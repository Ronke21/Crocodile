<text>DynCorp International Inc. (), was an American private military contractor. Starting as an aviation company, the company also provided flight operations support, training and mentoring, international development, intelligence training and support, contingency operations, security, and operations and maintenance of land vehicles. DynCorp received more than 96% of its more than $3 billion in annual revenue from the U.S. federal government. The corporate headquarters were in an unincorporated part of Fairfax County near Falls Church, Virginia, while the company&#x27;s contracts were managed from its office at Alliance Airport in Fort Worth, Texas. DynCorp provided services for the U.S. military in several theaters, including Bolivia, Bosnia, Somalia, Angola, Haiti, Colombia, Kosovo and Kuwait. It also provided much of the security for Afghan president Hamid Karzai&#x27;s presidential guard and trained much of the police forces of Iraq and Afghanistan. DynCorp was also hired to assist recovery in Louisiana and neighboring areas after Hurricane Katrina. The company held one contract on every round of competition since receiving the first Contract Field Teams contract in 1951.

In 2020, Dyncorp was bought by Germantown, Maryland-based defense support services conglomerate Amentum. On April 21, 2021, the DynCorp name was discontinued, and employees and services transferred to Amentum.

==History==
===California Eastern Aviation (1946–1961)===
California Eastern Aviation was incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 1946. It operated as a common carrier from then until 1948, flying freight between east and west coasts, one of the largest domestic freight operators of the time. Unfortunately, this was not profitable, and the company entered bankruptcy in May 1948, ceasing common carrier activities and leasing out its aircraft instead, which enabled it to exit bankruptcy in 1950. It then became an uncertificated carrier, flying for the US military. During the 1950s its California Eastern Airways division supported the Korean War, the DEW Line, US activities in the Philippines, French Indochina and maintained personnel in Tokyo, Hawaii, Wake Island, one of the largest such operators. The airline flew both Douglas DC-4s and Lockheed Constellations. In 1959, the carrier received interim certification as a supplemental air carrier at which time it had two divisions (the airline operation and Flight Training) and two subsidiaries, Land-Air and Air Carrier Service Corp. Land-Air held contracts performing instrumentation and R&amp;D activities at White Sands Missile Range. In 1960, California Eastern sold its airline operations to President Airlines.

DynCorp traces its origins from two companies formed in 1946: California Eastern Airways (CEA), an air freight business, and Land-Air Inc., an aircraft maintenance company. California Eastern Airways was founded by a small group of returning World War II pilots who wanted to break into the air cargo business. They were one of the first firms to ship cargo by air, and within a year, the firm was serving both coasts. California Eastern Airways diversified into multiple government aviation and managerial jobs, airlifted supplies for the Korean War, and was responsible for the White Sands Missile Range (a client that DynCorp has retained for 50 years).

In 1951 Land-Air Inc., which implemented the first Contract Field Teams (teams of technicians that maintained military aircraft for the United States Air Force), was bought by California Eastern Aviation Inc. DynCorp still holds the contract 50 years later, maintaining rotary and fixed-wing aircraft for all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. At this time, revenues for the company reached $6 million.

In 1952 the company, renamed California Eastern Aviation, Inc., merged with Air Carrier Service Corporation (AIRCAR), which sold commercial aircraft and spare parts to foreign airlines and governments.

===Dynalectron (1962–1987)===
By 1961 California Eastern Aviation needed a new name to reflect the growing and diversifying company. The name &quot;Dynalectron Corporation&quot; was selected from 5,000 employee suggestions. In 1976 Dynalectron established headquarters in McLean, Virginia. Due to its growing size, the company restructured into four main operating groups: Specialty Contracting, Energy, Government Services, and Aviation Services. In the 30 years since the foundation of CEA, Dynalectron had acquired 19 companies in 30 years, had assets of $88 million, maintained a backlog of $250 million, employed 7,000, and had annual sales of $300 million.

In 1964 Dynalectron diversified into the energy services business with the acquisition of Hydrocarbon Research, Inc. Through this acquisition Dynalectron developed a process called H-Coal, which converted coal into synthetic liquid fuels. The work began to attract national attention with the Arab Oil Embargos of the 1970s. By the early 1980s Texaco, Ruhrkohle and Itochu were all marketing Dynalectron&#x27;s H-Oil process.

Between 1976 and 1981 the company had two public stock offerings and acquired another 14 companies. By 1986 Dynaelectron was one of the largest defense contractors in North America.

===DynCorp and expansion (1987–2003)===

In 1987 Dynalectron changed its name to DynCorp. In 1988 DynCorp went private to avoid a hostile takeover by Miami financier Victor Posner, via an employee initiative led by Daniel R. Bannister. Bannister, as T. Rees Shapiro wrote in his 2011 obituary, &quot;was paid $1.65 an hour when he joined DynCorp as an electronics technician in 1953,&quot; rising to serve as its president and CEO (1985 to 1997).

In 1994 DynCorp&#x27;s revenues were approximately $1 billion. In 1997, DynCorp partnered with British company Porton International to form DynPort Vaccine Group. That same year, DynPort was contracted by the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) of the United States Department of Defense to manufacture 300,000 doses of a new smallpox vaccine for the military.

By the time of his retirement in 2003, Shapiro notes that Bannister &quot;oversaw the acquisition of more than 40 companies… [and] was credited with helping to mold… an aviation services company into a sprawling conglomerate that employed 24,000 people and earned $2.4 billion in annual revenue.&quot; As well he &quot;oversaw DynCorp contracts to operate missile test ranges for the Defense Department, develop vaccines for the National Institutes of Health and install security systems in U.S. embassies for the State Department.&quot; Shapiro notes that during Bannister&#x27;s tenure Dyncorp had also &quot;supplied bodyguards to Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide in the 1990s and to Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the early 2000s.&quot;

With the reductions in military spending in the 1990s, DynCorp expanded their focus to the growing tech market. It bought 19 digital and network service firms and acquired contracts with the government&#x27;s information technology (IT) departments. By 2003 roughly half of DynCorp&#x27;s business came from managing the IT departments of the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, among others. In 1999 DynCorp moved its headquarters to Reston, Virginia.

In December 2000 DynCorp formed DynCorp International LLC, and transferred all its international business to this entity. DynCorp Technical Services LLC continued to perform DynCorp&#x27;s domestic contracts.

===Sale to CSC, IPO, and purchase by Cerberus Capital (2003–2020)===
In March 2003 DynCorp and its subsidiaries were acquired by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for approximately $914 million. Less than two years later, CSC announced the sale of three DynCorp units (DynCorp International, DynMarine and certain DynCorp Technical Services contracts) to Veritas Capital Fund, LP for $850 million. After the sale, CSC retained the rights to the name &quot;DynCorp&quot; and the new company became DynCorp International.

In 2006 DynCorp International went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
DCP.

On April 12, 2010, DynCorp International announced a conditional deal to be acquired by private equity investment firm Cerberus Capital Management for $17.55 per share ($1 billion). The deal was agreed on 7 July 2010.

In December 2011 the company hired Michael Thibault, former co-chairman and commissioner of the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan (CWC), as vice president of government finance and compliance. Thibault worked for many years at the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), serving as deputy director from 1994 to 2005. In 2011 Dyncorp set a company record with 12,300 new hires, bringing the total number of employees to 27,000.

=== Acquisition by Amentum (2020–present) ===
On November 23, 2020, Amentum, a contractor supporting U.S. federal and allied governments, announced that it has closed the acquisition of DynCorp International (due to multiple human trafficking cases), a provider of sophisticated aviation, logistics, training, intelligence and operational solutions in over 30 countries worldwide. The combination has also created one of the largest providers of mission critical support services to government customers, with 34,000 team members in 105 countries around the world.

==Services==
===Air operations===

DynCorp International provides aviation support to reduce the flow of illicit drugs, strengthen law enforcement, and eliminate terrorism. Their air operations include the operation of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft on and around aircraft carriers for either combat or non-combat missions, aviation life support missions, and aerial/satellite imagery. DynCorp was hired to strengthen the Afghan air force, helping to train Afghan pilots so they could, in turn, train other Afghans. They have also provided air operations support in Iraq, including search and rescue, medical evacuations, and transporting quick reaction forces.

===Aviation===
DynCorp International began as an aeronautical company in the 1950s and continues to provide aviation support globally. Aviation support including emergency response air programs, aircraft maintenance, theater aviation support management, helicopter maintenance support, supportability and testing.

In 2012 DynCorp played a key part in the Space Shuttle Endeavour&#x27;s final flight as it made its way from the Kennedy Space Center in Orlando to the California Science Center in Los Angeles aboard NASA&#x27;s specially crafted Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA). The SCA was a uniquely configured Boeing 747-100 aircraft. DynCorp mechanics worked with NASA and other support contractors performed maintenance and inspection services to the SCA. DynCorp&#x27;s involvement in Endeavour&#x27;s final flight was part of a contract NASA awarded to the company in April 2012 to provide aircraft maintenance and operational support at various locations throughout the country.

====Emergency response air programs====
DynCorp has been working with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (known as CAL FIRE) to suppress and control wild land fire. DynCorp flies and maintains Grumman S-2 Tracker fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes.

====Aircraft maintenance====
DynCorp provides aircraft maintenance, fleet testing and evaluation for rotary, fixed, &quot;lighter-than-air&quot;, and unmanned aircraft. Specifically, they provide on-site work for project testing, transient, loaner, leased and tested civilian aircraft services. DynCorp also performs supportability and safety studies as well as off-site aircraft safety and spill containment patrols and aircraft recovery services. DynCorp has received contracts for aircraft maintenance with the United States Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army, and NASA. DynCorp provides aircraft maintenance in countries including the Republic of the Philippines, the United States, throughout Europe, Southwest Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Additionally, DynCorp provides aircraft maintenance support to facilities including the NAS Patuxent River, Johnson Space Center in Houston, the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, NASA facilities in El Paso, Texas, Edwards Air Force Base in California, and Robins Air Force Base (AFB) in Georgia.

Among its notable awards is its unbroken record of having received a contract in every round of competition under the United States Air Force-managed Contract Field Teams (CFT) program since the CFT program started in 1951.

The company recently opened up an office in Huntsville, Alabama, to allow it to further focus on its aviation business. The Army Materiel Command, Army Contracting Command and the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command all have or soon will have their headquarters on Redstone Arsenal. The U.S. Air Force chose DynCorp to supply support services for the military&#x27;s T-6 and T-6B trainer aircraft. As part of that contract DynCorp will open, operate and manage Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply facilities at nine Air Force and Navy locations.

====Helicopter maintenance support====
DynCorp International has been the incumbent recipient of helicopter maintenance and support contracts supporting the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Navy. It also received the task order to provide theater aviation support management for US Army helicopters in Europe (TASM-E). The U.S. Army Contracting Command gave DynCorp International a contract to provide a maintenance augmentation team for the Kuwait Air Force&#x27;s AH-64D Apache helicopter maintenance program. DynCorp has worked as a partner for supporting the Air Force&#x27;s fleet of 39 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft program since 1997.

===Contingency operations===
A significant part of the company&#x27;s business since the 1990s has come from contingency operations support. The company supports existing bases in Southern Afghanistan, builds new ones as needed, and provides base support services.

===Development===

In January 2010 DynCorp International combined with World Wide Humanitarian Services (WWHS) and Casals &amp; Associates to form DI Development. DI Development provides humanitarian aid, reconstruction to conflict and post-conflict areas, and governance reforms.

DynCorp International made several acquisitions in 2009 and 2010 to adapt to the defense sector&#x27;s shift towards diplomacy and development work, in particular acquiring an international development firm in order to enter the international aid community. DI Development is particularly active in Africa and Latin America. In Africa DI Development strengthened government financial management in Ghana, assisted in peace and recovery advancement in Uganda, and led anti-corruption programs in Madagascar, Malawi, and Nigeria. In Latin America DI Development implemented anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability programs in Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama, and provided democracy and governance initiatives in Mexico, Bolivia, and the Dominican Republic.

===Intelligence training and solutions===
In 2010 DynCorp International acquired Phoenix Consulting Group to expand the company into intelligence training and solutions. By acquiring the Phoenix Consulting Group, DynCorp provides training courses to the intelligence community at the Phoenix Training Center. Dyncorp International employs 300 intelligence professionals to offer highly specialized training for intelligence, counterintelligence, special operations and law enforcement personnel. It also provides linguist operations, including language training, translation specialists recruiting, and field translation support for the U.S. armed forces.

Through a joint venture with McNeil Technologies called Global Linguist Solutions, Dyncorp was awarded a five-year contract to provide management of translation and interpretation services to support U.S. Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Under the contract, DynCorp employed 6,000 locally hired translators and 1,000 U.S. citizens who are native speakers of languages spoken in Iraq. DynCorp International was also given a $17.1 million task order to provide leadership to military personnel of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The program focuses on training junior and mid-level personnel in areas such as communications, logistics, and engineering.

DynCorp president Steven Schorer expects the training and support logistics for the military and intelligence community to grow significantly in the coming years.

Two DynCorp American employees were among the five killed in Jordan by a co-worker on 9 November 2015. The incident occurred at the International Police Training Centre in Zarqa. The program the men were working on is funded by the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.

===Operations and maintenance===
DynCorp provides military base operations and vehicle maintenance. They manage installations for military bases for the Department of Defense and the Department of State, and provide security services, fire and rescue emergency services, and IT/telecommunication services. In particular, DynCorp supports a military base camp in Kosovo, providing power plant maintenance, fueling services, and grounds maintenance. DynCorp is also active in vehicular maintenance, in particular providing the United Arab Emirates with depot-level maintenance, facilities management, and commercialization for its 17,000 ground vehicles. In April 2012 DynCorp International was awarded a contract with the U.S. Navy to provide facility support services for personnel from the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion unit Timor-Leste, including living quarters, internet and telephone services, bathroom facilities, laundry services, kitchen facilities, vehicle/driver/language support, procurement services, warehousing and other services.

DynCorp also formed a joint venture with Oshkosh Defense, Force Protection Industries, and McLane Advanced Technologies to pursue a $3 billion five-year Army contract for support and maintenance of mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles. The U.S. Defense Department gave DynCorp the Nunn-Perry Award in recognition of its mentor-protege arrangement with CenterScope Technologies, in which it provided coaching in development of new markets, establishing international operations and in worldwide logistics. As a result of this mentoring CTSI&#x27;s revenue grew from $5 million to $32 million in 18 months.

===Security services===
DynCorp provides personal security throughout various parts of the world. It supplies Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East with threat assessment protection, perimeter security, base security, and guard services. DynCorp supported the U.S. Army in the Persian Gulf with vehicle searches, roving patrols, and explosive-detecting dogs. It also provides personal security to many regions of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Culpeper National Security Solutions is a unit of DynCorp.

===Training and mentoring===
DynCorp delivers training for multiple sectors, including security sector reform, interior and defense personnel in underdeveloped nations, and law enforcement. Since 1994 DynCorp has trained and deployed 6,000 law enforcement workers in 16 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan. DynCorp is looking to partner with Raytheon as a prime or subcontractor on the Teach, Educate, Coach program, which is part of the Army&#x27;s Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support program.

==Controversies==
===Latin America incidents===
In September 2001 Ecuadorian farmers filed a class-action lawsuit against DynCorp. On February 15, 2013, the court granted summary judgment to DynCorp, dismissing the sole remaining human health and medical monitoring claims Ecuadorian plaintiffs had brought in connection with counternarcotic aerial herbicide spraying operations in southern Colombia. The plaintiffs are preparing to appeal the dismissal.

An extensive accusation concerning DynCorp&#x27;s activities and alleged abuses in Colombia was presented against DynCorp at the Hearing on Biodiversity of the Permanent Peoples&#x27; Tribunal, session on Colombia at the Cacarica Humanitarian Zone from February 24 to 27, 2007.

Three DynCorp employees died when their helicopter was shot down during an anti-drug mission in Peru in 1992.

On November 29, 2008, a lengthy article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; questioned the potential conflict of interest in the hiring by Veritas Capital Fund, LP, holding company for DynCorp, of Gen. Barry McCaffrey. McCaffrey had previously served as White House &quot;Drug Czar&quot;, where he shaped future federal public-private partnership in drug enforcement policy.

===Sex trafficking of children in Bosnia===
According to Human Rights Watch, there is substantial evidence that points to the involvement of DynCorp contractors in trafficking of women and girls in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as violence against them.

In the late 1990s two employees, Ben Johnston, a former DynCorp aircraft mechanic, and Kathryn Bolkovac, a U.N. International Police Force monitor, independently alleged that DynCorp employees in Bosnia engaged in sex with minors and sold them to each other as slaves. Johnston and Bolkovac were fired, and Johnston was later placed into protective custody before leaving several days later.

On June 2, 2000, an investigation was launched in the DynCorp hangar at Comanche Base Camp, one of two U.S. bases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all DynCorp personnel were detained for questioning. CID spent several weeks investigating and the results appear to support Johnston&#x27;s allegations. DynCorp had fired five employees for similar illegal activities prior to the charges. Many of the employees accused of sex trafficking were forced to resign under suspicion of illegal activity. As of 2014 no one had been prosecuted.

In 2002 Bolkovac filed a lawsuit in Great Britain against DynCorp for unfair dismissal due to a protected disclosure (whistleblowing), and won. Bolkovac co-authored a book with Cari Lynn titled &quot;The Whistleblower: Sex Trafficking, Military Contractors And One Woman&#x27;s Fight For Justice&quot;. In 2010 the film &quot;The Whistleblower&quot;, starring Rachel Weisz and Vanessa Redgrave, was released.

===Iraq incidents===
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) found that &quot;DynCorp seemed to act almost independently of its reporting officers at the Department of State, billing the United States for millions of dollars of work that were not authorized and beginning other jobs without a go-ahead.&quot; The report states that the findings of DynCorp&#x27;s misconduct on a $188 million job to buy weapons and build quarters for the Iraqi police were serious enough to warrant a fraud inquiry. A U.S. government audit report of October 2007 revealed that $1.3 billion was spent on a contract with DynCorp for training Iraqi police. The auditors stated that the program was mismanaged to such an extent that they were unable to determine how the money was spent.

In February 2007 federal auditors cited DynCorp for wasting millions on projects, including building an unapproved, Olympic-sized swimming pool at the behest of Iraqi police officials. In April 2011 DynCorp agreed to pay $7.7 million to the U.S. government to settle claims that it had inflated claims for construction contracts in Iraq.

On October 11, 2007, a DynCorp security guard in a U.S. State Department convoy killed a taxi driver in Baghdad. According to several witnesses, the taxi did not pose a threat to the convoy&#x27;s security.

A January 2010 SIGIR report assessed that oversight of DynCorp police training contracts by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs found that INL exhibited weak oversight of the DynCorp task orders for support of the Iraqi police training program. It found that INL lacks sufficient resources and controls to adequately manage the task orders with DynCorp. As a result, more than $2.5 billion in U.S. funds were vulnerable to waste and fraud, although SIGIR&#x27;s Iraq reconstruction inspector Stuart Bowen noted that there was no indication that DynCorp had misspent any of the $2.5 billion.

===Afghanistan incidents===
In 2009 DynCorp contractors paid a 15-year-old Afghan Bacha Bazi performer to perform lap dances and entertain them in Kunduz. Several Afghans were later arrested and investigated. A Wikileaks cable released after the incident stated that the Afghan interior minister at the time, Hanif Atmar, asked the assistant U.S. ambassador to try to &quot;quash&quot; both the story and release of video from the incident. In response to the incident, DynCorp fired four senior managers and established a chief compliance officer position, which focused on ethics, business conduct, related investigations, and regulatory compliance.

On July 30, 2010, a riot broke out when an Afghan car and a DynCorp vehicle crashed on a road near Kabul International Airport. Although initial reports blamed the company and claimed four Afghans were killed in the accident, Sayed Abdul Ghaffar, the head of the Kabul police criminal investigations division, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Afghan driver had caused the accident and said only one Afghan died in the wreck.

===Mozambique incident===
According to Mozambican media reports, the Mozambican government seized and impounded the 16-vehicle shipment pending the outcome of investigations into alleged tax evasion and deception by OTT Technologies Mozambique.

=== Trump administration lobbying ===
DynCorp lobbied the Trump administration intensely to get the Trump administration to rescind a $10 billion contract that the Obama administration made with a rival company to service State Department aircraft.

<text>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (), also known by the initialism DDLJ, is a 1995 Indian Hindi-language musical romance film written and directed by Aditya Chopra in his directorial debut and produced by his father Yash Chopra. Released on 20 October 1995, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as Raj and Simran, two young non-resident Indians, who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran&#x27;s family so the couple can marry, but Simran&#x27;s father has long since promised her hand to his friend&#x27;s son. The film was shot in India, London, and Switzerland, from September 1994 to August 1995.

With an estimated total gross of 102.5 crore (today&#x27;s adjusted gross 524 crore), with 89 crore (today&#x27;s adjusted gross 455 crore) earned in India and 13.50 crore (today&#x27;s adjusted gross 69 crore) in overseas, the film was the highest-grossing Indian film of 1995 and one of the most successful Indian films in history. When adjusted for inflation, it is the second highest-grossing Indian film of the 1990s, behind &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; It won 10 Filmfare Awards—the most for a single film at that time—and the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.

The film received widespread acclaim from critics. Many critics praised performances of Kajol and Khan as well as their chemistry, and the film&#x27;s blend of simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one&#x27;s own heart. Its success led other filmmakers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style and homages to specific scenes. &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, and was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of top Indian films of all time. In 2012, the film was included by critics Rachel Dwyer and Sanam Hasan in the 2012 British Film Institute &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; 1,000 greatest films of all time. It is considered as the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema, because it is still being shown at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai as of November 2024.

== Plot ==
Simran lives with her conservative family in the suburbs of London. Her father, Baldev, is a strict disciplinarian, who does not encourage spending time outside or engaged in frivolous activities. Simran has been betrothed since birth, to marry a man named Kuljeet, who is the son of Baldev&#x27;s friend in Punjab.

Following their graduation, Simran&#x27;s friends wish to travel across Europe. Simran asks her father for permission to go on the trip, and he agrees. Also on the trip, in a separate party, is Raj, who is accompanying his friends despite having failed in college. Raj and Simran meet on the train, and immediately dislike each other. Raj is flirtatious with every girl he meets, but Simran prefers to keep to herself.

While stopping at Zurich, Raj and Simran both try to buy souvenirs and end up missing their train. Stranded alone in a foreign country, they decide to travel together to catch up with the rest of their group. Simran opens up to Raj, who confesses having had many girlfriends. Eventually, they reunite with their friends towards the end of the trip, but both have fallen in love with each other. When Simran&#x27;s father hears of this, he immediately moves the family to Punjab so Simran can marry Kuljeet.

Raj shows up at Simran&#x27;s London address, but finds out that she has left. He follows her to India, where they reunite in the village outside her current residence. Raj and Simran wish to marry, but Raj does not want her to elope with him. Instead, he hopes to win over Simran&#x27;s family during the months-long festivities before the wedding, so that they can agree to the match themselves. He befriends Kuljeet while out hunting, and Kuljeet unwittingly introduces Raj to his and Simran&#x27;s family.

Raj stays at Kuljeet&#x27;s house, and becomes the center of the wedding party. He attracts the attention of Kuljeet&#x27;s sister, Preeti, during his stay, and Preeti&#x27;s parents decide to ask Raj&#x27;s father to arrange their marriage. Raj&#x27;s father, Dharamvir, arrives in Punjab and immediately agrees to the match, not knowing that Raj is in love with Simran and not Preeti. On the eve of Simran&#x27;s wedding, Raj and Simran discuss eloping again, but Raj rejects the idea.

The next day, Baldev discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran in Europe. He realises Raj is the boy she fell in love with on her trip, and throws Raj out of the house. On the train station, Raj and Kuljeet start brawling. Raj wins the fight when Kuljeet attacks Dharamvir, but spares his life. As the train is about to depart, Simran begs Baldev to let her go with Raj. Seeing the love his daughter feels for him, Baldev agrees. Raj pulls Simran on the train, similar to the way they first met in London.

=== Origin and scripting ===
Aditya Chopra assisted his father, director and producer Yash Chopra, during the making of &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989), &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991) and &quot;Darr&quot; (1993). During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000). For three years, he worked on the story that would become &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; before approaching his father to direct it. Yash did not want to and tried to persuade Aditya to do it himself. As they were discussing ideas for the script, Aditya conceived the notion that Raj would seek permission for marriage from Simran&#x27;s stern father, rather than eloping with her. He then became excited about the possibility of directing the film himself. After his mother, the playback singer Pamela Chopra, agreed that the idea was sound, he decided to make this his directorial debut. Aditya wanted to make a wholesome film that people could watch repeatedly. He wanted to diverge from the typical plot line of the time, in which lovers run away when their parents object, and show that if their love was strong enough, the parents would eventually understand.

In May 1994, Aditya read the first draft of the script to several members of the Yash Raj Films production team assigned to work with him, including a cinematographer, an art director, and a dialogue writer. They were not impressed, but Aditya held fast to his ideas. He was given total editorial control by his father, the producer, and made the film according to his own tastes and sensibilities. Aditya struggled with both the dialogue writer Javed Siddiqui and the song lyricist Anand Bakshi to develop words that were &quot;young-sounding&quot;. There were personal clashes over writing credits on the final script. Pamela&#x27;s friend Honey Irani believed she deserved a writing credit that she did not receive, and Siddiqui believed Aditya did not deserve partial credit for the dialogue. After &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, neither of them ever worked with Yash Raj Films again. After approving the script, Yash was consulted about the songs, but mostly left the creative process to his son, and has firmly denied that he was a ghost director on the project. He did not shoot a single frame, and did not even view some portions of the film until it was nearly completed.

=== Casting ===
Aditya originally wanted the film to be about a relationship between an Indian and an American. He wanted Tom Cruise for the male lead but was dissuaded by Yash, who did not want to use a foreign star. They decided their characters would be non-resident Indians (NRIs). Aditya approached Shah Rukh Khan to play the role of Raj. Shah Rukh was initially not interested because of the romantic nature of the role, having had success playing villainous roles. Aditya then asked Saif Ali Khan to play the lead role because he was having problems persuading Shah Rukh to do it. Saif declined for unknown reasons, as did Aamir Khan, causing Aditya to continue pursuing Shah Rukh. Aditya and Shah Rukh had four meetings over several weeks; he finally persuaded Shah Rukh by telling him he could never be a superstar unless he became &quot;every woman&#x27;s dream man, and every mother&#x27;s dream son&quot;. Since then, Shah Rukh has expressed his gratitude to Aditya for helping to make him a star with this film. Shah Rukh said that fellow actor Salman Khan also encouraged him to do the role, saying that he thought the film would be very successful. Shah Rukh has also noted the similarities in the film&#x27;s script to his own relationship with Gauri Khan before their marriage.

Kajol was the first choice to play Simran, to which she quickly agreed. She and Shah Rukh had previously worked together in the successful films &quot;Baazigar&quot; (1993) and &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; (1995). Kajol said her character was very difficult for her to relate to, whereas Shah Rukh said Raj&#x27;s personality was very similar to his own. Aditya chose the name Raj for the character, and the mandolin that he played, based on his admiration for the actor Raj Kapoor. After a successful screen test, Parmeet Sethi was chosen over Armaan Kohli and Milind Gunaji for the role of Kuljeet Singh. In addition to his assistant director Sameer Sharma, Aditya asked for two additional assistants, his brother Uday Chopra along with Karan Johar. Johar also played a small role in the film as Raj&#x27;s friend. Sharmishta Roy was the film&#x27;s art director and Manish Malhotra was its costume designer. While Malhotra had many new ideas, Aditya wanted to keep the clothing style simple; he did not want it to distract from the story. Despite this, Malhotra was responsible for the idea of Simran wearing a green dress in the song &quot;Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna&quot;, an unusual colour for a Punjabi bride.

=== Filming ===

&quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; was filmed in several 5-, 10- and 20-day schedules between September1994 and August1995. The first sequence filmed was for the song &quot;Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko&quot; with Kajol and Shah Rukh in Switzerland. The European journey scenes and songs were mainly filmed in Saanen, Montbovon and Gstaad, Switzerland. Other scenes were shot in England, at locations including Trafalgar Square, King&#x27;s Cross railway station and Angel Underground station. Film&#x27;s cinematographer Manmohan Singh, a regular collaborator with Chopra, shot the song &quot;Tujhe Dekha To&quot;, including the iconic mustard fields scenes with Shah Rukh and Kajol in the mustard fields in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the National Capital Region Delhi. The cast faced difficulties while filming the final scene, which shows Simran running to catch the train on which Raj is travelling. The smouldering heat made it difficult to shoot and each time there was a retake, the train took 20 minutes to return.

Saroj Khan was the choreographer throughout most of the production, but after several disputes between her and Aditya, she was replaced by Farah Khan near the end of the shoot. After the film&#x27;s eventual success, Saroj apologised to Aditya for underestimating him, but she never worked with him again. Farah choreographed the song &quot;Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane&quot;, during which Aditya did not tell Kajol that Shah Rukh was going to drop her, as he wanted to capture her genuine reaction. The film&#x27;s title was suggested by actress Kirron Kher; it came from the song &quot;Le Jayenge Le Jayenge&quot;, in the film &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; (1974). The Raj character sings parts of this song during the story, and it recurs at the end. &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; is believed to be the first Bollywood film with a &quot;Title suggested by&quot; credit. The film has since become universally known by the acronym &quot;DDLJ&quot;.

Towards the end of the principal photography, Shah Rukh had to split his time between this film and &quot;Trimurti&quot; (1995), spending half of his day on each film. In early August1995, when filming on &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; was not yet finished, a release date in October around the time of the Diwali festival was decided upon. Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September. After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the processes. On 18 October, two days before the film&#x27;s release, the 30-minute special &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making&quot; was broadcast on television by Doordarshan.

== Themes ==
&quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence. To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story&#x27;s &quot;good guy&quot;, whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners. Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indian citizens.

The story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism. Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father&#x27;s plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend&#x27;s father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires. The film implies that &quot;Indianness&quot; can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.

In &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, the purity/sanctity of women is being related to that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: &quot;You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl&#x27;s &quot;izzat&quot; (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night.&quot; This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system, and the man&#x27;s responsibility to protect the Indian woman&#x27;s sexual purity. In &quot;The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films&quot;, Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj&#x27;s father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran&#x27;s mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams.

Scott Jordan Harris, writing for Roger Ebert&#x27;s website, says the film&#x27;s popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, &quot;It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will&quot;. Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage. According to Patricia Uberoi, &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; reiterates the theme of &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994) in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian.

== Music ==

The &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; soundtrack features seven songs composed by Jatin–Lalit, a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit. Anand Bakshi wrote the lyrics and Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet Bhattacharya and Udit Narayan performed the vocals. Jatin–Lalit was considered for the job when singer Asha Bhosle contacted Yash Chopra after meeting the duo. It was their first collaboration with Yash Raj Films. They secured the job after singing &quot;Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna&quot; for Yash. In return, they ensured she sang one song, &quot;Zara Sa Jhoom Loon Main&quot;. Pamela Chopra helped them select tunes and instruments to give some of the songs a Punjabi flavour.

The soundtrack became the best-selling Bollywood soundtracks with sales ranging from 25million to over 100million. In 2005, the album was judged the top Hindi soundtrack of all time by voters on the BBC Asian Network website. The wedding song &quot;Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna&quot; from the film became an all-time hit; it is played at weddings across the South Asian diaspora.

== Track listing ==
== Release ==
&quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; opened on 20 October 1995 to sold-out shows worldwide. Every show in every theatre in Mumbai—save one—was completely full for the first week. The film was popular among both resident Indians and NRIs. At San Francisco&#x27;s 720-seat Naz theatre, 1,000 people arrived for the first showing, and the theatre staff were forced to run another show late that night. In the UK, the film ran for over a year. The Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai has been showing DDLJ for 28 years.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
The film opened with over grossed in its first month of release. The film&#x27;s initial Hindi run earned 1.13 billion (valued at about US$35,000,000 in 1995) in India and about 200 million (valued at about US$6,200,000 in 1995) overseas; it became the highest-grossing Indian film of the year, and the second-highest-grossing film of the 1990s, behind &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; It was the second Indian film to gross over 1 billion worldwide, and one of the biggest Bollywood earners of all time. The film went on to gross a total of () worldwide .

Adjusted for inflation, &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; is among the highest-grossing Hindi films ever; its domestic net income (533 million at the time) is approximately () when adjusted for inflation in 2017. As of 2009, the film had generated over in revenues for the Maratha Mandir since its release. In later years, that theatre ran one matinee show per day at reduced ticket prices, which averaged about 50% occupancy.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; received many favourable reviews. An initial review by weekly magazine &quot;Screen&quot; said of Aditya Chopra, &quot;A young master arrives&quot;. Tom Vick, reviewing the film for Allmovie, said, &quot;An immensely likeable movie, &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; performs the rarely achieved feat of stretching a predictable plot over three hours and making every minute enjoyable.&quot; When the film toured the US in 2004 as part of the Cinema India showcase, &quot;The Changing Face of Indian Cinema&quot;, Charles Taylor reviewed the film for &quot;Salon&quot; and said, &quot;It&#x27;s a flawed, contradictory movie—aggressive and tender, stiff and graceful, clichéd and fresh, sophisticated and naive, traditional and modern. It&#x27;s also, I think, a classic.&quot;

Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra said, &quot;Perhaps the innocence of Raj and Simran&#x27;s romance in which they can spend the night together without sex because Raj, the bratish &quot;[sic]&quot; NRI understands the importance of an Indian woman&#x27;s honor. Perhaps it&#x27;s the way in which the film artfully reaffirms the patriarchal status quo and works for all constituencies—the NRI and the local viewer. Or perhaps it&#x27;s the magic of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol who created a template for modern love, which was hip and cool but resolutely Indian.&quot; She also called the film a milestone that shaped Hindi cinema through the 1990s, and one of her personal favourites. In 2004, Meor Shariman of &quot;The Malay Mail&quot; called the film a &quot;must watch&quot; for Bollywood fans, and also for those seeking an introduction to Bollywood.

Raja Sen gave a reflective review for Rediff.com in 2005, calling the film one of the best Hindi films made in the previous 20 years. He said &quot;Shah Rukh Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the Lover for the 1990s with great panache&quot;, and called Kajol a &quot;real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity&quot; to her role. Sen called the film well balanced and said only the fight scene and some mother-daughter dialogue can wear after multiple viewings. Omer M. Mozaffar, writing for RogerEbert.com in 2012, likened the film to a Disney Princess story, saying, &quot;the young princess feeling trapped by the traditional patriarchy, seeking freedom through discovering the world, but finally finding it through silent, but inappropriate love. The Little Mermaid. Beauty (of the Beast). Jasmine (friends with Aladdin). Pocahontas. Aurora (Sleeping Beauty). And here, Simran.&quot; Scott Jordan Harris, also writing for RogerEbert.com in 2014, called it &quot;one of the world&#x27;s favorite films&quot;, and said it plays as a masterful soap opera, with one of the best screen couples ever seen.

== Accolades ==
&quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; was ranked among &quot;The Times of India&quot;″s list of the &quot;10 Bollywood movies you must see before you die&quot;. It was one of three Hindi films in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, the others being &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) and &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975). It was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of top Indian films of all time. It is one of the films on Box Office India&#x27;s list of &quot;Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema&quot;. The film won a National Film Award and 10 Filmfare Awards, setting the record at the time for the most Filmfare trophies.

== Legacy ==

=== Historic box office run ===
In 2001, &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; overtook &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), which had run for over five years at the Minerva theatre, as the longest-running film in Indian cinema history. It has been showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre (which was famous for having shown &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960) for three years) since its original release in 1995. There are often people in the audience who have seen the film 50 or more times, but still clap, cheer, mouth the dialogues and sing along with the songs, raising comparisons with &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), the longest running film in America.

When a theatre strike in early 2011 threatened the film&#x27;s uninterrupted run, the producer Yash Chopra contacted theatre owners to try and ensure the film would continue. He hoped the film would continue to run for at least 1,000 weeks, which it achieved in December2014. To commemorate the event, cast members including Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Anupam Kher, Farida Jalal, Mandira Bedi and Pooja Ruparel appeared on the television show &quot;Comedy Nights with Kapil&quot;. Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and director Aditya Chopra also attended a live chat with fans and a black tie event at the theatre on 12 December. The same day, they launched a coffee table book written by Aditya Chopra about the making of the film. Also in December, Yash Raj Films announced the availability of a collection of commemorative, licensed merchandise from various suppliers to mark the event.

The Maratha Mandir&#x27;s management ended the film&#x27;s run after 1,009 weeks on 19 February2015 because of low attendance (the last show was viewed by 210 people). However, after an outpouring of support from fans, and talks with the production company, they decided to reinstate the film. By March 16, 2020, it had been shown for 1,251 weeks (24 years), and the film continued to be screened as of 2023. The projectionist, who has been working at the Mandir for 46 years, has watched the film more than 9,000 times. The COVID-19 lockdown in India caused the theater to close for eight months; upon its re-opening in November 2020, screening of the film resumed.

=== Influence ===
&quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; spawned many imitators of its story and style, especially throughout the 1990s. According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema&quot;, it and a handful of other films and young directors started a trend for &quot;designer&quot; films. The authors said that these were &quot;a carefully packaged and branded product in which every little visual and physical detail ... is of utmost importance&quot;. In &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s Top 20: Superstars of Indian Cinema&quot;, Namrata Joshi said &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; &quot;reinvented Bollywood romances so decisively that we can neatly divide them into two eras—before &quot;DDLJ&quot; and after &quot;DDLJ&quot;&quot;.

Yash Raj Films was previously known for using locations outside India for item numbers in its films. &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; started the trend for films designed to appeal to the Indian diaspora, which have foreign locations as integral parts of the story. The characters are themselves diaspora and tend to be able to move with ease between India and the West. Some later films that followed this trend include &quot;Pardes&quot; (1997), &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001), &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003), &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot; (2005), &quot;Neal &#x27;n&#x27; Nikki&quot; (2005) and &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006). &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; became the first Hindi film blockbuster to feature NRIs as main characters. It helped to establish the diaspora market as a vital source of revenue for the industry; that market was seen as a safer financial investment than the desi market.

Several later films have paid homage to &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;. The Karan Johar-produced &quot;Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania&quot; (2014) was directly inspired by it. The films &quot;Bangaram&quot; (2006), &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007), &quot;Bodyguard&quot; (2011), &quot;Chalo Dilli&quot; (2011), &quot;Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani&quot; (2013) and &quot;Chennai Express&quot; (2013) include scenes similar to the climactic train sequence, wherein a woman is running to catch a moving train and is helped aboard by a man with his outstretched arm. The British film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008) contained a similar train scene, and its final dance sequence was partially shot at the same railway station as the &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; finale.

In October 2021, Aditya announced that he would be directing a Broadway musical entitled &quot;Come Fall In Love – The DDLJ Musical&quot;, based on the film. It will debut in the Broadway season of 2022–2023.

=== Impact ===
Audiences appreciated the screen chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who later worked together in several successful films including &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001), &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010), and &quot;Dilwale&quot; (2015), and are often referred to as one of Indian cinema&#x27;s most loved on-screen couples. Sogosurvey conducted an online survey in 2016 in which approximately 47% of the people who participated voted &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; as Bollywood&#x27;s most evergreen love story. Shah Rukh Khan credits this film with making him a star, and says it &quot;changed the entire scene for romantic movies of the 90s&quot;. During an interview in 2002, he said &quot;Whatever I&#x27;ll stand for as an actor, in the whole of my career, whenever it ends, it will start with and end at &quot;Dilwale&quot;&quot;. The actress Farida Jalal said the film gave her career a boost, saying she got many offers and &quot;could quote any price&quot;. It also helped the young careers of Pooja Ruparel, who received advertising offers, and of Sharmistha Roy.

The British Film Institute (BFI) commissioned a book about &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;. It was the first Hindi film chosen for a series of studies on international films, called &quot;BFI Modern Classics&quot;. The author was Anupama Chopra and the book was released in 2002. It was reissued in paperback by Harper-Collins as &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: The Making of a Blockbuster&quot; in 2004. After an unexpectedly long delay, the film was released on DVD by Yash Raj Films in 2002. The release included &quot;The Making&quot; and &quot;300 Weeks Celebration&quot; documentaries, &quot;Success Story&quot; (highlights from the film&#x27;s premiere), clips from the 41st Filmfare Awards ceremony and other interviews.

In 2006, members of the film crew were honoured at a dinner event to celebrate the film&#x27;s 500th week since release. It was hosted by the Consulate General of Switzerland in Mumbai and by Switzerland Tourism. In 2010, Yash Raj Films signed an agreement with Indian and Swiss tour companies to provide a tour package called &quot;YRF Enchanted Journey&quot;, to allow visitors to Switzerland to view filming locations used for famous Yash Raj films including &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;. In 2014, Yash Raj Films released &quot;Aditya Chopra Relives ... Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (As Told to Nasreen Munni Kabir)&quot;, an attractive but expensive book about the making of the film. In response to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi quoting the line &quot;May the force be with you&quot; from the American film franchise &quot;Star Wars&quot; during a visit to the United States, the then US President Barack Obama decided to quote a line from a Hindi film during his visit to India in January2015. He chose a line from this film, &quot;Senorita, bade bade deshon mein ...&quot; (Miss, in large countries ...), and added &quot;you know what I mean&quot;. In February 2020, the then US President Donald Trump mentioned &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; as a classic Indian film during his visit to India. In the same month, the Australian actor Chris Hemsworth recited the complete dialogue &quot;Bade bade deshon mein aisi chhoti chhoti baatein hoti rehti hai&quot; (Small things like this happen in big countries), and said that he is a fan of the film.

== Re-release ==
The film was re-released in theaters on 10 February 2023, earning ₹10 lakh on its opening day and grossing over ₹22.50 lakh in its first weekend.

<text>Michael Abrash is an American programmer and technical writer. He has written dozens of magazine articles and multiple books on code optimization and software-rendered graphics for IBM PC compatibles. He worked at id Software in the mid-1990s on the rendering technology for &quot;Quake&quot;. He later wrote the Pixomatic software renderer for RAD Game Tools. Since 2014, he has been the chief scientist of Oculus VR, a subsidiary of Meta Platforms. 

Abrash started his career in 1982 writing action video games for the IBM PC, which eventually resulted in a 1990 book, &quot;Zen of Assembly Language Volume 1: Knowledge&quot;, about optimization for the 16-bit 8086 and 8088 processors. He began writing about programming the EGA and VGA hardware of IBM PC compatibles for &quot;Programmer&#x27;s Journal&quot; in the late 1980s, followed by a column for &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; in the early 1990s. In the latter, he introduced a method of adjusting VGA mode 13h to have a resolution of 320×240 with square pixels, which he called Mode X. He also used his &quot;Dr. Dobbs&#x27;s&quot; column to write about the details of his work on &quot;Quake&quot;

==Game programmer==

Abrash began writing video games the early days of the IBM PC and the Color Graphics Adapter. His first commercial game was a clone of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; published by Datamost in 1982 as &quot;Space Strike&quot;. He followed it with &quot;Cosmic Crusader&quot; (1982) and &quot;Big Top&quot; (1983), both published by Funtastic. Working with Dan Illowsky, who had previously programmed the Apple II &quot;Pac-Man&quot; clone &quot;Snack Attack&quot;, he co-wrote &quot;Snack Attack II&quot; (1982) for the IBM PC. All of his IBM PC games were written in 8086 assembly language.

After working at Microsoft on graphics and assembly code for Windows NT 3.1, he was hired by id Software in the mid-1990s to work on &quot;Quake&quot;. Some of the technology behind &quot;Quake&quot; is documented in Abrash&#x27;s &quot;Ramblings in Realtime&quot; published in &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;. He mentions Quake as his favourite game of all time. After &quot;Quake&quot; was released, Abrash returned to Microsoft to work on natural language research, then moved to the Xbox team until 2001.

In 2002, Abrash went to RAD Game Tools where he co-wrote the Pixomatic software renderer, which emulates the functionality of a DirectX 7-level graphics card. At the end of 2005, Pixomatic was acquired by Intel. When developing Pixomatic, he and Mike Sartain designed a new architecture called Larrabee, which now is part of Intel&#x27;s GPGPU project.

Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve, said that he had &quot;been trying to hire Michael Abrash forever. &quot;[...]&quot; About once a quarter we go for dinner and I say &#x27;are you ready to work here yet? In 2011 Abrash joined Valve.

On March 28, 2014, three days after Facebook announced agreements to purchase the virtual reality headset company, Oculus VR published a statement saying that Michael Abrash had joined their company as Chief Scientist. This reunited him with id Software&#x27;s John Carmack, who was chief technology officer there at the time.

==Technical writer==
Michael Abrash was a columnist in the 1980s for the magazine &quot;Programmer&#x27;s Journal&quot;. The articles were collected in the 1989 book, &quot;Power Graphics Programming&quot;. His second book, &quot;Zen of Assembly Language Volume 1: Knowledge&quot; (1990), is about writing efficient assembly code for the 16-bit 8086 processor, but was released after the 80486 CPU was already being used in IBM PC compatibles. Volume 2 was never published.

In the early to mid-1990s, Abrash wrote a column about graphics programming for IBM PC compatibles for &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; called &quot;Ramblings in Realtime.&quot; In 1991, his column introduced Mode X: a 256 color 320x240 graphics mode with square pixels instead of the slightly elongated pixels of the standard 320x200 mode. The same column covers a VGA feature allowing up to four pixels to be written at once—something which had not been widely documented outside of the VGA specification. The article and its follow-ups ignited interest among MS-DOS game programmers. &quot;Ramblings in Realtime&quot; also covered polygon drawing, 3D graphics, and texture mapping.

Much of the content of &quot;Zen of Assembly Language&quot; was updated in &quot;Zen of Code Optimization: The Ultimate Guide to Writing Software That Pushes PCs to the Limit&quot; (1994). 
In 1997 Abrash&#x27;s &quot;Graphics Programming Black Book&quot;, was published. It is a collection of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; articles and his work on the &quot;Quake&quot; graphic subsystem.

Abrash stopped writing publicly in the 2000s until maintaining a public blog at Valve, &quot;Ramblings in Valve Time&quot;, from April 2012 until January 2014.

<text>A private military company (PMC) or private military and security company (PMSC) is a private company providing armed combat or security services for financial gain. PMCs refer to their personnel as &quot;security contractors&quot; or &quot;private military contractors&quot;.

The services and expertise offered by PMCs are typically similar to those of governmental security, military, or police but most often on a smaller scale. PMCs often provide services to train or supplement official armed forces in service of governments, but they can also be employed by private companies to provide bodyguards for key staff or protection of company premises, especially in hostile territories. However, contractors that use armed force in a war zone may be considered unlawful combatants in reference to a concept that is outlined in the Geneva Conventions and explicitly stated by the 2006 American Military Commissions Act.

Private military companies carry out many missions and jobs. Some examples have included military aviation repair in East Africa, close protection for Afghan President Hamid Karzai and piloting reconnaissance airplanes and helicopters as a part of Plan Colombia. According to a 2003 study, the industry was then earning over $100 billion a year.

According to a 2008 study by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, private contractors make up 29% of the workforce in the United States Intelligence Community and cost the equivalent of 49% of their personnel budgets.

==History==
===Cold War===

Modern PMCs trace their origins back to a group of ex-SAS veterans in 1965 who, under the leadership of the founder of the SAS, David Stirling and John Woodhouse, founded WatchGuard International (formerly with offices in Sloane Street before moving to South Audley Street in Mayfair) as a private company that could be contracted out for security and military purposes.

The company&#x27;s first assignment was to go to Yemen to report on the state of the royalist forces when a ceasefire was declared. At the same time, Stirling was cultivating his contacts in the Iranian government and exploring the chances of obtaining work in Africa. The company eventually operated in Zambia and in Sierra Leone, providing training teams and advising on security matters. Stirling also organised deals to sell weapons and military personnel to other countries for various privatised foreign policy operations. Contracts were mainly with the Gulf States and involved weapons supply and training. The company was also linked with a failed attempt to overthrow Colonel Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya in 1971. Woodhouse resigned as Director of Operations after a series of disagreements and Stirling himself ceased to take an active part in 1972.

Stirling also founded KAS International (aka KAS Enterprises) and was involved in a collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature to forcibly reduce the illegal poaching and smuggling of elephant tusks in various countries of Southern Africa. Other groups formed by ex-SAS servicemen were established in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, including Control Risks Group and Defence Systems, providing military consultation and training.

====UN Mercenary Convention====

In 1989, the United Nations Mercenary Convention banning the use of mercenaries was initiated and entered into force on 20 October 2001. As of August 2021, the convention had been ratified by 37 states, and signed but not ratified by 9 states.

=== Post–Cold War ===
Dramatic growth in the number and size of PMCs occurred at the end of the Cold War. The exodus of over 6 million military personnel from Western militaries in the 1990s expanded the recruiting pool for PMCs. Some of the larger corporations included Vinnell and Military Professional Resources Inc. in the United States; G4S and Keeni-Meeny Services in the United Kingdom; and Lordan-Levdan in Israel and Executive Outcomes in South Africa.

Some commentators have argued that there was an exodus from many special operations forces across the globe towards these private military corporations. Units that were allegedly severely affected included the British Special Air Service, the US Special Operations Forces and the Canadian Joint Task Force 2.

The Center for Public Integrity reported that since 1994, the Defense Department entered into 3,601 contracts worth $300 billion with twelve US-based PMCs, specifically during the initial response after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.

Domestic operations are generally under the auspice of state or federal agencies such as the Department of Energy or the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Department of Defense. Driven by increasing fears of domestic terror attacks and civil unrest and disruption in the wake of disasters, more conventional security companies are moving into operations arenas that would fall within the definition of a PMC. The United States State Department also employs several companies to provide support in danger zones that would be difficult for conventional US forces.

The October 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing proved a pivotal moment for private military companies at sea and directly led to the first contract between Blackwater and the US military. Blackwater, and private military contractors in general, became notorious in the 21st century after their usage by the United States government in the American occupation of Iraq.

==== Seaborne PMCs ====

Since the late 2000s, PMCs have become increasingly involved in anti-piracy measures in Somalia and other regions. PMCs remain active in this region, mainly providing security for private shipping through the Gulf of Aden and at times contracting to aid UN efforts. PMCs were hired to deter pirates from attacking vessels and taking the shipping crew and their transport hostage. While a large variety of international naval missions with the same goals such as the EU&#x27;s Atalanta, NATO&#x27;s Ocean Shield, and Combined Task Force 150 are and were active in this region, it is still necessary for the shipping companies to have security personnel on deck. Due to their decentralized nature, it can be difficult for the UN or other international organizations to provide effective oversight over what happens on the seas. Whereas the UN showed that, between 2010 and 2015, there were over fifty encounters between the national sovereign navies that participated in the missions, resulting in over 1,200 detained pirates, only one PMC published information over this period. Since the PMCs are so much more active in this area, covering a larger part of it through activities on board trading ships, this could be a low estimate. PMC presence in Somalia is an example of two violent non-state actors at sea engaged in combat with each other.

====Airborne PMCs (2005)====
On April 5, 2005, Jamie Smith, CEO of SCG International Risk announced the expansion of services from the traditional roles of PMCs of protection and intelligence to military aviation support. SCG International Air would provide air support, medevac (medical evacuation), rotary and fixed-wing transportation, heavy-lift cargo, armed escort, and executive air travel to &quot;any location on earth.&quot; That marked an expansion of services to rival the capabilities of some countries&#x27; armies and air forces.

====2007 Uniform Code of Military Justice amendment====
In 2007, the American Uniform Code of Military Justice was amended to allow for prosecution of military contractors deployed in a &quot;declared war or a contingency operation.&quot;

==== International Code of Conduct (2008) ====

In 2008, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Swiss government, and contributors from private security companies and the civil society/NGO sector developed and proposed the Montreux Document on Private Military and Security Companies, detailing international legal obligations and specific recommendations related to PSC services procurement practices and operational oversight, as well as clarifying the obligations of states pertaining to the hiring of such entities during armed conflicts. As of December 2018, fifty-four states had signed the Montreux Document.

====NGO use of PMCs====
As revealed in 2009 by Stoddard &quot;et al.&quot;, the use of private security contractors by NGOs in dangerous regions is a highly sensitive subject. Quite often, the contractors hired are local companies and mostly are unarmed personnel guarding facilities; only rarely are international contractors or mobile armed security personnel used. Many NGOs have sought the services of private security contractors in dangerous areas of operation, such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Sudan, due to lack of knowledge, skills, and time to adequately meet the challenges of deteriorating security environments; and administrative costs of managing security in-house and potential to outsource the liability.
However, it has been argued that outsourcing security leaves NGOs reliant on contractors and unable to develop their own security thinking and make their own decisions. Perceived association of PSPs with state security, police or military services in turn compromises the ability of NGOs to claim neutrality, leading to increased risk. Moreover, outsourcing may not necessarily lead to lower costs, and the cost of middlemen may result in more poorly paid and poorly trained personnel, who turn over frequently and cannot adequately perform the job. Finally, NGOs have obligations beyond strictly legal liability that include political, ethical and reputational implications: If the organisation&#x27;s responsibility to prevent and mitigate any possible negative outcomes is better achieved through in-house security, it is argued, this should be their choice.

The result is that many NGOs are not open about their use of PSPs and researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have found that sometimes statements at NGOs central headquarters contradict those given by local staff. This prevents informative knowledge sharing and debate on the subject needed to improve NGO decisions regarding this issue, though there have been some notable exceptions; namely, the Afghanistan NGO Security Office and the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq.

The private security contractor fulfills many different needs in the private and public sectors. While some nations rely heavily on the input of governments of such nations as the United States, other countries do not trust the US, so they tend to look for private contractors who will have a fiduciary obligation to them.

====ISO for PMSC (2012)====
In 2012, were published the ISO/PAS 28007:2012 Guidelines for Private Maritime Security Companies.

==Activities elsewhere==

===Afghanistan===
* In December 2009, the Congressional Research Service, which provides background information to members of the United States Congress, announced that the deployment of 30,000 extra US troops into Afghanistan could be accompanied by a surge of &quot;26,000 to 56,000&quot; contractors. This would expand the presence of personnel from the US private sector in Afghanistan &quot;to anywhere from 130,000 to 160,000.&quot; The CRS study said that contractors made up 69 percent of the Pentagon&#x27;s personnel in Afghanistan in December 2008, a proportion that &quot;apparently represented the highest recorded percentage of contractors used by the Defense Department in any conflict in the history of the United States.&quot; In September 2008, their presence had dropped to 62 percent, and the US military troop strength increased modestly.
* Also in December 2009, a US House of Representatives oversight subcommittee stated that it had begun a wide-ranging investigation into allegations that American private security companies that were hired to protect Defense Department convoys in Afghanistan would be paying off warlords and the Taliban to ensure safe passage. That would mean that the United States unintentionally and indirectly engaged in a protection racket and might be indirectly funding the very insurgents it is trying to fight. A preliminary inquiry determined that the allegations warranted a deeper inquiry and focused initially on eight trucking companies that share a $2.2 billion Defense Department contract to carry goods and material from main supply points inside Afghanistan (primarily Bagram air base) to more than 100 forward operating bases and other military facilities in the country.

===Africa===

* In 1994 and 1995, the South African-based PMC Executive Outcomes was involved in two military actions in Africa. In the first conflict, Executive Outcomes fought on behalf of the Angolan government against UNITA after a UN-brokered peace settlement broke down. In the second action, Executive Outcomes was tasked with containing a guerrilla movement in Sierra Leone, the Revolutionary United Front. Both missions involved personnel from the firm training four to five thousand combat personnel for the Angolan government and retaking control of the diamond fields and forming a negotiated peace in Sierra Leone.
* In 2000, ABC Television&#x27;s international affairs program &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; broadcast a special report, &quot;Sierra Leone: Soldiers of Fortune&quot;, focusing on the exploits of South African pilot Neall Ellis and his Mi-24 Hind gunship. The report also investigated the failures of the UN Peacekeeping Force and the involvement of mercenaries/private military contractors in providing vital support to UN operations and British military Special Operations in Sierra Leone in 1999–2000.
* In mid-May 2006, police in the Democratic Republic of the Congo arrested 32 alleged mercenaries of different nationalities: 19 from South Africa, 10 from Nigeria and three from the United States. Half of them worked for the South African company Omega Security Solutions, and the Americans worked for AQMI Strategy Corp. The men were accused of plotting to overthrow the government, but charges were not pressed. The men were deported to their home countries.
* Due to strain of United States Armed Forces, the US State Department and The Pentagon have also outsourced the expanded military training in Africa to three companies: Military Professional Resources Inc., DFI International, and Logicon (now owned by Northrop Grumman).
* In 2015, STTEP International, (Specialised Tasks, Training, Equipment &amp; Protection) was credited with providing support to the Nigerian military that has proved decisive in containing Boko Haram activities in Nigeria. The chairman of STTEP, Eeben Barlow, is the former CEO and founder of Executive Outcomes.
* The Central African-based park ranger organization African Wildlife Defence Force contracts former servicemen and law enforcement personnel to protect national parks and private game ranches in Africa. Candidates must undergo additional retraining to become park rangers. They are also referred to as Private Ranger Contractors or PRC.
* According to the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), since 2017, the Russian-based PMC, Wagner Group, has been operating continuously in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, as well as in other African countries. Under the guise of helping governments defeat violent insurgencies or fight Islamic extremist movements, the Russian Wagner Group is believed by several US and African government sources to be responsible for significant crimes against humanity. It is reported that hundreds of contractors from the Russian PMC enter these countries each year. The Wagner Group has been accused of extreme violence against African civilians and human rights violations by the US State Department and most European governments.
* In the mid-2000s, a group of self-proclaimed former ANC freedom fighters, known as the TRAKboys, began to emerge in fringe political circles within Johannesburg and Cape Town. They gained national attention in South Africa when they began calling upon leaders to demand an investigation by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development into the foreign and domestic activities of Executive Outcomes. Failed assassination attempts on several high-profile members of the TRAKboys, such as former Cape Town-based manufacturing tycoon, Dylan4K, have led to speculation, conspiracy theories and public outrage directed towards Apartheid-era, Afrikaner-owned PMCs operating in southern Africa.

===Balkans===
* In 1995, both Croatia and Bosnia hired Military Professional Resources Inc. (MPRI) to equip, train, and professionalize their armed forces.
* In 1999, an incident involving DynCorp in Bosnia was followed by a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) lawsuit being filed against DynCorp employees stationed in Bosnia. It alleged that &quot;employees and supervisors from DynCorp were engaging in perverse, illegal and inhumane behavior and were illegally purchasing women, weapons, forged passports and participating in other immoral acts.&quot;

===Iraq===
In December 2006, there were estimated to be at least 100,000 contractors working directly for the United States Department of Defense in Iraq which was a tenfold increase in the use of private contractors for military operations since the Persian Gulf War, just over a decade earlier. The prevalence of PMCs led to the foundation of trade group the Private Security Company Association of Iraq. In Iraq, the issue of accountability, especially in the case of contractors carrying weapons, was a sensitive one. Iraqi laws do not hold over contractors.

On 5 December 2005, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld justified the use of PMCs in Iraq on the basis that they were cost effective and useful on the ground. He also affirmed that they were not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Two days before he left Iraq, L. Paul Bremer signed &quot;Order 17&quot; giving all Americans associated with the CPA and the American government immunity from Iraqi law. A July 2007 report from the American Congressional Research Service indicates that the Iraqi government still had no authority over private security firms contracted by the US government.

In 2007, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was amended to allow for prosecution of military contractors who are deployed in a &quot;declared war or a contingency operation.&quot;

After the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, the US State Department is reportedly planning to more than double the number of its private security guards, up to as many as 7,000. Defending five fortified compounds across the country, the security contractors would operate radars to warn of enemy rocket attacks, search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones and even staff quick reaction forces to aid civilians in distress. Its helicopter fleet, which will be piloted by contractors, will grow from 17 to 29.

PMCs supplied support to US military bases throughout the Persian Gulf, from operating mess halls to providing security. They supplied armed guards at a US Army base in Qatar, and they used live ammunition to train soldiers at Camp Doha in Kuwait. They maintained an array of weapons systems vital to the invasion of Iraq. They also provided bodyguards for VIPs, guard installations, and escort supply convoys from Kuwait. All these resources were called upon constantly.

In 2010, several Blackwater PMC employees &quot;were indicted on unlawful killing charges in connection with their work as US government contractors during the Iraq War&quot;; founder Erik Prince sold the company and departed soon thereafter.

====List of defective occurrences====
# Employees of private military company CACI and Titan Corp. were involved in the Iraq Abu Ghraib prison scandal in 2003, and 2004. The US Army &quot;found that contractors were involved in 36 percent of the [Abu Ghraib] proven incidents and identified 6 employees as individually culpable&quot;, although none have faced prosecution unlike US military personnel.
# On March 31, 2004, four American private contractors belonging to the company Blackwater USA were killed by insurgents in Fallujah as they drove through the town. They were dragged from their car in one of the most violent attacks on US contractors in the conflict. Following the attack, an angry mob mutilated and burned the bodies, dragging them through the streets before they were hung on a bridge. (&quot;See also&quot;: 31 March 2004 Fallujah ambush, Operation Vigilant Resolve)
# On March 28, 2005, 16 American contractors and three Iraqi aides from Zapata Engineering, under contract to the US Army Corps of Engineers to manage an ammunition storage depot, were detained following two incidents in which they allegedly fired upon US Marine checkpoint. While later released, the contractors have levied complaints of mistreatment against the Marines who detained them.
# On June 5, 2005, Colonel Theodore S. Westhusing committed suicide, after writing a report exonerating US Investigations Services of allegations of fraud, waste and abuse he received in an anonymous letter in May.
# On October 27, 2005, a &quot;trophy&quot; video, complete with post-production Elvis Presley music, appearing to show private military contractors in Baghdad shooting Iraqi civilians sparked two investigations after it was posted on the Internet. The video has been linked unofficially to Aegis Defence Services. According to the posters, the man who is seen shooting vehicles on this video in Iraq was a South African employee of Aegis Victory team named Danny Heydenreycher. He served in the British military for six years. After the incident, the regional director for Victory ROC tried to fire Heydenreycher, but the team threatened to resign if he did. Aegis, the US Army, and the US State Department each conducted a formal inquiry into the issue. The Army determined that there was no &quot;probable cause to believe that a crime was committed.&quot;
# On September 17, 2007, the Iraqi government announced that it was revoking the license of the American security firm Blackwater USA over the firm&#x27;s involvement in the deaths of seventeen Iraqis in a firefight that followed a car bomb explosion near a State Department motorcade. The company was allowed to continue to operate in Iraq until January 2009 when the US–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement took effect. Blackwater was one of the most high-profile firms operating in Iraq, with around 1,000 employees as well as a fleet of helicopters in the country. In 2014, four Blackwater employees were tried and convicted in US federal court over the incident; one of murder, and the other three of manslaughter and firearms charges. 
# On March 12, 2017, Sallyport Global fired two investigators who alleged sex trafficking, alcohol smuggling, and security lapses by Sallyport employees at Balad Air Base in Iraq.

===Middle East===
* On March 27, 2006, J. Cofer Black, the vice chairman of Blackwater USA, announced to attendees of a special operations exhibition in Jordan that his company could now provide a brigade-size force for low-intensity conflicts. According to Black, &quot;There is clear potential to conduct security operations at a fraction of the cost of NATO operations.&quot; Those comments were later denied. In March 2024, &quot;Intelligence Online&quot; reported that an ad was being circulated by former French special forces soldiers for around 3000–4000 foreign recruits. The ad was backed by Abu Dhabi-based Manar Military Company (MMC), which is run by a former French special forces officer, and is financially linked to a politically influential and wealthy Abu Dhabi family. The ad suggested that the UAE aimed to establish an elite foreign legion. Despite MMC claiming that the project was canceled and the ad was disinformation, experts said an Emirati foreign legion could be real. Since 2009, the UAE had been utilizing PMSCs, initially with Erik Prince. Investigations also revealed the UAE&#x27;s involvement in hiring mercenaries for assassinations in Yemen and for supporting the Wagner Group.

===Latin America===
* In 2006, a US congressional report listed a number of PMCs and other enterprises that have signed contracts to carry out anti-narcotics operations and related activities as part of Plan Colombia. DynCorp was among those contracted by the State Department, and others signed contracts with the Defense Department. Other companies from different countries, including Israel, have also signed contracts with the Colombian Defense Ministry to carry out security or military activities.

===Ukraine===
The Russian Wagner Group has been deployed in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, fighting alongside the Russian Armed Forces since early 2022. In February 2023 it was reported that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree which allowed Gazprom to launch &quot;a mercenary army&quot;. Several other mercenary groups have been in evidence, such as Redut, the ministerial-affiliated Patriot group, as well as dozens of other formations. According to one Dutch study, it was estimated that no more than approximately 35,000 operators of private military and security companies ever participated in combat in the Russo-Ukrainian War as of 2024.

===Yemen===
* Since 2015, the United Arab Emirates hired an estimated 1,800 Latin American contractors and 400 Eritrean troops for training and combat to support the Yemeni government&#x27;s efforts against the Houthi rebels during the Yemeni Civil War.

===China===
* Contractors from the Hong Kong-incorporated Frontier Services Group (FSG) like Erik Prince have established close ties with Chinese state-owned firms since 2014 by providing security, logistics, and aviation for Chinese companies in dozens of countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe in connection with China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative.
* In November 2018, FSG or its founder, incorporated a subsidiary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with &quot;a mandate to extract minerals and timber and conduct financial operations.&quot;
* FSG is favoured by CITIC, as of 2019 China&#x27;s premier state-owned enterprise, with one of the largest pools of foreign assets in the world.
*In February 2019, FSG signed a preliminary deal with the Chinese government to establish a training base in Kashgar, Xinjiang.

===Russia===
The Constitution of the Russian Federation was adopted by national referendum on 12 December 1993, and entered into force on 25 December 1993. Article 13.5 reads: &quot;The establishment and activities of public associations whose goals and activities are aimed at the forcible changing of the basis of the constitutional order and at violating the integrity of the Russian Federation, at undermining its security, at creating armed units, and at instigating social, racial, national and religious strife shall be prohibited.&quot; In addition, it has been illegal since at least the 1996 edition under Article 359 of the Russian criminal code to recruit, train or finance a mercenary. Also the use of him in an armed conflict or hostilities shall be punished.

Eeben Barlow apparently brought the idea of PMCs to Russia in 2010; there he gave an invited talk to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, as well as presented the PMC concept to representatives of the General Staff of the AFRF. At the time he proposed forming PMCs from retired military personnel and contractors.

The existence of Russian PMCs seems to go as far back as 2011, when the Syrian Civil War kicked off and violent unrest was felt in Libya before Muammar Gaddafi was eliminated in October. Russians had big investments in both of these countries. State-owned enterprise Rostec and its subsidiaries Rosboronexport and Technopromexport, as well as privately owned StroyTransGaz (STG) and Tatneft have billions of dollars invested in international affairs and like to hire from the Russian PMC sector.

In 2012, Vladimir Putin suggested to the State Duma to consider the legalization of PMCs, although owners of Russian PMCs have claimed that because Russia inherited its legal system from the Byzantine Empire, anything that is not explicitly prohibited is allowed.

The Syrian gains of ISIS in 2012 caused the Russian contingent to hire PMCs from the Moran Security Group (MSG) headed by Alexey Badikov, Slavonic Corps, Patriot PMC and Vega PMC. The MSG crew aboard the &quot;Myre Seadiver&quot; was arrested in October 2012 while in Nigeria.

Oleg Krinitsyn heads the RSB-Group, reportedly in 2013 Russia&#x27;s largest PMC. The Moscovite MSG was the focus of attention in 2013 for its failed and bloody Syrian involvement. It contracted employees through the Slavonic Corps shell company owned by Vadim Gusev and based in Hong Kong to work for the régime of Bashar al-Assad, but the latter failed &quot;to fulfill their financial obligations, which caused problems with the housing and feeding of the fighters from Slavonic Corps.&quot; Meanwhile, 100 of the 267 men hired in spring 2013 by Slavonic Corps perished in October 2013 in a firefight with ISIS. Out of the ashes of the Slavonic Corps was born the Wagner Group.

Two recruiters for the Slavonic Corps were ultimately jailed in October 2014 for their violation of Article 359. They faced up to eight years imprisonment but were convicted for three. Regular squad members were reportedly unpaid and faced no prosecution in Russia.

Not long after the Slavonic Corps fiasco, the Wagner Group PMC made its appearance on the scene. Near the end of 2014, Wagner was given the instructional role of local Basharite militias. Prior to September 2015, the PMCs were Russia&#x27;s only pseudo-military presence in Syria.

Wagner and Moran both contributed in 2014 to the Russian War in Donbas; Wagner is known to have fought in Syria since late 2015. One manner of payment to the group is from 25% of the proceeds from captured and secured oil and gas infrastructure in Syria.

In January 2018, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said of PMC employees that legislation was needed to &quot;protect these people&quot;, while Duma member Mikhail Yemelyanov authored a bill to do just that &quot;because private military companies are legal in many countries&quot;; continuing: &quot;We wrote in the bill that the defence ministry would coordinate and that participation in armed conflicts would only be with their permission.&quot;

In February 2023, it was reported that Gazprom would form a PMC of its own called Fakel. The law &quot;On the Security of Fuel and Energy Facilities&quot; appears now to state that companies in this field &quot;may be granted the right to establish a private security organisation&quot;.

The organisation Molfar has investigated 37 private military companies in Russia, and found that all of them are or have been connected to Kremlin. Most of them are also funded by Kremlin. More than half of them are participating in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In total, they have activities in 34 different countries.

===Fatalities===
By the end of 2012, the number of contractors who had died in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait had reached 3,000. 
Scholars have studied whether contractor deaths have an effect on the public&#x27;s &quot;casualty sensitivity&quot; when substituted for military fatalities. Casualty sensitivity refers to the inverse relationship between military deaths and public support for a sustained military engagement. Contractor deaths may account for nearly 30% of total US battlefield losses since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

===UN mercenary report===

In October 2007, the United Nations released a two-year study that reported that, although hired as &quot;security guards&quot;, private contractors performed military duties. A spokesman for the American mission to the UN office in Geneva (UNOG) said that &quot;Accusations that US government-contracted security guards, of whatever nationality, are mercenaries is inaccurate.&quot; An observer noted that the difficulty in separating private from public troops means that legal proceedings against these violent non-state actors can be complicated, and stated that contracted combatants carry the legitimacy of the state that hires them.

Demands for specific PSC services have grown to record levels in recent decades, and private firms&#x27; capabilities now include an array of services that are vital to the success of on-the-ground war fighting as well as other more traditional stability operations and contingency contracting. While past calls for corporate responsibility have heralded successes such as the Kimberley Process and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in widespread international operations, there has also been a move within the PSC and contingency contracting industries to call for accountability and to implement a code of ethics for the retention of services and operations of such service providers. Existing credible accountability initiatives form a skeleton for governing the conduct of contractors, but much remains to be fleshed out to form a coherent and standardized framework from which to oversee such organizations and activities. Over the last decade there have been a number of initiatives to regulate the private security industry. These include the ISO/PAS 28007:2012 Guidelines for Private Maritime Security Companies and the ANSI/ASIS PSC.1 and PSC.4 standards.

=== ASIS Commission on Standards ===
Founded in 1955, American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) is a society of individual security professionals dedicated to increasing the effectiveness and productivity of security professionals by developing educational programs and materials. ASIS is an ANSI-accredited Standards Developing Organization, and within ASIS, the ASIS Commission on Standards and Guidelines works with national and international standards-setting organizations and industry representatives to develop voluntary standards and guidelines for security professionals. With funding from the US Department of Defense, the ASIS Commission on Standards is currently promulgating four sets of standards for private security companies.

<text>KBR, Inc. (formerly Kellogg Brown &amp; Root) is a U.S. based company operating in fields of science, technology and engineering.

KBR works in various markets including aerospace, defense, industrial and intelligence. After Halliburton acquired Dresser Industries, KBR was created in 1998 when M.W. Kellogg merged with Halliburton&#x27;s construction subsidiary, Brown &amp; Root, to form Kellogg Brown &amp; Root. In 2006, the company separated from Halliburton and completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The company&#x27;s corporate offices are in the KBR Tower in downtown Houston.

==History==
===M. W. Kellogg===
In 1901, Morris Woodruff Kellogg founded The M. W. Kellogg Company in New York City. The company was incorporated in 1905 and its headquarters was moved to Jersey City, New Jersey. Initially Kellogg&#x27;s main business was power plant construction and fabrication of power plant components, but the development of hammer forge welding techniques helped ready the company to move into refining as the petroleum industry developed. Kellogg was announced the number one construction company for years 1993 to 1995. This is mainly due to their work in the Dulles Greenway.

Kellogg&#x27;s entry into process engineering initially focused on the Fleming cracking process, but in the 1920s Kellogg partnered with The Texas Company (Texaco) and Standard Oil of Indiana to purchase the Cross thermal cracking process. Kellogg set up one of the first petroleum laboratories in the country in 1926 to commercialize and then license the technology. This led to Kellogg building some 130 units in the United States and abroad.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Kellogg worked with leading refiners on various technologies. For the war effort, these developments led to the construction of six hydroreformer units, twenty fluid catalytic cracking units, and the only complete refinery built during World War II. Even bigger than the refining work was K-25, the gaseous diffusion plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, developed by Kellogg subsidiary the Kellex Corporation, built as part of the Manhattan Project. This period also included the development of the Benedict–Webb–Rubin (BWR) equation of state which has since become an industry mainstay and provided the basis for Kellogg&#x27;s lead in cryogenics.

The 1950s Kellogg technology expanded into steam pyrolysis, Orthoflow fluid catalytic cracking, phenol-from-cumene and coal-to-synthetic fuels technologies and the 1960s saw the growth in helium recovery, ethylene, and the development of Kellogg&#x27;s ammonia process. Kellogg maintained New York offices at 225 Broadway in the Transportation Building until 1956 when it moved to 711 Third Avenue in Midtown.

In 1970, Kellogg moved from New York City to Houston, Texas, and in 1975, they completed the move by relocating the research and development lab. The 1970s saw Kellogg become the first American contractor to receive contracts from China. Kellogg&#x27;s international work expanded with the major ammonia complexes in China, Indonesia, and Mexico as well as LNG liquefaction plant in Algeria and two receiving terminals in the United States, the world&#x27;s largest LPG plant in Kuwait and four fluid catalytic cracking units in Mexico. The 1980s saw continuation of global activity in LNG and ethylene with millisecond furnaces starting up in the United States.

Kellogg underwent numerous acquisitions and name changes through until 1987, when it was acquired by Dresser Industries, a provider of integrated services and project management for the oil and gas industry. Ten years later, Halliburton acquired Dresser, and combined Kellogg with Brown &amp; Root to create a new, larger subsidiary – Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR).

===Brown &amp; Root===
Brown &amp; Root was founded in Texas in 1919 by Herman Brown and Daniel Root, with money provided by Root (Brown&#x27;s brother in law). Root soon died and Herman Brown&#x27;s younger brother, George R. Brown, joined the company in 1922 (according to Robert A. Caro&#x27;s &quot;The Path to Power&quot;). The company began its operations by building roads in Texas.

One of its first large-scale projects, according to the book &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot;, was building a dam on the Texas Colorado River near Austin during the Depression years. For assistance in federal payments, the company turned to the local Congressman, Lyndon Johnson. Brown &amp; Root was the principal source of campaign funds after Johnson&#x27;s initial run for Congress in 1937, in return for persuading the Bureau of Reclamation to change its rules against paying for a dam on land the federal government did not own, a decision that had to go all the way to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. After other very profitable construction projects for the federal government, Brown &amp; Root gave massive sums of cash for Johnson&#x27;s first run for the U.S. Senate in 1941.

During World War II, Brown &amp; Root built the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and its subsidiary Brown Shipbuilding produced a series of warships for the U.S. government. In 1947 Brown &amp; Root built one of the world&#x27;s first offshore oil platforms.

According to Tracy Kidder&#x27;s book &quot;Mountains Beyond Mountains&quot;, Brown &amp; Root was a contractor in the Péligre Dam project. The project was designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and financed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

===Halliburton years===
Following the death of Herman Brown, Halliburton Energy Services acquired Brown &amp; Root in December 1962. According to Dan Briody, who wrote a book on the subject, the company became part of a consortium called RMK-BRJ that built about 85 percent of the infrastructure needed by the U.S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War. In 1967, the Government Accounting Office alleged that Brown &amp; Root had been unaccountable with public funds and allowed materials to be stolen. Donald Rumsfeld expressed concern that their contracts were not adequately audited. At this time, protesters derided Brown &amp; Root as a symbol of war profiteering, dubbing the company &quot;Burn &amp; Loot&quot;.

In 1989, Halliburton acquired another major engineering and construction contractor, C. F. Braun Inc., of Alhambra California, and merged it into Brown &amp; Root. From 1995 to 2002, Halliburton KBR was awarded at least $2.5 billion to construct and run military bases, some in secret locations, as part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP).

In September 2005, under a competitive bid contract it won in July 2005 to provide debris removal and other emergency work associated with natural disasters, KBR started assessment of the cleanup and reconstruction of Gulf Coast Marine and Navy facilities damaged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The facilities include: Naval Station Pascagoula, Naval Station Gulfport, the John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, two smaller U.S. Navy facilities in New Orleans, Louisiana, and others in the Gulf Coast region.

===Formation of KBR, Inc.===
Halliburton announced on April 5, 2007, that it had separated from KBR, which had been its contracting, engineering, and construction unit as a part of the company for 44 years. The move was prefaced by a statement registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on April 15, 2006, stating that Halliburton planned to sell up to 20 percent of its KBR stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). On November 16, 2006, KBR shares were offered for the public in an initial public offering with shares priced at $17. The shares closed up more than 22 percent to $20.75 a share on the first trading day.

On May 7, 2008, the company announced that it would acquire Birmingham, Alabama-based engineering and construction firm BE&amp;K for $550 million.

The company announced on November 7, 2017, that KBR secured a contract to provide astronaut medical support services for the European Space Agency&#x27;s European Astronaut Center Space Medicine Office in Cologne, Germany.

In May 2019, the company introduced new branding.

In October 2021, KBR purchased UK and Australian systems, engineering and technology company Frazer-Nash Consultancy from Babcock International Group for a reported £293 million.

==Operations==
The company is heavily involved in mission support for several government agencies, including NASA, providing training and care for American astronauts.

===GICS Code Reclassification===
In April 2019, KBR&#x27;s GICS code was reclassified as an IT consulting company by stock traders. MSCI, a New York firm that manages how companies are classified on various stock exchanges, reclassified KBR as a company specializing in &quot;IT Consulting &amp; Other Services.&quot; KBR has made shift away from engineering and construction projects to government contracts that include information technology and other support services. KBR&#x27;s government services sector accounted for more than 70 percent of the company&#x27;s $4.9 billion revenue in 2018.

===Expansion===
In February 2018, KBR announced that it would acquire Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies, a provider of technological solutions as well as mission operations in the aerospace sector, for $355 million. The acquisition was completed April 25, 2018.

In October 2020, KBR announced it had completed the acquisition of Centauri, LLC, a leading independent provider of space, directed energy, and other advanced technology solutions to the United States intelligence community and Department of Defense, from Arlington Capital Partners.

KBR completed the acquisition of LinQuest Corporation for $737M in September 2024. LinQuest was a provider of advanced engineering, data analytics and digital integration services.

===Office facilities===
In 2008, the firm announced that a new office facility would appear at the intersection of the Grand Parkway and Interstate 10 in unincorporated western Harris County, Texas, between Houston and Katy. The new complex would have been in close proximity to the Energy Corridor area of Houston. KBR planned to continue to have a corporate presence in Downtown Houston. In December KBR said that it would not continue with the plans due to a weakened economy.

In January 2010 KBR announced plans to extend its lease and expand its presence in Downtown Houston. The downtown expansion replaced the Harris County plans. The new total of KBR leased space in downtown will be just over at completion.

===Kosovo===
In 1996, Brown &amp; Root was awarded a contract to support U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troops as part of the SFOR operation in the Balkan region. This contract was extended to also include KFOR operations in Kosovo starting in 1999. Camp Bondsteel in Ferizaj, Kosovo, was constructed by the 94th Engineer Construction Battalion together with the private Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR) under the direction of the Army Corps of Engineers.

===Afghanistan===
KBR was awarded a $100 million contract in 2002 to build a new U.S. embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, from the U.S. State Department. KBR has also been awarded 15 Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) task orders worth more than $216 million for work under Operation Enduring Freedom, the military name for operations in Afghanistan. These include establishing base camps at Kandahar and Bagram Air Base and training foreign troops from the Republic of Georgia.

===Cuba===
KBR has also been actively involved in the development of works in Cuba. Most notably sections of the U.S. Naval base in Guantanamo, completed in 2006. Camp 6, the newest facility built for detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, is designed after a maximum-security penitentiary in the U.S.

===Iraq===
In the 2000s, KBR employed more American private contractors and had a larger contract with the U.S. government than any other firm in Iraq. The company&#x27;s roughly 14,000 U.S. employees in Iraq provide logistical support to the U.S. military. Some U.S. Marines revived the Vietnam-era nickname &#x27;Burn &amp; Loot&#x27; as a name for the company during the Iraq War.

In November 2012, a dozen Oregon National Guard soldiers sued KBR for knowingly exposing them to hexavalent chromium, and were awarded more than $85 million; the soldiers were providing security to civilian workers at the Qarmat Ali water facility in 2003.

In January 2019, a case brought against KBR by hundreds of veterans, who claimed the company&#x27;s practice of burning trash near barracks had sickened them, was refused by the Supreme Court, which let stand a lower court&#x27;s ruling against the veterans.

===Space and work with NASA===
In 2021, NASA awarded KBR and Aerodyne Industries a $531 million contract for systems engineering at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight center in Maryland. KBR also houses the low pressure chamber designed to test the high altitude flying of the new X-59 research aircraft being designed by NASA.

Scientists and engineers working for KBR also contributed to the development and deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope, which launched in 2022, as part of various Mechanical Integration Services and Technology contracts.

== Lobbying ==
KBR engages third party lobbyists to represent the company in jurisdiction where they have business interests. For example, in South Australia, KBR is represented by lobbying firm MCM Strategic Communications.

==Controversy==
===Questionable charges===

In June 2008, Charles M. Smith, the senior civilian Defense Department official overseeing the government&#x27;s multibillion-dollar contract with KBR during the early stages of the war in Iraq said he was forced out of his job in 2004 for refusing to approve $1 billion in questionable charges by KBR. Smith refused to approve the payments because Army auditors determined that KBR lacked credible records to support more than $1 billion in spending. Smith stated, &quot;They had a gigantic amount of costs they couldn&#x27;t justify.&quot; He said that following this action he was suddenly dismissed and according to one &quot;New York Times&quot; source &quot;his successors — after taking the unusual step of hiring an outside contractor to consider KBR&#x27;s claims — approved most of the payments he had tried to block.&quot;

===Shell companies in Cayman Islands===
In March 2008, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that KBR had avoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring workers through shell companies based in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. More than 21,000 people working for KBR in Iraq – including about 10,500 Americans – are listed as employees of two companies, Service Employees International Inc., and Overseas Administrative Services, which exist on the island only in computer files in an office. KBR admitted that the companies were set up &quot;in order to allow us to reduce certain tax obligations of the company and its employees&quot;. But KBR does claim the workers as its own with regards to the legal immunity extended to employers working in Iraq.

===Bribing Nigerian officials===
On February 6, 2009, the Justice Department announced KBR had been charged with paying &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; in bribes to Nigerian officials in order to win government contracts, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). A 22-page document filed in a Houston federal court alleged massive bribes in connection with the construction of a natural gas plant on Bonny Island requiring $7.5bn USD. KBR officials had no comment. KBR pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay $402m USD in criminal fines, nearly all of which was covered by Halliburton. KBR and Halliburton also paid $177m USD in disgorgement of profits to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due a civil complaint filed by the SEC relating to the FCPA charges.

Former CEO Albert Jackson Stanley, who ran KBR when it was a subsidiary to Halliburton, was sentenced to 30 months in prison via plea agreement.

===Waxman allegations===
The Army&#x27;s actions came under fire from California Congressman Henry Waxman, who, along with Michigan Congressman John Dingell, asked the General Accounting Office to investigate whether the U.S. Agency for International Development and The Pentagon were circumventing government contracting procedures and favoring companies with ties to the Bush administration. They also accused KBR of inflating prices for importing gasoline into Iraq. In June 2003, the Army announced that it would replace KBR&#x27;s oil-infrastructure contract with two public-bid contracts worth a maximum total of $1 billion, to be awarded in October. However, the Army announced in October it would expand the contract ceiling to $2 billion and the solicitation period to December. As of October 16, 2003, KBR had performed nearly $1.6 billion worth of work. In the meantime, KBR has subcontracted with two companies to work on the project: Boots &amp; Coots, an oil field emergency response firm that Halliburton works in partnership with (CEO Jerry L. Winchester was a former Halliburton manager) and Wild Well Control. Both firms are based in Texas.

===Professional negligence===
KBR&#x27;s maintenance work in Iraq has been criticized after reports of soldiers electrocuted from faulty wiring. Specifically, KBR has been charged by the Army for improper installation of electrical units in bathrooms throughout U.S. bases. CNN reported that an Army Special Forces soldier, Staff Sergeant Ryan Maseth, died by electrocution in his shower stall on January 2, 2008. Army documents showed that KBR inspected the building and found serious electrical problems a full 11 months before his death. KBR noted &quot;several safety issues concerning the improper grounding of electrical devices&quot;. But KBR&#x27;s contract did not cover &quot;fixing potential hazards;&quot; It covered repairing items only after they broke down. Maseth&#x27;s family has sued KBR. In January 2009, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command investigator assigned to the case recommended that Maseth&#x27;s official cause of death should be changed from &quot;accidental&quot; to &quot;negligent homicide&quot;. KBR supervisors were blamed for failing to ensure electrical and plumbing work were performed by qualified employees, and for failure to inspect the work. In late January 2009, the Defense Contract Management Agency handed down a &quot;Level III Corrective Action Request&quot; to KBR. This is disseminated after a contractor is found being in a state of &quot;serious noncompliance&quot;, and is one step from suspending or terminating a contract. In 2011, KBR defended the lawsuit by claiming that Iraqi, not American, law should apply in determining a verdict. Despite these issues, KBR was awarded a $35 million contract for major electrical work in 2009.

===Employee safety in warzones===
As of June 9, 2008, 81 American and foreign KBR employees and subcontractors have been killed, and more than 380 have been wounded by hostile action while performing services under the company&#x27;s government contracts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. Family members of injured or killed employees have sued the company in relation to the 2004 Iraq KBR convoy ambush.

===Sexual assault and abuse allegations===

Jamie Leigh Jones testified at a Congressional hearing that she had been gang-raped by as many as seven coworkers in Iraq in 2005 when she was an employee of KBR (a subsidiary of Halliburton at the time), and then falsely imprisoned in a shipping container for 24 hours without food or drink.

Under questioning, Jones denied ever having claimed to have been gang-raped, even though her extensive media appearances say otherwise.

Jones and her lawyers said that 38 women have contacted her reporting similar experiences while working as contractors in Iraq, Kuwait, and other countries. On September 15, 2009, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Jones, in a 2–1 ruling, and found that her alleged injuries were not, in fact, in any way related to her employment and thus, not covered by the contract. On July 8, 2011, a jury in the Southern District of Texas federal court in Houston found against Jones and cleared KBR of any wrongdoing.

Jamie Leigh Jones&#x27;s case led Senator Al Franken to propose an amendment to the defense appropriations bill, which was passed in October 2009, to allow employees of firms with government contracts access to the courts. Jones&#x27;s case received an unfavorable verdict and her alleged fabrication caused a subsequent media scandal.

Mary Beth Kineston, an Ohio truck driver, alleged she was sexually harassed and groped by several KBR employees, and was later fired after reporting to the company the threats and harassment endured by female employees.

Jo Frederiksen, another female employee, filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly being &quot;inappropriately touched, stalked, intimidated and verbally harassed&quot; during her time with the firm in 2003. According to Frederiksen, after she complained to the firm she was moved to an even more hostile location while some of her abusers were promoted. The lawsuit claimed &quot;women are second-rate citizens provided for the pleasure of men&quot; at the firm. Frederiksen also alleged a lack of oversight to &quot;rampant illicit criminal behavior&quot; related to prostitution and human trafficking by other KBR employees.

===Human trafficking lawsuit===
On August 28, 2008, KBR and a Jordanian subcontractor were accused of human trafficking in a federal lawsuit filed in Los Angeles. The suit alleged that 13 Nepali men were recruited by Daoud &amp; Partners to work in hotels and restaurants in Jordan, but upon arrival all 13 men had their passports seized by the contractor and were sent to Iraq to work on the Al Asad Airbase. Twelve of the employees were abducted when their unprotected convoy was attacked by a group calling itself the Army of Ansar al-Sunna, while en route to the base. Shortly thereafter, a video was released of one of the men being beheaded and the other 11 shot. The remaining employee, Buddi Prasad Gurung, claims to have been held against his will for 15 months, during which time he was forced to work at the base. Reuters quoted attorney Matthew Handley as saying, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t appear that any of them knew they were going to Iraq.&quot; KBR made no public comment on the lawsuit, but released a statement which stated in part that it, &quot;in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior&quot;.

===&quot;Burn pits&quot; lawsuits===
More than 20 federal lawsuits naming KBR and seeking class-action status were filed in late 2008 and 2009 over the practice of operating &quot;burn pits&quot; at U.S. bases in both Iraq and Afghanistan and thus exposing soldiers to smoke containing dioxin, asbestos, and other harmful substances. The pits are said to include &quot;every type of waste imaginable&quot;, with items such as &quot;tires, lithium batteries, Styrofoam, paper, wood, rubber, petroleum-oil-lubricating products, metals, hydraulic fluids, munitions boxes, medical waste, biohazard materials (including human corpses), medical supplies (including those used during smallpox inoculations), paints, solvents, asbestos insulation, items containing pesticides, polyvinyl chloride pipes, animal carcasses, dangerous chemicals, and hundreds of thousands of plastic water bottles&quot;. A company statement responding to the allegations said that &quot;at the sites where KBR provides burn pit services, the company does so ... in accordance with the relevant provisions&quot; of its contracts as well as &quot;operational guidelines approved by the Army&quot;.

===Late payment===
In the UK in April 2019, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root was suspended from the UK Government&#x27;s Prompt Payment Code for failing to pay suppliers on time.

===Workers stranded in Indian Ocean territory=== 
On September 16, 2022, the Department of Migrant Workers Secretary, Susan Ople, confirmed a &quot;Washington Post&quot; report that 800 Filipino workers were stranded at a remote US military base on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean due to an employment dispute with KBR.

<text>Eva Renée Nele (born 1932) is a German artist who works principally in goldsmithing and metal sculpture.

== Life ==

Nele was born on 15 March 1932 in Berlin, the daughter of Arnold Bode; she grew up in Kassel. She studied under at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin and under Richard Hamilton at the Central School of Art and Design in London. She also studied at the Atelier Lacourière-Frélaut in Paris. She was a member of Situationist International until 1962. She lives in Frankfurt am Main.

From 1985 to 1990 she taught sculpture at the in Salzburg, Austria. She also taught at the Goethe-Universität of Frankfurt and – from 1993 – at the University of Giessen in Giessen, in Hesse.

== Work ==

Nele participated in &quot;Documenta II&quot;, organised by her father in 1959. 

Her sculpture &quot;The Couple&quot;, made in 1961, is in the collection of the Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen in Munich.

&quot;Die Rampe&quot;, a Holocaust memorial showing faceless cloaked figures descending on a ramp from a railway goods wagon or collapsed at the foot of it, was created in 1982, and was installed on the campus of the University of Kassel in 1985. It was destroyed by arson soon after, and restored in 1987. In 2017 it was moved to the Holländischer Platz campus of the university, much of which is built on land that was formerly the site of factories of the Henschel company, which during the Second World War made extensive use of forced labour. A work titled &quot;Windsbraut&quot; is in the Dalbergplatz in Frankfurt-Höchst. 

In 2008 she was, with the cellist , one of two recipients in that year of the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt.

<text>Rosalyn Tureck (December 14, 1913 – July 17, 2003) was an American pianist and harpsichordist who was particularly associated with the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. However, she had a wide-ranging repertoire that included works by composers Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms and Frédéric Chopin, as well as more modern composers such as David Diamond, Luigi Dallapiccola and William Schuman. Diamond&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 1 was inspired by Tureck&#x27;s playing. She was one of the greatest pianists of the 20th Century and she is also known as the High Priestess of Bach.

==Biography==
Tureck was born in Chicago, Illinois, the third of three daughters of Russian Jewish immigrants Samuel Tureck (né Turk; Rosalyn’s father was of Turkish descent) and Monya (Lipson) Tureck. She was the granddaughter of a cantor from Kiev. The first of her teachers to recognize her special gifts for playing the music of Bach was the Javanese-born Dutch pianist Jan Chiapusso, who gave her twice-weekly lessons in Chicago from 1929 to 1931 and also introduced her to the sounds of exotic instruments and ensembles such as the Javanese gamelan.

At Tuley High School (closed 1974), Tureck was a friend and classmate of future Nobel Prize–winning novelist Saul Bellow, who graduated in January 1932. The two remained in contact for decades.

&quot;My technique was grounded, from my earliest years of study, in the school of Mendelssohn as passed on by Anton Rubinstein and many of his pupils, one of whom, Sophia Brilliant-Liven, was my teacher. It&#x27;s essentially a finger technique, not a chordal one.&quot; Tureck reports that Brilliant-Liven was a stern teacher. &quot;During the years I was with her, from the ages of 9 to 13, she never praised my playing.&quot; However, she made up for this, Tureck said, with a single compliment given to 13-year old Tureck after her performance in the semi-finals of a piano competition in which 80,000 young pianists participated. Brilliant-Liven told young Tureck, &quot;If I had been listening from outside the auditorium, I would have sworn it was Anton Rubinstein himself playing.&quot; Tureck went on to the finals, and to win first prize in the competition.

She continued her musical studies in Chicago with pianist and harpsichordist Gavin Williamson. She later studied at the Juilliard School in New York City, where one of her teachers was Leon Theremin. She made her debut at Carnegie Hall playing the electronic instrument invented by Theremin, the eponymously named theremin. In 1940, Tureck joined the piano faculty of the Mannes School of Music. Later in her career, she joined the faculty at Juilliard as a teacher.

For a while she followed Wanda Landowska in playing Bach&#x27;s keyboard music on a harpsichord but later returned to playing the piano. In 1970, Tureck performed in Boston for the Peabody Mason Concert series. She was an honorary fellow of St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Author William F. Buckley, a friend of Tureck&#x27;s, when writing in his magazine &quot;National Review&quot; often called her &quot;J.S. Bach&#x27;s representative on Earth&quot;.

In a CBC radio special on Glenn Gould, the host told Tureck that Gould cited her as his &quot;only&quot; influence. She responded by stating that she was an influence and that it was very kind of him to say so.

On March 18, 1986, she played during the state diner hosted by President Ronald Reagan.

In 1990 she served on the jury of the Paloma O&#x27;Shea Santander International Piano Competition.

During 2000 and 2001, Tureck lived in Spain teaching and practicing every day of the week, specifically in Estepona, Málaga, where she remained for a year in retirement.

Tureck was among the founders of the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory in 1947.

She died in New York City in 2003, aged 89. Her scores and recordings were given to the Music Division and the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound, both divisions of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

<text>Golden World Records was an American record label owned by Eddie Wingate and Joanne Bratton (née Jackson, former wife of boxing champion Johnny Bratton). The recording studio was located in Detroit, Michigan, United States. The studio&#x27;s national hits included &quot;Oh How Happy&quot; by Shades of Blue and &quot;(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet&quot; by The Reflections. The early, pre-Motown songs of Edwin Starr, such as &quot;Agent Double-O-Soul&quot;, were recorded at the Golden World studio.

Golden World Records operated from 1962 to 1968.

The label and its subsidiaries were purchased by Berry Gordy in 1966 and folded into the Motown Record Corporation. The Golden World studio became Motown&#x27;s &quot;Studio B&quot;, working in support of the original Motown recording studio (Studio A) at Hitsville USA. Before its purchase by Gordy, the studio&#x27;s recordings often included moonlighting Motown back-up musicians, including James Jamerson on bass and George McGregor on percussion.

The famous clock that hung in Golden World Records is currently owned by Melodies and Memories in Eastpointe, Michigan, and is on display there. A restored old Steinway piano that Motown inherited from Golden World is now on display at the Motown Museum.

<text>A metro station or subway station is a train station for a rapid transit system, which as a whole is usually called a &quot;metro&quot; or &quot;subway&quot;. A station provides a means for passengers to purchase tickets, board trains, and evacuate the system in the case of an emergency. In the United Kingdom, they are known as underground stations, most commonly used in reference to the London Underground.

==Location==
The location of metro stations are carefully planned to provide easy access to important urban facilities such as roads, commercial centers, major buildings and other transport nodes.

Most stations are located underground, with entrances and exits leading up to ground or street level. The bulk of the station is typically positioned under land reserved for public thoroughfares or parks. Placing the station underground reduces the outside area occupied by the station, allowing vehicles and pedestrians to continue using the ground-level area in a similar way as before the station&#x27;s construction. This is especially important where the station is serving high-density urban precincts, where ground-level spaces are already heavily utilised.

In other cases, a station may be elevated above a road, or at ground level depending on the level of the train tracks. The physical, visual and economic impact of the station and its operations will be greater. Planners will often take metro lines or parts of lines at or above ground where urban density decreases, extending the system further for less cost. Metros are most commonly used in urban cities, with great populations. Alternatively, a preexisting railway land corridor is re-purposed for rapid transit.

==Facilities==

At street level the logo of the metro company marks the entrances/exits of the station. Usually, signage shows the name of the station and describes the facilities of the station and the system it serves. Often there are several entrances for one station, saving pedestrians from needing to cross a street and reducing crowding.

Metro stations typically provide ticket vending and ticket validating systems. The station is divided into an unpaid zone connected to the street, and a paid zone connected to the train platforms. The ticket barrier allows passengers with valid tickets to pass between these zones. The barrier may be operated by staff or more typically with automated turnstiles or gates that open when a transit pass is scanned or detected. Some metro systems dispense with paid zones and validate tickets with staff in the train carriages.

Access from the street to ticketing and the train platform is provided by stairs, concourses, escalators, elevators and tunnels. The station will be designed to minimise overcrowding and improve flow, sometimes by designating tunnels as one way. Permanent or temporary barriers may be used to manage crowds. Some metro stations have direct connections to important nearby buildings (see underground city).

Most jurisdictions mandate that people with disabilities must have unassisted use of the station. This is resolved with elevators, taking a number of people from street level to the unpaid ticketing area, and then from the paid area to the platform. In addition, there will be stringent requirements for emergencies, with backup lighting, emergency exits and alarm systems installed and maintained. Stations are a critical part of the evacuation route for passengers escaping from a disabled or troubled train.

A subway station may provide additional facilities, such as toilets, kiosks and amenities for staff and security services, such as Transit police.

==Transfer stations==
Some metro stations can also be interchanges, serving to connect and transfer passengers between lines or transport systems. The platforms may be multi-level. Transfer stations handle more passengers than regular stations, with additional connecting tunnels and larger concourses to reduce walking times and manage crowd flows.

==Platform-edge doors==
In some stations, especially where trains are fully automated, the entire platform is screened from the track by a wall, typically of glass, with automatic platform-edge doors (PEDs). These open, like elevator doors, only when a train is stopped, and thus eliminate the hazard that a passenger will accidentally fall (or deliberately jump) onto the tracks and be run over or electrocuted.

Control over ventilation of the platform is also improved, allowing it to be heated or cooled without having to do the same for the tunnels. The doors add cost and complexity to the system, and trains may have to approach the station more slowly so they can stop in accurate alignment with them.

==Architectural design==
Metro stations, more so than railway and bus stations, often have a characteristic artistic design that can identify each stop. Some have sculptures or frescoes. For example, London&#x27;s Baker Street station is adorned with tiles depicting Sherlock Holmes. The tunnel for Paris&#x27; Concorde station is decorated with tiles spelling the Déclaration des Droits de l&#x27;Homme et du Citoyen. Every metro station in Valencia, Spain has a different sculpture on the ticket-hall level. Alameda station is decorated with fragments of white tile, like the dominant style of the &quot;Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències&quot;. Each of the original four stations in the Olympic Green on Line 8 of the Beijing Subway are decorated in Olympic styles, while the downtown stations are decorated traditionally with elements of Chinese culture. On the Tyne and Wear Metro, the station at Newcastle United&#x27;s home ground St James&#x27; Park is decorated in the clubs famous black and white stripes. Each station of the Red Line and Purple Line subway in Los Angeles was built with different artwork and decorating schemes, such as murals, tile artwork and sculptural benches. Every station of the Mexico City Metro is prominently identified by a unique icon in addition to its name, because the city had high illiteracy rates at the time the system was designed.

Some metro systems, such as those of Naples, Stockholm, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tashkent, Kyiv, Montreal, Lisbon, Kaohsiung and Prague are famous for their beautiful architecture and public art. The Paris Métro is famous for its Art Nouveau station entrances; while the Athens Metro is known for its display of archeological relics found during construction. And the London Underground is famous for its oxblood red faïence blocks including pillars and semi-circular first-floor windows station buildings designed by Leslie Green.

However, it is not always the case that metro designers strive to make all stations artistically unique. Sir Norman Foster&#x27;s new system in Bilbao, Spain uses the same modern architecture at every station to make navigation easier for the passenger, though some may argue that this is at the expense of character.

Metro stations usually feature prominent poster and video advertising, especially at locations where people are waiting, producing an alternative revenue stream for the operator.

== Construction types ==
=== Shallow column station ===

The shallow column station is a type of construction of subway stations, with the distinguishing feature being an abundance of supplementary supports for the underground cavity. Most designs employ metal columns or concrete and steel columns arranged in lines parallel to the long axis of the station.

Stations can be double-span with a single row of columns, triple-span with two rows of columns, or multi-span. The typical shallow column station in Russia is triple-span, assembled from concrete and steel, and is from 102 to 164 metres in length with a column spacing of 4–6 m. Along with the typical stations, there are also specially built stations. For example, one of the spans may be replaced with a monolithic vault (as in the Moskovskaya station of the Samara Metro or Sibirskaya of the Novosibirsk Metro). In some cases, one of the rows of columns may be replaced with a load-bearing wall. Such a dual hall, one-span station, Kashirskaya, was constructed to provide a convenient cross-platform transfer. Recently, stations have appeared with monolithic concrete and steel instead of assembled pieces, as Ploshchad Tukaya in Kazan.

The typical shallow column station has two vestibules at both ends of the station, most often combined with below-street crossings.

For many metro systems outside Russia, the typical column station is a two-span station with metal columns, as in New York City, Berlin, and others. In Chicago, underground stations of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; are three-span stations if constructed with a centre platform.

In the Moscow Metro, approximately half of the stations are of shallow depth, built in the 1960s and 1970s, but in Saint Petersburg, because of the difficult soil conditions and dense building in the centre of the city this was impossible. The Saint Petersburg Metro has only five shallow-depth stations altogether, with three of them having the column design: Avtovo, Leninsky Prospekt, and Prospekt Veteranov. The first of these is less typical, as it is buried at a significant depth, and has only one surface vestibule.

=== Deep column station ===

A deep column station is a type of subway station consisting of a central hall with two side halls connected by ring-like passages between a row of columns. Depending on the type of station, the rings transmit load to the columns either by &quot;wedged arches&quot; or through Purlins, forming a &quot;column-purlin complex&quot;.

The fundamental advantage of the column station is the significantly greater connection between the halls, compared with a pylon station.

The first deep column station in the world is Mayakovskaya, opened in 1938 in Moscow.

One variety of column station is the &quot;column-wall station&quot;. In such stations, some of the spaces between the columns are replaced with walls. In this way, the resistance to earth pressure is improved in difficult ground environments. Examples of such stations in Moscow are Krestyanskaya Zastava and Dubrovka. In Saint Petersburg, Komendantsky Prospekt is an example.

=== Pylon station ===

The pylon station is a type of deep underground subway station. The basic distinguishing characteristic of the pylon station is the manner of division of the central hall from the station tunnels

The pylon station consists of three separate halls, separated from each other by a row of pylons with passages between them. The independence of the halls allows the architectural form of the central and side halls to be differentiated. This is especially characteristic in the non-metro Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station, constructed as a pylon station due to its 80-meter depth, where the platform halls are built to superficially resemble an outdoor train station.

Building stations of the pylon type is preferable in difficult geological situations, as such a station is better able to oppose earth pressure. However, the limited number of narrow passages limits the throughput between the halls.

The pylon station was the earliest type of deep underground station. One variation is the so-called London-style station. In such stations the central hall is reduced to the size of an anteroom, leading to the inclined walkway or elevators. In some cases the anteroom is also the base of the escalators. In the countries of the former USSR there is currently only one such station: Arsenalna in Kyiv. In Jerusalem, two planned underground heavy rail stations, Jerusalem–Central and Jerusalem–Khan, will be built this way. In Moscow, there were such stations, but they have since been rebuilt: Lubyanka and Chistiye Prudy are now ordinary pylon stations, and Paveletskaya-Radialnaya is now a column station.

In the Moscow Metro, typical pylon station are Kievskaya-Koltsevaya, Smolenskaya of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line, Oktyabrskaya-Koltsevaya, and others.

In the Saint Petersburg Metro, pylon stations include Ploshchad Lenina, Pushkinskaya, Narvskaya, Gorkovskaya, Moskovskie Vorota, and others.

=== Single-vault station ===

The construction of a single-vault station consists of a single wide and high underground hall, in which there is only one vault (hence the name). The first single-vault stations were built in Leningrad in 1975: Politekhnicheskaya and Ploshchad Muzhestva. Not long after, the first two-level single-vault transfer stations were opened in Washington DC in 1976: L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, Metro Center and Gallery Place.

In the Moscow Metro there is only one deep underground single-vault station, Timiryazevskaya, in addition to several single-vault stations at shallow depth. In the Nizhny Novgorod Metro there are four such stations: Park Kultury, Leninskaya, Chkalovskaya and Kanavinskaya. In the Saint Petersburg Metro all single-vault stations are deep underground, for example Ozerki, Chornaya Rechka, Obukhovo, Chkalovskaya, and others. Most of the underground stations of the Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Metro system are single-vault designs, as are all the single-line vaulted stations in the Montreal Metro. In Prague Metro, there are two underground stations built as single-vault, Kobylisy and Petřiny. In the Bucharest Metro, Titan station is built in this method.

=== Cavern station ===


The cavern station is a metro station built directly inside a cavern. Many stations of the Stockholm Metro, especially on the Blue line, were built in man-made caverns; instead of being enclosed in a tunnel, these stations are built to expose the bedrock in which they are excavated. The Stockholm Metro also has a depot facility built in a cavern system.

In the Hong Kong MTR, examples of stations built into caverns include Tai Koo station on Hong Kong Island, Other examples in the city include Sai Wan Ho, Sai Ying Pun, Hong Kong University and Lei Tung stations.

<text>A national security council (NSC) is usually an executive branch governmental body responsible for coordinating policy on national security issues and advising chief executives on matters related to national security. An NSC is often headed by a national security advisor and staffed with senior-level officials from military, diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and other governmental bodies. The functions and responsibilities of an NSC at the strategic state level are different from those of the United Nations Security Council, which is more of a diplomatic forum.

Occasionally a nation will be ruled by a similarly named body, such as &quot;the National Security Committee&quot; or &quot;Council for National Security&quot;. These bodies are often a result of the establishment or preservation of a military dictatorship (or some other national crisis), do not always have statutory approval, and are usually intended to have transitory or provisional powers. See also: coup d&#x27;état.

Some nations may have a similar body which is not formally part of the executive government. For example, the National Security Commission in China is an organ of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the sole ruling party, and headed by the CCP general secretary, rather than an organ of the executive government.

<doc id="274283" wikidata="Q469992" url="?curid=274283" title="American avocet">
<text>The American avocet (Recurvirostra americana) is a large wader in the avocet and stilt family, Recurvirostridae, found in North America. It spends much of its time foraging in shallow water or on mud flats, often sweeping its bill from side to side in water as it seeks crustacean and insect prey.

== Taxonomy==
The American avocet was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the pied avocet in the genus &quot;Recurvirostra&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Recurvirostra americana&quot;. Gmelin based his description on that by the English ornithologist John Latham who in 1785 had described and illustrated the American avocet in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham cited the earlier publication by William Dampier and also that by Thomas Pennant. The genus name combines the Latin meaning &#x27;bent&#x27; or &#x27;curved backwards&#x27; with meaning &#x27;bill&#x27;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The American avocet is a member of the order Charadriiformes, which includes shorebirds, gulls, and alcids. Its family, Recurvirostridae, includes stilts and avocets. The genus &quot;Recurvirostra&quot; includes three other species: the Andean avocet, the pied avocet, and the red-necked avocet.

==Description==
The American avocet measures in length, has a wingspan of and weighs The bill is black, pointed, and curved slightly upwards towards the tip. It is long, surpassing twice the length of the avocet&#x27;s small, rounded head. Like many waders, the avocet has long, slender legs and slightly webbed feet. The legs are a pastel grey-blue, giving it its colloquial name, blue shanks. The plumage is black and white on the back, with white on the underbelly. During the breeding season, the plumage is brassy orange on the head and neck, continuing somewhat down to the breast. After the breeding season, these bright feathers are swapped out for white and grey ones. The avocet preens its feathers, commonly considered to be a comfort movement.

The call has been described as both a shrill and melodic alarm , which rises in inflection over time. Avocets use three distinct calls: common call, excited call, and broken wing call. The common call is a loud repeated . The excited call has a similar sound, but it speeds up rather than having an even rhythm. Lastly, the broken wing call is noticeably different from the other two calls. It is a distressed screech sound and is alarming rather than melodic.

==Distribution and habitat==
American avocets were previously found across most of the United States until extirpated from the East Coast. The breeding habitat consists of marshes, beaches, prairie ponds, and shallow lakes in the mid-west, as far north as southern Canada. These breeding grounds are largely in areas just east of the rocky mountains including parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Utah, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, and even down to parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. Their migration route lands them in almost every state in the western United States. The avocet&#x27;s wintering grounds are mainly coastal. Along the Atlantic Ocean, they are found in North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There are also wintering grounds along the Gulf of Mexico in Florida, Texas, and Mexico, and along the Pacific Ocean in California and Mexico. There are resident populations in the Mexican States of Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Mexico City and Puebla, and in Central California.

Flocks ranging from 50 to 300 avocets migrate together to their breeding sites together during peak season, which is typically in the spring.

==Behavior and ecology==
=== Breeding ===

The American avocet breeds in anything from freshwater to hypersaline wetlands in the western and mid-west United States. After reaching their breeding grounds, the avocets quickly establish territory in pairs. Throughout the breeding season, these pairs engage in a series of copulatory displays, which is initiated by either sex and often involves preening. After breeding, the birds gather in large flocks, sometimes amounting to hundreds of birds. Nesting takes place near water, often alongside black-necked stilts, usually on small islands or mucky shorelines. The avocets nest on the ground in places with little to no surrounding vegetation. They make shallow indentations in the ground for their nest and line it with grass, feathers, pebbles or other small objects. Some avocets do not line their nests at all. During the breeding season, avocets lay around 3–5 eggs, with 4 being the most common number. One case study of the 1968 and 1969 breeding seasons suggests that this number allows for the highest rate of hatching success. They incubate them over a period of 23–25 days. Both parents are involved in the incubation process, taking turns during the day (except at night, where only the female incubates the eggs). Both parents take care of the newborn American avocets after they hatch. Male parents are more present in incubation during the first 8 days, whereas female parents dominate incubation throughout the remaining 16 days. Time spent caring for newborn chicks equates to that spent incubating. Since newborns are able to walk, they are capable of feeding themselves and do not require extensive care from their parents. The young are expected to begin flying 4 to 5 weeks after hatching.

=== Anti-predator behavior ===
Each pair defends their own territory against predators and other avocets. Nests are built in areas that predators would struggle to gain access to. Predators that do try to approach the colony find themselves surrounded by several adult avocets running around, trying to distract them. While incubating however, the avocets tend only to their nest and defense is considered a lower priority, unless the eggs are in immediate danger, in which case the avocets may take more aggressive measures, calling loudly and flying at the threat.

=== Food and feeding ===
The American avocet tends to prefer habitats with fine sediments for foraging. In the winter, it feeds extensively on brine shrimp. Usually, this entails the avocet pecking while walking or wading on the shore, but it can also swim to expand foraging area. During the breeding season, avocets continue to eat brine shrimp but switch mainly to consuming brine flies. Brine flies and brine fly larvae are so abundant in avocet breeding grounds that they often blacken the surface of any exposed mud. Brine flies sustain the avocet during its breeding season. The avocet employs both visual and tactile methods of feeding. The primary visual feeding method is pecking at flies. However the avocet will also feed by plunging (wherein the head and neck of the bird are submerged), snatching (wherein the bird catches a flying insect), and bill pursuit (wherein the bird repeatedly opens and closes its bill while moving its head along the surface of the water). Methods of tactile feeding include filtering, scraping, and scythe feeding.

== Threats and conservation status ==

Shooting and trapping of American avocets led to population decline until the 1900s. During this time, the species was extirpated from most of the East Coast of the United States. By 1918, Avocets became protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703–712). Since that time, other threats have emerged. Contaminants and toxins such as DDT, selenium, and methylmercury, have increased in American Avocet habitats in recent years. Although the effects are highly contested, these increased concentrations have potential negative effects on American avocet breeding success, especially because Avocet chicks are more susceptible to environmental disruptions than adults. The avocet also faces habitat loss. While agricultural and industrial environments have become alternate habitat for the avocet, natural wetlands are decreasing rapidly. Additionally, increases in the salinity levels of wetlands have had adverse effects on the breeding and development of avocets. Young avocets in saline or hypersaline environments often combat weight loss and dehydration. Although American avocets face numerous environmental challenges, numbers have stayed steady, and according to the National Audubon Society, numbers have been increasing steadily in the eastern United States for the past few years. The American avocet is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

== In culture ==
In his famous &quot;The Birds of America&quot;, John James Audubon describes a day of stalking and spying on the avocet. He judiciously noted their foraging, nesting, defensive, and flight behaviors.

<text>Narva is a municipality and city in Estonia. It is located in the Ida-Viru County, at the eastern extreme point of Estonia, on the west bank of the Narva river which forms the Estonia–Russia international border. With 53,626 inhabitants (as of 2023) Narva is Estonia&#x27;s third largest city after capital Tallinn and Tartu.

Narva was nearly completely destroyed in 1944 during World War II. During the Soviet era of Estonia in 1944–1991, the city&#x27;s original inhabitants were not permitted to return, and immigrant workers from Soviet Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union (USSR) were introduced. Narva’s population, 65% ethnic Estonian as of the 1934 census, became overwhelmingly non-Estonian in the second half of the 20th century. According to more recent data, 46.7% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants are citizens of Estonia, 36.3% are citizens of the Russian Federation, while 15.3% have undefined citizenship.

==History==
===Early settlement===
People settled in the area from the 5th to 4th millennium BC, as evidenced by archeological findings of the Narva culture, named after the Narva river. The fortified settlement at Narva Joaoru is the oldest known in Estonia, dated to around 1000 BC. The earliest known written reference of the toponym Narva is in the First Novgorod Chronicle, which in the year 1172 describes a district in Novgorod called &quot;Nerevsky&quot; or &quot;Narovsky konets&quot; (yard). According to historians, this name probably derives from the name of the then village of Narva, or from the Narva river, and indicates that a frequently used trade route went through Narva, albeit no evidence of the existence of a trading settlement in Narva at the time has been found so far.

===Middle Ages===
Narva&#x27;s favorable location at the intersection of both trade routes and the Narva river was behind the founding of Narva castle and the subsequent development of the castle&#x27;s surrounding urban settlement. The castle was founded during the Danish rule of northern Estonia in the second half of the 13th century; the earliest written record of the castle is from 1277. &quot;Narvia&quot; village is mentioned in the Danish Census Book already in 1241. A town developed around the stronghold and in 1345 obtained Lübeck City Rights from Danish king Valdemar IV. The castle and surrounding town of Narva (&quot;Narwa&quot;, in German) became a possession of the Livonian Order in 1346, after the Danish king sold its lands in Northern Estonia. In 1492, Ivangorod fortress across the Narva river was established by Ivan III of Moscow.

Trade, particularly Hanseatic long-distance trade remained Narva&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; throughout the Middle Ages. However, due to opposition from Tallinn, Narva itself never became part of the Hanseatic League and also remained a small town – its population in 1530 is estimated at 600–750 people.

===Swedish and Russian rule===

Captured by the Tsardom of Russia (Muscovy) during the Livonian War in 1558–1581, for a short period Narva became an important trading port and transshipment center of Russian goods from Pskov and Novgorod. In 1581, the Swedish troops under the command of Pontus De la Gardie conquered the city and it became part of Sweden. During the Russo-Swedish War (1590–1595), when Arvid Stålarm was governor, Russian forces attempted to regain the city without success (Treaty of Teusina, May 1595).

During the Swedish rule, the baroque Old Town of Narva was built. Following a large fire in 1659 that almost completely destroyed the town, only stone buildings were allowed to be built in its central part. Income from flourishing trade allowed rebuilding of the town center in two decades. Until World War II, the baroque architecture of the Old Town underwent practically no changes, and it became renowned all over Europe. Towards the end of Swedish rule, the defence structures of Narva were greatly improved. Beginning in 1680s, an outstanding system of bastions was designed by renowned military engineer Erik Dahlbergh and built around the town. The new defences were among the most powerful in Northern Europe.

During the Great Northern War of 1700–1721, Narva became the setting for the first great battle between the forces of King Charles XII of Sweden and Tsar Peter I of Russia (Muscovy) in November 1700. Although outnumbered four to one, the Swedish forces routed their 40,000-strong opponent. Tsardom of Russia subsequently conquered the city in 1704.

After the Great Northern War, the bastions were renovated. Narva remained on the list of fortifications of the Russian Empire until 1863, although there turned out to be no real military need for it. Administratively the city of Narva, including its then suburb of Ivangorod (Jaanilinn) was a part of the Saint Petersburg Governorate of the Russian Empire until 1917.

In the middle of the 19th century, Narva developed into a major industrial city. Ludwig Knoop established the Krenholm Manufacturing Company in 1857. The factory used the affordable energy of the powerful Narva waterfalls, and at the end of the century became, with about 10,000 workers, one of the largest cotton mills in Europe and the world. In 1872, Krenholm Manufacturing became the site of the first strike in Estonia. At the end of the 19th century, Narva was the leading industrial town in Estonia – 41% of industrial workers in Estonia worked in Narva, compared to 33% in Tallinn. The first railway in Estonia, completed in 1870, connected Narva to Saint Petersburg and to Tallinn.

In August 1890, Narva was the site of a key meeting between German Kaiser Wilhelm II and Russian Tsar Alexander III.

===Post-World War I period===

The status of Narva was resolved in a July 1917 referendum, when the district population, at that time roughly equally divided between ethnic Russians and Estonians, voted to attach itself to the newly autonomous, and soon to be independent state of, Estonia. Narva became part of the independent Republic of Estonia in 1918, at the end of World War I. The town saw fighting during the Estonian War of Independence. The war started when Russian Bolshevik troops attacked Narva on 28 November 1918, capturing the city on the next day. The Russian bolshevik troops retained control of the city until 19 January 1919.
Heavy battles occurred both in and around Narva during World War II. The city was damaged in the German invasion of 1941 and by smaller air raids throughout the war, but remained relatively intact until February 1944. However, as the focus of the Battle of Narva, the city was destroyed by Soviet bombardment and fires and explosions set by retreating German troops. The most devastating action was the bombing raids of 6 and 7 March 1944 by the Soviet Air Force, which destroyed the Baroque old town.

===Soviet occupation 1944–1991===
By the end of July 1944, 98 per cent of Narva had been destroyed. After the war, most of the buildings could have been restored as the walls of the houses still existed, but in the early 1950s, the Soviet authorities decided to demolish the ruins to make room for apartment buildings. Only three buildings remain of the old town, including the Baroque-style Town Hall. The civilian casualties of the bombing were low as the German forces had evacuated the city in January 1944.

The original native inhabitants were not allowed to return after the war, and immigrant Russian-speaking workers from other parts of the USSR were brought in to populate the city. The city whose population had been 65% Estonian according to the last census in 1934, became overwhelmingly non-Estonian. The main reason behind this was a plan to build a secret uranium processing plant in the city, which would turn Narva into a closed town. In 1947 nearby Sillamäe was selected as the location of the factory instead of Narva, but the existence of such a plan was decisive for the development of Narva in the postwar years, and thus also shaped its later evolution. The planned uranium factory and other large-scale industrial developments, like the restoring of Kreenholm Manufacture, were the driving force behind the influx of internal migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union, mainly Russia.

In January 1945, Jaanilinn (Ivangorod), the suburb on the eastern bank of the river was separated from Estonia (and from Narva) by the Soviet authorities, and the settlement around Ivangorod fortress was made administratively part of the neighboring Leningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR. In 1954, Ivangorod became officially a town in its own rights.


===Restoration of Estonian independence===
After Estonia regained its independence in 1991, the city&#x27;s leaders, holdovers from the Soviet era, wanted autonomy, and contended that the notion of a breakaway &quot;Transnarovan Soviet republic&quot; in northeastern Estonia was becoming increasingly popular, but this was contradicted by polls showing 87% of the region&#x27;s population opposed secession from Estonia.

In 1993, dissatisfaction with newly enacted citizenship and election laws (non-citizens were not allowed to hold office) culminated in the Narva referendum of 16–17 July 1993, which proposed autonomy for both Narva and Sillamäe, a nearby town. Although 97% voted in favor of the referendum, turnout in Narva was a mere 55%, and there were credible charges of vote rigging.

After 1991, disputes regarding the Estonian-Russian border in the Narva sector remained, as the new constitution of Estonia (adopted in 1992) recognizes the 1920 Treaty of Tartu border to be currently legal.

The Russian Federation, however, considers Estonia to be a successor of the Estonian SSR and recognizes the 1945 border between the two former national republics. Officially, Estonia has no territorial claims in the area, and which was also reflected in the new Estonian-Russian border treaty signed in Moscow on 18 May 2005. Russia failed to ratify it because, together with the ratification, the Estonian parliament approved a communiqué, which mentioned the Soviet Occupation.

On 18 February 2014 a new border treaty was signed by both countries. However the treaty was not ratified by the parliaments of either Russia or Estonia.

Overall, by 2014, Russian residents were happy with their status as both Estonian and European Union citizens and lived peacefully alongside their compatriots.

Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, residents mixed relatively freely with the residents across the river in Ivangorod. 

Those on the Estonian side mainly crossed to buy cheaper petrol, groats, cleaning products, pasta and sugar. Those crossing from the Russian side wanted to make use of the availability of non-sanctioned goods, entertainment facilities and overall better infrastructure.

The invasion and subsequent conflict seriously reduced cooperation between the two neighbors, especially as visas became difficult to obtain and the residents of Narva increased the take up in Estonian citizenship. Narva took in many Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war and previously popular Russian TV stations among older Russophone residents were banned by the Estonian government.

On 10 June 2022, the Estonian foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to protest about remarks by President Vladimir Putin praising Peter the Great for having captured Narva in the early 18th century.

In August 2022, a Soviet T-34 tank memorial was removed from a stretch of road between the city center and Narva-Jõesuu, to mixed responses. It was moved to the Estonian War Museum near Tallinn. In response to the tank&#x27;s removal, the following month Russian authorities erected a similar T-34 tank monument in Ivangorod near the border crossing point with Narva.

==Demographics==

On 1 January 2013 Narva&#x27;s population was 59,888, down from 60,454 inhabitants a year earlier. The population was 83,000 in 1992. 95.7% of the population of Narva are native Russian speakers, and 87.7% are ethnic Russians. Most non-Estonians are ethnically Russian, Belarusian, or Ukrainian immigrants or the children of immigrants, though 69% of Narva residents in the early 1990s had been born in Narva or had lived there for more than 30 years. Ethnic Estonians account for 5.2% of total population. Much of the city was destroyed during World War II and for several years during the following reconstruction the Soviet authorities largely prohibited the return of Narva&#x27;s pre-war residents (among whom ethnic Estonians had been the majority, forming 64.8% of the town&#x27;s population of 23,512 according to the 1934 census), thus radically altering the city&#x27;s ethnic composition. Nevertheless, ethnic Russians had already formed a significant minority: 29.7% of the city&#x27;s population were Russian in the census of 1934.

46.7% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants are Estonian citizens, 36.3% are citizens of the Russian Federation, while 15.3% of the population has undefined citizenship. Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine there has been an increase in those acquiring Estonian citizenship in the city.

A concern in Narva is the spread of HIV, which infected 1.2% of Estonia&#x27;s population in 2012. Between 2001 and 2008, more than 1,600 cases of HIV were registered in Narva, making it one of the worst areas in Estonia, alongside Tallinn and the rest of Ida-Viru County. The HIV infection rate in Estonia declined in 2014, with 59 new cases in Narva.

==Geography==
Narva is situated in the eastern extreme point of Estonia, to the east from the Estonian capital Tallinn and southwest from Saint Petersburg. The capital of Ida-Viru County, Jõhvi, lies to the west. The eastern border of the city along the Narva river (which drains Lake Peipus) coincides with the Estonian-Russian border. The Estonian part of the Narva Reservoir lies mostly within the territory of Narva, to the southwest of the city center. The mouth of the Narva river to the Gulf of Finland is about downstream from the city.

The municipality of Narva covers , of which the city proper occupies (excluding the reservoir), while two separate districts surrounded by Vaivara Parish, Kudruküla and Olgina, cover and , respectively. Kudruküla is the largest of Narva&#x27;s dacha regions, located to northwest from the main city, near Narva-Jõesuu.

===Climate===
Narva has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with mild to warm, rainy summers with cool nights and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. Narva is one of the coldest settlements in Estonia, being located at the very northeast of the country and bordering Russia.

===Neighbourhoods===

Narva is officially divided into 15 neighbourhoods: Elektrijaama, Joaoru, Kalevi, Kerese, Kreenholmi, Kudruküla, Kulgu, Olgina, Paemurru, Pähklimäe, Siivertsi, Soldina, Sutthoffi, Vanalinn and Veekulgu.

== Landmarks ==
Narva&#x27;s skyline is dominated by the 15th-century castle, with the Pikk Hermann tower as its most prominent landmark. The sprawling complex of the Kreenholm Manufacture, located in the proximity of scenic waterfalls, is one of the largest textile mills of 19th-century Northern Europe. Other notable buildings include Swedish mansions of the 17th century, a Baroque town hall (1668–71), and remains of Erik Dahlberg&#x27;s fortifications.

Across the Narva river lies the Russian Ivangorod fortress, established during the rule of Grand Prince Ivan III of Muscovy in 1492 and also referred to in some contemporary sources as the &quot;Counter-Narva&quot;. From the 17th century until 1945, both the fortress and the adjacent suburb of Ivangorod () were an administrative part of Narva.

Narva Kreenholmi Stadium is home to Meistriliiga football team, FC Narva Trans.

==Transportation==
The Narva railway station is located on an international railway line between Estonia and Russia (Tallinn–Narva railway). All passenger trains between Russia and Estonia were cancelled during the pandemic in 2020 and the service has not been resumed. There is a domestic train service between Saint Petersburg and Ivangorod. Hence, it is possible to travel between Narva and Saint Petersburg by train if one crosses the border between Narva and Ivangorod by foot. The walking distance between the border station and Ivangorod train station is about 3.5 km.

Five daily domestic trains run between Narva and Tallinn. Some are express, which takes about hours.

Adjacent to the central rail station is a central bus station, which has multiple domestic and international connections (including to Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus etc.). The direct bus routes to Russia ceased on February 1, 2024, since the Russian Federation closed the border between Narva and Ivangorod for traffic - only pedestrians are now permitted to cross the border. 

There is a general aviation grass airfield near Narva (ICAO: EENA). The strip is 600 meters long.

==Sport==
The two main professional sports in the city are ice hockey and football.

Narva PSK play at the Narva Ice Hall, which also was the host arena of the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Division I Championship Group B.

JK Narva Trans play at the Narva Kreenholm Stadium. They are founding members of the Meistriliiga, and are one of two clubs which have never been relegated from the Estonian top division. They have won 2 Estonian Cups and 2 Estonian Supercups.

<text>Pärnu () is the fourth-largest city in Estonia. Situated in southwest Estonia, Pärnu is located south of the Estonian capital, Tallinn, and west of Estonia&#x27;s second-largest city, Tartu. The city sits off the coast of Pärnu Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Riga, which is a part of the Baltic Sea. In the city, the Pärnu River drains into the Gulf of Riga.

Pärnu is a popular summer holiday resort town among Estonians with many hotels, restaurants and large beaches. The city is served by Pärnu Airport.

==History==
Pärnu or Old Pärnu (, , ), which was founded by the bishop of Ösel–Wiek , suffered heavily under pressure of the concurrent town, and was finally destroyed . Another town, Embeke (later , ) was founded by the Livonian Order, who began building an Ordensburg nearby in 1265. The latter town, then known by the German name of , was a member of the Hanseatic League and an important ice-free harbor for Livonia. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth took control of town between 1560 and 1617; the Poles and Lithuanians fought the Swedes nearby in 1609. Sweden took control of the town during the 16th-century Livonian War as part of Swedish Livonia, although it was not formally ceded by Poland-Lithuania until the 1660 Treaty of Oliva. Sweden then lost Livonia to the Russian Empire in the 1710 Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia and the 1721 Treaty of Nystad, following the Great Northern War. It belonged to the Imperial Russian Governorate of Livonia until 1917, when it was transferred to the short-lived Autonomous Governorate of Estonia. The city is occasionally referred to as &quot;Pyarnu&quot;, an incorrect reverse-transliteration from the Russian .

The town became part of independent Estonia in 1918 following World War I and the Estonian War of Independence.

The city was occupied by the Soviet Red Army along with the rest of Estonia in 1940 during World War II, and its German population fled the town. It was briefly occupied by Germany from 1941 until 1944 before it was reoccupied by the Soviet Union during its counteroffensives. Pärnu then continued as being part of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1944 to 1991, when Estonia restored its independence.

During the Great Northern War, the University of Dorpat (Tartu) was relocated to Pärnu from 1699 to 1710. The university has still maintained a branch campus in Pärnu to this day (1,000 students in the 2004/2005 school year).

==Economy==

Today Pärnu is an economically balanced region with a comprehensive range of industries. Foreign investments and new businesses with up-to-date technologies have enhanced job creation and higher competitiveness of the businesses in the world markets. Several enterprises of Pärnu region stand out as the best in Estonia.

Significant flows of exports from Pärnu region and South-Estonia pass through the Port of Pärnu which lies at the mouth of the Pärnu River. In recent years, the port has developed into an important regional harbour for south-western and southern Estonia.
Pärnu&#x27;s fame as a rehabilitation and holiday resort dates back to the middle of the 19th century. The foundation of the first bathing facility in 1838 is considered the birth date of Pärnu resort. Today Pärnu has all desirable qualities of a modern holiday resort – it has spas and rehabilitation centres, hotels, conference and concert venues, golf courses and tennis courts, restaurants and pubs. It&#x27;s long tradition as a resort has made Pärnu well known in Finland and Scandinavian countries.

==Tourism==
The majority of the tourists in Pärnu are Finns, Swedes and Russians. German, Latvian, and Norwegian tourists have also become more common.

In 1837, a tavern near the beach was made into a bathing establishment. The establishment accommodated 5–6 bathrooms that provided hot seawater baths in summer and operated as a sauna in winter. The wooden building was burnt down in the course of World War I. In 1927, the present stone building of Pärnu Mud Baths was erected at the same site.

Since 1996 Pärnu has been known as Estonia&#x27;s Summer Capital.

Starting from 2015 the city of Pärnu hosts the annual Weekend Festival, the largest dance music festival in the Nordic and Baltic region. Stages are headlined by DJs from across the electronic dance music spectrum, with audiovisual support.

<text>Olavinlinna (), also known as St. Olaf&#x27;s Castle, is a 15th-century three-tower castle located in Savonlinna, Finland. It is built on an island in the Kyrönsalmi strait that connects the lakes Haukivesi and Pihlajavesi. It is the northernmost medieval stone fortress still standing.
The castle forms a spectacular stage for the Savonlinna Opera Festival, which was held for the first time in the summer of 1912.

== History ==
The fortress was founded by Erik Axelsson Tott in 1475 under the name &quot;Sankt Olofsborg&quot; in an effort to profit from the political turmoil following Ivan III&#x27;s conquest of the Novgorod Republic. It was sited in Savonia so as to lay claim to the Russian side of the border established by the Treaty of Nöteborg.

One of Tott&#x27;s letters from 1477 includes a passing mention of foreign builders invited to Olofsborg, probably from Reval, where the city fortifications were being extended. It was the first Swedish castle provided with a set of thickset circular towers that could withstand cannon fire. It is not by accident that a network of lakes and waterways forms the setting for the castle, for these would seriously impede a prospective Russian offensive.

The three-towered keep was completed in 1485, and the construction of the outer curtain walls with two towers was initiated immediately. They were completed in 1495. The castle is roughly a truncated rhomboid with keep on the western side of the island and the curtain walls and outer bailey to east. One of the towers of the keep, St. Erik&#x27;s Tower, has a bad foundation and has since collapsed. One of the towers of Bailey, the Thick Tower, exploded in 1791. A bastion, The Thick Bastion, has been built on its place. The castle was converted into a Vaubanesque fort in the late 18th century with bastions.

=== Warfare ===
Olofsborg withstood several sieges by the Russians during the First and Second Russian-Swedish wars. A brisk trade developed under the umbrella of the castle towards the end of the 16th century, giving birth to the town of Savonlinna, which was chartered in 1639.

While the castle was never captured by force, its garrison agreed to terms of surrender twice; first to invading Russians on 28 July 1714 and the second time on 8 August 1743, with the latter conflict&#x27;s peace treaty in form of the Treaty of Åbo leading to the castle and the entire region being seceded to Empress Elizabeth of Russia. During the Russian era Alexander Suvorov personally inspected rearmament of the fortress.

Several devastating fires destroyed much of the castle&#x27;s decor in the 19th century, all of its original furnishings were destroyed.

=== Border conflicts ===

After the conclusion of the Russo-Swedish War 1495-1497, Sten Sture returned to Sweden and discovered that a large revolt had begun against him, resulting in the Battle of Rotebro where he was deposed in favor of King Hans of Denmark.

In August of 1499, the governor of Vyborg, Eric Bielke, received alarming reports about battles against Russian forces who believed Nyslott was rightfully Russian and were attempting to move the border posts to include the town within Russian territory. Of the 1,000 Russians that took part in the fighting, only about 200 are said to have been equipped with firearms; the others fought with axes and sabers. In the following battles, the Russians suffered heavy casualties and were repulsed.

While further details on the battles are not known, they seem to have been limited to the area around Nyslott. On the 14th of September 1504, Eric Bielke was able to sign a truce lasting 20 years with the Russians. The next major war between Sweden and Russia would not come until 1554. Despite this, there was no guaranteed peace on the border between them, and among other things a letter from 1509 tells that &quot;the enemies of God and Christendom, the intransigent Russians&quot; have ravaged Finland.

== Tourism ==
The castle hosts several small exhibitions. These include the Castle Museum which displays artifacts found in the castle or related to it, and the Orthodox Museum which displays icons and other religious artifacts both from Finland and Russia.

Olavinlinna is the initial model for Kropow Castle in the bande dessinée &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, an album in the series of Adventures of Tintin created by Hergé.

<text>The Deutsche Bundesbank (, , colloquially Buba, sometimes alternatively abbreviated as BBk or DBB) is the German member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Germany from 1957 to 1998, issuing the Deutsche Mark (DM). It succeeded the Bank deutscher Länder, which had introduced the DM on 20 June 1948.

The Bundesbank was the first central bank to be given full independence, leading this form of central bank to be referred to as the &quot;Bundesbank model&quot;, as opposed, for instance, to the &quot;New Zealand model&quot;, which has a goal (i.e. inflation target) set by the government. The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. This made the German Mark one of the most respected currencies, and the Bundesbank gained substantial indirect influence in many European countries. As of 2023, its balance sheet total was €2.516 trillion, making it the 4th largest central bank in the world.

==History==
===Background (1948–1957)===

The history of the Bundesbank is inextricably linked with the history of the German currency after the Second World War. Following the total destruction after the war, the old Reichsmark was practically worthless, and a currency reform was implemented in the western occupation zones including West Berlin: on 21 June 1948, the D-Mark, or Deutsche Mark, replaced the Reichsmark. The currency reform was based on laws enacted by the Allied military government. In preparation, the Western Powers established a new two-tier central bank system in the occupied zones; in its federal structure, it was modeled on the Federal Reserve System of the US. It comprised the central banks of the states (&quot;Länder&quot;) of the West German occupation zones and the Bank deutscher Länder in Frankfurt am Main, which was created on 1 March 1948. The central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; acted as central banks within their areas of jurisdiction. The Bank deutscher Länder, whose share capital was held by the central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot;, was responsible for issuing bank notes, co-ordinating policy and various central tasks including management of foreign exchange. The supreme governing body of the two-tier central bank system was the Central Bank Council (&quot;Zentralbankrat&quot;) set up at the Bank deutscher Länder. It consisted of a president, the presidents of the central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; and the president of the directorate (board) of the Bank deutscher Länder. Amongst other things, the Central Bank Council determined policy on bank rate and minimum reserve policy, open-market policy guidelines and granting of credit. After the negative experience with a central bank subject to government orders, the principle of an independent central bank was established. The &quot;Bank deutscher Länder&quot; was independent of German political bodies from the start, including the federal German government, which was active from September 1949. It achieved independence from the Allies in 1951.

===1957–1990===
The German &quot;Basic Law&quot; (constitution), which had come into force on 23 May 1949, placed an obligation on the German federal legislature to establish a federal bank responsible for the issue of bank notes and currency. The legislature fulfilled this obligation by passing the Bundesbank Act (&quot;BBankG&quot;) of 26 July 1957, which abolished the two-tier structure of the central bank system. The central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; were now no longer independent note-issuing banks, but became regional headquarters of the Bundesbank, nevertheless retaining the title &quot;state central bank&quot; (&quot;Landeszentralbank&quot;).

The Central Bank Council remained the supreme decision-making body of the Bundesbank. It was now made up of the presidents of the central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; and a board of directors based in Frankfurt. The Central Bank Council decided on the currency and credit policy and laid down rules for management. As the central executive body of the Bundesbank, the Directorate (&quot;Direktorium&quot;) was responsible for implementing the decisions of the Central Bank Council. The Directorate ran the bank and was, in particular, responsible for dealings with the federal government and its &quot;special assets&quot; (&quot;Sondervermögen&quot;), for transactions with credit institutes operating in the Federal republic of Germany, for currency transactions, and foreign commercial transactions, and for open-market dealings. The Directorate was made up of the president and the vice-president of the Bundesbank and up to six additional members.

The central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; carried out business falling in their areas independently. The Bundesbank Act explicitly made them responsible for dealings with public bodies and credit institutes. The central Banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; also controlled the subsidiary bodies (&quot;Zweiganstalten&quot;), now called branches (&quot;Filialen&quot;). Overall management of each &quot;Land&quot; central bank was in the hands of its executive board (&quot;Vorstand&quot;), which as a rule consisted of the president and the vice-president of the bank.

===1990–1993===
In the wake of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic signed a treaty on 18 May 1990, that created an economic, social and currency union between the two German states; it came into force on 1 July 1990, and made the Deutsche Mark the sole legal tender in both German states. The Bundesbank was made responsible for money and currency policy within the whole of the currency union. A &quot;Provisional Administration Body&quot; was set up for the purpose of implementing the treaty, and this body continued to operate beyond the official date of reunification until 31 October 1990. The Bundesbank Act was amended to adjust the organizational structure of the Bundesbank to better match changed circumstances following German reunification, and at the same time streamline the organisation. The eleven central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; and the Provisional Administrative Body were replaced by nine central banks of similar economic size.

===1993–2001===
The Maastricht Treaty that came into force on 1 November 1993 laid the foundation for the European Economic and Currency Union (EECU). National responsibility for monetary policy was transferred, at the Community level, to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), comprising the European Central bank (ECB) and the national central banks (NCBs) of the EU states. Until the ECB became fully responsible for currency in 2001, the Bundesbank had three governing bodies. The Central Bank Council (&quot;Zentralbankrat&quot;) was the supreme body of the Bundesbank. It was made up of:
# the Directorate, which comprised the president, the vice-president and six additional members. These eight people were nominated by the Federal Government (&quot;Bundesregierung&quot;)
# The nine presidents of the &quot;Landeszentralbanken&quot;. These were nominated by the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;.
The Directorate was the executive body of the Bundesbank, while all currency policy decisions were made by the Central Bank Council.

===2001–present===
In 2001 the ECB took over full control of currency. The Bundesbank Act was last amended in 2002 by the 7th Law Amending the Law on the Bundesbank of 30 April 2002, which gave the Bundesbank its current structure.

==The Bundesbank today==
After the ECB took over responsibility for currency, the Bundesbank continued to exist. Its duties were redefined by the 7th Law amending the &quot;Law on the German Bundesbank&quot; of 30 April 2002, in Section 3 of the Bundesbank Act:
:The Bundesbank, being the central bank of the Federal Republic of Germany, is an integral part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). It shall participate in the performance of the ESCB&#x27;s tasks with the primary objective of maintaining price stability, and shall arrange for the execution of domestic and international payments. In addition, it shall discharge the duties assigned to it under this Act or other legislation.

Unlike other central banks such as the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve (but like the ECB), the Bundesbank is not officially responsible for maintaining the stability of the financial system and is not a lender of last resort. For 2022, the Bundesbank recorded its first loss since 1979.

Based on the Bundesbank Act and the ECB Statute, the Bundesbank has four areas of activity, which it mostly handles jointly with the ECB:

===The Bundesbank as a note-issuing bank===
As a note-issuing bank, the Bundesbank provides the economy with cash, and ensures the physical circulation of cash. It checks the cash delivered by banks and money transport companies, removes counterfeit money from circulation and hands it to the police. It changes D-Mark holdings still in circulation, without any time limit and replaces damaged or mutilated notes (National Analysis Centre for Counterfeit and Damaged Banknotes and Coins). It also issues information on the safety mechanisms for notes and coins and issues a weekly bulletin on the volume of cash in circulation.
===The Bundesbank as the banks&#x27; banker===
In relation to the commercial banking system, the Bundesbank has two functions:

====Clearing house for commercial banks====
Firstly, the Bundesbank is a &quot;refinancing source&quot; and clearing house for the commercial banks. The commercial banks can use what are known as &quot;refinancing instruments&quot; to cover their needs for central bank money through the Bundesbank and the ECB. Until the end of 1998, the control of the money supply by this method was one of the main tasks of the Bundesbank. Since 1 January 1999, one of the principal aims of the ECB has been to maintain price stability by means of its monetary strategy. Commercial banks can deposit money that is temporarily surplus to requirements with the Bundesbank/ECB (known as a deposit facility). The Bundesbank supports cross-border payments between domestic and foreign commercial banks, for instance by means of the German real time gross transfer system RTGSplus and, since 2007, through its participation in the Eurosystem&#x27;s TARGET Services.

====Bank supervision====
The bank also helps to regulate commercial banks, in close cooperation with the German financial regulatory agency the &quot;Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht&quot; (BaFin).

===The Bundesbank as the state&#x27;s banker===
As the state&#x27;s banker, the Bundesbank provides accounts and performs normal banking services for federal, state (&quot;Land&quot;) and local authorities, as well as for the statutory social security organizations. All such accounts are required to have a positive balance, i.e. the Bundesbank is not allowed to grant credits to the public sector. This is due to negative historical precedents in connection with the financing of two world wars by the Deutsche Reichsbank. It also carries out securities transactions for the federal government (&quot;Bundesfinanzagentur&quot;).

===The Bundesbank as the keeper of the currency reserves===
Currency reserves are all assets of the Bundesbank that are not specified in EUR, including gold reserves, securities in foreign currency, credit with foreign banks, foreign exchange, etc. Currency reserves can be invested for profit and also provide a possibility of intervening in the market if the exchange rate fluctuates strongly. The gold reserves of the Bundesbank are the second largest in the world (after the U.S. Federal Reserve). As of late 2021, the Bundesbank has over 3,359 tonnes of gold reserves.

====Structure====

The Bundesbank has nine regional headquarters in the &quot;Länder&quot;, the former central banks of the &quot;Länder&quot; and 31 branches (&quot;Filiale&quot;). As of 30 June 2006, the Bundesbank had a total of 12,474 employees. These are available to banks, public authorities and money transport enterprises for the provision of cash and the clearing of credit transfer.
The nine regional headquarters are:
* Frankfurt – federal headquarters, also governing the state of Hesse.
* Stuttgart, governing the state of Baden-Württemberg
* Munich, governing the state of Bavaria
* Berlin, governing federal city Berlin and the state of Brandenburg
* Hanover, governing the states of Bremen, Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt
* Hamburg, governing the states of Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein
* Düsseldorf, governing the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
* Mainz, governing the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland
* Leipzig, governing the states of Saxony and Thuringia

====Governance====
The executive board (&quot;Vorstand&quot;) is the supreme governing body of the Bundesbank. It comprises: the president, the vice president and one additional board member, nominated by the German government, plus three additional members of the executive board, nominated by the Bundesrat. All members of the executive board are appointed by the President of Germany, normally for eight years, but at least for five years.

==Disputes between the Bundesbank and the government==
The statutory independence of the central bank guaranteed by the Bundesbank Act does not ensure that there will be no disputes between the central bank and government.

===Dispute over currency union with East Germany===
One particularly public dispute was in the lead-up to German re-unification. When a customs union was created between the former East Germany (German Democratic Republic) and West Germany (the &quot;old&quot; Federal Republic of Germany), there was a dispute over the rate of exchange for conversion of East German money to Deutschmarks. The Chancellor (Helmut Kohl) decided to ignore the advice of the Bundesbank, and chose an exchange rate of 1:1. The Bundesbank feared that this would be excessively inflationary as well as very significantly impairing the economic prospects of the area of the former East Germany. This dispute was particularly public because of the Bundesbank policy of communicating openly on such matters. Although public opinion normally supported the Bundesbank in matters of combating inflation, in this case Helmut Kohl prevailed, and the President of the Bundesbank, Pöhl, resigned. The Bundesbank had to use monetary measures to offset the inflationary effect.

==The Bundesbank in the news==
In 2004 the president of the Bundesbank, Ernst Welteke, resigned after the press published allegations that his hotel bills for a New Year celebration had been paid by a commercial bank and he was criticized for his handling of the affair. There were also some allegations that this was part of a political intrigue to remove Welteke from office because he opposed selling Bundesbank gold reserves, as desired by the government. After Pöhl (see above), Welteke was the second Bundesbank president to resign.

On Wednesday, 24 February 2016, as part of the Bundesbank&#x27;s annual news conference, Bundesbank president and European Central Bank Governing Council member, Jens Weidmann, dismissed deflation in light of the ECB&#x27;s current stimulus program, pointing out the healthy condition of the German economy and that the euro area isn&#x27;t that bad off, on the eve of the 9–10 March 2016 meetings.

==Involvement in the European sovereign debt crisis==
In June 2012, it was estimated that the Bundesbank had €644 billion exposure to other central banks in the eurozone under the TARGET2 payment system. Only three other eurozone central banks had net exposure from the system; all others had the offsetting net exposure due to the system. The net exposure finances trade imbalances and capital flight. The Bundesbank is the largest shareholder of the European Central Bank. The ECB has bought up more than €200 billion in sovereign debt from crisis-ridden countries. Some of this would have to be written off in the case of a euro collapse, which would entail corresponding losses for the Bundesbank.

On 27 January 2014, the Bundesbank called for a capital levy on citizens of a nation before that nation applies for relief under the European Financial Stability Facility. The levy &quot;corresponds to the principle of national responsibility, according to which tax payers are responsible for their government&#x27;s obligations before solidarity of other states is required&quot;. This followed an IMF report from October 2013 which proposed a similar wealth tax.

<text>Lee Jong-wook (; 12 April 1945 – 22 May 2006) was a South Korean physician. He was the director-general of the World Health Organization for three years. Lee joined the WHO in 1983, working on a variety of projects including the &quot;Global Programme for Vaccines and Immunizations&quot; and &quot;Stop Tuberculosis&quot;. He began his term as director-general in 2004, and was the first figure from Korea to lead an international agency.

In 2004, Lee was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
Born on 12 April 1945 in Keijō, Keiki-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan (now Seoul, South Korea).

Lee received a Bachelors in Engineering from Hanyang University, followed by a medical degree at Seoul National University, and a Master of Medicine at the University of Hawaii in public health. He is the third son in a family of six children; he has three brothers and two sisters. Two of his brothers are professors.

Lee took care of leprosy patients in Anyang, South Korea when he was studying medicine. There were few medical facilities set up at the time and he worked in a volunteer capacity. He met and later married Kaburaki Reiko, a Japanese woman who visited Korea in order to volunteer in the country.

== WHO career ==
He worked at the World Health Organization (WHO), at country, regional and headquarter levels for 23 years. His work in WHO started in 1983 when he worked with leprosy in Fiji. He started his work as an advisor on leprosy, and later also treated tuberculosis and promoted the vaccination of children against preventable diseases.

In 1994, Lee moved to Geneva to work at WHO headquarters as chief in prevention and vaccines. In 1995, he was nicknamed Vaccine Czar according to Scientific American. Lee became official candidate for 6th director-generals of WHO.

* 1983–2006: Staff of WHO
* 1994–98: Director in Global Programme for Vaccines and Immunization, and Executive Secretary, Children&#x27;s Vaccine Initiative
* 1998–99: Senior Policy Adviser to 5th General, Gro Harlem Brundtland
* 1999–2000: Special Representative of the Director-General
* 2003–2006: Director-General of WHO

He had said that global efforts to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic would be the right course that would give meaning to his tenure as director-general of the agency.

The 3 by 5 policy, which was the basic idea of Lee, was largely criticized by many concerned people. International AIDS Society president Joep Lange, had a comment that the project was &quot;totally unrealistic&quot;. Médecins sans Frontières, also expressed similar reservations toward Lee&#x27;s plan.

He visited 60 countries in the three years of his Generalship including Darfur, Sudan, sites of the Indian Ocean tsunami, Madagascar, Mauritius. He was famed as a &quot;man of action&quot; during this time. His adventurous spirit led him to &quot;experience more, see more, and do more,&quot; said his son Tadahiro.

==Death and commemoration==
He died on 22 May 2006, in intensive care unit of Geneva University Hospital, Switzerland, following emergency surgery for a blood clot in the brain (a subdural hematoma). He had been preparing for UN general meetings when he fell ill at a weekend luncheon.

Secretary General of United Nations at that time, Kofi Annan mentioned 

President George W. Bush of the United States said
He was posthumously awarded the Hibiscus Cordon (Grand Cross) of the Order of Civil Merit by the South Korean government.
He was survived by Reiko Kaburaki Lee; the couple has one son, Tadahiro Lee. Reiko continues to volunteer in Peru helping poor women and children.

==Memorial award==
The South Korean government officially announced the establishment of the a Memorial Prize in Lee&#x27;s memory. After his death, You Si min, the Minister of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea, officially revealed the plans concerning the new awards and urged other nations and persons concerned to participate at a meeting of WHO in 2007. Mr. Lee Sung-joo, who is permanent representative of the Republic of Korea, spoke of the award in Dr. Lee&#x27;s memory to motivate and inspire young leaders aspiring to be the next Dr. Lee Jong-wook.

Starting in 2009, the awards would be given for mainly the fields &quot;young leadership&quot; and &quot;contributor of health management&quot; (especially for epidemics) at the annual assembly of WHO, which takes place in May each year.

<text>A dwarf star is a star of relatively small size and low luminosity. Most main sequence stars are dwarf stars. The meaning of the word &quot;dwarf&quot; was later extended to some star-sized objects that are not stars, and compact stellar remnants that are no longer stars.

==History==
The term was originally coined in 1906 when the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung noticed that the reddest stars – classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme – could be divided into two distinct groups. They are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, he called them &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot; stars, the dwarf stars being fainter and the giants being brighter than the Sun.

Most stars are currently classified under the &quot;Morgan Keenan System&quot; using the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, a sequence from the hottest: &quot;type O&quot;, to the coolest: &quot;type M&quot;.

With the development of infrared astronomy in the late 20th century the Morgan Keenan system was extended to cooler types L and T, all of which are &quot;dwarfs&quot; but not all of which are stars as such.

==Current uses of the term &quot;dwarf&quot;==

The scope of the term &quot;dwarf&quot; at present includes the following:

* &quot;Dwarf star&quot; with no other qualification generally refers to a main-sequence star, a star of luminosity class V: main-sequence stars (dwarfs). Example: Achernar (B6Vep)
** &quot;Red dwarfs&quot; are low-mass main-sequence stars.
** &quot;Yellow dwarfs&quot; are main-sequence (dwarf) stars with masses comparable to that of the Sun.
** &quot;Orange dwarfs&quot; are K-type main-sequence stars.
** Blue (type O and type B) main sequence stars are so large that they are difficult to distinguish from blue giant stars, either in size or brightness, and because of the cognitive dissonance, the word &quot;dwarf&quot; is avoided when referring to them. 
* A &quot;blue dwarf&quot; is a hypothesized class of very-low-mass stars that increase in temperature as they near the end of their main-sequence lifetime. (It is believed that the universe is not old enough for any red dwarf to have yet reached the so-called &quot;blue&quot; stage, which is actually more of a medium white.
* A &quot;white dwarf&quot; is the remains of a dead star, composed of electron-degenerate matter. It is thought to be the final stage in the evolution of stars not massive enough to collapse into a neutron star or black hole – stars less massive than roughly 9 .
** A &quot;black dwarf&quot; is theorized as a white dwarf that has cooled sufficiently that it no longer emits any visible light. It is believed that the universe is not old enough for any white dwarf to have yet cooled to &quot;black&quot;.
* A &quot;brown dwarf&quot; is a substellar object not massive enough to ever fuse hydrogen into helium, but still massive enough to fuse deuterium – less than about 0.08   and more than about 13 Jupiter masses.

<doc id="274319" wikidata="Q683800" url="?curid=274319" title="2003 Scottish Parliament election">
<text>The 2003 Scottish Parliament election was the second election of members to the Scottish Parliament. It was held on 1 May 2003 and it brought no change in terms of control of the Scottish Executive. Jack McConnell, the Labour Party MSP, remained in office as First Minister for a second term and the Executive continued as a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition. As of 2023, it remains the last Scottish Parliament election victory for the Scottish Labour Party, and the last time the Scottish National Party lost a Holyrood election.

The results also showed rises in support for smaller parties, including the Scottish Green Party and the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and declines in support for the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party (SNP). The Conservative and Unionist Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats each polled almost exactly the same percentage of the vote as they had in the 1999 election, with each holding the same number of seats as before.

Three independent MSPs were elected: Dennis Canavan, Margo MacDonald and Jean Turner. John Swinburne, leader of the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party, was also elected. This led to talk of a &quot;rainbow&quot; Parliament, but the arithmetic meant that the coalition of Labour and Scottish Liberal Democrats could continue in office, which they did until the 2007 election.

The decline in support for the SNP was viewed by some as a rejection of the case for Scottish independence. Others argued against this, pointing out that the number of MSPs in favour of independence actually rose because most of the minor parties such as the SSP share this position with the SNP.

==Retiring MSPs==
At the dissolution of Parliament on 31 March 2003, ten MSPs were not seeking re-election.

==Campaign==
The parliament was dissolved on 31 March 2003 and the campaign began thereafter.

==Party leaders in 2003==
*Labour – Jack McConnell
*SNP – John Swinney
*Conservative – David McLetchie
*Liberal Democrat – Jim Wallace
*Greens – Robin Harper &amp; Eleanor Scott (co-chairs)
*SSP – Tommy Sheridan

===Defeated MSPs===

====Labour====

<doc id="274322" wikidata="Q689182" url="?curid=274322" title="World Summit on the Information Society">
<text>The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was a two-phase United Nations-sponsored summit on information, communication and, in broad terms, the information society that took place in 2003 in Geneva and in 2005 in Tunis. WSIS Forums have taken place periodically since then. One of the Summit&#x27;s chief aims is to bridge the global digital divide separating rich countries from poor countries by increasing internet accessibility in the developing world. The conferences established 17 May as World Information Society Day.

The WSIS+10 Process marked the ten-year milestone since the 2005 Summit. In 2015, the stocktaking process culminated with a High-Level meeting of the UN General Assembly on 15 and 16 December in New York. A WSIS+20 review will take place in 2025.

==Background==
In the last decades of the 20th century, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has changed modern society in many ways. This is often referred to as the digital revolution, and along with it have come new opportunities and threats. Many world leaders hope to use ICT to solve societal problems; yet, at the same time, there are concerns about the digital divide, both international level and domestic levels. This trend could lead to shaping new classes of those who have access to ICT and those who do not.
Recognizing that these challenges and opportunities require global discussion on the highest level, the government of Tunisia made a proposal at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Plenipotentiary Conference in Minneapolis in 1998 to hold a World Summit on the Information Society. This resolution was then put forward it to the United Nations.
In 2001, the ITU Council decided to hold the Summit in two phases, the first from 10 to 12 December 2003, in Geneva, and the second from 16 to 18 November 2005 in Tunis.

On 21 December 2001, the United Nations General Assembly by approving Resolution 56/183 endorsed the holding of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) to discuss on information society opportunities and challenges. According to this resolution, the General Assembly related the Summit to the United Nations Millennium Declaration to implement ICT to facilitate achieving Millennium Development Goals. It also emphasized on the multi-stakeholder approach to use all stakeholders including civil society and private sector beside the governments. The resolution gave ITU the leading managerial role to organize the event in cooperation with other UN bodies as well as the other international organizations and the host countries and recommended that preparations for the Summit take place through an open-ended intergovernmental Preparatory Committee – or PrepCom – that would define the agenda of the Summit, decide on the modalities of the participation of other stakeholders, and finalize both the draft Declaration of Principles and the draft Plan of Action.

==Geneva Summit, 2003==
In 2003 at Geneva, delegates from 175 countries took part in the first phase of WSIS where they adopted a Declaration of Principles. This is a road map for achieving an information society accessible to all and based on shared knowledge. A Plan of Action sets out a goal of bringing 50 percent of the world&#x27;s population online by 2015. It does not spell out any specifics of how this might be achieved. The Geneva summit also left unresolved more controversial issues, including the question of Internet governance and funding.

When the 2003 summit failed to agree on the future of Internet governance, the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) was formed to come up with ideas on how to progress.

Civil Society delegates from NGOs produced a document called &quot;Shaping Information Societies for Human Needs&quot; that brought together a wide range of issues under a human rights and communication rights umbrella.

According to the Geneva Plan of Action the WSIS Action Lines are as follows:
* C1. The role of public governance authorities and all stakeholders in the promotion of ICTs for development
* C2. Information and communication infrastructure
* C3. Access to information and knowledge
* C4. Capacity building
* C5. Building confidence and security in the use of ICTs
* C6. Enabling environment
* C7. ICT Applications:
** E-government
** E-business
** E-learning
** E-health
** E-employment
** E-environment
** E-agriculture
** E-science
* C8. Cultural diversity and identity, linguistic diversity and local content
* C9. Media
* C10. Ethical dimensions of the Information Society
* C11. International and regional cooperation

==Tunis Summit, 2005==
The second phase took place from 16 through 18 November 2005, in Tunis, Tunisia. It resulted in agreement on the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, and the creation of the Internet Governance Forum.

Just on the eve of the November 2005 Tunis event, the Association for Progressive Communications came out with its stand. (APC is an international network of civil society organizations—whose goal is to empower and support groups and individuals working for peace, human rights, development and protection of the environment, through the strategic use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), including the internet). 

APC said it had participated extensively in the internet governance process at the World Summit on Information Society. It says: Out of this participation and in collaboration with other partners, including members of the WSIS civil society internet governance caucus, APC has crystallized a set of recommendations with regard to internet governance ahead of the final Summit in Tunis in November 2005.
APC proposed specific actions in each of the following five areas:
* The establishment of an Internet Governance Forum;
* The transformation of ICANN into a global body with full authority over DNS management, and an appropriate form of accountability to its stakeholders in government, private sector, and civil society;
* The initiation of a multi-stakeholder convention on internet governance and universal human rights that will codify the basic rights applicable to the internet, which will be legally binding in international law with particular emphasis on clauses in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights directly relevant to the internet, such as the rights to freedom of expression, association, and privacy.
* Ensuring internet access is universal and affordable. APC argued: &quot;The internet is a global public space that should be open and accessible to all on a non-discriminatory basis. The internet, therefore, must be seen as a global public infrastructure. In this regard we recognize the internet to be a global public good related to the concept of the common heritage of humanity and access to it is in the public interest, and must be provided as a global public commitment to equality&quot;.
* Measures to promote capacity building in &quot;developing&quot; countries with regard to increasing &quot;developing&quot; country participation in global public policy forums on internet governance.

The summit itself attracted 1,500 people from International Organizations, 6,200 from NGOs, 4,800 from the private sector, and 980 from the media.

Funding for the event was provided by several countries. The largest donations to the 2003 event came from Japan and Spain. The 2005 event received funding from Japan, Sweden, France and many other countries as well as companies like Nokia.

===Conference developments===
A dispute over control of the Internet threatened to derail the conference. However, a last-minute decision to leave control in the hands of the United States-based ICANN for the time being avoided a major blow-up. As a compromise there was also an agreement to set up an international Internet Governance Forum and Enhanced Cooperation, with a purely consultative role.

The summit itself was marred by criticism of Tunisia for allowing attacks on journalists and human rights defenders to occur in the days leading up to the event. The Tunisian government tried to prevent one of the scheduled sessions, &quot;Expression Under Repression&quot;, from happening. French reporter Robert Ménard, the president of Reporters sans frontières, (Reporters Without Borders) was refused admission to Tunisia for phase two of the Summit. A French journalist for &quot;Libération&quot; was stabbed and beaten by unidentified men after he reported on local human rights protesters. The representatives of the Human Rights in China NGO (due to Chinese government pressure on Tunisia) were refused entry to Tunisia. A Belgian television crew was harassed and forced to hand over footage of Tunisian dissidents. Local human rights defenders were roughed up and prevented from organizing a meeting with international civil society groups.

==Stocktaking process==


The WSIS stocktaking process is a follow-up to WSIS. Its purpose is to provide a register of activities carried out by governments, international organizations, the business sector, civil society and other entities, in order to highlight the progress made since the landmark event. Following § 120 of TAIS, ITU has been maintaining the WSIS Stocktaking database as a publicly accessible system providing information on ICT-related initiatives and projects with reference to the 11 WSIS Action Lines.

ECOSOC Resolution 2010/12 on &quot;Assessment of the progress made in the implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society&quot; reiterated the importance of maintaining a process for coordinating the multi-stakeholder implementation of WSIS outcomes through effective tools, with the goal of exchanging of information among WSIS Action Line Facilitators; identification of issues that need improvements; and discussion of the modalities of reporting the overall implementation process. The resolution encourages all WSIS stakeholders to continue to contribute information to the WSIS Stocktaking database (www.wsis.org/stocktaking).

Furthermore, regular reporting on WSIS Stocktaking is the outcome of the Tunis phase of the Summit, which was launched in order to serve as a tool for assisting with the WSIS follow-up. The purpose of the regular reports is to update stakeholders on the various activities related to the 11 Action Lines identified in the Geneva Plan of Action, that was approved during First Phase of the WSIS.

===Platform===
The WSIS stocktaking platform is the new initiative that was launched by Mr Zhao, ITU Deputy Secretary-General and chair of ITU&#x27;s WSIS Task Force, in February 2010 to improve existing functionalities and transform the former static database into a portal to highlight ICT-related projects and initiatives in line with WSIS implementation. The platform offers stakeholders interactive networking opportunities via Web 2.0 applications. In the framework of the WSIS Stocktaking Platform, all types of stakeholders can benefit from the &quot;Global Events Calendar&quot;, &quot;Global Publication Repository&quot;, &quot;Case Studies&quot; and other components that tend to extend networking and create partnerships in order to provide more visibility and add value to projects at the local, national, regional and international levels.

Since the first edition of the &quot;WSIS Stocktaking Report&quot; was issued in 2005, biannual reporting has been a key tool for monitoring the progress of ICT initiatives and projects worldwide. The 2012 report reflects more than 1,000 recent WSIS-related activities, undertaken between May 2010 and 2012, each emphasizing the efforts deployed by stakeholders involved in the WSIS process.

===Forum and follow-up===
The WSIS follow-up works towards achieving the indicative targets, set out in the Geneva Plan of Action and serves as a global reference for improving connectivity and universal, ubiquitous, equitable, non-discriminatory and affordable access to, and use of, ICTs, considering different national circumstances, to be achieved by 2015, and to using ICTs, as a tool to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals.

Since 2006 the WSIS Forum has been held in Geneva around World Information Society Day (17 May) to implement the WSIS Follow-up. The event is organized by the WSIS facilitators including ITU, UNESCO, UNCTAD and UNDP and hosted by ITU. Until 2010 the Forum was held in ITU building and since then it has been held in International Labour Organization building. 
Every year the Forum attracts more than 1000 WSIS Stakeholders from more than 140 countries. Several high-level representatives of the wider WSIS Stakeholder community graced the Forum, and more than 20 Ministers and Deputies, several Ambassadors, CEOs, and Civil Society leaders contributed passionately towards the program of the Forum. Remote participation was an integral component of the WSIS Forum over 1000 stakeholders followed and contributed to the outcomes of the event in a remote manner from all parts of the world. Onsite networking was facilitated by the imeetYouatWSIS online community platform. More than 250 on-site participants have actively used the tool before and during the event which facilitated fruitful networking leading to win-win partnerships.

WSIS Forum meetings were held in Geneva as follows:
* WSIS Forum 2006: 9–19 May
* WSIS Forum 2007: 14–25 May
* WSIS Forum 2008: 13–23 May
* WSIS Forum 2009: 18–22 May
* WSIS Forum 2010: 10–14 May
* WSIS Forum 2011: 16–20 May
* WSIS Forum 2012: 14–18 May
* WSIS Forum 2013: 13–17 May
* WSIS+10 High-Level Event: 9 to 12 June 2014
* WSIS Forum 2015: 25–29 May 2015

===Prizes===
This initiative responds to the requests of participants of WSIS Forum 2011 for a mechanism to evaluate and reward stakeholders for the success of their efforts in implementing development-oriented strategies that leverage the power of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The first WSIS Project Prizes were awarded in 2012 and have been awarded each year thereafter.

The prizes provide a unique recognition for excellence in the implementation of WSIS outcomes. The contest is open to all stakeholders: governments, private sector, civil society, international organizations, academia, and others. The 18 prize categories are linked to the WSIS Action Lines outlined in the Geneva Plan of Action. The annual contest is organized into four phases: (1) Submission of project descriptions; (2) Voting by the members of the WSIS Stocktaking Platform; (3) Compilation of extended descriptions of the winning projects and preparation of &quot;WSIS Stocktaking: Success Stories&quot;; and (4) the WSIS Project Prize Ceremony and release of the &quot;Success Stories&quot; publication at the WSIS Forum. The WSIS Project Prizes are now an integral part of the WSIS Stocktaking Process established in 2004.

===WSIS+10===
The WSIS+10 High-Level Event, an extended version of the WSIS Forum, took place 9–13 June 2014 in Geneva, Switzerland. The event reviewed the progress made in the implementation of the WSIS outcomes under the mandates of participating agencies and took stock of developments in the last 10 years based on reports of WSIS stakeholders, including those submitted by countries, action line facilitators, and other stakeholders. The event reviewed the WSIS Outcomes (2003 and 2005) related to the WSIS Action Lines and agreed on a vision of how to proceed beyond 2015.

The WSIS+10 High-Level Event endorsed the &quot;WSIS+10 Statement on Implementation of WSIS Outcomes&quot; and the &quot;WSIS+10 Vision for WSIS Beyond 2015&quot;. These outcome documents were developed in an open and inclusive preparatory process, the WSIS+10 Multistakeholder Preparatory Platform (WSIS+10 MPP). &quot;High-Level Track Policy Statements&quot; and a &quot;Forum Track Outcome Document&quot; are also available.

The WSIS+10 open consultation process was an open and inclusive consultation among WSIS stakeholders to prepare for the WSIS + 10 High-Level Event. It focused on developing multistakeholder consensus on two draft outcome documents. Eight open consultation meetings among stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, civil society, international organizations, and relevant regional organizations, were held between July 2013 and June 2014. Two draft outcome documents were developed and submitted for consideration at the WSIS+10 High-Level Event:
# Draft WSIS+10 Statement on the Implementation of WSIS Outcomes.
# Draft WSIS+10 Vision for WSIS Beyond 2015 under mandates of participating agencies.

The final WSIS+10 High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly took place on 15–16 December 2015 in New York, and concluded with the adoption of the Outcome Document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society was adopted.

==Civil society==

A number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), scientific institutions, community media and others participated as &quot;civil society&quot; in the preparations for the summit as well as the High Level Event itself, drawing attention to human rights, people-centered development, freedom of speech and press freedom.

Youth and civil society representatives played key roles in the whole WSIS process. Young leaders from different countries, notably Nick and Alex Fielding from Canada, Tarek from Tunisia, and Mr. Zeeshan Shoki from Pakistan were the active and founding members of the Global WSIS Youth Caucus having founded youth caucuses in their home countries: Canada WSIS Youth Caucus, Tunisia WSIS Youth Caucus, and Pakistan WSIS Youth Caucus. Young leaders participated in both the Geneva and Tunis phases. Youth Day was celebrated and youth showcased their projects and organised events at the summit. Youth also participated in the preparation of the WSIS Declaration and Plan of Action.

In Germany, a WSIS working group initiated by the Network New Media and the Heinrich Böll Foundation, has been meeting continuously since mid-2002.

Similarly in Pakistan, PAK Education Society/Pakistan Development Network had taken the initiative to build Pakistan Knowledge Economy or Information Society. It has honour to be pioneer in promoting ICT in Pakistan and was the only Pakistani NGO who participated in UN World Summit on Information Society, Geneva and also organised Seminar at ICT4 Development Platform. The Idea of Third World Silicon Valley was also conceptualised.

One of the most significant results of civil society participation in the WSIS first phase was the insertion, in the final declaration signed by the nation&#x27;s delegates, of the clear distinction between three societal model of digitally-driven increase in awareness : proprietary, open-source and free software based models. It is the result of the work led by Francis Muguet as co-chair of Patent, Copyrights and Trademark working group.

Some civil society groups expressed alarm that the 2005 phase of the WSIS was being held in Tunisia, a country with serious human rights violations. A fact-finding mission to Tunisia in January 2005 by the Tunisia Monitoring Group (TMG), a coalition of 14 members of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, found serious cause for concern about the current state of freedom of expression and of civil liberties in the country, including gross restrictions on freedom of the press, media, publishing and the Internet.

The coalition published a 60-page report that recommends steps the Tunisian government needs to take to bring the country in line with international human rights standards. At the third WSIS Preparatory Committee meeting in Geneva in September 2005, the TMG launched an update to the report that found no improvements in the human rights situation.

The Digital Solidarity Fund, an independent body aiming to reduce the digital divide, was established following discussions which took place during the Tunis summit in 2005.

==Digital divide and digital dilemma==
Two main concerns seemed to be the issue and talk of the UN World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis, (i) the digital divide and (ii) the digital dilemma.

First the digital divide, which was addressed in Archbishop John P. Foley&#x27;s address before the WSIS and in the Vatican document, &quot;Ethics in the Internet&quot;. According to Archbishop Foley the digital divide is the current disparity in the access to digital communications between developed and developing countries and it requires the joint effort of the entire international community. The digital divide is considered a form of discrimination dividing the rich and the poor, both within and among nations, on the basis of access, or lack of access, to the new information technology. It is an updated version of an older gap that has always existed between the information rich and the information poor. The term digital divide underlines the reality that not only individuals and groups but also nations must have access to the new technology in order to share in the promised benefits of globalization and not fall behind other nations.

In a statement delivered by Senator Burchell Whiteman from Jamaica he stressed that Jamaica realizes the importance of bridging the digital divide which he sees as promoting social and economic development for 80% of the countries that are still struggling with this gap and the impact that it has on them. In a statement given by Mr. Ignacio Gonzalez Planas, who is the minister of Informatics and Communications of the Republic of Cuba, he also talked about the concern of only a few countries enjoying these privileges. Mentioning that over half of the world population does not have telephone access, which was invented more than a century ago. A statement by Vice Premier Huang Ju, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, said that the information society should be a people centered society in which all peoples and all countries share the benefit to the fullest in greater common development in the information society.

Second the digital dilemma, which the Holy See emphasized as a disadvantage to the information society and urged caution to avoid taking the wrong steps. It is a real and present danger with technology especially the Internet. The Holy See strongly supports freedom of expression and the free exchange of ideas, but argues that the moral order and common good must be respected. One must approach it with sensitivity and respect for other people&#x27;s values and beliefs and protect the distinctiveness of cultures and the underlying unity of the human family.

Whiteman from Jamaica agreed on the issue of facing digital dilemmas as well. He stated that information resources combined with technology resources are available to the world and they have the power to transform the world for good or ill. In a statement made by Mr. Stjepan Mesic, President of Croatia, it was stated that we are flooded with data and we think that we know and can find everything about everyone but we also must remember that we don&#x27;t know what so easily accessible is like. He states that although the information society is a blessing one should not ignore the potentiality of it turning into a nightmare.

The Holy See&#x27;s caution of the information society is being heard and echoed by other countries especially those that were present at the WSIS in Tunis. Echoing the statement made in &quot;Ethics in the Internet&quot;, &quot;The internet can make an enormously valuable contribution to human life. It can foster prosperity and peace, intellectual and aesthetic growth, mutual understanding among peoples and nations on a global scale.&quot;

In a press statement released 14 November 2003 the Civil Society group warned about a deadlock, already setting in on the very first article of the declaration, where governments are not able to agree on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the common foundation of the summit declaration. It identified two main problems:

# On the issue of correcting imbalances in riches, rights and power, governments do not agree on even the principle of a financial effort to overcome the so-called &quot;digital divide&quot;, which was precisely the objective when the summit process was started in 2001.
# In its view, not even the basis of human life in dignity and equality, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, finds support as the basis for the Information Society. Governments are not able to agree on a commitment to basic human right standards as the basis for the Information Society, most prominent in this case being the freedom of expression.

The &quot;digital divide&quot; concept was criticized by some civil society groups as well. For instance, the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII) rejected the term.

==Internet governance==
The Summit&#x27;s first phase took place in December 2003 in Geneva. The summit process began with the first &quot;Prepcom&quot; in July 2002. The last Prepcom, held from 19 to 30 September 2005 in Geneva, ended without securing final agreement on Internet governance, with the U.S. rejecting a European Union proposal to relinquish control of ICANN.

An issue that emerged was Internet governance and the dominant role that the USA plays in policy making. The most radical ideas about devolving this authority were those supporting a civil society approach to Internet governance.

In a document released on 3 December 2003 the United States delegation to the WSIS advocated a strong private sector and rule of law as the critical foundations for development of national information and communication technologies (ICT). Ambassador David Gross, the US coordinator for international communications and information policy, outlined what he called &quot;the three pillars&quot; of the US position in a briefing to reporters 3 December.

#As nations attempt to build a sustainable ICT sector, commitment to the private sector and rule of law must be emphasized, Gross said, &quot;so that countries can attract the necessary private investment to create the infrastructure.&quot;
#A second important pillar of the US position was the need for content creation and intellectual property rights protection in order to inspire ongoing content development.
#Ensuring security on the internet, in electronic communications and in electronic commerce was the third major priority for the US. &quot;All of this works and is exciting for people as long as people feel that the networks are secure from cyber attacks, secure in terms of their privacy,&quot; Gross said.

As the Geneva phase of the meeting drew closer, one proposal that was gaining attention was to create an international fund to provide increased financial resources to help lesser-developed nations expand their ICT sectors. The &quot;voluntary digital solidarity fund&quot; was a proposal put forth by the president of Senegal, but it was not one that the United States could currently endorse, Gross said.

Gross said the United States was also achieving broad consensus on the principle that a &quot;culture of cybersecurity&quot; must develop in national ICT policies to continue growth and expansion in this area. He said the last few years had been marked by considerable progress as nations update their laws to address the galloping criminal threats in cyberspace. &quot;There&#x27;s capacity-building for countries to be able to criminalize those activities that occur within their borders...and similarly to work internationally to communicate between administrations of law enforcement to track down people who are acting in ways that are unlawful,&quot; Gross said.

Many governments are very concerned that various groups use U.S.-based servers to spread anti-semitic, nationalist, or regime critical messages. This controversy is a consequence of the American position on free speech which does not consider speech as criminal without direct appeals to violence. The United States argues that giving the control of Internet domain names to international bureaucrats and governments may lead to massive censorship that could destroy the freedom of the Internet as a public space.

Ultimately, the US Department of Commerce made it clear it intends to retain control of the Internet&#x27;s root servers indefinitely.

The main UN level body in this field is the Internet Governance Forum, which was established in 2006.

==Selected media responses==

A report by Brenda Zulu for &quot;The Times of Zambia&quot; explained that the (Dakar) resolution &quot;generated a lot of discussion since it was very different from the Accra resolution, which advocated change from the status quo where Zambia participated in the Africa WSIS in Accra. The Dakar resolutions, in the main, advocated the status quo although it did not refer to internationalization of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).&quot;

&quot;The Jamaica Observer&quot; had a column which saw Cyberspace as backyard for the new &#x27;Monroe Doctrine&#x27;. The Monroe Doctrine, expressed in 1823, proclaimed that the Americas should be closed to future European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries&#x27; affairs. The Doctrine was conceived by its authors, especially John Quincy Adams, as a proclamation by the United States of moral opposition to colonialism, but has subsequently been re-interpreted in a wide variety of ways, including by President Theodore Roosevelt as a license for the U.S. to practice its own form of colonialism.

From India, The Financial Express interviewed Nitin Desai, who is special advisor to the United Nations Secretary General. Desai is quoted saying, &quot;Our main goal is to find ways for developing countries to gain better access to the Internet and information and communication technologies (ICTs), helping them improve their life standards right from their knowledge base to their work culture, and spread awareness about diseases and other crucial issues. This will aim to bridge the huge communication technology and infrastructure gap existing currently in the world. This will include connecting villages, community access points, schools and universities, research centers, libraries, health centers and hospitals, and local and central government departments. Besides looking at the first two years of implementation of the Plan of Action after the Geneva summit, the Tunis episode will seek to encourage the development of content meant to empower the nations.&quot;

The Association for Progressive Communications criticizes Desai&#x27;s view: &quot;He says: &#x27;The way India has made use of IT, fetching the country not only profits, but a huge percentage of employed people, it has been really impressive.&#x27; My view: it&#x27;s a shame that we in India have so many IT professionals, but these skills get used so much for the export-dollar, and hardly at all (except in a spillover manner) to tackle the huge issues that a billion seeking a better life have to daily deal with.&quot;

The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), had a Reuters report titled &#x27;Rights groups says Tunisia is not right for WSIS&#x27;, citing the position of the IFEX Tunisia Monitoring Group. It said:

<doc id="274330" wikidata="Q7442149" url="?curid=274330" title="Seattle Pilots">
<text>The Seattle Pilots were an American professional baseball team based in Seattle, Washington, during the 1969 Major League Baseball season. During their single-season existence, the Pilots played their home games at Sick&#x27;s Stadium and were a member of the West Division of Major League Baseball&#x27;s American League. In their lone season in Seattle, the team finished in last place with a 64–98 record. On April 1, 1970, the franchise moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Brewers. Following the relocation, Seattle and King County sued the American League, which led the league to grant Seattle a new expansion franchise, the Seattle Mariners.

==Formation==
The lead man for the franchise ownership, Pacific Northwest Sports, Inc. (PNSI), was Dewey Soriano, a former Rainiers pitcher and general manager and former president of the Pacific Coast League. The team&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Pilots&quot; came from Soriano&#x27;s part-time job as a harbor pilot and the city&#x27;s association with the aviation industry. The team colors were royal blue and gold (with accessory red in the logo: helm and baseball seams). 

Seattle had long been a hotbed for minor league baseball and was home to the Seattle Rainiers, one of the pillars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). At the time, Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast. The then-Cleveland Indians (now Guardians) briefly considered a move to Seattle in 1964 but opted to stay in the city. In 1967, Charles Finley looked to move his Kansas City Athletics to Seattle, but ended up moving the Athletics to Oakland, California instead. There was no real competition from other professional teams at the time in the city. While Seattle had landed the National Basketball Association (NBA)&#x27;s SuperSonics (now the Oklahoma City Thunder) in 1967, the NBA was not as popular as baseball was at the time. The NFL would come to the city in 1976 with the addition of the expansion Seahawks, followed by the NHL in 2021 with the addition of the expansion Kraken.

In an ominous sign of things to come, Soriano found himself short of cash after making little effort to find locally-based partners. He had to ask William R. Daley, who owned the Indians during the time they flirted with moving to Seattle, to underwrite much of the purchase price. In return, Soriano sold Daley 47% of the stock. Daley became the team&#x27;s largest shareholder and chairman of the board, while Soriano remained team president.

A couple of factors were beyond the Pilots&#x27; control. They were originally not set to start play until along with the Kansas City Royals. However, the date was moved up to under pressure from Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri. Professional baseball had been played in Kansas City in one form or another from until the A&#x27;s left for Oakland after the season, and Symington would not accept the prospect of Kansas City having to wait three years for baseball to return there. The American League would not allow only one new team to enter the league, as the resulting odd number of teams would unbalance the schedule. That meant that Kansas City and Seattle had to be admitted together.

Despite Soriano having been president of the PCL, he had to pay the PCL $1 million to compensate for the loss of one of its longest-standing and most successful franchises. After King County voters approved a bond for a domed stadium (what would become the Kingdome) in February 1968 with 62 percent in favor, the Seattle Pilots were officially born. California Angels executive Marvin Milkes was hired as general manager, and Joe Schultz, a coach with the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals, became manager.

==Team issues==

With expansion to twelve teams in each league came a realignment into two divisions. Unlike the National League, the AL owners voted to align strictly based on geography. On paper, the newly-formed American League West was by far the weaker division, as it consisted of the two expansion teams and the four clubs that had finished sixth through ninth place in the 1968 campaign. The Oakland Athletics were the only AL West team that had a winning record in 1968, finishing 82-80.

Due to the favorable alignment, Schultz and Milkes both optimistically predicted that the Pilots could finish third in the new division. However, the Pilots experienced the typical struggles of a first-year expansion team. They won their first game, and then their home opener three days later, but only won five more times in the first month. Nevertheless, the Pilots stayed within striking distance of .500 for much of the spring, and were only six games out of the AL West lead as late as June 28. But a disastrous 9–20 July ended even a faint hope of any kind of contention, though they were still in third place as late as August. However, a 6–22 August sent them into the AL West basement for good. The team finished the season with a record of 64–98, 33 games behind division winner Minnesota and five games behind their expansion brethren, the Royals. Only Cleveland had a worse record in the American League. On the plus side, they did finish 12 games ahead of the two National League expansion teams, Montreal and San Diego, both of whom lost 110 games.

However, the team&#x27;s poor play was the least of its troubles. The most obvious problem was Sick&#x27;s Stadium. The longtime home of the Rainiers, it had once been considered one of the best ballparks in minor league baseball. However, in 1964, the Rainiers sold the stadium to the city, which was more interested in building a freeway on the stadium site than maintaining it. Indeed, both the Indians and A&#x27;s had balked at moving to Seattle because of Sick&#x27;s rapid deterioration. While a condition of awarding the Pilots to Seattle was that Sicks&#x27; had to be expanded to 30,000 seats, work did not really begin in earnest until January 1969. Only 18,000-19,500 seats (depending on the source) were ready by Opening Day because of numerous delays. The scoreboard was not even ready until the night before the season opener. By June there were finally 25,000 seats in place. Water pressure was almost nonexistent after the seventh inning, especially with crowds above 8,000.

The Pilots had a total attendance of 677,944 people for the season, 20th out of 24 teams in Major League Baseball, and their average attendance per game, 8,268, was also 20th. Seattle finished above fellow cellar dweller teams like the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, and the expansion San Diego Padres. The other two expansion teams outdrew the Pilots, with the Kansas City Royals having 902,414 attend their games while the Montreal Expos finished 10th in attendance with 1,212,608. The highest attendance for a Pilots home game was 23,657, on August 3 against the New York Yankees. The lowest attendance for a Pilot home game was on April 29, their 17th game, when a reported 1,954 fans showed up to watch them play the California Angels. The Pilots lost several hundred thousand dollars their first and only season. The team&#x27;s new stadium was slated to be built at the Seattle Center, but a petition by stadium opponents ground the project to a halt. The project was later moved to south of downtown and developed for the Kingdome.

Additionally, the Pilots were severely underfinanced. The Sorianos were forced to bring Daley into their group after making almost no effort to court Seattle-based partners. However, the American League did not even consider any other prospective owners. When league president Joe Cronin scouted out the city in 1967, his only interview was with Soriano. Despite their straitened financial condition, the Sorianos balked at corporate support, a critical factor even in those days for sports franchises.

==Relocation==
By the end of the season, the Pilots were gasping. However, Daley refused to put up more financing. It was obvious that they would not survive long enough to move into their new park without new ownership. It was also obvious that the timetable for a new stadium would have to be significantly advanced, as Sicks&#x27; Stadium was inadequate even for temporary use.

It turned out both the league and commissioner&#x27;s offices were concerned about the Pilots&#x27; viability as well. As early as June, an MLB memo envisaged the Pilots moving to Milwaukee. During the offseason, Soriano made contact with car salesman and former Milwaukee Braves minority owner Bud Selig, who was leading the effort to bring major league baseball back to Milwaukee. They met in secret for over a month towards the end of the season, and during Game 1 of the World Series, Soriano agreed to sell the Pilots to Selig for $10.8 million. Selig would then move the team to Milwaukee. However, the remaining owners of the Pilots turned it down in the face of pressure from Washington&#x27;s two senators, Warren Magnuson and Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, as well as state attorney general Slade Gorton. 

Local theater chain owner Fred Danz, restaurateur Dave Cohn, and Westin Hotels head Eddie Carlson came forward with an offer to buy out the Sorianos and reduce Daley&#x27;s stake to 30 percent. The $10 million deal received preliminary approval in December. However, the deal fizzled when it emerged that three months earlier, the Bank of California had called in a $4 million loan (or $3.5 million, depending on the source) it made to the Soriano-Daley group to finance the purchase of the franchise. No one in the American League knew that the loan had even existed. Faced with having to raise more money than expected, Danz walked away. In January 1970, Carlson put together a nonprofit group, modeled loosely on the ownership structure of the National Football League&#x27;s Green Bay Packers, to buy the team. However, the other American League owners rejected the idea almost out of hand. Chicago White Sox owner John Allyn expressed the concerns of the owners when he said that under Carlson&#x27;s plan, &quot;no one person, group, or firm&quot; would be responsible for team expenses. The owners also feared it would devalue the other clubs&#x27; worth. A slightly modified deal came one vote short of approval.

==Bankruptcy==

After a winter and spring full of court action, the owners loaned Soriano and Daley $650,000 to send the team to spring training and settle the Pilots&#x27; most immediate debts. Under new manager Dave Bristol, the Pilots arrived for spring training in Tempe, Arizona unsure of where they would play. However, Soriano and Daley declared bankruptcy, claiming that the loan was not enough to keep the team alive. The league stripped Soriano and Daley of their authority over the Pilots and took control of the team.

Soon afterward, the league gave tentative approval to sell the Pilots to Selig&#x27;s Milwaukee group, but final approval was delayed due to the state seeking an injunction to stop the sale. PNSI&#x27;s bankruptcy filing, however, was intended to forestall post-sale legal action. At the bankruptcy hearing a week later, Milkes testified there was not enough money to pay the coaches, players, and office staff. Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players, they would have all become free agents and the AL would have been reduced to nine teams for the season, which would have left the schedule in chaos. With this in mind and with no credible alternatives to Selig&#x27;s offer, Federal Bankruptcy Referee Sidney C. Volinn declared the Pilots bankrupt on March 31—seven days before Opening Day—clearing the way for them to move to Milwaukee. The team&#x27;s equipment had been sitting in Provo, Utah, with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward Seattle or Milwaukee. 

Selig intended to change the team&#x27;s colors to navy and red in honor of the minor-league Brewers of his youth. Instead, due to the move being finalized at such a late date, the Brewers were stuck using old blue and gold Pilots&#x27; uniforms, with the team name replaced. Blue and gold remain the Brewers&#x27; colors today although the shades have been darker since 2000. The move also came too late for Topps to change its baseball cards for the 1970 season, so the 1970 Topps set has cards for the Pilots.

==&quot;Ball Four&quot;==
Jim Bouton was a Pilots relief pitcher through most of 1969, after the team bought his contract from the New York Yankees in mid-1968. His book &quot;Ball Four&quot; is based on a journal that he kept during the 1969 season. Bouton spent most of the season with Seattle, although he was traded to the Houston Astros in late August.

==Lawsuit and enfranchisement of the Seattle Mariners==
In 1970, in the aftermath of the Pilots&#x27; purchase and relocation to Milwaukee, the City of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington (represented by then-State Attorney General Slade Gorton) sued the American League for breach of contract. Confident that Major League Baseball would return to Seattle within a few years, King County built the multi-purpose Kingdome, which would become home to the NFL&#x27;s expansion Seattle Seahawks in . The construction of the Kingdome had originally been approved by area voters as a condition of getting the Pilots, but hadn&#x27;t begun prior to the Pilots leaving for Milwaukee. 

The Pilots lawsuit continued until 1976. At trial, the American League offered to give Seattle an expansion baseball franchise in return for dropping the suit, and details were ironed out over the next year. To keep the league with an even number of teams, a formal expansion proceeding was held, with a second team, the Blue Jays, being awarded to the city of Toronto (also allowing both leagues to place a team in Canada, the National League&#x27;s Montreal Expos [now the Washington Nationals] having been established in 1969). The new Seattle team, to begin play in , would be owned by a consortium led by entertainer Danny Kaye, along with Stanley Golub, Walter Schoenfeld, Lester Smith, James Stillwell, Jr. and James A. Walsh. Seattle&#x27;s new team would be known as the Mariners and would initially incorporate the same blue and gold colors used by the Pilots. Since 1993, the team&#x27;s colors have been navy blue, teal, and silver.

<text>The Kansas City Athletics were a Major League Baseball team that played in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1955 to 1967, having previously played in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the Philadelphia Athletics. After moving in 1967, the team became the Oakland Athletics. The team is now known as the Athletics; they will play in West Sacramento, California, for the 2025–2027 seasons before a planned relocation to the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

The Kansas City franchise played at Municipal Stadium from 1955 to 1967.

The Kansas City Athletics had an overall win–loss record of during their 13 years in Kansas City. One Kansas City Athletics player was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Reggie Jackson.

==History==
===Relocation from Philadelphia===
In 1954, Chicago real estate magnate Arnold Johnson bought the Philadelphia Athletics and moved them to Kansas City, Missouri. Although he was initially viewed as a hero for making Kansas City a major-league town, it soon became apparent that he was motivated more by profit than any particular regard for the baseball fans of Kansas City. He had long been a business associate of New York Yankees owners Dan Topping, Larry MacPhail, and Del Webb, and had even bought Yankee Stadium in 1953, though the league owners forced Johnson to sell the property before acquiring the Athletics. Johnson had also bought Blues Stadium in Kansas City, home of the Yankees&#x27; top Triple A level Minor league baseball farm team, the Kansas City Blues of the second American Association. After Johnson got permission from the American League to move the A&#x27;s to Kansas City, he sold Blues Stadium to the city, which renamed it Kansas City Municipal Stadium and leased it back to Johnson. The lease gave Johnson a three-year escape clause if the team failed to draw one million or more customers per season. The subsequent lease signed in 1960 contained an escape clause that lowered that threshold to 850,000 per season.

Normally, Johnson would have had to pay the Yankees an indemnity for moving to Kansas City, and also would have had to reimburse the Yankees for the costs they incurred for moving the Blues to Denver as the Denver Bears to make way for the A&#x27;s. Major-league rules of the time gave the Yankees the major-league rights to Kansas City. However, the Yankees waived these payments as soon as the purchase was approved. Even though the Yankees had no intention of going anywhere, the waivers led to rumors of collusion between Johnson and the Yankees. The rumors grew louder due to the Yankees&#x27; thinly concealed support for the sale, to the point of planting rumors in the press to derail an 11th-hour attempt to keep the A&#x27;s in Philadelphia.

===1955–1960: Johnson era===
Rumors abounded that Johnson&#x27;s real motive was to operate the Athletics in Kansas City for a few years, then move the team to Los Angeles (the Brooklyn Dodgers would later move there after the 1957 season). Whatever the concern about the move to Kansas City, fans turned out in record numbers for the era. In 1955, the Kansas City Athletics drew 1,393,054 to Municipal Stadium, a club record easily surpassing the previous record of 945,076 in 1948; in fact, it was the third-highest attendance figure in the majors, behind only the all-powerful Yankees and the also recently relocated Milwaukee Braves in the National League (1953–1965). That number would never be approached again while the team was in Kansas City, and would remain the club record for attendance until 1982—the Athletics&#x27; 15th season in Oakland. The A&#x27;s of this era were barely competitive; in five years under Johnson&#x27;s ownership, the closest they got to a winning record was 1958, when they finished 73–81, eight games below .500 and 19 games out of first.

During Johnson&#x27;s tenure, virtually every good young A&#x27;s player was traded to the Yankees for aging veterans and cash. Over the years, Johnson traded such key players as Roger Maris, Bobby Shantz, Héctor López, Clete Boyer, Art Ditmar and Ralph Terry to New York; in return, he did receive some talented younger players such as Norm Siebern and Jerry Lumpe, and the cash helped the team pay the bills. However, with few exceptions, the trades were heavily weighted in favor of the Yankees and arguably helped keep the Yankee dynasty afloat. For example, ten players from the 1961 Yankees, reckoned as one of the best teams of all time, came from the A&#x27;s. This led to accusations from fans, reporters and even other teams that Johnson had reduced the A&#x27;s to a Yankee farm team at the major-league level. Bill Veeck, for instance, recalled that under Johnson, the A&#x27;s were &quot;nothing more than a loosely controlled Yankee farm club.&quot;

On the positive side, Johnson devoted attention to player development for the first time in the history of the franchise. Under longtime owner and manager Connie Mack, the A&#x27;s did not or could not spend any money building a farm system, a major reason why Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia teams fell from World Series champions to cellar-dwellers so quickly. When Johnson bought the team, the A&#x27;s only had three scouts in the entire organization. Johnson did make some improvements to the farm system, but was unwilling to pay top dollar for players that could get the A&#x27;s within sight of contention.

====1955====
In the inaugural season of the Athletics in Kansas City, under new manager Lou Boudreau, saw the team slightly improve compared to the final dismal years in Philadelphia, but still perform poorly. Prior to the June 15 trade deadline, the Athletics mostly placed in fifth or seventh place, eventually falling to a record of , in seventh place. From June 18 through the end of the season, the team would not leave sixth place, ending the season with a record, 33 games behind the New York Yankees. 

====1956====

The sophomore season of the Athletics in Kansas City saw the team slide further into mediocrity. Prior to June 27, the Athletics mostly wavered between sixth and seventh place, having a record of , in seventh place, by the June 15 trade deadline. From June 27 through the end of the season, the team would not leave last place, ending the season with a dismal record, 45 games behind the World Series winning New York Yankees. 

====1957====

The season saw the Athletics hire George Selkirk as general manager, and saw an improvement relative to their previous season, though still perform poorly. Early in the season, the team was roughly an average team, though as the season progressed, would slowly fall in the standings. From June 20 through the end of the season, the team hovered between seventh and eighth place. Prior to the August 6 game against the Chicago White Sox, the Athletics fired manager Lou Boudreau on August 6 following a record, and Harry Craft was elevated from coach to manager. Following Craft&#x27;s elevation to manager, the Athletics ended the season in seventh place, with a slightly improved record to , 38½ games behind the New York Yankees. 

====1958: Best season in Kansas City====

The season saw the best season of the Athletics while in Kansas City, although still finishing with a losing record. Prior to the All-Star break, the Athletics were somewhat competitive, mostly placing between second and third place (alternating between the Boston Red Sox), with a record of by July 10. However, the Athletics were 12½ games behind the New York Yankees, who themselves were ahead of second place by 11 games. By August, the team fell to mostly seventh place, where they would roughly stay until seasons end, with a record of , 19 games behind the World Series winning Yankees. 

====1959====

For the season, the Athletics hired Parke Carroll as their new general manager, in what would be a worse performance than the previous season. The season saw the Athletics falling and rising in the standings several times. Up to June 7, the team spent most of the season in or around fourth place, before dropping to sixth place by the June 15 trade deadline, with a record of . July would see the Athletics place at their lowest of the season in last place, but not before finishing the month in third place following an 11-game winning streak to bring the team record to and 8½ games behind on July 30. The success would not last long, as after having a great July of , what followed was a dismal August of , which saw the team fall to seventh place, and an even more dismal September of . The Athletics would remain in seventh place until the end of the season, 28 games behind the Chicago White Sox. 

====1960====

Prior to the start of the season, owner Arnold Johnson was returning from watching the Athletics in spring training when he was fatally stricken with a cerebral hemorrhage. He died in West Palm Beach, Florida on March 3, 1960, at the age of 53. His estate continued to own the team until the end of the year. 

The season saw the Athletics under new manager Bob Elliot. The team placed towards the bottom of the standings for most of the season. From May onwards, the Athletics would not place above sixth, and from August through the end of the season, the team would sit exclusively in last place, ending the season with a record, 39 games behind the New York Yankees.

===1961–1967: Finley era===
On December 19, 1960, Chicago insurance magnate Charlie Finley purchased a controlling interest in the team from Johnson&#x27;s estate after losing out to Johnson six years earlier in Philadelphia. He bought out the minority owners a year later. Finley promised the fans a new day. In a highly publicized move, he purchased a bus, pointed it in the direction of New York, and burned it to symbolize the end of the &quot;special relationship&quot; with the Yankees. He called another press conference to burn the existing lease at Municipal Stadium which included the despised &quot;escape clause&quot;. He spent over $400,000 of his own money in stadium improvements (though in 1962 the city reimbursed $300,000 of this). He introduced new uniforms which had &quot;Kansas City&quot; on the road uniforms for the first time ever and an interlocking &quot;KC&quot; on the cap. This was the first time the franchise had acknowledged its home city on its uniforms. He announced, &quot;My intentions are to keep the A&#x27;s permanently in Kansas City and build a winning ball club. I have no intention of ever moving the franchise.&quot; The fans, in turn, regarded Finley as the savior of Major League Baseball in Kansas City.

While the A&#x27;s were still dreadful in the first eight years of Finley&#x27;s ownership, he began to lay the groundwork for a future contender. Finley poured significant resources into the minor league system for the first time in the history of the franchise. By 1966, the A&#x27;s were reckoned as having the strongest farm system in the majors. He was assisted by the creation of the Major League Baseball draft in 1965, which forced young prospects to sign with the team that drafted them—at the price offered by the team—if they wanted to play professional baseball. Thus, Finley was spared from having to compete with wealthier teams for top talent. The Athletics, owners of the worst record in the American League in 1964, had the first pick in the first draft, selecting Rick Monday on June 8, 1965.

In regards to managing the team, Finley would hire general managers Pat Friday, Hank Peters, and Eddie Lopat between 1961 and 1967, though they mere figureheads. With the firing of Frank Lane in 1961, Finley effectively became the team&#x27;s de facto general manager, and would remain so for the duration of his ownership.

====1961====
In January, Charlie Finley hired Frank Lane, a veteran baseball man with a reputation as a prolific trader, as general manager. Lane began engineering trades with several other teams, including the Yankees, the bus-burning stunt notwithstanding. Finley also fired manager following the 1960 season and hired Joe Gordon as the new manager. 

The season saw the Athletics perform poorly, with their first 100+ loss season since their worst in Kansas City in 1956. Though the team performed at league average through April and May, the Athletics would begin to falter shortly after. Prior to the June 19 game, Finley fired Gordon and as manager and named Hank Bauer as player-manager. By the All-Star break, the Athletics were in last place, with a dismal record of , 23 games behind the first place Detroit Tigers. Following the July 21 game, Bauer would retire from playing and take on the manager role exclusively. August would see Finley replace Lane with Pat Friday as general manager, though his sole qualification for the job was that he managed one of Finley&#x27;s insurance offices. With the firing of Lane in 1961, Finley effectively became the team&#x27;s de facto general manager, and would remain so for the duration of his ownership. September would see the Athletics and newly created Washington Senators fight to avoid last place, but would eventually tie for ninth place, each with a record of , 47½ games behind the World Series winning New York Yankees.

====1962====
Though still a poor showing, saw the Athletics second-best season in Kansas City to date. The team hovered between seventh and eighth place through June, before dropping to ninth for most of the rest of the season. By season&#x27;s end, the Athletics finished in ninth, with a record of , 24 games behind the World Series winning New York Yankees. The poor showing led to Finley to fire manager Hank Bauer following the conclusion of the season.

====1963: Rebrand to Green, Gold, and White====

Following the firing of Hank Bauer, Finley promoted Eddie Lopat from pitching coach to manager for the season. The season started with promising results, as they were competitive with at least four other teams for first place through May, having a record on May 31, 3 games behind the Baltimore Orioles. By June 18, the team fell to eighth place, though was only 7 games behind with a record of . However, the Athletics would continue to falter for the remainder of the season, remaining roughly in eighth place through the season&#x27;s end. They&#x27;d finish in eighth place with a record of , 31½ games behind the New York Yankees. 

=====Rebrand=====

Finley made further changes to the team&#x27;s uniforms. The Philadelphia Athletics wore blue and white or black and gray outfits through most of their history; in the last years in Philadelphia and the first in Kansas City, the team used a red, white and navy-blue scheme. In 1963, Finley changed the team&#x27;s colors to &quot;Kelly Green, Fort Knox Gold and Wedding Gown White&quot;. In June 1963, Bill Bryson wrote of the uniforms,

Kelly green is the Athletics&#x27; accent color. It was more a nauseous green the players wore on their wholesome, clean-cut faces the first few times they had to appear in public looking like refugees from a softball league.

Finley replaced Mack&#x27;s elephant with a Missouri mule—not just a cartoon logo, but a real mule, which he named after himself: &quot;Charlie O, the Mule&quot;. He also began phasing out the team name &quot;Athletics&quot; in favor of simply &quot;A&#x27;s&quot;. Some of his other changes—for instance, his repeated attempts to mimic Yankee Stadium&#x27;s famous right-field &quot;home run porch&quot;—were less successful. AL President Joe Cronin ordered Finley to remove the fence which duplicated the 296-foot right-field foul line in Yankee Stadium. Smarting from this edict from the league office, Finley ordered Municipal Stadium PA announcer Jack Layton to announce, &quot;That would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium&quot;, whenever a fly ball passed the limit in Municipal Stadium&#x27;s outfield. That practice ended quickly, however, when it was apparent that other teams were hitting more &quot;would-be&quot; home runs than the A&#x27;s.

====1964====
The season would see the Athletics have their worst season in Kansas City since 1956. The team didn&#x27;t spend a single day with a positive record and were consistently towards the bottom of the standings. From May 17 on, the teams spent the rest of the season in ninth or last place. On June 11, with a dismal record of , Finley fired manager Eddie Lopat and elevated coach Mel McGaha to manager. Though the team saw a slight improvement under McGaha (his record as manager was ), the team finished in last place, with a record of , 42 games behind the New York Yankees. 

====1965====

The season saw the Athletics perform barely better than the previous season, still with a dismal performance. Finley replaced general manager Pat Friday with Hank Peters prior to the start of the season. This season would follow the trend that began the previous year of never spending a day with a positive record. With a terribly poor start of , sitting in last place by 4½ games behind the ninth place Washington Senators, manager Mel McGaha was fired following the game on May 15. Manager of the team&#x27;s Triple-A affiliate Vancouver Mounties of the Pacific Coast League, Haywood Sullivan, was promoted to manager of the major league team. Under his supervision, the team played at an improved , though the team would still barely see a day out of last place. The season ended with the Athletics in last place, with a record of , 43 games behind the Minnesota Twins.

=====Satchel Paige=====
The 1965 season is most notable for a promotional move of Finley&#x27;s. On September 25, against the Boston Red Sox, Finley invited several Negro league veterans, including Satchel Paige and Cool Papa Bell, to be introduced before the game. Paige, who was 59 at the time, had signed earlier in the month to play one game. This game would make Paige the oldest player to ever play in Major League Baseball. Paige went three scoreless innings, facing ten batters and giving up only one hit and throwing one strikeout.

====1966====
The season would see Finley replace general manager Hank Peters and manager Haywood Sullivan with Eddie Lopat and Alvin Dark, respectively. The new duo would oversee the second-best season of the Athletics in Kansas City, second only to the 1958 season. This relative success was not before starting the season with a record by May 5, which was the worst start of the Athletics tenure in Kansas City. The team spent most of the season wavering between eighth and last place, though September saw the Athletics improve to seventh place, where they finished the season. Their record was , 23 games behind the World Series winning Baltimore Orioles.

====1967====

The final season of the Athletics in Kansas City was reflective of the team&#x27;s tenure in Kansas City: that of mediocrity. From April to May, the team slowly improved from being a &quot;second division&quot; to &quot;first division&quot; team, having placed in the upper half of the league, even placing as high as third by May 25 (albeit in a three-way tie with the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox), with an record and 5½ games behind the first place Chicago White Sox. However, any sense of being competitive quickly deteriorated, as the team was in ninth place by the end of May and would exclusively place at ninth or last from June 25 on. August 6 saw the Athletics fall to last place permanently. Following the August 19 game, with a record, manager Alvin Dark was replaced by Luke Appling. Appling would oversee the team&#x27;s final 40 games with a , eventually ending the Athletics season with a record, 29½ games behind the Red Sox. 

During the World Series on October 11, Finley announced Oakland as his team&#x27;s new desired home. Just four days later, Eddie Lopat resigned as general manager, a role which would not be filled in the Athletics franchise until 1981. Three days later, the Athletics were given permission to move to Oakland for the 1968, officially marking the season as the final season of the Kansas City Athletics.

===Relocation to Oakland===
Almost as soon as the ink dried on his purchase of the Athletics, Finley began shopping the Athletics to other cities despite his promises that the A&#x27;s would remain in Kansas City. Soon after the lease-burning stunt, it was discovered that what actually burned was a blank boilerplate commercial lease available at any stationery store. The actual lease was still in force—including the escape clause. Finley later admitted that the whole thing was a publicity stunt, and he had no intention of amending the lease.

In 1961 and 1962, Finley talked to people in Dallas–Fort Worth and a four-man group appeared before American League owners, but no formal motion was put forward to move the team to Texas. In January 1964, he signed an agreement on to move the A&#x27;s to promising to change the team&#x27;s name to the &quot;Kentucky Athletics&quot;. (Other names suggested for the team were the &quot;Louisville Sluggers&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Colonels&quot;, which would have allowed the team to keep the letters &quot;KC&quot; on their uniforms.) The owners turned it down by a margin on with Finley being the only one voting Six weeks later, by the same margin, the AL owners denied Finley&#x27;s request to move the team 

These requests came as no surprise, as impending moves to these cities, as well as to Atlanta, Milwaukee, New Orleans, San Diego, and Seattle—all of which Finley had considered as new homes for the Athletics—had long been afloat. He also threatened to move the A&#x27;s to a &quot;cow pasture&quot; in Peculiar, Missouri, complete with temporary grandstands. Not surprisingly, attendance tailed off. The city rejected Finley&#x27;s offer of a two-year lease finally, American League President Joe Cronin persuaded Finley to sign a four-year lease with Municipal Stadium in 

During the World Series on October 11, 1967, Finley announced his choice of Oakland over Seattle as the team&#x27;s new home. A week later on October 18 in Chicago, AL owners at last gave him permission to move the Athletics to Oakland for the 1968 season. According to some reports, Cronin promised Finley that he could move the team after the 1967 season as an incentive to sign the new lease with Municipal Stadium. The move came in spite of approval by voters in Jackson County, Missouri of a bond issue for a brand new baseball stadium (the eventual Royals Stadium, now Kauffman Stadium) to be completed in 1973. Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri blasted Finley on the floor of the U.S. Senate, calling Oakland &quot;the luckiest city since Hiroshima&quot;.

==Legacy==
When Symington threatened to have baseball&#x27;s antitrust exemption revoked, the owners responded with a hasty round of expansion. Kansas City was awarded an American League expansion team, the Kansas City Royals. They were initially slated to begin play in , but Symington was not willing to have Kansas City wait three years for another team, and renewed his threat to have baseball&#x27;s antitrust exemption revoked unless the Royals began play in , two years earlier than originally planned.

The owners complied. Needing a twelfth team to maintain an even number of teams, the AL settled on Seattle as the home of its second expansion team, the Seattle Pilots. It soon became apparent that while Kansas City had an MLB-caliber stadium and well-capitalized ownership, Seattle had neither. The Pilots&#x27; stadium and financial problems combined to make them an unviable franchise, and they were ultimately sold and moved to Milwaukee after only one season in Seattle.

==Uniforms==
When the Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City, new owner Arnold Johnson kept the franchise&#x27;s traditional color scheme of red, white, and blue. The home uniforms was a plain white uniform with script &quot;Athletics&quot; across the chest. The road uniforms were the same save for the shirt being gray. 

Following the purchase of the team in 1960 by owner Charles O. Finley, he introduced road uniforms with &quot;Kansas City&quot; printed on them, with an interlocking &quot;KC&quot; on the cap (as opposed to the previous &quot;A&quot;). In 1963, Finley changed the team&#x27;s colors from their traditional red, white, and blue to what he termed &quot;Kelly Green, Wedding Gown White and Fort Knox Gold&quot;. It was here that he began experimenting with dramatic uniforms to match these bright colors, such as gold sleeveless tops with green undershirts and gold pants.

==Attendance==
During the Johnson years, the Athletics&#x27; home attendance averaged just under one million per season, respectable numbers for the era, especially in light of the team&#x27;s dreadful on-field performance. In contrast, during the years of Finley&#x27;s ownership, the team averaged under 680,000 per year in Kansas City. According to baseball writer Rob Neyer (a native of the Kansas City area), this was largely because Finley tried to sell baseball tickets like he sold insurance. Just before the 1960 season, he mailed brochures to 600,000 people in the area, and only made $20,000 in ticket sales. During their thirteen years in Kansas City, the Athletics&#x27; overall record was , and the best season was 1966 at 

==Notable Kansas City Athletics==

<text>Homage ( or ) is a show or demonstration of respect or dedication to someone or something, sometimes by simple declaration but often by some more oblique reference, artistic or poetic. The term is often used in the arts, where one author or artist shows respect to another by allusion or imitation; this is often spelled like and pronounced similar to the original French hommage ().

==Description==
It was originally a declaration of fealty in the feudal system – swearing that one was the man (French: &quot;homme&quot;), or subordinate, of the feudal lord. The concept then became used figuratively for an acknowledgement of quality or superiority. For example, a man might give homage to a lady, so honouring her beauty and other graces. In German scholarship, followers of a great scholar developed the custom of honouring their mentor by producing papers for a &quot;festschrift&quot; dedicated to him.

In music, homage can take the form of a composition (&quot;Homage to Paderewski&quot;), a tribute album (&quot;Homage to Charles Parker&quot;) or a sample. Digital techniques used to generate many forms of media make it easy to borrow from other works, and this remediation may be used in homage to them.

<text>Friedrich August von Alberti (September 4, 1795 – September 12, 1878) was a German geologist whose ground-breaking 1834 publication recognized the unity of the three characteristic strata that compose the sedimentary deposits of the Triassic period in Northern Europe. From the fossils contained in the three distinct layers— of red bed sandstones, capped by limestones (&quot;Muschelkalk&quot;), followed by black shales— that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, and are called the &#x27;Trias&#x27; (Latin &quot;trias&quot; meaning triad), Alberti detected that they formed a single stratigraphic formation; today it would be termed a &quot;system&quot;. He identified the Triassic as bearing a unique fossil fauna, bounded by the Permian extinction below and by another extinction above.

Alberti grew up in Stuttgart and Rottweil where he was educated at the Gymnasium and went to the military school in Stuttgart. Afterwards he went back to Rottweil, a town south of Stuttgart. He learned the salt processing system and became a &quot;Salinentechniker&quot; (salt technician). He was quickly promoted to &quot;Salineninspektor&quot; (salt supervisor). In 1823, based on his perception of the area&#x27;s geology, he had an idea to drill for salt in Rottenmünster. Eight months later the team had success and found salt, in a location where no one would have considered the possibility of finding salt.

He also made excavations in the Roman ruins of Rottweil, the ancient &quot;Arae Flaviae&quot;; he published his findings from 1833 to 1837.

Alberti bought a house and lived in Rottenmünster, a former abbey 2 miles from Rottweil, from 1829 to 1853. While there he worked as manager for two salt companies. After he retired he moved to Heilbronn. He took a position as advisor, salt technician, and geologist. He had excellent skills in understanding sandstone and limestone. He discovered that if you find combinations of these two kinds of stone together, you will always find salt. He wrote books on his experiences of looking and drilling for salt.

He invented the method of mining salt by pumping water into the mine; when the brine rose to the surface, he would allow the water to evaporate and then he would collect the salt.

The Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen gave Friedrich August von Alberti an honorary doctorate for his achievements in the salt-mining industry. The city honored him with a street in his name.

Alberti was very well thought of and popular. People liked him for his personality, his happiness, and the fact that he was very open and honest to everyone. After he died his family stayed in Rottweil, where also a street bears his name. Today many of his descendants still live in the town.

In Bad Friedrichshall, also a former salt town, a school is named after him, the &quot;Friedrich-von-Alberti-Gymnasium&quot;.

<text>The picathartes, rockfowl, or bald crows are a small genus of two passerine bird species forming the family Picathartidae found in the rain-forests of tropical west and central Africa. They have unfeathered heads, and feed on insects and invertebrates picked from damp rocky areas. Both species are totally non-migratory, being dependent on a specialised rocky jungle habitat.
Both species are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The taxonomic position of the clade and its two species has been confusing. At various times, it has been grouped with the babblers, flycatchers, starlings, crows and others before being placed in a family of its own. Serle in 1952 thought it resembled the Asian genus &quot;Eupetes&quot; while Sibley used egg-albumin protein similarity, determined by electrophoresis, to suggest that it belonged to the Timaliidae. Olson revived the idea that it was related to &quot;Eupetes&quot; in 1979. A molecular sequence based study suggests that it may indeed be closely related to the crows and placed somewhere at the boundary between the Passerida and Corvida. More specifically they appear to be a sister of the rockjumpers (&quot;Chaetops&quot;) and are basal to the clade containing the Sylvioidea, Passeroidea and Muscicapoidea but outside the core Corvoidea.

This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera &quot;pica&quot; for &quot;magpie&quot; and &quot;cathartes&quot; for &quot;vulture&quot;.

=== Species ===
* White-necked rockfowl (&quot;Picathartes gymnocephalus&quot;)
* Grey-necked rockfowl (&quot;Picathartes oreas&quot;)

A possible third species may exist in Uganda, in the vicinity of the Kazinga Channel, linking Lake Edward with Lake George.

==Description==

The picathartes are large long passerines with crow-like black bills, long neck, tail, and legs. They weigh between . The strong feet and grey legs are adapted to terrestrial movement, and the family progresses through the forest with long bounds on the ground. The wings are long but are seldom used for long flights. The plumage is similar between the two species, with white breasts and bellies and darker grey and grey-black wings, backs, and tails. The neck color varies between the two species, giving them their individual names (grey-necked and white-necked picathartes). They also have bald heads with brightly coloured and patterned skin.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Rockfowl are generalised feeders, taking a wide range of invertebrate prey. Prey items include a range of insects, particularly beetles, termites, and ants, as well as millipedes, centipedes, earthworms, and gastropods. Frogs and lizards are also taken, but these are mostly fed to their chicks. Prey is taken both by foraging on the ground and in the trees. They will also forage in shallow flowing water for crabs. When foraging on the ground, they move forward with hops and bounds, then pausing to search for prey. The longish bill is used to turn over leaves and seize prey, but the feet are never used for either. Both species will follow swarms of ants in order to snatch prey fleeing the ants.

Both species of rockfowl breed seasonally in the wet season. Where an area experiences two wet seasons in a year, they will breed twice in that year. Despite reports of cooperative breeding, it is now thought that they are exclusively monogamous, breeding in pairs. They are also commonly reported to be colonial, and will breed in colonies of up to seven pairs, but solitary breeders and smaller colonies of just two pairs are more common. The nest is made of mud attached to a cave roof or overhanging rock on a cliff. The nest is a cup-like structure of dried leaves, twigs and plant fibres set into dried mud. Two eggs are laid, 24 to 48 hours apart. Both parents participate in incubating the eggs, each taking 12-hour shifts before being relieved by their partner. It takes around 20 days for the eggs to hatch. Picathartes hatchlings are altricial at hatching, almost naked (a few feathers are present on the crown and back) and helpless. The chicks take around 25 days to fledge.

==Distribution and habitat==
The rockfowl are distributed in West Africa and western Central Africa, in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana (white-necked rockfowl), Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic (grey-necked rockfowl). The rockfowl live in lowland rainforest at up to 800 m, in rocky and hilly terrain on the slopes of hills and mountains. These birds require forest litter for foraging, a large enough area to contain army-ant swarms (Dorylinae), and rocks, cliffs, or caves for nesting sites.

<doc id="274358" wikidata="Q575064" url="?curid=274358" title="Synovial membrane">
<text>The synovial membrane (also known as the synovial stratum, synovium or stratum synoviale) is a specialized connective tissue that lines the inner surface of capsules of synovial joints, tendon sheaths, and synovial bursas. It makes direct contact with the fibrous membrane on the outside surface and with the synovial fluid lubricant on the inside surface. In contact with the synovial fluid at the tissue surface are many rounded macrophage-like synovial cells (type A) and also type B cells, which are also known as fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Type A cells maintain the synovial fluid by removing wear-and-tear debris. As for the FLS, they produce hyaluronan, as well as other extracellular components in the synovial fluid.

== Structure ==
The synovial membrane is variable but often has two layers:
* The outer layer, or subintima, can be of almost any type of connective tissue – fibrous (dense collagenous type), adipose (fatty; e.g. in intra-articular fat pads) or areolar (loose collagenous type).
* The inner layer (in contact with synovial fluid), or intima, consists of a sheet of cells thinner than a piece of paper.

Where the underlying subintima is loose, the intima sits on a pliable membrane, giving rise to the term &quot;synovial membrane&quot;.

This membrane, together with the cells of the intima, provides something like an inner tube, sealing the synovial fluid from the surrounding tissue (effectively stopping the joints from being squeezed dry when subject to impact, such as running).

Just beneath the intima, most synovium has a dense net of fenestrated small blood vessels that provide nutrients not only for synovium but also for the avascular cartilage.

In any one position, much of the cartilage is close enough to get nutrition directly from the synovium.

Some areas of cartilage have to obtain nutrients indirectly and may do so either from diffusion through cartilage or possibly by &#x27;stirring&#x27; of synovial fluid.

The surface of synovium may be flat or may be covered with finger-like projections or , which, it is presumed, help to allow the soft tissue to change shape as the joint surfaces move one on another.

The synovial fluid can be thought of as a specialized fluid form of synovial extracellular matrix rather than a secretion in the usual sense. The fluid is transudative in nature which facilitates continuous exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide and metabolites between blood and synovial fluid. This is especially important since it is the major source of metabolic support for articular cartilage. Under normal conditions synovial fluid contain &lt;100/mL of leucocytes in which majority are monocytes.

=== Synovial cells ===
The intimal cells are of two types, fibroblast-like type B synovial cells and macrophage-like type A synovial cells. Surface cells have no basement membrane or junctional complexes denoting an epithelium despite superficial resemblance.
* The fibroblast-like synoviocytes (derived from mesenchyme) manufacture a long-chain sugar polymer called hyaluronan (hence rich in endoplasmic reticulum); which makes the synovial fluid &quot;ropy&quot;-like egg-white, together with a molecule called lubricin, which lubricates the joint surfaces. The water of synovial fluid is not secreted as such but is effectively trapped in the joint space by the hyaluronan.
* The macrophage-like synovial cells (derived from monocytes in blood) are responsible for the removal of undesirable substances from the synovial fluid (hence are rich in Golgi apparatus). It accounts for approximately 25% of cells lining the synovium.
== Mechanics ==

Although a biological joint can resemble a man-made joint in being a hinge or a ball and socket, the engineering problems that nature must solve are very different because the joint works within an almost completely solid structure, with no wheels or nuts and bolts.

In general, the bearing surfaces of manmade joints interlock, as in a hinge. This is rare for biological joints (although the badger&#x27;s jaw interlocks).

More often the surfaces are held together by cord-like ligaments. Virtually all the space between muscles, ligaments, bones, and cartilage is filled with pliable solid tissue. The fluid-filled gap is at most only a twentieth of a millimetre thick. This means that synovium has certain jobs to do. These may include:
# Providing a plane of separation, or disconnection, between solid tissues so that movement can occur with minimum bending of solid components. If this separation is lost, as in a &#x27;frozen shoulder&#x27;, the joint cannot move.
# Providing a packing that can change shape in whatever way is needed to allow the bearing surfaces to move on each other.
# Controlling the volume of fluid in the cavity so that it is just enough to allow the solid components to move over each other freely. This volume is normally so small that the joint is under slight suction.

== Pathology ==
Synovium can become irritated and thickened (synovitis) in conditions such as osteoarthritis, Ross River virus or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a key role in the pathogenesis of RA, and the aggressive phenotype of FLS in RA and the effect these cells have on the microenvironment in the joint can be summarized into hallmarks that distinguish them from healthy FLS. These hallmark features of FLS in RA are divided into seven cell-intrinsic hallmarks (such as reduced apoptosis and impaired contact inhibition) and four cell-extrinsic hallmarks (such as their ability to recruit and stimulate immune cells).

In general, inflamed synovium is accompanied by extra macrophage recruitment (as well as the existing type A cells), fibroblast proliferation and an influx of inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, monocytes and plasma cells. When this happens, the synovium can interfere with the normal functioning of the joint. Excessive thickened synovium, filled with cells and fibrotic collagenous tissue, can physically restrict joint movement. The synovial fibroblasts may make smaller hyaluronan so it is a less effective lubricant of the cartilage surfaces. Under stimulation from invading inflammatory cells, the synovial cells may also produce enzymes (proteinases) that can digest the cartilage extracellular matrix. Fragments of extracellular matrix can then further irritate the synovium.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;synovium&quot; is related to the word &quot;synovia&quot; in its sense meaning &quot;synovial fluid&quot;. The latter was coined by Paracelsus. More information is given at &quot;Synovial fluid § Etymology and pronunciation&quot;.

<doc id="274362" wikidata="Q1132500" url="?curid=274362" title="Core War">
<text>Core War is a 1984 programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called &quot;warriors&quot;) compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called &quot;Redcode&quot;. The standards for the language and the virtual machine were initially set by the International Core Wars Society (ICWS), but later standards were determined by community consensus.

==Gameplay==
At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction in turn. The goal of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate (which happens if they execute an invalid instruction), leaving the victorious program in sole possession of the machine.

The earliest published version of Redcode defined only eight instructions. The ICWS-86 standard increased the number to 10 while the ICWS-88 standard increased it to 11. The currently used 1994 draft standard has 16 instructions. However, Redcode supports a number of different addressing modes and (starting from the 1994 draft standard) instruction modifiers which increase the actual number of operations possible to 7168. The Redcode standard leaves the underlying instruction representation undefined and provides no means for programs to access it. Arithmetic operations may be done on the two address fields contained in each instruction, but the only operations supported on the instruction codes themselves are copying and comparing for equality.

;Constant instruction length and time: Each Redcode instruction occupies exactly one memory slot and takes exactly one cycle to execute. The rate at which a process executes instructions, however, depends on the number of other processes in the queue, as processing time is shared equally.

;Circular memory: The memory is addressed in units of one instruction. The memory space (or &quot;core&quot;) is of finite size, but only relative addressing is used, that is, address &quot;0&quot; always refers to the currently executing instruction, address &quot;1&quot; to the instruction after it, and so on. The maximum address value is set to equal one less than the number of memory locations and will wrap around if necessary. As a result, there is a one-to-one correspondence between addresses and memory locations, but it is impossible for a Redcode program to determine any absolute address. A process that encounters no invalid or jump instructions will continue executing successive instructions endlessly, eventually returning to the instruction where it started.

;Low-level multiprocessing: Instead of a single instruction pointer a Redcode simulator has a &quot;process queue&quot; for each program containing a variable number of instruction pointers which the simulator cycles through. Each program starts with only one process, but new processes may be added to the queue using the codice_1 instruction. A process dies when it executes a instruction or performs a division by zero. A program is considered dead when it has no more processes left.

;No external access: Redcode and the MARS architecture provide no input or output functions. The simulator is a closed system, with the only input being the initial values of the memory and the process queues, and the only output being the outcome of the battle, i.e., which programs had surviving processes. Of course, the simulator may still allow external inspections and modification of the memory while the simulation is running.

===Versions of Redcode===
A number of versions of Redcode exist. The earliest version described by A. K. Dewdney differs in many respects from the later standards established by the International Core War Society, and could be considered a different, albeit related, language. The form of Redcode most commonly used today is based on a draft standard submitted to the ICWS in 1994 that was never formally accepted, as the ICWS had become effectively defunct around that time. Development of Redcode, however, has continued in an informal manner, chiefly via online forums such as the codice_2 newsgroup.

===Strategy===
Warriors are commonly divided into a number of broad categories, although actual warriors may often combine the behavior of two or more of these. Three of the common strategies (&quot;replicator&quot;, &quot;scanner&quot; and &quot;bomber&quot;) are also known as paper, scissors and stone, since their performance against each other approximates that of their namesakes in the well-known playground game.

;Paper (or replicator): A replicator makes repeated copies of itself and executes them in parallel, eventually filling the entire core with copies of its code. Replicators are hard to kill, but often have difficulty killing their opponents. Replicators therefore tend to score a lot of ties, particularly against other replicators.
:A silk is a special type of very rapid replicator, named after &quot;Silk Warrior&quot; by Juha Pohjalainen. Most modern replicators are of this type. Silk replicators use parallel execution to copy their entire code with one instruction, and begin execution of the copy before it is finished.

;Scissors (or scanner): A scanner is designed to beat replicators. A scanner does not attack blindly, but tries to locate its enemy before launching a targeted attack. This makes it more effective against hard-to-kill opponents like replicators, but also leaves it vulnerable to decoys. A scanner usually bombs memory with instructions. This causes the enemy to create a huge number of processes which do nothing but create more processes, slowing down useful processes. When the enemy becomes so slow that it is unable to do anything useful, the memory is then bombed with instructions. Scanners are also generally more complex, and therefore are larger and more fragile, than other types of warriors.
:A one-shot is a very simple scanner that only scans the core until it finds the first target, and then permanently switches to an attack strategy, usually a core clear. &quot;Myrmidon&quot; by Roy van Rijn is an example of a oneshot.

;Stone (or bomber): A bomber blindly copies a &quot;bomb&quot; at regular intervals in the core, hoping to hit the enemy. The bomb is often a instruction, although other instructions, or even multi-instruction bombs, may be used. A bomber can be small and fast, and they gain an extra edge over scanning opponents since the bombs also serve as convenient distractions. Bombers are often combined with imp spirals to gain extra resiliency against replicators.

;Vampire (or pit-trapper): A vampire tries to make its opponent&#x27;s processes jump into a piece of its own code called a &quot;pit&quot;. Vampires can be based on either bombers or scanners. A major weakness of vampires is that they can be easily attacked indirectly, since they must by necessity scatter pointers to their code all over the core. Their attacks are also slow, as it takes an extra round for the processes to reach the pit. &quot;myVamp&quot; by Paulsson is an example of a vampire.

;Imp: Imps are named after the first ever published warrior, &quot;Imp&quot; by A. K. Dewdney, a trivial one-instruction mobile warrior that continually copies its sole instruction just ahead of its instruction pointer. Imps are hard to kill but next to useless for offense. Their use lies in the fact that they can easily be spawned in large numbers, and may survive even if the rest of the warriors are killed.
:An imp ring (or imp spiral) consists of imps spaced at equal intervals around the core and executing alternately. The imps at each arm of the ring/spiral copy their instructions to the next arm, where it is immediately executed again. Rings and spirals are even harder to kill than simple imps, and they even have a (small) chance of killing warriors not protected against them. The number of arms in an imp ring or spiral must be relatively prime with the size of the core.

;Quickscanner (or q-scan): A quickscanner attempts to catch its opponent early by using a very fast unrolled scanning loop. Quickscanning is an early-game strategy, and always requires some other strategy as a backup. Adding a quickscanning component to a warrior can improve its score against long warriors such as other quickscanners. However, the unrolled scan can only target a limited number of locations, and is unlikely to catch a small opponent.

;Core clear: A core clear sequentially overwrites every instruction in the core, sometimes even including itself. Core clears are not very common as stand-alone warriors, but are often used as an end-game strategy by bombers and scanners.

===&quot;Core War&quot; Programming===
With an understanding of &quot;Core War&quot; strategies, a programmer can create a warrior to achieve certain goals. Revolutionary ideas come once in a while; most of the time, however, programmers base their programs on already published warriors. Using optimizers such as OptiMax or core-step optimizer tools, a more effective warrior can be created.

Warriors can also be generated by genetic algorithms or genetic programming. Programs that integrate this evolutionary technique are known as &quot;evolvers&quot;. Several evolvers were introduced by the &quot;Core War&quot; community and tend to focus on generating warriors for smaller core settings. The latest evolver with significant success was &quot;μGP&quot; which produced some of the most successful nano and tiny warriors. Nevertheless, evolutionary strategy still needs to prove its effectiveness on larger core settings.

==Development==
&quot;Core War&quot; was inspired by a self-replicating program called Creeper and a subsequent program called Reaper that destroyed copies of Creeper. Creeper was created by Bob Thomas at BBN. Dewdney was not aware of the origin of Creeper and Reaper and refers to them as a rumor originating from Darwin and the worm experiments of Shoch and Hupp. The 1984 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article on &quot;Core War&quot; nevertheless cites the game &quot;Darwin&quot;, played by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris, and Douglas McIlroy at Bell Labs in 1961.

The word &quot;Core&quot; in the name comes from magnetic-core memory, an obsolete random-access memory technology. This term was then, and still today, typically in use as the term for working memory in working memory dumps, called core dumps, on Unix and most Unix-like systems. Additionally, the default filename used for core dumps on such systems is usually &quot;core&quot; or contains the word core.

The first description of the Redcode language was published in March 1984, in &quot;Core War Guidelines&quot; by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney. The game was introduced to the public in May 1984, in an article written by Dewdney in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Dewdney revisited &quot;Core War&quot; in his &quot;Computer Recreations&quot; column in March 1985, and again in January 1987.

The International Core Wars Society (ICWS) was founded in 1985, one year after Dewdney&#x27;s original article. The ICWS published new standards for the Redcode language in 1986 and 1988, and proposed an update in 1994 that was never formally set as the new standard. Nonetheless, the 1994 draft was commonly adopted and extended, and forms the basis of the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for Redcode today. The ICWS was directed by Mark Clarkson (1985–1987), William R. Buckley (1987–1992), and Jon Newman (1992–); currently the ICWS is defunct.

===Redcode===
0000: ADD.AB # 4, $ 3
0001: MOV.F $ 2, @ 2
0002: JMP.B $ -2, $ 0
0003: DAT.F # 0, # 0

Redcode is the programming language used in &quot;Core War&quot;. It is executed by a virtual machine known as a &quot;Memory Array Redcode Simulator&quot;, or &quot;MARS&quot;. The design of Redcode is loosely based on actual CISC assembly languages of the early 1980s, but contains several features not usually found in actual computer systems.

Both Redcode and the MARS environment are designed to provide a simple and abstract platform without the complexity of actual computers and processors. Although Redcode is meant to resemble an ordinary CISC assembly language, it is quite simplified relative to &quot;real&quot; assembly, and has no absolute memory addressing

The original 8 instructions are described as follows. Later versions added NOP, multiply and more complex comparisons.

Opcode Mnemonic Argument(s) Action 
 0 DAT B Initialize location to value B.
 1 MOV A B Move A into location B.
 2 ADD A B Add operand A to contents of location B and store result in location B.
 3 SUB A B Subtract operand A from contents of location B and store result in location B.
 4 JMP B Jump to location B.
 5 JMZ A B If operand A is 0, jump to location B; 
 otherwise continue with next instruction.
 6 DJZ A B Decrement contents of location A by 1. If location A now holds 0, jump to location B; 
 otherwise continue with next instruction. 
 7 CMP A B Compare operand A with operand B. If they are not equal, skip next instruction; 
 otherwise execute next instruction.

the ICWS &#x27;94 standard draft added more addressing modes, mostly to deal with A-field indirection, to give a total of 8 address modes:

 # — immediate 
 $ — direct (the $ may be omitted)
 * — A-field indirect
 @ — B-field indirect
 { — A-field indirect with predecrement
 &lt; — B-field indirect with predecrement
 } — A-field indirect with postincrement
 &gt; — B-field indirect with postincrement
== Implementations ==
Development of implementations of the game continued over the years by several authors. 
There are multiple versions of the game available, ported for several platforms. For instance &quot;pMARS&quot; which is open source software with source code on SourceForge, or the SDL based &quot;SDL pMARS&quot; for Windows. 

The common implementation pMars was downloaded over 35,000 times between 2000 and 2021 from SourceForge.

<doc id="274364" wikidata="Q542183" url="?curid=274364" title="Martin Guerre">
<text>Martin Guerre (), a French peasant of the 16th century, was at the centre of a famous case of imposture. Several years after Martin Guerre had left his wife, child and village, a man claiming to be him appeared. He lived with Guerre&#x27;s wife and son for three years.

The false Martin Guerre was eventually suspected of the impersonation. He was tried, discovered to be a man named Arnaud du Tilh and executed. The real Martin Guerre had returned during the trial. The case continues to be studied and dramatised to this day. The story was published many times and was spread throughout Europe.

==Historical account==

=== Life before leaving his wife ===
Martin Daguerre was born around 1524 in the Basque town of Hendaye. In 1527, his family moved to the village of Artigat in the Pyrenees of southwestern France. They changed their name to Guerre. When he was about fourteen years old, Martin married Bertrande de Rols, the daughter of a well-off family. The marriage was childless for eight years until a son, Sanxi (named after Martin&#x27;s father), was born.

Accused of stealing grain from his father, Martin abruptly disappeared in 1548. Canon law did not allow his abandoned wife to remarry.

=== Martin Guerre&#x27;s supposed return ===
In the summer of 1556, a man arrived in Artigat who claimed to be the long-gone Martin Guerre. By his similar looks and detailed knowledge of Guerre&#x27;s life, he convinced most of the villagers. Martin Guerre&#x27;s uncle and four sisters, as well as his wife Bertrande, believed the man was Guerre, as he claimed, although doubts remained.

The man who had returned as Martin Guerre lived for three years with Bertrande and her son; they had two children together, with one daughter, Bernarde, surviving. He claimed the inheritance of Guerre&#x27;s father, who had died. When he sued Guerre&#x27;s paternal uncle, Pierre Guerre, who had married Bertrande&#x27;s widowed mother during Martin Guerre&#x27;s long absence, for part of the inheritance, Pierre became suspicious. He and his wife tried to convince Bertrande that the returnee was an impostor. A soldier who passed through Artigat claimed the man was a fraud, pointing out that the true Martin had lost a leg in the ongoing war in Italy. Pierre and his sons-in-law attacked the returnee with a club, but Bertrande intervened.

In 1559, villagers accused the returnee of arson and of impersonating the real Martin Guerre. With Bertrande remaining by his side, he was acquitted in 1560.

=== Trial in Rieux ===
In the meantime, Pierre Guerre had been asking around and believed he had uncovered the identity of the impostor: Arnaud du Tilh, nicknamed &quot;Pansette&quot;, a man with a poor reputation from the nearby village of Tilh, in the region of Sajas. Pierre initiated a new case against the man by falsely claiming to act in Bertrande&#x27;s name (only the wronged wife could bring the suit). He and his wife, Bertrande&#x27;s mother, pressured Bertrande to support the charge, to which she eventually agreed.

In 1560, the case was tried in Rieux. Bertrande testified that at first she had honestly believed the man to be her husband, but that she had since realised that he was an impostor. Both Bertrande and the accused independently related an identical story about their intimate life from before 1548.

The man claiming to be Martin then challenged her: if she would swear that he was not her husband, he would gladly agree to be executed – Bertrande remained silent. After hearing from more than 150 witnesses, with many testifying they recognized Martin Guerre (including his four sisters), many others testifying to Arnaud du Tilh&#x27;s identity, and others refusing to take a side, the accused was convicted and sentenced to death by beheading.

=== Appeal and reappearance of Martin Guerre ===
The condemned man immediately appealed to the parlement of Toulouse. Officials arrested Bertrande and Pierre on charges of false accusation, and in the case of Pierre, soliciting perjury. The returnee eloquently argued his case, and the judges in Toulouse tended to believe his version of the story: that Bertrande was pressured to perjury by the greedy Pierre Guerre. The accused had to undergo detailed questioning about his past; his statements were double-checked, and no contradictions were found.

Then, dramatically, a man appeared in Toulouse during the trial, with a wooden leg, claiming to be the true Martin Guerre. When asked about the married couple&#x27;s past, the man had forgotten some details and was not able to answer the questions as well as the alleged impostor; however, when the two men were both presented to the Guerre family, the case was closed: Pierre, Bertrande, and Martin&#x27;s four sisters all agreed that the newly arrived man was the true Martin Guerre.

The impostor, who maintained his innocence, was convicted and sentenced to death for adultery and fraud; the public sentencing on 12 September 1560 was attended by Michel de Montaigne. Afterward, the condemned confessed. He revealed that he had learned about Guerre&#x27;s life after two men had confused him with Guerre, and then decided to take Guerre&#x27;s place, with two conspirators helping him with the details. He apologized to all involved, including Bertrande, for having deceived them. He was hanged in front of Martin Guerre&#x27;s house in Artigat four days later.

Guerre would end up having two more children with Bertrande before her death some time prior to the mid-1570s: Pierre and Gaspard. Guerre would remarry, and later have another son, also named Pierre, with his second wife in the mid-1570s, while Guerre himself died some time between then and 1594, when mention of the division of property to his sons was made.

=== Martin&#x27;s life during his absence===
During his long absence from Artigat, the real Martin Guerre had moved to Spain, where he served in the militia for a cardinal and subsequently in the army of Pedro de Mendoza. As part of the Spanish army, he was sent to Flanders. He was wounded in the Spanish attack on St. Quentin in 1557; his leg had to be amputated.

For years, Guerre lived in a monastery before returning to his wife and family. The reason for his return at the time of the trial is unknown. Initially, he rejected his wife&#x27;s apologies, maintaining that she should have known better than to take another man.

== Contemporary accounts and interpretations ==
Two contemporary accounts of the case were written: &quot;Histoire Admirable&quot; by Guillaume Le Sueur and the better-known &quot;Arrest Memorable&quot; by Jean de Coras, one of the trial judges in Toulouse.

In 1983, Princeton University history professor Natalie Zemon Davis published a detailed exploration of the case in her book &quot;The Return of Martin Guerre&quot;. She argued that Bertrande had silently or explicitly agreed to the fraud because she needed a husband in that society, and she was treated well by the impostor. Davis noted as evidence for this theory the improbability of a woman&#x27;s mistaking a stranger for her husband, Bertrande&#x27;s support for Arnaud until (and even partially during) the trial, and their shared story of intimacy, likely prepared in advance.

The historian Robert Finlay has criticised Davis&#x27;s conclusions, arguing that Bertrande was duped (as most of her contemporaries believed, including the trial judges) after her husband&#x27;s long absence. He thought that Davis attempted to superimpose a modern societal model of an independent woman making her own choices onto the historical account. He points to the improbability of Bertrande&#x27;s charging her own accomplice with fraud, as she would run the risk of having to defend herself against charges of adultery or false accusation.

Davis published a response to Finlay&#x27;s arguments, called &quot;On the Lame&quot;, in the same issue of &quot;The American Historical Review&quot; in June 1988.

==Literature and popular culture==
The unusual story has continued to fascinate and inspire many writers:

* Alexandre Dumas, père, included a fictional account of the events in his novel &quot;The Two Dianas&quot; as well as in his multi-volume &quot;Celebrated Crimes&quot; (1841).
* Janet Lewis&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Wife of Martin Guerre&quot; (1941) is an exploration of Bertrande and her motives for her actions.
* Philip K. Dick&#x27;s 1955 short story &quot;Human Is&quot; tells of the dilemma for the wife of a cold abusive man who returns from a mission changed for the better. The story was dramatised in the 2017 TV series &quot;Electric Dreams&quot;, which features the man on trial as an alien imposter, who is saved by the testimony of his wife.
* &quot;The Wife of Martin Guerre&quot; (1956) is an opera by the American composer William Bergsma with a libretto by Janet Lewis.
* The 1982 film &quot;The Return of Martin Guerre&quot;, directed by Daniel Vigne and starring Gérard Depardieu and Nathalie Baye, was based on the historic accounts. The screenplay added a fictional ending, including an account of Bertrande&#x27;s motives. Historian Natalie Davis (see above) served as consultant for the film.
* &quot;The True Story of Martin Guerre&quot;, a BBC Radio 4 two-part drama by Guy Meredith from the trial notes of Jean de Coras, first broadcast in June 1992 and starring Sean Bean as both Martin Guerre and the Imposter and Lesley Dunlop as Bertrande. It also uses the same fictionalized motives of Bertrande as in the Depardieu film, and was rebroadcast in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023 on BBC Radio 4 Extra.
* &quot;Sommersby&quot; (1993) was a Hollywood adaptation of the story, starring Jodie Foster and Richard Gere. It set the events in the United States during and after the American Civil War.
* The musical &quot;The House of Martin Guerre&quot; (1993) was based on the case and was first produced in Toronto.
* The musical &quot;Martin Guerre&quot; (1996), by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, premiered in London at the Prince Edward Theatre. It set the story at the time of the Massacre of St Bartholomew, during the French government&#x27;s persecution of the Huguenots. Its ending deviated from the historical account.
* &quot;Wiedersehen mit einem Fremden&quot; (&quot;The Return of a Stranger&quot;), a 2010 German TV film, directed by Niki Stein, sets the account in a village in the Black Forest after World War II. The end differs from the historic events.
* Another musical titled &quot;Martin Guerre&quot;, written by Laura Harrington and Roger Ames, was premiered at the Hartford Stage, 1993, directed by Mark Lamos and starring Judy Kuhn. It won the Connecticut &quot;Best Play&quot; award that year and had a sold-out, extended run into 1994.
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 9 episode &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; is sometimes noted for its similarities to the case, with Principal Seymour Skinner discovered to be an imposter after the real Skinner returns to Springfield. However, the episode&#x27;s writer, Ken Keeler, has stated that &quot;This episode is not – despite what people have been saying for eight years – based on or a rip-off of or a goof on the story of Martin Guerre.&quot; He said &quot;The pattern of facts is clearly the Tichborne claimant story, and not Martin Guerre.&quot;
* &quot;Beatriz&#x27;s War&quot; (2013), the first feature film produced in the country of East Timor, reprised the plot of Martin Guerre.
*Martin Guerre is mentioned in the pilot episode of the British sitcom &quot;Back&quot; (2017).
* The video game &quot;Pentiment&quot; (2022) contains a character inspired by this event, also named Martin Bauer.
* In &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (2024), Alexander Duggan goes by the username **&amp;525marTinGuerrE^$ , drawing a connection to the fact that Duggan is an imposter himself.

<doc id="274367" wikidata="Q5338269" url="?curid=274367" title="Ryōkan">
<text>(1758 – 18 February 1831) was a quiet and unconventional Sōtō Zen Buddhist monk who lived much of his life as a hermit. Ryōkan is remembered for his poetry and calligraphy, which present the essence of Zen life. He is also known by the name &quot;Ryokwan&quot; in English.

==Early life==
Ryōkan was born in the village of Izumozaki in Echigo Province (now Niigata Prefecture) in Japan to the village headman. He renounced the world at an early age to train at nearby Sōtō Zen temple Kōshō-ji, refusing to meet with or accept charity from his family. Once the Zen master Kokusen visited the temple, and Ryōkan was deeply impressed with his demeanour. He solicited permission to become Kokusen&#x27;s disciple. Kokusen accepted, and the two returned to Entsū-ji monastery in Tamashima (now Okayama Prefecture).

It was at Entsū-ji that Ryōkan attained satori and was presented with an Inka by Kokusen. Kokusen died the following year, and Ryōkan left Entsū-ji to embark on a long pilgrimage. He lived much of the rest of his monastic life as a hermit. His decision to leave Entsū-ji may have been influenced by Gentō Sokuchū, the abbot of the temple. At the time, Gentō was aggressively reforming the Sōtō school to remove perceived &#x27;foreign&#x27; elements, including kōan. The scholar Michel Mohr suggests Ryōkan may have been in disagreement with Gentō&#x27;s efforts.

==Life as a hermit==

Ryōkan spent much of his time writing poetry, doing calligraphy, and communing with nature. His poetry is often very simple and inspired by nature. He loved children, and sometimes forgot to beg for food because he was playing with the children of the nearby village. Ryōkan refused to accept any position as a priest or even as a &quot;poet.&quot; In the tradition of Zen his quotes and poems show he had a good sense of humour and didn&#x27;t take himself too seriously.
Ryōkan lived a very simple life, and stories about his kindness and generosity abound. On his deathbed, Ryōkan offered the following death poem to Teishin, his close companion:
::
::&quot;ura wo mise / omote wo misete / chiru momiji&quot;
::Now it reveals its hidden sideand now the other—thus it falls,an autumn leaf.

==Final years==
In 1826 Ryōkan became ill and was unable to continue living as a hermit. He moved into the house of one of his patrons, Kimura Motouemon, and was cared for by a young nun called Teishin. &quot;The [first] visit left them both exhilarated, and led to a close relationship that brightened Ryōkan&#x27;s final years&quot;. The two of them exchanged a series of haiku. The poems they exchanged are both lively and tender. Ryōkan died from his illness on the 6th day of the new year 1831. &quot;Teishin records that Ryōkan, seated in meditation posture, died &#x27;just as if he were falling asleep&#x27;&quot;.

==Stories of Ryōkan==

It is common practice for a monk to abstain from eating meat. Once a young monk sat to dinner with Ryōkan and watched him eat fish. When asked why, Ryōkan replied, “I eat fish when it&#x27;s offered, but I also let the fleas and flies feast on me [when sleeping at night]. Neither bothers me at all.”

It is said Ryōkan only slept with most of his body inside of a mosquito net so that he would not hurt the bugs outside.

Ryōkan was fond of rice wine and would sometimes drink it to excess. &quot;I send one of the children to buy some country wine/ And after I&#x27;m drunk, toss off a few lines of calligraphy.&quot;

Ryōkan attended the midsummer Bon Festivals. Because he was a monk, he would normally be unable to attend, but sneaked in disguised as a woman.

Ryōkan hated waste, and so any food that he was offered that he did not eat, he put into a little pot. Over time, the food rotted and became filled with maggots and other bugs. When warned against eating it, all Ryōkan said was, “No, no, it&#x27;s all right. I let the maggots escape before I eat it and it tastes just fine!”

One evening a thief visited Ryōkan&#x27;s hut at the base of the mountain only to discover there was nothing to steal. Ryōkan returned and caught him. &quot;You have come a long way to visit me,&quot; he told the prowler, &quot;and you should not return empty-handed. Please take my clothes as a gift.&quot; The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away. Ryōkan sat naked, watching the moon. &quot;Poor fellow,&quot; he mused, &quot;I wish I could have given him this beautiful moon.&quot; This story may be an interpretation of an account mentioned by Ryōkan in a haiku:
:
:&quot;nusutto ni / torinokosareshi / mado no tsuki&quot;
:&quot;The thief left it behind:&quot;
:&quot;the moon&quot;
:&quot;at my window.&quot;

<doc id="274371" wikidata="Q6056727" url="?curid=274371" title="Intersection syndrome">
<text>Intersection syndrome is a painful condition that affects the lateral side of the forearm when inflammation occurs at the intersection of the muscle bellies of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis cross over the extensor carpi radialis longus and the extensor carpi radialis brevis. These 1st and 2nd dorsal muscle compartments intersect at this location, hence the name. The mechanism of injury is usually repetitive resisted extension, as with rowing, weight lifting, or pulling.

Intersection syndrome is often confused with another condition called DeQuervain&#x27;s syndrome, which is an irritation of the thumb-sided set of tendons at the wrist, called the first dorsal compartment.

<doc id="274374" wikidata="Q31615" url="?curid=274374" title="Cove">
<text>A cove is a small bay or coastal inlet. They usually have narrow, restricted entrances, are often circular or oval, and are often situated within a larger bay. Small, narrow, sheltered bays, inlets, creeks, or recesses in a coast are often considered coves.

Colloquially, the term can be used to describe a sheltered bay. Geomorphology describes coves as precipitously walled and rounded cirque-like openings like a valley extending into or down a mountainside, or in a hollow or nook of a cliff or steep mountainside. A cove can also refer to a corner, nook, or cranny, either in a river, road, or wall, especially where the wall meets the floor.

An example is Lulworth Cove on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, England. To its west, a second cove, Stair Hole, is forming.

==Formation==

Coves are formed by differential erosion, which occurs when softer rocks are worn away faster than the harder rocks surrounding them. These rocks further erode to form a circular bay with a narrow entrance, called a &quot;cove&quot;. Another way is that waves can transport rocks and sediment towards cliffs or rock faces, which helps erode softer rock and gradually form coves due to friction. Additionally, rivers or streams that flow into the sea can contribute to creating natural harbors. &quot;Over time, the sediment carried by the flow of the water will help erode any soft, rocky areas,&quot; leading to the formation of a cove.

Historians have studied various periods in the development of the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) by reference to these &quot;generations&quot;.

==Origins and terminology==
Shortly after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, Deng Xiaoping gave a speech which referred to Mao Zedong, himself, and Jiang Zemin as the respective &quot;core&quot; of the first, second, and third generations of leadership. This method of dividing Chinese leadership generations became popular. Political scientist Joseph Fewsmith says that this division &quot;distorts history&quot; as Mao and Deng belonged to the same generation, both being veterans of the Chinese Civil War, and that Jiang could be regarded as being from the &quot;second&quot; generation.

The closest equivalent to the term &quot;leadership generation&quot; used officially in China is &quot;leadership collective&quot; (for example: &quot;first generation leadership collective&quot;). The collective is viewed as leaders of the &quot;party&quot; (the CCP) rather than of the &quot;state&quot; (the PRC). Deng used the term &quot;core&quot; to legitimize Jiang&#x27;s unexpected appointment to general secretary and to emphasize the collective nature of the leadership; Frederick Teiwes says that Deng&#x27;s application of the concept of collective leadership to the first and second generations was historically inaccurate.

Transitions between generations and core leaders is not always clear when authority is divided across generations. When Jiang became General Secretary in 1989, Deng - through enormous prestige - continued to hold unchallenged ultimate authority. Jiang, in turn, remained chairman of the Central Military Commission after being succeeded as General Secretary by &quot;fourth&quot; generation&quot; Hu Jintao. Official generational labels are not always used. The term &quot;fourth generation of leaders&quot; stopped being used officially in the summer of 2002 shortly before that generation assumed power. Similarly, &quot;fifth generation of leaders&quot; was not used officially through 2003.

The party leader (the General Secretary, and formerly Chairman) leads the collective, which typically includes the Politburo Standing Committee.

==First generation==

The first generation was drawn from the veterans of the revolutionary period, where most had either worked closely with or been in the armed forces. The close relationships and shared political-military experience made it easy for civilian leaders to intervene in military matters and vice versa, so the line between civilian and military leader was blurred even as greater specialization evolved.

Mao was the paramount leader from the founding of the PRC in 1949 until his death in 1976. His rule was unfettered by collective leadership. Mao exercised undisputed power over the party-state, including unilateral authority to decide policy, law, and political appointments. Teiwes suggests that Mao&#x27;s position was secured by being a revolutionary symbol; the other leaders could not oppose Mao without undermining their own self-image as revolutionaries.

Senior offices were predominantly held by Mao&#x27;s associates from the Long March and other civil war veterans. These included - at various times - Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Dehuai, and Lin Biao.

With the demise of Liu, Mao promoted Lin Biao as his deputy, and the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; to fill the role of his trusted allies. Lin fell out of favour, however, and died in 1971 while attempting to escape to the Soviet Union. The Gang of Four, which consisted of Jiang Qing (Madame Mao), and three other members meteorically promoted in the late 1960s, were the only members of the first generation of leadership to remain after Mao&#x27;s death in 1976. Their demise came shortly afterwards in a political coup managed by what became the second generation of leaders.

Of the other members identified above, Chen Yun was sidelined from the early 1960s, lost his party position in 1969, but survived to play an influential role in the second generation of leadership. Peng Dehuai was denounced in 1959, made a brief return to government in 1965, but was detained by Red Guards from 1966 and died in prison from torture and maltreatment in 1974. Deng Xiaoping, the core of the second generation of leadership, also played a key role in the first generation at various times, mainly as an ally of Zhou and Peng, but was purged from government in 1976 and remained sidelined at the time of Mao&#x27;s death.

==Second generation==
The death of Mao, Zhou and Zhu in 1976, and soon afterwards the coup that resulted in the arrest of the Gang of Four, ushered in the era now identified as the &quot;second generation&quot; of leaders. The era began with Hua Guofeng as the successor to Mao, but his position was soon eclipsed by the ascendancy of Deng Xiaoping as the paramount leader, in which position he remained at least until 1989 when he resigned from his leadership positions. During this period the most power and influence was held by a group of old party veterans, known as the Eight Elders, whose main members were Li Xiannian and Chen Yun, together with Deng. All of them had more than 40 years of political experience.

Thus, in official discourse, the second generation of leadership lasted from 1976 to 1992. The official discourse of the CCP today identifies Deng Xiaoping as the &quot;core&quot; of this second generation, but Deng was never formally the leader of the party during this period. Instead, the formal party leaders during this time were, successively, Hua Guofeng, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and Jiang Zemin. Other prominent leaders of this generation were Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, Ye Jianying, Peng Zhen and Wang Zhen. These leaders were also involved in the Chinese revolution, but with the exception of Deng Xiaoping, served in more junior roles, as they were all born from 1897 to 1921 (that is, some were born after the demise of the Qing Empire in the Xinhai Revolution). Like the first generation, many were educated overseas, particularly in France. Their young formative experiences were similar to the first generation. Most had some position of authority during the Cultural Revolution, although as a rule those that held power after the 1980s were purged during that decade. This generation turned the focus from class struggle and political movements to economic development and pioneering Chinese economic reform. The dominant political ideology of the era was Deng Xiaoping Theory.

The transition towards the third generation of leadership began with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The purges that followed led to the promotion of what became the third generation of leadership. Soon afterwards, Deng resigned his last major party post, as chairman of the central military committee, although he remained influential behind the scenes until his death in 1997.

==Third generation==
Between 1989 and 1992, Jiang was believed to be simply a transitional figure to protect the party from a power vacuum (or even an Eastern Bloc style collapse) until a more stable successor government to Deng Xiaoping could be put in place. Because of this, the era of the &quot;third generation&quot; is not regarded to have begun until 1992, with the election of the new CCP Politburo standing committee and Jiang consolidating his power without Deng. CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin played an important role in the period between 1989 and 2002, when as Chinese president he subverted the existing constitution and turned the presidency from a symbolic role into an executive one by his power of general secretary.

Thus, the &quot;third generation&quot; lasted from 1992 to 2002, with Jiang Zemin as core, and other leaders including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, and Li Lanqing. These leaders were born before the revolution from 1924 to 1934 but were educated afterwards before the Sino-Soviet split. Most of them received education in the Soviet Union as engineers and entered the party initially as factory managers. As a result, many of them did not wield any significant political power prior to the 1980s, spending their time during the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath working for the civil infrastructure of the state and were protected from the purges, as opposed to their predecessors. Unlike their predecessors, there is a split between the political and military leadership. Their formative experiences included the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Korean War. This generation continued economic development while China saw the emergence of various serious social issues. The political ideological innovation officially associated with this period was Jiang&#x27;s &quot;Three Represents&quot;.

The initial members of the third generation were mostly survivors from before 1989, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng (who continued as premier), Qiao Shi and Li Ruihuan. Notable changes to the leadership were the elevation of Zhu Rongji in place of Li Peng as premier in 1998 and the elevation of Hu Jintao as vice president. For the first time since 1982, the three centres of power of the presidency, the party general secretaryship and the chairmanship of the central military commission were concentrated in a single person, Jiang Zemin. This enabled him to declare himself the &quot;core&quot; of the third generation of leadership.

During this period, while Deng Xiaoping had retired from all leadership positions, he remained influential. In 1992, Deng&#x27;s informal intervention ensured that market-orientated reforms were not halted by resurgent conservative elements. (See also Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s southern tour) Deng also played an important role in nominating Hu Jintao as Jiang&#x27;s successor as party secretary.

==Fourth generation==
2002 saw the first orderly transition of power in the Chinese Communist Party in accordance with rules on term limits. The new leaders were elected to the Communist Party&#x27;s Politburo in November 2002, and took up their governmental positions in March 2003, while the most prominent of their &quot;third generation&quot; predecessors stepped down at the same time. But Hu Jintao did not become the chairman of the Central Military Commission until September 2004.

The Chinese Government considers the Hu-Wen administration to be a continuation of the Third generation, and the Xi-Li administration to be the start of the Fourth generation.

Thus, the era of the &quot;fourth generation&quot; is officially regarded to have begun in 2002, and lasted until 2012, when the next election for the party leadership occurred. The prominent leaders included Hu Jintao (as General Secretary), Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Zeng Qinghong, Huang Ju, Wu Guanzheng, Li Changchun, Luo Gan, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang, and Zhou Yongkang. It is also known as the &quot;republican generation&quot; or the Hu-Wen Administration. These were promoted to top leadership at the 16th Party Congress and remained in power until the 18th Party Congress in 2012. This generation of leaders, born mainly in the World War II years from 1939 to 1944, represented a new technocratic style governance and a less centralized political structure. The majority of this generation of leaders were engineers whose academic lives were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution and, unlike both their predecessors and likely successors, have spent very little time overseas. The dominant political ideology of this era was Hu&#x27;s Scientific Development Concept and a goal for a Socialist Harmonious Society.

==Fifth generation (current)==

The fifth generation came to power at the 18th Party Congress in 2012, when Hu Jintao stepped down as CCP General Secretary and CMC Chairman. In the fifth generation, one sees fewer engineers and more management and finance majors, including successful entrepreneurs. Most of the fifth generation of civilian leadership, born in the postwar years 1945 to 1955, were educated at top Chinese universities. Former leader Hu Jintao&#x27;s Communist Youth League faction, and the Crown Prince Party (or &quot;Princelings&quot;) are seen to be the two dominant factions within the leadership.

Following his elevation to General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, which oversees the Chinese Communist Party and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the Princeling and current CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping succeeded Hu Jintao as the paramount leader of this generation. Premier Li Keqiang took the place of former Premier Wen Jiabao and served until 2023. Others who have been top figures in the 5th generation include former Congress Chairmen Zhang Dejiang and Li Zhanshu, Conference Chairmen Yu Zhengsheng and Wang Yang, Secretariat First Secretaries Liu Yunshan and Wang Huning, former vice president and Discipline Secretary Wang Qishan, former Discipline Secretary and current Congress Chairman Zhao Leji, first Vice Premiers Zhang Gaoli and current Vice President Han Zheng, former Vice President Li Yuanchao, and its leading females, former Vice Premiers Liu Yandong and Sun Chunlan.

After the 20th CCP National Congress in 2022, the CCP Politburo Standing Committee members included Xi Jinping, Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, and Li Xi.

==Possible sixth generation==
The sixth generation of leaders had been expected to come to power at the 20th Party Congress in 2022. However, following Xi Jinping&#x27;s consolidation of power at the 19th Party Congress, the future of the &quot;sixth generation&quot; was cast into doubt as clear successor figures failed to be named to senior leadership posts, particularly the Politburo Standing Committee. Xi Jinping was re-elected as the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2022.

In preceding years, Hu Chunhua (a Vice-Premier from 2018 to 2023) was seen as a possible core figure. Hu and Sun Zhengcai were the only Politburo members named at the 18th Party Congress in 2012 who were born after 1960, making their further advancement seem like a certainty, but Sun was purged before the 19th Party Congress and Hu was dropped from the Politburo at the 20th. U.S.-based newspaper &quot;Duo Wei Times&quot; also listed four figures who have since fallen from grace, former Fujian Governor Su Shulin, former President of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court Zhou Qiang, former Heilongjiang Party Secretary Zhang Qingwei, and former Minister of Natural Resources Lu Hao, as other potential figures in this generation of leadership. Others in this rough age group ascending in the ranks include Zhang Guoqing (now a Vice-Premier) and Chen Min&#x27;er (party secretary of Chongqing and then Tianjin).

Ding Xuexiang is the only person from this age bracket to have reached the Standing Committee, but the 20th Politburo includes eight other members born between 1960 and 1964.

==Possible seventh generation==
Born in the 1970s (or in the late 1960s if loosely defined), the seventh generation of leaders includes Yin Yong, Mayor of Beijing; Zhong Shaojun, Director of the General Office of the Central Military Commission; Zhuge Yujie, Deputy Party Secretary of Hubei; , Party Secretary of Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan; and Guo Ningning, Party Secretary of Fuzhou, the provincial capital of Fujian and Executive Vice Governor of Fujian.

No leader born in the 1970s has served as a full member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. As of mid-2023, most leaders born in the 1970s served in positions at the deputy provincial-ministerial level. Only two were full provincial-ministerial leaders: Li Yunze, Director of the National Administration of Financial Regulation, and A Dong , First Secretary of the Communist Youth League of China.

<text>Hans Marsilius Purrmann (10 April 1880 – 17 April 1966) was a German artist. He was born in Speyer where he also grew up. He completed an apprenticeship as a scene painter and interior decorator, and subsequently studied in Karlsruhe and Munich before going to Paris in 1906. It was here he became a student and later a friend of Henri Matisse whom he set up a painting school with. After 1916, Purrmann lived in Berlin and Langenargen (Lake Constance), moving from there in 1935 to run the German art foundation at the Villa Romana in Florence. He lived there until 1943, then in Montagnola (Switzerland). He died in Basel. Typical of Purrmann&#x27;s style are colourful, sensitively painted landscapes, still lifes and portraits. There are large collections of his works in Langenargen Museum and in the Purrmann House, Speyer.

<text>Scott Vincent Baio (; born September 22, 1960) is an American actor. He is known for playing Chachi Arcola on the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1977–1984) and its spin-off &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot; (1982–1983), the title character on the sitcom &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; (1984–1990), Dr. Jack Stewart in the medical-mystery-drama series &quot;&quot; (1993–1995), and the title role of the musical film &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976), his onscreen debut. Baio has guest-starred on various television programs, appeared in several independent films, and starred on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;See Dad Run&quot; (2012–2014).

==Early life==
Baio was born in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough of New York City in 1960, the son of Italian immigrants Rose, a homemaker, and Mario Baio, who worked as his manager. He and his siblings were raised in Bensonhurst. He went to Xaverian High School.

==Career==
In 1976, Baio played the title character &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; in the children&#x27;s gangster musical directed by Alan Parker, which also co-starred Jodie Foster. Baio and Foster later worked together again in the teen girl drama &quot;Foxes&quot; (1980), helmed by Adrian Lyne.

When he was 16, Baio was cast as The Fonz&#x27;s cousin Chachi Arcola on &quot;Happy Days&quot;. During his time on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Baio earned two Daytime Emmy Award nominations, for his lead performances in the television movies &quot;Stoned&quot; (1981) and &quot;All the Kids Do It&quot; (1985). He won two Young Artist Awards during the Third Annual Youth in Film Awards (1980–1982) as Best Young Actor in a Television Special for &quot;Stoned&quot; and Best Young Comedian in Television or Motion Pictures for &quot;Happy Days&quot;. He also starred in the made-for-television youth drama specials &quot;The Boy Who Drank Too Much&quot; and &quot;Senior Trip&quot;.

From March 1982 to May 1983, Baio starred with his &quot;Happy Days&quot; co-star Erin Moran in the show&#x27;s spin-off, &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot;. The show was canceled after 17 episodes and Baio (and Moran) returned to &quot;Happy Days&quot;. During this period, Baio, who played an aspiring singer on &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot;, was signed to a record contract with RCA Victor, who used his TV role to push his music career. He released two albums and three singles, and his self-titled album peaked at number 181 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but his recording career never took off.

In 1982, he appeared in the film &quot;Zapped!&quot; and starred as Francis Geminiani in the special HBO presentation of &quot;Gemini&quot;, an adaptation of the Broadway comedy-drama &quot;Happy Birthday, Gemini&quot;. From 1979 to 1984, Baio made seven appearances on &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;; six as a competitor for the ABC team (once as team captain) and one as co-host. From 1984 until 1990, Baio starred in the syndicated comedy series &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;. In 1985, he was part of an ensemble cast for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, where he portrayed Pat the Pig. From 1987 through 1991, he was a director of the children&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Out of This World&quot;.

During the 1990s, Baio appeared in various television programs, including the short-lived &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; small screen spin-off &quot;Baby Talk&quot;. In 1991, he appeared in the NBC Monday Night Movie &quot;Perry Mason and the Case of the Fatal Fashion&quot;, as a young prosecutor. Between 1993 and 1995, he portrayed Dr. Jack Stewart in the medical mystery series &quot;&quot;. Baio was a guest-star on a variety of series, including &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot; and &quot;The Nanny&quot;. He also starred in several films on television and video releases such as &quot;Detonator&quot;, &quot;Bar-Hopping&quot;, &quot;Dumb Luck&quot;, &quot;Face Value&quot; and &quot;Mixed Blessings&quot;.

Baio was in the independent films &quot;Very Mean Men&quot; (2000), &quot;Face to Face&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Bread, My Sweet&quot; (2001). In 2004, Baio starred in &quot;&quot; with Bob Clark. The film was widely panned by critics and nominated for four Razzie Awards. Baio played himself in the 2005 Wes Craven film &quot;Cursed&quot;. In 2005, Baio appeared in four episodes of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as the Bluth family&#x27;s lawyer, Bob Loblaw, taking over the role from his former &quot;Happy Days&quot; co-star Henry Winkler; the Online Film and Television Association nominated him as Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for the role. In 2007, Baio starred in the VH1 celebrity reality series &quot;Scott Baio Is 45...and Single&quot; and its successor the following year, &quot;Scott Baio Is 46...and Pregnant&quot;. Baio was also the co-host of the VH1 reality show &quot;Confessions of a Teen Idol&quot;, in which former teen idols attempt to resurrect their careers.

Baio starred in and produced the Nick at Nite situation comedy &quot;See Dad Run&quot;, which ran from 2012 to 2015. Baio guest starred in a 2014 episode of &quot;Sam &amp; Cat&quot; as a police officer who arrests the title characters.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Baio got engaged to his girlfriend Jeanette Jonsson.

In 2007, shortly before the birth of their daughter, Baio married Renée Sloan, whom he met in the 1990s at the Playboy Mansion. Renée was carrying twins, but lost one of the babies in the 11th week of her pregnancy. Their daughter, Bailey, was born in 2007, five weeks premature. After Bailey tested positive for a rare metabolic disorder, the family started the Bailey Baio Angel Foundation to provide financial support to other families who are dealing with metabolic disorders. Renée Baio was diagnosed with a meningioma brain tumor in June 2015, with a second tumor discovered later. In 2017 she was also diagnosed with cerebral microvascular disease. Baio is also the stepfather to Renée&#x27;s daughter Kalyn, born in 1989.

He is a cousin of former actor Jimmy Baio, Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader, and Vampire Weekend bassist Chris Baio.

===Political views===
Baio is a registered Republican and has described his politics as conservative. He campaigned for Ronald Reagan in his youth and attended Reagan&#x27;s state funeral. Upon Reagan&#x27;s death in 2004, he was quoted by the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; as saying, &quot;President Reagan made me feel proud to be an American. Today, I feel sadness.&quot;

Baio endorsed Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016, and he spoke at the opening night of the 2016 Republican National Convention. He also supported Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

On December 15, 2016, Baio accused Nancy Mack, wife of Chad Smith, drummer for Red Hot Chili Peppers, of physically assaulting him at their children&#x27;s elementary school function. Baio claims Mack began berating and cursing him over his support of Trump and at one point attacked him, grabbing him under his arms and then shaking and pushing him. Mack claimed she was trying to show Baio how Trump hugs women and denied any intentional physical aggression.

On August 26, 2017, Baio re-tweeted a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory meme, insinuating that the 2017 killing of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville and the Sandy Hook shooting of 2012 were linked hoaxes. 

===Allegations of abuse===
On January 29, 2018, sexual misconduct allegations made by Nicole Eggert against Baio surfaced. In 2013, Eggert stated on the Nik Richie Radio show that she and Baio had a one-time encounter &quot;years&quot; after &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; ended, which would have been after 1990. In the more elaborated account, discussed on &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; and &quot;Megyn Kelly Today&quot;, Eggert claimed that Baio molested her beginning in 1986 when she was 14, and that when she was 17, she had intercourse with him. Baio contends that he had sexual relations with Eggert only once, and that the encounter occurred after she had turned 18. Baio explained that Eggert&#x27;s own words to Richie proved he did not have intercourse with Eggert while she was a minor, since the final episode of &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; aired in November 1990, ten months after Eggert turned 18. 

Several months later, Alexander Polinsky, another co-star in &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;, accused Baio of verbally abusing and physically assaulting him while on set.

<text>An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others). The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. The current de facto standard is governed by the industry group WHATWG and is known as the HTML Living Standard.

An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of a document (e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.

==Concepts==
===Elements vs. tags===
As is generally understood, the position of an element is indicated as spanning from a start tag and is terminated by an end tag. This is the case for many, but not all, elements within an HTML document. The distinction is explicitly emphasised in &quot;HTML 4.01 Specification&quot;:

Similarly the W3C Recommendation HTML 5.1 2nd Edition explicitly says:

and:

As HTML (before HTML5) is based on SGML, its parsing also depends on the Document Type Definition (DTD), specifically an HTML DTD (e.g. HTML 4.01). The DTD specifies which element types are possible (i.e. it defines the set of element types) and also the valid combinations in which they may appear in a document. It is part of general SGML behavior that, where only one valid structure is (per the DTD), its explicit statement in any given document is not generally required. As a simple example, the tag indicating the start of a paragraph element should be complemented by a tag indicating its end. But since the DTD states that paragraph elements cannot be nested, an HTML document fragment is thus inferred to be equivalent to . (If one paragraph element cannot contain another, any currently open paragraph must be closed before starting another.) Because this implication is based on the combination of the DTD and the individual document, it is not usually possible to infer elements from document tags but only by using an SGML—or HTML—aware parser with knowledge of the DTD. HTML5 creates a similar result by defining what tags can be omitted.

===SGML vs. XML===
SGML is complex, which has limited its widespread understanding and adoption. XML was developed as a simpler alternative. Although both can use the DTD to specify the supported elements and their permitted combinations as document structure, XML parsing is simpler. The relation from tags to elements is always that of parsing the actual tags included in the document, without the implied closures that are part of SGML.

HTML as used on the current web is likely to be either treated as XML, by being XHTML, or as HTML5; in either case the parsing of document tags into Document Object Model (DOM) elements is simplified compared to legacy HTML systems. Once the DOM of elements is obtained, behavior at higher levels of interface (example: screen rendering) is identical or nearly so.

===codice_1 vs. box===
Part of this CSS presentation behavior is the notion of the &quot;box model&quot;. This is applied to those elements that CSS considers to be &quot;block&quot; elements, set through the CSS declaration.

HTML also has a similar concept, although different, and the two are very frequently confused. codice_1 and codice_3 are groups within the HTML DTD that group elements as being either &quot;block-level&quot; or &quot;inline&quot;. This is used to define their nesting behavior: block-level elements cannot be placed into an inline context. This behavior cannot be changed; it is fixed in the DTD. Block and inline elements have the appropriate and different CSS behaviors attached to them by default, including the relevance of the box model for particular element types.

Note though that this CSS behavior can, and frequently is, changed from the default. Lists with are codice_1 elements and are presented as block elements by default. However, it is quite common to set these with CSS to display as an inline list.

==Overview==

===Syntax===

\mathtt{= &quot;}\!\underbrace\mathtt{paragraph}_\mathsf{\color{White}{Attr} \atop \color{Black}Attribute\ value}&quot;\mathtt{\color{BrickRed}&gt;}}^\mathsf{Start\ tag}
 \overbrace\mathtt{\color{Green}This\ is\ a\ paragraph.}^\mathsf{Content}
 \overbrace\mathtt{\color{BrickRed}&lt;\!/p\!&gt;}^\mathsf{End \atop tag}
}^\mathsf{Element}
&lt;/math&gt;
In the HTML syntax, most elements are written with a start tag and an end tag, with the content in between. An HTML tag is composed of the name of the element, surrounded by angle brackets. An end tag also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the element, would be written as:

&lt;p&gt;In the HTML syntax, most elements are written ...&lt;/p&gt;

However, not all of these elements the end tag, or even the start tag, to be present. Some elements, the so-called &quot;void elements&quot;, do not have an end tag. A typical example is the (hard line-break) element. A void element&#x27;s behavior is predefined, and it cannot contain any content or other elements. For example, an address would be written as:

&lt;p&gt;P. Sherman&lt;br&gt;42 Wallaby Way&lt;br&gt;Sydney&lt;/p&gt;

When using XHTML, it is required to open and close all elements, including void elements. This can be done by placing an end tag immediately after the start tag, but this is not legal in HTML 5 and will lead to two elements being created. An alternative way to specify that it is a void element, which is compatible with both XHTML and HTML 5, is to put a codice_5 at the of the tag (not to be confused with the codice_5 at the of a closing tag).

&lt;p&gt;P. Sherman&lt;br /&gt;42 Wallaby Way&lt;br /&gt;Sydney&lt;/p&gt;
HTML attributes are specified inside the start tag. For example, the element, which represents an abbreviation, expects a codice_7 attribute within its opening tag. This would be written as:

&lt;abbr title=&quot;abbreviation&quot;&gt;abbr.&lt;/abbr&gt;
Informally, HTML elements are sometimes referred to as &quot;tags&quot; (an example of synecdoche), though many prefer the term &quot;tag&quot; strictly in reference to the markup delimiting the start and end of an element.

Element (and attribute) names may be written in any combination of upper or lower case in HTML, but must be in lower case in XHTML. The canonical form was upper-case until HTML 4, and was used in HTML specifications, but in recent years, lower-case has become more common.

==== Types of element ====
There are three kinds of HTML elements: normal elements, raw text elements, and void elements.

 usually have both a start tag and an end tag, although for some elements the end tag, or both tags, can be omitted. It is constructed in a similar way:
* a &quot;start tag&quot; () marking the beginning of an element, which may incorporate any number of HTML attributes;
* some amount of &quot;content&quot;, including text and other elements;
* an &quot;end tag&quot;, in which the element name is prefixed with a slash: .

 (also known as text or text-only elements) are constructed with:
* a &quot;start tag&quot; (in the form ) marking the beginning of an element, which may incorporate any number of HTML attributes;
* some amount of text &quot;content&quot;, but no elements (all tags, apart from the applicable end tag, will be interpreted as content);
* an &quot;end tag&quot;, in which the element name is prefixed with a slash: . In some versions of HTML, the end tag is optional for some elements. The end tag is required in XHTML.
An example is the element, which must not contain other elements (including markup of text), only text.

 (also sometimes called empty elements, single elements or stand-alone elements) only have a start tag (in the form ), which contains any HTML attributes. They may not contain any children, such as text or other elements. For compatibility with XHTML, the HTML specification allows an optional space and slash ( is permissible). The slash is required in XHTML and other XML applications. Two common void elements are (for a hard line-break, such as in a poem or an address) and (for a thematic break). Other such elements are often place-holders which reference external files, such as the image () element. The attributes included in the element will then point to the external file in question. Another example of a void element is , for which the syntax is:

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;fancy.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;

This element points the browser at a style sheet to use when presenting the HTML document to the user. In the HTML syntax attributes do not have to be quoted if they are composed only of certain characters: letters, digits, the hyphen-minus and the period. When using the XML syntax (XHTML), on the other hand, all attributes must be quoted, and a spaced trailing slash is required before the last angle bracket:

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;fancy.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
==== Attributes ====
HTML attributes define desired behavior or indicate additional element properties. Most attributes require a &quot;value&quot;. In HTML, the value can be left unquoted if it does not include spaces (codice_8), or it can be quoted with single or double quotes (codice_9 or codice_10). In XML, those quotes are required.

Boolean attributes, on the other hand, do not require a value to be specified. An example is the codice_11 for checkboxes:

&lt;input type=checkbox checked&gt;

In the XML (and thus XHTML) syntax, though, a value is required, and the name should be repeated as the value:

&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;
===Element standards===

HTML elements are defined in a series of freely available open standards issued since 1995, initially by the IETF and subsequently by the W3C.

During the browser wars of the 1990s, developers of user agents (e.g. web browsers) often developed their own elements, some of which have been adopted in later standards. Other user agents may not recognize non-standard elements, and they will be ignored, possibly causing the page to be displayed improperly.

In 1998, XML (a simplified form of SGML) introduced mechanisms to allow anyone to develop their own elements and incorporate them in XHTML documents, for use with XML-aware user agents.

Subsequently, HTML 4.01 was rewritten in an XML-compatible form, XHTML 1.0 (&quot;eXtensible HTML&quot;). The elements in each are identical, and in most cases valid XHTML 1.0 documents will be valid or nearly valid HTML 4.01 documents. This article mainly focuses on real HTML, unless noted otherwise; however, it remains applicable to XHTML. See HTML for a discussion of the minor differences between the two.

===Element status===
Since the first version of HTML, several elements have become outmoded, and are &quot;deprecated&quot; in later standards, or do not appear at all, in which case they are &quot;invalid&quot; (and will be found invalid, and perhaps not displayed, by validating user agents).

In HTML 4.01 / XHTML 1.0, the status of elements is complicated by the existence of three types of DTD:
* Transitional, which contain deprecated elements, but which were intended to provide a transitional period during which authors could update their practices;
* Frameset, which are versions of the Transitional DTDs which also allow authors to write frameset documents;
* Strict, which is the up-to-date (as at 1999) form of HTML.

HTML5 instead provides a listing of obsolete features to go along with the standardized normative content. They are broken down into &quot;obsolete but conforming&quot; for which implementation instructions exist and &quot;non-conforming&quot; ones that should be replaced.

The first Standard (HTML 2.0) contained four deprecated elements, one of which was invalid in HTML 3.2. All four are invalid in HTML 4.01 Transitional, which also deprecated a further ten elements. All of these, plus two others, are invalid in HTML 4.01 Strict. While the frame elements are still current in the sense of being present in the Transitional and Frameset DTDs, there are no plans to preserve them in future standards, as their function has been largely replaced, and they are highly problematic for user accessibility.

(Strictly speaking, the most recent &quot;XHTML&quot; standard, XHTML 1.1 (2001), does not include frames at all; it is approximately equivalent to XHTML 1.0 Strict, but also includes the Ruby markup module.)

A common source of confusion is the loose use of &quot;deprecated&quot; to refer to both deprecated and invalid status, and to elements that are expected to be formally deprecated in the future.

===Content vs. presentation and behavior===

Since HTML 4, HTML has increasingly focused on the separation of content (the visible text and images) from presentation (like color, font size, and layout). This is often referred to as a separation of concerns. HTML is used to represent the structure or content of a document, its presentation remains the sole responsibility of CSS style sheets. A default style sheet is suggested as part of the CSS standard, giving a default rendering for HTML.

Behavior (interactivity) is also kept separate from content, and is handled by scripts. Images are contained in separate graphics files, separate from text, though they can also be considered part of the content of a page.

Separation of concerns allows the document to be presented by different user agents according to their purposes and abilities. For example, a user agent can select an appropriate style sheet to present a document by displaying on a monitor, printing on paper, or to determine speech characteristics in an audio-only user agent. The structural and semantic functions of the markup remain identical in each case.

Historically, user agents did not always support these features. In the 1990s, as a stop-gap, presentational elements (like and ) were added to HTML, at the cost of creating problems for interoperability and user accessibility. This is now regarded as outmoded and has been superseded by style sheet-based design; most presentational elements are now deprecated.

External image files are incorporated with the or elements. (With XHTML, the SVG language can also be used to write graphics within the document, though linking to external SVG files is generally simpler.) Where an image is not purely decorative, HTML allows replacement content with similar semantic value to be provided for non-visual user agents.

An HTML document can also be extended through the use of scripts to provide additional behaviors beyond the abilities of HTML hyperlinks and forms.

The elements and , with related HTML attributes, provide style sheets and scripts.
* In the document head, and may link to shared external documents, or and may contain embedded instructions. (The element can also be used to link style sheets.)
* or can occur at any point in the document (head or body).
* The codice_12 attribute is valid in most document body elements (e.g. ) for inclusion of &quot;inline style&quot; instructions.
* &quot;Event-handling attributes&quot;, which provide links to scripts, are optional in most elements.
* For user agents which do not operate scripts, the element provides embedded alternative content where appropriate; however, it can only be used in the document head and in the body as a block-level element.

==Document structure elements==






==Document head elements==












==Document body elements==

In visual browsers, displayable elements can be rendered as either &quot;block&quot; or &quot;inline&quot;. While all elements are part of the document sequence, block elements appear within their parent elements:
* as rectangular objects which do not break across lines;
* with block margins, width, and height properties which can be set independently of the surrounding elements.
Conversely, inline elements are treated as part of the flow of document text; they cannot have margins, width, or height set, and do break across lines.

===Block elements===

Block elements, or block-level elements, have a rectangular structure. By default, these elements will span the entire width of its parent element, and will thus not allow any other element to occupy the same horizontal space as it is placed on.

The rectangular structure of a block element is often referred to as the box model, and is made up of several parts. Each element contains the following:
* The content of an element is the actual text (or other media) placed between the opening and closing tags of an element.
* The padding of an element is the space around the content but which still forms part of the element. Padding should not be used to create white space between two elements. Any background style assigned to the element, such as a background image or color, will be visible within the padding. Increasing the size of an element&#x27;s padding increases the amount of space this element will take up.
* The border of an element is the absolute end of an element and spans the perimeter of that element. The thickness of a border increases the size of an element.
* The margin of an element is the white space that surrounds an element. The content, padding, and border of any other element will not be allowed to enter this area unless forced to do so by some advanced CSS placement. Using most standard DTDs, margins on the left and right of different elements will push each other away. Margins on the top or bottom of an element, on the other hand, will not stack or will intermingle. This means that the white space between these elements will be as big as the larger margin between them.

The above section refers only to the detailed implementation of CSS rendering and has no relevance to HTML elements themselves.

====Basic text====





==== Lists ====










==== Other block elements ====




























===Inline elements===

Inline elements cannot be placed directly inside the element; they must be wholly nested within block-level elements.

====Anchor====



====Phrase elements====
Phrase elements are used for marking up phrases and adding structure or semantic meaning to text fragments. For example, the codice_13 and codice_13 tags can be used for adding emphasis to text.

=====General=====







=====Computer phrase elements=====
These elements are useful primarily for documenting computer code development and user interaction through differentiation of source code (), variables (), user input (), and terminal or other output ().







====Presentation====
As visual presentational markup only applies directly to visual browsers, its use is discouraged. Style sheets should be used instead. Several of these elements are deprecated or invalid in HTML 4 / XHTML 1.0, and the remainder are invalid in the current draft of XHTML 2.0. The current draft of HTML5, however, re-includes , , and , assigning new semantic meaning to each. In an HTML5 document, the use of these elements is no longer discouraged, provided that it is semantically correct.













====Span====



====Other inline elements====



























===Images and objects===

















===Forms===
These elements can be combined into a form or in some instances used separately as user-interface controls; in the document, they can be simple HTML or used in conjunction with Scripts. HTML markup specifies the elements that make up a form, and the method by which it will be submitted. However, some form of scripts (server-side, client-side, or both) must be used to process the user&#x27;s input once it is submitted.

(These elements are either block or inline elements, but are collected here as their use is more restricted than other inline or block elements.)























===Tables===
The format of HTML Tables was proposed in the HTML 3.0 Drafts and the later RFC 1942 &quot;HTML Tables&quot;. They were inspired by the CALS Table Model. Some elements in these proposals were included in HTML 3.2; the present form of HTML Tables was standardized in HTML 4. (Many of the elements used within tables are neither &quot;block&quot; nor &quot;inline&quot; elements.)















==Frames==
Frames allow a visual HTML browser window to be split into segments, each of which can show a different document. This can lower bandwidth use, as repeating parts of a layout can be used in one frame, while variable content is displayed in another. This may come at a certain usability cost, especially in non-visual user agents, due to separate and independent documents (or websites) being displayed adjacent to each other and being allowed to interact with the same parent window. Because of this cost, frames (excluding the element) are only allowed in HTML 4.01 Frame-set. Iframes can also hold documents on different servers. In this case the interaction between windows is blocked by the browser. Sites like Facebook and Twitter use iframes to display content (plugins) on third party websites. Google AdSense uses iframes to display banners on third party websites.

In HTML 4.01, a document may contain a and a a and a , but not both a and a . However, can be used in a normal document body.







===codice_15 attribute===
In HTML, codice_15 is an attribute used within the , , or elements. It is supposed to be a URL to a document that provides a long description for the image, frame, or iframe in question. This attribute should contain a URL, – as is commonly mistaken – the text of the description itself.

codice_15 was designed to be used by screen readers to display image information for computer users with accessibility issues, such as the blind or visually impaired, and is widely implemented by both web browsers and screen readers. Some developers object that it is actually seldom used for this purpose because there are relatively few authors who use the attribute and most of those authors use it incorrectly; thus, they recommend deprecating codice_15. The publishing industry has responded, advocating the retention of codice_15.

====Example====

&lt;img src=&quot;Hello.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;description.html&quot;&gt;

Content of codice_20:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an image of a two-layered birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;


====Linking to the long description in the text====
Since very few graphical browsers support making the link available natively (Opera and iCab being the exceptions), it is useful to include a link to the description page near the element whenever possible, as this can also aid sighted users.

=====Example=====

&lt;img src=&quot;Hello.jpg&quot; longdesc=&quot;description.html&quot; /&gt; [&lt;a href=
&quot;description.html&quot; title=&quot;long description of the image&quot;&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;]
==Historic elements==
The following elements were part of the early HTML developed by Tim Berners-Lee from 1989 to 1991; they are mentioned in &quot;HTML Tags&quot;, but deprecated in &quot;HTML 2.0&quot; and were never part of HTML standards.







==Non-standard elements==
This section lists some widely used obsolete elements, which means they are not used in valid code. They may not be supported in all user agents.

<doc id="274394" wikidata="Q595321" url="?curid=274394" title="Singing Revolution">
<text>The Singing Revolution was a series of events from 1987 to 1991 that led to the restoration of independence of the three Soviet-occupied Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania at the end of the Cold War. The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, Heinz Valk, in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988 spontaneous mass evening singing demonstrations at the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds.

==Background==

During World War II, the three Baltic countries were invaded and occupied by the Stalinist Soviet Union in June 1940, and formally annexed into the USSR in August 1940. Following the Nazi German occupation in 1941–1944/45, the three countries were reconquered by the Soviet army in 1944–1945. 

In 1985, the last leader of the former Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev introduced &quot;glasnost&quot; (&quot;openness&quot;) and &quot;perestroika&quot; (&quot;restructuring&quot;), hoping to stimulate the failing Soviet economy and encourage productivity, particularly in the areas of consumer goods, the liberalisation of cooperative businesses, and growing the service economy. Glasnost rescinded limitations on political freedoms in the Soviet Union, which led to problems for the Soviet central government in retaining control over non-Russian areas, including the occupied Baltic countries.

Hitherto unrecognised issues previously kept secret by the Soviet central government in Moscow were admitted to in public, causing further popular dissatisfaction with the Soviet regime in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Combined with the war in Afghanistan and the nuclear fallout in Chernobyl, grievances were aired in a publicly explosive and politically decisive manner. Estonians were concerned about the demographic threat to their national identity posed by the influx of individuals from foreign ethnic groups to work on such large Soviet development projects as phosphate mining.

Access to Western émigré communities abroad and, particularly in Estonia, informal relations with Finland, and access to Finnish TV showing the Western lifestyle also contributed to widespread dissatisfaction with the Soviet system and provoked mass demonstrations as repression on dissidents, nationalists, religious communities, and ordinary consumers eased substantially towards the end of the 1980s.

Massive demonstrations against the Soviet regime began after widespread liberalisation of the regime failed to take into account national sensitivities. It was hoped by Moscow that the non-Russian nations would remain within the USSR despite the removal of restrictions on freedom of speech and national icons (such as the local pre-1940 flags). However, the situation deteriorated to such an extent that by 1989 there were campaigns aimed at freeing the nations from the Soviet Union altogether.

==Estonia==
The Soviet government&#x27;s plan to excavate phosphorite in the Lääne-Viru county with potentially catastrophic consequences for the environment and society was revealed in February 1987. That started the &quot;Phosphorite War&quot;, a public environmental campaign. The MRP-AEG group held the Hirvepark meeting in the Old Town of Tallinn at the anniversary of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1987, demanding to disclose and condemn its secret protocol.

The &quot;Five Patriotic Songs&quot; series by Alo Mattiisen premiered at the Tartu Pop Festival in May 1988. In June the Old Town Festival was held in Tallinn, and after the official part of the festival, the participants moved to the Song Festival Grounds and started to sing patriotic songs together spontaneously. The Baltic Way, a human chain of two million people, spanned from Tallinn to Vilnius on 23 August 1989. Mattiisen&#x27;s &quot;Five Patriotic Songs&quot; were performed again at the Rock Summer festival in Tallinn held on 26–28 August 1988. The Song of Estonia festival was held at the Song Festival Grounds on 11 September. Trivimi Velliste, Chairman of the Estonian Heritage Society, first voiced the public ambition to regain independence. The Supreme Soviet of Estonia issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration on 16 November.

The Singing Revolution lasted over four years, with various protests and acts of defiance. The revolution was led by three different groups: the Heritage Society, the Popular Front, and the National Independence Party. The Heritage Society, established in 1987, focused on spreading awareness about Estonia&#x27;s history to gather support for Estonia&#x27;s independence from the Soviets. The Popular Front, founded in 1988, wanted to reform Estonia into self-government within a loose confederation of the Soviet Union. The National Independence Party, established in 1988 as well, was more radical than the other two organizations and demanded complete independence from the Soviet Union. 

In 1991, as the central government in Moscow and the Soviet Army attempted to stop the Estonian progress towards independence, the newly elected legislature of Estonia together with an elected grassroots parliament, Congress of Estonia, proclaimed the restoration of the independent state of Estonia and repudiated Soviet legislation. Large groups of unarmed volunteers went to shield the parliament, radio and TV buildings from any attacks by Soviet troops. Through these actions Estonia regained its independence without any blood shed.

Independence was declared on the late evening of 20 August 1991, after an agreement between different political parties was reached. The next morning Soviet troops, according to Estonian TV, attempted to storm Tallinn TV Tower but were unsuccessful. The Communist hardliners&#x27; coup attempt failed amidst mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Moscow led by Boris Yeltsin.

On 22 August 1991, Iceland (independent country since 1944) announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with Estonia, and Iceland thus became the first foreign country to formally recognise the fully restored independence of Estonia in 1991. Today, a plaque commemorating this event is situated on the outside wall of the Foreign Ministry, which is on Islandi väljak 1, or &quot;Iceland Square 1&quot;. The plaque reads; &quot;The Republic of Iceland was the first to recognise, on 22 August 1991, the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Estonia&quot;, in Estonian, Icelandic and English. Some other nations did not recognise the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union.

==Latvia==
During the second half of the 1980s as Mikhail Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika in the USSR, which rolled back restrictions to freedom in the Soviet Union, aversion to the Soviet regime had grown into the third Latvian National Awakening, which reached its peak in mid-1988.

In 1986, it became widely known to the public that the USSR was planning to build another hydroelectric power plant on Latvia&#x27;s largest river Daugava, and that a decision had been made to build a metro in Riga. Both of these projects planned by Moscow could have led to the destruction of Latvia&#x27;s landscape and cultural and historical heritage. In the press journalists urged the public to protest against these decisions. The public reacted immediately, and in response, the Environmental Protection Club was founded on 28 February 1987. During the second half of the 1980s, the Environmental Protection Club became one of the most influential mass movements in the region and began to make demands for the restoration of Latvia&#x27;s independence.

On 14 June 1987, the anniversary of the 1941 deportations, the human rights group &quot;Helsinki-86&quot;, which had been founded a year earlier, organized people to place flowers at the Freedom Monument (Latvia&#x27;s symbol of independence, which was erected in 1935). This is widely cited as the beginning of the National Awakening. However, the Latvian Song and Dance Festival of 1985 also had been sometimes named as such for choirs requesting and performing the song &quot;Gaismas pils&quot; conducted by Haralds Mednis after the main event. The song, which speaks about the rebirth of a free Latvian nation, usually a staple of the festival, had been removed from the repertoire; the conductor, disliked by Soviet authorities, was sidelined at the closing concert. He was called from his seat by the choir and &#x27;Gaismas pils&#x27; was performed, airing live on Riga Television.

On 1 and 2 June 1988, the Writers&#x27; Union held a congress during which the democratization of society, Latvia&#x27;s economic sovereignty, the cessation of immigration from the USSR, the transformation of industry, and the protection of Latvian language rights were discussed by delegates. Over the course of this conference, for the first time in post-war Latvia, the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which had determined Latvia&#x27;s fate after 1939, was publicly acknowledged.

The congress of the Writers&#x27; Union stirred up public opinion and provided an additional stimulus for the general process of national revival.

In the summer of 1988, two of the most important organizations of the revival period began to assemble themselves—the Latvian People&#x27;s Front and the Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM). Soon afterwards the more radically inclined Citizens&#x27; Congress called for complete non-compliance with the representatives of the Soviet regime. All of these organisations had a common goal: the restoration of democracy and independence. On 7 October 1988, there was a mass public demonstration, calling for Latvia&#x27;s independence and the establishment of a regular judicial order. On 8 and 9 October the first congress of the Latvian People&#x27;s Front was held. This organization, which attracted 200,000 members, became the main representative of the return to independence.

On 23 August 1989, the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the People&#x27;s Fronts of all three Baltic countries held a huge demonstration of unity—the &quot;Baltic Way&quot;. A human &quot;chain&quot; from Tallinn through Riga to Vilnius was assembled. This was a symbolic demonstration of the people&#x27;s call for independence from the Soviet Union.

New elections to the Supreme Soviet took place on 18 March 1990, in which the supporters of independence gained a victory. On 4 May 1990, the new Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted a motion, &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;, which called for the restoration of the inter-war Latvian state and the 1922 Constitution.

In January 1991, however, pro-communist political forces attempted to restore Soviet power. With the use of force, attempts were made to overthrow the new assembly. Latvian demonstrators managed to stop the Soviet troops from re-occupying strategic positions, and these events are known as the &quot;Days of the Barricades&quot;.

On 19 August 1991, an unsuccessful attempt at a coup d&#x27;état took place in Moscow when a small group of prominent Soviet functionaries failed to regain power due to large pro-democracy demonstrations in Russia. This event resulted in Latvia swiftly moving toward independence. After the coup&#x27;s failure, the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Republic announced on 21 August 1991, that the transition period to full independence declared on 4 May 1990 had come to an end. Therefore, Latvia was proclaimed a fully independent nation whose judicial foundation stemmed back to the statehood that existed before the occupation on 17 June 1940.

==Lithuania==
Between 1956 and 1987, open public resistance to the Soviet regime was rare. It became more persistent in the 1970s and 1980s. One example of this could be the Kaunas events of 1972. Many popular singers often used the poetry of nationalist poets such as Bernardas Brazdžionis or Justinas Marcinkevičius, as the lyrics of their songs. In 1987 the Rock March also promoted awareness of the issue among the people.

In 1987, various organisations (mainly environmental ones) were founded. On 3 June 1988, the Sąjūdis, a political and social movement, was established. Some initiators of this movement were active members of environmental organisations, established in 1987 (e.g. Zigmas Vaišvila, Gintaras Songaila). Initially, this organisation supported the regime, but in early autumn of the same year after Lithuania-wide growth, it became an opposing force to the CPL.

In response to this, Sąjūdis became a more centralised organisation. The active nationalist opposition (mostly the Lithuanian Liberty League) towards the regime culminated in various public protests. The most notorious of them took place on 28 October 1988, which ended up with violent dispersal. The resulting public anger caused resignations in the Communist Party of Lithuania (including the then-First Secretary of the party, Ringaudas Songaila, who served just over a year) and replaced them with more moderate members.

As the CPL leadership changed, it decided to return Vilnius Cathedral, formerly used as a museum of fine arts, to the Catholic community on 21 October 1988. The national anthem of Lithuania and the traditional national Tricolore were legalised in Lithuania on 18 November 1988, officially replacing the flag and the anthem of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was followed by the recognition of the Lithuanian language as a state language, what meant that it became the sole legal language on an institutional level. The latter change was instrumental in the removal of some officials (e.g. Nikolai Mitkin, who served as the Second Secretary of the CPL), but fueled tensions in Polish and Russian speaking communities.

It was followed by the gradual rebuilding of national symbols, which included erecting or restoring independence monuments throughout the country in late 1988 and 1989.

During 1989, various organisations (e.g. The Writers Union) split from the Soviet ones. Prior to the election of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union, Sąjūdis media became more restricted, but after the defeat of the CPL (it won just six seats of 42, other seats were won Sąjūdis supported candidates), restrictions were lifted. By the end of the year, the CPL gave up its power monopoly and agreed to hold free elections for Supreme Soviet of Lithuanian SSR in 1990, which it lost.

Five decades after Lithuania was occupied and incorporated into the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the first republic to declare its independence from the USSR on 11 March 1990, while Estonia and Latvia declared Soviet rule to have been illegal from the start and since full restoration of independence was not yet feasible, started a period of transition towards independence, culminating with the failure of the August coup. For the same reason, almost all nations in the international community, except Iceland, hesitated to recognise independence for Lithuania until August 1991.

The Soviet military responded harshly. On 13 January 1991, fourteen non-violent protesters in Vilnius died and hundreds were injured defending the Vilnius Television Tower and the Parliament from Soviet assault troops and tanks. Lithuanians refer to the event as Day of the Defenders of Freedom. The discipline and courage of its citizens – linking arms and singing in the face of tanks and armour-piercing bullets – avoided a much greater loss of life and showed the world that Lithuania&#x27;s citizens were prepared to defend their national independence.

International governments began recognizing Lithuanian independence after the failure of the coup d&#x27;état in August 1991.

<text>The Royal Mint is the United Kingdom&#x27;s official maker of British coins. It is currently located in Llantrisant, Wales, where it moved in 1968.

Operating under the legal name The Royal Mint Limited, it is a limited company that is wholly owned by His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury and is under an exclusive contract to supply the nation&#x27;s coinage. As well as minting circulating coins for the UK and international markets, The Royal Mint is a leading provider of precious metal products.

The Royal Mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England, all of Great Britain, the United Kingdom, and nations across the Commonwealth.

The Royal Mint operated within the Tower of London for several hundred years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court, where it remained until the 1960s. As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency, the Mint moved from London to a new 38-acre (15 ha) plant in Llantrisant, Glamorgan, Wales, where it has remained since.

Since 2018 The Royal Mint has been evolving its business to help offset declining cash use. It has expanded into precious metals investment, historic coins, and luxury collectibles, which saw it deliver an operating profit of £12.7 million in 2020–2021.

In 2022 The Royal Mint announced it was building a new plant in South Wales to recover precious metals from electronic waste. The first of this sustainably sourced gold is already being used in a new jewellery division – 886 by The Royal Mint – named in celebration of its symbolic founding date.

== History ==

=== Origin ===

The history of coins in Great Britain can be traced back to the second century BC when they were introduced by Celtic tribes from across the English Channel. The first record of coins being minted in Britain is attributed to Kentish tribes such as the Cantii who around 80–60 BC imitated those of Marseille through casting instead of hammering. After the Romans began their invasion of Britain in AD 43, they set up mints across the land, which produced Roman coins for some 40 years before closing. A mint in London reopened briefly in 383 until closing swiftly as Roman rule in Britain came to an end. For the next 200 years, no coins appear to have been minted in Britain until the emergence of English kingdoms in the sixth and seventh centuries. By 650, as many as 30 mints are recorded across Britain. 

=== 1279 to 1672 ===

In 1279, the country&#x27;s numerous mints were unified under a single system whereby control was centralised to the mint within the Tower of London. Mints outside London were reduced, with only a few local and episcopal mints continuing to operate. Pipe rolls containing the financial records of the London mint show an expenditure of and records of timber bought for workshops.

Individual roles at the mint were well established by 1464. The master worker was charged with hiring engravers and managing moneyers, while the Warden was responsible for witnessing the delivery of dies. A specialist mint board was set up in 1472 to enact a 23 February indenture that vested the mint&#x27;s responsibilities into three main roles: a warden, a master and comptroller.

In the early 16th century, mainland Europe was in the middle of an economic expansion, but England was suffering from financial difficulties brought on by excessive government spending. By the 1540s, wars with France and Scotland led Henry VIII to enact The Great Debasement, which saw the amount of precious metal in coins significantly reduced. In order to strengthen control of the country&#x27;s currency, monasteries were dissolved, which effectively ended major coin production outside London.

In 1603, the Union of Crowns of England and Scotland under King James I led to a partial union of the two kingdoms&#x27; currencies, the pound Scots and the pound sterling. Because Scotland had heavily debased its silver coins, a Scots mark was worth just pence while an English mark was worth 6 shillings 8 pence (80 pence). To bridge the difference between the values, unofficial supplementary token coins, often made from lead, were made by unauthorised minters across the country. By 1612, there were 3,000 such unlicensed mints producing these tokens, none of them paying anything to the government. The Royal Mint, not wanting to divert manpower from minting more profitable gold and silver coins, hired outside agent Lord Harington who, under license, started issuing copper farthings in 1613. Private licenses to mint these coins were revoked in 1644, which led traders to resume minting their own supplementary tokens. In 1672, the Royal Mint finally took over the production of copper coinage.

==== Civil War mints ====

In 1630, sometime before the outbreak of the English Civil War, England signed a treaty with Spain that ensured a steady supply of silver bullion to the Tower mint. Additional branch mints to aid the one in London were set up, including one at Aberystwyth Castle in Wales. In 1642, parliament seized control of the Tower mint. After Charles I tried to arrest the Five Members, he was forced to flee London and established at least 16 emergency mints across the British Isles in Carlisle, Chester, Colchester, Cork, Dublin, Edinburgh, Exeter, Newark, Pontefract, Salisbury, Scarborough, parts of Cornwall including Truro, Weymouth, Worcester, and York (see also siege money).

After raising the royal standard in Nottingham, marking the beginning of the civil war, Charles called on loyalist mining engineer Thomas Bushell, the owner of a mint and silver mine in Aberystwyth, to move his operations to the royalist-held Shrewsbury, possibly within the grounds of Shrewsbury Castle. However, this mint was short-lived, operating for no more than three months before Charles ordered Bushell to relocate the mint to his headquarters in the royal capital of Oxford. The new Oxford mint was established on 15 December 1642 in New Inn Hall, the present site of St Peter&#x27;s College. There, silver plates and foreign coins were melted down and, in some cases, just hammered into shape to produce coins quickly. Bushell was appointed the mint&#x27;s warden and master-worker, and he laboured alongside notable engravers Nicholas Briot, Thomas Rawlins and Nicholas Burghers, the last of whom was appointed Graver of Seals, Stamps, and Medals in 1643. When Prince Rupert took control of Oxford that same year, Bushell was ordered to move to Bristol Castle, where he continued minting coins until it fell to parliamentary control on 11 September 1645, effectively ending Bushell&#x27;s involvement in the civil war mints.

In November 1642, the king ordered royalist MP Richard Vyvyan to build one or more mints in Cornwall, where he was instructed to mint coins from whatever bullion could be obtained and deliver them to Ralph Hopton, a commander of royalist troops in the region. Vyvyan built a mint in Truro and was its Master until 1646, when it was captured by parliamentarians. In December 1642, the parliamentarians set up a mint in nearby Exeter, which had been under parliamentary control since the beginning of the war and was under constant threat of attack by loyalist troops. In September 1643, the town was captured by the Cornish Royalist Army led by Prince Maurice, leading Vyvyan to move his nearby mint in Truro to the captured town. The exact location of the mint in Exeter is unknown; however, maps from the time show a street named Old Mint Lane near Friernhay, which was to be the site of a 1696 Recoinage mint. Much less is known about the mint&#x27;s employees, with only Richard Vyvyan and clerk Thomas Hawkes recorded.

Following Charles I&#x27;s execution in 1649, the newly formed Commonwealth of England established its own set of coins, which for the first time used English rather than Latin and were more plainly designed than those issued under the monarchy. The government invited French engineer Peter Blondeau, who worked at the Paris Mint, to come to London in 1649 in the hope of modernising the country&#x27;s minting process. In France, hammer-stuck coins had been banned from the Paris Mint since 1639 and replaced with milled coinage. Blondeau began his testing in May 1651 in Drury House. He initially produced milled silver pattern pieces of half-crowns, shillings and sixpences; however rival moneyers continued using the old hammering method. In 1656, Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell ordered engraver Thomas Simon to cut a series of dies featuring his bust and for them to be minted using the new milled method. Few of Cromwell&#x27;s coins entered circulation; Cromwell died in 1658 and the Commonwealth collapsed two years later. Without Cromwell&#x27;s backing of milled coinage, Blondeau returned to France, leaving England to continue minting hammer-struck coins.

===1660 to 1805===

In 1662, after previous attempts to introduce milled coinage into Britain had failed, the restored monarch Charles II recalled Peter Blondeau to establish a permanent machine-made coinage. Despite the introduction of the newer, milled coins, like the old hammered coins they suffered heavily from counterfeiting and clipping. To combat this the text &quot;Decus et tutamen&quot; (&quot;An ornament and a safeguard&quot;) was added to some coin rims.

After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when James II was ousted from power, parliament took over control of the mint from the Crown, which had until then allowed the mint to act as an independent body producing coins on behalf of the government.

Under the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, Isaac Newton became the mint&#x27;s warden in 1696. His role, intended to be a sinecure, was taken seriously by Newton, who went about trying to combat the country&#x27;s growing problems with counterfeiting. By this time, forgeries accounted for 10% of the country&#x27;s coinage, clipping was commonplace and the value of the silver in coins had surpassed their face value. King William III initiated the Great Recoinage of 1696 whereby all coins were removed from circulation, and enacted the Coin Act 1696, making it high treason to own or possess counterfeiting equipment. Satellite mints to aid in the recoinage were established in Bristol, Chester, Exeter, Norwich, and York, with returned coins being valued by weight, not face value.

The Acts of Union 1707 united England and Scotland into one country, leading London to take over production of Scotland&#x27;s currency and thus replacing Scotland&#x27;s Pound Scots with the English Pound sterling. As a result, the Edinburgh mint closed on 4 August 1710. As Britain&#x27;s empire continued to expand, so too did the need to supply its coinage. This, along with the need for new mint machinery and cramped conditions within the Tower of London, led to plans for the mint to move to nearby East Smithfield.

=== 1805 to 1914 ===

==== Tower Hill ====
Construction started in 1805 of the new purpose-built mint on Tower Hill, opposite the Tower of London, and it was completed by 1809. In 1812, the move became official: the keys of the old mint were ceremoniously delivered to the Constable of the Tower. Facing the front of the site stood the Johnson Smirke Building, named for its designer James Johnson and builder Robert Smirke. Construction was supervised by the architect John Lidbury Poole (father of the famous singer, Elizabeth Poole). This building was flanked on both sides by gatehouses behind which another building housed the mint&#x27;s new machinery. Several other smaller buildings were erected, which housed mint officers and staff members. The entire site was protected by a boundary wall patrolled by the Royal Mint&#x27;s military guard.

By 1856, the mint was beginning to prove inefficient: there were irregularities in minted coins&#x27; fineness and weight. Instructed by Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, the Master of the Mint Thomas Graham was informed that unless the mint could raise its standards and become more economical, it would be broken up and placed under management by contractors. Graham sought advice from German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who in turn recommended his student George Frederick Ansell to resolve the mint&#x27;s issues. In a letter to the Treasury dated 29 October 1856, Ansell was put forward as a candidate. He was appointed as a temporary clerk on 12 November 1856, with a salary of £120 per year.

Upon taking office, Ansell discovered that the weighing of metals at the mint was extremely loose. At the mint, it had been the custom to weigh silver to the nearest and gold to a pennyweight (0.05 oz); however, these standards meant losses were being made from overvalued metals. In one such case, Ansell delivered 7920.00 oz of gold to the mint, where it was weighed by an official at 7918.15 oz, a difference of 1.85 oz. Requesting a second weighing on a more accurate scale, the bullion was certified to weigh 7919.98 oz, far closer to the previous measurement, which was off by 960 grains. To increase the accuracy of weights, more precise weighing equipment was ordered, and the tolerance was revised to 0.10 oz for silver and 0.01 oz for gold. Between 1856 and 1866, the old scales were gradually removed and replaced with scales made by Messrs. De Grave, Short, and Fanner; winners of an 1862 International Exhibition prize award for work relating to balances.

Ansell also noticed a loss of gold during the manufacturing process. He found that 15 to 20 ounces could be recovered from the sweep, that is, the leftover burnt rubbish from the minting process, which was often left in open boxes for many months before being removed. Wanting to account for every particle and knowing that it was physically impossible for gold just to disappear, he put down the lost weight to a combination of oil, dust, and different types of foreign matter amongst the gold.

In 1859, the Royal Mint rejected a batch of gold found to be too brittle for the minting of gold sovereigns. Analysis revealed the presence of small amounts of antimony, arsenic and lead. With Ansell&#x27;s background in chemistry, he persuaded the Royal Mint to allow him to experiment with the alloy, and was ultimately able to produce 167,539 gold sovereigns. On a second occasion in 1868, it was again discovered that gold coins, this time totalling £500,000 worth, were being produced with inferior gold. Although the standard practice at the mint was for rejected coins (known as brockages) to be melted down, many entered general circulation, and the mint was forced to return thousands of ounces of gold to the Bank of England. Although Ansell offered to re-melt the substandard coins, his offer was rejected, causing a row between him and senior mint chiefs, which ultimately led to him being removed from his position at the mint.

After the high-level practice as deputy engraver in the Royal Mint, Charles Wiener went then to Lisbon in 1864 as chief engraver to the Mint of Portugal. In 1863 he made a commemorative medal for Prince Albert (1819-1861), consort of Queen Victoria. (Victoria and Albert Museum).

==== Royal Mint Refinery ====
After relocating to its new home on Tower Hill, the Mint came under increased scrutiny of how it dealt with unrefined gold that had entered the country. The Master of the Mint had been responsible for overseeing the practice since the position&#x27;s inception in the 14th century. However, the refinery process proved too costly and suffered from a lack of accountability from the master. A Royal Commission was set up in 1848 to address these issues; it recommended that the refinery process be outsourced to an external agency, thereby removing the refining process from the mint&#x27;s responsibilities. The opportunity to oversee the Mint&#x27;s refinery was taken up by Anthony de Rothschild, a descendant of the Rothschild family and heir to the multinational investment banking company N M Rothschild &amp; Sons. Rothschild secured a lease from the government in January 1852, purchasing equipment and premises adjacent to the Royal Mint on 19 Royal Mint Street under the name of &quot;Royal Mint Refinery&quot;.

==== Colonial expansion ====

As Britain&#x27;s influence as a world power expanded, with colonies being established abroad, a greater need for currency led to the Royal Mint opening satellite branches overseas. This need first arose in the then-Colony of New South Wales, as the black-market trade in gold during and following the 1851 Australian gold rush threatened to undermine the colony&#x27;s economy. In 1851 the colony&#x27;s Legislative Council sent Queen Victoria a petition seeking a local mint for Sydney, and in 1853 the Queen issued an Order in Council providing for the establishment of the Sydney Branch of the Royal Mint. The Royal Mint&#x27;s Superintendent of Coining travelled to Australia to oversee its establishment on Macquarie Street within the southern wing of Sydney Hospital, where it opened in 1855. Production increased quickly: assayer&#x27;s notes from 29 October 1855 indicate that the mint&#x27;s Bullion Office had purchased of unrefined gold in the preceding week alone, and the mint&#x27;s overall coin output averaged over £1,000,000 yearly in its first five years of operation. In 1868, gold sovereigns minted in Sydney were made legal tender in all British colonies, and in February 1886 they were given equal status in the UK itself.

The success of the Sydney branch led to the opening of similar branches in Melbourne and Perth, on 2 June 1872 and 20 June 1899 respectively. Following the Federation of Australia in 1901 and the establishment of a separate Australian pound in 1910, all three branches were used by the Commonwealth government to mint circulating coins for Australia. The Melbourne and Perth branches had capabilities superior to those in Sydney, and they took over production responsibilities for Australia when the Sydney branch closed after 72 years of operation at the end of 1926. Following the establishment of the Royal Australian Mint as a central mint for Australian coinage, the Melbourne and Perth mints were divested by the Royal Mint on 1 July 1970.

In Canada, which had been under British rule since 1763, British coins circulated alongside those of other nations until 1858, when London started producing coins for the newly established Canadian dollar. As Canada developed in 1890, calls were made for a mint to be built in Ottawa to facilitate the country&#x27;s gold mines. The new mint was opened on 2 January 1908 by Lord Grey, producing coins for circulation, including Ottawa Mint sovereigns. In 1931, under the Statute of Westminster, the mint came under the control of the Government of Canada and was subsequently renamed the Royal Canadian Mint.A fifth branch of the Royal Mint was established in Mumbai (Bombay), India on 21 December 1917 as part of a wartime effort. It struck sovereigns from 15 August 1918 until 22 April 1919 but closed in May 1919. A sixth and final overseas mint was established in the Union of South Africa in Pretoria on 1 January 1923, producing £83,114,575 worth of sovereigns in its lifetime. As South Africa began cutting ties with Britain, the mint closed on 30 June 1941 but was later reopened as the South African Mint.

Although London&#x27;s Royal Mint officially controlled just six mints, many more independent mints were set up in parts of the British Empire. At New Westminster in British Columbia, the British Columbia gold rushes led to a mint being established in 1862 by Francis George Claudet, under Governor James Douglas. It produced a few gold and silver coins before being shut down in 1862 to aid the city of Victoria in becoming the region&#x27;s provincial capital. On 26 February 1864, an Order in Council requested the founding of an independent mint (Hong Kong Mint) in British Hong Kong to issue silver and bronze coins. But this mint was short-lived, due to its coins being heavily debased, causing significant losses. The site was sold to Jardine Matheson in 1868, and the mint machinery was sold to the Japanese Mint in Osaka.

=== 1914 to 1966 ===
In 1914, as war broke out in Europe, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George instructed that gold coins be removed from circulation to help pay for the war effort. The government started to issue £1 and 10-shilling Treasury notes as replacements, paving the way for Britain to leave the gold standard in 1931. The Bombay Mint sovereign was the £1 coin.

From 1928, the Irish Free State (later the Republic of Ireland) issued its own coins. The Royal Mint produced these until Ireland established its own Currency Centre in Dublin in 1978.

During World War II, the Mint was important in ensuring people were paid for their services with hard currency rather than banknotes. Under Operation Bernhard, the Nazis planned to collapse the British economy by flooding the country with forged notes, leading the Bank of England to stop issuing banknotes of £10 and above. To meet these demands, the Mint doubled its output so that by 1943 it was minting around 700 million coins a year despite the constant threat of being bombed. The Deputy Master of the Mint, John Craig, recognised the dangers to the Mint and introduced several measures to ensure the Mint could continue to operate in the event of a disaster. Craig added emergency water supplies, reinforced the Mint&#x27;s basement to act as an air-raid shelter and even accepted employment of women for the first time. For most of the war, the mint managed to escape most of the destruction of the Blitz, but in December 1940 three members of staff were killed in an air raid. Around the same time, an auxiliary mint was set up at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, which had been requisitioned for the war effort. Staff and machinery from Tower Hill were moved to the site, which started production in June 1941 and operated for the duration of the war. Over the course of the war, the Royal Mint was hit on several occasions, and at one point was put out of commission for three weeks. As technology changed with the introduction of electricity and demand continued to grow, the rebuilding process continued so that by the 1960s, little of the original mint remained, apart from Smirke&#x27;s 1809 building and its gatehouses at the front.

=== Since 1966 ===

==== Relocation to Wales ====
On 1 March 1966, the government announced plans to decimalise the nation&#x27;s currency, thereby requiring the withdrawal of millions of coins and the re-minting of new ones. At its current site on Tower Hill, the mint had suffered from lack of space for many years, and it would be inadequate to meet the anticipated high demand a recoinage would entail. A possible move to a more suitable site had been discussed as far back as 1870, when Deputy Master of the Mint Charles Fremantle had recommended it in his first annual report. At the time, it had been suggested that the valuable land at Tower Hill could be sold to finance the purchase of land at nearby Whitefriars and pay for a new mint building. However, after many years of subsequent debate in Parliament it had been decided that improvements could be made to the existing site at Tower Hill. With Decimal Day set for 1971, the government quickly decided where to establish the new mint.

Over twenty sites were considered including suggestions for Scotland and Northern Ireland; however, the small Welsh town of Llantrisant, ten miles (16 km) northwest of Cardiff, was eventually chosen. Work on the new mint began in August 1967 with the construction of a blank treatment plant and a plant for striking. This first phase of the mint was formally opened on 17 December 1968 in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles. There had been fears that the Royal Family would face protests because some Welsh people were unhappy about the Investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales; however, no such protests materialised. The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from raw metals; thus completing the full minting process. Upon completion the final cost for the land, buildings and plant came to £8 million. Coin minting gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years, and the last coin, a gold sovereign, was struck in London in November 1975.

==== Financial difficulties ====
After moving to Wales, the mint struggled to be profitable as the Western world fell into a deep recession during the early 1970s. To combat a rising national debt, the mint was established as a trading fund on 1 April 1975, which required it to become self-financing. This measure proved successful, and the mint became more profitable through heavy exports. In April 1990, the mint became an Executive Agency; however, by 2001, the mint had reported its first annual loss: a result attributed to only securing 5% of new euro coin production rather than the projected 20%. Despite this, the mint began diversifying its product range by offering items outside its usual coin-related merchandise. Around this time, the mint was selling different types of jewellery, commemorative plates and figurines, eventually creating its own &quot;Royal Mint Classics&quot; range of collectible goods. This part of the business proved popular in attracting new customers, but it suffered from poor product development. Its products included a hip flask with an embedded £2 coin, an Edinburgh Crystal clock combined with a millennium Crown, and a Wedgwood plate featuring Britannia. In 2007, the Mint decided to resume its focus on coins, downsizing non-coin related business and discontinuing its Classics range.

The 2008 global financial crisis was another financial blow: a rescue package costing £500 billion was announced to help stabilise Britain&#x27;s banking system. This led to fears that the government would attempt to finance the cost by selling off state-owned organisations. In his 2009 pre-budget report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling stated that the Treasury would &quot;explore the potential benefits of alternative future models for the Royal Mint&quot;. A month later in his 2009 United Kingdom budget, he recommended that the mint be made a company with a view to it being sold.

The recommendation was met with outrage by unions and opposition parties in parliament, who called it the &quot;selling off the family silver&quot; and said it would result in job losses. In contrast, the chief executive of the mint, Andrew Stafford, welcomed the proposal, saying that it would lead to further growth and secure the future of the business. 

On 31 December 2009, rather than being fully privatised, the mint ceased to be an executive agency and its assets were vested in a limited company, &quot;Royal Mint Ltd&quot;. The owner of the new company became The Royal Mint trading fund, which itself continued to be owned by HM Treasury. As its sole shareholder, the mint pays an annual dividend of £4 million to the Treasury, with the remaining profits being reinvested into the mint. In 2015, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced a £20 billion privatisation drive to raise funds, with the Royal Mint being up for sale alongside other institutions including the Met Office and Companies House.

In the 21st century cash was becoming less commonly used, with no coins minted, for the first time, in 2024, and the Mint was seeking new sources of revenue such as its &quot;886&quot; jewellery line.

==== Revival ====
In 2012 The Royal Mint had a network of hundreds of UK sellers of their products. This ensured competitive pricing and availability to the UK public.

;2012 London Olympics

After London was selected to host the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Royal Mint put in a successful bid to manufacture the Games&#x27; Olympic and Paralympic medals. 4,700 gold, silver and bronze medals were produced by the Mint; each medal was struck 15 times with 900 tonnes of force.

In addition to securing the medal product contract, the Mint held a competition to design a series of commemorative 50p coins that would enter general circulation before the event. The Mint received over 30,000 entries, with a further 17,000 from a children&#x27;s competition on the television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. In all, a total of 29 designs featuring a sport were selected by the Mint; the youngest designer was just 9 years old. A £2 coin commemorating London&#x27;s handover to Rio de Janeiro was also released in 2012.

;The Royal Mint Experience
In April 2014, the Mint announced plans to develop a visitor centre in Llantrisant, where members of the public could go on a guided tour of the facility and learn about the mint&#x27;s history. The development contract, estimated to be worth £7.7 million, was awarded to construction firm ISG and design consultant Mather &amp; Co., who had previously designed the Norwegian Olympic Museum, as well as a handful of visitor attractions for sports clubs including Chelsea F.C., Manchester City F.C., FC Porto, and the Springboks. To fund the development, a grant of £2.3 million was provided by the Welsh Government towards the attraction which aimed to attract 200,000 visitors a year to the area. By May 2016, two years after its announcement, the attraction, designed by Rio Architects and now named &quot;Royal Mint Experience&quot;, opened to the public at a final cost of £9 million. The visitor centre includes an interactive museum, a view of the factory floor, an education centre, and a press where visitors can strike their own souvenir 50 pence coin. On display at the centre are more than 80,000 artefacts, including Olympic medals, a pattern coin of Edward VIII, a Janvier reducing machine and a selection of trial plates.

=== Since 2014 ===
In the same month, the mint took in 48 tonnes of silver recovered from the shipwreck of the SS &quot;Gairsoppa&quot; (torpedoed in 1941), which was used to produce limited edition coins.

In 2015, after nearly 50 years, the mint began producing its own line of bullion bars and coins under its revived &quot;Royal Mint Refinery&quot; brand. Then in 2016, the mint announced plans for Royal Mint Gold (RMG), a digital gold currency that uses blockchain to trade and invest in gold. However, this project was cancelled in 2018.

The Royal Mint, in February 2020, listed its first financial product: the Royal Mint Physical Gold Commodity Exchange-traded fund (ETF): RMAU. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse. RMAU is the first gold ETF backed 100% by the London Bullion Market Association responsible sourcing programme. Investors can also convert RMAU into coins and gold bars. The Royal Mint partnered with white label ETF firm HANetf.

==== Jewellery line ====

The Mint, seeking to diversify, launched a line of sustainable luxury hand-made jewellery, 886 by The Royal Mint, in 2022, selling online and from a shop in London&#x27;s Burlington Arcade. The collection uses gold recovered from electronic waste and other recycled sources. In 2024 the it was expecting to become profitable the following year.

== Operations ==

=== Coin production ===
As the sole body responsible for minting legal tender coins in the United Kingdom under contract from HM Treasury, the mint produces all of the country&#x27;s physical coinage; banknotes are printed by the Bank of England. On average, it strikes two billion sterling coins for general circulation every year, with an estimated 28 billion coins circulating altogether. Outside the UK, historically, the mint has provided services to over 60 countries, including New Zealand and many Caribbean nations, by minting national currencies or supplying ready-to-strike planchets. In 2015, it was estimated that 2.4  billion coins were minted for overseas countries, exceeding domestic coinage production and providing over 60% of the mint&#x27;s revenue from circulating currencies. 

In 2024, the Royal Mint announced that it would cease its production of coins for other countries due to the decline in cash use globally.

=== Precious Metals Recovery Facility ===
Declining cash use has been a catalyst for change at The Royal Mint, spurring innovation and a portfolio of new businesses. In 2024, The Royal Mint unveiled its new Precious Metals Recovery facility at its site in south Wales. The 3,700 square metre facility provides a more sustainable source of gold to the business, reducing its reliance on mining. It uses world-first patented chemistry from Canadian clean tech company Excir, extracting gold from printed circuit boards (PCBs) found in everyday electronic items such as TVs, laptops and mobile phones in minutes. Excir&#x27;s chemistry works at room temperature, enabling energy- and cost-effective gold recovery.

=== Commemorative coins ===
The Mint also regularly produces commemorative coins for the collectors&#x27; market, with a range of varying quality and made of different precious metals.

=== Bullion ===
Another important operation of the mint, which contributes half the mint&#x27;s revenue, is the sale of bullion to investors and the general public in the form of bars and coins. Historically, the mint refined its own metal; but following the advice of an 1848 Royal Commission, the process was separated, with the independent &quot;Royal Mint Refinery&quot; being purchased and operated by Anthony de Rothschild in 1852. The Rothschild family continued the refinery&#x27;s management until it was sold to Engelhard in 1967. A year later, the Royal Mint relocated to Wales and ceased its bullion bar interests, but the brand was revived in 2015. Bullion bars produced by the mint are stamped with the original Royal Mint Refinery emblem and come in a range of sizes.
:Minting of bullion coins began in 1957 to meet a demand for authentic sovereign coins, which suffered from heavy counterfeiting. Coins were released almost every year alongside proof versions up to 1982 when production of uncirculated sovereigns was discontinued, though proof examples continued to be minted. In 1987, the mint started to produce a new type of bullion coin: the gold one-ounce Britannia coin with a face value of £100. A silver version valued at £2 was also released in 1997. Production of the previously discontinued uncirculated sovereigns and half sovereigns resumed in 2000. From 2014, a lunar coin series was minted annually in celebration of the Lunar New Year; and in 2016, a series featuring The Queen&#x27;s Beasts began.

=== Medals ===
On occasion, the mint produces medals for government departments and under private contracts for clients such as royal societies, colleges, and universities. Most notably, the mint has made OBE medals as well as many military honours, including the Defence Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for the British Armed Forces. For the 2012 Summer Olympics, the mint won a contract to produce 4,700 gold, silver and bronze medals for competitors.

Before 1851, the making of medals at the mint was at the discretion of engravers who could undertake the work independently and receive an additional wage. A royal patent issued in 1669 granted the mint the sole right to produce medals of any metal that bore a monarch&#x27;s portrait. Engravers would use the facilities at the mint to make commemorative medals of their own design for sale. A key date in the mint&#x27;s history of producing medals for the military is 1815, when the Battle of Waterloo marked the beginning of awarding military campaign medals. By 1874, the mint was responsible for making all bars and clasps for war medals in the country and was making campaign medals such as the New Zealand War Service Medal, the Abyssinian War Medal, and the Ashantee Medal.

At the start of the First World War, military medals were manufactured by the Woolwich Arsenal and private contractors. However, in 1922, a new medal unit created by the mint became the sole manufacturer of all Royal and State medals and decorations in metal, except the Victoria Cross, which is made by Hancocks &amp; Co. Before 2010, all British military medals were made by the mint; however, they now must compete with other manufacturers.

==Trial of the Pyx==

The Trial of the Pyx is a traditional procedure to test newly minted coins for conformity to required standards. The trials have been held since the 12th century, normally once per calendar year. The form of the ceremony has been essentially the same since 1282. They are trials in the full judicial sense, presided over by a judge with an expert jury of assayers. The trials have since 1871 taken place at the livery hall of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, having previously taken place at the Palace of Westminster. Given modern production methods, it is unlikely that coins would not conform, although this has been a problem in the past as it would have been tempting for the Master of the Mint or others to steal precious metals.

The term &quot;pyx&quot; refers to the boxwood chest (in Greek πυξίς, &quot;pyxis&quot;) in which coins were placed for presentation to the jury. There is also a Pyx Chapel (or Pyx Chamber) in Westminster Abbey which was once used for secure storage of the Pyx and related articles.

Coins to be tested are drawn from the regular production of the Royal Mint. The Deputy Master of the Mint must, throughout the year, randomly select a fixed proportion of the coins produced and set the samples aside for the trial. For example, for every 5,000 bimetallic coins issued one must be set aside, but for silver Maundy money the proportion is one in 150.

The trial today consists of an inquiry independent of the Royal Mint.

The jury is composed of freemen of the Company of Goldsmiths, who assay the coins provided to decide whether they have been minted within the criteria determined by the relevant Coinage Acts.

<text>Shaftesbury Abbey was an abbey that housed nuns in Shaftesbury, Dorset. It was founded in about 888, and dissolved in 1539 during the English Reformation by the order of Thomas Cromwell, minister to King Henry VIII. At the time it was the second-wealthiest nunnery in England, behind only Syon Abbey.

==History==
Alfred the Great founded the convent in about 888 and installed his daughter Æthelgifu as the first abbess. Ælfgifu, the wife of Alfred&#x27;s grandson, King Edmund I, was buried at Shaftesbury and soon venerated as a saint, and she came to be regarded by the house as its true founder.

The bones of St Edward the Martyr were translated from Wareham and received at the abbey with great ceremony. The translation of the relics was overseen by St Dunstan and Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia. This occurred in a great procession beginning on 13 February 981; the relics arrived at Shaftesbury seven days later. The relics were received by the nuns of the abbey and were buried with full royal honours on the north side of the altar. The account of the translation reports that on the way from Wareham to Shaftesbury, a miracle had taken place: when two crippled men were brought close to the bier and those carrying it lowered the body to their level, the cripples were immediately restored to full health. This procession and events were re-enacted 1000 years later in 1981. Reports from Shaftesbury of many other miracles said to have been obtained through Edward&#x27;s intercession helped establish the abbey as a place of pilgrimage.

In 1001, it was recorded that the tomb in which St Edward lay was observed regularly to rise from the ground. King Æthelred instructed the bishops to raise his brother&#x27;s tomb from the ground and place it into a more fitting place. The bishops moved the relics to a casket, placed in the holy place of the saints together with other holy relics. This elevation of the relics of Edward took place on 20 June 1001.

Shaftesbury Abbey was rededicated to the Mother of God and St Edward. Many miracles were claimed at the tomb of St Edward, including the healing of lepers and the blind. The abbey became the wealthiest Benedictine nunnery in England, a major pilgrimage site, and the town&#x27;s central focus. A large grange, Place Farm was established at Tisbury to administer the abbey’s Wiltshire estates. William of Malmesbury, in his &quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot;, praised the abbey residents&#x27; &quot;steadfast preservation of their purity&quot; and the fervency and effectiveness of their prayers. In 1093, shortly before his election as archbishop, Anselm of Canterbury wrote a letter to Eulalia, who was abbess at the time, requesting their prayers for him; medieval scholar and historian Katie Ann-Marie Bugyis states that it demonstrates his &quot;confidence in the promptness and solicitude&quot; of their prayers. Anselm wrote another letter to Shaftesbury ten years later, which suggests that Eulalia had responded to him and told him that the community had granted his request for prayer; he also thanked them for their prayers for him during his exile from England and asked for their continued intercession as he returned.

In 1240 Cardinal Otto Candidus, the legate to the Apostolic See of Pope Gregory IX, visited the abbey and confirmed a charter of 1191, the first entered in the Glastonbury chartulary. Elizabeth de Burgh, Queen of Scots was imprisoned here from October 1312 to March 1313. By 1340, the steward of the abbess swore in the town&#x27;s mayor.

===Dissolution===
At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, a common saying quoted by Bishop Thomas Fuller conjectured &quot;if the abbess of Shaftesbury and the abbot of Glastonbury Abbey had been able to wed, their son would have been richer than the King of England&quot; because of the lands which it had been bequeathed. It was too rich a prize for Thomas Cromwell to pass up on behalf of King Henry VIII.

In 1539, the last abbess, Elizabeth Zouche, signed a deed of surrender, the abbey was demolished, and its lands sold, leading to a temporary decline in the town. Sir Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour purchased the abbey and much of the town in 1540, but when he was later exiled for treason his lands were forfeit, and the lands passed to the earl of Pembroke then to Anthony Ashley Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, and finally to the Grosvenors.

===Burials===
*Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury
*Edward the Martyr

==In literature==
Thomas Hardy wrote of the abbey ruins:
Vague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent apsidal Abbey, the chief glory of south Wessex, its twelve churches, its shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions—all now ruthlessly swept away—throw the visitor, even against his will, into a pensive melancholy which the stimulating atmosphere and limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel.

A novel based on the dissolution of the abbey, &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, by Victoria Glendinning was published in 2018.

Shaftesbury Abbey appears in &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;, the final part of Hilary Mantel&#x27;s trilogy covering the life of Thomas Cromwell, published in 2020. There is an important scene where Cromwell meets Dorothea Clancy/Dorothy Clusey, the illegitimate daughter of Cardinal Wolsey, and Abbess Elizabeth Zouche. Both nuns are real historical figures, though it is not known whether Cromwell ever visited Shaftesbury Abbey.

&quot;Matrix&quot; is a 2021 historical novel by Lauren Groff about Abbess Mary of Shaftesbury, supposed by some historians to be the author Marie de France.

<doc id="274402" wikidata="Q2920505" url="?curid=274402" title="Aharon Kotler">
<text>Aharon Kotler (February 2, 1892 – November 29, 1962) was a Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) rabbi and a prominent leader of Orthodox Judaism in Lithuania and in the United States, where he founded Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood Township, New Jersey.

== Early life ==
Kotler was born Aharon Pines in Śvisłač, Russian Empire (historically Lithuania, now Belarus) in 1892. He was orphaned at the age of 10 and adopted by his uncle, Yitzchak Pines, a rabbinic judge in Minsk. He studied in the Slabodka yeshiva in Lithuania under Nosson Tzvi Finkel, and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. 

== Career ==
Kotler joined his father-in-law, Isser Zalman Meltzer, in running the yeshiva of Slutsk. After World War I, the yeshiva moved from Slutsk to Kletsk in Belarus. With the outbreak of World War II, Kotler and the yeshiva relocated to Vilna, then the major refuge of most yeshivas from the occupied areas. The smaller yeshivas followed the lead of the larger ones, and either escaped with them to Japan and China, or were arrested by the communists and sent to Siberia or Kazakhstan. Most of his students did not manage to escape and were murdered by the Nazis. He was brought to America on April 10, 1941, by the Vaad Hatzalah rescue organization, and guided it during the Holocaust. At first, he settled in New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side, and in 1949, he moved to the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.

In 1943, Kotler founded Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, with 15 students. By the time of his death in 1962, the yeshiva had grown to 250 students. He was succeeded by his son, Shneur Kotler, as rosh yeshiva (dean). As of 2011, Beth Medrash Govoha is run by his grandson, Malkiel Kotler, and three of his grandsons-in-law, Yerucham Olshin, Yisroel Neuman, and Dovid Schustal. By 2019 the yeshiva had grown into the largest institution of its kind in the United States with 6,715 students, 2,748 regular and 3,967 in Kollel status. while the surrounding Lakewood community supports a network of more than 100 other yeshivas and approximately 200 synagogues for an Orthodox population estimated at more than 66,000.

Upon the death of his father-in-law, Kotler inherited the latter&#x27;s position of rosh yeshiva of Etz Chaim Yeshiva of Jerusalem. In an unusual arrangement, he held this position while continuing to live in the United States, and visiting Jerusalem occasionally. Today, his grandson, Zevulun Schwartzman, heads a located at Etz Chaim Yeshiva.

== Activism ==

Following his arrival in the United States, Kotler joined the presidium of the Vaad Hatzalah, working feverishly to save rabbis and yeshiva students who were trapped in Europe. Along with Eliezer Silver, Avraham Kalmanowitz and others, he worked day and night, using both private and government channels to try and save lives. A committed anti-Zionist, Kotler also helped establish Chinuch Atzmai, the independent religious school system in Israel, and was the chairman of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Agudath Israel. He chaired the Rabbinical administration board of Torah Umesorah, and was on the presidium of the Agudas HaRabbonim of the U.S. and Canada.

Some of those noted Jewish activists who supported Kotler in his efforts were Irving Bunim, Moses Feuerstein, Stephen Klein and Zev Wolfson.

== Death ==
Kotler died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City on November 29, 1962. A funeral service at the Congregation Sons of Israel Kalwarier on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side drew 25,000 mourners, with 200 officers from the New York City Police Department assigned to the event. Kotler was buried in Israel on Har HaMenuchot.

<doc id="274422" wikidata="Q3135895" url="?curid=274422" title="A303 road">
<text>The A303 is a trunk road in southern England, running between Basingstoke in Hampshire and Honiton in Devon via Stonehenge. Connecting the M3 and the A30, it is part of one of the main routes from London to Devon and Cornwall. It is a primary A road throughout its length, passing through five counties.

The road has evolved from historical routes, some of which are thousands of years old, including the Harrow Way and the Fosse Way. The modern route was first laid out in the early 19th century as the New Direct Road, a faster coaching route from London to Exeter. It was initially in demand but fell into disuse as railways became popular from the 1840s onwards. It was not thought of as a significant through route when roads were initially numbered, but was revived as a major road in 1933, eventually becoming a trunk road in 1958. Since then, the A303 has gradually been upgraded to modern standards, though there are still several unimproved parts with longstanding plans to fix them.

As a primary route to southwestern England, the A303 is frequently congested on its single carriageway sections. It passes through the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and attempts to upgrade the road in those areas have been controversial. In particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which would see the A303 rerouted underground, has been proposed and delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving.

==Route==

The A303 is about long. It starts at the M3 motorway south of Basingstoke at Junction 8, as a dual carriageway. It heads south-west, crossing the A34 near Bullington before passing south of Andover. The road then passes by Solstice Park and Bulford Camp before bypassing Amesbury and entering the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. The route then becomes single carriageway before passing Stonehenge itself. The presence of the road through a World Heritage Site has been controversial for decades. As part of a long-term strategy to restore a natural landscape around Stonehenge, the A344 road which once joined the A303 at Stonehenge has been removed, following the removal of other features over the last century including the Stonehenge Aerodrome which used to span the A303 around west of the henge.

After Winterbourne Stoke the route once again becomes dual carriageway from Yarnbury Castle and across the Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single carriageway road, coming out of the valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton, then north of Sparkford before bypassing Ilchester and RNAS Yeovilton. Between Ilchester and Shores Bridge (over the River Parrett, east of South Petherton) the road follows the course of the Roman Fosse Way. At Yeovilton the road connects with the A37 which joins it until it reaches the end of the bypass. The dual carriageway ends at South Petherton. It runs north of Ilminster as a three-lane single carriageway where it meets the A358, providing access to the M5 motorway.

The A303 is of a lower standard west of Ilminster. It passes through the Blackdown Hills as a narrow road following the contours of the land, with the exception of a dual-carriageway bypass of Marsh. The end of the A303 is reached where it joins the A30, which enters as a side road and continues as the main route for Honiton and Exeter.

The A303 roughly parallels the West of England line, which competes for long-distance traffic. Although the A303 as a whole is designed to be part of a route from London to Exeter, a popular alternative is to take the M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5. This is a high-quality motorway route throughout, but a considerably longer distance.

==History==

===Early history===
Parts of the A303, such as the section past Stonehenge, have been a right of way for people, wagons, and later motor vehicles for millennia. Portions of it follow the Harrow Way, an ancient trackway across Wessex that is one of Britain&#x27;s oldest roads, reportedly being used as long ago as 3,000 BC. Other sections run on part of the Fosse Way, a Roman road between Exeter and Lincoln constructed around 49 AD.

A section of the A303 around Weyhill, west of Andover, runs alongside a ditch thought to be constructed during the Bronze Age. Several historic roads converged at Weyhill, which is believed to have hosted a popular market since the Middle Ages, eventually becoming one of the most important in England by the 19th century. The market closed in the 1950s.

===19th century===
The modern course of the A303 was designed in the early 19th century as the &quot;New Direct Road&quot; by William Hanning, chief engineer of the Ilminster Turnpike Trust, in order to improve coaching traffic to southwest England. Russells of Exeter began a coach service along it, though they quickly reverted to the older coaching route further south (now part of the A30). Along with engineer Goldsworthy Gurney, Hanning attempted to design a steam-powered coach that could be run along the New Direct Road. After an experimental round trip to Bath, he invested £10,000 in steam carriages. Sir Charles Dance bought three carriages for trips between Cheltenham and Gloucester, but traditional horse-operated stagecoach operators sabotaged the route and Hanning&#x27;s carriages did not gain widespread adoption. Nevertheless, the New Direct Road became increasingly used as a coaching route between London and Exeter in the 1820s. Ann Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Exeter Telegraph&quot;, a coach from London to Devon via the New Direct Road, could travel from Piccadilly to Devonport in a little over 21 hours. It remained a popular coaching route until the arrival of railways in the 1840s.

The widespread adoption of railways during railway mania caused coaching services to dry up. Along with many other turnpike routes, the New Direct Road fell into disrepair during the 19th century owing to a lack of funds and available staff. By the turn of the 20th century, it had become little more than a rough track in places, making it difficult to drive on.

===20th century===
Road designations were first allocated by the Ministry of Transport in the early 1920s, but the New Direct Road was not initially considered a major through route. Instead, the older coaching road further south via Salisbury and Yeovil was determined to be the main road. Maps produced by companies independent to the Ordnance Survey, the Government&#x27;s official mapping body, marked the New Direct Road as a &quot;class I&quot; route anyway.

The A303 was created on 1 April 1933 as the &quot;Alternative London – Exeter route&quot; after the Ministry of Transport realised the New Direct Road was still useful as a major road for motor traffic. The route created a long bypass for sections of the A30 that ran south of it.

In 1958, the Ministry of Transport upgraded the A303 to trunk road status. It believed it was easier to upgrade than the parallel A30 as it passed through fewer towns. Initial improvements to the road in the 1960s included widening small sections to 3 lanes (forming the so-called suicide lane) or to dual carriageway; but none were longer than . Andover and Amesbury were bypassed in 1969, while general improvements to the road, including additional dualling, took place throughout the 1970s.
In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker announced the entire length of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual carriageway upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely uninterrupted dual carriageway westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.

=== 21st century===

In 2013, after decades of debate, the A303&#x27;s junction with the A344, just east of Stonehenge, was closed as part of improvements to visitor facilities. During this work, a roadside monument was moved to the visitor centre; the stone monument is to Captain Eustace Loraine and Staff-Sergeant Richard Wilson, killed in July 1912 in the first fatal accident of the recently formed Royal Flying Corps.
==Traffic==

Since the 1950s, the A303 has been criticised for being inadequate for the level of traffic along it. In 1959, it was reported that a typical queue for holiday traffic along the road could be as much as . In 2017, over of the road west of Amesbury remains single carriageway, interrupted by various sections of dual carriageway. The switches between the latter to the former act as bottlenecks and are major sources of congestion along the route. Upgrading the remaining sections of road is difficult due to environmental concerns; in 1986, an upgrade of the A303 in Hampshire caused public outcry after the work destroyed the remains of an Iron Age settlement, and consequently, £100,000 was spent on emergency rescue excavation work.

The A303 is particularly congested during the Summer solstice (around 21 June), when Stonehenge forms a major part of festivities. During the so-called &quot;Battle of Stonehenge&quot; on 1 June 1985, where 520 people clashed violently with police, roadblocks were set up over a radius around the site. A convoy of trucks managed to break through a block at Cholderton, leading to increased violence. Conflicts were repeated for several years in the 1980s; in 1988 a van overturned on the A303 after leaving a clash with police at Stonehenge, killing one passenger and injuring ten others. As well as Stonehenge, the A303 is part of one of the main routes from London to the Glastonbury Festival. During the weekend of the festival in late June, the road is generally gridlocked as people drive towards or away from the festival grounds in Pilton.

The Government&#x27;s Road Investment Strategy has committed to upgrading all the remaining single carriage sections of the A303 as far as Ilminster. Highways England have made numerous proposals to improve the road, and it is currently identified under several Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects.

==Future==

===Stonehenge area===
The most controversial upgrade of the A303 has been improvement to the road through the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, where it remains a congested single carriageway road. There were minor changes in the 1960s, including closing the road for a month in 1967 for levelling and resurfacing. A proposal to fully dual the A303 past Stonehenge was announced in the mid-1970s, but was criticised as being &quot;an environmental disaster&quot; and comparable to driving a dual carriageway through Westminster Abbey. A more comprehensive solution was discussed in 1989&#x27;s Roads for Prosperity programme, which included upgrading the road to dual carriageway and bypassing Winterborne Stoke. In 1993, the Minister for Roads, Kenneth Carlisle, announced plans for either a tunnel or a diversion of the A303 a mile from Stonehenge, costing £44 million and £22 million respectively. Although the new Labour government cancelled many road schemes after coming to power in 1997, there was still general support for a tunnel at Stonehenge.
In 2003, of improvements, including the proposed road tunnel bored under land adjacent to Stonehenge, were announced by the Secretary of State for Transport as part of a package of road upgrades. A public enquiry into whether the plans were adequate was announced; it concluded that they were, despite protests from charities and landowners that the tunnel should be longer. Two years later, it was announced that there was to be a review of the options for Stonehenge, starting in January 2006, as costs had doubled. The government cancelled the whole scheme at the end of 2007 owing to excessive environmental constraints.

In 2016, the Stonehenge tunnel was revived by the Government, who awarded a £17.5m design contract to build a tunnel. Local residents were pleased with the news, but a survey suggested 90% still preferred a diversion away from the stones instead. The plan was finalised the following year as part of a £2 billion programme. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the improvements would &quot;transform&quot; the A303 and would be important for removing congestion. In November 2020, the plans were confirmed again in a report by Transport Secretary Andrew Stephenson, and endorsed by Highways England. Though the Government said it had carefully listened to all opinions on the tunnel, the decision to proceed was condemned by environmental campaigners.

In July 2021, the tunnel proposals were overturned in the High Court of Justice. A hearing concluded that transport secretary Grant Shapps had &quot;acted irrationally and unlawfully&quot; by backing the project and failed to properly assess the environmental impacts of each asset on the Stonehenge World Heritage Site as required by planning law. Campaigners for the Stonehenge Alliance welcomed the decision, but Historic England expressed frustration over the &quot;missed opportunity to remove the intrusive sight and sound of traffic past the iconic monument&quot;. The Department for Transport reinstated the scheme in July 2023, but the campaigners against the tunnel challenged it in December in the High Court. The case was lost the following February, when the court upheld the government&#x27;s decision.

The village of Winterbourne Stoke is immediately west of the World Heritage Site, and proposals to upgrade the A303 in this area have generally provided a bypass for it. There have also been proposals to build a bypass as a standalone project, without requiring the improvements around Stonehenge.

===A303/A358 South Petherton to M5 Taunton===
In November 2004, plans to improve the route through the Blackdown Hills (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) were abandoned in favour of upgrading the A358 from Ilminster to the M5 motorway at Taunton to reduce traffic west of Ilminster. The scheme was the subject of a public consultation in March 2007, and incorporated plans to widen the Ilminster bypass from South Petherton to a dual two-lane road. The plans were shelved in 2009 when it was concluded that the dualling could not be funded from the Regional Funding Allocation for the South West. In 2016, the plans were revived by Highways England, with a final decision expected to be announced the following year.

In 2019, the preferred route of the A358 upgrade was revealed, and in 2020 the government confirmed funding for the A358 scheme and dualling of the A303 between Sparkford and Podimore.

===Other schemes===
A number of other schemes for the remaining below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh, and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were later remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.

In 2016, Devon County Council announced they would self-fund improvements to the A303 between Ilminster and Honiton, which was not included in Highways England&#x27;s list. The council put together three proposals for alternative routes, with the aim of securing £170 million of Government funding once a preferred route is chosen.

Plans to improve the A303 between Sparkford and Ilchester by upgrading three miles of single carriageway to high-quality dual carriageway were approved by the government in February 2021. Work began on this section that October.

==Cultural references==

Kula Shaker performed their first impromptu gig at the Glastonbury Festival, which can be reached via the A303. The road was the inspiration for the song &quot;303&quot; on their debut album &quot;K&quot;. The road was also mentioned in the Levellers&#x27; song &quot;Battle of the Beanfield&quot;, about the attack by police on travellers celebrating the Solstice at Stonehenge (1 June 1985): &quot;Down the &#x27;303 at the end of the road, Flashing lights, exclusion zones&quot;.

Prior to the broadcast of Series 15 of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2010, the cast of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May were spotted and recorded driving along the A303 in what appeared to be house cars. The video was recorded and put on YouTube.

In 2011, BBC Four broadcast the documentary &quot;A303 Highway to the Sun&quot;. The writer Tom Fort drove the length of the A303 in a Morris Traveller, making various stops. The following year, he published a book with the same title; it covers the history of the road, and British road planning, together with landscape, history and general travel writing. During research, one interviewee recommended using the A303 to reach southwest England, adding it was &quot;less boring than the motorway, and you&#x27;ve always got Stonehenge&quot;. The programme was praised for its eclecticism and enthusiasm for what could have been a tedious subject.

==Junctions and landmarks==
There are a wide variety of junctions on the A303. These range from motorway-style free-flowing junctions such as that with the A36 near Wylye, to simple forks on the single carriageway sections.

Some junctions, such as the Countess Roundabout with the A345 near Amesbury, and the Podimore roundabout with the A37, are known congestion hotspots because they are insufficient to cope with traffic. Other former junctions, such as the A344 near Stonehenge, have been removed in order to help traffic flow and avoid congestion and accidents.

<text>Oscar Pettiford (September 30, 1922 – September 8, 1960) was an American jazz double bassist and composer. He was one of the earliest musicians to work in the bebop idiom.

Jazz bassist Christian McBride called Pettiford &quot;probably the most important bass player of that bebop generation in terms of creating new language for the bass.&quot;

==Early life==

Pettiford was born in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, United States. His mother identified as being of Choctaw descent, and his father Harry &quot;Doc&quot; Pettiford identified as half Cherokee and half African-American.

He grew up playing in the family band, in which he sang and danced before switching to piano at the age of 12, then to double bass when he was 14. Jamela Pettiford, a singer in St. Paul, Minnesota, and a descendant of the Pettiford family, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2022 that the Pettiford family band traveled itinerantly for a time as road musicians before settling in north Minneapolis.

Pettiford is quoted as saying that he did not like the way people were playing the bass, so he developed his own way of playing it. Despite being admired by the likes of Milt Hinton at the age of 14, he gave up in 1941 because he did not believe he could make a living. Five months later, he once again met Hinton, who persuaded him to return to music.

==Career==
In 1942, Pettiford joined the Charlie Barnet band and in 1943 gained wider public attention after recording with Coleman Hawkins on his &quot;The Man I Love&quot;. Pettiford also recorded with Earl Hines and Ben Webster around this time. After he moved to New York, he was one of the musicians (together with Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Kenny Clarke) who in the early 1940s jammed at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse, where the music style developed that was later called bebop. Pettiford and Dizzy Gillespie led a bop group in 1943. In 1945, Pettiford went with Hawkins to California, where he appeared in &quot;The Crimson Canary&quot;, a mystery movie known for its jazz soundtrack, which also featured Josh White. He then worked with Duke Ellington from 1945 to 1948 and for Woody Herman in 1949, before working mainly as a leader in the 1950s.

As a leader, he inadvertently discovered Cannonball Adderley. After one of his musicians had tricked him into letting Adderley, an unknown music teacher, onto the stand, he had Adderley solo on a demanding piece, on which Adderley performed impressively.

Pettiford is considered the pioneer of the cello as a solo instrument in jazz music. He first played the cello as a practical joke on his band leader (Woody Herman), when he walked off stage during his solo spot and came back, unexpectedly with a cello and played on that. In 1949, after suffering a broken arm, Pettiford found it impossible to play his bass, so he experimented with a cello a friend had lent him. Tuning it in fourths, like a double bass, but one octave higher, Pettiford found it possible to perform during his rehabilitation (during which time his arm was in a sling) and made his first recordings with the instrument in 1950. The cello thus became his secondary instrument, and he continued to perform and record with it throughout the remainder of his career.

He recorded extensively during the 1950s for the Debut, Bethlehem and ABC Paramount labels, among others. During the mid-1950s, he played on the first three albums that Thelonious Monk recorded for the Riverside label.

Between 1954 and 1958, Pettiford also led sextets, big bands and jazz orchestras which played dates in Manhattan venues like Birdland, where he continued to explore unusual instrumental voicing including French horns and harp. The reedist and composer Gigi Gryce collaborated with Pettiford on the novel arrangements for the orchestra&#x27;s hi-fi albums.

In 1958, Pettiford moved to Copenhagen, Denmark, and started recording for European companies. After his move to Europe, he often performed with European musicians, such as Attila Zoller, and also with other Americans who had settled in Europe, including Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke.

Pettiford&#x27;s influence on bassists of ensuing generations is frequently noted; his composition &quot;Tricotism&quot; is a standard piece of jazz bass repertoire, and has been recorded by several generations of bassists, including Ray Brown, Milt Hinton, Rufus Reid, John Clayton, Bill Crow, Yasushi Nakamura, and others.

==Death==
Pettiford died in 1960 in Copenhagen, shortly before his 38th birthday, from a virus closely related to polio.

<doc id="274439" wikidata="Q376249" url="?curid=274439" title="X11 color names">
<text>In computing, on the X Window System, X11 color names are represented in a simple text file, which maps certain strings to RGB color values. It was traditionally shipped with every X11 installation, hence the name, and is usually located in codice_1. The web colors list is descended from it but differs for certain color names.

Color names are not standardized by Xlib or the X11 protocol. The list does not show continuity either in selected color values or in color names, and some color triplets have multiple names. Despite this, graphic designers and others got used to them, making it practically impossible to introduce a different list. In earlier releases of X11 (prior to the introduction of Xcms), server implementors were encouraged to modify the RGB values in the reference color database to account for gamma correction.

As of X.Org Release 7.4 rgb.txt is no longer included in the roll up release, and the list is built directly into the server. The optional module xorg/app/rgb contains the stand-alone rgb.txt file.

The list first shipped with X10 release 3 (X10R3) on 7 June 1986, having been checked into RCS by Jim Gettys in 1985. The same list was in X11R1 on 18 September 1987. Approximately the full list as is available today shipped with X11R4 on 29 January 1989, with substantial additions by Paul Ravelling (who added colors based on Sinclair Paints samples), John C. Thomas (who added colors based on a set of 72 Crayola crayons he had on hand) and Jim Fulton (who reconciled contributions to produce the X11R4 list). The project was running DEC VT240 terminals at the time, so would have worked to that device.

In some applications multipart names are written with spaces, in others joined together, often in camel case. They are usually matched insensitive of case and the X Server source code contains spaced aliases for most entries; this article uses spaces and uppercase initials except where variants with spaces are not specified in the actual code.

== Clashes between web and X11 colors in the CSS color scheme ==

The first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 colors as the basis for the web colors list, as both were originally X applications. The W3C specifications SVG and CSS level 3 module Color eventually adopted the X11 list with some changes. The present W3C list is a superset of the 16 &quot;VGA colors&quot; defined in HTML 3.2 and CSS level 1.

One notable difference between X11 and W3C is the case of &quot;Gray&quot; and its variants. In HTML, &quot;Gray&quot; is specifically reserved for the 128 triplet (50% gray) . However, in X11, &quot;gray&quot; was assigned to the 190 triplet (74.5%) , which is close to W3C &quot;Silver&quot; at 192 (75.3%) , and had &quot;Light Gray&quot; at 211 (83%) and &quot;Dark Gray&quot; at 169 (66%) counterparts. As a result, the combined CSS 3.0 color list that prevails on the web today produces &quot;Dark Gray&quot; as a significantly lighter tone than plain &quot;Gray&quot; , because &quot;Dark Gray&quot; was descended from X11 – for it did not exist in HTML nor CSS level 1 – while &quot;Gray&quot; was descended from HTML. Even in the current draft for CSS 4.0, dark gray continues to be a lighter shade than gray. Some browsers such as Netscape Navigator insisted on an &quot;a&quot; in any &quot;Gr&quot;a&quot;y&quot; except for &quot;Light Gr&quot;e&quot;y&quot;.

Recent X releases (since 2014, xorg-rgb version 1.0.6) also support the W3C definitions. In X11, the original definitions have been preserved (so &quot;Dark Gray&quot; remains a darker shade of &quot;Gray&quot;), but for every conflicting name pair, &quot;Web&quot; and additional &quot;X11&quot; prefixes have been added to ease disambiguation after the merger. The &quot;X11&quot; prefix is an alias for the non-prefixed version, i.e. &quot;X11 Gray&quot; = &quot;Gray&quot; ≠ &quot;Web Gray&quot;. The W3C also defined a color that is equal to X11&#x27;s &quot;Green&quot;, but called it &quot;Lime&quot;. In X11, this is simply called &quot;Lime&quot;, as no such name existed before. It aliases to &quot;Green&quot;, i.e. &quot;Lime&quot; = &quot;Green&quot; = &quot;X11 Green&quot; ≠ &quot;Web Green&quot;.



== Color name chart ==
The following chart presents the standardized X11 color names from the X.org source code. The list of names accepted by browsers following W3C standards slightly differs as explained above. The table does not show numbered gray and brightness variants as described below. Actual codice_2 files and other color databases or palettes may differ since they are freely editable by vendors and users. The table shows component values in several notations of the RGB color space, with conversions to HSL and HSV assuming sRGB color space.

The complete codice_2 defines 101 shades from &#x27;Gray0&#x27; (black) up to &#x27;Gray100&#x27; (white) in addition to &#x27;Gray&#x27; and its variants listed above. The shades are apparently defined by the formula codice_4 resulting in e.g. &#x27;Gray96&#x27; , which happens to be the same as &#x27;White Smoke&#x27;. Similarly &#x27;Dim Gray&#x27; is the same as &#x27;Gray41&#x27; .

On the other hand, &#x27;Gray&#x27; lies between &#x27;Gray74&#x27; and &#x27;Gray75&#x27; ; &#x27;Dark Gray&#x27; is not the same as &#x27;Gray66&#x27; ; and &#x27;Light Gray&#x27; is not the same as &#x27;Gray83&#x27; .

These shades are not included in W3C specifications, although drafts for level 4 of the CSS Color module include a similar function codice_5.
They are still coded without &#x27;Grey&#x27; alternatives, but with no space before the digit.

=== Numbered variants ===
For 78 colors (not counting grays), codice_2 offers four variants &quot;&quot;color&quot;1&quot;, &quot;&quot;color&quot;2&quot;, &quot;&quot;color&quot;3&quot;, and &quot;&quot;color&quot;4&quot;, with &quot;&quot;color&quot;1&quot; sometimes corresponding to &quot;color&quot;, so e.g. &quot;Snow1&quot; is the same as &quot;Snow&quot;. Unlike base colors, e.g. codice_7 and codice_8, these are only coded without spaces, e.g. codice_9. These variations are neither supported by popular browsers nor adopted by W3C standards. Whether or not a certain color has such variants seems random.

If &quot;&quot;color&quot;1&quot; is not the same as &quot;&quot;color&quot;, the base color is usually darker. That means its brightness in HSB color notation is less than 100%; about 30 of the base colors are fully bright. The four variants (1...4) have rounded brightness values of 100%, 93%, 80% and 55%, respectively. Their hue and saturation are usually the same except for rounding. In some cases they differ from the base color, though, which may indicate that these variants were specified with alternate definitions of the bases in mind, i.e. their values were adapted to a certain monitor which was commonly done by vendors until the 1990s.

The fixed brightness settings correspond closely to these formulae to determine the RGB values:

codice_10

codice_11

codice_12

codice_13

Examples:
* &quot;Yellow 2&quot; (238, 238, 0) is based on &quot;Yellow&quot; (255, 255, 0) with 255 × 0.932 = 237.66.
* &quot;Ivory 3&quot; (205, 205, 193) is explained by &quot;Ivory&quot; (255, 255, 240) where 255 × 0.804 = 205.02 and 240 × 0.804 = 192.96.
* &quot;Azure 4&quot; (131, 139, 139) is close to &quot;Azure&quot; (240, 255, 255) values transformed as 255 × 0.548 = 139.74 and 240 × 0.548 = 131.52.

=== Prefixed variants ===
Some color names appear to be brightness or saturation modifications of others because they bear prefixes such as &quot;Dark, Light, Medium, Pale&quot; or &quot;Deep&quot;, but there is no systematic variation apparent. Several sets, however, feature a &quot;Dark&quot; variant with 55% brightness and some have their &quot;Medium&quot; at about 80%.

&quot;Light Goldenrod Yellow&quot; and &quot;Dark Olive Green&quot; are special, because there are no corresponding color entries without &quot;Dark&quot; and &quot;Light&quot; prefixes.

=== Nuances with different hue ===
Several groups of colors share the same lightness or brightness and saturation. These &quot;nuances&quot; differ only by hue.

; 350–351°/100%: 88% Pink, 86% Light Pink

=== Tones with different saturation ===
Some pairs of colors share the same lightness and hue. These &quot;tones&quot; differ only by saturation. Tones are far less common in the X11 set than nuances, tints and shades.

; 0°/41%: 0% Dim Gray, 59% Brown
; 120°/50%: 61% Lime Green, 100% Green / Lime
; 180°/25%: 25% Dark Slate Gray, 100% Teal
; 240°/27%: 64% Midnight Blue, 100% Dark Blue

== Derived lists ==

The Printer Working Group (PWG) of the IEEE publishes a standard, PWG 5101.1, whose mandatory color names are based upon , successor to which imported the functional color names &quot;other&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;transparent&quot; alongside seven basic colors from ISO 10175 (DPA) and ISO 10180 (SPDL), and JTAPI. This standard has four variants for each non-monochromatic color: &quot;clear&quot; (50% transparent), &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;light&quot; and the default. Wherever possible, the values are the same as in the W3C adaptation of the X11 list, except for Turquoise which is instead of . Missing variant values have been added systematically. &quot;Buff&quot; and &quot;Mustard&quot; are completely new color names. Light Black and Gray correspond to the same color.

<text>Popular science (also called pop-science or popsci) is an interpretation of science intended for a general audience. While science journalism focuses on recent scientific developments, popular science is more broad ranging. It may be written by professional science journalists or by scientists themselves. It is presented in many forms, including books, film and television documentaries, magazine articles, and web pages.

== History==
Before the modern specialization and professionalization of science, there was often little distinction between &quot;science&quot; and &quot;popular science&quot;, and works intended to share scientific knowledge with a general reader existed as far back as Greek and Roman antiquity. Without these popular works, much of the scientific knowledge of the era might have been lost. For example, none of the original works of the Greek astronomer Eudoxus (4th century BC) have survived, but his contributions were largely preserved due to the didactic poem &quot;Phenomena&quot; written a century later and commented on by Hipparchus. Explaining science in poetic form was not uncommon, and as recently as 1791, Erasmus Darwin wrote &quot;The Botanic Garden&quot;, two long poems intended to interest and educate readers in botany. Many Greek and Roman scientific handbooks were written for the lay audience, and this &quot;handbook&quot; tradition continued right through to the invention of the printing press, with much later examples including books of secrets such as Giambattista Della Porta&#x27;s &quot;Magia Naturalis&quot; (1558) and Isabella Cortese&#x27;s &quot;Secreti&quot; (1561).

The 17th century saw the beginnings of the modern scientific revolution and the consequent need for explicit popular science writing. Although works such as Galileo&#x27;s &quot;The Assayer&quot; (1632) and Robert Hooke&#x27;s &quot;Micrographia&quot; (1665) were read by both scientists and the public, Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; (1687) was incomprehensible for most readers, so popularizations of Newton&#x27;s ideas soon followed. Popular science writing surged in countries such as France, where books such as Fontenelle&#x27;s &quot;Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds&quot; (1686) were best-sellers.

By 1830, astronomer John Herschel had recognized the need for the specific genre of popular science. In a letter to philosopher William Whewell, he wrote that the general public needed &quot;digests of what is actually known in each particular branch of science... to give a connected view of what has been done, and what remains to be accomplished.&quot; Indeed, as the British population became not just increasingly literate but also well-educated, there was growing demand for science titles. Mary Somerville became an early and highly successful science writer of the nineteenth century. Her &quot;On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences&quot; (1834), intended for the mass audience, sold quite well. Arguably one of the first books in modern popular science, it contained few diagrams and very little mathematics. Ten editions of the book were published, and it was translated into multiple languages. It was the most popular science title from the publisher John Murray until &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859) by Charles Darwin.

== Role ==
Popular science is a bridge between scientific literature as a professional medium of scientific research, and the realms of popular political and cultural discourse. The goal of the genre is often to capture the methods and accuracy of science while making the language more accessible. Many science-related controversies are discussed in popular science books and publications, such as the long-running debates over biological determinism and the biological components of intelligence, stirred by popular books such as &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; and &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;.

The purpose of scientific literature is to inform and persuade peers regarding the validity of observations and conclusions and the forensic efficacy of methods. Popular science attempts to inform and convince scientific outsiders (sometimes along with scientists in other fields) of the significance of data and conclusions and to celebrate the results. Statements in the scientific literature are often qualified and tentative, emphasizing that new observations and results are consistent with and similar to established knowledge wherein qualified scientists are assumed to recognize the relevance. By contrast, popular science emphasizes uniqueness and generality, taking a tone of factual authority absent from the scientific literature.

== Common threads ==
Some usual features of popular science productions include:
* Entertainment value or personal relevance to the audience
* Emphasis on uniqueness and radicalness
* Exploring ideas overlooked by specialists or falling outside established disciplines
* Generalized, simplified science concepts
* Presented for an audience with little or no science background, hence explaining general concepts more thoroughly
* Synthesis of new ideas that cross multiple fields and offer new applications in other academic specialties
* Use of metaphors and analogies to explain difficult or abstract scientific concepts

==Criticism==
The purpose of scientific literature is to inform and persuade peers regarding the validity of observations and conclusions and the forensic efficacy of methods. Popular science attempts to inform and convince scientific outsiders (sometimes along with scientists in other fields) of the significance of data and conclusions and to celebrate the results. Statements in the scientific literature are often qualified and tentative, emphasizing that new observations and results are consistent with and similar to established knowledge wherein qualified scientists are assumed to recognize the relevance. By contrast, popular science often emphasizes uniqueness and generality and may have a tone of factual authority absent from the scientific literature. Comparisons between original scientific reports, derivative science journalism, and popular science typically reveals at least some level of distortion and oversimplification.

<doc id="274441" wikidata="Q2556526" url="?curid=274441" title="Willie Aames">
<text>Albert William Upton, (born July 15, 1960) known professionally as Willie Aames, is an American actor, film and television director, television producer, and screenwriter.

He is best known for playing Tommy Bradford, one of the children of Tom Bradford (played by Dick Van Patten), on the 1970s television series &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, TJ Latimer in &quot;Family&quot;, Buddy Lembeck on the 1980s sitcom &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;, and the title character in the direct-to-video series &quot;Bibleman&quot; (1995–2003). He is also credited as Willie Ames.

==Early life==
Aames was born in Newport Beach, California, in 1960. He attended Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California, and he was in both the choir and the Madrigal Ensemble.

==Career==
Aames began acting in the late 1960s as a child, appearing in shows such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, and &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;. In 1971, he originated the role of Leonard Unger, the son of Felix Unger (Tony Randall), on the ABC-TV series &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, a part that was later played by Leif Garrett.

<text>Happy hardcore, also known as 4-beat or happycore, is a subgenre of hardcore dance music or &quot;hard dance&quot;. It emerged both from the UK breakbeat hardcore rave scene, and Belgian, German and Dutch hardcore techno scenes in the early 1990s. The thing that makes happy hardcore stand apart from gabber, is that happy hardcore tends to have breakbeats running alongside the 4/4 kick drum.

==History==
===Origins===
The breakbeat hardcore rave scene was beginning to fragment by late 1992 into a number of subsequent breakbeat-based genres: darkcore (tracks embracing dark-themed samples and stabs), hardcore jungle (reggae basslines and influences became prominent), and 4-beat also known as &quot;happy hardcore&quot; where piano rolls and uplifting vocals were still central to the sound. DJs such as Slipmatt, DJ Sy, DJ Seduction, Wishdokta, DJ Dougal, and DJ Vibes continued to play and put out music of this nature throughout 1993/94 – notably Slipmatt through the SMD releases, &quot;Wishdokta&quot; as &#x27;Naughty Naughty&#x27;, and &quot;Seduction&quot; on the Impact label.

===1990s growth===
The sound of happy hardcore changed in the 1990s, with tracks increasingly losing their breakbeats towards a stomping distorted 909 4/4 kick drum pattern, with more original vocal leads and stab patterns. DJs and producers that began to come through included Hixxy, Breeze, Force &amp; Styles, DJ Sharkey, and DJ DNA, and tracks that started to define the genre included &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, &quot;Pretty Green Eyes&quot;, &quot;Cloudy Daze&quot;, &quot;Sunshine After the Rain&quot;, &quot;Above the Clouds&quot;, &quot;Discoland&quot;, &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, &quot;Techno Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;Hardcore Fever&quot;. Throughout the mid-late 1990s, the compilation series &quot;Bonkers&quot; would be commercially popular and showcase the latest happy hardcore music. Bonkers only really came into being due to the record label React showing interest in &quot;Toy Town&quot;, and Hixxy and Sharkey convincing the label to do a compilation album deal instead.

===2000s===
In the UK, the scene received its own special on BBC Radio 1 called &quot;John Peel Is Not Enough&quot; (named after a track by CLSM) in 2004. The scene continued to expand, with compilations such as &quot;Clubland X-Treme Hardcore&quot;, and an evermore youthful audience. In 2009, DJ Kutski hosted a show featuring hard dance and hardcore on Radio 1.

==Happy hardcore compilations==
Notable happy hardcore compilation albums include:
* &quot;Bonkers&quot;
* &quot;Clubland X-Treme Hardcore&quot;
* &quot;Dancemania Speed&quot;
* &quot;Happy 2b Hardcore&quot;
* &quot;Hardcore Euphoria&quot;
* &quot;Hardcore Heaven&quot;

<doc id="274449" wikidata="Q3502569" url="?curid=274449" title="Toronto St. Patricks">
<text>The Toronto St. Patricks (colloquially known as the St. Pats) were a professional ice hockey team which began playing in the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1919. The Toronto NHL franchise (league membership) had previously been held by the Arena Company (and the team called the &quot;Arenas&quot;), but despite winning the Stanley Cup the team was bankrupt and pulled out of the league after just two seasons. The rights to the Toronto franchise were purchased by a group of investors with links to an amateur club called the &quot;St. Patricks&quot;. The new owners renamed the NHL franchise after the amateur club, and as the St. Patricks the team won the Stanley Cup in 1922. J.P. Bickell invested in the St. Patricks in 1924 as a favour to Charlie Querrie. In 1927, Charlie Querrie and other investors wanted out, J.P. Bickell made arrangements for other Toronto investors and initially hired Mike Rodden (a referee and sports writer) to run the hockey operations, which did not work out. He then hired Conn Smythe as the Managing Partner. The team was renamed to the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 1926–27 NHL season.

==History==

===Early years===
The St. Pats organization had operated amateur hockey clubs in the Toronto area since the first decade of the 1900s, including the senior amateur St. Patricks team in the Ontario Hockey Association.

The Toronto franchise of the National Hockey League (NHL), since the NHL&#x27;s founding in 1917, had been operated by the Arena Company, operators of the Arena Gardens in Toronto. The Arena Company had been granted a temporary franchise for the 1917–18 season, and leased the players from the Toronto Blueshirts from owner Eddie Livingstone while litigation was underway between Livingstone and the NHL. This temporary franchise won the Stanley Cup in 1918. However, instead of returning the players to Livingstone, the Arena Company formed the Toronto Arena Hockey Club, popularly known as the Toronto Arenas, with Arena Company auditor Hubert Vearncombe as team president. This new organization was duly admitted to the NHL as a full member in good standing, touching off a new round of litigation with Livingstone which forced the Arenas to unload most of their stars. They only won five games in 1918–19, and were forced to suspend operations in February.

Livingstone won a $20,000 judgment against the Arena Company, which declared bankruptcy to avoid paying the bill. Before the 1919–20 season, general manager Charlie Querrie learned that the Arena Company wanted to sell. As an interim measure, Querrie changed the team name to the Tecumsehs on December 7, 1919. The following day, Querrie reached agreement with the owners of the amateur St. Patrick&#x27;s club to purchase the franchise. Frank Heffernan was named as manager. On December 13, 1919, the NHL transferred the Toronto franchise to the Querrie-St. Patricks group, for the fee of $5,000. The incorporation date of the club was December 22, 1919, and listed Fred Hambly, Percy Hambly, Paul Ciceri and Querrie with 99 shares each, and Richard Greer with 4 shares. This move was possible because the Arena Hockey Club was a self-contained corporation, and was therefore beyond the legal reach of Livingstone.
Although Querrie returned, player turnover was nearly 100%, partly because the Quebec NHL franchise was activating for this season, and the players that had been loaned to the Arenas and other NHL teams had been returned to Quebec. Additionally, with the poor performance of the previous season, and the turnover in franchise management, the franchise essentially started over. The club improved to second and third-place finishes in the halves of the schedule.

In 1920–21, the club placed second and first in the schedule halves, enough to make a playoff appearance. Unfortunately, the &#x27;Super Six&#x27; of Ottawa would dominate the club 7–0 in a two-game total goals playoff. The experience would be helpful in the following season, however.

===1922 Stanley Cup champions===

In the 1921–22 season, the St. Pats made their first and only appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. After placing second in the league standings, the club upset first place Ottawa to win the NHL championship and face Vancouver in the final. A fifth and deciding game five was necessary in this series to determine who would win the Cup. After Vancouver won game one, 4–3, Babe Dye scored 4:50 into overtime of game two to give Toronto a 2–1 win. Then in game three, goaltender Hugh Lehman led the Millionaires to a 3–0 shutout win. However, the St. Patricks tied the series in game four, 6–0, as John Ross Roach became the first rookie goaltender to record a Stanley Cup shutout. game five belonged to Toronto as Dye scored four goals in a 5–1 victory to clinch the Cup. For the series, Dye scored nine of the St. Pats 16 goals, while Roach posted a 1.80 goals-against average.

===Later years===

In the following two seasons, the St. Pats would miss the playoffs with third-place finishes. Losing money due to poor attendance, the Hamblys sold their shares in the St. Patricks to Nathan Nathanson, owner of the Famous Players Theatre chain, and mining magnate J. P. Bickell in December 1924.

In 1924–25, the club would place second and play off against the Montreal Canadiens. While Hamilton had played first, the club was on strike, making the St. Pats-Canadiens semi-final the de facto final. The Canadiens would win the playoff to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.

In 1925–26, the club struggled to a sixth placing, finishing behind the expansion Pittsburgh and New York clubs. Top scorer Babe Dye struggled and the club finished sixth out of seven teams. The Canadiens had lost their top goalie Georges Vezina and placed last. In 1926–27, the club finished fifth and last in the new Canadian division. Dye was sold to the new Chicago Black Hawks team for cash.

===Franchise sale and renaming to the Maple Leafs===

The club was in trouble in 1927, both on the ice and legally. Querrie lost a lawsuit to Livingstone and decided, along with major shareholder Nathan Nathanson to put the St. Pats up for sale. There was a $200,000 bid from a group in Philadelphia. However, at shareholder J. P. Bickell&#x27;s direction, the Toronto Varsity Graduates coach Conn Smythe headed an ownership group and made a offer for the majority ownership of the club. With the support of Bickell, who retained his share of the club, the Philadelphia bid was rejected, Smythe arguing that civic pride was more important than money.

After taking control on February 14, 1927, Smythe immediately renamed the team the Toronto Maple Leafs, after the national symbol of Canada. He attributed his choice of a maple leaf for the logo to his experiences as a Canadian Army officer and prisoner of war during World War I. Viewing the maple leaf as a &quot;badge of courage&quot;, and a reminder of home, Smythe decided to give the same name to his hockey team, in honour of the many Canadian soldiers who wore it. However, the team was not the first to use the name. A Toronto minor-league baseball team had used the name &quot;Maple Leafs&quot; since 1895.

Initial reports were that the team&#x27;s colours were to be red and white, but the Leafs wore white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was announced that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white. Although Smythe later stated he chose blue because it represents the Canadian skies and white to represent snow, these colours were also used on his gravel and sand business&#x27; trucks. The colour blue was also a colour historically associated with the City of Toronto. The use of blue by top-level Toronto-based sports clubs began with the Argonaut Rowing Club in the 19th century, later adopted by their football team, the Toronto Argonauts, in 1873.

<text>Eric Ken Shinseki (; , born 28 November 1942) is a retired United States Army general who served as the seventh United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs (2009–2014) and the 34th Chief of Staff of the Army (1999–2003). Shinseki is a veteran of two tours of combat in the Vietnam War, in which he was awarded three Bronze Star Medals for valor and two Purple Hearts. He was the first Asian-American four-star general, and the first Asian-American Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

==Early life and education==

Shinseki was born in Lihue, Kauai, in the then Territory of Hawaii, to an American family of Japanese ancestry. His grandparents emigrated from Hiroshima to Hawaii in 1901. He grew up in a sugarcane plantation community on Kaua&#x27;i and graduated from Kaua&#x27;i High and Intermediate School in 1960. While attending Kaua&#x27;i he was active in the Boy Scouts and served as class president. As a boy, Shinseki learned that three of his uncles had served in the 442nd Infantry Regiment, a unit of Japanese Americans that became one of the most decorated fighting units in United States history. Motivated by his uncles&#x27; example, he attended the United States Military Academy and graduated in 1965 with a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission as a second lieutenant. He earned a Master of Arts degree in English Literature from Duke University in 1974. He was also educated at the Armor Officer Advanced Course, the United States Army Command and General Staff College, and the National War College of National Defense University.

==Military service==
Shinseki served in a variety of command and staff assignments in the Continental United States and overseas, including two combat tours with the 9th and 25th Infantry Divisions in the Republic of Vietnam as an artillery forward observer and as commander of Troop A, 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry Regiment during the Vietnam War. During one of those tours while serving as a forward artillery observer, he stepped on a land mine, which blew the front off one of his feet; after spending almost a year recovering from his injuries, he returned to active duty in 1971.

Shinseki has served at Schofield Barracks, Hawai&#x27;i, with Headquarters, United States Army Hawaii, and Fort Shafter with Headquarters, United States Army Pacific. He has taught at the U.S. Military Academy&#x27;s Department of English. During duty with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas, he served as the regimental adjutant and as the executive officer of its 1st Squadron.

Shinseki&#x27;s ten-plus years of service in Europe included assignments as Commander, 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, 3rd Infantry Division (Schweinfurt); Commander, 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division (Kitzingen); Assistant Chief of Staff, G3, 3rd Infantry Division (Operations, Plans and Training) (Würzburg); and Assistant Division Commander for Maneuver, 3rd Infantry Division (Schweinfurt). The 3rd Division was organized at that time as a heavy mechanized division. He also served as Assistant Chief of Staff, G3 (Operations, Plans, and Training), VII Corps (Stuttgart). Shinseki served as Deputy Chief of Staff for Support, Allied Land Forces Southern Europe (Verona), an element of the Allied Forces Southern Europe.

From March 1994 to July 1995, Shinseki commanded the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas. In July 1996, he was promoted to lieutenant general and became Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, United States Army. In June 1997, Shinseki was appointed to the rank of general before assuming duties as Commanding General, Seventh United States Army; Commander, Allied Land Forces Central Europe; and Commander, NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Shinseki became the Army&#x27;s 28th Vice Chief of Staff on 24 November 1998, then became its 34th Chief of Staff on 22 June 1999, the last Vietnam War veteran to hold the post. Shinseki retired on 11 June 2003, at the end of his four-year term. His Farewell Memo contained some of his ideas regarding the future of the military. At that time, General Shinseki retired from the Army after 38 years of military service.

, Shinseki was the highest-ranked Asian American military officer in the history of the United States. Additionally, as of 2004, he is the highest-ranked Japanese American to have served in the United States Armed Forces.

===Army Chief of Staff===

During his tenure as Army Chief of Staff, Shinseki initiated an innovative but controversial plan to make the army more strategically deployable and mobile in urban terrain by creating Stryker Interim-Force Brigade Combat Teams. He conceived a long-term strategic plan for the army dubbed &quot;Objective Force&quot;, which included a program he designed, Future Combat Systems. One other controversial plan that Shinseki implemented was the wearing of the black beret for all army personnel. Prior to Shinseki implementing this policy, only the United States Army Rangers could wear the black beret. When the black beret was given to all soldiers and officers, the Rangers moved to the tan beret.

Shinseki publicly clashed with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during the planning of the war in Iraq over how many troops the United States would need to keep in Iraq for the postwar occupation of that country. As Army Chief of Staff, Shinseki testified to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services on 25 February 2003, that &quot;something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers&quot; would probably be required for postwar Iraq. This was an estimate far higher than the figure being proposed by Secretary Rumsfeld in his invasion plan, and it was rejected in strong language by both Rumsfeld and his Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, who was another chief planner of the invasion and occupation. From then on, Shinseki&#x27;s influence on the Joint Chiefs of Staff reportedly waned. Critics of the Bush administration alleged that Shinseki was forced into early retirement as Army Chief of Staff because of his comments on troop levels; however, his retirement was announced nearly a year before those comments.

When the insurgency took hold in postwar Iraq, Shinseki&#x27;s comments and their public rejection by the civilian leadership were often cited by those who felt the Bush administration deployed too few troops to Iraq. On 15 November 2006, in testimony before Congress, CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid said that Shinseki had been correct that more troops were needed.

==Post-military career==

Shinseki has served as a director for several corporations: Honeywell International and Ducommun, military contractors; Grove Farm Corporation; First Hawaiian Bank; and Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. He is a member of the Advisory Boards at the Center for Public Leadership, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, and to the U.S. Comptroller General. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Atlantic Council of the United States, and the Association of the United States Army.

==United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs (2009–2014)==
On 7 December 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama announced at a press conference in Chicago that he would nominate Shinseki to become the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Shinseki was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on 20 January 2009, and sworn in the next day.

===Veterans Health Administration scandal===

In May 2014, Shinseki was embroiled in a scandal involving the Veterans Health Administration, which is a component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Questions involving substandard timely care and false records covering up related timelines had come to light, involving treatment of veterans in a number of veterans hospitals. On 30 May 2014, Obama announced that he had accepted Shinseki&#x27;s resignation as Secretary. Shinseki said he could not explain the lack of integrity among some leaders in veterans healthcare facilities: &quot;That breach of integrity is irresponsible, it is indefensible, and unacceptable to me&quot;. He said he could not defend what happened because it was indefensible, but he could take responsibility for it and he would. Shinseki&#x27;s resignation meant that 2014 was the first time since 2000 that there had not been an Asian American in the Cabinet of the United States.
In an interview with retired General Peter W. Chiarelli, journalist Robert Siegel described the situation as &quot;a case of a very, very good man who&#x27;s run up against some pretty terrible problems in his job&quot;, to which Chiarelli responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t look up to any man more than I look up to Eric Shinseki&quot;.

==Family==
Shinseki is married to his high school sweetheart, Patricia; they are the parents of two children, Lori and Ken. He also has seven grandchildren.

==Awards, decorations, and badges==
Shinseki was awarded the following medals, ribbons, badges, and tabs:

<text>The California Golden Seals were a professional ice hockey club that competed in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1967 to 1976. Based in Oakland, California, they played their home games at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena. The Seals were one of six teams added to the league as part of the 1967 NHL expansion. Initially named the California Seals, the team was renamed the Oakland Seals during the 1967–68 season and then the Bay Area Seals in 1970 before becoming the California Golden Seals the same year.

The Seals were the least successful of the teams added in the 1967 expansion, never earning a winning record and only making the playoffs twice in nine seasons of play. Off the ice, they were plagued by low attendance. The franchise was relocated in 1976 to become the Cleveland Barons, who would merge with the Minnesota North Stars two years later. They were the only franchise from the 1967 expansion to not reach the Stanley Cup Finals.

==History==

===Founding===
In 1966, the NHL announced that six expansion teams would be added as a new division for the 1967–68 season, officially because of a general desire to expand the league to new markets, but also to squelch the Western Hockey League&#x27;s threat to turn into a major league. The San Francisco Seals were one such team from the WHL. The NHL awarded an expansion team to Barry Van Gerbig for the San Francisco Bay Area. Van Gerbig decided to purchase the WHL club with the intent of bringing them into the NHL as an expansion team the following season.

Van Gerbig had planned to have the team play in a new arena in San Francisco, but the new arena was never built. He decided to move the team across the Bay from the Cow Palace in Daly City to Oakland to play in the new Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena. He renamed the club the California Seals. This was done in an attempt to appeal to fans from San Francisco, and to address complaints from the other NHL teams that Oakland was not considered a major league city and would not be a draw for fans.

A year later, Van Gerbig brought the Seals into the NHL as an expansion team. The team participated with the other five expansion teams in the 1967 NHL expansion draft; however, the terms imposed by the established Original Six teams were very one-sided in their favor. The existing NHL teams were permitted to protect nearly all of their best players, thus the players available for selection were mostly castoffs, aging players well past their prime and career minor leaguers. To bolster their roster and also to maintain a semblance of familiarity and continuity for existing Seals fans, the team retained a portion of the club&#x27;s WHL roster such as Charlie Burns, George Swarbrick, Gerry Odrowski, Tom Thurlby, and Ron Harris.

The Bay Area was not considered a particularly lucrative ice hockey market; however, the terms of a new television agreement with CBS called for two of the expansion teams to be located in California and other than the Los Angeles Kings there were no other prospective franchise applicants of similar pedigree to the Seals. Nevertheless, while the WHL Seals had drawn well at the Cow Palace the team drew poorly in Oakland once they entered the NHL. The plan to bring fans in from San Francisco failed, and on November 6, 1967, Van Gerbig announced that the team&#x27;s name would be changed to the Oakland Seals (although the league did not register the change until December 8 to focus more on the East Bay).

===Struggles===

The Seals were never successful at the gate even after the name change, and because of this poor attendance Van Gerbig threatened on numerous occasions to move the team elsewhere. First-year coach and general manager Bert Olmstead publicly advocated a move to Vancouver, resulting in an offer from Labatt&#x27;s brewery to purchase and relocate the team to the Canadian city as well as a proposal to move the team to Buffalo from the Knox brothers, who like Vancouver had been shut out of the 1967 expansion. The NHL, not wanting to endanger its TV deal with CBS, rejected both proposals. As a compromise, the NHL agreed to expand again in 1970, adding teams in both Vancouver and Buffalo. The Knoxes bought a minority share of the Seals in 1969, only to sell it a year later to fund the Sabres.

This, as well as the team&#x27;s mediocre on-ice performance, led to major changes to both the Seals&#x27; front office and the roster – only 7 of the 20 Seals players remained after the first season. The new-look Seals were somewhat more successful. In their second season they improved to 69 points, which while still seven games below .500 was good enough for second place in the all-expansion West Division. The Seals were actually favored to win their first round playoff matchup against the Kings, but were upset in seven games. Oakland regressed to 58 points the following season, but still edged out the Philadelphia Flyers for the final playoff spot on a tiebreaker. Their second playoff appearance was a brief one as they were swept by the Pittsburgh Penguins. Those were the only two years that the franchise made the playoffs.

The league&#x27;s rejection of a proposed move to Vancouver prompted a lawsuit that was not settled until 1974 (&quot;San Francisco Seals Ltd. v. National Hockey League&quot;). The Seals organization filed suit against the NHL claiming that the prohibition violated the Sherman Act. The Seals asserted that the league&#x27;s constitution was in violation by prohibiting clubs from relocating their operations, and that the relocation request was denied in an attempt to keep the San Francisco market in the NHL and thereby discourage the formation of a rival team or league in that location. The court ruled that the NHL was a single entity, and that the teams were not competitors in an economic sense, so the league restrictions on relocation were not a restraint of trade.

For the 1969–70 season the team was sold to Trans-National Communications, whose investors included Pat Summerall and Whitey Ford. However, the group filed for bankruptcy after missing a payment and relinquished the team to Van Gerbig, who put the team back on the market.

===Charles O. Finley purchases the franchise===

Prior to the 1970–71 season, Charles O. Finley, the flamboyant and eccentric owner of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Oakland Athletics, purchased the Seals. Finley and roller derby boss Jerry Seltzer had both put in bids on the team. Although Seltzer&#x27;s offer was slightly better financed and included a more detailed plan for revival, a majority of NHL owners from the &quot;old establishment&quot; voted in favor of Finley. General manager Bill Torrey left by mid-season due to clashes with Finley.

Finley renamed the team the &quot;Bay Area Seals&quot; to begin the 1970–71 season. However, on October 16, 1970, just two games into the season, he changed the team name to the &quot;California Golden Seals&quot;, following a number of other marketing gimmicks intended to promote the team to the fans, among them changing the Seals&#x27; colors to green and gold to match those of the popular Athletics. The team&#x27;s uniform crest was now the word &quot;Seals&quot; in a unique typeface, but an alternate logo using a sketch based on a photo of star player Carol Vadnais was used on marketing materials such as pennants, stickers and team programs. The original 1967 California Seals logo recolored in green and gold was often seen on trading cards and other unofficial material, but was never adopted by the team. The Seals are remembered for wearing white skates, but initially Torrey convinced Finley to use green and gold painted skates instead, as team-colored skates were a trend of the period. However, this was all for naught, as the Seals finished with the worst record in the NHL that year. Other innovations that Finley&#x27;s Seals incorporated, were the inclusion of player names on the back of the jerseys, which then set the precedent for NHL teams identifying players in the same fashion. Finley also was the first owner to allow players to fly first class on commercial flights to games, thus starting a trend that ultimately culminated in NHL teams regularly chartering aircraft by the 21st century. The Seals regularly used the new Boeing 747 planes the airlines had put into service at the time. Finley also introduced the flamboyant green and gold &quot;Seals luggage&quot; which all players and coaches were required to carry, to identify them as the northern California NHL team. On May 22, 1970, the Seals traded their 1971 first-round pick to the Montreal Canadiens along with Francois Lacombe in return for Montreal&#x27;s 1970 first-round pick (Seals selected Chris Oddleifson), Ernie Hicke, and cash. As a result of the Seals&#x27; dreadful 1970–71 season, the Canadiens had the top pick in the 1971 draft, and used it to select future Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur. This transaction was later called as one of the most one-sided deals in NHL history.

===Under the ownership of the NHL and Mel Swig===
The team rebounded in 1971–72, but the arrival of the World Hockey Association (WHA) wiped out most of those gains. Finley refused to match the WHA&#x27;s contract offers, causing five of the team&#x27;s top 10 scorers from the previous season to bolt to the new league. Devoid of any defensive talent save for goaltender Gilles Meloche, the Seals sank into last place again in 1972–73, where they would remain for the rest of their history. Although divisional restructuring in 1974–75 included a revamped format in which three teams in each division made the playoffs, the team&#x27;s efforts were frustrated by their placement in the Adams Division, with the strong Sabres, Boston Bruins, and Toronto Maple Leafs. The Seals once again finished well out of playoff contention, and were notably the only team to lose at home to the expansion Washington Capitals.

Finley soon lost patience with his struggling team, especially given the contrast to his World Series champion Athletics. He tried to sell the Seals, but when no credible buyers came forward who were interested in keeping the team in the Bay Area, he sold the team back to the league for $6.585 million. A 1973 attempt by Finley to sell the team to Indianapolis interests who planned to relocate the team to that city was rejected by the NHL&#x27;s Board of Governors.

In early 1975, newspapers reported that the Seals and Pittsburgh Penguins were to be relocated to Denver and Seattle, respectively, in an arrangement that would have seen the two teams sold to groups in those cities that had already been awarded &quot;conditional&quot; franchises for the 1976–77 season. At the same time, the league announced that if the Seals&#x27; sale to the Denver group was not completed or new ownership found locally, the franchise would be liquidated at the end of the season.

The Denver arrangement fell through, and the league ran the Seals for more than a year until a group headed by San Francisco hotel magnate Melvin Swig bought the team on July 28, 1975, with the intention of moving the team to a proposed new arena in San Francisco. The team fell just short of the playoffs, and after a mayoral election, plans for the new arena were canceled. With a new arena out of the picture, the league dropped their objection to the relocation of the franchise.

===The end===

Although attendance was finally showing some improvement and the team playing better, minority owners George and Gordon Gund persuaded Swig to seek approval to move the team to their hometown of Cleveland. The team&#x27;s final game in Oakland was a win over the Los Angeles Kings on April 4, 1976; league approval for the move was granted on July 14, and the team was renamed the Cleveland Barons after the city&#x27;s former team in the American Hockey League (AHL).

Unfortunately, details were not finalized until less than six weeks before the start of the 1976–77 season, rendering the Barons all but invisible in Cleveland. After two more years of losses and with attendance worse than it had been in Oakland, the Gunds (by this time majority owners) were permitted to merge the Barons with the equally strapped Minnesota North Stars on June 14, 1978. The merged team continued as the Minnesota North Stars under the Gunds&#x27; ownership, but assumed the Barons&#x27; place in the Adams Division. The North Stars ultimately relocated to Dallas following the 1992–93 season to become the Dallas Stars.

The Cleveland Barons remain the most recent team in an established North American major professional leagues to fold. They were also the last actively playing NHL team to do so since the Brooklyn Americans in 1942 (the franchise was formally cancelled in 1946) and the last team to cease operations since the Montreal Maroons had their franchise formally canceled in 1947 (though they had not iced a team since 1938). As a result, the NHL consisted of 17 teams for the 1978–79 season.

===Legacy===
The current NHL team in the Bay Area, the San Jose Sharks, has a historical connection to the Seals. Years after the Barons–North Stars merger, the Gunds wanted to bring ice hockey back to the Bay Area. They asked the NHL for permission to move the North Stars there in the late 1980s, but the league was unwilling to abandon a traditional ice hockey market like the Twin Cities. Meanwhile, a group led by former Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin was pushing the NHL to bring a team to San Jose, where an arena was being built. Eventually, a compromise was struck whereby the Gunds would sell their share of the North Stars to Baldwin&#x27;s group, with the Gunds receiving an expansion team in the Bay Area to begin play in the 1991–92 season. In return, the Sharks would have the rights to players from the North Stars and then participate with the North Stars as an equal partner in an expansion draft with the new franchise. On May 5, 1990, the Gunds officially sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin and were awarded a new team in the Bay Area that became the Sharks. Coincidentally, in their first two seasons in the league, the Sharks played their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the same facility the NHL rejected as a home for the Seals in 1967), while their new permanent home arena in San Jose was being completed.

Dennis Maruk was the last Seals player active in the NHL, retiring as a member of the North Stars in 1989. The last former Seals player in any league was George Pesut, who was active in Germany until 1994.

Though no longer an active team, the Seals remained a popular subject, and are the subject of multiple works. In 2006, Brad Kurtzberg published the first book on the Seals franchise, &quot;Shorthanded: The Untold Story of the Seals: Hockey&#x27;s Most Colorful Team&quot;. In January 2017, filmmaker Mark Greczmiel released his documentary, &quot;The California Golden Seals Story&quot; on iTunes. In 2016, the Seals tribute website was launched to help promote the November 2017 release of the book, &quot;The California Golden Seals: A Tale of White Skates, Red Ink, and One of the NHL&#x27;s Most Outlandish Teams&quot;, which covered the Seals&#x27; and Barons&#x27; entire history, including their six years in the WHL.

The San Jose Sharks unveiled their Reverse Retro jersey based on the final years of the Golden Seals on October 20, 2022.
