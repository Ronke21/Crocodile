<text>Pierre Jean Marie Laval (; 28 June 1883 – 15 October 1945) was a French politician. He served as Prime Minister of France three times: 1931–1932 and 1935–1936 during the Third Republic, and 1942–1944 during the Vichy France. After the war, Laval was tried as a collaborator and executed for treason.

A socialist early in his life, Laval became a lawyer in 1909 and was famous for his defence of strikers, trade unionists and leftists from government prosecution. In 1914, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), and he remained committed to his pacifist convictions during the First World War. After his defeat in the 1919 election, Laval left the SFIO and became mayor of Aubervilliers. In 1924 he returned to the Chamber as an independent, and was elected to the Senate three years later. He also held a series of governmental positions, including Minister of Public Works, Minister of Justice and Minister of Labour. In 1931, Laval became prime minister, but his government fell only a year later.

Laval joined the conservative government of Gaston Doumergue in 1934 and served as Minister of the Colonies and then Foreign Minister. In 1935, Laval again became prime minister. Seeking to contain Germany, he pursued foreign policies favourable to Italy and the Soviet Union, but his handling of the Abyssinia Crisis, which was widely denounced as appeasement of Benito Mussolini, prompted his resignation in 1936.

After France&#x27;s defeat by the blitzkrieg invasion of Nazi Germany, Laval, by this time a well-known Fascist sympathizer, served in prominent roles in Philippe Pétain&#x27;s Vichy France, first as the vice-president of the Council of Ministers from July 1940 to December 1940 and later as the head of government from April 1942 to August 1944. During this time he displayed harsh treatment towards the people of France, sending thousands of French people, including Jews, to slavery in Germany-occupied Poland and Germany, and often relied on heavy handed tactics to keep the populace in line, which only fueled opposition to the already unpopular government.

After the Liberation of France in 1944, Laval was imprisoned by the Germans. In April 1945, he fled to Spain but soon returned to France, where he was arrested by the French government under Charles de Gaulle. After what has been described as a flawed trial, much like those many under the Vichy regime underwent, Laval was found guilty of plotting against the security of the state and of collaboration with the enemy. After a thwarted suicide attempt, Laval was executed by firing squad in October 1945. There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat.

==Early life==
Pierre Jean Marie Laval was born on 28 June 1883 in Châteldon, near Vichy in the northern part of Auvergne, the son of Gilbert Laval and Claudine Tournaire. According to some news outlets he possibly had some Moorish ancestry. His father worked as a café proprietor and postman. The family was comfortably off compared to the rest of the village: the café also served as a hostel and a butcher&#x27;s shop, and Gilbert Laval owned a vineyard and horses. The last name &quot;Laval&quot; was widespread in the region at that time. The family branch was commonly named Laval-Tournaire, and his father had himself called &quot;Baptiste Moulin&quot;.

Laval was educated at the village school in Châteldon. At age 15, he was sent to the lycée Saint-Louis in Paris where he obtained his &quot;baccalauréat&quot; in July 1901. He then continued his studies in Southwestern France, in Bordeaux and Bayonne, where he learnt Spanish and met Pierre Cathala. Returning to Lyon, he spent the next year reading for a degree in zoology and served as a supervisor in various &quot;collèges&quot; and &quot;lycées&quot; of Lyon, Saint-Étienne and Autun to pay for his studies.

Laval joined the socialist Central Revolutionary Committee in 1903, while he was living in Saint-Étienne, 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Lyon. During this period, Laval became familiar with the left-wing doctrines of Georges Sorel and Hubert Lagardelle. &quot;I was never a very orthodox socialist&quot;, he declared more than forty years later in 1945, &quot;by which I mean that I was never much of a Marxist. My socialism was much more a socialism of the heart than a doctrinal socialism ... I was much more interested in men, their jobs, their misfortunes and their conflicts than in the digressions of the great German pontiff.&quot;

In 1903, he was called up for military service and, after serving in the ranks, was discharged for varicose veins. Laval returned to Paris in 1907 at the age of 24. In April 1913 he said that &quot;barrack-based armies [were] incapable of the slightest effort, because they are badly-trained and, above all, badly commanded.&quot; Laval favoured abolition of the army and replacement by a citizens&#x27; militia.

==Lawyer==

Abandoning natural science studies, Laval eventually turned to law and became in 1909 a &quot;lawyer of the poor people&quot;, who was near syndicalists of the CGT. The years before the First World War were characterised by labour unrest, and Laval defended strikers, trade unionists and left-wing agitators against government attempts to prosecute them. At a trade union conference, Laval said:
The first case that led him to fame was the acquittal of Gustave Manhès, a revolutionary trade unionist who had been charged with possession of explosives and anarchist manuals.

Laval married Jeanne Claussat in 1909, the daughter of the Socialist politician Dr Joseph Claussat. Their only child, a daughter named Josée, was born in 1911. Josée married René de Chambrun, whose uncle, Nicholas Longworth III, married Alice Roosevelt, the daughter of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Although Laval&#x27;s wife came from a political family, she never participated in politics. Laval was generally considered to be devoted to his family.

In 1911, he stood for the National Assembly in the Neuilly-Boulogne electoral district and caused the conservative candidate Édouard Nortier to win since Laval stood in the second round despite the Radical candidate, Alexandre Percin, doing so as well.

==First World War==
===Socialist deputy for Seine===
In April 1914, as fear of war swept the nation, the Socialists and Radicals geared up their electoral campaign in defence of peace. Their leaders were Jean Jaurès and Joseph Caillaux. The Bloc des Gauches (&quot;Lefts Bloc&quot;) denounced the law passed in July 1913 that extended compulsory military service from two to three years.

In the 1914 legislative election, held three months before the outbreak of World War I, the trade unions sought Laval as the Socialist candidate for the Seine, the district comprising Paris and its suburbs. Laval was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the second electoral district of Saint-Denis. At nearly 31, he was the youngest member of the Chamber.

The Radicals, with the support of Socialists, held the majority in the French Chamber of Deputies. Together, they hoped to avert war, but the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914 and of Jaurès on 31 July 1914 shattered those hopes. Laval&#x27;s brother, Jean, died in the first months of the war.

Laval was listed in the &quot;Carnet B&quot;, a compilation of potentially subversive elements that might hinder mobilisation. In the name of national unity, Minister of the Interior Jean-Louis Malvy, despite pressure from chiefs of staff, refused to have anyone apprehended. Laval remained true to his pacifist convictions during the war. In December 1915, Jean Longuet, the grandson of Karl Marx, proposed to Socialist parliamentarians that they communicate with socialists of other states in the hope of pressing governments into a negotiated peace. Laval signed on, but the motion was defeated.

With France&#x27;s resources geared for war, goods were scarce or overpriced. On 30 January 1917, in the National Assembly Laval called upon Supply Minister Édouard Herriot to deal with the inadequate coal supply in Paris. When Herriot said, &quot;If I could, I would unload the barges myself&quot;, Laval retorted, &quot;Do not add ridicule to ineptitude&quot;. Those words delighted the Assembly and attracted the attention of Georges Clemenceau but left the relationship between Laval and Herriot permanently strained.

===Stockholm, &quot;polar star&quot;===
Laval scorned the conduct of the war and the poor supply of troops in the field. When mutinies broke out after General Robert Nivelle&#x27;s offensive of April 1917 at Chemin des Dames, he spoke in defence of the mutineers. When Marcel Cachin and Marius Moutet returned from St. Petersburg in June 1917 with the invitation to a socialist convention in Stockholm, Laval saw a chance for peace. In an address to the Assembly, he urged the chamber to allow a delegation to go: &quot;Yes, Stockholm, in response to the call of the Russian Revolution... Yes, Stockholm, for peace... Yes, Stockholm the polar star.&quot; The request was denied.

The hope of peace in spring 1917 was overwhelmed by discovery of traitors, some real and some imagined, as with Malvy, who became a suspect because he had refused to arrest Frenchmen on the &quot;Carnet B&quot;. Laval&#x27;s &quot;Stockholm, étoile polaire&quot; speech had not been forgotten. Many of Laval&#x27;s acquaintances, the publishers of the anarchist &quot;Bonnet rouge&quot; and other pacifists were arrested or interrogated. Though Laval frequented pacifist circles (it was said that he was acquainted with Leon Trotsky), the authorities did not pursue him. His status as a deputy, his caution and his friendships protected him. In November 1917, Clemenceau became prime minister and offered Laval a post in his government. Laval refused, as the Socialist Party refused to enter any government, but he questioned the wisdom of such a policy in a meeting of Socialist deputies.

==Initial postwar career==
===From Socialist to Independent===
In the 1919 elections the Socialists&#x27; record of pacifism, their opposition to Clemenceau and anxiety arising from the excesses of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia contributed to their defeat by the conservative National Bloc. Laval lost his seat in the Chamber of Deputies.

The General Confederation of Labour (Confédération Générale du Travail - CGT), with 2,400,000 members, launched a general strike in 1920, which petered out with thousands of workers being laid off. In response, the government sought to dissolve the CGT. Laval, with Joseph Paul-Boncour as chief counsel, defended the union&#x27;s leaders and saved the union by appealing to Interior Minister Théodore Steeg and Commerce and Industry Minister Auguste Isaac.

Laval&#x27;s relations with the Socialist Party drew to an end. The last years with the Socialist caucus, combined with the party&#x27;s disciplinary policies, eroded Laval&#x27;s attachment to the cause. With the Bolshevik victory in Russia, the party was changing. At the Congress of Tours in December 1920, the Socialists split into two ideological components: the French Communist Party (SFIC, later PC-SFIC), which was inspired by Moscow, and the more moderate French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO). Laval let his membership lapse and did not take sides as both factions battled over the legacy of Jean Jaurès.

===Mayor of Aubervilliers===
In 1923, Aubervilliers, north of Paris, needed a mayor. As a former deputy of the constituency, Laval was an obvious candidate. To be eligible for election, Laval bought farmland, Les Bergeries. Few were aware of his defection from the Socialists. Laval was also asked by the local SFIO and Communists to head their lists. Laval chose to run under his own list of former Socialists whom he had convinced to leave the party and to work for him. The independent Socialist Party of sorts existed only in Aubervilliers. In a four-way race, Laval won in the second round. He served as mayor of Aubervilliers until just before his death.

Laval was seen as &quot;&quot;; a joke stated that he was so clever that he was born with a name that is spelled the same from left or from right. Laval won over those whom he had defeated by cultivating personal contacts. He developed a network among the humble and the well-to-do in Aubervilliers and with mayors of neighbouring towns. He was the only independent politician in the suburb and avoided entering the ideological war between socialists and communists.

===Independent Deputy for Seine===
In the 1924 legislative elections, the SFIO and the Radicals formed a national coalition, known as the Cartel des Gauches. Laval headed a list of independent socialists in the Seine. The Cartel won, and Laval regained a seat in the National Assembly. His first act was to bring back Joseph Caillaux, a former prime minister, Cabinet member and member of the National Assembly who had once been the star of the Radical Party. Clemenceau had had Caillaux arrested toward the end of the war for collusion with the enemy. Caillaux spent two years in prison and lost his civic rights. Laval successfully fought for Caillaux&#x27;s pardon, and Caillaux became an influential patron.

==Member of government==
===Minister and senator===
Laval&#x27;s reward for support of the Cartel was appointment as Minister of Public Works in the government of Paul Painlevé in April 1925, but six months later, the government collapsed. Laval from then on belonged to the club of former ministers from which new ministers were drawn. Between 1925 and 1926, Laval participated three more times in governments of Aristide Briand, once as under-secretary to the Prime Minister and twice as Minister of Justice (&quot;garde des sceaux&quot;). When he first became Minister of Justice, Laval abandoned his law practice to avoid a conflict of interest.

Laval&#x27;s momentum was frozen after 1926 by a reshuffling of the Cartel majority orchestrated by the Radical-Socialist mayor and deputy of Lyon, Édouard Herriot. Founded in 1901, the Radical Party became the hinge faction of the Third Republic, and its support or defection often meant the survival or the collapse of governments. Through that latest swing, Laval was excluded from the government of France for four years. Author Gaston Jacquemin suggested that Laval chose not to partake in a Herriot government, which he judged to be incapable of handling the financial crisis. Although 1926 marked the definitive break between Laval and the left, he maintained friends on the left.

In 1927, Laval was elected Senator for the Seine, which withdrew him from and placed himself above the political battles for majorities in the Chamber of Deputies. He longed for a constitutional reform to strengthen the executive branch and to eliminate political instability, a major flaw of the Third Republic.

On 2 March 1930, Laval returned as Minister of Labour in the second André Tardieu government. Tardieu and Laval knew each other from the days of Clemenceau and had come to appreciate each other&#x27;s qualities. Tardieu needed men he could trust since his previous government had collapsed a little over a week earlier because of the defection of Labour Minister Louis Loucheur. However, when the Radical Socialist Camille Chautemps failed to form a viable government, Tardieu was called back.

===Personal investments===
From 1927 to 1930, Laval began to accumulate a sizeable personal fortune. After the war, his wealth resulted in charges that he had used his political position to line his own pockets. &quot;I have always thought&quot;, he wrote to the examining magistrate on 11 September 1945, &quot;that a soundly based material independence, if not indispensable, gives those statesmen who possess it a much greater political independence&quot;. Until 1927, his principal source of income had been his fees as a lawyer and in that year, they totalled 113,350 francs, according to his income tax returns. Between August 1927 and June 1930, he undertook large-scale investments in various enterprises that totalled 51 million francs. Not all of that money was his own, but some came from a group of financiers that had the backing of an investment trust, the Union Syndicale et Financière, as well as two banks, the Comptoir Lyon Allemand and the Banque Nationale de Crédit.

Two of the investments that Laval and his backers acquired were provincial newspapers, &quot;Le Moniteur du Puy-de-Dôme&quot; and its associated printing works at Clermont-Ferrand, and the Lyon &quot;Républicain&quot;. The circulation of the &quot;Moniteur&quot; had stood at 27,000 in 1926 before Laval took it over. By 1933, it had more than doubled, peaking at 58,250 but declining thereafter. Profits varied, but during the 17 years of his control, Laval earned some 39 million francs in income from the paper and the printing works combined. The renewed plant was valued at 50 million francs, which led the High Court expert in 1945 to say with some justification that it had been &quot;an excellent deal for him&quot;.

===Minister of Labour and Social Insurance===
More than 150,000 textile workers were on strike, and violence was feared. As Minister of Public Works in 1925, Laval had ended the strike of mine workers. Tardieu hoped he could do the same as Minister of Labour. The conflict was settled without bloodshed. The Socialist politician Léon Blum, never one of Laval&#x27;s allies, conceded that Laval&#x27;s &quot;intervention was skilful, opportune and decisive&quot;.

Social insurance had been on the agenda for ten years. It had passed the Chamber of Deputies but not the Senate, in 1928. Tardieu gave Laval until May Day to get the project through. The date was chosen to stifle the agitation of Labour Day. Laval&#x27;s first effort went into clarifying the muddled collection of texts. He then consulted employer and labour organisations. Laval had to reconcile the divergent views of Chamber and Senate. &quot;Had it not been for Laval&#x27;s unwearying patience&quot;, Laval&#x27;s associate Tissier wrote, &quot;an agreement would never have been achieved&quot;.
In two months, Laval presented the Assembly a text that overcame its original failure. It met the financial constraints, reduced the control of the government and preserved the choice of doctors and their billing freedom. The Chamber and the Senate passed the law with an overwhelming majority.

When the bill had passed its final stages, Tardieu described his Minister of Labour as &quot;displaying at every moment of the discussion as much tenacity as restraint and ingenuity&quot;.

==First Laval government==
Tardieu&#x27;s government ultimately proved unable to weather the Oustric Affair. After the failure of the Oustric Bank, it appeared that members of the government had improper ties to it. The scandal involved Justice Minister Raoul Péret and Under-Secretaries Henri Falcoz and Eugène Lautier. Tardieu had not been involved, but on 4 December 1930, he lost his majority in the Senate. President Gaston Doumergue called on Louis Barthou to form a government, but Barthou failed to do so. Doumergue turned to Laval, who fared no better. The following month, the government that was formed by Théodore Steeg floundered.

Doumergue renewed his offer to Laval. On 27 January 1931, Laval successfully formed his first government.

In the words of its leader, Léon Blum, the Socialist opposition was amazed and disappointed that the ghost of Tardieu&#x27;s government had reappeared within a few weeks of being defeated with Laval at its head &quot;like a night bird surprised by the light&quot;. Laval&#x27;s nomination as prime minister led to speculation that Tardieu, the new agriculture minister, held the real power in the government.

Although Laval thought highly of Tardieu and Briand and applied policies in line with theirs, however, Laval was not Tardieu&#x27;s mouthpiece. Ministers who formed the Laval government were in great part those who had formed Tardieu&#x27;s governments but that was a function of the composite majority thaf Laval could find at the National Assembly. Raymond Poincaré, Aristide Briand and Tardieu had offered ministerial posts to Herriot&#x27;s Radicals but to no avail.

Besides Briand, André Maginot, Pierre-Étienne Flandin and Paul Reynaud, Laval brought in as his advisors, friends such as Maurice Foulon from Aubervilliers and Pierre Cathala. Laval had known Cathala in Bayonne, and Cathala had worked in Laval&#x27;s Labour Ministry. Cathala began as Under-Secretary of the Interior and was appointed as Minister of the Interior in January 1932. Blaise Diagne of Senegal, the first African deputy, had been elected to the National Assembly at the same time as Laval in 1914. Laval invited Diagne to join his cabinet as Under-Secretary to the Colonies. Diagne was the first Black African appointed to a cabinet position in a French government. Laval also called on financial experts such as Jacques Rueff, Charles Rist and Adéodat Boissard. André François-Poncet was appointed as Laval&#x27;s Under-Secretary and then as ambassador to Germany. Laval&#x27;s government included an economist, Claude-Joseph Gignoux, when economists in government service were still rare.

France in 1931 was mostly unaffected by the world economic crisis. Laval declared on embarking for the United States on 16 October 1931, &quot;France remained healthy thanks to work and savings&quot;. Agriculture, small industry, and protectionism were the bases of France&#x27;s economy. With a conservative policy of contained wages and limited social services — and with its colonies — France had accumulated the largest gold reserves in the world after the United States. France reaped the benefit of devaluation of the franc that had been orchestrated by Poincaré, which made French products competitive on the world market. In all of France, only 12,000 people were recorded as unemployed.

Laval and his cabinet considered the economy and gold reserves as means to diplomatic ends. Laval left to visit London; Berlin; and Washington, DC. He attended conferences on the world crisis, war reparations and debt, disarmament and the gold standard.

===Role in 1931 Austrian financial crisis===
In 1931, Austria underwent a banking crisis when its largest bank, the Creditanstalt, was revealed to be nearly bankrupt. That threatened a worldwide financial crisis, and world leaders began negotiating the terms for an international loan to Austria&#x27;s central government to sustain its financial system. However, Laval blocked the proposed package for nationalist reasons and demanded for France to receive a series of diplomatic concessions in exchange for its support, including renunciation of a prospective German-Austrian customs union. That proved to be fatal for the negotiations, which ultimately fell through. As a result, the Creditanstalt declared bankruptcy on 11 May 1931 and precipitated a crisis that quickly spread to other nations. Within four days, bank runs in Budapest, Hungary, were underway, and bank failures began spreading to Germany, Britain and elsewhere.

===Hoover Moratorium===
The Hoover Moratorium on 20 June 1931, a proposal made by US President Herbert Hoover to freeze all intergovernmental debt repayments for a one-year period, was according to the author and political advisor McGeorge Bundy &quot;the most significant action taken by an American president for Europe since Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s administration.&quot; The United States had enormous stakes in Germany since long-term German borrowers owed the US private sector more than $1.25 billion, and the short-term debt neared $1 billion. By comparison, the entire US national income in 1931 was only $54 billion. To put that into perspective, the authors Walter Lippmann and William O. Scroggs stated in &quot;The United States in World Affairs, an Account of American Foreign Relations&quot;, that &quot;the American stake in Germany&#x27;s government and private obligations was equal to half that of all the rest of the world combined&quot;.

The proposed moratorium would also benefit Britain&#x27;s investment in Germany&#x27;s private sector by making more likely that those loans would be repaid while the public indebtedness was frozen. It was in Hoover&#x27;s interest to offer aid to an ailing British economy in the light of the British debt to the United States. France, on the other hand, had a relatively small stake in Germany&#x27;s private debt but a huge interest in German reparations, and payments to France would be compromised under the Hoover Moratorium.

The scheme was further complicated by ill timing; the perception of collusion by the Americans, British and Germans; and its breaching of the Young Plan. Such breach could be approved in France only by the National Assembly, and the survival of Laval&#x27;s government rested on the legislature&#x27;s approval of the moratorium. Seventeen days elapsed between the proposal and the vote of confidence in the legislature. That delay was blamed for the lack of success of the Hoover Moratorium although the US Congress did not approve it until December 1931.

In support of the Hoover Moratorium, Laval undertook a year of personal and direct diplomacy by which he traveled to London, Berlin and Washington. There were considerable domestic achievements to his name, but his international efforts were short on results. British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson were preoccupied by internal political divisions and the collapse of the pound sterling and so were unable to help. German Chancellor Heinrich Brüning and Foreign Minister Julius Curtius were eager for Franco-German reconciliation but were under siege on all sides. They faced a very weak economy, which made meeting the government payroll a weekly miracle. Private bankruptcies and constant layoffs had the Communists on a short fuse. At the other end of the political spectrum, the German Army spied on the Brüning cabinet and fed information to &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and the Nazis, which effectively froze any overtures towards France.

In the United States, the conference between Hoover and Laval was an exercise in mutual frustration. Hoover&#x27;s plan for a reduced military had been rebuffed, albeit gently. A solution to the Danzig Corridor problem had been retracted. The concept of introducing a silver standard for countries that left the gold standard was viewed by Laval and François Albert-Buisson as a frivolous proposal. Hoover thought that it might have helped &quot;Mexico, India, China and South America&quot;, but Laval dismissed the silver solution as an inflationary proposition and added that &quot;it was cheaper to inflate paper.&quot;

Laval did not get a security pact without which the French would never consider disarmament, and he did not obtain an endorsement for the political moratorium. The promise to match any reduction of German reparations with a decrease of the French debt was not put in the communiqué. The joint statement declared the attachment of France and the United States to the gold standard.

Both governments also agreed that the Banque de France and the Federal Reserve would consult each other before transfers of gold. That was welcome news after the run on American gold in the preceding weeks. In light of the financial crisis, the leaders agreed to review the economic situation in Germany before the Hoover Moratorium had run its course.

There were meagre political results. The Hoover–Laval encounter, however, had other effects by making Laval more widely known and raising his standing in the United States and France. The American and French press were smitten. His optimism was such a contrast to his grim-sounding international contemporaries that in &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him as the 1931 Man of the Year, an honour that had never bestowed before on a Frenchman. Laval followed Mohandas K. Gandhi and preceded Franklin D. Roosevelt in receiving the honour.

==Pre-war==
The second Cartel des Gauches resigned after the 6 February 1934 crisis had involved anti-parliamentarist groups of far-right leagues, veterans organizations and the French Communist Party(PCF). Laval and Marshal Philippe Pétain had contacts with some conservative politicians among the groups involved. Laval became Minister of Colonies in the new conservative government of Gaston Doumergue. In October, Foreign Minister Louis Barthou was assassinated. Laval succeeded him and held that office until 1936.

Laval was then opposed to Germany, the &quot;hereditary enemy&quot; of France, and pursued anti-German alliances. He met with Mussolini in Rome, and both signed the Franco-Italian Agreement on 4 January 1935. It ceded parts of French Somaliland to Italy and allowed it a free hand in Abyssinia in exchange for support against any German aggression. Laval denied that he had given Mussolini a free hand in Abyssinia and even wrote to &quot;Il Duce&quot; on the subject. Also in January, Laval became the first member of a French Government to visit the Vatican since Napoleon; he was enthusiastically received by Pope Pius XI, and awarded with the Grand Cross of the Order of Pius IX. In April 1935, Laval persuaded Italy and Britain to join France in the Stresa Front against German ambitions in Austria. On 2 May 1935, he signed the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance, and he met with Josef Stalin, Premier Vyacheslaff Molotoff and Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinoff in Moscow about 13 May 1935 to seal the alliance. 

Laval&#x27;s primary aim before the Italo-Abyssinian War was to retain Italy as an anti-German power and to avoid driving it into Germany&#x27;s hands by adopting a hostile attitude to an invasion of Abyssinia. According to the British historian Correlli Barnett, in Laval&#x27;s view, &quot;all that really mattered was Nazi Germany. His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland; his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees. To estrange Italy, one of the Locarno powers, over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Laval&#x27;s Auvergnat peasant mind&quot;.

In June 1935, Laval became prime minister as well. In October 1935, Laval and British Foreign Minister Samuel Hoare proposed a &quot;realpolitik&quot; solution to the Abyssinia Crisis. After its leak to the media in December, the Hoare–Laval Pact was widely denounced as appeasement of Mussolini. Laval was forced to resign on 22 January 1936, and was driven completely out of ministerial politics. The victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 French legislative election meant that Laval was out of power, but he had a left-wing government to target in his media.

==Vichy France==
===Formation of government===
During the Phoney War, Laval was cautiously ambivalent towards the conflict. He was on record as saying in March 1940 that although the war could have been avoided by diplomatic means, it was now up to the government to prosecute it with the utmost vigour.

On 9 June 1940, the Germans were advancing on a front of more than long across the entire width of France. As far as General Maxime Weygand was concerned, &quot;if the Germans crossed the Seine and the Marne, it was the end&quot;. Simultaneously, Marshal Philippe Pétain was increasing the pressure upon Prime Minister Paul Reynaud to call for an armistice. Meanwhile, Laval was in Châteldon. On 10 June, in view of the German advance, the government left Paris for Tours. Weygand had informed Reynaud that &quot;the final rupture of our lines may take place at any time&quot;. Then, &quot;our forces would continue to fight until their strength and resources were extinguished. But their disintegration would be no more than a matter of time&quot;. Weygand had avoided using the word &quot;armistice&quot;, but it was on the minds of all of those who were involved and was opposed to by Reynaud.

Laval had meanwhile left Châteldon for Bordeaux, where his daughter nearly convinced him of the necessity of going to the United States. Instead, it was reported that he was sending &quot;messengers and messengers&quot; to Pétain.

As the Germans occupied Paris, Pétain was asked to form a new government. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, he produced a list of his ministers, which was convincing proof that he had been expecting and had been prepared for the President&#x27;s summons. When he was informed that he was to be appointed Minister of Justice, Laval&#x27;s temper and ambitions became apparent as he ferociously demanded of Pétain, despite the objections of other men of government, to make him Minister of Foreign Affairs. Laval realised that only through that position could he effect a reversal of alliances and bring himself to favour with Nazi Germany, the military power that he viewed as the inevitable victor. However, Permanent Under-Secretary François Charles-Roux refused to serve under Laval. One consequence of those events was that Laval was later able to claim that he had not been part of the government that requested the armistice. His name did not appear in the chronicles of events until June, when he began to assume a more active role in criticising the government&#x27;s decision to leave France for North Africa.
Although the final terms of the armistice were harsh, the French colonial empire was left untouched, the French Navy was maintained, and the French government was nominally allowed to administer the occupied and unoccupied zones if it obeyed German directives. The concept of &quot;collaboration&quot; had been written into the Armistice Convention before Laval joined the government. The French representatives who affixed their signatures to the text accepted the term:

===In Vichy government, 1940===

By then, there was very little left of Laval the socialist. He now openly sympathized with National Socialism and was convinced that Germany would win the war. For that reason, Laval felt France needed to emulate the Third Reich and its totalitarian regime as much as possible. To that end, when he was included in the Cabinet as minister of state, Laval set about with the work for which he is remembered: dismantling the Third Republic and its democracy and taking up the fascist cause.

In October 1940, Laval understood collaboration more or less in the same sense as Pétain. For both, that meant giving up the least possible to get the most in return. Laval, in his role of go-between, was forced to be in constant touch with the German authorities, to shift ground, to be wily and to plan ahead. All of that under the circumstances drew more attention to him than to the Marshal and made him appear to many Frenchmen as &quot;the agent of collaboration&quot;, and to others, he was &quot;the Germans&#x27; man&quot;.

The meetings between Pétain and Adolf Hitler and between Laval and Hitler are often used as evidence of Vichy collaboration with the Nazis. In fact, Montoire (24–26 October 1940) was a disappointment to both sides. Hitler wanted France to declare war on Britain, and the French wanted improved relations with their conqueror. Neither happened, and virtually the only concession that the French obtained was the &#x27;Berlin Protocol&#x27; of 16 November 1940, which provided for the release of certain categories of French prisoners-of-war.

In November 1940, Laval took a number of pro-German decisions of his own, without consulting with colleagues. The most notorious examples concerned turning the RTB Bor copper mines and the Belgian gold reserves over to German control. After the war, Laval&#x27;s justification, apart from a denial that he acted unilaterally, was that Vichy was powerless to prevent the Germans from gaining something that they were clearly so eager to obtain.

=== Dismissal, 1940–1942 ===
Laval&#x27;s actions were a factor in his dismissal on 13 December 1940. Pétain asked all of the ministers to sign a collective letter of resignation during a full cabinet meeting. Laval did so since he thought that it was a device to get rid of Labour Minister M. Belin. Laval was therefore stunned when Pétain announced, &quot;the resignations of MM. Laval and Ripert are accepted&quot;. That evening, Laval was arrested and driven by the police to his home in Châteldon. The following day, Pétain announced his decision to remove Laval from the government and replace him with Pierre-Étienne Flandin. The reason was a fundamental incompatibility with Pétain. Laval&#x27;s methods of working appeared slovenly to Petain&#x27;s precise military mind, and Laval showed a marked lack of deference, as instanced by a habit of blowing cigarette smoke in Pétain&#x27;s face. By doing so, he aroused Pétain&#x27;s irritation and the anger of the entire cabinet.

Laval was detained under house arrest for some time, but was released after the intervention of German ambassador Otto Abetz, who had him brought to Paris, where he lived under German protection, while continuing to take part in the public and political life.

On 27 August 1941, several top Vichyites, including Laval, attended a review of the Légion des Volontaires Français (LVF), a collaborationist militia. Paul Collette, a member of the Croix-de-Feu, shot Laval (and also Marcel Déat, another prominent collaborationist), during a troop review and slightly wounded him, but Laval soon recovered from the injury.

===Return to power, 1942–1944===
Laval returned to power in April 1942. In an infamous radio speech on 22 June 1942, Laval outlined his policy objectives by expressing his &quot;desire to re-establish normal and trusting relations with Germany and Italy&quot;. He added he &quot;wished for a German victory&quot; because otherwise &quot;Bolshevism [would] establish itself everywhere&quot;. The effect of such speech on public opinion was disastrous, since it made clear to everyone that the Vichy government was &quot;de facto&quot; subservient to the Germans; Pétain and the other ministers were also bewildered and highly irritated by Laval&#x27;s nerve.

Laval had been in power for a mere two months when he was faced with the decision of providing forced labour to Germany, which was short of skilled labour because it needed troop replacements on the Eastern Front. Unlike other occupied countries, France was technically protected by the armistice, and its workers could not be simply rounded up for transportation. In the occupied zone, the Germans used intimidation and the control of raw materials to create unemployment and thus create reasons for French labourers to volunteer to work in Germany. Laval received German demands to send more than 300,000 skilled labourers immediately to factories in Germany. Laval delayed by making a counteroffer of one worker in return for one French prisoner-of-war. The proposal was sent to Hitler, and a compromise was reached that one prisoner-of-war would be repatriated for every three workers arriving in Germany.

Laval&#x27;s precise role in the deportation of Jews has been hotly debated by both his accusers and his defenders. The Germans never told the Vichy French authorities about the extermination camps; instead, the French were told that Jews were being deported as forced labour for the Axis war effort. When ordered to have all Jews in France rounded up to be transported to German-occupied Poland, Laval negotiated a compromise by allowing only Jews who were not French citizens to be forfeited to German control. It was estimated that by the end of the war, the Germans had killed 90% of the Jewish population in other occupied countries, but in France, 50% of the prewar French and foreign Jewish population, with perhaps 90% of the purely-French Jewish population still remaining alive. Laval went beyond the orders given to him by the Germans, as he included Jewish children under 16, whom the Germans had given him permission to spare, in the deportations. In his book &quot;Churches and the Holocaust&quot;, Mordecai Paldiel claims that when the Protestant leader Marc Boegner visited Laval to remonstrate, Laval claimed that he had ordered children to be deported along with their parents because families should not be separated, and &quot;children should remain with their parents&quot;. According to Paldiel, when Boegner argued that the children would almost certainly die, Laval replied that &quot;not one [Jewish child] must remain in France&quot;. It was believed that Laval also attempted to prevent Jewish children gaining visas to the United States that had been arranged by the American Friends Service Committee and that Laval was committed less to expelling Jewish children from France than to making sure they reached Nazi camps.
More and more, the insoluble dilemma of collaboration faced Laval and his chief of staff, Jean Jardin; Laval had to maintain Vichy&#x27;s authority to prevent Germany from installing a puppet government, which would be made up of French Nazis such as Jacques Doriot.

When the Allied landings in French North Africa (Operation Torch) began in November 1942, Germany and Italy occupied the &quot;Zone libre&quot;, thus ending any factual sovereignty of the Vichy government over Metropolitan France. Hitler continued to ask whether the French government was prepared to fight at his side and required Vichy to declare war against Britain: Laval and Pétain agreed to maintain a firm refusal, struggling against ultracollaborationist ministers.

In 1943, Laval became the nominal leader of the newly created &quot;Milice&quot;, but its operational leader was Secretary General Joseph Darnand. In a speech broadcast during the Normandy landings in June 1944, Laval appealed to the nation:In August 1944, as Allied forces were approaching Paris, Laval attempted a last-ditch plot to prevent De Gaulle or the Communist Party from taking power: with permission from the Germans, he attempted to call back the National Assembly (which had not been meeting since 1940) with the goal of giving it the power to form a government that could be seen as legitimate. With the endorsement of German ambassador Otto Abetz, Laval had Édouard Herriot, President of the Chamber of Deputies, released from imprisonment and brought back to Paris, so that he could re-convene the Parliament; the President of the Senate Jules Jeanneney was also contacted, but could not be found. Laval&#x27;s machinations failed: after being initially collaborative, Herriot refused to go on with the plan due to the absence of Jeanneney, while the Germans changed their minds after the intervention of the ultracollaborationists Marcel Déat and Fernand de Brinon. On 17 August Herriot was arrested by the Germans and deported to Laxou and then to Potsdam, thus ending any possibility of recalling the Assembly.

=== Exile in Sigmaringen and Spain, 1944–1945 ===
On the same day, Laval and some others were also arrested by the Germans and transported to Belfort, where they arrived on 19 August. 
In view of the speed of the Allied advance, what was left of the Vichy government was moved on 7 September 1944 from Belfort to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany. Pétain took residence at the Hohenzollern castle in Sigmaringen. At first, Laval also resided in that castle. In January 1945 Laval was assigned to the Stauffenberg castle in Wilflingen, 12 km outside the Sigmaringen enclave. By April 1945, US General George S. Patton&#x27;s army approached Sigmaringen and so the Vichy ministers were forced to seek their own refuge. Laval received permission to enter Spain and was flown to Barcelona by a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; plane. However, 90 days later, Charles de Gaulle pressured Spain to expel Laval. The same &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; plane that had flown him to Spain then flew him to the American-occupied zone of Austria. He had attempted to seek refuge in Liechtenstein, but was turned away. The American authorities immediately arrested Laval and his wife and turned them over to the Free French. They were flown to Paris to be imprisoned at Fresnes Prison. Madame Laval was later released, but Pierre Laval remained in prison to be tried for treason.

Prior to his arrest, Laval had planned to move to Sintra, Portugal, where a house had been leased for him.

==Trial and execution==

Two trials were to be held. Although it was said to have had its faults, the Pétain trial permitted the presentation and examination of a vast amount of pertinent material. Numerous scholars, including Robert Paxton and Geoffrey Warner, believe that Laval&#x27;s trial demonstrated the inadequacies of the judicial system and the poisonous political atmosphere of that purge-trial era. During his imprisonment pending the verdict of his treason trial, Laval wrote his only book, the posthumously published &quot;Diary&quot; (1948). His daughter, Josée de Chambrun, smuggled it out of the prison page by page.

Laval firmly believed that he would be able to convince his fellow countrymen that he had been acting in their best interests all along. &quot;Father-in-law wants a big trial which will illuminate everything&quot;, René de Chambrun told Laval&#x27;s lawyers: &quot;If he is given time to prepare his defence, if he is allowed to speak, to call witnesses and to obtain from abroad the information and documents which he needs, he will confound his accusers&quot;. &quot;Do you want me to tell you the setup?&quot; Laval asked one of his lawyers on 4 August. &quot;There will be no pre-trial hearings and no trial. I will be condemned – and got rid of – before the elections&quot;.

Laval&#x27;s trial began at 1:30 pm on Thursday, 4 October 1945. He was charged with plotting against the security of the State and intelligence (collaboration) with the enemy. He had three defence lawyers (Jaques Baraduc, Albert Naud and Yves-Frédéric Jaffré). None of his lawyers had met him before. He dealt mostly with Jaffré, who sat with him, talked, listened and took down notes that he wanted to dictate. Baraduc, who quickly became convinced of Laval&#x27;s innocence, kept contact with the Chambruns and at first shared their conviction that Laval would be acquitted or at most would receive a sentence of temporary exile. Naud, who had been a member of the Resistance, believed Laval to be guilty and urged him to plead that he had made grave errors but had acted under constraint. Laval would not listen to him and was convinced that he was innocent and could prove it. &quot;He acted&quot;, said Naud, &quot;as if his career, not his life, was at stake&quot;.

All three of his lawyers declined to be in court to hear the reading of the formal charges: &quot;We fear that the haste which has been employed to open the hearings is inspired, not by judicial preoccupations, but motivated by political considerations&quot;. In lieu of attending the hearing, they sent letters stating the shortcomings and asked to be discharged as counsel. The court carried on without them. The president of the court, Pierre Mongibeaux, announced that the trial had to be completed before the general election scheduled for 21 October. Mongibeaux and Mornet, the public prosecutor, were unable to control constant hostile outbursts from the jury. They occurred as heated exchanges between Mongibeaux and Laval became louder and louder. On the third day, Laval&#x27;s three lawyers were with him as the President of the Bar Association had advised them to resume their duties.

After the adjournment, Mongibeaux announced that the part of the interrogation dealing with the charge of plotting against the security of the state was concluded. To the charge of collaboration, Laval replied, &quot;Monsieur le Président, the insulting way in which you questioned me earlier and the demonstrations in which some members of the jury indulged show me that I may be the victim of a judicial crime. I do not want to be an accomplice; I prefer to remain silent&quot;. Mongibeaux called the first of the prosecution witnesses, but they had not expected to testify so soon, and none was present. Mongibeaux adjourned the hearing for the second time so that the witnesses could be located. When the court reassembled half an hour later, Laval was no longer in his place.

Although Pierre-Henri Teitgen, the Minister of Justice in Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s cabinet, personally appealed to Laval&#x27;s lawyers to have him attend the hearings, they declined to do so. Teitgen freely confirmed the conduct of Mongibeaux and Mornet and professed that he was unable to do anything to curb them. A sentence of death was handed down in Laval&#x27;s absence. His lawyers were refused a retrial.

The execution was fixed for the morning of 15 October at Fresnes Prison. Laval attempted to commit suicide before the sentence could be carried out by taking poison from a vial stitched inside the lining of his jacket. He did not intend, he explained in a suicide note, that French soldiers should become accomplices in a &quot;judicial crime&quot;. The poison, however, was so old that it was ineffective and so repeated stomach-pumpings revived Laval. Laval requested for his lawyers to witness his execution. He was shot and shouted, &quot;Vive la France!&quot; Laval&#x27;s wife declared to an English newspaper, &quot;It is not the French way to try a man without letting him speak. That&#x27;s the way he always fought against – the German way.&quot;

His corpse was initially buried in an unmarked grave in the Thiais cemetery until it was buried in the Chambrun family mausoleum at the Montparnasse Cemetery in November 1945.

His daughter, Josée Laval, wrote a letter to Winston Churchill in 1948 and suggested that the firing squad who killed her father &quot;wore British uniforms&quot;. The letter was published in the June 1949 issue of &quot;Human Events&quot;, an American conservative newspaper.

The High Court, which functioned until 1949, judged 108 cases and pronounced eight death penalties, including one for an elderly Pétain, whose appeal failed. Only three of the death penalties were carried out: those of Laval; Fernand de Brinon, Vichy&#x27;s Ambassador in Paris to the German authorities; and Joseph Darnand, the head of the Milice.

== Legacy and assessment ==
Laval&#x27;s manifold political activities left a complicated and controversial legacy, which have resulted in more than a dozen conflicting biographies of him.

In his memoirs, Otto Abetz, German Ambassador to France from 1940 to 1944, subsequently described Laval in high terms:He was one of the greatest statesmen of our time, and, in any case, its last truly great liberal politician.A more balanced approach was laid down by Charles de Gaulle in his own memoir:Naturally inclined, accustomed by the regime, to approach matters from below, Laval held that, whatever happens, it is important to be in power, that a certain degree of astuteness always controls the situation, that there is no event that cannot be turned around, no men that cannot be handled. He had, in the cataclysm, felt the misfortune of the country but also the opportunity to take the reins and apply on a vast scale the capacity he had to deal with anything. But the victorious Reich was a partner who did not intend to compromise. For, despite everything [...] he had to embrace the disaster of France. He accepted the condition. He judged that it was possible to take advantage of the worst, to use even the point of servitude, to even associate oneself with the invader, to make oneself an asset of the most terrible repression. To carry out his policy, he renounced the honor of the country, the independence of the State, and national pride. Now, these elements reappeared alive and demanding as the enemy weakened. Laval had played. He had lost. He had the courage to admit that he was responsible for the consequences. No doubt, in his government, deploying all the resources of ruse, all the resources of obstinacy to support the unsustainable, he sought to serve his country. Let that be left to him!

<text>Public law is the part of law that governs relations and affairs between legal persons and a government, between different institutions within a state, between different branches of governments, as well as relationships between persons that are of direct concern to society. Public law comprises constitutional law, administrative law, tax law and criminal law, as well as all procedural law. Laws concerning relationships between individuals belong to private law.

The relationships public law governs are asymmetric and unequalized. Government bodies (central or local) can make decisions about the rights of persons. However, as a consequence of the rule-of-law doctrine, authorities may only act within the law (&quot;secundum et intra legem&quot;). The government must obey the law. For example, a citizen unhappy with a decision of an administrative authority can ask a court for judicial review.

The distinction between public law and private law dates back to Roman law, where the Roman jurist Ulpian ( 170 – 228) first noted it. It was later adopted to understand the legal systems both of countries that adhere to the civil-law tradition, and of those that adhere to common-law tradition.

The borderline between public law and private law is not always clear. Law as a whole cannot neatly be divided into &quot;law for the State&quot; and &quot;law for everyone else&quot;. As such, the distinction between public and private law is largely functional rather than factual, classifying laws according to which domain the activities, participants, and principal concerns involved best fit into. This has given rise to attempts to establish a theoretical understanding for the basis of public law.

==History of public law==

The distinction between public and private law was first made by Roman jurist Ulpian, who argues in the &quot;Institutes&quot; (in a passage preserved by Justinian in the &quot;Digest&quot; ) that &quot;[p]ublic law is that which respects the establishment of the Roman commonwealth, private that which respects individuals&#x27; interests, some matters being of public and others of private interest.&quot; Furthermore, he defines public law as the law concerning religious affairs, the priesthood, and offices of the State. Roman Law conceived of the law as a series of relationships between persons and persons, persons and things, and persons and the State. Public law consisted of the latter of these three relationships. However, Roman lawyers devoted little attention to this area, and instead focussed largely on areas of private law. It was, however, of great importance in Teutonic society, as noted by German legal historian Otto von Gierke, who defined the Teutons as the fathers of public law.

Drawing a line between public and private law largely fell out of favor in the ensuing millennium, though, as Ernst Kantorowicz notes, Medieval jurists saw a concern with the Roman conception of the &quot;res publica&quot; inherent in the legal fiction of the king&#x27;s two bodies. However, legal philosophers during this period were largely theologians who operated within the realm of Canon Law, and were therefore instead concerned with distinctions between divine law, natural law, and human law. The &quot;public/private&quot; divide in law would not return until the 17th and 18th centuries. Through the emergence of the nation-state and new theories of sovereignty, notions of a distinctly public realm began to crystalize. However, the claims made by monarchs, and later parliaments, to an unrestrained power to make law spurred attempts to establish a distinctly private sphere that would be free from encroaching State power in return.

==Public law in civil law and common law jurisdictions==
Traditionally, the division between public and private law has been made in the context of the legal systems found in Continental Europe, whose laws all fall within the tradition of civil law. However, the public/private divide does not apply strictly to civil law systems. Given public law&#x27;s emphasis on aspects of the State that are true of all systems of government and law, common law legal systems acknowledge, even if they do so unconsciously, that actions which must be prohibited by the State need not necessarily be prohibited for private parties as well. As such, legal scholars commenting on common law systems, such as England and Canada, have made this distinction as well.

For many years, public law occupied a marginal position in continental European law. By and large, private law was considered &quot;general law&quot;. Public law, on the other hand, was considered to consist of exceptions to this general law. It was not until the second half of the twentieth century that public law began to play a prominent role in European society through the constitutionalization of private law, as well as the development of administrative law and various functional fields of law, including labor law, medical law, and consumer law. Though this began to blur the distinction between public and private law, it did not erode the former. Instead, it elevated public law from its once marginal state, with an acknowledgment that there are few, if any, areas of the law that are free from potential State intervention. In Italy, for example, the development of public law was considered a project of state-building, following the ideas of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. Indeed, many early Italian public lawyers were also politicians, including Orlando himself. Now, in countries such as France, public law now refers to the areas of constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law.

==Areas of public law==

=== Constitutional law ===

In modern states, constitutional law lays out the foundations of the state. Above all, it postulates the supremacy of law in the functioning of the state – the rule of law.

Secondly, it sets out the form of government – how its different branches work, how they are elected or appointed, and the division of powers and responsibilities between them. Traditionally, the basic elements of government are the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.

And thirdly, in describing what are the basic human rights, which must be protected for every person, and what further civil and political rights citizens have, it sets the fundamental borders to what &quot;any&quot; government must and must not do.

In most jurisdictions, constitutional law is enshrined in a written document, the Constitution, sometimes together with amendments or other constitutional laws. In some countries, however, such a supreme entrenched written document does not exist for historical and political reasons – the Constitution of the United Kingdom is an unwritten one.

=== Administrative law ===

Administrative law refers to the body of law that regulates bureaucratic managerial procedures and defines the powers of administrative agencies. These laws are enforced by the executive branch of a government rather than the judicial or legislative branches (if they are different in that particular jurisdiction). This body of law regulates international trade, manufacturing, pollution, taxation, and the like. This is sometimes seen as a subcategory of civil law and sometimes seen as public law as it deals with regulation and public institutions

=== Criminal law ===

Criminal law is the body of law that relates to crime. It prescribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and welfare of people inclusive of one&#x27;s self. Most criminal law is established by statute, which is to say that the laws are enacted by a legislature. Criminal law includes the punishment and rehabilitation of people who violate such laws.

=== Tax law ===
Tax law first became an area of public law during the 17th century, as a consequence of new theories of sovereignty that began to emerge. Until this point, taxes were considered gifts under the law, given to the State by a private donor – the taxpayer. It is now considered an area of public law, as it concerns a relationship between persons and the State.

==Theoretical distinction between private and public law==
The analytical and historical distinction between public and private law has emerged predominantly in the legal systems of continental Europe. As a result, German-language legal literature has produced extensive discussion on the precise nature of the distinction between public law and private law. Several theories have evolved, which are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive or separate.

The interest theory of public law emerges from the work of Roman jurist Ulpian, who stated &quot;&quot;Publicum ius est, quod ad statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum quod ad singulorum utilitatem.&quot; (Public law is that which concerns the Roman state, and private law is concerned with the interests of citizens.) Charles-Louis Montesquieu elaborates upon this theory in &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;, published during the 18th century, wherein Montesquieu establishes a distinction between international (right of nations), public (political right), and private (civil right) law according to various actors interests and rights. There, he writes: &quot;Considered as inhabitants of a planet so large that different peoples are necessary, they have laws bearing on the relation that these peoples have with one another, and this is the . Considered as living in a society that must be maintained, they have laws concerning the relation between those who govern and those who are governed, and this is the . Further, they have laws concerning the relation that all citizens have with one another, and this is the .&quot;

Criticisms of interest theory include the difficulty in establishing a clear distinction between private and public interest if such a distinction does exist, and categorizing laws accordingly.

The subjection theory focuses on explaining the distinction by emphasizing the subordination of private persons to the state. Public law is supposed to govern this relationship, whereas private law is considered to govern relationships where the parties involved meet on a level playing field. However, some areas commonly considered private law also imply subordination, such as employment law. Moreover, legal proceedings wherein the State is a party may undermine the totality of the State&#x27;s authority, and the degree to which private persons are subordinate to the State if a Court finds in favor of a non-state party (see Carpenter v. United States, for example).

The subject theory is concerned with the position of the subject of law in the legal relationship in question. If it finds itself in a particular situation as a public person (due to membership in some public body, such as a state or a municipality), public law applies, otherwise it is private law.

A combination of the subjection theory and the subject theory arguably provides a workable distinction. Under this approach, a field of law is considered public law where one actor is a public authority endowed with the power to act unilaterally (&quot;imperium&quot;) and this actor uses that &quot;imperium&quot; in the particular relationship. In other words, it all depends on whether the public authority is acting as a public or a private entity, say when ordering office supplies. This latest theory considers public law a special instance.

There are areas of law that do not seem to fit into either public or private law, such as employment law – parts of it look like private law (the employment contract) while other parts look like public law (the activities of an employment inspectorate when investigating workplace safety).

The distinction between public and private law has a bearing on the delineation between the competencies of different courts and administrative bodies. Under the Austrian constitution, for example, private law is among the exclusive competencies of federal legislation, whereas public law is partly a matter of state legislation.

<text>David Kirkwood, 1st Baron Kirkwood, PC (8 July 1872 – 16 April 1955), was a Scottish politician, trade unionist and socialist activist from the East End of Glasgow, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for nearly 30 years, and was as a leading figure of the Red Clydeside era.

==Biography==
Kirkwood was born in Glasgow to John Kirkwood, a labourer, and his wife Jean. Kirkwood was educated at Parkhead Public School, but left at age 12 to take employment, and was trained as an engineer. Kirkwood&#x27;s earliest political involvement was through his trade union, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (which he joined at age 20), and the Socialist Labour Party, which he left in 1914 to join the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He was recognised as the Scottish engineers&#x27; leader for many years.

Kirkwood served on the Glasgow Trade Council and was a member of the Clyde Workers&#x27; Committee (CWC) chaired by Willie Gallacher. The CWC grew out of the Clyde engineers&#x27; pay dispute of 1915. Until its effective suppression in early-1916, it organised shop floor opposition to the policies of the Ministry of Munitions with regard to Leaving Certificates and Dilution of Labour. Kirkwood was the convenor of shop stewards at Parkhead Forge of William Beardmore and Company, where, in January 1916 he helped to secure a dilution agreement. 

In March 1916, as a result of a strike related to the implementation of the agreement, Kirkwood was arrested and deported from Glasgow to Edinburgh, an event which greatly increased his profile. He returned to Glasgow in 1917, and was employed as foreman at the Mile-End Shell Factory. 

In January 1919, Kirkwood was prominently associated with the 40 Hours&#x27; Strike. Batoned and arrested along with Wilie Gallacher and Manny Shinwell, at a riot in George Square, Glasgow, he was tried for incitement to riot and acquitted. At the 1922 general election, Kirkwood was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) Dumbarton Burghs. He had previously served for four years on Glasgow Town Council. On 9 May 1924 the Speaker of the House of Commons adjourned the debate when Kirkwood and James Maxton caused an uproar after the Opposition talked out George Buchanan&#x27;s Scottish Home Rule Bill.

Kirkwood was one of the leading figures of the ILP in Parliament as it came into increasing conflict with the Labour Party. At the 1931 general election, he was returned as one of five ILP MPs without Labour Party support. However, when the ILP, with the support of James Maxton, decided to disaffiliate from the Labour Party in 1932 this was a step too far for Kirkwood, and he left the ILP to join the new Scottish Socialist Party and again took the Labour Party whip. Kirkwood published his autobiography, &quot;My Life of Revolt&quot; in 1935.

In January 1931, the ocean liner &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was laid down in Kirkwood&#x27;s constituency on the Clydebank by John Brown &amp; Company for the Cunard Line. However, work was halted due to lack of funds and the workers were made redundant on 11 December. Kirkwood campaigned throughout 1932 to save the ship and he enlisted the help of the Prince of Wales. His campaign succeeded when the UK Government passed the North Atlantic Shipping Act 1934, which included a government loan to the company of £9,500,000 and the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was completed in 1934. 

£5 million of the government&#x27;s loan was intended for the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;&#x27;s sister ship, the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. When the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was laid down in 1936, the chairman of Cunard, Percy Bates, wrote to Kirkwood: &quot;Your share in the responsibility is perhaps larger than you might expect. They might not have had the courage to borrow the money but for your belief in the men of the Clyde&quot;.

Kirkwood was a supporter of Home Rule for Scotland. In 1935, Gilbert McAllister said that Kirkwood, &quot;courteous to all men but bowing to none, divides his affections among porridge and politics, the Bible and Burns, Scottish Home Rule and Socialism, his family and &quot;ma people in Clydebank&quot;.

Kirkwood became a Privy Counsellor in 1948. When his constituency was abolished at the 1950 general election, he was elected for the new constituency of East Dunbartonshire. He left the Commons in 1951 and was created Baron Kirkwood of Bearsden, on 22 December 1951. Kirkwood died on 16 April 1955, at the age of 82.

<text>NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode (, ) is a mobile internet (distinct from wireless internet) service popular in Japan. Unlike Wireless Application Protocols, i-mode encompasses a wider variety of internet standards, including web access, e-mail, and the packet-switched network that delivers the data. i-mode users also have access to other various services such as: sports results, weather forecasts, games, financial services, and ticket booking. Content is provided by specialised services, typically from the mobile carrier, which allows them to have tighter control over billing.

Like WAP, i-mode delivers only those services that are specifically converted for the service, or are converted through gateways.

==Description==

In contrast with the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) standard, which used Wireless Markup Language (WML) on top of a protocol stack for wireless handheld devices, i-mode borrows from DoCoMo proprietary protocols ALP (HTTP) and TLP (TCP, UDP), as well as fixed Internet data formats such as C-HTML, a subset of the HTML language designed by DoCoMo. C-HTML was designed for small devices (e.g. cellular phones) with hardware restrictions such as lower memory, low-power CPUs with limited or no storage capabilities, small monochrome display screens, single-character fonts and limited input methods. As a simpler form of HTML, C-HTML does not support tables, image maps, multiple fonts and styling of fonts, background colors and images, frames, or style sheets, and is limited to a monochromatic display.

i-mode phones have a special i-mode button for the user to access the start menu. There are more than 12,000 official sites and around 100,000 or more unofficial i-mode sites, which are not linked to DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode portal page and DoCoMo&#x27;s billing services. NTT DoCoMo supervises the content and operations of all official i-mode sites, most of which are commercial. These official sites are accessed through DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode menu but in many cases official sites can also be accessed from mobile phones by typing the URL or through the use of QR code (a barcode).

An i-mode user pays for both sent and received data. There are services to avoid unsolicited e-mails. The basic monthly charge is typically on the order of JPY¥200300 for i-mode not including the data transfer charges, with additional charges on a monthly subscription basis for premium services. A variety of discount plans exist, for example family discount and flat packet plans for unlimited transfer of data at a fixed monthly charge (on the order of ¥4,000 per month).

==History==
i-mode was launched in Japan on 22 February 1999. The content planning and service design team was led by Mari Matsunaga, while Takeshi Natsuno was responsible for the business development. Top executive Keiichi Enoki oversaw the technical and overall development. A few months after DoCoMo launched i-mode in February 1999, DoCoMo&#x27;s competitors launched very similar mobile data services: KDDI launched EZweb, and J-Phone launched J-Sky. Vodafone later acquired J-Phone including J-Sky, renaming the service Vodafone live!, although initially this was different from Vodafone live! in Europe and other markets. In addition, Vodafone KK was acquired by SoftBank, an operator of Yahoo! Japan in October, 2006 and changed the name to SoftBank Mobile.

Bandai and Namco launched content for i-mode in 1999. Bandai launched the &quot;Dokodemo Aso Vegas&quot; service in May 1999, reaching over paid subscribers by March 2000. In December 1999, Namco launched &quot;Namco Station&quot;, a mobile site for i-mode.

Since 2003, i-mode center is called CiRCUS, which consists of 400 NEC NX7000 HP-UX servers and occupies 4,600 m2 floor space in DoCoMo&#x27;s Kawasaki office. The operation support system is called CARNiVAL, which is hosted in the Sanno Park Tower.

As of June 2006, the mobile data services I-Mode, EZweb, and J-Sky, had over 80 million subscribers in Japan.

i-mode usage in Japan peaked around 2008. On 29 October 2019, DoCoMo announced i-mode will end on 31 March 2026.

==Markets==
Seeing the tremendous success of i-mode in Japan, many operators in Europe, Asia and Australia sought to license the service through partnership with DoCoMo. Takeshi Natsuno was behind the expansion of i-mode to 17 countries worldwide. Kamel Maamria who was a partner with the Boston Consulting Group and who was supporting Mr. Natsuno is also thought to have had a major role in the expansion of the first Japanese service ever outside Japan.

i-mode showed very fast take-up in the various countries where it was launched which led to more operators seeking to launch i-mode in their markets with the footprint reaching a total of 17 markets worldwide.

While the i-mode service was an exceptional service which positioned DoCoMo as the global leader in value add services, another key success factor for i-mode was the Japanese smartphone makers who developed state of the art handsets to support i-mode. As i-mode was exported to the rest of the world, Nokia and other major handset vendors who controlled the markets at the time, refused at first to support i-mode by developing handsets which support the i-mode service. The operators who decided to launch i-mode had to rely on Japanese vendors who had no experience in international markets. As i-mode showed success in these markets, some vendors started customizing some of their handsets to support i-mode, however, the support was only partial and came late in time.

While the service was successful during the first years after launch, the lack of adequate handsets and the emergence of new handsets from new vendors which supported new Internet services on one hand, and a change of leadership of i-mode in Docomo, lead to a number of operators to migrate or integrate i-mode into new mobile Internet services. These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and i-mode never became popular outside of Japan.

i-mode sponsored the Renault F1 team from 2004 to 2006.

<doc id="287868" wikidata="Q452166" url="?curid=287868" title="Marc Almond">
<text>Peter Mark Almond (born 9 July 1957) is an English singer best known from the synth-pop/new wave duo Soft Cell and for his distinctive soulful voice and androgynous image. He has also had a diverse career as a solo artist. His collaborations include a duet with Gene Pitney on the 1989 UK number one single &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot;. Almond&#x27;s career spanning over four decades has enjoyed critical and commercial acclaim, and he has sold over 30 million records worldwide. He spent a month in a coma after a near-fatal motorcycle accident in 2004 and later became a patron of the brain trauma charity Headway.

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to arts and culture.

==Early life==
Almond was born in Southport, Sefton, the son of Sandra Mary Diesen and Peter John Almond, a Second Lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Liverpool Regiment. He was brought up at his grandparents&#x27; house in Birkdale with his younger sister, and as a child suffered from bronchitis and asthma. When he was four, they left their grandparents&#x27; house and moved to Starbeck, Harrogate. Two years later they returned to Southport, and then moved to Horsforth, Yorkshire. There, he attended Horsforth Featherbank Infant School.

At the age of 11, Almond attended Aireborough Grammar School near Leeds. He found solace in music, listening to radio pioneer John Peel. The first albums he purchased were the soundtrack of the stage musical &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Benefit&quot; by Jethro Tull, and the first singles were &quot;Green Manalishi&quot; by Fleetwood Mac and &quot;Witches Promise&quot; by Jethro Tull. He later became a great fan of Marc Bolan and David Bowie, and got a part-time job as a stable boy to fund his music listening. After his parents&#x27; divorce in 1972, he moved with his mother back to Southport where he attended King George V School. He gained two O-Levels in Art and English and was accepted onto a General Art and Design course at Southport College, specialising in Performance Art.

Almond applied to Leeds Polytechnic, where he was interviewed by Jeff Nuttall, also a performance artist, who accepted him on the strength of his performing skills. During his time at art college, he did a series of performance theatre pieces: &quot;Zazou&quot;, &quot;Glamour in Squalor&quot;, &quot;Twilights and Lowlifes&quot;, as well as Andy Warhol inspired mini-movies. &quot;Zazou&quot; was reviewed by &quot;The Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; and described as &quot;one of the most nihilistic depressing pieces that I have ever had the misfortune to see&quot;, prompting Almond to later refer to it as a &quot;success&quot; in his autobiography. He left art college with a 2:1 honours degree. He later credited writer and artist Molly Parkin with discovering him. It was at Leeds Polytechnic that Almond met David Ball, a fellow student; they formed Soft Cell in 1977.

As a child, Almond listened to his parents&#x27; record collection, which included his mother&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; by Chris Montez and &quot;The Twist&quot; by Chubby Checker, as well as his father&#x27;s collection of jazz, including Dave Brubeck and Eartha Kitt. As an adolescent, Almond listened to Radio Caroline and Radio Luxembourg. He listened at first to progressive music, blues, and rock, and bands such as Free, Jethro Tull, Van der Graaf Generator, the Who, and the Doors. He bought the first ever issue of &quot;Sounds&quot; because it contained a free poster of Jimmy Page. Almond became a fan of Bolan after hearing him on &quot;The John Peel Show&quot;, buying the T. Rex single &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot;. From then on, Almond &quot;followed everything Marc Bolan did&quot; and it was his obsession with Bolan that prompted Almond to adopt the &quot;Marc&quot; spelling of his name. He discovered the songs of Jacques Brel through Bowie as well as Alex Harvey and Dusty Springfield. Brel became a major influence.

==Career==

===1980s===
Almond and Dave Ball formed the synthesiser-based duo Soft Cell and signed to the Some Bizzare label. Their hits included &quot;Tainted Love&quot; (UK No. 1), &quot;Bedsitter&quot; (UK No. 4), &quot;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye&quot; (UK No. 3), &quot;Torch&quot; (UK No. 2), &quot;What!&quot; (UK No. 3), &quot;Soul Inside&quot; (UK No. 16), and the club hit &quot;Memorabilia&quot;. Soft Cell&#x27;s first release was an independent record (funded by Dave Ball&#x27;s mother) entitled &quot;Mutant Moments&quot; via Red Rhino Records in 1980.

&quot;Mutant Moments&quot; came to the attention of music entrepreneur Stevo Pearce, who at the time was compiling a &quot;futurist&quot; chart for the music papers Record Mirror and &quot;Sounds&quot; which featured young, upcoming and experimental bands of the new wave of electronic sound. He signed the duo to his Some Bizzare label and they enjoyed a string of nine Top 40 hit singles and four Top 20 albums in the UK between 1981 and 1984. They recorded three albums in New York with producer Mike Thorne: &quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing&quot; and &quot;The Art of Falling Apart&quot;. Almond became involved with the New York Underground Art Scene at this time with writer/DJ Anita Sarko, which led him to meet artists including Andy Warhol and perform at a number of Art events.

&quot;Tainted Love&quot;, a cover of a Gloria Jones Northern Soul classic, was number one in the UK and in many countries over the world, and was in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for a while as the record that spent the longest time in the Billboard Top 100 chart in the US. It also won the best-single award of 1981 at the first Brit Awards. Soft Cell brought an otherwise obscure Northern Soul classic to mass public attention and their version of the song is, to date, the UK&#x27;s 59th best-selling single of all time, selling over one million copies in the UK.

Marc also became friends with JG Thirlwell and, in 1983, as Clint Ruin, Thirlwell performed with Soft Cell on the Channel 4 show The Switch. Marc travelled to New York with Thirlwell and Nick Cave, where they became part of The Immaculate Consumptive with Lydia Lunch. Almond and Thirlwell continued to work together, ultimately culminating in the Flesh Volcano single in 1987.

In 1982, Almond formed Marc and the Mambas as an offshoot project from Soft Cell. Marc and the Mambas was a loose experimental collective that set the template for the artist that Almond would become. The Mambas at various times included Matt Johnson, Steve James Sherlock, Lee Jenkinson, Peter Ashworth, Jim Thirlwell and Annie Hogan, with whom Almond worked later in his solo career. Under the Mambas moniker, Almond recorded two albums, &quot;Untitled&quot; and the double-album &quot;Torment and Toreros&quot;. He disbanded the collective when it started to feel too much like a regular band.

Soft Cell disbanded in 1984 just before the release of their fourth album, &quot;This Last Night in Sodom&quot;, but the duo briefly reunited in 2001 and again in 2018.

Almond&#x27;s first proper solo album was &quot;Vermin in Ermine&quot;, released in 1984. Produced by Mike Hedges, it featured musicians from the Mambas outfit, Annie Hogan, Martin McCarrick and Billy McGee. This ensemble, known as The Willing Sinners, worked alongside Almond for the subsequent albums &quot;Stories of Johnny&quot; (1985) from which the title track became a minor hit, and &quot;Mother Fist and Her Five Daughters&quot; (1987), also produced by Mike Hedges. The latter album was highly acclaimed in reviews, with Ned Raggett writing that the &#x27;Mother Fist&#x27; album &quot;embraces classic European cabaret to wonderful effect, more so than any American or English rock album since Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; or Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Berlin&quot;.&quot;

McCarrick left The Willing Sinners in 1987 to join Siouxsie and the Banshees, from which point Hogan and McGee became known as La Magia. Almond signed to EMI and released the album &quot;The Stars We Are&quot; in 1988. This album featured Almond&#x27;s version of &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot;, which was later re-recorded as a duet with the song&#x27;s original singer Gene Pitney and released as a single. The track reached No. 1 in the UK. It also reached number one in Germany and was a major hit in countries around the world. &quot;The Stars We Are&quot; became his biggest selling solo album in the US, and the single &quot;Tears Run Rings&quot; became his only solo single to peak inside the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Almond&#x27;s other recordings in the 1980s included an album of Brel songs, called &quot;Jacques&quot;, and an album of dark French chansons originally performed by Juliette Gréco, Serge Lama and Léo Ferré, as well as poems by Rimbaud and Baudelaire set to music. This album was released in 1993 as &quot;Absinthe&quot;, and was initially recorded in the late 1980s then finished in Paris in the early 1990s.

===1990s===
Almond&#x27;s first release in the 1990s was the album &quot;Enchanted&quot;, which spawned the UK Top 30 hit &quot;A Lover Spurned&quot;. A further single from the album, &quot;Waifs and Strays&quot;, was remixed by Dave Ball who was now in the electronic dance band The Grid. In 1991, Soft Cell returned to the charts with a new remix of &quot;Say Hello Wave Goodbye&quot; followed by a re-release of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; (with a new video). The singles were issued to promote a new Soft Cell/Marc Almond compilation album, &quot;Memorabilia - The Singles&quot;, which collected some of the biggest hits from Almond&#x27;s career throughout the previous ten years. The album reached the UK Top 10.

Almond then signed to WEA and released a new solo album, &quot;Tenement Symphony&quot;. Produced partly by Trevor Horn, the album yielded three Top 40 hits including renditions of the Jacques Brel classic &quot;Jacky&quot; (which made the UK Top 20), and &quot;The Days of Pearly Spencer&quot; which returned Almond to the UK Top 5 in 1992. Later that year, Almond played a lavish one-off show at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which featured an orchestra and dancers as he performed material from his entire career. The show was recorded and released as the CD and video &quot;12 Years of Tears&quot;.

In 1993 Almond toured Russia (including Siberia) by invitation of the British consul in Moscow. Accompanied only by Martin Watkins on piano, he played small Soviet halls and theatres, often without amplification, and ended at the &quot;mini Bolshoi&quot; in Moscow. Transmitted live on television Almond made a plea for tolerance of gay people. The tour was fraught with troubles, which Almond detailed in his autobiography, but it marked the beginning of his love affair with the genre of Russian folk torch songs known as Romance.

Almond&#x27;s next album &quot;Fantastic Star&quot; saw him part with WEA and sign to Mercury Records. Much of &quot;Fantastic Star&quot; was originally recorded in New York with Mike Thorne, but later after signing to Mercury, was reworked in London. Almond also recorded a session for the album with John Cale, David Johanson, and Chris Spedding; some made the final cut. Other songs were produced by Mike Hedges and Martyn Ware. Adding to the disjointed recording process was the fact that during recording Almond also spent several weeks attending a treatment centre in Canterbury for addiction to prescription drugs. However, on its release &quot;Fantastic Star&quot; gave Almond a hit single with &quot;Adored and Explored&quot;, and also minor hits and stage favourites such as &quot;The Idol&quot; and &quot;Child Star&quot;. &quot;Fantastic Star&quot; was Almond&#x27;s last album with WEA and also marked the ending of his managerial relationship with Stevo Pearce.

Almond signed to Echo records in 1998 with a more downbeat and atmospheric electronica album, &quot;Open All Night&quot;. This featured R&amp;B and trip hop influences, as well as torch songs for which he had become known. The album featured a duet (&quot;Threat of Love&quot;) with Siouxsie Sioux as well as one (&quot;Almost Diamonds&quot;) with Kelli Ali (then of the Sneaker Pimps). &quot;Black Kiss&quot;, &quot;Tragedy&quot; and &quot;My Love&quot; were the singles from the album &quot;Open All Night&quot;.

===2000s===
Almond relocated in 2000 to Moscow where he rented an apartment. With the encouragement and connections of executive producer Misha Kucherenko, he embarked on a three-year recording project of Russian romance and folk songs, called &quot;Heart on Snow&quot;. Featuring many Russian stars old and new such as Boris Grebenshchikov, Ilya Lagutenko of the Russian band Mumiy Troll, Lyudmila Zykina and Alla Bayanova and featuring The Rossiya Folk Orchestra conducted by Anatole Sobolev, it was the first time that such a project had been undertaken by a Western artist, many of the loved Soviet era songs sung in English for the first time. The album was produced by musician/arranger Andrei Samsonov. Almond performed many times at the famous, and now demolished, Rossiya Concert Hall with Lyudmila Zykina and Alla Bayanova, and with the Rossiya Folk Orchestra.

In 2001, Soft Cell reunited briefly and released their first new album in 18 years, &quot;Cruelty Without Beauty&quot;. Two singles came out of this album, &quot;Monoculture&quot; and a cover of the Frankie Valli&#x27;s &quot;The Night&quot;, which led to a Top of the Pops appearance for the band, their first since the mid-1980s. Almond also presented &quot;New Music Television&quot; that year.

Almond released &quot;Stranger Things&quot; in 2001.

In October 2004, Almond was seriously injured in a motorbike accident near St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. Near death and in a coma for weeks, he suffered two huge blood clots and had to undergo emergency surgery twice. He also suffered serious head injuries, multiple breaks and fractures, a collapsed lung and damaged hearing. He began a slow recovery determined to get back on the stage and in the studio.

In June 2007, Almond released an album of cover songs, &quot;Stardom Road&quot;. Picked to tell a story of his life and career, the album featured songs as diverse as &quot;I Have Lived&quot; by Charles Aznavour, to &quot;Stardom Road&quot; by Third World War, Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, and &quot;Kitsch&quot; by Paul Ryan. The album featured his first new song since the motorbike accident, &quot;Redeem me (Beauty Will Redeem the World)&quot;. &quot;Stardom Road&quot; was to be one of three albums for the Sanctuary label, the UK&#x27;s largest independent record label up until 2007 when it got itself into financial difficulty and was sold off in June 2007 to Universal Music Group. In July 2007, Almond celebrated his 50th birthday on stage at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London and in September performed at a tribute show to Marc Bolan, his teenage hero. At the concert he dueted with Bolan&#x27;s wife, Gloria Jones, on an impromptu version of &quot;Tainted Love&quot;. In October 2007, the fashion house &quot;Yves Saint Laurent&quot; picked Almond&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; to represent their show at London&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Rocks&quot;. Almond performed for the event at the Royal Albert Hall.

In 2008 and 2009, Almond toured with Jools Holland throughout the UK as well as guesting at shows by Current 93, Baby Dee and a tribute show to the late folk singer Sandy Denny at the Festival Hall. In October 2009, Almond released his second album of Russian romances and gypsy songs entitled &quot;Orpheus in Exile&quot;. The album was a tribute to gay Russian singer Vadim Kozin, who was exiled to the gulags of the Arctic Circle. The album was produced by Alexei Fedorov and features an orchestra arranged by Anatole Sobolev.

===2010s===
In June 2010, Almond released &quot;Varieté&quot;, his first studio album of self written material since &quot;Stranger Things&quot; in 2001. The album marks Almond&#x27;s 30th anniversary as a recording artist, a fact he celebrated with a new concert tour in Autumn 2010. Also in the summer of 2010 Almond was named Mojo Hero, an award given by the music magazine Mojo. The award was presented to Almond by Anohni who flew from New York for the occasion.

In 2011, Almond released the &quot;Feasting with Panthers&quot; album, a collaboration with musician and arranger Michael Cashmore. It featured poetry set to music, including works by Count Eric Stenbock, Jean Genet, Jean Cocteau, Paul Verlaine and Rimbaud. Later in the same year Almond took part in a music-theatre work &quot;Ten Plagues&quot;, held at Edinburgh&#x27;s Traverse Theatre, as part of the 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, from 1 to 28 August 2011. &quot;Ten Plagues&quot; is a one-man song cycle based on Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Journal of the Plague Year&quot; (which dates back to 1722), with metaphors of AIDS and epidemics. It was written for him by Mark Ravenhill and Conor Mitchell. &quot;Ten Plagues&quot; was awarded a Fringe First Award.

In 2012, Almond took the role of the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca in the Paris Théâtre du Châtelet&#x27;s experimental rock adaptation of &quot;Poppea&quot;, based on Monteverdi&#x27;s original 17th-century opera &quot;The Coronation of Poppea&quot;. The production also featured ex-Libertines member Carl Barât, French singer-songwriter Benjamin Biolay, Swedish singer Fredrika Stahl and was directed by ex-Clash drummer Peter Howard. Later that year, on 9 August 2012, Almond performed at Anohni&#x27;s Meltdown Festival in London&#x27;s Southbank Centre, reforming Marc and the Mambas to perform their second album &quot;Torment and Toreros&quot; live for the first time. Anohni has stated that &quot;Torment and Toreros&quot; was her favourite album throughout her teens and that it became the starting point for Anohni and the Johnsons. Anohni joined the band on stage for one song, singing &quot;My Little Book of Sorrows&quot; with Almond.

In 2013, Almond revived &quot;Ten Plagues&quot; and performed it for a month at Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall in London. He also performed with Jethro Tull&#x27;s Ian Anderson on stage performing Tull&#x27;s concept album &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; at The Royal Albert Hall. That year Almond also received The Ivor Novello Inspiration Award which was presented to him by longtime friend and co-Manager Vicki Wickham, and was also awarded the Icon Award from &quot;Attitude&quot;.

Almond released three albums throughout 2014. First was &quot;The Tyburn Tree&quot; with composer John Harle, a concept album about dark historical London. This was followed by &quot;The Dancing Marquis&quot; album, made with a number of collaborators including Jarvis Cocker, Carl Barât and Jools Holland, featuring production from Tony Visconti on some tracks. Finally, Almond released a studio recording of his 2011 show, &quot;Ten Plagues – A Song Cycle&quot;.

In 2014 Almond was awarded a fellowship from Leeds College Of Music and performed several concerts with the colleges Contemporary Orchestra And Pop Choir.

2015 saw the release of &quot;The Velvet Trail&quot;, an album of original material co-written and produced by Chris Braide. Almond also worked on a song cycle to accompany the filming of a multi media performance of &quot;À rebours&quot; (translated as &quot;Against Nature&quot;) by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The score for this project was written by Othon Mataragas with words from &quot;Feasting with Panthers&quot; collaborator Jeremy Reed. Reed states that he wrote 15 songs for the project commenting that &quot;Against Nature&quot; is &quot;still probably one of the most decadent books ever written&quot; and that Almond had always wanted to perform it, stating that &quot;now we&#x27;re both jaded aesthetes we could do it&quot;.

In 2016, Almond landed his first major label deal in 20 years, signing a two-album deal with BMG Rights Management. In 2017, the compilation album &quot;Hits and Pieces / The Best of Soft Cell &amp; Marc Almond&quot;, debuted at number seven in the UK album chart. In September 2017 the album &quot;Shadows &amp; Reflections&quot; was released, entering the UK chart at No.14.

In 2017 Almond was presented with an honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Lancashire&#x27;s Edgehill University, and delivered that year&#x27;s graduation address.

In September 2018 Soft Cell played the O2 Arena in London celebrating the band&#x27;s 40-year career.

=== 2020s ===
Almond&#x27;s next solo album, &quot;Chaos and a Dancing Star&quot;, also written with Braide, was recorded in Los Angeles and released in January 2020. Ian Anderson played flute on the album. During COVID-19 lockdowns, Almond and David Ball wrote a new Soft Cell album, &quot;Happiness Not Included&quot;, which was released on 6 May 2022. The album contained 12 new tracks, including a collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys on the track &quot;Purple Zone&quot;, which reached number one in the Official Physical Singles Chart and also the Official Vinyl Singles Chart.

In early 2022, Almond supported Ukraine and released an English-language cover of the Ukrainian folk song, &quot;What A Moonlit Night&quot;.

==Personal life==
Almond formerly divided his time among London, Moscow and Barcelona. He stopped living in Moscow following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating in a 2024 interview &quot;I don&#x27;t think I can see myself ever going back to Moscow now. I think as an Englishman, and as an openly gay man, I&#x27;d just be too scared.&quot; In the same interview, it was mentioned that he had recently bought a small farm in Portugal.

Almond has stated that he dislikes being pigeon-holed as &quot;a &#x27;gay&#x27; artist&quot;, saying that such a label &quot;enables people to marginalise your work and reduce its importance, implying that it won&#x27;t be of any interest to anyone who isn&#x27;t gay&quot;.

In his autobiography, Almond describes being invited for initiation into Anton LaVey&#x27;s Church of Satan, and that &quot;not being one to turn down a theatrical moment and a chance to be relegated to the bad book, I immediately said yes.&quot; Noise musician Boyd Rice performed the simple ceremony in &quot;a small grotto in a wood&quot; owned by Rose McDowall close to where the Hellfire Club used to meet. Almond states that the ceremony involved &quot;no dancing naked, no bonfires, no blood sacrifice&quot;, but even so &quot;every hair on my neck stood on end and sweat broke out on my top lip.&quot; Almond later stated in a 2016 interview with &quot;Loud and Quiet&quot; that the initiation was &quot;a theatrical joke that got a bit out of hand&quot; and that he is not a Satanist. By 2020, Almond had converted to Druidism.

In response to being appointed OBE at the age of 60, Almond said he is still a &quot;little bit&quot; anti-establishment, but added: &quot;I can&#x27;t really be a rebel any more. I think it&#x27;s time to leave it to younger people.&quot;

In his 1999 autobiography, Almond stated that he has Meniére Syndrome, which has repercussions on his hearing.

<doc id="287870" wikidata="Q715169" url="?curid=287870" title="George Buchanan">
<text>George Buchanan (; February 1506 – 28 September 1582) was a Scottish historian and humanist scholar. According to historian Keith Brown, Buchanan was &quot;the most profound intellectual sixteenth century Scotland produced.&quot; His ideology of resistance to royal usurpation gained widespread acceptance during the Scottish Reformation. Brown says the ease with which King James VII was deposed in 1689 shows the power of Buchananite ideas.
His treatise &quot;De Jure Regni apud Scotos&quot;, published in 1579, discussed the doctrine that the source of all political power is the people, and that the king is bound by those conditions under which the supreme power was first committed to his hands, and that it is lawful to resist, even to punish, tyrants. 
The importance of Buchanan&#x27;s writings is shown by the suppression of his work by James VI and the British legislatures in the century following their publication. It was condemned by act of parliament in 1584, and burned by the University of Oxford in 1664 and 1683.

==Early life==
===Early upbringing and education in Paris===
His father, a Highlander and a younger son of the old Buchanan family of Drumakill, owned the farm of Moss, in the parish of Killearn, Stirlingshire, but he died young, leaving his widow, five sons, and three daughters in poverty. George&#x27;s mother, Agnes Heriot, was of the family of the Heriots of Trabroun, East Lothian, of which George Heriot, founder of Heriot&#x27;s Hospital, was also a member. Buchanan, a native speaker of Scottish Gaelic, is said to have attended Killearn school, but not much is known of his early education. His brother, Patrick Buchanan, was also a scholar. 

In 1520, he was sent by his uncle, James Heriot, to the University of Paris, where he first came in contact with the two great influences of the age, the Renaissance and the Reformation. There, according to him, he devoted himself to the writing of verses &quot;partly by liking, partly by compulsion (that being then the one task prescribed to youth)&quot;.

===Return to Scotland===
In 1522 his uncle died, and George Buchanan, who was at that time severely ill, was unable to stay in Paris and returned to Scotland. After recovering from his illness, he joined the French auxiliaries who had been brought over to Scotland by John Stewart, Duke of Albany, and took part in an unsuccessful siege of Wark Castle on the border with England in late 1523. In the following year he entered the University of St Andrews, where he graduated B.A. in 1525. He had gone there mainly to attend the lectures of John Mair on logic; and when Mair moved to Paris, Buchanan followed him in 1526.

===Professor and Procurator===
In 1528 Buchanan graduated M.A. at Scots College, University of Paris. The next year he was appointed regent, or professor, in the College of Sainte-Barbe, and taught there for over three years. Sainte-Barbe was one of the most prestigious and advanced colleges at that time. George added to that prestige by creating new reforms in teaching Latin. In 1529 he was elected &quot;Procurator of the German Nation&quot; in the University of Paris, and was re-elected four times in four successive months. He resigned his regentship in 1531, and in 1532 became tutor to Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis, with whom he returned to Scotland early in 1537 having acquired a great reputation for learning.

===Theological stance===
At this period Buchanan assumed the same attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church as Erasmus: he did not repudiate its doctrines, but considered himself free to criticise its practice. Though he listened to the arguments of the Protestant Reformers, he did not join their ranks until 1553. His first literary production in Scotland, when he was in Lord Cassilis&#x27;s household in the west country, was the poem &quot;Somnium&quot;, a satirical attack on the Franciscan friars and the monastic life generally. This assault on the monks was not displeasing to James V, who engaged Buchanan as tutor to one of his natural sons, James Stewart (not the son who was afterwards regent), and encouraged him in a more daring effort. The poems &quot;Palinodia&quot; and &quot;Franciscanus et Fratres&quot; remained unpublished for many years, but made the author hated by the Franciscan order.

==Humanist in exile==

===Arrest, escape and relocation===
In 1539 there was persecution in Scotland of the Lutherans, and Buchanan among others was arrested. Although the King had withheld his protection, Buchanan managed to escape and made his way to London, and then Paris. In Paris, however, he found himself in danger when his main enemy, Cardinal David Beaton, arrived there as ambassador, and on the invitation of André de Gouveia, he moved to Bordeaux. Gouveia was then principal of the newly founded College of Guienne, and by his influence Buchanan was appointed professor of Latin. During his time there several of his major works, the translations of &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Alcestis&quot;, and the two dramas, &quot;Jephthes, sive Votum&quot; and &quot;Baptistes (sive Calumnia)&quot;, were completed.

Michel de Montaigne was Buchanan&#x27;s pupil at Bordeaux and acted in his tragedies. In the essay &quot;Of Presumption&quot; he classes Buchanan with Jean d&#x27;Aurat, Theodore Beza, Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital, Pierre deMontdoré and Adrianus Turnebus, as one of the foremost Latin poets of his time. Here also Buchanan formed a lasting friendship with Julius Caesar Scaliger; in later life he won the admiration of Joseph Scaliger, who wrote an epigram on Buchanan which contains the couplet, famous in its day: &quot;Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia limes; Romani eloquii Scotia limes erit?&quot; Austin Seal and Steve Philp translate this as: &#x27;Just as Scotland was at the apex of the Roman Empire, so Scotland shall be at the apex of Roman eloquence&#x27;. (Not only is Buchanan&#x27;s Latin scholarship extolled, a congratulatory reference to Scotland retaining Scottish law – quintessentially an improved version of Roman law – as the foundation of its legal system is also implied.)

===Return to Paris===
In 1542 or 1543 he returned to Paris, and in 1544 he was appointed regent in the Collège du cardinal Lemoine. Among his colleagues were Muretus and Turnebus. Although little is known about George during this time, we can gather that he probably once again fell ill according to an elegy he wrote to his comrades Tastaeus and Tevius.

===Coimbra===
In 1547 Buchanan joined the band of French and Portuguese humanists who had been invited by Gouveia to lecture in the Portuguese University of Coimbra. The French mathematician Elie Vinet, and the Portuguese historian, Jerónimo Osório, were among his colleagues; Gouveia, called by Montaigne &quot;le plus grand principal de France&quot;, was rector of the university, which had reached the summit of its prosperity under the patronage of King John III. But the rectorship had been coveted by Diogo de Gouveia, uncle of André and formerly head of Sainte-Barbe. It is probable that before André&#x27;s death at the end of 1547 Diogo had urged the Inquisition to investigate him and his staff; up to 1906, when the records of the trial were first published in full, Buchanan&#x27;s biographers generally attributed the attack to the influence of Cardinal Beaton, the Franciscans, or the Jesuits, and the whole history of Buchanan&#x27;s residence in Portugal was extremely obscure.

===Trial and imprisonment===

A commission of inquiry was appointed in October 1549 and reported in June 1550. Buchanan and two Portuguese, Diogo de Teive and João da Costa (who had succeeded to the rectorship), were committed for trial. Teive and Costa were found guilty of various offences against public order, and the evidence shows that there was ample reason for a judicial inquiry. Buchanan was accused of Lutheran and Judaistic practices. He defended himself, admitting that some of the charges were true. About June 1551 he was sentenced to abjure his errors, and to be imprisoned in the monastery of São Bento in Lisbon. Here he listened to edifying discourses from the monks, whom he found &quot;not unkind but ignorant&quot;. In his leisure he began to translate the &quot;Psalms&quot; into Latin verse, completing the greater part of the work.

===Release===
After seven months, Buchanan was released on condition that he remain in Lisbon; and on 28 February 1552 this restriction was lifted. Buchanan then sailed for England, but soon made his way to Paris, where in 1553 he was appointed regent in the College of Boncourt. He remained in that post for two years, and then accepted the office of tutor to the son of the Maréchal de Brissac. It was almost certainly during this last stay in France, where Protestantism was being repressed under King Henry II and his son Francis II, that Buchanan took the side of Calvinism.

==Return to Scotland==
===Espousal of Calvinism===
George Buchanan returned to Scotland in 1560 or 1561. According to the English diplomat Thomas Randolph, in April 1562 Mary, Queen of Scots read Livy with him daily. She gave him a pension of £250 Scots yearly, and an income from the lands of Crossraguel Abbey. Buchanan wrote masques for performance at her wedding to Lord Darnley, known as the &quot;Pompae&quot;. Buchanan, throughout his support for Renaissance humanism and his strident criticism the vices of them, had always remained a member of the Catholic Church in Scotland, but he now openly joined the Protestant Reformed Church. Even though he had recently received from the Queen the gift of the revenues of Crossraguel Abbey, he sat in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1563 and in 1566 was appointed principal of St Leonard&#x27;s College, St Andrews, by the Prince Regent, Earl of Moray. Though a layman, he was made Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1567. He was the last lay person to be elected Moderator until Alison Elliot in 2004, the first female Moderator.

===Tutor and other offices===
Buchanan accompanied the Regent Moray to England, and his famous &quot;Detectio Mariæ Reginæ&quot;—a scathing exposure of the Queen&#x27;s relations to Darnley and the circumstances leading up to his death, published London: John Day, [1571]—was produced to the commissioners at Westminster.

In 1570, after the assassination of Moray, he was appointed one of the preceptors of the young king, and it was through his strict tuition that James VI acquired his scholarship. As the young king&#x27;s senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning. Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his treatise &quot;De Jure Regni apud Scotos&quot;.

While royal tutor he also held other offices: he was for a short time director of chancery, and then became Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, a post which entitled him to a seat in the parliament. He appears to have continued in this office for some years, at least until 1579. John Geddie was his clerk and servant in this role, and copied some of Buchanan&#x27;s manuscripts.

===Final years===
His last years were occupied with completion and publication of two of his major works, &quot;De Jure Regni apud Scotos&quot; (1579) and &quot;Rerum Scoticarum Historia&quot; (1582).

He died in his first floor flat on Kennedy&#x27;s Close (destroyed to build the Tron Kirk in 1637 which was in turn curtailed by the building of modern Hunter Square) in Edinburgh on Friday 28 September 1582 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard on the following day. The grave was originally marked by a &quot;through-stone&quot; but this had sunk into the ground by 1701. Currently, two memorials in Greyfriars each claim to mark his burial: one just north-west of the church and a second, more modest memorial near the eastmost path. The smaller (later) one is correct.

==Works==

===Latin scholar===
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;For mastery of the Latin language, Buchanan has seldom been surpassed by any modern writer. His style is not rigidly modelled on that of any classical author, but has a freshness and elasticity of its own. He wrote Latin as if it were his mother tongue.&quot; Hugh Trevor-Roper called him &quot;by universal consent, the greatest Latin writer, whether in prose or in verse, in sixteenth century Europe&quot;. Buchanan also had a rich vein of poetical feeling, and much originality of thought. His translations of the &quot;Psalms&quot; and of the Greek plays are more than mere versions; his two tragedies, &quot;Baptistes&quot; and &quot;Jephthes&quot;, enjoyed a European reputation for academic excellence. His &quot;Pompae&quot; verses were written for performance at the court entertainments of Mary, including the &quot;Offering of the Rustic Gods&quot; sung during a masque devised by Bastian Pagez for the baptism of King James.

===Prose works===
In addition to these works, Buchanan wrote in prose &quot;Chamaeleon&quot;, a satire in Scots against Maitland of Lethington, first printed in 1711; a Latin translation of Linacre&#x27;s &quot;Grammar&quot; (Paris, 1533); &quot;Libellus de Prosodia&quot; (Edinburgh, 1640); and &quot;Vita ab ipso scripta biennio ante mortem&quot; (1608), edited by R. Sibbald (1702). His other poems are &quot;Fratres Fraterrimi&quot;, &quot;Elegiae&quot;, &quot;Silvae&quot;, two sets of verses entitled &quot;Hendecasyllabon Liber&quot; and &quot;Iambon Liber&quot;; three books of &quot;Epigrammata&quot;; a book of miscellaneous verse; &quot;De Sphaera&quot; (in five books), suggested by the poem &quot;De sphaera mundi&quot; of Joannes de Sacrobosco, and intended as a defence of the Ptolemaic theory against the new Copernican view.

There are two early editions of Buchanan&#x27;s works: Thomas Ruddiman&#x27;s and Pieter Burman&#x27;s.

===Late works===
The first of his important late works was the treatise &quot;De Jure Regni apud Scotos&quot;, published in 1579. In this famous work, composed in the form of a dialogue, and evidently intended to instil sound political principles into the mind of his pupil, Buchanan lays down the doctrine that the source of all political power is the people, that the king is bound by those conditions under which the supreme power was first committed to his hands, and that it is lawful to resist, even to punish, tyrants. The importance of the work is proved by the persistent efforts of the legislature to suppress it during the century following its publication. It was condemned by act of parliament in 1584, and again in 1664; and in 1683 it was burned by the University of Oxford.

The second of his larger works is the &quot;History of Scotland&quot;, &quot;Rerum Scoticarum Historia&quot;, completed shortly before his death, and published in 1582. It is remarkable for the power and richness of its style, and of great value for the period personally known to the author, which occupies the greater portion of the book. The earlier part is based, to a considerable extent, on the legendary history of Boece. Buchanan&#x27;s purpose was to &quot;purge&quot; the national history &quot;of sum Inglis lyis and Scottis vanite&quot; (Letter to Randolph). He said that it would &quot;content few and displease many&quot;; in fact, its matter gave so much offence that a proclamation was issued calling in all copies of it, as well as of the &quot;De Jure Regni&quot;, that they might be purged of the &quot;offensive and extraordinary matters&quot; which they contained.

===Lasting legacy===
Buchanan holds his great and unique place in literature not so much for his own writings as for his strong and lasting influence on subsequent writers. His influence was notable by 1726 when Andrew Millar, a prominent 18th-century bookseller, took over James McEuen&#x27;s bookshop in London at the sign of &#x27;Buchanan&#x27;s Head, Temple Bar&#x27;. The sign for the shop depicted the face of George Buchanan, a testament to Buchanan&#x27;s early place and reputation in Scottish letters. The island of Mainland, Orkney is sometimes referred to as &quot;Pomona&quot; (or &quot;Pomonia&quot;) from an attempted translation by Buchanan, though that name has rarely been used locally.

==Modern publications and influence==
Polygon Books have published the poet Robert Crawford&#x27;s selection of Buchanan&#x27;s verse in &quot;Apollos of the North: Selected Poems of George Buchanan and Arthur Johnston&quot; () in 2006, the 500th anniversary of Buchanan&#x27;s birth.

In the lead-up to the anniversary Professor Roger Mason of the University of St Andrews has published &quot;A Dialogue on the Law of Kingship among the Scots, a critical edition and translation of George Buchanan&#x27;s &#x27;De Iure Regni apud Scotos Dialogus&quot; ().

==Memorials==

A statue of Buchanan stands on the west-facing side of the Scott Monument on Princes Street, Edinburgh. It was sculpted by John Rhind.

A memorial stained glass window stands in the south wall of Greyfriars Kirk.

A bust of Buchanan is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.

A monument was erected by public subscription in 1789 in the place of his birth, Killearn, Stirlingshire. It is attributed to the architect James Craig.

<doc id="287872" wikidata="Q152263" url="?curid=287872" title="Flash mob">
<text>A flash mob (or flashmob) is a group of people that assembles suddenly in a public place, performs for a brief time, then quickly disperses, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, and/or artistic expression. Flash mobs may be organized via telecommunications, social media, or viral emails.

The term, coined in 2003, is generally not applied to events and performances organized for the purposes of politics (such as protests), commercial advertisement, publicity stunts that involve public relation firms, or paid professionals. In these cases of a planned purpose for the social activity in question, the term smart mobs is often applied instead.

The term &quot;flash rob&quot; or &quot;flash mob robberies&quot;, a reference to the way flash mobs assemble, has been used to describe a number of robberies and assaults perpetrated suddenly by groups of teenage youth. Bill Wasik, originator of the first flash mobs, and a number of other commentators have questioned or objected to the usage of &quot;flash mob&quot; to describe criminal acts. Flash mobs have also been featured in some Hollywood movie series, such as &quot;Step Up&quot;.

==History==
===First flash mob===
The first flash mobs were created in Manhattan in 2003, by Bill Wasik, senior editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The first attempt was unsuccessful after the targeted retail store was tipped off about the plan for people to gather. Wasik avoided such problems during the first successful flash mob, which occurred on June 17, 2003, at Macy&#x27;s department store, by sending participants to preliminary staging areas—in four Manhattan bars—where they received further instructions about the ultimate event and location just before the event began.

More than 130 people converged upon the ninth-floor rug department of the store, gathering around an expensive rug. Anyone approached by a sales assistant was advised to say that the gatherers lived together in a warehouse on the outskirts of New York, that they were shopping for a &quot;love rug&quot;, and that they made all their purchase decisions as a group. Subsequently, 200 people flooded the lobby and mezzanine of the Hyatt hotel in synchronized applause for about 15 seconds, and a shoe boutique in SoHo was invaded by participants pretending to be tourists on a bus trip.

Wasik claimed that he created flash mobs as a social experiment designed to poke fun at hippies and to highlight the cultural atmosphere of conformity and of wanting to be an insider or part of &quot;the next big thing&quot;. &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; wrote, &quot;It may have backfired on him ... [Wasik] may instead have ended up giving conformity a vehicle that allowed it to appear nonconforming.&quot; In another interview he said &quot;the mobs started as a kind of playful social experiment meant to encourage spontaneity and big gatherings to temporarily take over commercial and public areas simply to show that they could&quot;.

===Precedents and precursors===
In 19th-century Tasmania, the term &quot;flash mob&quot; was used to describe a subculture consisting of female prisoners, based on the term &quot;flash language&quot; for the jargon that these women used. The 19th-century Australian term &quot;flash mob&quot; referred to a segment of society, not an event, and showed no other similarities to the modern term &quot;flash mob&quot; or the events it describes.

In 1973, the story &quot;Flash Crowd&quot; by Larry Niven described a concept similar to flash mobs. With the invention of popular and very inexpensive teleportation, an argument at a shopping mall—which happens to be covered by a news crew—quickly swells into a riot. In the story, broadcast coverage attracts the attention of other people, who use the widely available technology of the teleportation booth to swarm first that event—thus intensifying the riot—and then other events as they happen. Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, &quot;We call them flash crowds, and we watch for them.&quot; In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place. Lev Grossman suggests that the story title is a source of the term &quot;flash mob&quot;.
Flash mobs began as a form of performance art. While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political demonstrations. In the 1960s, groups such as the Yippies used street theatre to expose the public to political issues. Flash mobs can be seen as a specialized form of smart mob, a term and concept proposed by author Howard Rheingold in his 2002 book &quot;Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution&quot;.

==Use of the term==
The first documented use of the term &quot;flash mob&quot; as it is understood today was in 2003 in a blog entry posted in the aftermath of Wasik&#x27;s event. The term was inspired by the earlier term &quot;smart mob&quot;.

Flash mob was added to the 11th edition of the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot; on July 8, 2004, where it noted it as an &quot;unusual and pointless act&quot; separating it from other forms of smart mobs such as types of performance, protests, and other gatherings. Also recognized noun derivatives are flash mobber and flash mobbing. &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Millennium Dictionary of English&quot; defines &quot;flash mob&quot; as &quot;a group of people who organize on the Internet and then quickly assemble in a public place, do something bizarre, and disperse.&quot; This definition is consistent with the original use of the term; however, both news media and promoters have subsequently used the term to refer to any form of smart mob, including political protests; a collaborative Internet denial of service attack; a collaborative supercomputing demonstration; and promotional appearances by pop musicians. The press has also used the term &quot;flash mob&quot; to refer to a practice in China where groups of shoppers arrange online to meet at a store in order to drive a collective bargain.

== Legality ==
The city of Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany, has stopped flash mobs by strictly enforcing the already existing law of requiring a permit to use any public space for an event. In the United Kingdom, a number of flash mobs have been stopped over concerns for public health and safety. The British Transport Police have urged flash mob organizers to &quot;refrain from holding such events at railway stations&quot;.

==Crime==

Referred to as &quot;flash robs&quot;, &quot;flash mob robberies&quot;, or &quot;flash robberies&quot; by the media, crimes organized by teenage youth using social media rose to international notoriety beginning in 2011. The National Retail Federation does not classify these crimes as &quot;flash mobs&quot; but rather &quot;multiple offender crimes&quot; that utilize &quot;flash mob tactics&quot;. In a report, the NRF noted, &quot;multiple offender crimes tend to involve groups or gangs of juveniles who already know each other, which does not earn them the term &#x27;flash mob&#x27;.&quot; Mark Leary, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, said that most &quot;flash mob thuggery&quot; involves crimes of violence that are otherwise ordinary, but are perpetrated suddenly by large, organized groups of people: &quot;What social media adds is the ability to recruit such a large group of people, that individuals who would not rob a store or riot on their own feel freer to misbehave without being identified.&quot;

&quot;HuffPost&quot; raised the question asking if &quot;the media was responsible for stirring things up&quot;, and added that in some cases the local authorities did not confirm the use of social media making the &quot;use of the term flash mob questionable&quot;. Amanda Walgrove wrote that criminals involved in such activities do not refer to themselves as &quot;flash mobs&quot;, but that this use of the term is nonetheless appropriate. Dr. Linda Kiltz drew similar parallels between flash robs and the Occupy Movement stating, &quot;As the use of social media increases, the potential for more flash mobs that are used for political protest and for criminal purposes is likely to increase.&quot;.

<text>The SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; (Official Number 224850) is a retired Great Lakes bulk freighter now restored as a museum ship in Cleveland, Ohio, one of five in the Great Lakes region. She transported cargo such as ore, coal, stone, and grain to ports throughout the Great Lakes, and was nicknamed &quot;The Ship That Built Cleveland&quot; because Cleveland&#x27;s steel mills were a frequent destination.

==History==
It was built in 1925 by Great Lakes Engineering Works, Ecorse, Michigan, as the flagship for Cleveland-Cliffs and was named in honor of the then-company president, William Gwinn Mather. SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; remained the Cliffs&#x27; flagship until SS &quot;Edward B. Greene&quot; (now MV &quot;Kaye E. Barker&quot; of the Interlake Steamship Company fleet) was built in 1951–52. It remained an active part of the Cliffs&#x27; fleet until the end of the 1980 navigation season.

In order to supply the Allied Forces need for steel during World War II, SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; led a convoy of 13 freighters in early 1941 through the ice-choked Upper Great Lakes to Duluth, Minnesota, setting a record for the first arrival in a northern port. This effort was featured in the April 28, 1941 issue of &quot;Life&quot;. It was one of the first commercial Great Lakes vessels to be equipped with radar in 1946. In 1964, it became the very first American vessel to have an automated boiler system, manufactured by Bailey Controls of Cleveland, Ohio.

In 1985, Cleveland-Cliffs sold its two remaining operating steamers to Rouge Steel Company, and gradually sold off its idle vessels until only SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; remained, laid up in Toledo, Ohio where she had been since 1980. On December 10, 1987, Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. donated the steamer SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; to the Great Lakes Historical Society to be restored and preserved as a museum ship and floating maritime museum. After it was brought to Cleveland in October 1988 and funding was acquired from local foundations, corporations, and individuals, restoration began. Fire damage to SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot;″s galley and after cabin spaces required a major restoration effort. All over the vessel, most of the work was supplied by volunteers who repaired, cleaned, chipped, painted, and polished brass in order to restore SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot;″s former elegance. In October 1990, it was moved to its permanent berth at the East Ninth Street Pier on Cleveland&#x27;s North Coast Harbor.

In September 1994 the Great Lakes Historical Society divested itself of the museum. Due, in large part, to a groundswell of local support to keep the Mather in Cleveland, the Harbor Heritage Society was created to negotiate a new lease agreement with the city. Incorporated in June 1995, Harbor Heritage formally acquired SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; on July 22, 1995, and in 1996 continued to oversee SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot;″s ongoing restoration, promotion, and development as a historic vessel. After ten years of negotiations, the City of Cleveland, represented by Mayor Jane L. Campbell signed a 40-year lease on June 15, 2003, allowing SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; to stay at its East 9th Street berth.

On July 30, 1995 the steamship SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; was dedicated as an American Society of Mechanical Engineers National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark for its 1954 installation of a single marine boiler and steam turbine engine, its 1964 installation of the Bailey 760 Boiler Control System and American Shipbuilding AmThrust dual propeller bow thruster—all firsts for U.S.-flagged Great Lakes vessels. It had a sister ship of the same class, SS &quot;Joseph H. Frantz&quot;, which was later converted to diesel, and was scrapped in 2005 after 80 years of continuous use.

==Current location==
On September 24, 2005, the museum was moved from the East Ninth Street Pier to Dock 32, just west of the East Ninth Street Pier, closer to the Great Lakes Science Center and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In October 2006, SS &quot;William G. Mather&quot; was acquired by the Great Lakes Science Center. Today, the ship is a focal point for interpreting the relationship between technology, history, commerce, and the environment.

<text>George Buchanan (30 November 1890 – 28 June 1955) was a Scottish patternmaker, trade union activist and Member of Parliament.

Buchanan was born in Glasgow, Scotland. A committed socialist, he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP).

Buchanan was vice-chairman of Glasgow Trades Council and sat on the City Council from 1919 to 1923. At the 1922 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Gorbals.

Buchanan supported Home Rule for Scotland and he was associated with the Scottish Home Rule Association. In 1924 he introduced a Scottish Home Rule Bill but despite support from Scottish MPs it was talked out by the Opposition.

In 1932, Buchanan became Chairman of the United Patternmakers Association of Great Britain, which he held for 16 years. He initially agreed with James Maxton&#x27;s moving the ILP out of the mainstream Labour Party but decided to leave it to rejoin Labour in 1939.

At the 1945 general election, Buchanan retained the seat of Glasgow Gorbals and attained the largest increase in percentage of voters in recorded UK history. After the election, the new prime minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Buchanan as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. Buchanan also later served as Minister of Pensions.

Buchanan resigned from Parliament in 1948 to take up the position of Chairman of the National Assistance Board and was succeeded by Alice Cullen, who had already succeeded him as the candidate for Glasgow Gorbals.

He died in 1955, at 64.

<doc id="287880" wikidata="Q585374" url="?curid=287880" title="XHTML Basic">
<text>XHTML Basic is an XML-based structured markup language primarily designed for simple (mainly &quot;handheld&quot;) user agents, often found in mobile devices such as mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and set-top boxes..

XHTML Basic is a subset of XHTML 1.1, defined using XHTML Modularization including a reduced set of modules for document structure, images, forms, basic tables, and object support. XHTML Basic is suitable for mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and settop boxes.

XHTML Basic was once intended to replace older technologies like WML and C-HTML as more compliant user agents were developed. However, with the rise of [[HTML5]] as the dominant web standard, XHTML Basic has been largely supplanted. HTML5&#x27;s rich feature set and cross-device compatibility have rendered separate mobile-specific languages like WML, C-HTML, and XHTML Basic unnecessary. Today, HTML5 provides a unified platform for creating websites that work across all devices, making XHTML Basic largely irrelevant in modern web development.

One significant advantage of XHTML Basic over WML and C-HTML is that XHTML Basic pages can be rendered differently in web browsers and on handheld devices, eliminating the need for creating two different versions of the same page.

The initial specification for XHTML Basic was released in 2000. In 2006, the specification was revised to version 1.1, incorporating six new features to better serve the small-device community. The latest update of the specification by the W3C has been performed in 2018.

== Latest Developments (2018 Update) ==
The 2018 update to XHTML Basic by the W3C focused on improving interoperability with current technologies, ensuring XHTML Basic pages remain usable across a broader range of modern devices, including those that have adopted more recent web standards. These changes aimed to refine how XHTML Basic interacts with modern networking environments, enhancing compatibility with newer handheld devices and browsers that now more frequently rely on HTML5.

While XHTML Basic remains functional, it is considered outdated in comparison to modern HTML5, which has become the dominant standard for mobile-first design. HTML5 includes features for multimedia, graphics, and responsive layouts, making it far more versatile for current web development needs.

==DOCTYPE==
To validate as XHTML Basic, a document must contain the following Document Type Declaration, or DOCTYPE:
:codice_1

A complete valid and well-formed example is:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.1//EN&quot;
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic11.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=&quot;http://example.org/&quot;&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Served with a MIME type of &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;.

==XHTML-Print==
XHTML-Print, which became a W3C Recommendation in September 2006, is a specialized version of XHTML Basic designed for documents printed from information appliances to low-end printers.

<doc id="287881" wikidata="Q7985727" url="?curid=287881" title="West Lebanon, New Hampshire">
<text>West Lebanon is an area within the city of Lebanon in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States, along the Connecticut River. The ZIP Code area for the community had a population of 4,444 at the 2020 census, out of 14,282 in the entire city. West Lebanon contains a major commercial strip along New Hampshire Route 12A, serving the Upper Valley communities along Interstates 89 and 91. It also hosts the Lebanon Municipal Airport, a number of small software and tech businesses, and a regional daily newspaper, the &quot;Valley News&quot;. The village serves as a bedroom community for nearby Dartmouth College.

West Lebanon was the site of Lebanon&#x27;s first settlement in 1761. The village later developed into a regional hub for rail transport, although at that time it was better known to travelers as Westboro. By the 1950s, however, the rail industry had shrunk significantly. The rail service through West Lebanon was eventually terminated, and the village of White River Junction, Vermont, across the Connecticut River, took over most of the remaining services.

Today commerce has replaced transportation as the basis of the economy, and West Lebanon serves as the commercial hub for a U.S. micropolitan area (the Lebanon–Claremont micropolitan area) of over 220,000 people.

<doc id="287883" wikidata="Q17090786" url="?curid=287883" title="XHTML Modularization">
<text>XHTML modularization is a methodology for producing modularized markup languages in a number of different schema languages (currently DTDs, XML Schema and Relax NG) so that the modules can easily be plugged together to create markup languages.

Although it was originally designed to help manage the development of various XHTML Profiles, such as XHTML 1.1, XHTML Basic for mobile devices, and XHTML Print for sending to printers,
the methodology is independent of XHTML, and has been used for the definition of other markup languages as well, such as SVG and MathML.

==Method==
XHTML Modularization consists of three essential parts
# a technique or methodology (as explained, actually independent of XHTML, and applicable to any XML-based markup language) for defining abstract modules of a markup language, and implementing those modules in various schema languages, such as DTDs, XML Schema, and Relax NG.
# a collection of abstract modules
# a number of implementations of those modules in various schema languages.

To define a language using these modules, you only have to define a &quot;driver&quot; in one or more of the implementation schema languages, that causes the necessary modules to be loaded.

==Application to XHTML==
In its application to XHTML, it provides a means for defining modules of XHTML to allow subsetting and extending XHTML in a controlled way.

Core modules are:
* Structure (html, head, body, title...)
* Text (h1, h2, h3... p, pre...)
* Hypertext (a)
* List (ul, li...)
Other modules include applet, image, forms and basic forms.

<doc id="287885" wikidata="Q13400765" url="?curid=287885" title="Respiratory tract">
<text>The respiratory tract is the subdivision of the respiratory system involved with the process of conducting air to the alveoli for the purposes of gas exchange in mammals. The respiratory tract is lined with respiratory epithelium as respiratory mucosa.

Air is breathed in through the nose to the nasal cavity, where a layer of nasal mucosa acts as a filter and traps pollutants and other harmful substances found in the air. Next, air moves into the pharynx, a passage that contains the intersection between the oesophagus and the larynx. The opening of the larynx has a special flap of cartilage, the epiglottis, that opens to allow air to pass through but closes to prevent food from moving into the airway.

From the larynx, air moves into the trachea and down to the intersection known as the carina that branches to form the right and left primary (main) bronchi. Each of these bronchi branches into a secondary (lobar) bronchus that branches into tertiary (segmental) bronchi, that branch into smaller airways called bronchioles that eventually connect with tiny specialized structures called alveoli that function in gas exchange.

The lungs which are located in the thoracic cavity, are protected from physical damage by the rib cage. At the base of the lungs is a sheet of skeletal muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm separates the lungs from the stomach and intestines. The diaphragm is also the main muscle of respiration involved in breathing, and is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.
The lungs are encased in a serous membrane that folds in on itself to form the pleurae – a two-layered protective barrier. The inner visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs, and the outer parietal pleura is attached to the inner surface of the thoracic cavity. The pleurae enclose a cavity called the pleural cavity that contains pleural fluid. This fluid is used to decrease the amount of friction that lungs experience during breathing.

== Structure ==

The respiratory tract is divided into the upper airways and lower airways. The upper airways or upper respiratory tract includes the nose and nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, the pharynx, and the portion of the larynx above the vocal folds (cords). The lower airways or lower respiratory tract includes the portion of the larynx below the vocal folds, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. The lungs can be included in the lower respiratory tract or as separate entity and include the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli.

The respiratory tract can also be divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone, based on the distinction of transporting gases or exchanging them.

The conducting zone includes structures outside of the lungs – the nose, pharynx, larynx, and trachea, and structures inside the lungs – the bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles. The conduction zone conducts air breathed in that is filtered, warmed, and moistened, into the lungs. It represents the 1st through the 16th division of the respiratory tract. The conducting zone is most of the respiratory tract that conducts gases into and out of the lungs but excludes the respiratory zone that exchanges gases. The conducting zone also functions to offer a low resistance pathway for airflow. It provides a major defense role in its filtering abilities.

The respiratory zone includes the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli, and is the site of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with the blood. The respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar ducts are responsible for 10% of the gas exchange. The alveoli are responsible for the other 90%. The respiratory zone represents the 16th through the 23rd division of the respiratory tract.

From the bronchi, the dividing tubes become progressively smaller with an estimated 20 to 23 divisions before ending at an alveolus.

===Upper respiratory tract===

The upper respiratory tract can refer to the parts of the respiratory system lying above the vocal folds, or above the cricoid cartilage. The larynx is sometimes included in both the upper and lower airways. The larynx is also called the voice box and has the associated cartilage that produces sound. The tract consists of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, the pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx) and sometimes includes the larynx.

===Lower respiratory tract===

The lower respiratory tract or lower airway is derived from the developing foregut and consists of the trachea, bronchi (primary, secondary and tertiary), bronchioles (including terminal and respiratory), and lungs (including alveoli). It also sometimes includes the larynx. 
The lower respiratory tract is also called the respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree, to describe the branching structure of airways supplying air to the lungs, and includes the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles.

* trachea
** main bronchus (diameter approximately 1 – 1.4 cm in adults)
*** lobar bronchus (diameter approximately 1 cm)
**** segmental bronchus (diameter 4.5 to 13 mm)
***** subsegmental bronchus (diameter 1 to 6 mm)
****** conducting bronchiole
******* terminal bronchiole
******** respiratory bronchiole
********* alveolar duct
********** alveolar sac
*********** alveolus

At each division point or generation, one airway branches into two smaller airways. The human respiratory tree may consist on average of 23 generations, while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13 generations. Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such as the bronchi) mainly function to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions including the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts, and alveoli, are specialized for gas exchange.

The trachea is the largest tube in the respiratory tract and consists of tracheal rings of hyaline cartilage. It branches off into two bronchial tubes, a left and a right main bronchus. The bronchi branch off into smaller sections inside the lungs, called bronchioles. These bronchioles give rise to the air sacs in the lungs called the alveoli.

The lungs are the largest organs in the lower respiratory tract. The lungs are suspended within the pleural cavity of the thorax. The pleurae are two thin membranes, one cell layer thick, which surround the lungs. The inner (visceral pleura) covers the lungs and the outer (parietal pleura) lines the inner surface of the chest wall. This membrane secretes a small amount of fluid, allowing the lungs to move freely within the pleural cavity while expanding and contracting during breathing. The lungs are divided into different lobes. The right lung is larger in size than the left, because of the heart&#x27;s being situated to the left of the midline. The right lung has three lobes – upper, middle, and lower (or superior, middle, and inferior), and the left lung has two – upper and lower (or superior and inferior), plus a small tongue-shaped portion of the upper lobe known as the lingula. Each lobe is further divided up into segments called bronchopulmonary segments. Each lung has a costal surface, which is adjacent to the ribcage; a diaphragmatic surface, which faces downward toward the diaphragm; and a mediastinal surface, which faces toward the center of the chest, and lies against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where the two mainstem bronchi branch off from the base of the trachea.

The alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. The mean number of alveoli in a human lung is 480 million. When the diaphragm contracts, a negative pressure is generated in the thorax and air rushes in to fill the cavity. When that happens, these sacs fill with air, making the lung expand. The alveoli are rich with capillaries, called alveolar capillaries. Here the red blood cells absorb oxygen from the air and then carry it back in the form of oxyhaemaglobin, to nourish the cells. The red blood cells also carry carbon dioxide () away from the cells in the form of carbaminohemoglobin and release it into the alveoli through the alveolar capillaries. When the diaphragm relaxes, a positive pressure is generated in the thorax and air rushes out of the alveoli expelling the carbon dioxide.

===Microanatomy===

The respiratory tract is covered in epithelium, which varies down the tract. There are glands and mucus produced by goblet cells in parts, as well as smooth muscle, elastin or cartilage. The epithelium from the nose to the bronchioles is covered in ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, commonly called respiratory epithelium. The cilia beat in one direction, moving mucus towards the throat where it is swallowed. Moving down the bronchioles, the cells get more cuboidal in shape but are still ciliated.

Glands are abundant in the upper respiratory tract, but there are fewer lower down and they are absent starting at the bronchioles. The same goes for goblet cells, although there are scattered ones in the first bronchioles.

Cartilage is present until the bronchioles. In the trachea, they are C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage, whereas in the bronchi the cartilage takes the form of interspersed plates. Smooth muscle starts in the trachea, where it joins the C-shaped rings of cartilage. It continues down the bronchi and bronchioles, which it completely encircles. Instead of hard cartilage, the bronchi and bronchioles are composed of elastic tissue.

The lungs are made up of thirteen different kinds of cells, eleven types of epithelial cell and two types of mesenchymal cell. The epithelial cells form the lining of the tracheal, and bronchial tubes, while the mesenchymal cells line the lungs.

== Function ==
Most of the respiratory tract exists merely as a piping system for air to travel in the lungs, and alveoli are the only part of the lung that exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood.

===Respiration===

Respiration is the rhythmical process of breathing, in which air is drawn into the alveoli of the lungs via inhalation and subsequently expelled via exhalation. When a human being inhales, air travels down the trachea, through the bronchial tubes, and into the lungs. The entire tract is protected by the rib cage, spine, and sternum. In the lungs, oxygen from the inhaled air is transferred into the blood and circulated throughout the body. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is transferred from returning blood back into gaseous form in the lungs and exhaled through the lower respiratory tract and then the upper, to complete the process of breathing.

Unlike the trachea and bronchi, the upper airway is a collapsible, compliant tube. As such, it has to be able to withstand suction pressures generated by the rhythmic expansion of the thoracic cavity that sucks air into the lungs. This is accomplished by the contraction of upper airway muscles during inhalation, such as the genioglossus (tongue) and the hyoid muscles. In addition to rhythmic innervation from the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata, the motor neurons controlling the muscles also receive tonic innervation that sets a baseline level of stiffness and size.

The diaphragm is the primary muscle that allows for lung expansion and contraction. Smaller muscles between the ribs, the external intercostals, assist with this process.

===Defences against infection===

The epithelial lining of the upper respiratory tract is interspersed with goblet cells that secrete a protective mucus. This helps to filter waste, which is eventually either swallowed into the highly acidic stomach environment or expelled via spitting. The epithelium lining the respiratory tract is covered in small hairs called cilia. These beat rhythmically out from the lungs, moving secreted mucus foreign particles toward the laryngopharynx upwards and outwards, in a process called mucociliary clearance, preventing mucus accumulation in the lungs. Macrophages in the alveoli are part of the immune system which engulf and digest any inhaled harmful agents.

Hair in the nostrils plays a protective role, trapping particulate matter such as dust. These hairs, called vibrissae, are thicker than body hair and effectively block larger particles from entering the respiratory tract. They also increase the surface area for particle deposition, improving the nose&#x27;s ability to filter pathogens. The cough reflex expels all irritants within the mucous membrane to the outside. The airways of the lungs contain rings of muscle. When the passageways are irritated by some allergen, these muscles can constrict.

==Clinical significance==

The respiratory tract is a common site for infections.

=== Infection ===
====Upper respiratory infection====

Upper respiratory tract infections are probably the most common infections in the world.

The respiratory system is very prone to developing infections in the lungs. Infants and older adults are more likely to develop infections in their lungs because their lungs are not as strong in fighting off these infections. Most of these infections used to be fatal, but with new research and medicine, they are now treatable. With bacterial infections, antibiotics are prescribed, while viral infections are harder to treat but still curable.

The common cold, and flu are the most common causes of an upper respiratory tract infection, which can cause more serious illness that can develop in the lower respiratory 
tract.

====Lower respiratory tract infections====

Pneumonia is the most common, and frequent lower respiratory tract infection. This can be either viral, bacterial, or fungal. This infection is very common because pneumonia can be airborne, and when you inhale this infection in the air, the particles enter the lungs and move into the air sacs. This infection quickly develops in the lower part of the lung and fills the lung with fluid, and excess mucus. This causes difficulty in breathing and coughing as the lower respiratory tract tries to get rid of the fluid in the lungs. You can be more prone to developing this infection if you have asthma, flu, heart disease, or cancer

 Bronchitis is another common infection that takes place in the lower respiratory tract. It is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes. There are two forms of this infection: acute bronchitis, which is treatable and can go away without treatment, or chronic bronchitis, which comes and goes, but will always affect one&#x27;s lungs. Bronchitis increases the amount of mucus that is natural in your respiratory tract. Chronic bronchitis is common in smokers, because the tar from smoking accumulates over time, causing the lungs to work harder to repair themselves.

 Tuberculosis is one of many other infections that occurs in the lower respiratory tract. You can contract this infection from airborne droplets, and if inhaled you are at risk of this disease. This is a bacterial infection that deteriorates the lung tissue resulting in coughing up blood. This infection is deadly if not treated.

===Cancer===
Some of these cancers have environmental causes such as smoking. When a tobacco product is inhaled, the smoke paralyzes the cilia, causing mucus to enter the lungs. Frequent smoking, over time, causes the cilia hairs to die and can no longer filter mucus. Tar from the smoke inhaled enters the lungs, turning the pink-coloured lungs black. The accumulation of this tar could eventually lead to lung cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

=== COPD ===

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lower respiratory disease that can be caused by exposure to harmful chemicals, or prolonged use of tobacco. This disease is chronic and progressive, the damage to the lungs is irreversible and eventually fatal. COPD destroys the alveoli, and lung tissue which makes breathing very difficult, causing shortness of breath, hyperventilation, and raised chest. The decreased number of alveoli causes loss of oxygen supply to the lungs and an increased accumulation of carbon dioxide. There are two types of COPD: primary and secondary. Primary COPD can be found in younger adults. This type of COPD deteriorates the air sacs, and lung mass. Secondary COPD can be found in older adults who smoke or have smoked and have a history of bronchitis. COPD includes symptoms of emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

=== Asthma ===
The bronchi are the main passages to the right and left lungs. These airways carry oxygen to the bronchioles inside the lungs. Inflammation of the bronchii and bronchioles can cause them to swell up, which could lead to an asthma attack. This results in wheezing, tightness of the chest, and severe difficulty in breathing. There are different types of asthma that affect the functions of the bronchial tubes. Allergies can also set off an allergic reaction, causing swelling of the bronchial tubes; as a result, the air passage will swell up, or close up completely.

===Mouth breathing===
In general, air is inhaled through the nose. It can be inhaled through the mouth if it is not possible to breathe through the nose. However, chronic mouth breathing can cause a dry mouth and lead to infections.

<doc id="287892" wikidata="Q731050" url="?curid=287892" title="George Buchanan (diplomat)">
<text>Sir George William Buchanan, (25 November 1854 – 20 December 1924) was a British diplomat. Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, he was the youngest son of the diplomat Sir Andrew Buchanan, 1st Baronet and Frances, daughter of the Very Rev Edward Mellish and Elizabeth Leigh.

==Diplomatic career==
Buchanan entered diplomatic service in 1876 and served as Second Secretary in Tokyo, Vienna and Bern and as Secretary in Rome. By 1899, he was serving on the Venezuelan Boundary Commission and later that year was appointed chargé d&#x27;affaires at Darmstadt and Karlsruhe. In late 1901, he moved to Berlin, where he was appointed First Secretary at the British embassy. From 1903 to 1908, he was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Bulgaria, and in 1909, he was appointed as Minister to the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Invested with the Knight&#x27;s Grand Cross of Royal Victorian Order in 1909, he was next sworn to the Privy Council. In 1910, Buchanan was appointed as the British Ambassador to Russia. He kept abreast of the political developments in Russia and met some of the leading liberal reformists in the country.

When the Dardanelles were guaranteed by Germany to the Ottoman Empire, Italy sent two secret documents via the British diplomatic corps from Sir Michael Rodd to Buchanan at St Petersburg. They were the evidence that Russia needed to persuade Italy to support its Serbian policy in the Balkans. On 4 March 1915, Imperiali, the Italian envoy to London, presented the documents to Sir Edward Grey on the 16 February authority from Italian Foreign Minister Sonnino. France attached great importance to Italy&#x27;s decision to join the Allies. Buchanan brought Count Sazonov to the negotiating table.

It has been suggested that to have been secretly encouraged by the then Liberal government in London:

Buchanan had developed a strong bond with Tsar Nicholas II and attempted to convince him that granting some constitutional reform would stave off revolution. Buchanan actively supported the Duma in its efforts to change Russia&#x27;s stately system during wartime. Nicholas&#x27;s opinion of him was under the Tsarina&#x27;s sway. Knowing that there were plots to stage a palace coup to replace him, Buchanan formally requested an audience with the Tsar in the troubled early days of 1917. At his last meeting with Nicholas, Buchanan pleaded with him in &#x27;undiplomatic&#x27; language: &quot;I can but plead as my excuse the fact that I have throughout been inspired by my feelings of devotion for Your Majesty and the Empress. If I were to see a friend walking through a wood on a dark night along a path which I knew ended in a precipice, would it not be my duty, sir, to warn him of his danger? And is it not equally my duty to warn Your Majesty of the abyss that lies ahead of you? You have, sir, come to the parting of the ways, and you have now to choose between two paths. The one will lead you to victory and a glorious peace – the other to revolution and disaster. Let me implore Your Majesty to choose the former.&quot;

Although the Tsar was touched by the Ambassador&#x27;s devotion, he allowed his wife&#x27;s malevolent attitudes to outweigh the sensible advice that he had been given. After the collapse of the autocracy (see Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia), he developed close relations with the liberal Provisional Government, which was led initially by George Lvov and later by Alexander Kerensky and was formed after the February Revolution. At the same time, Buchanan developed a fear of the dangers of Bolshevism and its growing support. He feared that the Russian Provisional Government would be toppled and tried to warn of the fragility of the government and the dangers of a Bolshevik revolution. Buchanan had reported to London: &quot;They are more active and better organized than any other group, and until they and the ideas which they represent are finally squashed, the country will remain a prey to anarchy and disorder. If the Government are not strong enough to put down the Bolsheviks by force, at the risk of breaking altogether with the soviet, the only alternative will be a Bolshevik Government.&quot; However, after the events of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks&#x27; ascension to power, Buchanan was widely criticized for failing to ensure that Tsar and his family were evacuated from Russia before their execution by the Bolsheviks at Ekaterinburg in 1918. It is now known that was not the fault of Buchanan but that of the Tsar&#x27;s first cousin, King George V, who feared revolutionary trends in Britain and the stability of his own throne and so persuaded the Lloyd George government to rescind the offer that had made to provide sanctuary for the Imperial Family.

Buchanan was disappointed that the fledgling democracy offered by the Provisional Government was strangled by the Bolshevik coup.

In early December 1918, Buchanan fell ill and for the good of his health agreed that it was best for him to leave Russia. His family left St Petersburg on 26 December 1918 and arrived back in Leith, in Scotland, on 17 January 1919. His health soon collapsed, which forced him to spend time recovering in Cornwall.

After his recovery, he was disappointed that after all of his years of service, he was not given a peerage and offered only a two-year ambassadorship in Rome. He accepted the post and served as ambassador to the Kingdom of Italy from 1919 to 1921. While in Italy his wife was found to have terminal cancer and died in April 1921, soon after the family&#x27;s return to England.

Buchanan&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Mission to Russia and Other Diplomatic Memories&quot;, was published in 1923. It is believed that he had to leave out some of what he knew for fear of losing his pension. He died in 1924.

<text>A sign language glove is an electronic device which attempts to convert the motions of a sign language into written or spoken words. Some critics of such technologies have argued that the potential of sensor-enabled gloves to do this is commonly overstated or misunderstood, because many sign languages have a complex grammar that includes use of the sign space and facial expressions (non-manual elements).

The wearable device contains sensors that run along the four fingers and thumb to identify each word, phrase or letter as it is made in the given sign language.

Those signals are then sent wirelessly to a smartphone, which translates them into spoken words at a rate of one word per second.

The first working prototype used in the field was developed by an Oxford teacher and Intel engineer named Roy Allele, and it launched at a special needs school in Kenya in 2019.

Scientists at UCLA, where one the many projects was developed, believe the innovation could allow for easier communication for deaf people. &quot;Our hope is that this opens up an easy way for people who use sign language to communicate directly with non-signers without needing someone else to translate for them,&quot; said lead researcher Jun Chen.

The researchers also added adhesive sensors to the faces of people used to test the device—between their eyebrows and on one side of their mouths—to capture nonmanual features of the language.

<text>Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge (Adolphus Frederick; 24 February 1774 – 8 July 1850) was the tenth child and seventh son of King George III of the United Kingdom and Queen Charlotte. He held the title of Duke of Cambridge from 1801 until his death. He served as Viceroy of the Kingdom of Hanover successively on behalf of his elder brothers King George IV and King William IV.

Prince Adolphus married Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel in 1818, by whom he had three children: Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, Princess Augusta of Cambridge and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge.

==Early life==

Prince Adolphus was born in February 1774 at Buckingham House, then known as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s House&quot;, in the City and Liberty of Westminster, now within Greater London. He was the youngest son of King George III and Queen Charlotte to survive childhood.

Adolphus was baptized on 24 March 1774 in the Great Council Chamber at St James&#x27;s Palace by Frederick Cornwallis, Archbishop of Canterbury. His godparents were Prince John Adolphus of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (his great-uncle, for whom the Earl of Hertford, Lord Chamberlain, stood proxy), Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kassel (his first cousin once removed, for whom the Earl of Jersey, Extra Lord of the Bedchamber, stood proxy) and Princess Wilhelmina of Orange (the wife of his first cousin once removed, for whom Elizabeth Howard, Dowager Countess of Effingham, former Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Charlotte, stood proxy).

Adolphus was tutored at home until summer 1786, when he was sent to the University of Göttingen in Germany, along with his brothers Prince Ernest (created Duke of Cumberland in 1799) and Prince Augustus (created Duke of Sussex in 1801).
==Military career==
Adolphus was made honorary Colonel-in-Chief of the Hanoverian Guard Foot Regiment 1789–1803, but his military training began in 1791, when he and Prince Ernest went to Hanover to study under the supervision of the Hanoverian commander Field Marshal Wilhelm von Freytag. He remained on Freytag&#x27;s staff during the Flanders Campaign in 1793. His first taste of action was at Famars on 23 May. He was wounded and captured at the Battle of Hondschoote 6 September, but was quickly rescued. As a Hanoverian General-Major, he commanded a Hessian brigade under his paternal great-uncle, General Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn in Autumn 1794, then commanded the Hanoverian Guards during the retreat through Holland. Remaining in Germany, he commanded a brigade of the Corps of Observation from 22 October 1796 until 12 January 1798. He was made a British Army colonel in 1794, and lieutenant general on 24 August 1798. In 1800 – whilst stationed in the Electorate of Hanover – he attended the founding of a village (part of the settlement of the moorlands north of Bremen), which was named after him: Adolphsdorf (since 1974 a component locality of Grasberg).

During the War of the Second Coalition against France (1799–1802), Adolphus traveled to Berlin in 1801, in order to prevent the impending Prussian occupation of the Electorate. France demanded it, as it was stipulated in the Peace of Basel (1795), obliging Prussia to ensure the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s neutrality in all the latter&#x27;s territories north of the demarcation line at the river Main, including Hanover. Regular Hanoverian troops, therefore, had been commandeered to join the multilateral so-called &quot;Demarcation Army&quot;. His efforts were in vain. In 1803, he was senior army commander, and replaced Wallmoden as commander on the Weser on 1 June. With the advance of French forces on one side and 24,000 Prussian soldiers on the other, the situation was hopeless. Cambridge refused to become involved in discussions of capitulation, handed over his command to Hammerstein (Ompteda claims he was forced to resign), and withdrew to England. A plan to recruit additional soldiers in Hanover to be commanded by the Prince had also failed.

In 1803, Adolphus was appointed as commander-in-chief of the newly founded King&#x27;s German Legion, and in 1813, he became field marshal. George III appointed Prince Adolphus a Knight of the Garter on 2 June 1776, and created him Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Tipperary, and Baron Culloden on 24 November 1801.

The Duke served as colonel-in-chief of the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards (Coldstream Guards after 1855) from September 1805, and as colonel-in-chief of the 60th (The Duke of York&#x27;s Own Rifle Corps) Regiment of Foot from January 1824. After the collapse of Napoleon&#x27;s empire, he was Military Governor of Hanover from 4 November 1813 – 24 October 1816, then Governor General of Hanover from 24 October 1816 – 20 June 1837 (viceroy from 22 February 1831). He was made Field Marshal 26 November 1813. While he was Viceroy, the Duke became patron of the . Regiment of the Hanoverian Army. This regiment was stationed in Celle, and their barracks, , were used by the Bundeswehr until 1995. The &quot;March of the &quot; is part of the Bundeswehr&#x27;s traditional music repertoire.

==Marriage==
After the death of Princess Charlotte in 1817, the Duke was set the task of finding a bride for his eldest unmarried brother, the Duke of Clarence (later William IV), in the hope of securing heirs to the throne—Charlotte had been the only legitimate grandchild of George III, despite the fact that the King had twelve surviving children. After several false starts, the Duke of Clarence settled on Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. The way was cleared for the Duke of Cambridge to find a bride for himself.

The Duke of Cambridge was married first at Kassel, Hesse on 7 May and then at Buckingham Palace on 1 June 1818 to his second cousin Augusta (25 July 1797 – 6 April 1889), the third daughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse.

==Viceroy==
From 1816 to 1837, the Duke of Cambridge served as viceroy of the Kingdom of Hanover on behalf of his elder brothers, George IV and later William IV. When his niece succeeded to the British throne on 20 June 1837 as Queen Victoria, the 122-year union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended, due to Hanover being under Salic Law; the succession of Ernest Augustus as King of Hanover saw the Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s period as viceroy end, and he returned to Britain.

==Death==
The Duke of Cambridge died on 8 July 1850 at Cambridge House, Piccadilly, London, and was buried in a specially-constructed extension to St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew. The Duchess was buried alongside him in 1889. Their remains were removed to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle in 1930. The Prince&#x27;s only son, Prince George, succeeded to his peerages.

<text>In consumer computer products, a beige box is a standard personal computer (PC). It has come to be used as a term of derision implying conservative or dated aesthetics and unremarkable specifications. The term is ultimately derived from the style of many early personal computers and dedicated word processors, which were usually beige or similar colors like off white or ecru. 

IBM&#x27;s early desktop computers (e.g. IBM Personal Computer, IBM PC/AT) were beige, and box-shaped, and most manufacturers of clones followed suit. As IBM and its imitators came to dominate the industry, these features became standards of desktop computer design.

Early Macintosh models were a beige color (specifically Pantone 453). Although Apple switched to a desaturated gray they called “Platinum” in 1987, users began to refer to them as “beige” following the introduction of the brightly colored iMac in 1998 and the Blue and White G3 in 1999. It eventually became a standard term to identify any previous Old World Macintosh, such as the “Beige G3.”

While the original Commodore 64 was a deeper brown (specifically, RAL 1019), its second revision in 1986, the C64C, was beige. The German-exclusive minor revision of the original form factor the following year, sometimes referred to as the C64G, combined the new beige color of the C64C with the original larger size case.

The term is also sometimes used to distinguish &quot;generic&quot; PCs from models made by &quot;name brands&quot; such as Compaq, Dell, or HP. In the early years of these companies, most of their units were beige as well. More recently, as name-brand manufacturers have moved away from beige (typically switching to black, dark gray, and silver-colored cases), inexpensive generic cases became more distinct as &quot;beige boxes&quot;. Today, the term &quot;white box&quot; has largely replaced this usage.

Its development, by Soviet inventor and science-fiction author Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues, began in 1946. In English, TRIZ is typically rendered as the theory of inventive problem solving.

TRIZ developed from a foundation of research into hundreds of thousands of inventions in many fields to produce an approach which defines patterns in inventive solutions and the characteristics of the problems these inventions have overcome. The research has produced three findings:
# Problems and solutions are repeated across industries and sciences.
# Patterns of technical evolution are replicated in industries and sciences.
# The innovations have scientific effects outside the field in which they were developed.

TRIZ applies these findings to create and improve products, services, and systems.

== History ==
TRIZ was developed by the Soviet inventor and science-fiction writer Genrich Altshuller and his associates. Altshuller began developing TRIZ in 1946 while working in the inventions-inspection department of the Caspian Sea flotilla of the Soviet Navy. His job was to help initiate invention proposals, to rectify and document them, and to prepare applications to the patent office. Altshuller realized that a problem requires an inventive solution if there are technical contradictions (improving one parameter negatively affects another).

His work on what later became TRIZ was interrupted in 1950 by his arrest and 25-year sentence to the Vorkuta Gulag. The arrest was partially triggered by letters he and Raphael Shapiro sent to Stalin, ministers, and newspapers about Soviet government decisions they considered erroneous. Altshuller and Shapiro were freed during the Khrushchev Thaw which followed Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, and they returned to Baku. The first paper on TRIZ, &quot;On the psychology of inventive creation&quot;, was published in 1956 in the &quot;Issues in Psychology&quot; (&quot;Voprosi Psichologii&quot;) journal.

Altshuller observed clever and creative people at work, discovering patterns in their thinking with which he developed thinking tools and techniques. The tools included Smart Little People and Thinking in Time and Scale (or the Screens of Talented Thought).

In 1986, Altshuller&#x27;s attention shifted from technical TRIZ to the development of individual creativity. He developed a version of TRIZ for children which was tried in several schools. After the Cold War, emigrants from the former Soviet Union brought TRIZ to other countries.

== Principles ==


One tool which evolved as an extension of TRIZ was a contradiction matrix. The ideal final result (IFR) is the ultimate solution of a problem when the desired result is achieved by itself.

Altshuller screened patents to discover which contradictions were resolved or eliminated by the invention and how this had been achieved. He developed a set of 40 inventive principles and, later, a matrix of contradictions. Although TRIZ was developed from analyzing technical systems, it has been used to understand and solve management problems. The German-based nonprofit European TRIZ Association, founded in 2000, hosts conferences with publications.

==Use in industry==
Samsung has invested in embedding TRIZ throughout the company.

BAE Systems and GE also use TRIZ, Mars has documented how TRIZ led to a new patent for chocolate packaging. It has been used by Leafield Engineering, Smart Stabilizer Systems, and Buro Happold to solve problems and generate new patents.

The automakers Rolls-Royce, Ford, and Daimler-Chrysler, Johnson &amp; Johnson, aeronautics companies Boeing, NASA, technology companies Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, General Electric, Xerox, IBM, LG, Samsung, Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble, Expedia, and Kodak have used TRIZ methods in projects.

TOP-TRIZ is a modern version of developed and integrated TRIZ methods. &quot;TOP-TRIZ includes further development of problem formulation and problem modeling, development of Standard Solutions into Standard Techniques, further development of ARIZ and Technology Forecasting. TOP-TRIZ has integrated its methods into a universal and user-friendly system for innovation.&quot; In 1992, several TRIZ practitioners fleeing the collapsing Soviet Union relocated and formed Ideation International. They developed I-TRIZ, their version of TRIZ.

In Liberating Structures, the facilitation method, also called TRIZ, was &quot;inspired by one small element of&quot; the original TRIZ methodology but is used in a distinct context. The method helps groups to identify and eliminate counterproductive practices by imagining the worst possible outcomes, recognizing current actions contributing to these scenarios, and designing practical steps to prevent them. This participatory approach emphasizes collaborative problem-solving within teams, setting it apart from the engineering-focused origins of the original TRIZ framework.

<text>The subjunctive (also known as conjunctive in some languages) is a grammatical mood, a feature of an utterance that indicates the speaker&#x27;s attitude toward it. Subjunctive forms of verbs are typically used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet occurred; the precise situations in which they are used vary from language to language. The subjunctive is one of the irrealis moods, which refer to what is not necessarily real. It is often contrasted with the indicative, a realis mood which principally indicates that something is a statement of fact.

Subjunctives occur most often, although not exclusively, in subordinate clauses, particularly &quot;that&quot;-clauses. Examples of the subjunctive in English are found in the sentences &quot;I suggest that you &quot;be&quot; careful&quot; and &quot;It is important that she &quot;stay&quot; by your side.&quot;

==Indo-European languages==

===Proto-Indo-European===
The Proto-Indo-European language, the reconstructed common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, had two closely related moods: the subjunctive and the optative. Many of its daughter languages combined or merged these moods.

In Indo-European, the subjunctive was formed by using the full ablaut grade of the root of the verb and appending the thematic vowel *&quot;-e-&quot; or *&quot;-o-&quot; to the root stem, with the full, primary set of personal inflections. The subjunctive was the Indo-European &quot;irrealis&quot;, used for hypothetical or counterfactual situations.

The optative mood was formed with a suffix *&quot;-ieh1&quot; or *&quot;-ih1&quot; (with a laryngeal). The optative used the clitic set of secondary personal inflections. The optative was used to express wishes or hopes.

Among the Indo-European languages, only Albanian, Avestan, Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit kept the subjunctive and the optative fully separate and parallel. However, in Sanskrit, use of the subjunctive is found only in the Vedic language of the earliest times, and the optative and imperative are comparatively less commonly used. In the later language (from c. 500 BC), the subjunctive fell out of use, with the optative or imperative being used instead, or merged with the optative as in Latin. However, the first-person forms of the subjunctive continue to be used, as they are transferred to the imperative, which formerly, like Greek, had no first person forms.

===Germanic languages===
In the Germanic languages, subjunctives are also usually formed from old optatives (a mood that indicates a wish or hope), with the present subjunctive marked with *&quot;-ai-&quot; and the past with *&quot;-ī-&quot;. In German, these forms have been reduced to a schwa, spelled &quot;-e&quot;. The past tense, however, often displays i-umlaut. In Old Norse, both suffixes evolved into &quot;-i-&quot;, but i-umlaut occurs in the past subjunctive, which distinguishes them.

====English====
In Modern English, the subjunctive is realised as a finite but tenseless clause where the main verb occurs in the &quot;bare&quot; form. Since the bare form is also used in a variety of other constructions, the English subjunctive is reflected by a clause type rather than a distinct inflectional paradigm.

====German====
German has

* Konjunktiv Präsens, which is a Konjunktiv I, e.g. &quot;er gehe&quot;
* Konjunktiv Imperfekt (&quot;or&quot; Präteritum), which is a Konjunktiv II, e.g. &quot;er ginge&quot;
* Konjunktiv Perfekt, which is a Konjunktiv I too, e.g. &quot;er sei gegangen&quot;
* Konjunktiv Plusquamperfekt, which is a Konjunktiv II too, e.g. &quot;er wäre gegangen&quot;

If the Konjunktiv II of the Futur I, e.g. &quot;ich würde gehen&quot;, and of the Futur II, e.g. &quot;ich würde gegangen sein&quot;, are called &quot;conditional&quot;, the numbers (I, II) can be dropped..
The present subjunctive occurs in certain expressions, (e.g. &quot;Long live the king!&quot;) and in indirect (reported) speech. Its use can frequently be replaced by the indicative mood. For example, (&#x27;He said he was a physician&#x27;) is a neutral representation of what was said and makes no claim as to whether the speaker thinks the reported statement is true or not.

The past subjunctive can often be used to express the same sentiments: Or, for example, instead of the formal, written &#x27;He said he had no time&#x27; with present subjunctive , one can use past subjunctive : 

In speech, however, the past subjunctive is common without any implication that the speaker doubts the speech he is reporting. As common is use of the indicative and This is often changed in written reports to the forms using present subjunctive.

The present subjunctive is completely regular for all verbs except the verb (&quot;to be&quot;). It is formed by adding to the stem of the infinitive. The verb has the stem for the present subjunctive declension, but it has no ending for the first and third person singular. While the use of present subjunctive for reported speech is formal and common in newspaper articles, its use in colloquial speech is in continual decline.

It is possible to express the subjunctive in various tenses, including the perfect ( &#x27;he has [apparently] been there&#x27;) and the future ( &#x27;he will be there&#x27;). For the preterite, which forms the Konjunktiv II with a somewhat other meaning, indirect speech has to switch to the perfect tense, so that: becomes 
The &quot;KII&quot; or past subjunctive is used to form the conditional tense and, on occasion, as a replacement for the present subjunctive when both indicative and subjunctive moods of a particular verb are indistinguishable.

Every German verb has a past subjunctive conjugation, but in spoken German the conditional is most commonly formed using (Konjunktiv II form of which in here is related to the English or rather than the literal ; dialect: , KII of &#x27;to do&#x27;) with an infinitive. For example: &#x27;I would not help him if I were you&#x27;. In the example, the Konjunktiv II form of (hülfe) is very unusual. However, using &#x27;würde&#x27; instead of (past subjunctive declension of &#x27;to have&#x27;) and (past subjunctive declension of &#x27;to be&#x27;) can be perceived anywhere from awkward (in-the-present use of the past subjunctive) to incorrect (in the past subjunctive). There is a tendency to use the forms in rather in main clauses as in English; in subclauses even regular forms (which sound like the indicative of the preterite and are, thus, obsolete in any other circumstances) can still be heard.

Some verbs exist for which either construction can be used, such as with () and (). Many dictionaries consider the past subjunctive declension of such verbs the only proper expression in formal written German.

The past subjunctive is declined from the stem of the preterite (imperfect) declension of the verb with the appropriate present subjunctive declension ending as appropriate. In most cases, an is appended to the stem vowel if possible (i.e. if it is , , or ), for example: .

====Dutch====

Dutch has the same subjunctive tenses as German (described above), though they are rare in contemporary speech. The same two tenses as in German are sometimes considered a subjunctive mood () and sometimes conditional mood (). In practice, potential subjunctive uses of verbs are difficult to differentiate from indicative uses. This is partly because the subjunctive mood has fallen together with the indicative mood:

* The plural of the subjunctive (both present and past) is always identical to the plural of the indicative. There are a few exceptions where the usage is clearly subjunctive, like: (May they rest in peace); compare to singular: (May he/she rest in peace).
* In the present tense, the singular form of the subjunctive differs from the indicative, having an extra &quot;-e&quot;. E.g., the subjunctive (May God bless you, my child) differs from the indicative (God blesses you, my child.)
* In the past tense, the singular form of the subjunctive of weak verbs (the vast majority of verbs) does not differ from the indicative at all, so that for those verbs there is no difference between indicative and subjunctive whatsoever in the past tense. Only for strong verbs, the preterite-present verbs and some irregular weak verbs does the past subjunctive differ from the past indicative, and only in the singular form. E.g., the subjunctive , and differ from the indicative &quot;had&quot;, &quot;was&quot; and (&quot;had&quot;, &quot;was&quot; and &quot;could&quot;).

Archaic and traditional phrases still contain the subjunctive mood:
* (&quot;Take ...&quot; - literally &quot;one take ...&quot; - as found in recipes)
* (&quot;Thy name be hallowed&quot; - from the Lord&#x27;s Prayer)
* (&quot;Hallowed be thy name&quot; - from the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, as used in Belgium until 2016)
* (&quot;So truly help me God almighty&quot; - when swearing an oath)
* (now a common Dutch curse; originally a request to God to curse something)
* (&quot;Thanks be to God&quot;)
* (&quot;Thanks to ...&quot; - literally &quot;Thank be ...&quot;)
* (&quot;Long live the king&quot;)

====Luxembourgish====
Luxembourgish has the same subjunctive tenses as German (described above). For the periphrasis however, is used instead of or (dialectal) .

====Swedish====
===Latin and the Romance languages===

====Latin====
The Latin subjunctive has many uses, contingent upon the nature of a clause within a sentence:

Within independent clauses:
*Exhortation or command
*Concession
*Wish
*Question of doubt
*Possibility or contingency

Within dependent clauses:
*Condition
*Purpose
*Characteristic
*Result
*Time
*Indirect questions

Historically, the Latin subjunctive originates from the ancestral optative inflections, while some of the original subjunctive forms went on to compose the Latin future tense, especially in the Latin third conjugation. The *&quot;-i-&quot; of the old optative forms manifests itself in the fact that the Latin subjunctives typically have a high vowel even when the indicative mood has a lower vowel; for example, Latin &quot;rogamus&quot;, &quot;we ask&quot;, in the indicative mood, corresponds to the subjunctive &quot;rogemus&quot;, &quot;let us ask&quot;, where &quot;e&quot; is a higher vowel than &quot;a&quot;.

The subjunctive mood retains a highly distinct form for nearly all verbs in Portuguese, Spanish and Italian (among other Romance languages), and for a number of verbs in French. All of these languages inherit their subjunctive from Latin, where the subjunctive mood combines both forms and usages from a number of original Indo-European inflection sets, including the original subjunctive and the optative mood.

In many cases, the Romance languages use the subjunctive in the same ways that English does; however, they use them in other ways as well. For example, English generally uses the auxiliary &#x27;may&#x27; or &#x27;let&#x27; to form desiderative expressions, such as &quot;Let it snow&quot;. The Romance languages use the subjunctive for these; French, for example, says, and . However, in the case of the first-person plural, these languages have imperative forms: &quot;Let us go&quot; in French is . In addition, the Romance languages tend to use the subjunctive in various kinds of subordinate clauses, such as those introduced by words meaning &quot;although&quot; English: &quot;Although I am old, I feel young&quot;; French: 

In Spanish, phrases with words like (that which, what), (who), or (where) and subjunctive verb forms are often translated to English with some variation of &quot;whatever&quot; or sometimes an indefinite pronoun. Spanish , which is, by a literal interpretation, along the lines of &quot;the thing which is&quot;, is translated as English &quot;whatever&quot; or &quot;anything&quot;; similarly, Spanish is English &quot;wherever&quot; and Spanish is English &quot;whoever&quot;. For example, Spanish , literally &quot;that which you want&quot;, is translated as English &quot;whatever you may want&quot;; Spanish is translated to English as &quot;whatever it may cost&quot;; and Spanish is translated to English as &quot;wherever you go, I go&quot;. The acronym W.E.I.R.D.O, is commonly used by English-speaking students of Spanish to learn the subjunctive. It &quot;usually&quot; stands for Wish Emotion Impersonal Expressions Reccomendations Doubt Ojalá. With the exception of &quot;negative commands,&quot; the subjunctive is always activated in the second clause, when a situation of &quot;W.E.I.R.D.O&quot; is present.

====French====
Present and past subjunctives

The subjunctive is used mostly with verbs or adverbs expressing desire, doubt or eventuality; it may also express an order. It is almost always preceded by the conjunction ().

Use of the subjunctive is in many respects similar to English:
* Jussive (issuing orders, commanding, or exhorting): (&quot;It is necessary that he &quot;understand&quot; that&quot;)
* Desiderative: (&quot;Long &quot;live&quot; the republic!&quot;)

Sometimes it is not:
* Desiderative: &quot; (&quot;Let&quot; there &quot;be&quot; light!&quot;)
* In certain subordinate clauses:
** : (&quot;Even though it &quot;is&quot; my birthday&quot;) (although English does introduce a similar subjunctive element in an alternative: &quot;It &quot;might&quot; be my birthday, but I am working&quot;
** (&quot;Before I &quot;go&quot; away&quot;)

French uses a past subjunctive, equivalent in tense to the in the indicative mood, called &quot;&quot;. It is the only other subjunctive tense used in modern-day conversational French. It is formed with the auxiliary or and the past participle of the verb. Unlike other Romance languages, such as Spanish, it is not always necessary that the preceding clause be in the past to trigger the in the subordinate clause:
Imperfect and pluperfect subjunctives

French also has an imperfect subjunctive, which in older, formal, or literary writing, replaces the present subjunctive in a subordinate clause when the main clause is in a past tense (including in the French conditional, which is morphologically a future-in-the-past): 

Similarly, pluperfect subjunctive replace past subjunctive in same context:

====Italian====
The Italian subjunctive () is commonly used, although, especially in the spoken language, it is sometimes substituted by the indicative.

The subjunctive is used mainly in subordinate clauses following a set phrase or conjunction, such as , , , or . It is also used with verbs of doubt, possibility and expressing an opinion or desire, for example with , and , and sometimes with superlatives and virtual superlatives.
* English: I believe (that) she the best.
* Italian: 

Differently from the French subjunctive, the Italian one is used after expressions like (&quot;I think that&quot;), where in French the indicative would be used. However, it is also possible to use the subjunctive after the expression (&quot;I don&#x27;t think that...&quot;), and in questions like (&quot;Do you think that...&quot;), even though the indicative forms can be correct, too.

=====Present subjunctive=====
The present subjunctive is similar to, but still mostly distinguishable from, the present indicative. Subject pronouns are often used with the present subjunctive where they are normally omitted in the indicative, since in the first, second and third person singular forms they are the same, so the person is not implicitly implied from the verb. Irregular verbs tend to follow the first person singular form, such as the present subjunctive forms of , which goes to etc. (first person singular form is ).

The present subjunctive is used in a range of situations in clauses taking the subjunctive.
* English: &quot;It is possible that they have to leave.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;
* English: &quot;My parents want me to play the piano.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;

The present subjunctive is used mostly in subordinate clauses, as in the examples above. However, exceptions include imperatives using the subjunctive (using the third person), and general statements of desire.
* English: &quot;Be careful!&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;
* English: &quot;Long live the republic!&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;

=====Imperfect subjunctive=====
The Italian imperfect subjunctive is very similar in appearance to (but used much more in speech than) the French imperfect subjunctive, and forms are largely regular, apart from the verbs and (which go to and etc.). However, unlike in French, where it is often replaced with the present subjunctive, the imperfect subjunctive is far more common. Verbs with a contracted infinitive, such as (short for ) revert to the longer form in the imperfect subjunctive (to give etc., for example).

The imperfect subjunctive is used in subordinate clauses taking the subjunctive where the sense of the verb requires the imperfect.
* English: &quot;It seemed that Elsa &quot;was not coming&quot;.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;
* English: &quot;The teacher slowed down, so that we &quot;would understand&quot; everything.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;

The imperfect subjunctive is used in &quot;if&quot; clauses, where the main clause is in the conditional tense, as in English and German.
* English: &quot;If I &quot;had&quot; a lot of money, I would buy many cars.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;
* English: &quot;You would know if we &quot;were lying&quot;.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;

=====Perfect and pluperfect subjunctives=====
The perfect and pluperfect subjunctives are formed much like the indicative perfect and pluperfect, except the auxiliary (either or ) verb takes the present and imperfect subjunctive respectively.

They are used in subordinate clauses which require the subjunctive, where the sense of the verb requires use of the perfect or pluperfect.
* English: &quot;Although they &quot;had&quot; not &quot;killed&quot; the doctor, the police arrested the men.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;
* English: &quot;I would have done it, provided you &quot;had helped&quot; me.&quot;
* Italian: &quot;&quot;

====Spanish====

The subjunctive mood () is a fundamental element of Spanish. Its spoken form makes use of it to a much larger degree than other Latin languages and it is in no case homonymous to any other mood. Furthermore, it is common to find long complex sentences almost entirely in the subjunctive.

The subjunctive is used in conjunction with impersonal expressions and expressions of emotion, opinion, desire or viewpoint. More importantly, it applies to most hypothetical situations, likely or unlikely, desired or not. Normally, only certitude of (or statement of) a fact will remove the possibility of its use. Unlike French, it is also used in phrases expressing the past conditional. The negative of the imperative shares the same form with the present subjunctive.

Common introductions to the subjunctive would include the following:
* or as in (present subjunctive) (present subjunctive): &quot;Let it be what God wills&quot;.
* : &quot;If..&quot; (e.g. : &quot;if you were...&quot;)
* : &quot;Where..&quot; (e.g. , &quot;anywhere&quot;)
* : &quot;When..&quot; (referring to a future time, e.g. , &quot;when I go&quot;)
* : &quot;Despite/although/even if...&quot;
* &quot;I hope...&quot; (derived from Arabic ) e.g. (present subjunctive) &quot;I hope it rains&quot; or (past subjunctive) &quot;I wish it would rain&quot;.

Nevertheless, the subjunctive can stand alone to supplant other tenses.

For example, &quot;I would like&quot; can be said in the conditional or in the past subjunctive , as in (past subjunctive) (past subjunctive), i.e. &quot;I would like you to come&quot;.

Comfort with the subjunctive form and the degree to which a second-language speaker attempts to avoid its use can be an indicator of the level of proficiency in the language. Complex use of the subjunctive is a constant pattern of everyday speech among native speakers but difficult to interiorize even by relatively proficient Spanish learners (e.g. I would have liked you to come on Thursday: (conditional perfect) (past subjunctive) 

An example of the subtlety of the Spanish subjunctive is the way the tense (past, present or future) modifies the expression &quot;be it as it may&quot; (literally &quot;be what it be&quot;):
* (present subjunctive + present subjunctive): &quot;No matter what/whatever.&quot;
* (present subjunctive + past subjunctive): &quot;Whatever it were.&quot;
* (past subjunctive + past subjunctive): (Similar meaning to above).
* . (Present subjunctive + future subjunctive): &quot;Whatever it may be.&quot;
* . (Past subjunctive + past pluperfect subjunctive): &quot;Whatever/no matter what it may have been&quot;.

The same alterations could be made to the expression or &quot;no matter how&quot; with similar changes in meaning.

Spanish has two past subjunctive forms. They are almost identical, except that where the &quot;first form&quot; has , the &quot;second form&quot; has . Both forms are usually interchangeable although the form may be more common in Spain than in other Spanish-speaking areas. The forms may also be used as an alternative to the conditional in certain structures.

Present subjunctive

In Spanish, a present subjunctive form is always different from the corresponding present indicative form. For example, whereas English &quot;that they speak&quot; or French can be either indicative or subjunctive, Spanish is unambiguously subjunctive. (The corresponding indicative would be .) The same is true for all verbs, regardless of their subject.

When to use:
* When there are two clauses, separated by . However, not all clauses require the subjunctive mood. They must have at least one of the following criteria:
* As the fourth edition of states, when the verb of the main clause expresses emotion (e.g. fear, happiness, sorrow, etc.)
* Impersonal expressions are used in the main clause. (It is important that...)
* The verb in the second clause is the one that is in subjunctive.

Examples:
* (I hope that they will buy me a gift.)
* (I recommend that you not run with scissors.)
* (I doubt that the restaurant might open at six.)
* (We will talk about it when he/she comes.)
* (It is important that we exercise.)
* (I am happy that you are my friend.)

Past (imperfect) subjunctive

Used interchangeably, the past (imperfect) subjunctive can end either in or . Both forms stem from the third-person plural (&quot;ellos, ellas, ustedes&quot;) of the preterite. For example, the verb , when conjugated in the third-person plural of the preterite, becomes . Then, drop the ending, and add either or . Thus, it becomes or . The past subjunctive may be used with &quot;if... then&quot; statements with the conditional mood. Example:
* (If I &quot;were&quot; the teacher, I would not give too much homework.)

Future subjunctive

In Spanish, the future subjunctive tense is now rare but still used in certain dialects of Spanish and in formal speech. It is usually reserved for literature, archaic phrases and expressions, and legal documents. (The form is similar to the form of the imperfect subjunctive, but with a ending instead of , instead of and so on.) Example:
* (If I don&#x27;t do it, may God and the fatherland demand it from me.)

Phrases expressing the subjunctive in a future period normally employ the present subjunctive. For example: &quot;I hope that it &quot;will rain&quot; tomorrow&quot; would simply be (where is the third-person singular present subjunctive of , &quot;to rain&quot;).

Pluperfect (past perfect) subjunctive

In Spanish, the pluperfect subjunctive tense is used to describe a continuing wish in the past. (I wish that you had gone to the movies with me last Friday). To form this tense, first the subjunctive form of is conjugated (in the example above, becomes ). Then the participle of the main verb (in this case is added, becomes ).
* (I would have liked if you &quot;had gone&quot;, but he failed his math test.)

Though the form appears to be more closely related to the imperfect subjunctive form than the form, that is not the case. The form of the imperfect subjunctive derives from the pluperfect subjunctive of Vulgar Latin and the from the pluperfect indicative, combining to overtake the previous pluperfect subjunctive ending. The form is more complicated, stemming (so to speak) from a fusion of the perfect subjunctive and future perfect indicative—which, though in different moods, happened to be identical in the second and third persons—before losing the perfect in the shift to future subjunctive, the same perfect nature that was the only thing the forms originally shared. So the and forms always had a past (to be specific, pluperfect) meaning, but only the form always belonged with the subjunctive mood that the form had since its emergence.

====Portuguese====
In Portuguese, as in Spanish, the subjunctive (&quot;subjuntivo&quot; or &quot;conjuntivo&quot;) is complex, being generally used to talk about situations which are seen as doubtful, imaginary, hypothetical, demanded, or required. It can also express emotion, opinion, disagreement, denial, or a wish. Its value is similar to the one it has in formal English:

Present subjunctive
* Command: &quot; Faça-se luz!&quot; &quot;Let there be light!&quot;
* Wish: &quot; Viva o rei!&quot; &quot;Long live the king!&quot;
* Necessity: &quot;É importante que ele compreenda isso.&quot; &quot;It is important that he &quot;understand&quot; that.&quot;
* In certain, subordinate clauses:
** &quot;Ainda que seja o meu aniversário...&quot; &quot;Even though &quot;it be&quot; my birthday...&quot;
** &quot;Antes que eu vá...&quot; &quot;Before &quot;I go&quot;...&quot;
Imperfect (past) subjunctive

As in Spanish, the imperfect subjunctive is in vernacular use, and it is employed, among other things, to make the tense of a subordinate clause agree with the tense of the main clause:
* English: &quot;It is&quot; [present indicative] necessary that &quot;he speak&quot; [present subjunctive]. → &quot;It was&quot; [past indicative] necessary that &quot;he speak&quot; [present subjunctive].
* Portuguese: &quot;É&quot; [present indicative] &quot;necessário que ele fale&quot; [present subjunctive]. → &quot;Era necessário&quot; [past (imperfect) indicative] &quot;que ele falasse&quot; [past (imperfect) subjunctive].

The imperfect subjunctive is also used when the main clause is in the conditional:
* English: It &quot;would be&quot; [conditional] necessary that &quot;he speak&quot; [present subjunctive].
* Portuguese: &quot;Seria&quot; [conditional] &quot;necessário que ele falasse&quot; [imperfect subjunctive].

There are authors who regard the conditional of Portuguese as a &quot;future in the past&quot; of the indicative mood, rather than as a separate mood; they call it &quot;futuro do pretérito&quot; (&quot;future of the past&quot;), especially in Brazil.

Future subjunctive

Portuguese differs from other Ibero-Romance languages in having retained the medieval future subjunctive (&quot;futuro do subjuntivo&quot;), which is rarely used in Spanish and has been lost in other West Iberic languages. It expresses a condition that must be fulfilled in the future, or is assumed to be fulfilled, before an event can happen. Spanish and English will use the present tense in this type of clause.

For example, in conditional sentences whose main clause is in the conditional, Portuguese, Spanish and English employ the past tense in the subordinate clause. Nevertheless, if the main clause is in the future, Portuguese will employ the future subjunctive where English and Spanish use the present indicative. (English, when being used in a rigorously formal style, takes the present subjunctive in these situations, example: &quot;Should I be, then...&quot;) Contrast the following two sentences.
* English: If &quot;I were&quot; [past subjunctive] king, I would end [conditional] hunger.
** Spanish: &quot;Si fuera&quot; [imperfect subjunctive] &quot;rey, acabaría con&quot; [conditional] &quot;el hambre&quot;.
** Portuguese: &quot;Se fosse&quot; [imperfect subjunctive] &quot;rei, acabaria com&quot; [conditional] &quot;a fome&quot;.
* English: If &quot;I am&quot; [present indicative] [technical English is &quot;should I &quot;be&quot;&quot; present subjunctive] elected president, I will change [future indicative] the law.
** Spanish: &quot;Si soy&quot; [present indicative] &quot;elegido presidente, cambiaré&quot; [future indicative] &quot;la ley&quot;.
** Portuguese: &quot;Se for&quot; [future subjunctive] &quot;eleito presidente, mudarei&quot; [future indicative] &quot;a lei&quot;.

The first situation is counterfactual; the listener knows that the speaker is not a king. However, the second statement expresses a promise about the future; the speaker may yet be elected president.

For a different example, a father speaking to his son might say:
* English: When &quot;you are&quot; [present indicative] older, you will understand [future indicative].
* Spanish: &quot;Cuando seas&quot; [present subjunctive] &quot;mayor, comprenderás&quot; [future indicative].
* French: &quot;Quand tu seras&quot; [future indicative] &quot;grand, tu comprendras&quot; [future indicative].
* Italian: &quot;Quando sarai&quot; [future indicative] &quot;grande, comprenderai&quot; [future indicative].
* Portuguese: &quot;Quando fores&quot; [future subjunctive] &quot;mais velho, compreenderás&quot; [future indicative].

The future subjunctive is identical in form to the personal infinitive in regular verbs, but they differ in some irregular verbs of frequent use. However, the possible differences between the two tenses are due only to stem changes. They always have the same endings.

The meaning of sentences can change by switching subjunctive and indicative:
* &quot;Ele pensou que eu fosse alto&quot; (He thought that I was tall [and I am not])
* &quot;Ele pensou que eu era alto&quot; (He thought that I was tall [and I am or I am not sure whether I am or not])
* &quot;Se formos lá&quot; (If we go there)
* &quot;Se vamos lá&quot; (equivalent to &quot;if we are going there&quot;)

Below, there is a table demonstrating subjunctive and conditional conjugation for regular verbs of the first paradigm (-ar), exemplified by &quot;falar&quot; (to speak) .

Compound subjunctives

Compound verbs in subjunctive are necessary in more complex sentences, such as subordinate clauses with embedded perfective tenses e.g., perfective state in the future. To form compound subjunctives auxiliar verbs (&quot;ter&quot; or &quot;haver&quot;) must conjugate to the respective subjunctive tense, while the main verbs must take their participles.

*Queria que &quot;houvesses sido eleito&quot; presidente (I wish you &quot;had been elected&quot; president)
*É importante que &quot;hajas compreendido&quot; isso. (It is important that you &quot;have comprehended&quot; that)
*Quando &quot;houver sido eleito&quot; presidente, mudarei a lei (When I &quot;will have been elected&quot; president, I will change the law)
*A cidade &quot;haver-se-ia afundado&quot; se não fosse por seus alicerces (The city &quot;would have sunk&quot;, if not for its foundation)

====Romanian====

Romanian is part of the Balkan Sprachbund and as such uses the subjunctive (&quot;conjunctiv&quot;) more extensively than other Romance languages. The subjunctive forms always include the conjunction &quot;să&quot;, which within these verbal forms plays the role of a morphological structural element. The subjunctive has two tenses: the past tense and the present tense. It is usually used in subordinate clauses.

Present subjunctive

The present subjunctive is usually built in the 1st and 2nd person singular and plural by adding the conjunction &quot;să&quot; before the present indicative (indicative: &quot;am&quot; I have; conjunctive: &quot;să am&quot; (that) I have; indicative: &quot;vii&quot; you come; conjunctive: &quot;să vii&quot; (t/hat) you come). In the 3rd person most verbs have a specific conjunctive form which differs from the indicative either in the ending or in the stem itself; there is however no distinction between the singular and plural of the present conjunctive in the 3rd person (indicative: &quot;are&quot; he has; conjunctive: &quot;să aibă&quot; (that) he has; indicative: &quot;au&quot; they have; conjunctive: &quot;să aibă&quot; (that) they have; indicative: &quot;vine&quot; he comes; conjunctive: &quot;să vină&quot; (that) he comes; indicative: &quot;vin&quot; they come; conjunctive: &quot;să vină&quot; (that) they come).

The present tense is by far the most widely used of the two subjunctive tenses and is used frequently after verbs that express wish, preference, permission, possibility, request, advice, etc.: &quot;a vrea&quot; to want, &quot;a dori&quot; to wish, &quot;a prefera&quot; to prefer, &quot;a lăsa&quot; to let, to allow, &quot;a ruga&quot; to ask, &quot;a sfătui&quot; to advise, &quot;a sugera&quot; to suggest, &quot;a recomanda&quot; to recommend, &quot;a cere&quot; to demand, to ask for, &quot;a interzice&quot; to forbid, &quot;a permite&quot; to allow, to give permission, &quot;a se teme&quot; to be afraid, etc.

When used independently, the subjunctive indicates a desire, a fear, an order or a request, i.e. has modal and imperative values. The present subjunctive is used in questions having the modal value of &quot;should&quot;:
* &quot;Să plec?&quot; Should I leave?
* &quot;Să mai stau?&quot; Should I stay longer?
* &quot;De ce să plece?&quot; Why should he/she leave?

The present subjunctive is often used as an imperative, mainly for other persons than the second person. When used with the second person, it is even stronger than the imperative. The first-person plural can be preceded by the interjection &quot;hai&quot;, which intensifies the imperative meaning of the structure:
* &quot;Să mergem!&quot; Let us go! or &quot;Hai să mergem!&quot; Come on, let&#x27;s go!
* &quot;Să plece imediat!&quot; I want him to leave immediately!
* &quot;Să-mi aduci un pahar de apă!&quot; Bring me a glass of water!

The subjunctive present is used in certain set phrases used as greetings in specific situations:
* &quot;Să creşti mare!&quot; (to a child, after he or she declared his or her age or thanked for something)
* &quot;Să ne (să-ţi, să vă) fie de bine!&quot; (to people who have finished their meals)
* &quot;Să-l (să o, să le etc.) porţi sănătos / sănătoasă!&quot; (when somebody shows up in new clothes, with new shoes)
* &quot;Dumnezeu să-l (s-o, să-i, să le) ierte!&quot; (after mentioning the name of a person who died recently)
Past subjunctive

The past tense of the subjunctive mood has one form for all persons and numbers of all the verbs, which is &quot;să fi&quot; followed by the past participle of the verb. The past subjunctive is used after the past optative-conditional of the verbs that require the subjunctive (&quot;a trebui, a vrea, a putea, a fi bine, a fi necesar&quot;, etc.), in constructions that express the necessity, the desire in the past:
* &quot;Ar fi trebuit să fi rămas acasă.&quot; You should have stayed home.
* &quot;Ar fi fost mai bine să mai fi stat.&quot; It would have been better if we had stayed longer.

When used independently, the past subjunctive indicates a regret related to a past-accomplished action that is seen as undesirable at the moment of speaking:
* &quot;Să fi rămas acasă&quot; We should have stayed at home. (Note: the same construction can be used for all persons and numbers.)

===Celtic languages===

====Welsh====
In Welsh, there are two forms of the subjunctive: present and imperfect. The present subjunctive is barely ever used in spoken Welsh except in certain fixed phrases, and is restricted in most cases to the third person singular. However, it is more likely to be found in literary Welsh, most widely in more old-fashioned registers. The third-person singular is properly used after certain conjunctions and prepositions but in spoken Welsh the present subjunctive is frequently replaced by either the infinitives, the present tense, the conditional, or the future tense (this latter is called the present-future by some grammarians).


The imperfect subjunctive, as in English, only affects the verb (&quot;to be&quot;). It is used after (a form of &quot;if&quot;) and it must be accompanied by the conditional subjunctive e.g. = &quot;If I were rich, I would travel throughout the world.&quot;

For all other verbs in Welsh, as in English, the imperfect subjunctive takes the same stems as do the conditional subjunctive and the imperfect indicative.

====Scottish Gaelic====
In Scottish Gaelic, the subjunctive does exist but still takes the forms from the indicative: the present subjunctive takes the (dependent) future forms and the past subjunctive takes the conditional forms. The subjunctive is normally used in proverbs or truisms in phrases that start with &#x27;May...&#x27;
For example,
* &quot;Gum bi Rìgh Ruisiart beò fada!&quot; – Long live King Richard (lit. May King Richard live long).
* &quot;Gum bi beanachd Dè oirbh uile!&quot; – May God bless you all!
* &quot;Gun gabh e a fhois ann sìth&quot; – May he rest in peace.

Or when used as the conjunction, the subjunctive is used, like every other language, in a more demanding or wishful statement:
* &quot;Se àm gum fàg e a-nis.&quot; – It is time that he leave now.
* &quot;Tha e riatanach gun tèid iad gu sgoil gach là.&quot; – It is necessary that they go to school every day.
* &quot;Dh&#x27;fhaighnich e nach faic mi ise.&quot; – He asked that I not see her.

The subjunctive in Gaelic will sometimes have the conjunction &quot;gun&quot; (or &quot;gum&quot; before verbs beginning with labial consonants: &quot;p&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;m&quot; or &quot;f&quot;) can be translated as &#x27;that&#x27; or as &#x27;May ...&#x27; while making a wish. For negatives, &quot;nach&quot; is used instead. 

Note that the present subjunctive is identical to the dependent future tense form, which lacks the ending &quot;-idh&quot;! 

In Scottish Gaelic, the past subjunctive of the verb &quot;bi&quot; &#x27;be&#x27; is &quot;robh&quot;, exactly the same as the dependent form of the preterite indicative. 

For every other verb in Gaelic, the past subjunctive is identical to the conditional. 

Examples:
* &quot;Nan robh mi beairteach, shiubhlainn air feadh an t-saoghail.&quot; - If I were rich, I would travel all over the world.
* &quot;Mura dèanainn m&#x27; obair-dhachaigh, bhithinn ann an trioblaid.&quot; - If I had not done my homework, I would have been in trouble.
Or: &quot;Mura robh mi air m&#x27; obair-dhachaigh a dhèanamh, bhithinn (air a bhith) ann an trioblaid.&quot;

====Irish====
In the Irish language (Gaeilge), the subjunctive, like in Scottish Gaelic (its sister language), covers the idea of wishing something and so appears in some famous Irish proverbs and blessings. It is considered an old-fashioned tense for daily speech (except in set phrases) but still appears often in print.

The subjunctive is normally formed from &quot;Go&quot; (which eclipses, and adds &quot;n-&quot; to a verb beginning with a vowel), plus the subjunctive form of the verb, plus the subject, plus the thing being wished for. For instance, the subjunctive form of &quot;téigh&quot; (go) is &quot;té&quot;:
* Go dté tú slán. – May you be well. (lit: may you go well)

Or again, the subjunctive of &quot;tabhair&quot; (give) is &quot;tuga&quot;:
* Go dtuga Dia ciall duit. – May God give you sense.

Or to take a third example, sometimes the wish is also a curse, like this one from Tory Island in Donegal:
* Go ndéana an Diabhal toirneach de d&#x27;anam in Ifreann. – May the Devil make thunder of your soul in Hell.

The subjunctive is generally formed by taking the stem of the verb and adding on the appropriate subjunctive ending depending on broad or slender, and first or second conjugation. For example, to the stem of bog &quot;(to move)&quot; is added -a giving as its subjunctive in the first person boga mé:

First conjugation:

Second conjugation:

E.g. &quot;go mbeannaí Dia thú&quot; – May God bless you.

There is also some irregularity in certain verbs in the subjunctive. The verb bí &quot;(to be)&quot; is the most irregular verb in Irish (as in most Indo-European languages):
The Irish phrase for &quot;thank you&quot; – go raibh maith agat – uses the subjunctive of &quot;bí&quot; and literally means &quot;may there be good at-you&quot;.

Some verbs do not follow the conjugation of the subjunctive exactly as conjugated above. These irregularities apply to verbs whose stem ends already in a stressed vowel and thus due to the rules of Irish orthography and pronunciation, cannot take another. For example:
* Although feoigh doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;síneadh fada&quot; (accent), the &#x27;o&#x27; in this position is stressed (pronounced as though it is ó) and thus the subjunctive is irregular.

Where the subjunctive is used in English, it may not be used in Irish and another tense might be used instead. For example:
* If I were (past subjunctive) you, I would study for the exam tomorrow. – Dá mba (past/conditional of the copula) mise tusa, dhéanfainn (conditional) staidéar le haghaidh an scrúdaithe amárach.
* I wish *(that) you were (past sub.) here. – Is mian liom go raibh (present sub.) tú anseo.
* It is important that he choose (present sub.) the right way—Tá sé tábhachtach go roghnóidh (future indicative) sé ar an mbealach ceart.
*** When you&#x27;re older (present ind.), you&#x27;ll understand – Nuair a bheidh/bheas (future ind.) tú níos sine, tuigfidh tú.
** Note that in English, the relative pronoun that can be omitted; in Irish, the corresponding go must be retained.
*** Note that in English, the present tense is often used to refer to a future state whereas in Irish there is less freedom with tenses (i.e. time is more strictly bound to the appropriate tense, present for present, past for past, future for future). In this particular example, &quot;you will be older&quot; and it is then that &quot;you will understand&quot;.

=== Indo-Aryan languages ===

==== Hindi-Urdu ====
There are two subjunctive moods in Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani), first the regular subjunctive and the second, the perfective subjunctive which superficially has the same form as the perfective aspect forms of verbs but still expresses future events, it is only ever used with if clauses and relative pronouns. In a semantic analysis, this use of the perfective aspect marker would not be considered perfective, since it is more closely related to subjunctive usage. Only the superficial form is identical to that of the perfective.

The regular subjunctive mood can be put in two tenses; present and future. There is another mood, called the contrafactual mood, which serves as both the past subjunctive and the past conditional mood in Hindustani. Hindi-Urdu, apart from the non-aspectual forms (or the simple aspect) has three grammatical aspects (habitual, perfective &amp; progressive) and each aspect can be put five grammatical moods (indicative, presumptive, subjunctive, contrafactual &amp; imperative). The subjunctive mood can be put in the present tense only for the verb honā&quot; (to be) for any other verb only the future sujunctive form exists. Subjunctive mood forms for all the three grammatical aspects of Hindustani for the verbs honā (to be) and karnā&quot; (to do) are shown in the table below.




===Slavic languages===
The Slavic languages lost the Proto-Indo-European subjunctive altogether, while the old optative was repurposed as the imperative mood. Some modern Slavic languages have developed a new subjunctive-like construction, although there is no consistent terminology. For example, some authors do not distinguish the subjunctive mood from the optative (&quot;wishing&quot;) mood,
others do.

====Polish====
The subjunctive mood is formed using the &quot;by&quot; particle, either alone or forming a single word with the complex conjunctions &quot;żeby&quot;, &quot;iżby&quot;, &quot;ażeby&quot;, &quot;aby&quot;, &quot;coby&quot;. The mood does not have its own morphology, but instead a rule that the &quot;by&quot;-containing particle must be placed in front of the dependent clause. Compare:
* &quot;Upieram się, że wychodzi&quot; indicative - I insist that he is leaving;
* &quot;Upieram się, (że)by wyszedł&quot; subjunctive - I insist that he leave;
* &quot;Upieram się, że wyszedłby&quot; conditional - I insist that he would leave.

The subjunctive mood in the dependent clause is obligatory in the case of certain independent clauses, for example it is incorrect to say &lt;del&gt;&quot;chcę, że to zrobi&quot;&lt;/del&gt;, but the subjunctive mood must be used instead: &quot;chcę, by to zrobił&quot;.

The subjunctive can never be mistaken with the conditional, despite that in the case of the conditional mood the clitic &quot;by&quot; and derivatives can move. See that in the following examples:
* &quot;Upieram się, że wtedy by nie wyszedł&quot; conditional - I insist that he would not have left then [at that time];
* &quot;Upieram się, że by wówczas nie wyszedł&quot; conditional - I insist that he would not have left then/[at that time]/[in that case];
* &quot;Myślę, że on by akurat wyszedł&quot; conditional - I think that he would have just left [a moment ago];
* &quot;Myślę, że gdyby wyszedł, ...&quot; conditional - I think, that if he would have left, ...
There is no conjunction, which would indicate the subjunctive. In particular, there is no &quot;żeby&quot;.

Compare to the closely related optative mood, e.g. the subjunctive &quot;nie nalegam, by wysłał list&quot; vs the optative &quot;oby wysłał list&quot;.

====Bulgarian====
Modal distinctions in subordinate clauses are expressed not through verb endings, but through the choice of complementizer - &quot;че (che)&quot; or &quot;да (da)&quot; (which might both be translated with the relative pronoun &quot;that&quot;). The verbs remain unchanged. In ordinary sentences, the imperfective aspect is most often used for the indicative, and the perfective for the subjunctive, but any combination is possible, with the corresponding change in meaning.
* e.g. iskam da stanesh (perfective) / iskam da stavash (imperfective) - i want you to get up.
The latter is more insisting, since the imperfective is the more immediate construction. Thus:
* Indicative - че -
** e.g. &quot;знам, че си тук - znam, che si tuk&quot; - I know that you are here;
* Subjunctive - да -
** e.g. &quot;настоявам да си тук - nastoyavam da si tuk&quot; - I insist that you be here.

==Semitic languages==

===Arabic===
In Classical Arabic, the verb in its imperfect aspect (&quot;al-muḍāri‘&quot;) has a subjunctive form called the &quot;manṣūb&quot; form (). It is distinct from the imperfect indicative in most of its forms: where the indicative has &quot;-u&quot;, the subjunctive has &quot;-a&quot;; and where the indicative has &quot;-na&quot; or &quot;-ni&quot;, the subjunctive has nothing at all. (The &quot;-na&quot; ending in the second and third-person plural feminine is different: it marks the gender and number, not the mood, and therefore it is there in both the indicative and subjunctive.)
* Indicative third singular masc. &quot;yaktubu&quot; &quot;he writes / is writing / will write&quot; → Subjunctive &quot;yaktuba&quot; &quot;he may / should write&quot;
* Indicative third plural masc. &quot;yaktubūna&quot; &quot;they write&quot; → Subjunctive &quot;yaktubū&quot; &quot;they may write&quot;
* Indicative third plural fem. &quot;yaktubna&quot; &quot;they write&quot; = Subjunctive &quot;yaktubna&quot; &quot;they may write&quot;

The subjunctive is used in &quot;that&quot;-clauses, after Arabic &quot;an&quot;: &quot;urīdu an aktuba&quot; &quot;I want to write.&quot; However, in conditional and precative sentences, such as &quot;if he goes&quot; or &quot;let him go&quot;, a different mood of the imperfect aspect, the jussive, &quot;majzūm&quot;, is used.

In many spoken Arabic dialects, there remains a distinction between indicative and subjunctive; however, it is not through a suffix but rather a prefix.

In Levantine Arabic, the indicative has &quot;b-&quot; while the subjunctive lacks it:
* third sing. masc. &quot;huwwe byuktob&quot; &quot;he writes / is writing / will write&quot;, versus &quot;yuktob&quot; &quot;he may / should write&quot;
* third plural masc. &quot;homme byukotbu&quot;, versus &quot;yukotbu&quot;

Egyptian Arabic uses a simple construction that precedes the conjugated verbs with (&quot;law&quot; &quot;if&quot;) or (&quot;momken&quot; &quot;may&quot;); the following are some examples:
* (Law/Momken enti tektebi. &quot;If /Maybe you write&quot;) (s.f)
* (Law/Momken enti katabti. &quot;If /Maybe you wrote&quot;) (s.f)
* (Law/Momken enti konti tektebi.&quot;If /Maybe you would write&quot;) (s.f)
* (Law/Momken enti ḥatektebi. &quot;If /Maybe you will write&quot;) (s.f)

Tunisian Arabic often precedes the imperfective indicative verb by various conjunctions to create the subjunctive:

Ma:
*Mē ʕandak ma tekteb. You have nothing to write
Literally: not at.you subj_tool you_write

Ken for wish, hope or opinion:
*Netmanna, ken nʃūfak nējeħ nhār. I wish i&#x27;d see you successful one day: &quot;Wish&quot;
*Ken yeʃlēqu. (I) hope they find out: &quot;Hope&quot;
*(Men rayi,) Ken temʃi tertēħ. (In my opinion,) It&#x27;s better [for your health] to relax: &quot;Opinion&quot;

Taw for a highly-expected possibility:
*Abqa hne, taw toxles. Stay here (and) you will/could get paid

Ra for inevitability but it&#x27;s, in most cases, accompanied with &quot;ken&quot; in the other clause:
*Ken tkūn ðˤʕīf, rak bēʃ tetʕeb fe ħyētak. Once you get weak, you&#x27;ll suffer in life

===Hebrew===
Final short vowels were elided in Hebrew in prehistoric times, so that the distinction between the Proto-Semitic indicative, subjunctive and jussive (similar to Classical Arabic forms) had largely been lost even in Biblical Hebrew. The distinction does remain for some verbal categories, where the original final morphemes effected lasting secondary changes in word-internal syllabic structure and vowel length. These include weak roots with a medial or final vowel, such as versus &quot;may he rise&quot; and versus , imperfect forms of the &quot;hiphil&quot; stem, and also generally for first person imperfect forms: (imperfect indicative of &#x27;sit&#x27;) vs. (imperfect cohortative=volitive of &#x27;sit&#x27;). In modern Hebrew, the situation has been carried even further, with forms like and becoming non-productive; instead, the future tense (prefix conjugation) is used for the subjunctive, often with the particle added to introduce the clause, if it is not already present (similar to French ).
* – or (literally, )
* – (literally, )

Biblical subjunctive forms survive in non-productive phrases in such forms as the third-person singular of ( , or ) and ( , ), mostly in a literary register:
* – (literally, )
* – (literally, ) (a popular song in Hebrew, by Naomi Shemer)

===Akkadian===
Subordinate clauses in Babylonian and Standard Babylonian Akkadian are marked with a &quot;-u&quot; on verbs ending in a consonant, and with nothing after vocalic endings or after ventive endings. Due to the consonantal structure of semitic languages, and Akkadian sound laws, the addition of the -u might trigger short vowels in the middle of the word to disappear. Assyrian Akkadian uses a more complicated system with both -u and -ni as markers of subordination. The ending -ni was used in the instances where -u could not be used as stated above. During Middle and Neo Assyrian the -ni ending became compulsory on all subordinate verbs, even those that already had the -u, resulting in -ni and-ūni as markers of subordination.

==Uralic languages==

===Hungarian===
This mood in Hungarian is generally used to express polite demands and suggestions. The endings are identical between imperative, conjunctive and subjunctive; it is therefore often called the conjunctive-imperative mood.

Examples:
* – &#x27;Give it to me.&#x27; – demand
* – &#x27;Let&#x27;s go.&#x27; – suggestion
* – &#x27;Shall I go?&#x27; – suggestion or question
* – &#x27;Go!&#x27; – demand

Note that &quot;demand&quot; is nowhere near as rude as it might sound in English. It is a polite but firm request, but not as polite as, say, &quot;would you...&quot;.

The characteristic letter in its ending is , and in the definite conjunctive conjugation the endings appear very similar to those of singular possession, with a leading letter .

An unusual feature of the mood&#x27;s endings is that there exist a short and a long form for the second person singular (i.e., &quot;you&quot;). The formation of this for regular verbs differs between the indefinite and definite: the indefinite requires just the addition of , which differs from the longer ending in that the last two sounds are omitted ( and not for example in above, cf. ). The short version of the definite form also drops two letters, but another two. It drops, for example: the in , leaving just , as can be seen in above (instead of ).

There are several groups of exceptions involving verbs that end in . The rules for how this letter, and a preceding letter, should change when the subjunctive endings are applied are quite complicated, see the article Hungarian verbs.
As usual, gemination of a final sibilant consonant is demonstrated when a -initial ending is applied:
: + - gives &#x27;let me wash&#x27; ( changes to )

When referring to the demands of others, the subjunctive is demonstrated:
: &#x27;He asked that I go. (He asked me to go.)&#x27; Here, &quot;I go&quot; is in the subjunctive.

==Turkic languages==
===Turkish===
There is no one-to-one relationship between the subjunctive mode in other languages and the modes in Turkish. The subjunctive mode of other languages can be compared with the imperative mood (), the necessitative mood (), the optative mood (), desiderative mood (), conditional mood () in Turkish. Of the above 5 moods, 3 moods () are additionally translated as &quot;subjunctive mode&quot;.

Examples of the optative mood () are , , , and . Suggested actions and desires are expressed with the optative verb. The suffixes , , and other forms are used to form an optative verb. The Turkish optative means &#x27;let someone do something&#x27; in English. Forming the optative: 
# The suffix . The suffix or is used for the singular form of the first person according to the last vowel of the verb and it means &#x27;let me do&#x27;. Use the suffix if the last vowel of the word is . Use the suffix if the last vowel of the word is . If the verb root ends in a vowel the letter is added after the verb root: ; .
# The suffix . The suffix or is used for the plural form of the first person according to the last vowel of the verb and it means &#x27;let us do&#x27;. Use the suffix if the last vowel of the word is . Use the suffix if the last vowel of the word is . 

An example of a conditional mode () is , .

An examples of a necessitative mood () is: , 

An example of an imperative mode () is , .

An examples of a desiderative mood () is ; ; ; ; ;

<text>The Kappa Alpha Society (), founded in 1825, was the progenitor of the modern fraternity system in North America. It is considered to be the oldest national, secret, Greek-letter social fraternity and was the first of the fraternities which would eventually become known as the Union Triad that pioneered the North American system of social fraternities.

While several fraternities claim to be the oldest, Baird&#x27;s Manual states that has maintained a continuous existence since its foundation, making it the oldest undergraduate fraternity that exists today. As of 2022, there are five active chapters in the United States and Canada.

==History==
In 1823, John Hart Hunter, Isaac W. Jackson, and Thomas Hun, who were students at Union College in Schenectady, New York, established an informal group called The Philosophers. That group became the Kappa Alpha Society on . Its founders were Joseph Anthony Constant, John Hart Hunter, Isaac W. Jackson, Thomas Hun, John McGeoch, Orlando Meads, and James Proudfit of the class of , and Arthur Burtis and Joseph Law of the class of .

The Kappa Alpha Society represents the middle link between secret societies, literary societies, and Greek-letter organizations like Phi Beta Kappa. In the words of founding member Arthur Burtis:

KA expanded to Williams College in 1833, with fourteen pledges led by Azariah S. Clark of the class of 1834. Other chapters were established in the 19th century at Hobart College, Princeton College, the University of Virginia, Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Lehigh University, and McGill University. Chapters were established at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Western Ontario, Wesleyan University, the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, and Dalhousie University in the 20th century. The Union and Wesleyan chapters were co-educational (male and female members) in the recent past. There are currently no co-educational chapters.

==Chapters==
Following is a list of the active and inactive chapters of the Kappa Alpha Society. Active groups indicated in bold, inactive groups indicated by &quot;italics&quot;. Chapters are designated with an abbreviation of the institution&#x27;s Latin name. This organization is not to be confused with the Kappa Alpha Order, a completely separate national fraternity.

=== Notes ===
== Notable members ==

The Kappa Alpha Society has produced a substantial number of notable members in widely varied fields throughout its nearly 200-year history.

<doc id="287916" wikidata="Q179558" url="?curid=287916" title="Alexandra Kollontai">
<text>Alexandra Mikhailovna Kollontai (; , ; – 9 March 1952) was a Russian revolutionary, politician, diplomat and Marxist theoretician. Serving as the People&#x27;s Commissar for Welfare in Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s government in 1917–1918, she was a highly prominent woman within the Bolshevik party. She was the first woman in history to be a cabinet minister, and the first woman ambassador.

The daughter of an Imperial Russian Army general, Kollontai embraced radical politics in the 1890s and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1899. During the RSDLP ideological split, she sided with Julius Martov&#x27;s Mensheviks against Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks. Exiled from Russia in 1908, Kollontai toured Western Europe and the United States and campaigned against participation in the First World War. In 1915, she broke with the Mensheviks and became a member of the Bolsheviks.

Following the 1917 February Revolution which ousted the tsar, Kollontai returned to Russia. She supported Lenin&#x27;s radical proposals and, as a member of the party&#x27;s Central Committee, voted for the policy of armed uprising which led to the October Revolution and the fall of Alexander Kerensky&#x27;s Provisional Government. She was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for Social Welfare in the first Soviet government, but soon resigned due to her opposition to the peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk in the ranks of the Left Communists.

In 1919, Kollontai was a leading figure in the foundation of the Zhenotdel, the then-new women&#x27;s department of the Central Committee that was aimed at improving the status of women in the Soviet Union. She was a champion of women&#x27;s liberation, and later came to be recognized as a key figure in Marxist feminism.

Kollontai was outspoken against bureaucratic influences over the Communist Party and its undemocratic internal practices. To that end, she sided with the left-wing Workers&#x27; Opposition in 1920, but was eventually defeated and sidelined, narrowly avoiding her own expulsion from the party altogether. From 1922 on, she was appointed to various diplomatic posts abroad, serving in Norway, Mexico and Sweden. In 1943, she was promoted to the title of ambassador to Sweden. Kollontai retired from diplomatic service in 1945 and died in Moscow in 1952.

Kollontai&#x27;s father, General Mikhail Alekseyevich Domontovich (1830–1902), descended from a Ukrainian family that traced its ancestry back to the 13th century and Daumantas of Pskov. Her father served as a cavalry officer in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). After his participation in the war, he was appointed Provisional Governor of the Bulgarian city of Tarnovo, and later Military Consul in Sofia. In May 1879, he was called back to St. Petersburg. He entertained liberal political views, favouring a constitutional monarchy like that of United Kingdom. In the 1880s he wrote a study of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. This study was confiscated by the Tsarist censors, presumably for showing insufficient Russian nationalist zeal. Alexandra&#x27;s mother, Alexandra Alexandrovna Masalina (Massalina) (1848–1899), was the daughter of Alexander Feodorovich Masalin (Massalin) (1809–1859), a Finnish peasant who had made a fortune selling wood. Alexandra Alexandrovna Masalina became known as Alexandra Alexandrovna Masalina-Mravinskaya after her marriage to her first husband, Konstantin Iosipovich Mravinsky (originally spelled Mrovinsky) (1829–1921). Her marriage to Mravinsky was an arranged marriage which turned out to be unhappy, and eventually she divorced Mravinsky in order to marry Mikhail Domontovich, with whom she had fallen in love. Russian opera singer Yevgeniya Mravina (stage name) was Kollontai&#x27;s half-sister via her mother. The celebrated Soviet-Russian conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky, music director of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra for fifty years (1938–1988), was the only son of Mravina&#x27;s brother Alexander Kostantinovich and thus Kollontai&#x27;s half nephew.

The saga of her parents&#x27; long and difficult struggle to be together in spite of the norms of society would color and inform Alexandra Kollontai&#x27;s own views of relationships, sex, and marriage.

=== Early life ===
Alexandra Mikhailovna Domontovich was born on in St. Petersburg. &quot;Shura&quot;, as she was called growing up, was close to her father, with whom she shared an analytical bent and an interest in history and politics. Her relationship with her mother, for whom she was named, was more complex. She later recalled:

Alexandra was a good student growing up, sharing her father&#x27;s interest in history, and mastering a range of languages. She spoke French with her mother and sisters, English with her nanny, Finnish with the peasants at a family estate inherited from her maternal grandfather in Kuusa (in Muolaa, Grand Duchy of Finland), and was a student of German. Alexandra sought to continue her schooling at a university, but her mother refused her permission, arguing that women had no real need for higher education, and that impressionable youngsters encountered too many dangerous radical ideas at universities. Instead, Alexandra was to be allowed to take an exam to gain certification as a school teacher before making her way into society to find a husband, as was the custom.

In 1890 or 1891, Alexandra, aged around 19, met her cousin and future husband, Vladimir Ludvigovich Kollontai (9 July 1867 – July/August 1917), an engineering student of modest means enrolled at a military institute. Alexandra&#x27;s mother objected bitterly to the potential union since the young man was so poor, to which her daughter replied that she would work as a teacher to help make ends meet. Her mother bitterly scoffed at the notion:


Her parents forbade the relationship and sent Alexandra on a tour of Western Europe in the hope that she would forget Vladimir, but the pair remained committed to one another despite it all and married in 1893. Alexandra became pregnant soon after her marriage and bore a son, Mikhail, in 1894. She devoted her time to reading radical populist and Marxist political literature and writing fiction.

=== Early political activism ===

While Kollontai was initially drawn to the populist ideas of restructuring society based upon the Mir commune, she soon abandoned this for other revolutionary projects. Marxism, with its emphasis on the class consciousness of factory workers, the revolutionary seizure of power, and the construction of modern industrial society, attracted Kollontai and many of her peers in Russia&#x27;s radical intelligentsia. Kollontai&#x27;s first activities were timid and modest, helping out a few hours a week with her sister Zhenia at a library that supported Sunday classes in basic literacy for urban workers, sneaking a few socialist ideas into the lessons. Through this library Kollontai met Elena Stasova, an activist in the budding Marxist movement in St. Petersburg. Stasova began to use Kollontai as a courier, transporting parcels of illegal writings to unknown individuals, which were delivered upon utterance of a password.

Years later, she wrote about her marriage, &quot;We separated although we were in love because I felt trapped. I was detached, [from Vladimir], because of the revolutionary upsettings rooted in Russia.&quot; In 1898 she left little Mikhail with her parents to study economics in Zürich, Switzerland, with Professor Heinrich Herkner. She then paid a visit to England, where she met members of the British socialist movement, including Sidney and Beatrice Webb. She returned to Russia in 1899, at which time she met Vladimir Ilych Ulyanov, better known today as Vladimir Lenin.

Kollontai became interested in Marxist ideas while studying the history of working movements in Zürich, under Herkner, later described by her as a Marxist Revisionist.

She became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1899 at the age of 27. In 1905, Kollontai was a witness to the series of events in Saint Petersburg, known as Bloody Sunday, where tsarist soldiers opened fire on unarmed demonstrators in front of the Winter Palace causing hundreds of deaths and injuries. At the time of the split in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party between the Mensheviks under Julius Martov and the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin in 1903, Kollontai did not side with either faction at first, and &quot;offered her services to both factions&quot;. In 1906, however, disapproving of &quot;the hostile position taken by the Bolsheviks towards the Duma&quot; and despite her being generally a left-winger, she decided to join the Mensheviks.

She went into exile, to Germany, in 1908 after publishing &quot;Finland and Socialism&quot;, which called on the Finnish people to rise up against oppression within the Russian Empire. She traveled across western Europe and became acquainted with Karl Kautsky, Clara Zetkin, Rosa Luxemburg, and Karl Liebknecht, among others.

 In 1911, while abruptly breaking off her long-term relationship with her faction comrade Peter Maslov (1867–1946), an agrarian scientist, she started a love affair with another fellow exile, Alexander Gavrilovich Shliapnikov. The couple appeared quite oddly assorted: she was a Menshevik intellectual, of noble origins, thirteen years older than him; he was a self-taught metalworker from provincial Russia and a Bolshevik leading exponent of some prominence. Their romantic relationship came to an end in July 1916, but evolved thereafter into a long-lasting friendship as they wound up sharing many of the same general political views. They were still in contact in the early 1930s when Kollontai lived abroad in a sort of diplomatic exile, and Shliapnikov was going to be executed during the Soviet purges.

With Russian entry into World War I in 1914, Kollontai left Germany due to the German social democrats&#x27; support of the war. Kollontai was strongly opposed to the war and very outspoken against it, and in June 1915 she broke with the Mensheviks and officially joined the Bolsheviks, &quot;those who most consistently fought social-patriotism&quot;. After leaving Germany, Kollontai traveled to Denmark, only to discover that the Danish social democrats also supported the war. The next place where Kollontai tried to speak and write against the war was Sweden, but the Swedish government imprisoned her for her activities. After her release, Kollontai traveled to Norway, where she at last found a socialist community that was receptive to her ideas. Kollontai stayed primarily in Norway until 1917. She travelled twice to the United States to speak about war and politics, and to renew her relationship with her son Mikhail; in 1916, she had arranged for him to avoid conscription by going to the United States to work on Russian orders from U.S. factories. In 1917, upon hearing of the February Revolution, Kollontai returned from Norway to Russia.

=== Russian Revolution ===

When Lenin too got back to Russia in April 1917, Kollontai was the only major leader of the Petrograd Bolsheviks who immediately voiced her full support for his radical and nonconformist new proposals (the so-called &quot;April theses&quot;). She was a member of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, and &quot;for the rest of 1917, [she] was a constant agitator for revolution in Russia as a speaker, leaflet writer and worker on the Bolshevik women&#x27;s paper &quot;Rabotnitsa&quot;&quot;. Following the July uprising against the Provisional Government, she was arrested along with many other Bolshevik leaders, but was given again her full freedom of movement in September: she was then a member of the party&#x27;s Central Committee and as such she voted for the policy of armed uprising that led to the October Revolution. At the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 26 October, she was elected People&#x27;s Commissar for Social Welfare in the first Soviet government, but she soon resigned in opposition to the Brest-Litovsk Peace. During the revolutionary period, at the age of 45, she married 28-year-old revolutionary sailor Pavel Dybenko, while keeping her surname from her first marriage.

She was the most prominent woman in the Soviet administration and was best known for founding the Zhenotdel or &quot;Women&#x27;s Department&quot; in 1919 . This organization worked to improve the conditions of women&#x27;s lives in the Soviet Union, fighting illiteracy and educating women about the new marriage, education, and work laws put in place by the Revolution. It was eventually closed in 1930.

In political life, Kollontai increasingly became an internal critic of the Communist Party and, with an article published in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 28 January 1921, she publicly sided with the Workers&#x27; Opposition, a left-wing faction of the party that had its roots in the trade union milieu and was led by Shliapnikov and by Sergei Medvedev, both of working class extraction. Three days earlier, on 25 January, after about a month delay, &quot;Pravda&quot; finally published the faction&#x27;s platform for the upcoming Tenth Party Congress: it mainly advocated unionized workers&#x27; control over factories and generally over &quot;the management of the national economy&quot;, on the grounds that the construction of a communist society could only be carried out by the industrial proletariat through its class work in history and through the intelligence it would acquire in concrete economic experience.

In the run-up to the congress, scheduled for 8–16 March, at Shliapnikov&#x27;s urgent request, Kollontai had a pamphlet printed with the title of &quot;The Workers&#x27; Opposition&quot;: it expounded her personal views on the subjects under discussion, was intended to be distributed only to the delegates and has since remained probably her most famous work. &quot;Kollontai&#x27;s propositions for reform mostly repeated those enumerated by the Workers&#x27; Opposition, but she placed a greater emphasis on reducing &#x27;bureaucratisation&#x27;,&quot; and denouncing petty-bourgeois or non-proletarian influences on Soviet institutions and on the party. Her language &quot;conveyed much harsher criticism of the party and CC than did Shlyapnikov&#x27;s language&quot; in the official faction platform. Lenin was very upset about Kollontai joining the Workers&#x27; Opposition and, when he was given a copy of her pamphlet, he just &#x27;leafed through&#x27; it and immediately castigated Kollontai. He stated she had written &#x27;the platform of a new party&#x27;, threatened to submit her pamphlet to the court of the Communist International, and said clearly to her face: &quot;For this you should not only be excluded, but shot as well.&quot;

The followers of the faction among the delegates, however, remained quite few and proved to be declining during the proceedings, when Lenin did not even hesitate to draw snickers from delegates by hinting at the amatory past of the Kollontai-Shliapnikov couple. Although Kollontai and her comrades had promptly and unconditionally sided against the Kronstadt rebels, on the last day the congress passed, among others, two secret resolutions: one, specially aimed at the Workers&#x27; Opposition, condemned &#x27;Anarcho-syndicalist deviation&#x27; within the party; the other (&#x27;On party unity&#x27;) simply banned all factions. Thus, the Workers&#x27; Opposition was forcibly dissolved, and Kollontai was practically sidelined.

Nevertheless, despite subsequent misunderstandings with the former leaders of the Workers&#x27; Opposition and Kollontai&#x27;s own resentment at their having renounced the pamphlet she had written to support the faction, on 5 July 1921 she tried again &quot;to help [them] by speaking on their behalf to the Third Congress of the Comintern&quot;. In her speech, she bitterly attacked the New Economic Policy proposed by Lenin, warning that it &#x27;threatened to disillusion workers, to strengthen the peasantry and petty bourgeoisie, and to facilitate the rebirth of capitalism&#x27;. Trotsky retorted by even likening her to &quot;an Amazon&quot;, and Karl Radek loudly corrected: &quot;Like a Valkyrie!&quot;

Kollontai&#x27;s final political action as an oppositionist within the Communist Party was her co-signing of the so-called &quot;letter of the Twenty Two&quot;, whereby several former members of the Workers&#x27; Opposition and other party members of working class origin appealed to the Communist International against the undemocratic internal practices in use within the Russian party. When &#x27;Kollontai attempted to speak before the Comintern Executive on 26 February 1922 on behalf of the views expressed in the appeal,&#x27; Trotsky and Zinoviev had her name removed from the list of orators and insisted that she should not take the floor. When she &#x27;proved recalcitrant, Trotsky forbade her to speak and issued a decree, in the name of the CC, ordering all members of the Russian delegation to &quot;obey the directives of the party&quot;.&#x27; Predictably, the appeal of the 22 was unsuccessful. At the Eleventh Party Congress (March–April 1922), Kollontai, Shlyapnikov and Medvedev were charged with having insisted on factional work and a three-man commission, Stalin, Zinoviev and Dzerzhinsky, recommended the &quot;unrepentant&quot; three be purged from the party. In her defensive speech before the Congress, Kollontai emphasized her loyalty to the party and her devotion to giving the leading role in the party and outside it to the working class, she proclaimed her full observance of the previous year&#x27;s decree on party unity, and concluded: &quot;If there is no place for this in our party, then exclude me. But even outside the ranks of our party, I will live, work and fight for the Communist party.&quot; Eventually, a resolution was passed allowing the three to remain in the party unless they committed further violations of its discipline.

=== Soviet diplomatic career ===

After the Eleventh Congress, Kollontai became a political outcast. She was badly shaken by having teetered dangerously close to expulsion, and regarded the idea of being excluded from the &#x27;revolutionary community of the elect&#x27; as a dreadful &quot;nightmare&quot;. She even speculated she might be arrested. Italian writer and former communist leader Ignazio Silone later recounted that, on his departure from Moscow in 1922, Kollontai jokingly warned him not to believe any news of her being arrested for stealing Kremlin silverware, for such news could only mean that she was &quot;not entirely in agreement with [Lenin] about some little problem of agricultural or industrial policy.&quot;

During this time, Kollontai was also in the process of a painful divorce from her second husband, Pavel Dybenko, which made her want a change of scenery. In the latter half of 1922 she wrote a &quot;personal letter&quot; to the newly appointed General Secretary of the Central Committee and her recent inquisitor, Joseph Stalin, asking to be sent on a mission abroad. Stalin granted her request and, starting from October 1922, she began to be entrusted with diplomatic appointments abroad and was thus prevented from playing any further political role at home. At first she hoped it was just a passing phase in her life and that she would soon return to her political work in the Zhenotdel, but eventually she had to realize that the diplomatic assignment had become a sort of exile.

Initially, she was sent as an attaché to the Soviet commercial mission in Norway, becoming one of the first women serving in diplomacy in modern times. In early 1924, Kollontai was first promoted to &quot;Chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; and from August to Minister Plenipotentiary. As such, she later served in Mexico (1926–27), again in Norway (1927–30) and eventually in Sweden (1930–45), where she was finally promoted to Ambassador in 1943. She was also a member of the Soviet delegation to the League of Nations.

When Kollontai was in Stockholm, the Winter War between Russia and Finland broke out; it has been said that it was largely due to her influence that Sweden remained neutral. After the war, she received Vyacheslav Molotov&#x27;s praises. During late April 1943, Kollontai may have been involved in abortive peace negotiations with Hans Thomsen, her German counterpart in Stockholm. Kollontai was cared for by her friend, Swedish doctor Ada Nilsson as her health began to fail and retired in 1945. 

In 1946 and 1947 she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Scandinavian political circles, including the Finnish president and erstwhile Envoy to Moscow, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, on the grounds of &quot;her diplomatic efforts to end war and hostilities between the Soviet Union and Finland during the negotiations in 1940-44.&quot;

=== Political retreat and attitude toward Stalinism ===
Being sent abroad in a sort of &quot;de facto&quot; exile for over twenty years, Kollontai gave up &quot;her fight for reform and for women, retreating into relative obscurity&quot; and bowing to the new political climate. She discarded her feminist concerns and &quot;offered no objection to the patriarchal legislation of 1926 and the constitution of 1936, which deprived Soviet women of many of the gains they had achieved after the February and October Revolutions&quot;. The following words she allegedly pronounced in a private conversation with her friend in 1929 give a suggestion of her attitude towards advancing Stalinism: &quot;Everything&#x27;s changed so much. What can I do about this? One cannot go against the &#x27;apparatus&#x27;. For my part, I have put my principles aside in a corner of my conscience and I pursue as best I can the policies they dictate to me&quot;.

Three years earlier, in 1926, when she was requested to write her own autobiography for a series on famous women by Munich publisher Helga Kern, she deemed it necessary to completely revise the first draft of her work she had handed over to the publisher, by deleting practically all references to &#x27;dangerous&#x27; topics, as well as the parts mentioning or just hinting at her former critical positions and those having a personal nature that might be regarded as forms of self-celebration. On asking the publisher to make the changes requested, Kollontai apologized with obvious embarrassment, inviting repeatedly to debit her all expenses and writing twice that, under current circumstances, it was not absolutely possible &quot;to do otherwise&quot;.

In his memoirs, Leon Trotsky was contemptuously critical of Kollontai&#x27;s political attitude, writing that &#x27;In Russia, Kolontay took from the very first an ultra-left stand, not only toward me but toward Lenin as well. She waged many a battle against the &quot;Lenin-Trotsky&quot; regime, only to bow most movingly later on to the Stalin regime.&#x27; Yet, it could also be argued that she had just internalized for good the lesson Trotsky had taught her at the aforementioned 1922 meeting of the Comintern, when he had tamed her last remnants of recalcitrance, forcing her into bowing to party discipline. Kollontai had, as it were, countered in advance, in her 1927 article through which she finally aligned herself, once and for all, with the Stalinists:
The degree of her adherence to the prevailing ideas of the Stalinist regime, whether it was spontaneous or not, may be gauged from the opening of an article she wrote in 1946 for a Russian magazine. It bore the title &quot;The Soviet Woman — a Full and Equal Citizen of Her Country&quot;, and praised the Soviet Union&#x27;s advances of women&#x27;s rights, while simultaneously emphasizing a view of the role of women in society at odds with her previous writings on women&#x27;s liberation.

=== Death and legacy ===
Alexandra Kollontai died in Moscow on 9 March 1952, less than a month from her 80th birthday, and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery.

She was the only member of the Bolsheviks&#x27; Central Committee that had led the October Revolution who managed to live into the 1950s, other than Stalin and his devoted supporter Matvei Muranov. She has sometimes been criticized and even held up to contempt for not raising her voice during the Stalinist purges, when, among countless others, her former husband, her former lover and fighting comrade, and so many friends of hers were executed. And, it has been noted, at the time she &quot;was safe in her sumptuous Stockholm residence&quot;. Notwithstanding, it should also be pointed out that, even so, Kollontai did not enjoy a full liberty of action and had to worry about the possible fates of her family. It might not have been pure chance if both her only son and her musician half-nephew (whom she had much supported at the beginning of his career) also came unscathed through the persecution of the Stalinist regime, to the establishment of which she had, however, significantly contributed.

The resurgence of radicalism in the 1960s and the growth of the feminist movement in the 1970s spurred a new interest in the life and writings of Alexandra Kollontai all around the world. A spate of books and pamphlets by and about Kollontai were subsequently published, including full-length biographies by historians Cathy Porter, Beatrice Farnsworth, and Barbara Evans Clements. In 1982 Rosa von Praunheim made the film &quot;Red Love&quot; based on the novella with the same title by Kollontai. For example, the film was shown in the Museum of Modern Art. Kollontai was the subject of the 1994 TV film, &quot;A Wave of Passion: The Life of Alexandra Kollontai,&quot; with Glenda Jackson as the voice of Kollontai. A female Soviet diplomat in the 1930s with unconventional views on sexuality, probably inspired by Kollontai, had been played by Greta Garbo in the movie &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939).

== Contributions to Marxist feminism ==

Kollontai is regarded as a key figure in Marxist feminism for her commitment both to women&#x27;s liberation and Marxist ideals. She opposed the ideology of liberal feminism, which she saw as bourgeois. At the same time, Kollontai was a champion of women&#x27;s liberation, believing that it &quot;could take place only as the result of the victory of a new social order and a different economic system&quot;. She criticized bourgeois feminists for prioritizing political goals, such as women&#x27;s suffrage, that would provide political equality for bourgeois women but would do little to address the immediate conditions of working-class women, and was further distrustful that bourgeois champions of feminism would continue to support their working class counterparts after succeeding in their struggle for &quot;general women&#x27;s&quot; rights:

Kollontai is known for her advocacy of free love. However, this does not mean that she advocated casual sexual encounters; indeed, she believed that due to the inequality between men and women that persisted under socialism, such encounters would lead to women being exploited, and being left to raise children alone. Instead she believed that true socialism could not be achieved without a radical change in attitudes to sexuality, so that it might be freed from the oppressive norms that she saw as a continuation of bourgeois ideas about property. A common myth describes her as a proponent of the &quot;glass of water&quot; theory of sexuality. The quote &quot;...the satisfaction of one&#x27;s sexual desires should be as simple as getting a glass of water&quot; is often mistakenly attributed to her. This is likely a distortion of the moment in her short story &quot;Three Generations&quot; when a young female Komsomol member argues that sex &quot;is as meaningless as drinking a glass of vodka [or water, depending on the translation] to quench one&#x27;s thirst.&quot; In number 18 of her &quot;Theses on Communist Morality in the Sphere of Marital Relations,&quot; Kollontai argued that &quot;...sexuality is a human instinct as natural as hunger or thirst.&quot;

Though Kollontai believed in the eventual obsolescence of the traditional family, she held that institution marriage could survive if it underwent a radical transformation. She advocated for a transformed marriage that would be compatible with many other social relations, such as friendship. Kollontai felt that by liberating women and men from their traditionally hierarchical roles, communism would free marriage from the &quot;conjugal slavery of the past&quot;, allowing spouses to thrive in egalitarian marriages grounded in mutual love and trust. As Kollontai wrote in 1920:The workers&#x27; state needs new relations between the sexes, just as the narrow and exclusive affection of the mother for her own children must expand until it extends to all the children of the great, proletarian family, the indissoluble marriage based on the servitude of women is replaced by a free union of two equal members of the workers&#x27; state who are united by love and mutual respect. In place of the individual and egoistic family, a great universal family of workers will develop, in which all the workers, men and women, will above all be comrades. – Alexandra Kollontai (1920), &quot;Communism and the Family&quot;Kollontai&#x27;s saw domestic labour as an impediment to her ideal of the &quot;universal family&quot;. Rather than viewing the tasks that were traditionally reserved for women as productive labour, Kollontai believed that housework stood in the way of industrialization and modernization and that under a fully realized communist society, industrial mechanization would ultimately replace so-called women&#x27;s work:All that was formerly produced in the bosom of the family is now being manufactured on a mass scale in workshops and factories. The machine has superseded the wife. What house- keeper would now bother to make candles, spin wool or weave cloth? All these products can be bought in the shop next door. Formerly every girl would learn to knit stockings. Nowa- days, what working woman would think of making her own? In the first place she doesn&#x27;t have the time. Time is money, and no one wants to waste time in an unproductive and useless manner. Few working women would start to pickle cucumbers or make other preserves when all these things can be bought in the shop. – Alexandra Kollontai (1920), &quot;Communism and the Family&quot; In this regard, Kollontai&#x27;s critique of women&#x27;s societal position under capitalism is both reminiscent of and distinct from the Marxist feminist Wages for Housework movement. While proponents of Wages for Housework argue that the domestic labour is productive labour worthy of monetary compensation, Kollontai devalued &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;, believing it to be an antiquated vestige of the past. Unlike supporters of Wages for Housework who advocated for the integration of women into the public sphere, Kollontai questioned the status of working women:

Kollontai&#x27;s views on the role of marriage and the family under Communism were arguably more influential than her advocacy of &quot;free love&quot;. Kollontai believed that, like the state, the family unit would wither away once the second stage of communism became a reality. She viewed marriage and traditional families as legacies of an oppressive, property-rights-based, and individualistic past in which women were simultaneously subjected to both wage labour outside the home and unpaid maternal and domestic labour within it. Kollontai admonished men and women to discard their nostalgia for traditional family life. &quot;The worker-mother must learn not to differentiate between yours and mine; she must remember that there are only our children, the children of Russia&#x27;s communist workers.&quot; Under Communism, both men and women would work for, and be supported by, society, not their families. Similarly, their children would be wards of society, raised in common. However, she also praised parental attachment: &quot;Communist society will take upon itself all the duties involved in the education of the child, but the joys of parenthood will not be taken away from those who are capable of appreciating them.&quot;

<text>Surfacing is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, released on 15 July 1997. It was produced by McLachlan&#x27;s frequent collaborator, Pierre Marchand, and its release coincided with the start of McLachlan&#x27;s Lilith Fair tour. The album reached the top position on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Albums chart, number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and became her first album to reach the top 50 outside of North America, achieving that in the UK, Australia and the Netherlands. It was certified as Diamond in sales in Canada and as 8× Platinum in sales in the US. Critical reviews were mixed; some of the more positive reviews praised the songwriting, while the album&#x27;s detractors criticized it as banal and slow.

The album spawned three top-three hits on the Canadian Singles Chart, including &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;, which spent eight weeks at number one, &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;, which reached number two, and &quot;Adia&quot; which ascended to number three. The fourth single &quot;Angel&quot; peaked at number nine, but did reach number three on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart, something the other three singles also achieved. Two of the songs, &quot;Adia&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; were US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-five hits (the latter also peaking at number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart) while &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; was a top-15 hit and &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; was a top-30 hit. &quot;Adia&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; became her first songs to reach the top 40 in some countries outside of North America.

The album won four Juno Awards including for Album of the Year. &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, while the instrumental-only song &quot;Last Dance&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

==Background==
Following the 1993 release of her third album and U.S. breakthrough, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, McLachlan spent two and a half years touring. This long period on the road finished in January 1996; over this time, the album slowly became a hit record. Work on the follow-up was scheduled to begin in April of that year, but McLachlan found herself mentally exhausted at the time, later claiming that she had personally wanted &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; to be her final record. She spent time working in the studio in Quebec but struggled to produce anything for her new album. At her manager&#x27;s suggestion, she returned home to Vancouver and took six months off. She said that after this break—and some time spent in therapy—she began to feel more in control of her creativity and started writing material for the album.

One of the first songs written for the album was the hit single &quot;Angel&quot;. McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, and &quot;a real joyous occasion.&quot; It was inspired by articles that she read in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about musicians who turned to heroin to cope with the pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: &quot;I&#x27;ve been in that place where you&#x27;re so fucked up and you&#x27;re so lost that you don&#x27;t know who you are anymore, and you&#x27;re miserable—and here&#x27;s this escape route. I&#x27;ve never done heroin, but I&#x27;ve done plenty of other things to escape.&quot; She said that the song is about &quot;trying not to take responsibility for other people&#x27;s shit and trying to love yourself at the same time.&quot; Another song that she found easy to write was &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;, co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up with the rest of the lyrics together, according to McLachlan, &quot;pretty darn quickly.&quot; When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, &quot;I was so happy when I could let it go. I didn&#x27;t give it another thought when it was done.&quot;

==Recording and release==
Like most of McLachlan&#x27;s albums, &quot;Surfacing&quot; was recorded at Marchand&#x27;s Wild Sky Studios in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Marchand, who produced, engineered, and mixed the album, recorded it on an Otari RADAR recorder and a Neumann 149 microphone. McLachlan played piano, acoustic guitar, and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards, bass, and a drum machine as well as providing background vocals. The other musicians on the album were Jim Creeggan on upright bass, on guitar, musical saw, lap steel guitar and slide bass, Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar, Michel Pepin on electric guitar, and Ashwin Sood (whom McLachlan married in 1997) on percussion and drums.

The album was released on 15 July 1997, on Nettwerk and Arista Records, debuting at No. 1 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Albums chart, its lone week on top of the chart. It peaked at No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also reached the top 15 in New Zealand, the top 40 in Australia, and the top 50 in the UK and the Netherlands, her first album to chart in all of those countries. The release of the album coincided with the inaugural tour of McLachlan&#x27;s Lilith Fair in mid-1997.

The first single from the album was &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;, released on 9 June 1997; it spent eight weeks at number one on the Canadian singles chart, placing as the number one single of the year; it also topped the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart. It rose to number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; was released in late 1997 and reached number two on the Canadian Singles and Adult Contemporary Charts and number 28 on the US Hot 100. The third single released from the album was &quot;Adia&quot;, released on 2 March 1998. It peaked at number three on both the Canadian Singles Chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, also reaching the top 20 in the UK, her first top-20 hit outside of North America. It also topped the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart while peaking at number five on the US Adult Contemporary Chart, her first single to achieve that. &quot;Angel&quot;, released on 28 September 1998, served as the album&#x27;s final single, reaching number nine in Canada, number four on the Hot 100, the top 10 in Norway (her first top 10 hit outside of North America), the top 20 in Switzerland and Austria, and the top 40 in the UK, the Netherlands and New Zealand (her first hit in all these countries except for the UK). &quot;Angel&quot; was especially successful on the US Adult Contemporary Chart spending 12 weeks at number one, finishing 1999 as the number one Adult Contemporary song of the year, while also ascending to number three on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart. &quot;I Love You&quot; rose to number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs in April 2000.

==Critical reception==

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sia Michel called the album &quot;lushly atmospheric&quot; but also ambivalent. She said that while the album paints a &quot;vivid emotional landscape&quot;, it is at odds with McLachlan&#x27;s statement that the album was about &quot;&#x27;facing ugly things&#x27; about herself&quot;; not revealing anything particularly dark. Michel also noted certain old-fashioned ideas in the album, particularly in &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;, that contrast with the work of contemporaries such as Ani DiFranco and PJ Harvey. She cited &quot;Witness&quot; as the highlight and said of the album, &quot;[p]erhaps she hasn&#x27;t found what she&#x27;s looking for, but at least she&#x27;s trying.&quot; Elysa Gardner of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said it &quot;showcases her considerable strengths—a shimmering soprano voice and a knack for intelligent, emotionally forthright lyrics but also suffers from a lack of compelling craftsmanship and textural daring.&quot;

Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that although he had stayed away from McLachlan&#x27;s music in the past, &quot;between her Lilith Fair counterpalooza and &#x27;Building a Mystery&#x27; bonanza, [he] had to dive in, and got less than [he&#x27;d] bargained for.&quot; He criticized McLachlan&#x27;s &quot;monumental banality&quot; and summed the album up as &quot;renormalized pop at its most unnecessary.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the album&#x27;s slow tempo, commenting that &quot;if you want a piece of her nirvana, you have to go along at her protracted, glacial pace.&quot; They said that McLachlan is too &quot;rigid in her introspection&quot; and that they would like to hear her &quot;work up a good head of steam&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine compared it unfavorably to McLachlan&#x27;s previous album &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;. He said that some of the songs were good, and praised &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; in particular, but said that the album offered nothing new. He also noted that the timing of the release, coinciding with the launch of Lilith Fair and the publicity that McLachlan received from that, helped sales of the album. Jom, a staff reviewer for Sputnikmusic, gave the album a positive review, calling it &quot;one of [McLachlan&#x27;s] best albums&quot; and praising her &quot;tremendous growth as a songwriter and a musician&quot;. In interviews, American hip hop artist Darryl McDaniels of Run-D.M.C. has said that hearing &quot;Angel&quot; on the radio, and subsequently listening to more of McLachlan&#x27;s music, helped him though a period of depression.

===Starr report===
The album was mentioned in the Starr Report, the late 1990s account of Independent Counsel Ken Starr&#x27;s investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. After a visit to the White House in November 1997, Lewinsky wrote that she &quot;noticed you (President Clinton) had the new Sarah
McLachlan CD&quot; and that &quot;whenever I listen to song No. 5 (&quot;Do What You Have to Do&quot;), I think of you.&quot; McLachlan&#x27;s representatives had no comment on the matter.

===Awards===
At the Juno Awards of 1998, McLachlan won four awards: Best Female Vocalist, Songwriter of the Year (with Pierre Marchand, for &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;), Best Album (for &quot;Surfacing&quot;) and Single of the Year (for &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;). The following year, she did not win any awards, but was nominated for Single of the Year (for &quot;Adia&quot;) and Best Video (for &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;).

At the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998, McLachlan was nominated for three awards; she won the awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (for &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;) and Best Pop Instrumental Performance (for &quot;Last Dance&quot;). In 1999, she received one more nomination for the album, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (for &quot;Adia&quot;); she lost to Celine Dion.

<text>Tonlé Sap (; , ; or commonly translated as &#x27;Great Lake&#x27;) is a lake in the northwest of Cambodia. Belonging to the Mekong River system, Tonlé Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world. It has been designated as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1997 due to its high biodiversity. In the 21st century, the lake and its surrounding ecosystems are under increasing pressure from deforestation, infrastructure development and climate change.

==Geography==

Tonlé Sap Lake is located in the northwest of the lower Mekong plain, formed by the collision and collapse of the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The lower Mekong plain used to be a bay, and the sea level rose rapidly at the end of the last glacial period. About high, cores from this period found near Angkor contain tidal deposits, as well as salt marshes and mangrove swamp deposits, deposited in caves about 7,900-7,300 years ago The sediments of Lake Sap also show signs of marine influence. The current river morphology of the Mekong Delta was developed over the past 6,000 years, while the remaining waters in the northwest corner of the lower Mekong plain formed the Tonlé Sap.

==Hydrology==
The Tonlé Sap drainage basin is bordered to the southwest by the Cardamom Mountains, with heights of more than , and to the north are the Piandan Mountains with an average height of . The basin covers an area of . The -long Tonlé Sap River connects the Tonlé Sap Lake with the Mekong River and contributes 9% of the flow of the Mekong River. The size and water volume of the lake varies greatly throughout the year, with a minimum area of about and a volume of about in the dry season, and the water body expands in the rainy season, increasing the depth to . The maximum area is , and the volume is about .

About 34% of the water in the Tonlé Sap comes from the rivers that enter the lake, about 53.5% from the Mekong River, and 12.5% from precipitation. May to October is the rainy season in the lower Mekong plain, and November to March is the dry season. The annual rainfall is . Almost all the precipitation is in the rainy season. At the end of the dry season, the Tonlé Sap Lake has a typical depth of . As the monsoon rain begins, the water level of the river begins to rise, eventually reversing the flow of the river. The water level of the Tonlé Sap increases by about , the flow of the Mekong gradually decreases at the end of the rainy season, and the flow of the Tonlé Sap then reverses and begins to replenish the flow of the Mekong.

The extreme hydrodynamic complexity of the Tonlé Sap Lake, both in time and space, makes it impossible to measure specific flow, and water level rather than velocity and volume determines the movement of water as it shapes the landscape. 72% of the modern sediments deposited in the Tonlé Sap come from the Mekong River, while only 28% come from the catchments upstream of the lake. Sediment-bound phosphorus acts as the basis of the food chain through phytoplankton, and internal nutrient cycling plays a crucial role in the productivity of the floodplain and, therefore, the long-term sustainability of the lake&#x27;s entire ecosystem.

==Ecology==

The land cover of the Tonlé Sap Lake Basin is 55% of the forest land and 45% of the agricultural land. The lake is surrounded by freshwater mangroves known as &quot;flood forests&quot;, accounting for 3% of the basin area, and the floodplain is surrounded by low hills and covered with evergreen or deciduous seasonal tropical plants. The forest is dominated by Dipterocarpaceae, Leguminosae, Lacelandaceae, and in some places Pinaceae, Rohan pineaceae or bamboo. As the distance from the lake becomes farther and farther away, the forest gradually turns into a thicket, and finally into a meadow. In areas with higher quality soils or higher altitudes, deciduous mixed forests and semi-evergreen forests occur. This diversity of vegetation types underlies the species diversity of the Tonle Sap ecosystem, with interlocking forests, grasslands and swamps providing refuge for local wildlife.

The lake is home to at least 149 species of fish, 11 of which are globally endangered, and the lake area is also home to 6 near-threatened species, including spotted-billed, great bald, bengal, black-bellied, and Grey-headed fish eagle and Far Eastern reed, in addition to supporting reptile populations including the endangered Siamese crocodile and numerous freshwater snakes, and although much of the Lake District has been turned into farmland, 200 species of higher plants are still recorded. The Mekong giant catfish, which lives in the Tonlé Sap Lake, is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world. A fisherman caught a Mekong giant catfish weighing nearly 648 pounds in May 2004, but its population has been declining since the mid-1970s. It is currently illegal for fishermen to catch and retain Mekong giant catfish, and only a few are used for scientific research.

As a natural flood reservoir for the entire Mekong River system, Tonlé Sap Lake regulates floods in the lower reaches of Phnom Penh during the rainy season, and is also an important supplement to the dry season flow of the Mekong Delta. In 1997, UNESCO designated the Tonle Sap as a biosphere reserve, but scientists have been concerned that high dams built in southern China and Laos will affect the strength and flow of countercurrents into the Tonlé Sap, reducing the number of fish in the lake. Tonle Sap habitat for nesting, breeding, spawning, and foraging in the floodplain, which will adversely affect fish productivity and overall biodiversity in the Tonle Sap.

Forest loss hotspots are located in low floodplain areas where protected areas are located, significant farmland expansion is mainly in the intersection between the lower and upper floodplains, population growth, fuelwood gathering and logging are the main causes of forest loss, intensification of agricultural activities and upstream hydropower development reduces buffers to natural habitats and increases the risk of forest loss. By the 2030s, hydropower development may lead to large-scale changes in habitat, with the area of coastal forests likely to decrease by 82%, while the area of rain-fed habitats may increase by 10–13%. In July 2020, under the influence of the El Niño phenomenon and the impoundment of dams in the tributaries of the Mekong River, the water level of the Tonle Sap Lake hit a record low for the same period in the past 60 years.

==Fishery==

The Tonlé Sap Lake District has always been a vital fishing and agricultural production area for Cambodia, and it has largely maintained Angkor, the largest pre-industrial settlement complex in history. While many fish left lakes and ponds to spawn in flooded forests at the onset of floods, the inflow of Mekong floods brought large numbers of fry, which found shelter and food in flooded forests and floodplains.

The approximately 1.2 million people who live in the Tonlé Sap Lake area, which accounts for about 60% of Cambodia&#x27;s annual freshwater catch of over 400,000 tons, account for 60% of the country&#x27;s population&#x27;s protein intake. Most fish are eaten fresh, and savory and fermented fish paste Prahoc is usually marinated from the least popular fish or leftover fish that cannot be sold fresh. For more than a century, the most productive lake areas have been privatized through a government-lease system of fishing grounds, providing more than $2 million in tax revenue annually.
Since Buddhism is against killing, fishermen tend to limit their catch to what they can feed their families. They do not kill the fish with their own hands but wait for the fish to die naturally after they leave the water. At the end of the rice season, people restore canoes that have been in use for hundreds of years or build new canoes when they can&#x27;t be repaired in temples along the river, in preparation for the boating competition of the water festival. After two days of racing all the canoes come together to celebrate the Naga, the water serpent, who supposedly spit out the lake into the sea at the end of the rainy season, while bringing fish into the Mekong through the Tonlé Sap River.

The area is home to many Cambodians of Vietnamese origin who live in floating villages on boats by the lake. Most of the fishermen of Tonlé Sap Lake are of Vietnamese origin. They have lived in Cambodia for a long time and are the main suppliers of the country&#x27;s fishery market. They had to flee to Vietnam during the Khmer Rouge reigning era from 1975 to 1979. Only returned after the downfall of the regime and continued to fish in the Tonle Sap.

<text>The Anglican Province of Christ the King (APCK) is a Continuing Anglican church with traditional forms both of doctrine and liturgy. It is considered one of the more Anglo-Catholic jurisdictions among Continuing Anglican church bodies.

==History==

At the founding of the Continuing Anglican movement in 1977 at the Congress of St. Louis, a proposed constitution for a new Anglican church in North America was put before the four existing dioceses for ratification. The two which did ratify the constitution later adopted the name Anglican Catholic Church. The two which did not ratify because of concerns that the role of the new church&#x27;s bishops was overly narrow, elected to continue under the original name of the movement. One of these non-ratifying dioceses, the Diocese of the Southeastern States, dissolved within a short time leaving only the Diocese of Christ the King under its bishop ordinary, Robert Morse of California. In 1981, the Diocese of Christ the King reported 40 parishes across the United States, with more than 35 clergy. A new name, Province of Christ the King, was adopted as the church expanded to become a nationwide jurisdiction spanning the United States. The province was renamed as the Anglican Province of Christ the King in 1991.

On July 25, 2007, the bishop and most of the parishes in the Eastern Diocese of the APCK withdrew, joining the Anglican Church in America. However, four of its parishes decided to remain within the APCK.

On June 29, 2007, James E. Provence was elected as successor to Morse upon the latter&#x27;s retirement as archbishop of the province. Morse continued as provost of St. Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological Seminary which he was instrumental in founding in 1979. Provence was installed as Archbishop in 2008. He resigned on July 20, 2015 after allegations of misconduct. Frederick G. Morrison was elected to succeed him as archbishop. Morrison retired on January 1, 2020, and was replaced by Archbishop John E Upham. Upham had been consecrated a Suffragan Bishop of the Diocese of the Atlantic States on August 15, 2012. Archbishop Upham deceased in February, 2023.

On June 14th, 2023, Blair W. Schultz was elected as the fifth Archbishop of the Anglican Province of Christ the King. Archbishop Schultz was consecrated Bishop Suffragan of the Diocese of the Atlantic States in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on September 21, 2017, by The Most Reverend Frederick G. Morrison, The Right Reverend Donald M. Ashman, The (then) Right Reverend Doctor John E. Upham, and The Right Reverend Frank W. Brulc.

From 2003 to 2011, the Anglican Catholic Church (ACC), the Anglican Province of Christ the King (APCK), and the United Episcopal Church of North America (UECNA) explored opportunities for greater cooperation and the possibility of achieving organic unity. In 2003, Archbishop John-Charles Vockler of the ACC in a letter, called for prayers for healing of the damaged relations between the ACC and the APCK. In 2007 intercommunion was formally astablished between the APCK and the ACC and UECNA. In January 2009, one bishop from each jurisdiction consecrated three suffragan bishops in St. Louis, intending that they serve all three jurisdictions.

Archbishop Robert Morse died in 2015.

==Publications==
The publishing arm of the APCK is known as the American Church Union (ACU). The APCK publishes a newsletter called The Shepherd&#x27;s Staff.

==Parishes==

The APCK has over forty parishes across three dioceses organized geographically. Sixteen of its parishes are in California.

== Seminary ==
Saint Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological College was founded in 1979 as a seminary for the newly formed Diocese of Christ the King. It continues to offer classes, in person and online, mostly for prospective clergy of the APCK. It is located one block south of the University of California, Berkeley.

The college had originally been founded in 1952 by Robert S. Morse as the Episcopal Chaplaincy at Stanford University, with the St. Joseph of Arimathea Foundation established in 1960. In 1964 the current location was purchased. Due to disagreements between Robert S. Morse and the then Episcopal bishop, James Pike, in 1963 Morse resigned as Chairman but filled the Board with Orthodox and Catholic clergy, including Prince Vasili Romanov and the Very Rev. Alexander Schmemann. The St. Joseph’s Student Center hosted Orthodox, Catholic, and Anglican services throughout the week.

<doc id="287936" wikidata="Q435182" url="?curid=287936" title="Prince George, Duke of Cambridge">
<text>Prince George, Duke of Cambridge (George William Frederick Charles; 26 March 1819 – 17 March 1904) was a member of the British royal family, a grandson of King George III and cousin of Queen Victoria. The Duke was an army officer by profession and served as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces (military head of the British Army) from 1856 to 1895. He became Duke of Cambridge in 1850 and field marshal in 1862. Deeply devoted to the old Army, he worked with Queen Victoria to defeat or minimise every reform proposal, such as setting up a general staff. His Army&#x27;s weaknesses were dramatically revealed by the poor organisation at the start of the Second Boer War.

==Early life==

Prince George was born at Cambridge House, Hanover. His father was Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the seventh son of King George III and Queen Charlotte. His mother was the Duchess of Cambridge (née Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel).

He was baptised at Cambridge House in Hanover on 11 May 1819, by the Reverend John Sanford, his father&#x27;s Domestic Chaplain. His godparents were the Prince Regent (represented by the Duke of Clarence and St Andrews), the Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (represented by the 4th Earl of Mayo) and the Dowager Queen of Württemberg (represented by the Countess of Mayo).

==Military career==
Prince George of Cambridge was educated in Hanover and from 1830 in England by the Rev. J. R. Wood, a canon of Worcester Cathedral. Like his father, he embarked upon a military career, initially becoming a colonel in the Hanoverian Army and then, on 3 November 1837, becoming a brevet colonel in the British Army. He was attached to the staff at Gibraltar from October 1838 to April 1839. After serving in Ireland with the 12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales&#x27;s), he was appointed substantive lieutenant-colonel of the 8th Light Dragoons on 15 April 1842 and colonel of the 17th Lancers on 25 April 1842.

From 1843 to 1845 he served as a colonel on the staff in the Ionian islands, then was promoted Major-General on 7 May 1845. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles of Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Tipperary, and Baron Culloden on 8 July 1850.
The Duke of Cambridge became Inspector of the Cavalry in 1852. In February 1854, at an early stage in the Crimean War of 1853–1856, he received command of the 1st Division (Guards and Highland brigades) of the British army in the East. On 19 June 1854, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. 
He was present at the battles of the Alma (September 1854), Balaclava (October 1854) and Inkerman (November 1854), and at the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855).

In December 1854, owing to illness, the Earl of Cardigan returned first to Malta and then to England: before the conclusion of the Crimean campaign he was back in London. Meanwhile, Lord Raglan died at 9.30 pm on 28 June 1855 from dysentery; General Simpson succeeded Raglan in commanding in the Crimea, followed by General Codrington. Field Marshal Viscount Hardinge, the serving &quot;general commanding-in-chief&quot; since 1852, was forced to resign in July 1856 on grounds of ill-health. (The Crimean War had ended in March 1856.)

On 5 July 1856, the Duke was appointed &quot;general commanding-in-chief&quot; of the British Army, a post that was re-titled &quot;field marshal commanding-in-chief&quot; on 9 November 1862 and commander-in-chief of the forces by Letters Patent on 20 November 1887. In that capacity he served as the chief military advisor to the Secretary of State for War, with responsibility for the administration of the army and the command of forces in the field. He was promoted to the rank of general on 15 July 1856 and to the rank of field marshal on 9 November 1862.

===Policies===

The Duke of Cambridge served as commander-in-chief for 39 years. Early in his term he encouraged the army to trial various breech-loading carbines for the cavalry, one of which—the Westley Richards—proved so effective that it was decided to investigate the possibility of producing a version for the infantry. In 1861, 100 were issued to five infantry battalions; in 1863 an order of 2,000 was placed for further trials. The Duke was also involved in the formation of the Staff College and of the Royal Military School of Music, and became governor of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich: he further sought to improve the efficiency of the army by advocating a scheme of annual military manoeuvres. In 1860 he introduced a new system to restrict corporal punishment: soldiers became eligible for flogging only in cases of aggravated mutinous conduct during wartime, unless they committed an offence serious enough to degrade to the second class and make them once again subject to corporal punishment. A year&#x27;s good behaviour would return them to the first class, meaning that only a hard core of incorrigible offenders tended to be flogged.

===Opposition to reforms===

Under the Duke&#x27;s command, the British Army became a moribund and stagnant institution. There were no new ideas. He allegedly rebuked one of his more intelligent subordinates with the words: &quot;Brains? I don&#x27;t believe in brains! You haven&#x27;t any, I know, Sir!&quot; He was equally forthright on his reluctance to adopt change: &quot;There is a time for everything, and the time for change is when you can no longer help it.&quot;

In the wake of the Prussian victories in the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War, the Liberal Party government of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and Secretary of State for War Edward Cardwell called for the Army to undergo major reforms. Cardwell succeeded in pushing through a number of reforms, including one that made the commander-in-chief nominally report to the secretary of state for war.

The Duke opposed most of the reforms because they struck at the heart of his view of the Army. According to Theo Aronson, he &quot;stoutly resisted almost every attempt at reform or modernization.&quot; He feared that the newly created force of reservists would be of little use in a colonial conflict, and that expeditionary forces would have to strip the most experienced men from the home-based battalions in order to fill the gaps in their ranks. His fears seemed to be confirmed in 1873, when Wolseley raided battalions for the expedition against the Ashanti. In 1881, when the historic numbers of regiments were abolished and facing colours standardised for English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish regiments, the Duke protested that regimental spirit would be degraded; the majority of facing colours were restored by the time of World War I, although the numbers of regiments were not.

The reforming impetus, however, continued. Parliament passed the War Office Act 1870, which formally subordinated the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces to the Secretary of State for War and in 1871 Cardwell abolished the custom of purchasing an office which had done much to instil elitism in the form of discipline and training. The Duke of Cambridge strongly resented this move, a sentiment shared by a majority of officers, who would no longer be able to sell their commissions when they retired.

Pressures for reform built up as the Duke of Cambridge aged; his strongest ally was his cousin, Queen Victoria. While the Queen insisted on reform, she was also protective of the Household brigades and their long association and traditions. An 1890 royal commission led by Lord Hartington (later the 8th Duke of Devonshire) criticised the administration of the War Office and recommended the devolution of authority from the Commander-in-Chief to subordinate military officers. A number of reformers opposed to the Duke banded together, including Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Lord Lansdowne, the Liberal and Conservative Secretaries for War between 1892 and 1900. The leading generals eager to replace the Duke were Wolseley, Buller (1802–1884), Roberts (1832–1914), and the Duke of Connaught (1850–1942). The Duke of Cambridge was forced to resign his post on 1 November 1895, and was succeeded by Lord Wolseley. On his resignation he was given the title of honorary colonel-in-chief to the Forces.

Historian Correlli Barnett blames British failures in the Second Boer War of 1899–1902 on the Duke, stressing the Army&#x27;s &quot;[l]ack of organization, ignorant and casual officers, inferior human material in the ranks&quot; as well as &quot;soldiers drilled to machine-like movements [versus the Boer] with a rifle working on his own initiative.&quot;

== Friend of Haig ==

During the Duke&#x27;s long career he helped to further the career progress of Douglas Haig, a talented and able young officer, who succeeded through Staff College to gain promotion. As Commander-in-Chief, the Duke was able to admit any candidate to the college so long as they passed three out of eight of the tests. Haig, who was also acquainted with Sir Evelyn Wood, left for India in 1893 knowing that the Duke had also made a friend of Henrietta Jameson (née Haig), his older sister. The Duke&#x27;s nomination was made in 1894 and 1895, but Haig did not take up the place until 15 January 1896 under Army Regulations Order 72 (1896). The Duke, who was replaced by Lord Wolseley, after 32 years was not the only patron of preferment. The Staff College was not intended to educate a &quot;General Staff&quot; until much later in its historical development. However the traditional system of informal patronage was gradually giving way to more than gifted amateurs.

On 22 November 1909 the reforms to which Haig, as Director of Staff Duties was a part, abolished the post of Commander-in-Chief which the Duke had made his own. In setting up the Army Council, with its head being called the Chief of the General Staff by Order in Council, the Liberal government separated the army from the monarchy.

==Marriage and mistress==
It is believed, according to Roger Fulford, that William IV, who had been his godfather when Duke of Clarence, had George brought up at Windsor in hope of an eventual marriage to his cousin Princess Victoria of Kent, who was two months younger. This prospective match was favoured by George&#x27;s own parents, but was forestalled by Victoria&#x27;s maternal uncle Leopold I of Belgium. He secured Victoria&#x27;s betrothal to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which became formal after she acceded to the British throne. In 1839 Queen Victoria wrote to Albert about George&#x27;s father: &quot;The Duke told Lord Melbourne he had always greatly desired our marriage, and never thought of George: but that &quot;I&quot; don&#x27;t believe.&quot; George was one of a range of suitors considered by Victoria, the most prominent of whom, Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, was openly favoured by William.

The Duke of Cambridge made no secret of his view that &quot;arranged marriages were doomed to failure.&quot; He married privately, without seeking Queen Victoria&#x27;s consent, at St John Clerkenwell, London, on 8 January 1847 to Sarah Fairbrother (1816 – 12 January 1890), the daughter of John Fairbrother, a servant in Westminster. Sarah Fairbrother (whose stage name was Louisa) had been an actress since 1827, performing at Drury Lane, the Lyceum, and Covent Garden Theatre. Without the Queen&#x27;s consent, the wedding ceremony was in contravention of the 1772 Royal Marriages Act, rendering the marriage void. This meant the Duke&#x27;s wife was not titled Duchess of Cambridge or accorded the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;, while the son born after the marriage was illegitimate and ineligible to succeed to the Duke&#x27;s titles. Indeed, Sarah&#x27;s very existence was ignored by the Queen. Instead, Sarah called herself &quot;Mrs. Fairbrother&quot; and later &quot;Mrs. FitzGeorge&quot;. The Duke was a very weak man where women were concerned, and it seems likely that he had been cajoled into marriage by Sarah (then pregnant for the fifth time), she herself obtaining the licence. Legend has created for the couple an ideal relationship that is far from the reality; the Duke having other affairs.
From 1837 the Duke had known Louisa Beauclerk, third daughter of Sir George Wombwell, 2nd Baronet, whom he later described as &quot;the idol of my life and my existence.&quot; He saw much of her in 1847, and she was his mistress from at least 1849 until her death in 1882. As early as 1849 he had decided that he would be buried near Beauclerk and it was solely on her account that Sarah Fairbrother and he were deposited in the mausoleum in Kensal Green Cemetery, west of the main chapel, about sixty feet away from Beauclerk&#x27;s grave.

==Later life==

The Duke of Cambridge served as colonel-in-chief of the 17th Lancers, Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers; The Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own) and King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps; colonel of the Grenadier Guards; honorary colonel of the 10th (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own) Bengal Lancers, 20th Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own Punjabis, 4 Battalion Suffolk Regiment, 1st City of London Volunteer Brigade and the Scots Fusilier Guards. He became the Ranger of Hyde Park and St. James&#x27;s Park in 1852, and of Richmond Park in 1857; governor of the Royal Military Academy in 1862, and its president in 1870. He was the patron of the Oxford Military College from 1876 to 1896.

Cambridge&#x27;s strength and hearing began to fade in his later years. He was unable to ride at Queen Victoria&#x27;s funeral and had to attend in a carriage. He paid his last visit to Germany in August 1903. He died of a haemorrhage of the stomach in 1904 at Gloucester House, Piccadilly, London. His remains were buried five days later next to those of his wife in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

In 1904, his estate was probated at under £121,000.

The Duke is today commemorated by an equestrian statue standing on Whitehall in central London; it is positioned outside the front door of the War Office that he so strongly resisted. He is also commemorated by two street names in Kingston Vale and Norbiton, in southwest London, George Road and Cambridge Road; the Duke inherited much of the land in the area from his father in 1850. Cambridge Military Hospital in Aldershot was built during his time as Commander-in-Chief.

==Titles, styles and honours==

As the male-line grandson of a King of Hanover, Prince George of Cambridge also bore the titles of &#x27;Prince of Hanover&#x27; and &#x27;Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg&#x27;.

His title, &#x27;Duke of Cambridge&#x27;, fell into extinction upon his death. It was not revived until 107 years later, when Elizabeth II (Prince George&#x27;s great-great-niece through his sister Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge) awarded the title to her grandson, Prince William, on 29 April 2011, the day of his wedding.

<doc id="287938" wikidata="Q3293969" url="?curid=287938" title="Marjory Stoneman Douglas">
<text>Marjory Stoneman Douglas (April 7, 1890 – May 14, 1998) was an American journalist, author, women&#x27;s suffrage advocate, and conservationist known for her staunch defense of the Everglades against efforts to drain it and reclaim land for development. Moving to Miami as a young woman to work for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, she became a freelance writer, producing over one hundred short stories that were published in popular magazines. Her most influential work was the book &quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot; (1947), which redefined the popular conception of the Everglades as a treasured river instead of a worthless swamp. Its impact has been compared to that of Rachel Carson&#x27;s influential book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; (1962). Her books, stories, and journalism career brought her influence in Miami, enabling her to advance her causes.

As a young woman, Douglas was outspoken and politically conscious of the women&#x27;s suffrage and civil rights movements. She was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 79 years old. For the remaining 29 years of her life she was &quot;a relentless reporter and fearless crusader&quot; for the natural preservation and restoration of South Florida. Her tireless efforts earned her several variations of the nickname &quot;Grande Dame of the Everglades&quot; as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from land development in Florida. She received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was inducted into several halls of fame.

Douglas lived to 108, working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration. Upon her death, an obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; in London stated, &quot;In the history of the American environmental movement, there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas.&quot;

==Early life==
Marjory Stoneman was born on April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the only child of concert violinist Florence Lillian Trefethen (1859-1912) and Frank Bryant Stoneman (1857–1941). One of her earliest memories was her father reading to her &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, at which she burst into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe. She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, which she kept well into adulthood until &quot;some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back&quot;. She visited Florida when she was four, and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the Tampa Bay Hotel. From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from Tampa to Havana.

Marjory&#x27;s parents separated when she was six. Her father endured a series of failed entrepreneurial ventures and the instability caused her mother to move them abruptly to the Trefethen family house in Taunton, Massachusetts. She lived there with her mother, aunt, and grandparents, who did not get along well and consistently spoke ill of her father, to her dismay. Her mother, whom Marjory characterized as &quot;high-strung&quot;, was committed to a mental sanitarium in Providence several times. Her parents&#x27; separation and the contentiousness of her mother&#x27;s family caused her to suffer from night terrors. She credited her tenuous upbringing with making her &quot;a skeptic and a dissenter&quot; for the rest of her life.

As a youth, Marjory found solace in reading, and eventually, she began to write. At sixteen she contributed to the most popular children&#x27;s publication of the day, &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;—also the first publisher of 20th-century writers F. Scott Fitzgerald, Rachel Carson, and William Faulkner—with a puzzle titled &quot;Double Beheadings and Double Curtailings&quot;. In 1907, she was awarded a prize by the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; for &quot;An Early Morning Paddle&quot;, a story about a boy who watches a sunrise from a canoe. As her mother&#x27;s mental health deteriorated, Marjory took on more responsibilities, eventually managing some of the family finances and gaining a maturity imposed upon her by circumstance.

===Education and marriage===
Marjory left for college in 1908, despite grave misgivings about her mother&#x27;s mental state. Her aunt and grandmother shared her concerns, but recognized that she needed to leave in order to begin her own life. She was a straight-A student at Wellesley College, graduating with a BA in English in 1912. She found particular success in a class on elocution, and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates. She was elected Class Orator but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities. During her senior year while visiting home, her mother showed her a lump on her breast. Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed. After the graduation ceremony, her aunt informed her it had metastasized, and within months her mother was dead. The family left the funeral arrangements up to Marjory.

After drifting with college friends through a few jobs to which she did not feel well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She was so impressed with his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30 years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other matters. Douglas was married to Marjory while already married to another woman. While he spent six months in jail for passing a bad check, she remained faithful to him. His scheme to scam her absent father out of money worked in Marjory&#x27;s favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman&#x27;s attention. Marjory&#x27;s uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and end the marriage. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents&#x27; separation. Shortly before that, her father had married Lillius (&quot;Lilla&quot;) Eleanor Shine, a great-great-granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson (her grandfather was Francis W. Eppes). Marjory later wrote that Shine &quot;remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida.&quot; After moving to Florida in 1915, Marjory rarely returned to Massachusetts, but she retained affection for it; her 1987 memoir &quot;Voice of the River,&quot; is dedicated &quot;To Massachusetts, with love.&quot;

==Writing career==

===&quot;The Miami Herald&quot;===
Douglas arrived in South Florida when fewer than 5,000 people lived in Miami and it was &quot;no more than a glorified railroad terminal&quot;. Her father, Frank Stoneman, was the first publisher of the paper that later became &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;. Stoneman passionately opposed the governor of Florida, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, and his attempts to drain the Everglades. He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for circuit judge, Broward refused to validate the election, so Stoneman was referred to as &quot;Judge&quot; for the rest of his life without performing the duties of one.

Douglas joined the newspaper&#x27;s staff in 1915. She began as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: &quot;Somebody would say, &#x27;Who&#x27;s that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you&#x27;ve got in your column?&#x27; And I would say, &#x27;Oh, you know, I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s been here very long&#x27;&quot;. When her father went on vacation less than a year after her arrival in Miami, he left her the responsibility of the editorial page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at &quot;The Miami Metropolis&quot; whose greater familiarity with Miami history gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to check her facts better.

Douglas was given an assignment in 1916 to write a story on the first woman from Miami to join the US Naval Reserve. When the woman did not show up for the interview, Douglas herself joined the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, which stationed her in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed and cared for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, &quot;helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later&quot;.

After the war, Douglas served as assistant editor at &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;. She gained some renown for her daily column, &quot;The Galley&quot;, becoming something of a local celebrity. She amassed a devoted readership and attempted to begin each column with a poem. &quot;The Galley&quot; was topical and went in any direction Douglas chose. She promoted responsible urban planning when Miami saw a population boom of 100,000 people in a decade. She wrote supporting women&#x27;s suffrage, civil rights, and better sanitation while opposing Prohibition and foreign trade tariffs.

Some of the stories she wrote spoke of the region&#x27;s wealth as being in its &quot;inevitable development&quot;, and she supplemented her income with $100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida, something she would reconsider later in her life. In the early 1920s she wrote &quot;Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now&quot;, a ballad lamenting the death of a 22-year-old vagrant who was beaten to death in a labor camp. It was printed in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, and read aloud during a session of the Florida Legislature, which passed a law banning convict leasing in large part due to her writing. &quot;I think that&#x27;s the single most important thing I was ever able to accomplish as a result of something I&#x27;ve written&quot;, she wrote in her autobiography.

===Freelance writer===
After quitting the newspaper in 1923, Douglas worked as a freelance writer. From 1920 to 1990, Douglas published 109 fiction articles and stories. One of her first stories was sold to the pulp fiction magazine &quot;Black Mask&quot; for $600 (equivalent to $ in 2024). Forty of her stories were published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;; one, &quot;Story of a Homely Woman&quot;, was reprinted in 1937 in the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; best short stories compilation. Recurring settings in her fiction were South Florida, the Caribbean, and Europe during World War I. Her protagonists were often independent, quirky women or youthful underdogs who encountered social or natural injustices. The people and animals of the Everglades served as subjects for some of her earliest writings. &quot;Plumes&quot;, originally published in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1930, was based on the murder of Guy Bradley, an Audubon Society game warden, by poachers. &quot;Wings&quot; was a nonfiction story, also first appearing in the &quot;Post&quot; in 1931, that addressed the slaughter of Everglades wading birds for their feathers. Her story &quot;Peculiar Treasure of a King&quot; was a second-place finalist in the O. Henry Award competition in 1928.

During the 1930s, she was commissioned to write a pamphlet supporting a botanical garden called &quot;An argument for the establishment of a tropical botanical garden in South Florida.&quot; Its success caused her to be in demand at garden clubs where she delivered speeches throughout the area, then to serve on the board to support the Fairchild Garden. She called the garden &quot;one of the greatest achievements for the entire area&quot;.

Douglas became involved with the Miami Theater, and wrote some one-act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s. One, &quot;The Gallows Gate&quot;, was about an argument between a mother and father regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang. She got the idea from her father, who had witnessed hangings when he lived in the West and was unnerved by the creaking sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body. The play won a state competition, and eventually $500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts. With William W. Muir, husband of reporter Helen Muir, she authored &quot;Storm Warnings&quot;, a play loosely based on the life of mobster Al Capone. Some of Capone&#x27;s henchmen showed up at the theater, &quot;add[ing] an extra tingle for the audience that night&quot;, though no actual problems arose. Douglas wrote the foreword to the Work Projects Administration&#x27;s guide to Miami and environs, published in 1941 as part of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project&#x27;s American Guide Series.

Douglas served as the book review editor of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; from 1942 to 1949, and as editor for the University of Miami Press from 1960 to 1963. She released her first novel, &quot;Road to the Sun&quot;, in 1952. She wrote four novels, and several nonfiction books on regional topics including Florida birdwatching and David Fairchild, a biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami. Her autobiography, &quot;Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River&quot;, was written with John Rothchild in 1987. She had been working on a book about W. H. Hudson for years, traveling to Argentina and England several times. It was incomplete when she died in 1998.

===&quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot;===
Early in the 1940s, Douglas was approached by a publisher to contribute to the Rivers of America Series by writing about the Miami River. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about &quot;an inch long”, but in researching it she became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher to allow her to write about the Everglades instead. She spent five years researching what little was known about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida. Douglas spent time with geologist Garald Parker, who discovered that South Florida&#x27;s sole freshwater source was the Biscayne Aquifer, and it was filled by the Everglades. Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas, trying to capture the Everglades&#x27; essence, asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass.

&quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot; was published in 1947 and sold out of its first printing in a month. The book&#x27;s first line, &quot;There are no other Everglades in the world&quot;, has been called the &quot;most famous passage ever written about the Everglades&quot;, and the line once welcomed visitors to the Everglades National Park website. Douglas characterized the Everglades as an ecosystem surrounding a river worthy of protection, inescapably connected to South Florida&#x27;s people and cultures. She outlined its imminent disappearance in the last chapter, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;:

Cattlemen&#x27;s grass fires roared uncontrolled. Cane-field fires spread crackling and hissing in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and billowing mountains of heavy, cream-colored, purple-shadowed smoke. Training planes flying over the Glades dropped bombs or cigarette butts, and the fires exploded in the hearts of the drying hammocks and raced on before every wind leaving only blackness ... There was no water in the canals with which to fight [the fires] ... The sweet water the rock had held was gone or had shrunk far down into its strange holes and cleavages.

&quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot; galvanized people to protect the Everglades and has been compared to Rachel Carson&#x27;s 1962 exposé of the harmful effects of DDT, &quot;Silent Spring&quot;; both books are &quot;groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice&quot;. Its impact is still felt as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists, and &quot;remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades&quot;. It has gone through numerous editions, selling 500,000 copies since its original publication. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote of it in 1997, &quot;Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world&quot;. The downside of the book&#x27;s impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her metaphor of a River of Grass is so predominant that the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades is oversimplified. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas&#x27;s &quot;appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system&quot; she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.

==Activism==
Women&#x27;s suffrage was an early interest of Douglas, and although she tended to shy away from polemics in her early work at &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, on her third day as a society columnist, she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions. In 1917, she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s wife, and two other women to Tallahassee to speak in support of women&#x27;s right to vote. Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: &quot;All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was like talking to graven images. They never paid attention to us at all.&quot; Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920.

Using her influence at &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, Douglas wrote columns about poverty:

You can have the most beautiful city in the world as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept ... but if you have a weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value.

In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.

===Everglades work===
Stoneman Douglas became involved in the Everglades in the 1920s, when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee, a group led by Ernest F. Coe and dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades. By the 1960s, the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross mismanagement in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development. Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups, in 1969—at the age of 79—Douglas founded Friends of the Everglades to protest the construction of a jetport in the Big Cypress portion of the Everglades. She justified her involvement saying, &quot;It is a woman&#x27;s business to be interested in the environment. It&#x27;s an extended form of housekeeping.&quot;

She toured the state giving &quot;hundreds of ringing denunciations&quot; of the airport project, and increased membership of Friends of the Everglades to 3,000 within three years. She ran the public information operation full-time from her home and encountered hostility from the jetport&#x27;s developers and backers, who called her a &quot;damn butterfly chaser&quot;. President Richard Nixon, however, scrapped funding for the project due to the efforts of many Everglades watchdog groups.

Douglas continued her activism and focused her efforts on restoring the Everglades after declaring that &quot;Conservation is now a dead word ... You can&#x27;t conserve what you haven&#x27;t got.&quot; Her criticism was directed at two entities she considered were doing the most damage to the Everglades. A coalition of sugarcane growers, named Big Sugar, she accused of polluting Lake Okeechobee by pumping water tainted with chemicals, human waste, and garbage back into the lake, which served as the fresh water source for the Miami metropolitan area. She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the West Indies, which, she claimed, was more environmentally sound, had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients, and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content.

Besides Big Sugar, Douglas spoke about the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by diverting the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central &amp; South Florida Project (C&amp;SF), run by former members of the Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers&#x27; irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. &quot;What a liar I turned out to be!&quot; remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, &quot;Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they take it out on us by playing with cement&quot;.

Douglas was giving a speech addressing the harmful practices of the Army Corps of Engineers when the colonel in attendance dropped his pen on the floor. As he was stooping to pick it up, Douglas stopped her speech and said to him, &quot;Colonel! You can crawl under that table and hide, but you can&#x27;t get away from me!&quot;

In 1973, Douglas attended a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild:

Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O&#x27;Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don&#x27;t remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm&#x27;s. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn&#x27;t also intimidate the mosquitoes ... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who&#x27;d heard her speak.

Douglas was not well received by some audiences. She opposed the drainage of a suburb in Dade County named East Everglades. After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, she was the only opposing voice. At the hearing in 1983, she was booed, jeered, and shouted at by the audience of residents. &quot;Can&#x27;t you boo any louder than that?&quot; she chided, eventually making them laugh. &quot;Look. I&#x27;m an old lady. I&#x27;ve been here since eight o&#x27;clock. It&#x27;s now eleven. I&#x27;ve got all night, and I&#x27;m used to the heat,&quot; she told them. Later, she wrote, &quot;They&#x27;re all good souls—they just shouldn&#x27;t be out there.&quot; Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain.

Florida Governor Lawton Chiles explained her impact, saying, &quot;Marjory was the first voice to really wake a lot of us up to what we were doing to our quality of life. She was not just a pioneer of the environmental movement, she was a prophet, calling out to us to save the environment for our children and our grandchildren.&quot;

===Other causes===
Douglas also served as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter organized in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8 million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.

==Personal life==

===Religious views===
Although Douglas grew up in an Episcopal household, she described herself as agnostic throughout her life, and forbade any religious ceremony at her memorial. Douglas tied her agnosticism to her unanswered prayers when her mother was dying. However, she credited the motivation for her support of women&#x27;s suffrage to her Quaker paternal grandparents whose dedication to the abolition of slavery she admired, and proudly claimed Levi Coffin, an organizer of the Underground Railroad, was her great-great-uncle. She wrote that his wife was a friend of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and had provided Stowe with the story of Eliza in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; fleeing slavery because Douglas&#x27;s great-great-aunt took care of Eliza and her infant after their escape. Frank Stoneman grew up in a Quaker colony, and Douglas maintained he kept touches of his upbringing throughout his life, even after converting to Episcopalianism. Writer Jack Davis and neighbor Helen Muir suggest this Quaker influence was behind Douglas&#x27;s use of &quot;Friends&quot; in naming the organizations Friends of the Everglades and Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries.

===Mental health===
As a child, Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents&#x27; separation. She witnessed her mother&#x27;s emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited bizarre, childlike behaviors. Following her mother&#x27;s death, her relocation to Miami, and her displeasure in working as the assistant editor at &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, in the 1920s, she suffered the first of three nervous breakdowns.

Douglas suggested she had what she referred to as &quot;blank periods&quot; before and during her marriage, but they were brief. She connected these lapses to her mother&#x27;s insanity. She eventually quit the newspaper, but after her father&#x27;s death in 1941 she suffered a third and final breakdown, when her neighbors found her roaming the neighborhood one night screaming. She realized she had a &quot;father complex&quot;, explaining it by saying, &quot;Having been brought up without him all those years, and then coming back and finding him so sympathetic had a powerful effect&quot;.

===Personal habits===

Regardless of her dedication to the preservation of the Everglades, Douglas admitted the time she spent actually there was sporadic, driving there for occasional picnics. &quot;To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there ... It&#x27;s too buggy, too wet, too generally inhospitable&quot;, she wrote. Instead, she understood that the health of the environment indicated the general well-being of humanity.

Despite Douglas&#x27;s demure appearance—she stood at and weighed , and was always immaculately dressed in pearls, a floppy straw hat and gloves—she had an uncanny ability to get her point across. She was known for speaking in perfect, precise paragraphs, and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades. Jeff Klinkenberg, a reporter for the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; who interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas, wrote of her, &quot;She had a tongue like a switchblade and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen.&quot; Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.

She enjoyed drinking Scotch and sherry; as friend and neighbor Helen Muir remembered her, &quot;She would come up and have a sherry, and then I would walk her home, and then she&#x27;d walk me back, and we would have another sherry. What fun she was.&quot; Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir &quot;the Stewart Avenue Gang&quot;. The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and the role of women in South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.

She was attached to several men after her divorce, counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross, as he had already gone to France as a soldier. However, she said she did not believe in extramarital sex and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous. She told Klinkenberg in 1992, frankly, that she had not had sex since her divorce, saying &quot;I wasn&#x27;t a wild woman&quot;. However, she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work. &quot;People don&#x27;t seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex, all the emotion that surrounds it, can be well employed in other ways&quot;, she wrote in her autobiography.

==Awards, death, and legacy==
===Honors===
Douglas began accruing honors in her early days writing for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;. In the 1980s, the awards became more prestigious, and her reactions to them mixed. The Florida Department of Natural Resources (now the Florida Department of Environmental Protection) named its headquarters in Tallahassee after her in 1980, which she considered a dubious honor. She told a friend she would have rather seen the Everglades restored than her name on a building. During her polite acceptance speech, she railed against Ronald Reagan and the then-Secretary of the Interior James Watt for their lackluster approach to environmental conservation. In 1986 the National Parks Conservation Association established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award, which &quot;honor(s) individuals who often must go to great lengths to advocate and fight for the protection of the National Park System&quot;. Despite blindness and diminished hearing, Douglas continued to be active into her second century, and was honored with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II, to whom Douglas gave a signed copy of &quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot; in 1991. Instead of gifts and celebrations, Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday, resulting in over 100,000 planted trees across the state and a bald cypress on the lawn of the governor&#x27;s mansion. The South Florida Water Management District began removing exotic plants that had taken hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102.

In 1993, when she was 103, President Bill Clinton awarded Douglas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor granted by the United States of America. The citation for the medal read,

Marjory Stoneman Douglas personifies passionate commitment. Her crusade to preserve and restore the Everglades has enhanced our Nation&#x27;s respect for our precious environment, reminding all of us of nature&#x27;s delicate balance. Grateful Americans honor the &#x27;Grandmother of the Glades&#x27; by following her splendid example in safeguarding America&#x27;s beauty and splendor for generations to come.

Douglas donated her medal to Wellesley College. Most of the others she received she stored at her home.

Douglas was posthumously inducted into the National Wildlife Federation Hall of Fame in 1999, and the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2000. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, &quot;Why should they have a Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to put me in the other day? Why not a Citizens&#x27; Hall of Fame?&quot; 

Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier-mâché bust of her with Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She appears as a major supporting character in the 2014 point-and-click adventure &quot;A Golden Wake&quot;.

Some of Douglas&#x27;s stories were collected by University of Florida professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections: &quot;Nine Florida Stories&quot; in 1990 and &quot;A River In Flood&quot; in 1998. McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas&#x27;s short stories because most people in the 1990s were well aware of her as an environmentalist but did not know about her career as a freelance writer. &quot;Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well-being of Florida than this little lady from Coconut Grove&quot;, McCarthy wrote in the introduction to &quot;A River in Flood&quot;.

===Remembrances===
Marjory Stoneman Douglas died at the age of 108 on May 14, 1998. John Rothchild, who helped write her autobiography, said that her death was the only thing that could &quot;shut her up&quot; and added, &quot;The silence is terrible.&quot; Carl Hiaasen eulogized her in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, writing that &quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot; was &quot;monumental&quot;, and praised her passion and her resolve; even when politicians finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for a photo opportunity, she still provoked them to do more and do it faster.

The National Wildlife Federation described her as &quot;a passionate, articulate, and tireless voice for the environment&quot;. Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, &quot;She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn&#x27;t give a lot of credibility to excuses about why they&#x27;re not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can&#x27;t holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, &#x27;Yes, Ma&#x27;am.&#x27;&quot; She was aware of it, once saying, &quot;People can&#x27;t be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me.&quot; Her ashes were scattered in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park, which was named for her in 1997.

In 2000, the Naples, Florida-based composer Steve Heitzeg wrote a 15-minute orchestra piece entitled &quot;Voice of the Everglades (Epitaph for Marjory Stoneman Douglas)&quot; for the Naples Philharmonic. Heitzeg said, &quot;She was outspoken, she was direct, she had the energy and belief to make the world a better place.&quot; 

Two South Florida public schools are named in her honor: Broward County Public Schools&#x27; Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (opened in 1990, the year of her 100th birthday) and Miami-Dade County Public Schools&#x27; Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary School.

===Douglas home===
Douglas&#x27;s cottage in Coconut Grove at 3744–3754 Stewart Avenue, was built in 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories there, and the City of Miami designated it an historic site in 1995, not only for its famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture. After Douglas&#x27;s death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life-size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas&#x27;s house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. Water service was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes. All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources. A park ranger was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property.

On April 22, 2015, while giving an Earth Day speech in the Everglades, President Barack Obama announced that Interior Secretary Sally Jewell had designated the house a National Historic Landmark.

<text>Leendert &quot;Leonard&quot; Gansevoort (July 14, 1751 – August 26, 1810) was an American political leader from New York who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1788.

==Early life==
He was born in 1751 in Albany County, New York to Harmen Gansevoort (1712–1801) and Magdalena Douw Gansevoort (1718–1796), both from prominent Dutch families. He was the younger brother of Brig. Gen. Peter Gansevoort (1749–1812).

Gansevoort&#x27;s ancestors had been in Albany since 1660, when it was the Dutch colony of Fort Orange, and Harmen Harmense Gansevoort (ca. 1634–1709) owned a brewery and farms. His brother&#x27;s son, Peter Gansevoort, Herman Gansevoort (1779–1862) built the Gansevoort Mansion in 1813 on his father&#x27;s tract at Gansevoort in Saratoga County, New York. His father was the third of his family&#x27;s generation in America, who were prominent brewers and merchants in Albany.

His mother was descended from the Van Rensselaer family as her mother, Anna Van Rensselaer, was a daughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667–1740), who had married Peter Douw. In addition, his first cousin, Leonard Gansevoort (1754–1834), an Albany lawyer and alderman, was married to Maria Van Rensselaer (1760–1841), the daughter of Col. Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1717–1781), the granddaughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer and the sister of Henry K. Van Rensselaer (1744–1816), Philip Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1747–1798), and Killian K. Van Rensselaer (1763–1845).

==Career==
After the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he became a member of the Albany Committee of Correspondence serving as treasurer until November 1775. When the 2nd New York Provincial Congress convened in New York City on December 6, 1775, he was one of the twelve deputies elected by the Albany Committee.

He wrote to his brother, Peter on October 31, 1775, stating:

&quot;Dr Brother&lt;br&gt;I can hardly express my Distress upon receiving a Letter from Mr James Van Rensselaer acquainting me with your indisposition and that you in consequence thereof had been obliged to leave Chanblee and that you was then in Coll: Biddels Camp on the North side of St John&#x27;s; every thing seem&#x27;d to consire to confirm me in the Opinion that you must have been very ill you cannot be ignorant of the Emotions in my Breast when you consider that Fraternal Affection which has always subsisted between us, and in what Manner I must have also felt when prompted by Duty I communicated the Contents of the Letter to our Joint Parents, I was oblig&#x27;d to meliorate the News by telling them that your indisposition was the Fever Ague but do assure you that upon reading the Letter from the same Gent. to Mr Philip Van Rensselaer that tho&#x27; you was then yet pretty Weak you was greatly recovered, I seem&#x27;d to be rais&#x27;d from the lowest Abyss of dispondence to the highest pinnacle of Hope and I will leave you to reflect how industrious I was to communicate it to the old people - I beg Dear Brother as you Love your Friends who are under the greatest uneasiness yet that you will write us a Line if you are able, and if not procure some one to write for you - and beg further that if you are not recovered on receipt of this that you will apply for leave to come down and write me before you set out that I may meet you on your Way - I should have been up with you already If I could possibly have obtained leave of Hetty&lt;br&gt;We are well I am Your loving Brother&lt;br&gt;Leonard Gansevoort&lt;br&gt;Albany Octr 31 1774&lt;br&gt;To Peter Gansevoort Junr Esqr [Provincial Camp at St Johns]&quot;

He was also appointed to the 3rd and 4th Provincial Congresses in 1776 and 1777, where the Constitution of the State of New York was adopted on April 20, 1777. From April 18, 1777 to May 14, 1777, he was the president of the New York Provincial Congress committee of safety.

Following the end of Revolution in 1789, he bought a country house and estate known as Whitehall, which was located a mile and a half from Albany, from John Bradstreet Schuyler, the son of Philip Schuyler. Gansevoort was known for his entertainment of many prominent state and national political figures. In 1778 and 1779, he served as a member of the New York State Assembly.

Early in his political career he was aligned with the patrician group of the large estates owners and commercial interests, but later became involved with the early evolution of the Democratic Party in New York. He served in the State Assembly again from 1787 to 1788 and in the State Senate from 1791 to 1793 and 1796–1802, where he was chairman of the committee, as a Federalist.

In 1794, he was appointed a colonel in the New York militia. From 1794 to 1797 he was a judge in Albany. From 1799 to 1810, he was a judge of the court of probates.

==Personal life==
On April 10, 1770, he married Hester Cuyler (1748–1826), the daughter of Abraham Cuyler, Jr. (1713–1749), a cousin of Abraham Cuyler, and Jannetje Beekman (1719–1798), a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman (1623–1707). Together, they had:

* Magdalena Gansevoort (b. 1771)
* Catharina Gansevoort (b. 1772)
* Abraham Cuyler Gansevoort (b. 1775)
* Magdalena Gansevoort (1777–1863), who married Jacob Ten Eyck (1771–1862), on March 6, 1795, the son of Abraham Ten Eyck and grandson of Mayor Jacob Coenraedt Ten Eyck.
* Catharine Cuyler Gansevoort (1789–1853), who married Teunis Van Vechten (1785–1859), nephew of Abraham Van Vechten

He died in 1810 at home in Albany and was buried in Albany Rural Cemetery.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter, Magdalena, he was the grandfather of Hester Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1796–1861), Abraham Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1798–1830), Leonard Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1801–1881), Jacob L. Ten Eyck (1804–1875), and Herman Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1806–1881), and Peter Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1810–1891).

Through his daughter, Catharine, he was the grandfather of Elizabeth Ann Van Vechten (1812–1812), Leonard Gansevoort Van Vechten (1813–1837), Hester Elizabeth Van Vechten Trotter (1815–1881), Teunis Van Vechten (1819–1859), Cuyler Van Vechten (1823–1825), and Cuyler Van Vechten (1830–1875).

He was also the great-uncle of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; author Herman Melville.

<doc id="287952" wikidata="Q911932" url="?curid=287952" title="Honeypot (computing)">
<text>In computer terminology, a honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site which contains information or resources of value to attackers. It is actually isolated, monitored, and capable of blocking or analyzing the attackers. This is similar to police sting operations, colloquially known as &quot;baiting&quot; a suspect.

The main use for this network decoy is to distract potential attackers from more important information and machines on the real network, learn about the forms of attacks they can suffer, and examine such attacks during and after the exploitation of a honeypot.
It provides a way to prevent and see vulnerabilities in a specific network system. A honeypot is a decoy used to protect a network from present or future attacks. Honeypots derive their value from the use by attackers. If not interacted with, the honeypot has little to no value. Honeypots can be used for everything from slowing down or stopping automated attacks, capturing new exploits, to gathering intelligence on emerging threats or early warning and prediction.

==Types==

Honeypots can be differentiated based on whether they are physical or virtual:
* Physical honeypot: a real machine with its own IP address, this machine simulates behaviors modeled by the system. Many times this modality is not used as much as the high price of acquiring new machines, their maintenance, and the complication affected by configuring specialized hardware
* Virtual honeypot: the use of this type of honeypot allows one to install and simulate hosts on the network from different operating systems, but in order to do so, it is necessary to simulate the TCP/IP of the target operating system. This modality is more frequent.
Honeypots can be classified based on their deployment (use/action) and based on their level of involvement. Based on deployment, honeypots may be classified as:
* production honeypots
* research honeypots
Production honeypots are easy to use, capture only limited information, and are used primarily by corporations. Production honeypots are placed inside the production network with other production servers by an organization to improve their overall state of security. Normally, production honeypots are low-interaction honeypots, which are easier to deploy. They give less information about the attacks or attackers than research honeypots.

Research honeypots are run to gather information about the motives and tactics of the black hat community targeting different networks. These honeypots do not add direct value to a specific organization; instead, they are used to research the threats that organizations face and to learn how to better protect against those threats. Research honeypots are complex to deploy and maintain, capture extensive information, and are used primarily by research, military, or government organizations.

Based on design criteria, honeypots can be classified as:
* pure honeypots
* high-interaction honeypots
* low-interaction honeypots

Pure honeypots are full-fledged production systems. The activities of the attacker are monitored by using a bug tap that has been installed on the honeypot&#x27;s link to the network. No other software needs to be installed. Even though a pure honeypot is useful, the stealthiness of the defense mechanisms can be ensured by a more controlled mechanism.

High-interaction honeypots imitate the activities of the production systems that host a variety of services and, therefore, an attacker may be allowed a lot of services to waste their time. By employing virtual machines, multiple honeypots can be hosted on a single physical machine. Therefore, even if the honeypot is compromised, it can be restored more quickly. In general, high-interaction honeypots provide more security by being difficult to detect, but they are expensive to maintain. If virtual machines are not available, one physical computer must be maintained for each honeypot, which can be exorbitantly expensive. Example: Honeynet.

Low-interaction honeypots simulate only the services frequently requested by attackers. Since they consume relatively few resources, multiple virtual machines can easily be hosted on one physical system, the virtual systems have a short response time, and less code is required, reducing the complexity of the virtual system&#x27;s security. Example: Honeyd. This type of honeypot was one of the first types being created in the late nineties and was mainly used for detecting attacks, not studying them.

Sugarcane is a type of honeypot that masquerades as an open proxy. It can often take form as a server designed to look like a misconfigured HTTP proxy. Probably the most famous open proxy was the default configuration of sendmail (before version 8.9.0 in 1998) which would forward email to and from any destination.

=== Deception technology ===
Recently, a new market segment called deception technology has emerged using basic honeypot technology with the addition of advanced automation for scale. Deception technology addresses the automated deployment of honeypot resources over a large commercial enterprise or government institution.

=== Malware honeypots ===
A malware honeypot is a decoy designed to intentionally attract malicious software. It does this by imitating a vulnerable system or network, such as a web server. The honeypot is intentionally set up with security flaws that look to invite these malware attacks. Once attacked IT teams can then analyze the malware to better understand where it comes from and how it acts.

=== Spam versions ===
Spammers abuse vulnerable resources such as open mail relays and open proxies. These are servers that accept e-mail from anyone on the Internet—including spammers—and send it to its destination. Some system administrators have created honeypot programs that masquerade as these abusable resources to discover spammer activity.

There are several capabilities such honeypots provide to these administrators, and the existence of such fake abusable systems makes abuse more difficult or risky. Honeypots can be a powerful countermeasure to abuse from those who rely on very high-volume abuse (e.g., spammers).

These honeypots can reveal the abuser&#x27;s IP address and provide bulk spam capture (which enables operators to determine spammers&#x27; URLs and response mechanisms). As described by M. Edwards at ITPRo Today:

The apparent source may be another abused system. Spammers and other abusers may use a chain of such abused systems to make detection of the original starting point of the abuse traffic difficult.

This in itself is indicative of the power of honeypots as anti-spam tools. In the early days of anti-spam honeypots, spammers, with little concern for hiding their location, felt safe testing for vulnerabilities and sending spam directly from their own systems. Honeypots made the abuse riskier and more difficult.

Spam still flows through open relays, but the volume is much smaller than in 2001-02. While most spam originates in the U.S., spammers hop through open relays across political boundaries to mask their origin. Honeypot operators may use intercepted relay tests to recognize and thwart attempts to relay spam through their honeypots. &quot;Thwart&quot; may mean &quot;accept the relay spam but decline to deliver it.&quot; Honeypot operators may discover other details concerning the spam and the spammer by examining the captured spam messages.

Open-relay honeypots include Jackpot, written in Java by Jack Cleaver; &quot;smtpot.py&quot;, written in Python by Karl A. Krueger; and spamhole, written in C. The &quot;Bubblegum Proxypot&quot; is an open-source honeypot (or &quot;proxypot&quot;).

=== Email trap ===

An email address that is not used for any other purpose than to receive spam can also be considered a spam honeypot. Compared with the term &quot;spamtrap&quot;, the term &quot;honeypot&quot; might be more suitable for systems and techniques that are used to detect or counterattack probes. With a spamtrap, spam arrives at its destination &quot;legitimately&quot;—exactly as non-spam email would arrive.

An amalgam of these techniques is Project Honey Pot, a distributed, open-source project that uses honeypot pages installed on websites around the world. These honeypot pages disseminate uniquely tagged spamtrap email addresses and spammers can then be tracked—the corresponding spam mail is subsequently sent to these spamtrap e-mail addresses.

=== Database honeypot ===
Databases often get attacked by intruders using SQL injection. As such activities are not recognized by basic firewalls, companies often use database firewalls for protection. Some of the available SQL database firewalls provide/support honeypot architectures so that the intruder runs against a trap database while the web application remains functional.

=== Industrial Control Systems honeypot ===
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are often the target of cyberattacks. One of the main targets within ICS are Programmable Logic Controllers. In order to understand intruders&#x27; techniques in this context, several honeypots have been proposed. Conpot is a low interaction honeypot capable of simulation Siemens PLCs. HoneyPLC is a medium interaction honeypot that can simulate Siemens, Rockwell and other PLC brands.

== Honeypot detection ==
Just as honeypots are weapons against spammers, honeypot detection systems are spammer-employed counter-weapons. As detection systems would likely use unique characteristics of specific honeypots to identify them, such as the property-value pairs of default honeypot configuration, many honeypots in use utilise a set of unique characteristics larger and more daunting to those seeking to detect and thereby identify them. This is an unusual circumstance in software; a situation in which (a large number of versions of the same software, all differing slightly from each other) can be beneficial. There&#x27;s also an advantage in having some easy-to-detect honeypots deployed. Fred Cohen, the inventor of the Deception Toolkit, argues that every system running his honeypot should have a deception port which adversaries can use to detect the honeypot. Cohen believes that this might deter adversaries. Honeypots also allow for early detection of legitimate threats. No matter how the honeypot detects the exploit, it can alert you immediately to the attempted attack.

== Risks ==
The goal of honeypots is to attract and engage attackers for a sufficiently long period to obtain high-level Indicators of Compromise (IoC) such as attack tools and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Thus, a honeypot needs to emulate essential services in the production network and grant the attacker the freedom to perform adversarial activities to increase its attractiveness to the attacker. Although the honeypot is a controlled environment and can be monitored by using tools such as honeywall, attackers may still be able to use some honeypots as pivot nodes to penetrate production systems.

The second risk of honeypots is that they may attract legitimate users due to a lack of communication in large-scale enterprise networks. For example, the security team who applies and monitors the honeypot may not disclose the honeypot location to all users in time due to the lack of communication or the prevention of insider threats.

== Honey nets ==

Two or more honeypots on a network form a &quot;honey net&quot;. Typically, a honey net is used for monitoring a larger and/or more diverse network in which one honeypot may not be sufficient. Honey nets and honeypots are usually implemented as parts of larger network intrusion detection systems. A &quot;honey farm&quot; is a centralized collection of honeypots and analysis tools.

The concept of the honey net first began in 1999 when Lance Spitzner, founder of the Honeynet Project, published the paper &quot;To Build a Honeypot&quot;.

== History ==
An early formulation of the concept, called &quot;entrapment&quot;, is defined in FIPS 39 (1976) as &quot;the deliberate planting of apparent flaws in a system for the purpose of detecting attempted penetrations or confusing an intruder about which flaws to exploit&quot;.

The earliest honeypot techniques are described in Clifford Stoll&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot;.

One of the earliest documented cases of the cybersecurity use of a honeypot began in January 1991. On January 7, 1991, while he worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Cheswick observed a criminal hacker, known as a cracker, attempting to obtain a copy of a password file. Cheswick wrote that he and colleagues constructed a &quot;chroot &quot;Jail&quot; (or &quot;roach motel&quot;)&quot; which allowed them to observe their attacker over a period of several months.

In 2017, Dutch police used honeypot techniques to track down users of the darknet market Hansa.

The metaphor of a bear being attracted to and stealing honey is common in many traditions, including Germanic, Celtic, and Slavic. A common Slavic word for the bear is &quot;medved&quot; &quot;honey eater&quot;. The tradition of bears stealing honey has been passed down through stories and folklore, especially the well known Winnie the Pooh.

<text>The United States expedition to Korea, known in Korea as the Shinmiyangyo () or simply the Korean Expedition, was an American military action in Korea that took place predominantly on and around Ganghwa Island in 1871.

== Background ==

Frederick Low, the American ambassador to China, sent the mission to ascertain the fate of the merchant ship &quot;General Sherman&quot;, which had gone missing while visiting Korea in 1866. According to a &quot;National Interest&quot; article, Low&#x27;s own records indicated the punitive campaign was motivated by a need to demonstrate American power over what he considered to be a weaker nation. Previously, the American commanders had felt entitled. They would &quot;peacefully&quot; enter Korean waters for survey and trade aboard heavily armed warships, all the while ignoring repeated diplomatic requests to respect Korean sovereignty.

Korean officials had sent letters holding the Americans responsible for unlawfully sending warships into their territorial waters, and also explaining to Low what had happened to the General Sherman. The governor of Ganghwa also sent what Low described as a &quot;few worthless articles&quot;—three cows, 50 chickens and 1,000 eggs—in an effort to de-escalate things. The Americans rejected the offer. Instead, they launched a punitive campaign after the commanding American admiral did not receive an official apology from the Koreans. The isolationist nature of the Joseon dynasty government and the imperialistic nature of the Americans transformed a diplomatic expedition into an armed conflict.

==Initial contact==
The American expedition consisted of about 650 men, more than 500 sailors and 100 Marines, as well as five warships: , , , , and . Embarked aboard &quot;Colorado&quot; was Rear Admiral John Rodgers, and Frederick F. Low, the United States Ambassador to China. The Korean forces, known as &quot;Tiger Hunters&quot;, were led by General Eo Jae-yeon.

The Americans safely made contact with the Korean inhabitants, described as &quot;people wearing white clothes&quot;. When they inquired about the General Sherman incident, the Koreans were initially reluctant to discuss the topic, ostensibly to avoid having to pay recompense. The Americans consequently let the Koreans know that their fleet would be exploring the area and that they meant no harm. This gesture was misinterpreted; Korean policy at the time prohibited foreign ships from sailing on the Han River, which led directly to the capital city of Hanyang, modern-day Seoul. Therefore, the Joseon government rejected the U.S. request. The Americans sailed anyway.

On 1 June, the Korean fortress fired at the U.S. fleet as it sailed up the Ganghwa Straits, which leads to the river. The U.S. forces were not badly damaged due to &quot;the bad gunnery of the [K]oreans, whose fire, although very hot for the fifteen minutes in which they maintained it, was ill-directed, and consequently without effect.&quot; The U.S. demanded an apology within 10 days; there was no response so Rodgers decided on a punitive assault on the forts.

==Battle of Ganghwa==

On 10 June, the Americans attacked the lightly defended Choji Garrison on Ganghwa, along the Salee River. The Koreans were armed with severely outdated weapons, such as matchlock muskets, cannons, and breech-loading swivel guns. After overrunning the Korean defenders, the Americans moved on to their next objective, the Deokjin Garrison. American 12-pound howitzers kept the poorly armed Korean forces from effective range. The American troops continued towards the next objective, Deokjin Fort, which they found abandoned. The sailors and Marines quickly dismantled this fortress and continued to Gwangseong Garrison, a citadel. By this time, Korean forces had regrouped there. Along the way, some Korean units tried to flank the U.S. forces but were beaten off again due to the strategic placement of artillery on two hills.

Artillery fire from ground forces and &quot;Monocacy&quot; offshore pounded the citadel in preparation for an assault by U.S. forces. A force of 546 sailors and 105 Marines grouped on the hills west of the fortress (infantry troops were on the hill directly west of the fortress, while artillery troops on another hill both shelled the fortress and also covered the Americans&#x27; flanks and rear), keeping cover and returning fire. Once the bombardment stopped, the Americans charged the citadel, led by Lieutenant Hugh McKee. The slow reload time of the Korean matchlocks aided the Americans, armed with superior Remington rolling block carbines, in making it over the walls; the Koreans even ended up throwing rocks at the attackers.

McKee was the first to make it into the citadel and was fatally wounded by a shot to the groin; after him came commander Winfield Scott Schley, who shot the Korean soldier who had killed McKee. The flag of the Korean commander, General Eo Jae-yŏn, called the &quot;Sujagi&quot; by Koreans, was captured by Corporal Charles Brown of &quot;Colorado&quot;″s guard and Private Hugh Purvis of &quot;Alaska&quot;″s guard. General Eo was killed by Private James Dougherty. While serving as the color bearer for &quot;Colorado&quot;″s crew and Marines, &quot;Colorado&quot; Carpenter Cyrus Hayden planted the U.S. flag on the ramparts under heavy enemy fire. Corporal Brown, Privates Dougherty, Purvis, and Carpenter Hayden received the Medal of Honor.

The fighting lasted fifteen minutes. The total number killed was 243 Koreans and three Americans; McKee, Seaman Seth Allen, and U.S. Marine Corps Private Denis Hanrahan. Ten Americans were wounded, and 20 Koreans were captured, several of whom were wounded. Five Korean forts were taken in total, with dozens of small cannons. The Korean deputy commander was among the wounded who were captured. The U.S. hoped to use the captives as a bargaining chip to meet with local officials, but the Koreans refused, calling the captives cowards and &quot;Low was told that he was welcome to keep the wounded prisoners.&quot; However, the Americans released the prisoners before departing.

Following the military operations of 10–12 June, the United States Asiatic Squadron stayed at anchorage off Jakyak Island until 3 July, when they left for China.

==Aftermath==
The United States had hoped that their victory would persuade the Koreans to return to the negotiating table. But the Koreans refused to negotiate. In fact, these events led the regent Daewon-gun to strengthen his policy of isolation and issue a national proclamation against appeasing foreigners. Additionally the Koreans soon sent reinforcements in large numbers that were armed with more modern weapons to confront the American troops. Realizing that the odds had shifted, the U.S. fleet consequently departed and set sail for China on 3 July.

There were no further attacks on foreign ships. In 1876, Korea established a trade treaty with Japan after Japanese ships approached Ganghwa Island and threatened to fire on Seoul. Treaties with European countries and the U.S. soon followed.

Nine sailors (Chief Quartermaster Grace, Quartermasters Troy, Franklin and Rogers, Boatswain&#x27;s Mate McKenzie, Ordinary Seaman Andrews, Carpenter Hayden, and Landsmen Lukes and Merton) and six Marines (Corporal Brown and Privates Coleman, Dougherty, McNamara, Owens, and Purvis) were awarded the Medal of Honor, the first for actions in a foreign conflict.

==Treaty of Amity and Commerce==
From April–May 1882, the United States, represented by Commodore Robert W. Shufeldt of the United States Navy, and Korea negotiated and approved a 14-article treaty. The treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for American citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status.

The treaty remained in effect until the annexation of Korea in 1910.

<text>Ellen Anderson Gholson Glasgow (April 22, 1873 – November 21, 1945) was an American novelist who won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1942 for her novel &quot;In This Our Life&quot;. She published 20 novels, as well as short stories, to critical acclaim. A lifelong Virginian, Glasgow portrayed the changing world of the contemporary South in a realistic manner, differing from the idealistic escapism that characterized Southern literature after Reconstruction.

==Early and family life==
Born in Richmond, Virginia, on April 22, 1873, to Anne Jane Gholson (1831-1893) and her husband, Francis Thomas Glasgow, the young Glasgow developed differently from other women of her aristocratic class. Due to poor health (later diagnosed as chronic heart disease), Glasgow was educated at home in Richmond, receiving the equivalent of a high school degree, although she read deeply in philosophy, social and political theory, as well as European and British literature.

Her parents married on July 14, 1853, survived the American Civil War, and would have ten children together, of whom Ellen would be the next to youngest. Her mother, Anne Gholson, was inclined to what was then called &quot;nervous invalidism&quot;; which some attributed to her having borne and cared for ten children. Glasgow also dealt with &quot;nervous invalidism&quot; throughout her life. Ellen Glasgow thought her father self-righteous and unfeeling. However, some of her more admirable characters reflect a Scots-Calvinist background like his and a similar &quot;iron vein of Presbyterianism&quot;.

Ellen Glasgow spent many summers at her family&#x27;s Louisa County, Virginia, estate, the historic Jerdone Castle plantation, which her father bought in 1879, and would later use that setting in her writings.

Her paternal great-grandfather, Arthur Glasgow, had emigrated with his brothers in 1776 from Scotland to the then-large and frontier Augusta County, Virginia. Her father, Francis Thomas Glasgow, was raised in what had become Rockbridge County, Virginia, graduated from Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in 1847, and would eventually manage the Tredegar Iron Works. Those had been bought in 1848 by Glasgow&#x27;s maternal uncle, Joseph Reid Anderson, who had graduated fourth in his class of 49 from West Point in 1836 and would introduce the labor of skilled and enslaved Africans at the ironworks to accompany skilled white workers. Anderson was a major business and political figure in Richmond, who supported the Confederate States of America, joined the Army of Northern Virginia, and attained the rank of general. However, because the Tredegar Ironworks produced munitions crucial to the Confederate cause, General Robert E. Lee asked General Anderson to return and manage the ironworks rather than lead armies in the field.

Her mother was Anne Jane Gholson (1831-1893), born to William Yates Gholson and Martha Anne Jane Taylor at Needham plantation in Cumberland County, Virginia. Her grandparents were Congressman Thomas Gholson, Jr. and Anne Yates, who descended from Rev. William Yates, the College of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s fifth president (1761–1764). Gholson was descended from William Randolph, a prominent colonist and land owner in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He and his wife, Mary Isham, were sometimes referred to as the &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; of Virginia.

==Career==
During more than four decades of literary work, Glasgow published 20 novels, a collection of poems, a book of short stories, and a book of literary criticism. Her first novel, &quot;The Descendant&quot; (1897) was written in secret and published anonymously when she was 24 years old. She destroyed part of the manuscript after her mother died in 1893. Publication was further delayed because her brother-in-law and intellectual mentor, George McCormack, died the following year. Thus Glasgow completed her novel in 1895. It features an emancipated heroine who seeks passion rather than marriage. Although it was published anonymously, her authorship became well known the following year, when her second novel, &quot;Phases of an Inferior Planet&quot; (1898), announced on its title page, &quot;by Ellen Glasgow, author of &quot;The Descendant&quot;&quot;.

By the time &quot;The Descendant&quot; was in print, Glasgow had finished &quot;Phases of an Inferior Planet&quot;. The novel portrays the demise of a marriage and focuses on &quot;the spirituality of female friendship&quot;. Critics found the story to be &quot;sodden with hopelessness all the way though&quot;, but &quot;excellently told&quot;. Glasgow stated that her third novel, &quot;The Voice of People&quot; (1900) was an objective view of the poor-white farmer in politics. The hero is a young Southerner who, having a genius for politics, rises above the masses and falls in love with a higher class girl. Her next novel, &quot;The Battle-Ground&quot; (1902), sold over 21,000 copies in the first two weeks after publication. It depicts the South before and during the Civil War and was hailed as &quot;the first and best realistic treatment of the war from the southern point of view.&quot;

Much of her work was influenced by the romantic interests and human relationships that Glasgow developed throughout her life. &quot;The Deliverance&quot; (1904) and her previous novel, &quot;The Battle-Ground&quot;, were written during her affair with &quot;Gerald B.&quot;, her long-time secret lover. They &quot;are the only early books in which Glasgow&#x27;s heroine and hero are united&quot; by the novels&#x27; ends. &quot;The Deliverance&quot;, published in 1904, was the first Glasgow book to garner popular success. The novel portrays a romance built on the dramatic relationship between the hero and the heroine due to traditional class constraints. The hero is an aristocrat turned into a common laborer after the events of the Civil War, and the heroine lacks the aristocratic lineage but obtains aristocratic qualities such as education and refinement. The genuine affection and reconciliation of the romance of the two were attempts by Glasgow to prove that &quot;traditional class consciousness should be inconsequential to love affairs.&quot; &quot;The Deliverance&quot; criticizes the institution of marriage because Glasgow herself faced social barriers that prevented her from marrying at that time. &quot;The Deliverance&quot; is notable for offering &quot;a naturalistic treatment of class conflicts&quot; that emerge after Reconstruction, providing realistic views of social changes in Southern literature.

Glasgow&#x27;s next four novels were written in what she considered her &quot;earlier manner&quot; and received mixed reviews. &quot;The Wheel of Life&quot; (1906) sold moderately well based on the success of &quot;The Descendant&quot;. Despite its commercial success, however, reviewers found the book disappointing. Set in New York (the only novel not set in Virginia), the story tells of domestic unhappiness and tangled love affairs. It was unfavorably compared to Edith Wharton&#x27;s &quot;House of Mirth&quot;, which was published that same year. Most critics recommended that Glasgow &quot;stick to the South&quot;. Glasgow regarded the novel as a failure.

&quot;The Ancient Law&quot; (1908) portrayed white factory workers in the Virginia textile industry, and analyzes the rise of industrial capitalism and its corresponding social ills. Critics considered the book overly melodramatic. With &quot;The Romance of a Plain Man&quot; (1909) and &quot;The Miller of Old Church&quot; (1911) Glasgow began concentrating on gender traditions; she contrasted the conventions of the Southern woman with the feminist viewpoint, a direction which she continued in &quot;Virginia&quot; (1913).

As the United States women&#x27;s suffrage movement was developing in the early 1900s, Glasgow marched in the English suffrage parades in the spring of 1909. Later she spoke at the first suffrage meeting in Virginia and was an early member of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia. Glasgow felt that the movement came &quot;at the wrong moment&quot; for her, and her participation and interest waned. Glasgow did not at first make women&#x27;s roles her major theme, and she was slow to place heroines rather than heroes at the centers of her stories. Some called her &quot;Virginia&quot; (1913; about a southern lady whose husband abandons her when he achieves success), &quot;Life and Gabriella&quot; (1916; about a woman abandoned by a weak-willed husband, but who becomes a self-sufficient, single mother who remarries well), and &quot;Barren Ground&quot; (1925); discussed below, her &quot;women&#x27;s trilogy&quot;. Her later works have heroines who display many of the attributes of women involved in the political movement.
Glasgow published two more novels, &quot;The Builders&quot; (1919) and &quot;One Man in His Time&quot; (1922), as well as a set of short stories (&quot;The Shadowy Third and Other Stories&quot; (1923)), before producing her novel of greatest personal importance, &quot;Barren Ground&quot; (1925).

Written in response to her waning romantic relationship with Henry W. Anderson, &quot;Barren Ground&quot; is a story that chronicles the life events of the main heroine. Due to a troubled childhood, the heroine looks for escape in the form of companionship with the opposite sex. She meets a man and gets engaged, only for him to leave for New York and desert her. The heroine concludes that physical relationships with the opposite sex are meaningless and devotes herself to running her farm. Though she triumphs over the man who abandoned her, the victory is as bare and empty as the barren ground in the description of the introduction. Glasgow wrote &quot;Barren Ground&quot; in retrospect to her own life, and the heroine&#x27;s life mirrors hers almost exactly. Glasgow reverses the traditional seduction plot by producing a heroine completely freed from the southern patriarchal influence and pits women against their own biological natures. Though she created an unnatural and melodramatic story that did not sell well with the public, it was hailed as a literary accomplishment by critics of the time. The imagery, descriptive power, and length of the book conveys the &quot;unconquerable vastness&quot; of the world. What endures in the novel is not the ideals of a cynical woman, but rather the landscape that is farmed by generations of humans who spend their brief time on earth on the land. Glasgow portrays the insignificance of human relationships and romance by contrasting it directly to the vastness of nature itself.

By writing &quot;Barren Ground&quot;, a &quot;tragedy&quot;, she believed that she freed herself for her comedies of manners &quot;The Romantic Comedians&quot; (1926), &quot;They Stooped to Folly&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Sheltered Life&quot; (1932). These late works are considered the most artful criticism of romantic illusion in her career.

In 1923 a reviewer in &quot;Time&quot; characterized Glasgow:

She is of the South; but she is not by any manner of means provincial. She was educated, being a delicate child, at home and at private schools. Yet she is by no means a woman secluded from life. She has wide contacts and interests. ... Here is a really important figure in the history of American letters; for she has preserved for us the quality and the beauty of her real South.

Artistic recognition of her work may have climaxed in 1931 when Glasgow presided over the Southern Writers Conference at the University of Virginia.

Glasgow produced two more &quot;novels of character&quot;, &quot;The Sheltered Life&quot; (1932) and &quot;Vein of Iron&quot; (1935), in which she continued to explore female independence. The latter and &quot;Barren Ground&quot; of the previous decade remain in print.

In 1941 Glasgow published &quot;In This Our Life&quot;, the first of her writings to take a bold and progressive attitude towards black people. Glasgow incorporated African Americans into the story as main characters of the narrative, and these characters become a theme within the novel itself. By portraying the blatant injustices that black people face in society, Glasgow provides a sense of realism in race relations that she had never done before. Due to the ambiguity of the ending, the novel received a mixed and confused response from the public. There is also a distinct discontinuity between critics of the time and the reading public, as the critics, notably her friends, hailed the novel as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, and the novel won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1942. The novel was quickly bought by Warner Brothers and adapted as a movie by the same name, directed by John Huston and released in 1942.

Her autobiography, &quot;The Woman Within&quot;, published in 1954, years after her death, details her progression as an author and the influences essential for her becoming an acclaimed Southern woman writer. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was gathering information for her commissioned biography of Ellen Glasgow prior to her death.

==Death and legacy==
Glasgow died in her sleep at home on November 21, 1945, and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia. The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia maintains Glasgow&#x27;s papers. Copies of Glasgow&#x27;s correspondence may be found in the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings papers at the George A. Smathers Libraries Special Collections at the University of Florida. The Library of Virginia honored Glasgow in 2000 as she became a member of the inaugural class of Virginia Women in History.

By basing her novels on her own life, Glasgow accurately portrayed the changing nature of Southern society. She was the founder of the realism movement in Southern literature that was made up of writers such as William Faulkner, who considered Reconstruction as &quot;the greatest humiliation in Southern history.&quot;

===Personal life and relationships===
Glasgow had several love interests during her life. In &quot;The Woman Within&quot; (1954), an autobiography written for posthumous publication, Glasgow tells of a long, secret affair with a married man she had met in New York City in 1900, whom she called Gerald B. Ellen believed that he was the &quot;one great love of her life&quot;, noting one particular visit with him in Switzerland:A summer morning in the Alps. We were walking together over an emerald path. I remember the moss, the ferny greenness. I remember the Alpine blue of the sky. I remember, on my lips, the flushed air tasting like honey. The way was through a thick wood, in a park, and the path wound on and upward, higher and higher. We walked slowly, scarcely breathing in the brilliant light. On and upward, higher, and still higher. Then, suddenly, the trees parted, the woods thinned and disappeared. Earth and sky met and mingled. We stood, hand in hand, alone in the solitude, alone with the radiant whiteness of the Jungfrau. From the mountain we turned our eyes to each other. We were silent, because it seemed to us that all had been said. But the thought flashed through my mind, and was gone, &quot;Never in all my life can I be happier than I am, now, here at this moment!&quot; Since Gerald B.&#x27;s wife would not agree to a divorce, Ellen was unable to marry. In the end, nothing occurred but the short-lived meetings in New York and Switzerland; Glasgow wrote in her autobiography that Gerald B. died in 1905.

Ellen also maintained a close lifelong friendship with James Branch Cabell, another notable Richmond writer. She was engaged twice but did not marry. In 1916, Glasgow met Henry W. Anderson, a prominent attorney and Republican Party leader, who collaborated with Glasgow and provided copies of his speeches for her novel &quot;The Builders&quot;. He eventually became her fiance in 1917. However, the engagement occurred during the First World War, and Anderson, placed in charge of the Red Cross Commission in order to keep Romania on the side of the Allies, left for the country. There he met Queen Marie of Romania, and Anderson became infatuated with her. These developments, paired with a lack of communication between the two, strained the relationship between Glasgow and Anderson, and the planned marriage fell through. Based on her experiences, Glasgow felt her best work was done when love was over. By the end of her life, Glasgow lived with her secretary, Anne V. Bennett, 10 years her junior, at her home at 1 West Main Street in Richmond.

<doc id="287966" wikidata="Q1346915" url="?curid=287966" title="Rocco Prestia">
<text>Francis Rocco Prestia Jr. (March 7, 1951 – September 29, 2020) was an American bassist, best known for his work with the funk band Tower of Power.

==Biography==
Born in Sonora, California, Prestia started playing electric guitar as an adolescent. When he auditioned for Emilio Castillo&#x27;s band, Tower of Power, Castillo persuaded him to switch to electric bass.

Prestia worked with the band for the next three decades, before he became seriously ill in 2001. His fans and friends created a foundation in order to help pay the artist&#x27;s medical costs. On December 5, 2014, Prestia underwent successful liver transplant surgery.

Rocco is survived by the loves of his life, Julian Francis Rocco Prestia and Alicia-Lyn JoAnn Prestia.

==Technique and influences==
Prestia was a master of fingerstyle funk bass playing. His technique made heavy use of left hand muting. He muted his strings lightly to create a thick percussive sound while maintaining pitch clarity. He also frequently incorporated ghost notes to fill empty space. His characteristic sound, in combination with a highly rhythmic approach to bass lines, makes Prestia&#x27;s sound unmistakable.

Along with James Jamerson, Stanley Clarke, Anthony Jackson and Alphonso Johnson, Prestia belonged to a generation of musicians that fostered a revolution on the electric bass—inspiring the innovative work of Jaco Pastorius in the mid-1970s. Prestia&#x27;s influential style can be heard on classic Tower of Power tracks such as the 1973 hit &quot;What is Hip&quot;. Prestia cited James Jamerson and the different musicians who worked for James Brown (particularly Bootsy Collins) as his main influences.

==Equipment==
Prestia&#x27;s primary instruments were his Fender Precision basses (a purple transparent American Deluxe and a natural ash-bodied short-lived signature model with a reverse split pickup and a 2-band EQ). He later maintained an association with the Conklin company that provided him a custom built four-string instrument, one of the few in the company&#x27;s catalog.

In January 2013, ESP Guitars announced that Prestia had joined their roster of endorsing artists. The company made reference to the introduction of their LTD RB series on May 22, 2014.

==Death==
Prestia died on September 29, 2020, at age 69, in a Las Vegas hospice.

<doc id="287967" wikidata="Q1191335" url="?curid=287967" title="Colgate University">
<text>Colgate University is a private college in Hamilton, New York, United States. The liberal arts college was founded in 1819 as the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York and operated under that name until 1823, when it was renamed Hamilton Theological and Literary Institution, often called Hamilton College (1823–1846), then Madison College (1846–1890), and its present name since 1890.

Colgate enrolls approximately 3,200 students in 56 undergraduate majors that culminate in a Bachelor of Arts degree. The student body is 54% female and 46% male students who participate in over 200 clubs and organizations. While Colgate offers almost an entirely undergraduate program, it also has a small graduate program in Master of Arts in Teaching. The college competes in NCAA Division I sports and is part of the Patriot League athletic conference and ECAC Hockey.

== History ==
In 1817, the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York was founded by thirteen men (six clergymen and seven laymen). Two years later, in 1819, the state granted the school&#x27;s charter, and the school opened a year later, in 1820. The first classes were held in a building in the town of Hamilton. Three years later, in 1823, the Baptist Theological Seminary at New York City incorporated with the Baptist Education Society and subsequently changed its name to the Hamilton Literary &amp; Theological Institution. Among the trustees was William Colgate, founder of the Colgate Company.

In 1826, the school&#x27;s trustees bought farmland that later became the focal point of the campus, known as &quot;The Hill&quot;. One year later, the current students and faculty of the school built West Hall, using stone taken from a quarry found on the land. Originally called West Edifice before being renamed to West Hall, it is the oldest structure on campus. On March 26, 1846, the State of New York granted a college charter to Hamilton&#x27;s Collegiate Department; in the two years prior to that, at the request of Hamilton trustees, degrees of forty-five Bachelor&#x27;s students and at least one Master&#x27;s candidate were awarded by Columbian College in Washington, D.C. (now the George Washington University), a fellow Baptist institution. In 1846, the school changed its name to Madison University. In 1850, the Baptist Education Society planned to move the university to Rochester, but was halted by legal action. Dissenting trustees, faculty, and students founded the University of Rochester. Another group of Baptist dissenters, calling for an end to racial and gender discrimination, had founded New-York Central College in 1849. In 1890, Madison University changed its name to Colgate University in recognition of the family and its gifts to the school. James B. Colgate, one of William Colgate&#x27;s sons, established a $1 million endowment called the Dodge Memorial Fund. In 1912 Colgate Academy, a preparatory school and high school that had operated in Hamilton since the early 1800s, was closed and its facility became Colgate University&#x27;s administration building. 

During World War II, Colgate University was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

Beginning with undergraduate students admitted in 2022, Colgate plans to be fully tuition-free for students from families making $80,000 or less, cost between 5 and 10% of income for families making between $80,000 and $150,000, and meet 100% of demonstrated need for students from families making more than $150,000.

=== Coeducation ===
At its inception, the institution was an all-male institution but started to see female students attend in a limited capacity as early as the mid-1800s when Emily Taylor, daughter of then-president Stephen W. Taylor (1851–56), attended her father&#x27;s moral philosophy class.

The institution&#x27;s first full-time female student was Mabel Dart (later Colegrove), who participated in classes from 1878 to 1882. At the time, university officials deemed it best that a female student not be embarrassed by graduating from an all-male college, and made arrangements for Dart to officially receive her degree from then all-female Vassar College.

In the ensuing years, additional female students participated in courses, including faculty spouses and the wives of enrolled veterans in the post-WWII era. Colgate became fully coeducational in 1970.

=== President Cutten&#x27;s controversial legacies ===
The national monument at Ellis Island displays a statement by Colgate&#x27;s eighth President, George Barton Cutten, which has been criticized for its jingoistic anti-immigration sentiment. He warned, &quot;The danger [that] the &#x27;melting pot&#x27; brings to the nation is the breeding out of the higher divisions of the white race.&quot;

While Cutten&#x27;s legacy has been marred by the espousal of racist beliefs, the contributions he made to developing the prestige and facilities of Colgate were significant. Student protests in 2006 around campus facilities bearing Cutten&#x27;s name became emblematic of the division surrounding how modern American universities should reconcile their own history with racism, foreshadowing future controversies in the mid-2010s at universities such as Yale University and Harvard University. Colgate removed the Cutten name from a residential complex located between Whitnall Field and Huntington Gym in 2017. Each of the four houses that compose the building—Brigham, Shepardson, Read, and Whitnall—is now known by its existing name and street address, 113 Broad Street.

== Campus ==
Colgate University is located in the rural village of Hamilton Village, Hamilton, New York. The campus is situated on of land. The university owns an additional of undeveloped forested lands.

Colgate&#x27;s first building, West Hall, was built by students and faculty from stones from Colgate&#x27;s own rock quarry. Nearly all the buildings on campus are built of stone, and newer buildings are built with materials that fit the style. Old Biology Hall (now renamed to Hascall Hall) was built in 1884 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The principal campus plan was created by Ernest W. Bowditch in 1891–1893, drawing on earlier recommendations by Frederick Law Olmsted.

Probably the most distinctive building on campus is Colgate Memorial Chapel, which was built in 1918 and is used for lectures, performances, concerts, and religious services.

Most of the campus&#x27;s heat is generated from a wood boiler which burns wood chips, a renewable resource. Almost all of Colgate&#x27;s electricity comes from a hydroelectric dam at Niagara Falls; the rest comes from nuclear sources. The campus also has a Green Bikes program with over two dozen bikes that are loaned out in an effort to encourage students to rely less on cars. Colgate Dining Services currently provides organic rice, beans, and other dry foods, and is working to offer more local foods options. Dining Services take-out containers are also made from natural materials, and are compostable. &quot;On August 13, Colgate received a perfect sustainability score from the Princeton Review. As a result, it was recognized as one of only 24 schools (out of 861 evaluated) to make their Green Honor Roll.

=== Outreach ===
Colgate founded the Upstate Institute in 2003. The institute was created to connect the Colgate community to its surrounding region, as well as to give back and help economically and socially sustain the area. Currently, they do research on counties in the area, as well as support outreach and volunteer organizations.

Colgate was an initial sponsor of Partnership for Community Development, a local nonprofit organization which seeks to support the community through the revitalization of buildings and small business development.

Colgate administers Chapel House, a non-denominational retreat and meditation garden. Opened in 1959, the building was designed by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill and is an example of late international-style modernism.

===Longyear Museum of Anthropology===
The Longyear Museum of Anthropology is part of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Colgate University. The Longyear Museum exhibition gallery is centrally located in Alumni Hall on campus. 

===Picker Art Gallery===

The Picker Art Gallery is a fine arts museum that is housed in the Dana Arts Center at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York. It was named after Evelyn Picker, class of &#x27;36 and trustee emeritus, and opened in 1969. The Museum houses 11,000-some art objects in its permanent collections. Highlights include old master paintings from Europe, woodblock prints from China and Japan, and a series of original photographs from famed Soviet wartime photographer Yevgeny Khaldei. 

Since 2013, there have been plans to move the Picker collection to a new facility, which Colgate University has named the Center for Art and Culture. 

====Exhibitions====
In 2013, the Picker Art Museum launched an online campaign to display works as a digital exhibition, their first being &quot;Selected Old Masters From the Picker Art Gallery&quot;. Other than this online gallery, all exhibition, and educational programs have been temporarily ceased due to the university&#x27;s thorough assessment of the works in anticipation for the move to the new Center for Arts and Culture.

===Academic journal===
Colgate University edits and publishes an international academic journal entitled &quot;Medieval &amp; Renaissance Drama in England&quot;. It was founded in 1984 and publishes academic content related to the study of drama prior to 1642. It is part of the English Department. This journal is also indexed and available on JSTOR.

== Academics ==
Colgate offers 56 undergraduate majors leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree, all of which are registered officially with the New York State Department of Education. The university also has a small Master of Arts in Teaching degree program, which graduates 3–7 students each year. Its most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (76)
::Political Science and Government (65)
::English Language and Literature (44)
::Research and Experimental Psychology (43)
::Biology/Biological Sciences (41)
::Computer Science (35)

In addition to regular campus courses, the university offers 22 semester-long off-campus study groups each year, including programs in Australia, China, Japan, India, several Western European countries, Washington, D.C., and the National Institutes of Health. 

Colgate University is among the 100 most selective colleges and universities in the United States, and is considered a Hidden Ivy as well as one of the Little Ivies. 

=== Admissions ===
For the class of 2026 (entering fall 2022), 21,261 students applied, 2,264 (12%) were admitted, and 841 matriculated. Enrolled students had an average high school GPA of 3.95 out of 4.0, with 72% of students in the top 10% of their class and 91% in top 20%. The middle 50% SAT range was 1460 to 1540, while the ACT composite range was 32 to 35. The university met 100% of the demonstrated need with financial aid. For the admitted students with a total family income of under $125,000, Colgate offers financial aid packages that involve no loan.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Colgate as the 22nd out of 211 best liberal arts colleges in the country, tied with University of Richmond.

==Administration==
On July 1, 2016 Brian Casey began serving as Colgate&#x27;s 17th president.

=== Board of trustees ===
Colgate is governed by a board of trustees composed of 35 members: 31 alumni, three parents of students, and the current president. As of June 30, 2023, Colgate&#x27;s endowment was $1.20 billion.

== Student life ==

=== Housing and student life facilities ===
Colgate has ten residence halls located on its central campus, which is often referred to as &quot;up the hill.&quot; Located near the academic buildings, freshmen live in six of these halls, whereas sophomores live in the other three, or in townhouses or one house on Broad Street. Juniors and seniors live down the hill in a number of residences, such as theme houses on Broad Street, apartment complexes or in &quot;townhouses&quot; located further away from campus. Themed houses are available for students who want to explore their interests. The Creative Arts house is geared toward creative students; Asia House is for students with interests in Asian culture. Although the university provides housing for students all four years, students can apply for off-campus housing, of which only 250 are granted the privilege through a lottery. Students involved in Greek life have the option of living in their organization&#x27;s house, though they cannot do so until their junior year.

Colgate has three dining facilities on campus that are run by Colgate Dining Services, which in turn is run by Chartwells. There is also a cafe located in Case Library that serves coffee.

The O&#x27;Connor Campus Center, commonly referred to as the Coop, serves as the center for student life and programming. Renovations on it were completed in 2004, and it now houses the offices for student organizations, a cafeteria, post office, printing center, a computer facility, as well as the new Blackmore Media Center, home to WRCU, Colgate&#x27;s radio station.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
Since the first chartered chapter in 1856, fraternities and sororities have been part of a long-standing tradition at Colgate University.

About forty-five percent of sophomores, juniors, and seniors belong to fraternities or sororities at Colgate. Students are not allowed to pledge until the fall semester of their sophomore year. , there are five fraternities (Beta Theta Pi, Delta Upsilon, Theta Chi, Phi Delta Theta, and Phi Kappa Tau) and three sororities (Gamma Phi Beta, Delta Delta Delta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) that are active on campus.

Following a number of incidents related to fraternities and sororities on campus, in 2005, the university decided to purchase the Greek houses. All but one of them agreed to sell their houses. The hold-out, Delta Kappa Epsilon, was subsequently derecognized. 

=== Student groups ===
Colgate has close to 200 student groups and organizations.

=== Media ===
WRCU is Colgate University&#x27;s student-operated radio station, broadcasting throughout central New York on 90.1 FM, and the station was re-modeled in 2010. Colgate&#x27;s student-run TV station, CUTV, broadcasts on the university&#x27;s local cable system and provides a mix of student-created content and first-run movies 24 hours a day. &quot;The Colgate Maroon-News&quot;, is the oldest college weekly in America. The first student newspaper was the &quot;Hamilton Student&quot;, launched on November 2, 1846. 

== Traditions ==
The number 13 is considered to be lucky at Colgate. It is said that Colgate was founded by thirteen men with thirteen dollars, thirteen prayers and thirteen articles. This tradition is expressed in many ways. Colgate&#x27;s address is 13 Oak Drive, and its zip code is 13346, which begins with 13 and ends with three digits that sum to 13. The Tredecim Senior Honor Society (formerly Konosioni) is composed of 13 men and 13 women. Alumni wear Colgate apparel on every Friday the 13th, which is designated as Colgate Day. In addition to this, Colgate University also enforces a 13 mile per hour speed limit on its upper campus area.

In 1936, the Colgate swim team made its first trip to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for spring break training at the Casino Pool. This became a regular tradition for Colgate that caught on with other schools across the country and proved to be the genesis of the college spring break trip.

== Athletics ==


Approximately 25% of students are involved in a varsity sport, and 80% of students are involved in some form of varsity, club, or intramural athletics. There are 25 varsity teams, over 30 club sports teams, and 18 different intramural sports. Colgate is part of NCAA Division I for all varsity sports.

The football program competes within the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The athletic teams are nicknamed the &quot;Raiders&quot;, and the traditional team colors are maroon and white, with a more recent addition of gray in the 1970s. Maroon replaced orange as the school&#x27;s primary color on March 24, 1900. Colgate is a member of the Patriot League for all varsity sports except for hockey, in which both its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams are members of ECAC Hockey.

Starting in 1932, Colgate athletics teams were called the &quot;Red Raiders&quot; in reference to the new maroon uniforms of that season&#x27;s &quot;undefeated, untied, unscored upon, and uninvited&quot; football team, which was the first to use the moniker. Apocryphal explanations for the name include the team&#x27;s ability to defeat its much larger rival, the Cornell University Big Red, or that a rainstorm caused one Colgate football team&#x27;s maroon jerseys to blend into a reddish color. Regardless, after the adoption of a Native American mascot, the school debated changing the name and mascot in the 1970s out of sensitivity to Native Americans. At that time the nickname was retained, but the mascot was changed to a hand holding a torch. In 2001, the administration acknowledged concerns that the adjective &quot;Red&quot; still had a Native American implication, and the school shortened the nickname to the &quot;Raiders&quot; starting in the 2001–02 school year. A new mascot was introduced in 2006.

Colgate University&#x27;s football team was selected to share the 1932 national championship by Parke H. Davis in 1933 and appeared in the Associated Press top-level polls in 1942 and 1977. The 1932 team was &quot;unbeaten, untied, unscored upon, and uninvited&quot;, as it registered shutouts against all nine opponents, but was not invited to the 1933 Rose Bowl. Colgate began playing in NCAA Division I-AA, now known as Division I FCS, in 1982 and made the Division I-AA (now FCS) football playoffs in 1982, 1983, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 and, most recently, 2018.

In the 2003 season, the Raiders made it to the NCAA I-AA championship game in football for the first time, where they lost to the University of Delaware. At the end of the season, their record was 15–1. At the time, they had the longest winning streak in all of Division I football, including one win over a Division I-A (now Division I FBS) team, Buffalo.

Cornell is a common rival in all sports; hockey games against Cornell are major events on campus, with students lining up for hours before the game in order to secure tickets. Colgate&#x27;s teams (with the exception of football, golf, and men&#x27;s hockey) also compete annually against Syracuse University. Cornell and Syracuse are both within two hours of Colgate&#x27;s campus. Colgate and Syracuse were once bitter rivals in football (there are some old traditions related to their games), but a variety of factors, including the splitting of Division I football into Division I FBS and Division I FCS in the late 1970s, helped end the annual game, with some exceptions (such as 2010) over the years.

=== Outdoor education ===
Colgate makes use of its rural location by having a full outdoor education program. A base camp is located on campus and allows students to rent equipment for skiing, camping, and other outdoor events. Each year, twelve to fifteen students are selected to become staffers for Outdoor Education. The training takes more than six months and includes a Wilderness First Responder certification. Incoming first-year students are offered a week-long trip called Wilderness Adventure, where they spend a week backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, tree climbing, caving or rock climbing in the Adirondacks.

== Alumni ==
Colgate has more than 34,000 living alumni. , Colgate alumni have a median starting salary of $53,700 and have a median mid-career salary of $119,000. In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Colgate 16th in colleges that produce the highest-earning graduates. As of 2009, among small schools, Colgate was the tenth-largest producer of alumni who go onto the Peace Corps.

<doc id="287969" wikidata="Q2639025" url="?curid=287969" title="The Dark Angel (Waltari novel)">
<text>The Dark Angel (original title Johannes Angelos) is a novel by Finnish author Mika Waltari about a hopeless love affair and the Fall of Constantinople. The Finnish version was originally published in 1952, with an English edition being published in Great Britain in 1953.

==Plot==
The narrator is Jean Ange, alias John Angelos, born in Avignon. Prior to the events of the novel, he had been a friend of Sultan Murad II and then also of his son, Mehmed II; but once Mehmed had begun his march to Constantinople, Ange fled there.

The novel begins as Jean Ange meets Anna Notaras in Constantinople and they fall instantly in love. At first Ange is unaware of her identity, but later he realises she is the daughter of &quot;megas doux&quot; Lucas Notaras.

Ange is committed to fight to the death on the side of the Christians against the Islamic Ottoman forces. Nevertheless, his prior relationship with Mehmed earns him constant distrust from both Latin and Greek Christians.

In the final part of the book, Jean Ange is seen to be an unreliable narrator who had concealed from the reader - and from everybody he met including his beloved Anna - the vital information that he was born in Avignon to exiled Royal Byzantine parents and actually had a valid dynastic claim on the Byzantine imperial throne. On his way to Constantinople, he had passed through the Ottoman camp - and Mehmed had let him proceed, hoping that he would press his claim and ignite a civil war inside the besieged city. But in fact, Jean kept his secret and revealed to no one his ancestry. 

Constantinople ultimately falls under Mehmed&#x27;s attack, and Anna dies while in the disguise of a soldier. Only then does Jean press his claim on the throne against Mehmed, who, astonished at Jean&#x27;s defiance and having looked forward to socialising with him, is left with little choice but to order him put to death.

Anna Notaras is a real historical character. In actuality, she did not die during the Fall of Constantinople but escaped and lived to a ripe old age as a major member of the Greek community in Italy.

==Research and writing==
The novel, written in a diary format, was inspired by a real diary by Niccolò Barbaro describing the 1453 siege of Constantinople. The character of Angelos especially had his basis on a marginal note in red ink mentioning a Greek traitor for the Turks by the name of Angelo Zacaria. Scholar visited Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, which held both a copy and the original, and read from the checkout list that Mika Waltari was the fourth one to be allowed to examine the book, on 7 November 1952.

Waltari abandoned an early draft, closer to his previous novels in structure, which was published posthumously in 1981 as .

==Reception==
&quot;Time&quot; praised Waltari as an &quot;anything but clumsy&quot; novelist with his portraiture of the battle environment, and likened the fractures forming in Constantinople&#x27;s walls to the growing division between Christians, leading to irreparable ruination. &quot;Daily News&quot; foresaw it for many readers as &quot;the most powerful and skillful of the historical novels of Mika Waltari&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, while regarding &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; as falling short of Waltari&#x27;s previous historical fiction and reliant on its subject matter for gaining readership, nevertheless commended the handling of all minor characters and &quot;Mr. Waltari&#x27;s understanding of the interplay of motives that permit Mohammed II, complete with satellites, to overthrow the ancient capital&quot;.

<doc id="287975" wikidata="Q1432990" url="?curid=287975" title="Tallahassee International Airport">
<text>Tallahassee International Airport is a city-owned airport five miles southwest of downtown Tallahassee, in Leon County, Florida, United States. It serves the state capital of Florida, and its surrounding areas; it is one of the major airports in north Florida, the others being Pensacola, Destin–Fort Walton Beach, Northwest Florida Beaches, and Jacksonville. Despite its name, it does not service any international destinations.

==History==
The airport began as Tallahassee Municipal Airport with a ceremony on April 23, 1961. The flag of the United States was presented to the City of Tallahassee by Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, World War I fighter ace and Chairman of the Board of Eastern Airlines. An aerial demonstration was performed by U.S. Army aircraft from Fort Rucker, Alabama. Tallahassee Municipal replaced the city&#x27;s first airport, Dale Mabry Field, which closed that year.

Eastern Airlines opened the airport by ferrying city, state and chamber of commerce officials. Aboard the flight were Tallahassee Mayor Joe Cordell, State Comptroller Ray Green, Tallahassee City Commissioners Davis Atkinson, George Taff, Hugh Williams, Tallahassee City Manager Arvah Hopkins, Tallahassee City Clerk-Auditor George White, Airport Manager Flagg Chittenden, and Ernest Menendez, Frank Deller, James Calhoun, John Ward and Jeff Lewis, all of the Tallahassee-Leon County Chamber of Commerce.

In June 1961, less than two months after it opened, the airport was the site of Freedom Rider protests. The airport restaurant, Savarin, was designated &quot;Whites Only&quot;, and closed rather than serve a racially-mixed group of clergy and activists. The protestors were arrested and removed, and later served prison sentences after the Supreme Court rejected their case in &quot;Dresner vs City of Tallahassee&quot; on a technicality.

From the airport&#x27;s opening until the early 1980s, the airport&#x27;s primary runway was Runway 18/36, a 6,076-foot runway with an ILS approach, enabling all-weather approaches, and a USAF certified High TACAN approach for practice by Air Force aircraft based at Tyndall AFB, near Panama City. Runway 09/27 was 4,000 feet long and supported general aviation operations. By the 1970s, the airport had scheduled flights on Eastern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, National Airlines and Southern Airways, mainly on Boeing 727s, Boeing 737s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s.

By the 1980s the terminal was becoming obsolete, and the 6,100 foot runway was too short for the Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 coming into service. Runway 09/27 was converted to a taxiway and a new Runway 09/27, 8,003 feet long with ILS, was built just to the south. A new passenger terminal was built just north of the new runway. Ground was broke on November 2, 1987 and the new terminal prompted officials to rename the airport from Tallahassee Municipal Airport to Tallahassee Regional Airport. On December 3, 1989, the city opened the $33 million terminal, and on February 20, 2000, the terminal was renamed the Ivan Munroe Terminal in honor of Tallahassee aviation pioneer Ivan Munroe. Munroe was the first man in Tallahassee to own a plane.

On July 20, 2002, FedEx Express Flight 1478 crashed a half mile short of the Runway 9 while attempting to land. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the crash was due to a combination of pilot fatigue and pilot error. All three crewmembers survived.

On June 26, 2015, Tallahassee Regional Airport was renamed Tallahassee International Airport. On June 29, 2015 the City of Tallahassee and the FAA announced the name change. International passengers are allowed to exit the airport via Tallahassee International Airport due to the facility&#x27;s full-service &quot;service port&quot; for U.S. Customs. The change allows international cargo and general aviation flights to directly come to Tallahassee, which is the leading cargo handler in the Panhandle area of Florida. Tallahassee handles 9.5 million pounds of cargo a year, more than the next city, Pensacola, which handles around 6.8 million pounds.

On January 27, 2021, the airport was struck by an EF1 tornado, causing minor damage and temporary closure to assess the damage. A small plane was flipped and minor damage was done to a hangar. No injuries were reported. 

==Facilities==
The airport covers at an elevation of 81 feet (25 m). It has two runways: 09/27 is 8,000 by 150 feet (2,438 by 46 m) and 18/36 is 7,000 by 150 ft. (2,134 by 46 m). Helicopter operations are generally confined to the Runway 18/36 area, or direct approaches to the Million Air FBO ramp area.

The Million Air FBO at the airport provides contracted fuel services to U.S. Military and Department of Defense aircraft. TLH is regularly visited by U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft, Lockheed Martin C-130 family aircraft, as well as Dornier C-146 and T-6 Texan II aircraft on training missions and practice approaches.

The terminal building is divided into two concourses, A &amp; B. All gates except for Gates A2 &amp; A4 are located on the main level of the terminal, and are equipped with jet bridges, while Gates A2 &amp; A4 are located on the lower level. 

Gate assignments:
*A1: American/JetBlue
*A3, A5, A6: American
*A4, A7: Silver
*B1, B3: Delta
*B5, B6: under construction

== Incidents ==

* On October 20, 1956, a Lockheed 18-50 Lodestar (N33368) of National Airlines landed too far down the runway while it was wet, ground-looped, and went through a ditch into some trees. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* On July 26, 2002, a Boeing 727-232F (N497FE) operating as FedEx Express Flight 1478 from Memphis was landing when the plane struck trees 3,650 feet short of the runway and hit the ground 1,000 feet later, slid an additional 1,100 feet through an open field, and came to rest 1,000 feet from the runway after hitting construction vehicles and burned out. The crash was found to be caused by crew fatigue; none of the three on board were killed.

<doc id="287987" wikidata="Q6520370" url="?curid=287987" title="Leith, Ontario">
<text>Leith is an unincorporated community in Ontario, Canada, named after Leith, Scotland. It is located on the eastern shore of the Owen Sound Bay, an inlet (sound) on the south shore of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Owen Sound Bay is a broad valley that cuts through the Niagara Escarpment. The valley preceded the last great Ice Age, but was broadened by the action of the glacial ice, then by the erosive forces of the Sydenham and Pottowatomi rivers. During his preliminary survey of Lake Huron in 1815, Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen named it &quot;Owen&#x27;s Sound&quot; for his brother, Admiral Sir Edward William Campbell Rich Owen.

Located approximately 9 kilometres northeast of the city of Owen Sound in the municipality of Meaford, Leith was established in the mid-1800s on Bothwells Creek where it empties into the Sound. John Telfer, who was appointed the Crown Land Agent for this area in 1840, bought and moved to Leith in 1846 when the settling of the community began. Leith was twice more sold, from Telfer to James Wilson of Galt in 1854, and from Wilson to Adam Ainslie in 1857. Leith is flanked by the larger Hibou Conservation Area to the west, and by the smaller Ainslie Wood Conservation area to the northeast [Grey-Sauble Conservation Authority]. Hibou boasts two natural sandy beaches, and 2.5 kilometres of nature trails across from the water. There are also many trails from the road to the water&#x27;s edge, all in close proximity to Leith. A plan to incorporate Leith was created in the 19th century but was never executed. Today Leith is a quiet hamlet with many year-round residents and some summer cottagers. Leith residents enjoy easy access to the waters of Georgian Bay.

When the wind blows from the northeast, the sound of the waves crashing along the shoreline is audible throughout the hamlet. At one time a pier capable of serving sailing ships and schooners existed on the northeast side of the mouth of Bothwells Creek. &quot;Ainslie Wharf&quot; was Adam Ainslie&#x27;s grand enterprise to make Leith a major Great Lakes port. Built in 1861 of cribbed stone and oak posts, the dock was further extended in 1870 to accommodate bigger ships. Grain and cattle, hogs and sheep, cords of maple beech and elm were shipped from this magnificent dock. However, exposure to the open Georgian Bay to the north-northeast eventually caused the destruction of the pier. November storms, winter ice and two ship disasters at the dock weakened it, eventually making it a dangerous structure which the townsfolk tore down after Ainslie&#x27;s death. All that remains in the water are a collection of old wooden pilings, serving principally as perches for waterfowl and an obstacle to pleasure boaters. A superior harbour in the city of Owen Sound, at the end of the inlet, eventually led to the demise of Leith as a commercial port. There is a small public gravel beach in Leith and public access to small craft boating from Telfer Creek. The mouth of Bothwells Creek is now protected habitat for large schools of baby trout.

Leith is renowned for the beauty of its landscape, both at the water&#x27;s edge, and in the surrounding countryside. The old Leith Church is the site of the grave of Tom Thomson, a noted Canadian landscape painter who died in mysterious circumstances at Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park in 1917. Thomson was a friend of the Group of Seven, famous landscape painters many of whose works are on permanent display at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. He grew up in Leith. Leith was also the favourite summer place for artist Carl Ahrens (1862-1936), one of Canada&#x27;s foremost landscape painters, whose works can still be viewed at the National Art Gallery in Ottawa, and other galleries throughout Canada and Britain.
In the late 1850s and early 1860s there was a grist mill and a flour mill, an oatmeal mill at Keefer&#x27;s Creek, a tannery, three stores, a distillery, a dock and several store houses, a church and cemetery, several frame houses, a hotel and stables, a tavern, and both picnic and cricket grounds, as well as a boot and shoe maker, blacksmith, four carpenters and shingle makers, a teacher and a postmaster. Mail began to arrive in Leith in 1853, and was delivered from Sydenham (Owen Sound) post office by steamboat bi-weekly to Ainslie Wharf. By 2004 only one of the stores remained and the post office had closed. Until 2013 the Bays River Restaurant operated in the building which was once the golf course club house and dance hall. On a clear day the view from the restaurant across the mouth of the Owen Sound inlet is spectacular. The scenic Bayshore Road cuts through the hamlet of Leith and continues along the shoreline for many miles, serving various small laneways for cottagers and shoreline residences.

Leith is well known for sport fishing. In 1921 sea lamprey or lamprey eel (&quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;) invaded the Great Lakes through the Welland Canal, though, significantly reducing the numbers of lake trout and whitefish. While the lake trout have largely vanished from Lake Huron, rainbow trout and salmon still exist in the lake. Since 1988 a species native to Asia, zebra mussels (&quot;Dreissena polymorpha&quot;), have invaded the Great Lakes, and the Owen Sound area has not been spared. Swimmers at Leith have received cuts to their bare feet from the very sharp shells of these little molluscs. In the 1990s the Great Lakes were again invaded by the round goby, a small bottom-dwelling fish, which feasts on zebra mussels along with fish eggs and native baby trout. Round gobies can often be observed feeding in the shallow waters at the bridge over Bothwells Creek in Leith. The zebra mussel population has been kept at bay.

An area on the Georgian Bay water between Owen Sound and Leith, simply marked with a green buoy, is known by local salmon and trout anglers as &quot;Thomson&#x27;s Hole&quot;. The fishing hole has garnered some of the area&#x27;s best fishing and is a popular fishing stop during the Owen Sound Salmon Spectacular Derby. The fishing hole is known for its extreme depth and its plentiful fishing but is also a popular sailing area.

In 1997, a stained glass window designed by Ellen Simon entitled &quot;Nativity Scene&quot; circa 1954 in the United Church in Leith was illustrated on the U.S.-rate Canada Postage stamp in the Christmas series. The window remains in the Leith Church today and is viewable when the church is open.

The old Leith Church closed in 1969, as did the old Leith Golf Course in the 1970s. The Leith congregation now worships at the United Church just up the hill in Annan. The Leith church building fell into disrepair for a number of years. However, since 1992 the church and nearby cemetery have been declared a designated heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act. The church has been refurbished and is now maintained by a vigorous, energetic and strong community of volunteers known as the &quot;Friends of Leith Church&quot; [FOLC]. The church is occasionally opened for special events and regular fundraising continues to maintain the building. Due to the excellent acoustics, the church building is regularly used for musical concerts during the spring, summer and fall period (Leith Summer Festival). It has a seating capacity of 180 and is particularly renowned for chamber music ensembles.

<text>Aragua State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. It is located in the north-central region of Venezuela. It has plains and jungles and Caribbean beaches. The most popular are Cata and Choroni. It has Venezuela&#x27;s first national park, Henri Pittier National Park. The capital is Maracay, other important cities include Turmero and El Limón.

Aragua State covers a total surface area of and, based on the 2011 census information, the estimated population of Aragua State in 2012 is 1,630,308 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
The name of the state comes from an indigenous word of Cumanagoto (Caribbean) origin, which is used to refer to the Chaguaramo, a type of palm from the region [quotation required] However, according to Carlos Blanco Galeno, a chronicler from Turmero, it derives from the Cariban aregua, and this de are (&#x27;site&#x27;) and gua which in turn derives from ogun (&#x27;my thing&#x27;), so it would mean &#x27;my place, my country&#x27;. This same word inspired the name of the Aragua River, an important tributary of Lake Valencia.

==History==

The land where the city of Maracay is located today was granted to Sebastián Díaz Alfaro in the 16th century. After his death the land passed to his son Mateo. At that time these lands were known as Valle de Tucupío and Tepatopo and were used as cattle grazing lands. Towards Tucupío, Tapatapa, Guey and El Rincón, sugar cane and cocoa were planted.

By the year 1700 about 40 families inhabited the valley, which went to Bishop Diego de Baños y Sotomayor to choose a parish, which was equivalent to giving consistency to the official population center.

On March 5, the city of Maracay was founded, taking its name from the Maracay River. Maracay suffered the vicissitudes of the emancipatory revolution, being of special interest the events of 1812-13 that took place at the La Trinidad hacienda. Later, in 1816 and 1818, there was the assault of La Cabrera and the battle of Maracay where the patriotic troops were defeated. The Federal War also left its mark on the town, seriously affecting the surrounding countryside. In addition, there was a terrible plague epidemic, apparently caused by the decomposition of fermented indigo, which claimed many victims.

The beginnings of Maracay&#x27;s urban and economic transformation began during the administration of General Juan Vicente Gómez, who resided in the city from the beginning of his government. In 1898, La Victoria was designated as the capital of the state and later, in 1917, it was moved to Maracay, a status it still retains.
===Conquest and Spanish Colonial Era===
Aragua was part of the Province of Caracas from 1555.

European groups later penetrated the area of Aragua than what is now Carabobo or Miranda. It was in the last decade of the 16th century when the Spanish began to implant encomiendas in the Valleys of Aragua. By 1620 all the lands of Aragua were divided among some 40 encomenderos, who lived primarily in the Valley of Caracas.

Maracay was founded in 1701.

By 1780 La Victoria was a town with about 800 Indians who only spoke Spanish and more than 4 thousand people from other groups, including Spaniards, Creoles, mestizos, blacks and Zambos.

Alexander von Humboldt referred to the fact that the population by 1800 in the area of the valleys of Aragua - which at that time included both sides of Lake Valencia - was mostly composed of brown and creole people, apart from zambos and slaves and that there were still approximately 5000 registered Indians, most of whom were concentrated in Turmero and Guacara. None of them spoke their ancestral languages anymore.

===19th century===
Aragua was created as a province on February 11, 1848 when it was separated from that of Caracas, with a territory similar to that which today encompasses the current state of Aragua and composed of La Victoria, Turmero, Maracay, Villa de Cura and San Sebastian, having the city of La Victoria as its capital.

In 1864 Aragua became an independent state until 1866, when it merged with Guárico to form the state of Guzmán Blanco. Its capital changed to Villa de Cura in 1881. Finally in 1899 Aragua recovered its status as an autonomous state
===20th century===
In 1917 its capital was moved from La Victoria to Maracay. The dictator Juan Vicente Gómez stayed most of his time in Maracay and it was there that he died in 1935.

Its definitive limits were established by protocols signed with the bordering states at different times: in 1909 (Miranda), 1917 (Carabobo) and 1933 (Guárico).

In 1989 he elected his first governor under direct universal and secret elections which ended the practice of having a government designated from the central government in Caracas.

==Geography==
Aragua borders the Caribbean Sea to the north, with its coastline backed by the fast-rising central Cordillera mountain range. Codazzi Peak reaches over 2400 m above sea level. Much of the rest of the state is made up of fertile valleys used for intensive agriculture, apart from in the extreme south where the flats of the central Llanos region begin. On the western border is Lake Valencia.

The main rivers in the state are the Aragua, the Guárico, the El Limón, the Tuy, the Pao and the Turmero. They flow into the Caribbean Sea, Lake Valencia, or feed the vast Orinoco River network. The Camatagua reservoir is one of the main reservoirs supplying Caracas.

===Geology===

Four natural regions can be distinguished in the entity: the coastal mountain range, the depression of Lake Valencia, the inland mountain range, and the Central Wavy Plains. In the depression of Lake Valencia, recent sedimentary formations predominate, while the mountainous areas present others that are highly affected by metamorphic processes, although in the presence of nuclei with more conserved igneous and sedimentary rocks. In the mountain ranges of the Interior chain, galleys can be observed, as spurs of that mountain range, which smoothen their forms towards the South until they enter the formation of the plains.

===Area===

The region has an area of 7,014 km², most of which is mountainous, and represents 0.76% of the Venezuelan territory. The maritime coast of the state extends from Turiamo Bay in the west to Puerto Maya in the east, corresponding to the central section of the Coastal Range. The southern zone of the state runs from the southern piedmont lands of the Caribbean mountain range, through the curve of the 100 meter level that separates the Llanos Altos from the Llanos Bajos to the depression of the Unare River and the San Carlos River that separates it from the Llanos Altos Occidentales.

===Relief===

One of the largest reliefs in the world crosses the state of Aragua, in an east-west direction, two parallel mountain ranges, separated from each other by a central depression, which determines the existence of three well-differentiated physiographic regions, which follow each other from north to south. The northern end is hilly with the central stretch of the Litoral mountain range that culminates with El Cenizo peak at 2,436 meters above sea level and Codazzi peak at 2,426 meters above sea level.

===Hydrography===

The hydrographic network of the state is part of three major points: the tip of the Caribbean Sea, formed by the rivers; San Miguel, Ocumare, Cata, Gaurapito, Aroa and through the river Tuy, the rivers of its upper basin: the Orinoco river basin, formed by the high point and part of the middle point of the Guárico river and the middle part of the Memo river and finally, the endorheic point of the Valencia lake where the Aragua, Turmero, Maracay, Caño Grande, Tapatapa, Tocorón and Las Minas rivers pour their waters. In the latter, the surface courses have been considerably reduced, as it is no longer possible to use the water from these rivers for human consumption. These rivers have now become the main collectors of wastewater discharges, both for urban industrial and agricultural use.

===Climate===

Due to its diversity in relief and altitudes that it possesses in all its extension, there are different thermal floors in which the temperature tends to have different climatic characteristics and temperatures that decrease with the increase of the altitude, in the coastal strip dominates a semi-arid and warm climate, as it is evidenced in Turiamo and Puerto Maya, Although orographic rainfall occurs at elevations on the northern flank of the Serranía de Litoral, allowing for cooler and more humid conditions, which make possible the formation of cloud forests in the Henri Pittier National Park, local conditions allow for greater humidity and warmer temperatures in some coastal coves, such as Chuao, Choroní and Ocumare, which are used in traditional cocoa plantations.

At the altitudes of the Coastal Range, an isothermal climate is expressed, reaching in Colonia Tovar, at 1,900 meters above sea level, an average annual temperature of only 15.4 °C and rainfall of 1,000 mm per year. In the depression of Lake Valencia and the valleys of Aragua, warmer conditions are recognized. In Maracay, at 545 meters above sea level, an average annual temperature of 25 °C and annual rainfall of 834 mm are recorded, with a well-defined dry season. In the plain sector, there is a rainy tropical savanna climate, with an average rainfall of 1,100 mm, a rigorous dry season and average annual temperatures of 26 °C.

===Soils===

The lands of the valleys of Aragua are rich in minerals, as well as fertile; even the mountainous areas are suitable for certain types of crops. There you can find soils with a medium accumulation of organic matter and clay. The banks of the lake show a formation of calcium content due to the presence of fossils. Due to these characteristics, the soil of the state of Aragua is one of the most fertile in the country.

===Vegetation===
Vegetation ranges from abundant foliage trees, present in the cloud forests of the Henri Pittier National Park, on the Litoral mountain range, to thorny scrub in the coastal area. In the areas of valleys and savannahs, grasses predominate, accompanied by trees such as kapok, cedar and saman.

==Politics and government==

As a federal state, it is autonomous and equal in political terms to the other members of the Federation, it organizes its administration and public powers through the Constitution of Aragua State, which was adopted in 2002. The same establishes the division of powers into executive and legislative. This Constitution can only be reformed totally or partially by the legislative power of Aragua, and to be approved, they need the absolute majority of the state deputies.
===Executive branch===
It is composed of the governor of Aragua and a group of state secretaries who are appointed by him. The governor is elected by the people by direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of immediate re-election for an equal period, being in charge of the state administration.

Since direct elections for Venezuela state governors in 1989, Aragua has been governed by the Movement for Socialism and PODEMOS (1989 - 2008). The current governor is Daniela González of the PSUV.


Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

===Legislative power===
The State Legislature is the responsibility of the Legislative Council of the unicameral Aragua State, elected by the people through direct and secret vote every four years, being able to be reelected for new consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the state and its municipalities, the State has 9 main deputies and their substitutes, of which 8 belong to the opposition and 1 to the officialism according to the elections held in December 2015.

== Demographics ==

Aragua State, with 8.28% of the country&#x27;s total population, is the sixth most populated state in Venezuela. The total population of the state was 2,093,224 inhabitants in 2015.
The population is located on the coast and in the lower valleys. The valleys of Aragua are one of the most populated regions of Venezuela, due to the rapid process of industrialization of the city of Maracay and its important metropolitan area of more than 2.1 million inhabitants, of which a little more than 230,000 inhabitants, are part of its area of influence spread between the states of Carabobo and Guárico.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

The population in the region is very diverse, due to the influence of immigration that existed from the 1950s until the present day. Most of its population is a product of the mixing between Spaniards and local natives or Spaniards and Africans. In the northern part of the state, where the highest population density and the largest urban area in the state are found, the majority of whites are present, especially in the municipalities: Tovar, Mario Briceño Iragorry and Girardot.

The Municipality of Tovar, in the north of the state, is populated almost entirely by white people of German descent, since this was the site of the Tovar Colony, a town founded by Germans who immigrated to Venezuela in the nineteenth century.

<doc id="287990" wikidata="Q315698" url="?curid=287990" title="Urukagina">
<text>Uru-ka-gina, Uru-inim-gina, or Iri-ka-gina ( ; died 2370 BC) was King of the city-states of Lagash and Girsu in Mesopotamia, and the last ruler of the 1st Dynasty of Lagash. He assumed the title of king, claiming to have been divinely appointed, upon the downfall of his corrupt predecessor, Lugalanda.

He is best known for his reforms to combat corruption, which are sometimes cited as the first example of a legal code in recorded history. Although the actual text has not been discovered, much of its content may be surmised from other references to it that have been found. In it, he exempted widows and orphans from taxes; compelled the city to pay funeral expenses (including the ritual food and drink libations for the journey of the dead into the lower world); and decreed that the rich must use silver when purchasing from the poor, and if the poor does not wish to sell, the powerful man (the rich man or the priest) cannot force him to do so.

He also participated in several conflicts, notably a losing border conflict with Uruk. In the seventh year of his reign, Uruk fell under the leadership of Lugal-zage-si, &quot;énsi&quot; of Umma, who ultimately annexed most of the territory of Lagash and established the first reliably documented kingdom to encompass all of Sumer. The destruction of Lagash was described in a lament (possibly the earliest recorded example of what would become a prolific Sumerian literary genre), which stressed that &quot;the men of Umma ... committed a sin against Ningirsu. ... Offence there was none in Urukagina, king of Girsu, but as for Lugal-Zage-Si, governor of Umma, may his goddess Nisaba make him carry his sin upon his neck&quot;. Lugal-Zage-Si himself was soon defeated and his kingdom was annexed by Sargon of Akkad.

==Reforms==
Urukagina&#x27;s code has been widely hailed as the first recorded example of government reform, seeking to achieve a higher level of freedom and equality. It limited the power of the priesthood and large property owners, and took measures against usury, burdensome controls, hunger, theft, murder, and seizure (of people&#x27;s property and persons); as he states, &quot;The widow and the orphan were no longer at the mercy of the powerful man&quot;. Here, the word &quot;freedom&quot; (&quot;ama-gi&quot;), appears for the first time in recorded history.

Despite these apparent attempts to curb the excesses of the elite class, it seems elite or royal women enjoyed even greater influence and prestige in his reign than previously. Urukagina greatly expanded the royal &quot;Household of Women&quot; from about 50 persons to about 1,500 persons, renamed it the &quot;Household of goddess Bau&quot;, gave it ownership of vast amounts of land confiscated from the former priesthood, and placed it under the supervision of his wife, Shasha (or Shagshag). In his second year of reign, Shasha presided over the lavish funeral of his predecessor&#x27;s queen, Baranamtarra, who had been an important personage in her own right.

In addition to such changes, two of his other surviving decrees, first published and translated by Samuel Kramer in 1964, have attracted controversy in recent decades. First, he seems to have abolished the former custom of polyandry in his country, on pain of the woman taking multiple husbands being stoned with rocks upon which her crime is written. Second is a statute stating that &quot;if a woman says [text illegible...] to a man, her mouth is crushed with burnt bricks.&quot; No comparable laws from Urukagina addressing penalties for adultery by men have survived. The discovery of these fragments has led some modern critics to assert that they provide &quot;the first written evidence of the degradation of women&quot;.

===Excerpt of some regulations from the Reform document===
* From the border territory of Ningirsu to the sea, no person shall serve as officers.
* For a corpse being brought to the grave, his beer shall be 3 jugs and his bread 80 loaves. One bed and one lead goat shall the undertaker take away, and 3 &quot;ban&quot; [about 18 liters] of barley shall the person(s) take away. 
* When to the reeds of Enki a person has been brought, his beer will be 4 jugs, and his bread 420 loaves. One &quot;barig&quot; [about 36 liters] of barley shall the undertaker take away, and 3 &quot;ban&quot; [about 18 L] of barley shall the persons of ... take away. One woman&#x27;s headband, and one &quot;sila&quot; [about 1 L] of princely fragrance shall the &quot;eresh-dingir&quot; priestess take away. 420 loaves of bread that have sat are the bread duty, 40 loaves of hot bread are for eating, and 10 loaves of hot bread are the bread of the table. 5 loaves of bread are for the persons of the levy, 2 mud vessels and 1 &quot;sadug&quot; vessel of beer are for the lamentation singers of Girsu. 490 loaves of bread, 2 mud vessels and 1 &quot;sadug&quot; vessel of beer are for the lamentation singers of Lagash. 406 loaves of bread, 2 mud vessels, and 1 &quot;sadug&quot; vessel of beer are for the other lamentation singers. 250 loaves of bread and one mud vessel of beer are for the old wailing women. 180 loaves of bread and 1 mud vessel of beer are for the men of Nigin. 
* The blind one who stands in ..., his bread for eating is one loaf, 5 loaves of bread are his at midnight, one loaf is his bread at midday, and 6 loaves are his bread in the evening.
* 60 loaves of bread, 1 mud vessel of beer, and 3 &quot;ban&quot; of barley are for the person who is to perform as the &quot;sagbur&quot; priest, king, or god.

==Praise poem of Urukagina==

Some insight into Sumerian values can be gained from praise poems written for kings. While the kings may not always live up to this praise they show the type of achievements that they wished to be remembered by. Extracts below praise Urukagina who appears as a social reformer, getting rid of gross abuses of power that had taken hold in Lagash.

# Since time immemorial, since life began, in those days, the head boatman appropriated boats, the livestock official appropriated asses, the livestock official appropriated sheep, and the fisheries inspector appropriated... The shepherds of wool sheep paid a duty in silver on account of white sheep, and the surveyor, chief lamentation-singer, supervisor, brewer and foremen paid a duty in silver on account of young lambs. . . These were the conventions of former times!
# When Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, granted the kingship of Lagash to Urukagina, selecting him from among the myriad people, he replaced the customs of former times, carrying out the command that Ningirsu, his master, had given him.
# He removed the head boatman from control over the boats, he removed the livestock official from control over asses and sheep, he removed the fisheries inspector from control...
# He removed the silo supervisor from control over the grain taxes of the &quot;guda&quot;-priests, he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the paying of duties in silver on account of white sheep and young lambs, and he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the delivery of duties by the temple administrators to the palace.
# The... administrators no longer plunder the orchards of the poor. When a high quality ass is born to a &quot;shublugal&quot;, and his foreman says to him, &quot;I want to buy it from you&quot;; whether he lets him buy it from him and says to him &quot;Pay me the price I want!,&quot; or whether he does not let him buy it from him, the foreman must not strike at him in anger.
# When the house of an aristocrat adjoins the house of a &quot;shublugal&quot;, and the aristocrat says to him, &quot;I want to buy it from you&quot;; whether he lets him buy it from him, having said to him, &quot;Pay me the price I want! My house is a large container—fill it with barley for me!,&quot; or whether he does not let him buy it from him, that aristocrat must not strike at him in anger.
# He cleared and cancelled obligations for those indentured families, citizens of Lagash living as debtors because of grain taxes, barley payments, theft or murder.
# Urukagina solemnly promised Ningirsu that he would never subjugate the waif and the widow to the powerful.

==Lament about the fall of Lagash to Umma==
Urukagina participated in several conflicts, notably a losing border conflict with Uruk. In the seventh year of his reign, Uruk fell under the leadership of Lugal-Zage-Si, &quot;énsi&quot; of Umma, who ultimately annexed most of the territory of Lagash and established the first reliably documented kingdom to encompass all of Sumer. The destruction of Lagash was described in a lament (possibly the earliest recorded example of what would become a prolific Sumerian literary genre), which stressed that:

Lugal-Zage-Si himself was soon defeated and his kingdom was annexed by Sargon of Akkad.

<doc id="287991" wikidata="Q77132" url="?curid=287991" title="Albert Bierstadt">
<text>Albert Bierstadt (January 7, 1830 – February 18, 1902) was a German American painter best known for his lavish, sweeping landscapes of the American West. He joined several journeys of the Westward Expansion to paint the scenes. He was not the first artist to record the sites, but he was the foremost painter of them for the remainder of the 19th century.

Bierstadt was born in Prussia, but his family moved to the United States when he was one year old. He returned to study painting for several years in Düsseldorf. He became part of the second generation of the Hudson River School in New York, an informal group of like-minded painters who started painting along the Hudson River. Their style was based on carefully detailed paintings with romantic, almost glowing lighting, sometimes called &quot;luminism&quot;. Bierstadt was an important interpreter of the western landscape, and he is also grouped with the Rocky Mountain School.

==Early life and education==

Bierstadt was born in Solingen, Rhine Province, Prussia, on January 7, 1830. He was the son of Christina M. (Tillmans) and Henry Bierstadt, a cooper. His older brothers were prominent stereo view photographers Edward Bierstadt and Charles Bierstadt. Albert was just a year old when his family emigrated to New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1831. He made clever crayon sketches in his youth and developed a taste for art.

In 1851, Bierstadt began to paint in oils. He returned to Germany in 1853 and studied painting for several years in Düsseldorf with members of its informal school of painting. After returning to New Bedford in 1857, he taught drawing and painting briefly before devoting himself full-time to painting.

==Career==
In 1858, Bierstadt exhibited a large painting of a Swiss landscape at the National Academy of Design, which gained him positive critical reception and honorary membership in the Academy. Bierstadt began painting scenes in New England and upstate New York, including in the Hudson River Valley. He was part of a group of artists known as the Hudson River School.

In 1859, Bierstadt traveled westward in the company of Frederick W. Lander, a land surveyor for the U.S. government, to see those western American landscapes for his work. He returned to a studio he had taken at the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York with sketches for numerous paintings he then finished. In 1860, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Design; he received medals in Austria, Bavaria, Belgium, and Germany.

In 1863, Bierstadt traveled west again, this time in the company of the author Fitz Hugh Ludlow, whose wife he later married. The pair spent seven weeks in the Yosemite Valley. Throughout the 1860s, Bierstadt used studies from this trip as the source for large-scale paintings for exhibition and he continued to visit the American West throughout his career. The immense canvases he produced after his trips with Lander and Ludlow established him as the preeminent painter of the western American landscape. Bierstadt&#x27;s technical proficiency, earned through his study of European landscape, was crucial to his success as a painter of the American West and accounted for his popularity in disseminating views of the Rocky Mountains to those who had not seen them.

During the American Civil War (1861 to 1865), Bierstadt was drafted in 1863 and paid for a substitute to serve in his place. By 1862, he had completed one Civil War painting &quot;Guerrilla Warfare, Civil War&quot; based on his brief experiences with soldiers stationed at Camp Cameron in 1861. That painting was based on a stereoscopic photograph taken by his brother Edward Bierstadt, who operated a photography studio at Langley&#x27;s Tavern in Virginia. The painting received a positive review when it was exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in December 1861. Curator Eleanor Jones Harvey observed that the painting, created from photographs, &quot;is quintessentially that of a voyeur, privy to the stories and unblemished by the violence and brutality of first-hand combat experience.&quot;

Financial recognition confirmed his status: &quot;The Rocky Mountains, Lander&#x27;s Peak&quot;, completed in 1863, was purchased for $25,000 in 1865, the equivalent of almost $400,000 in 2020.

In 1867, Bierstadt returned to Europe, arriving in London where he exhibited two landscape paintings in a private reception with Queen Victoria. He then travelled through Europe for the next two years, painting new works while also cultivating social and business contacts to sustain the market for his art on the continent. For example, he painted &quot;Among the Sierra Nevada, California&quot; in his Rome studio, displaying it in Berlin and London before having it shipped to the U.S. His exhibition pieces both impressed European audiences and furthered the idea of the American West as a land of promise during a period when European emigration to the U.S. was increasing. Bierstadt&#x27;s choice of grandiose subjects was matched by his entrepreneurial flair. His exhibitions of individual works were accompanied by promotion, ticket sales, and, in the words of one critic, a &quot;vast machinery of advertisement and puffery.&quot;

Bierstadt&#x27;s popularity in the U.S. remained strong during his European tour. The publicity generated by his Yosemite Valley paintings in 1868 led a number of explorers to request his presence as part of their westward expeditions. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad also commissioned him to visit and paint the Grand Canyon and surrounding region.

Despite his popular success, Bierstadt was criticized by some contemporaries for the romanticism evident in his choice of subjects and for his use of light, which they found excessive. Some critics objected to Bierstadt&#x27;s paintings of Native Americans based on their belief that including Indigenous Americans &quot;marred&quot; the &quot;impression of solitary grandeur.&quot;

His wife, Rosalie, was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1876, and Bierstadt spent increasing amounts of time with her in the warmer climate of Nassau in the Bahamas until her death in 1893. He also maintained travel between the western United States, Canada, and his studio in New York.

Though his painting career continued later into his life, Bierstadt&#x27;s work fell increasingly out of critical favor and was increasingly attacked for its theatrical tone. In 1882, a fire destroyed Bierstadt&#x27;s studio at Irvington, New York, and, with it, many of his paintings.

Bierstadt was a prolific artist, having completed over 500 paintings during his lifetime. Yet by the time of his death on February 18, 1902, the taste for epic landscape painting had long since subsided. Bierstadt was buried at the Rural Cemetery in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and remained largely forgotten for nearly 60 years.

==Posthumous reception==
Interest in Bierstadt&#x27;s work was renewed in the 1960s with the exhibition of his small oil studies. Modern opinions of Bierstadt have been divided. Some critics have regarded his work as gaudy, oversized, extravagant champions of Manifest Destiny. Others have noted that his landscapes helped create support for the conservation movement and the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. His work has been placed in a favorable context, as stated in 1987:

On the other hand, his work has also been criticized as largely an imaginary depiction of nature, and even &quot;soulless&quot; in its execution.

==Legacy and honors==
* Because of Bierstadt&#x27;s interest in mountain landscapes, Mount Bierstadt and Bierstadt Lake in Colorado are named in his honor. Bierstadt was probably the first European to visit the summit of Mount Blue Sky in 1863, 1.5 miles from Mount Bierstadt. Bierstadt named it Mount Rosa, a reference to both Monte Rosa above Zermatt and, Rosalie Ludlow, his future wife, but the name was changed from Rosalie to Evans in 1895 in honor of Colorado governor John Evans, and again in 2023 to Blue Sky.
* In 1998, the United States Postal Service issued a set of 20 commemorative stamps entitled &quot;Four Centuries of American Art&quot;, one of which featured Albert Bierstadt&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Buffalo&quot;. In 2008, the USPS issued a commemorative stamp in its &quot;American Treasures&quot; series featuring Bierstadt&#x27;s 1864 painting &quot;Valley of the Yosemite.&quot;
* William Bliss Baker, another landscape artist, studied under Bierstadt.
* The 2018 novel, The Overstory, by Richard Powers features Bierstadt’s painting “Cathedral Forest” as the cover art, further designed by Evan Gaffney. The book won the 2018 AIGA 50 Covers award. The author also won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the book.

<text>Pierre Auguste Cot (; 17 February 1837 – 2 August 1883) was a French painter of the Academic Classicism school.

==Life and career==

Cot was born in Bédarieux, Hérault, and initially studied at l&#x27;Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse before going to Paris. He studied under Leon Cogniet, Alexandre Cabanel and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. In 1863 he made a successful debut at the Salon, and from the 1870s, his popularity grew quickly.

Cot enjoyed the patronage of the academic sculptor Francisque Duret, whose daughter he married, and of Bouguereau, with whom he had also worked. Bouguereau painted a portrait of Cot&#x27;s daughter, Gabrielle. Bouguereau had dined with the Cot family to celebrate Gabrielle&#x27;s marriage to an architect named Zilin. The artist made a gift of the painting to the wife of Duret, Gabrielle&#x27;s grandmother.

Cot won various prizes and medals, and in 1874 was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.

He died in Paris at the age of 46. He is buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Works==
He created several works of lasting popularity, including &quot;Springtime,&quot; featuring two young lovers sitting upon a swing, and &quot;The Storm.&quot; Both these paintings are on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; &quot;The Storm&quot; belongs to the museum while &quot;Le Printemps&quot; is owned privately.

Cot also was renowned for his portraits, which made up the majority of his work. The more enduring figurative work, such as &quot;The Storm,&quot; is comparatively rare. Shortly after his death at the age of forty-six (2 August 1883), a subscription was undertaken for a commemorative monument to the artist, which was erected at Bédarieux in 1892.

<text>Kanon is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key, a brand of Visual Arts. It was released on June 4, 1999, for Windows as an adult game. Key later released versions of &quot;Kanon&quot; without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo Switch. The story follows the life of Yuichi Aizawa, a high school student who returns to a city he last visited seven years prior, and he has little recollection of the events from back then. He meets several girls and slowly regains his lost memories. The gameplay in &quot;Kanon&quot; follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game once ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. &quot;Kanon&quot; has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.

Following the game&#x27;s release, &quot;Kanon&quot; made several transitions into other media. Two manga series were serialized in &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; and &quot;Dragon Age Pure&quot;. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several music albums. Toei Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an original video animation (OVA) episode in 2003. Kyoto Animation produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by ADV Films in 2008, but the license was given to Funimation after ADV&#x27;s closure. The 2006 anime plays on the association between &quot;Kanon&quot; and the musical term canon by using Pachelbel&#x27;s &quot;Kanon D-dur&quot;, or &quot;Canon in D major&quot;, as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Kanon&quot; is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story&#x27;s narrative and dialogue. &quot;Kanon&quot; follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai&#x27;s scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri&#x27;s back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for &quot;Kanon&quot;, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of &quot;Kanon&quot;&#x27;s influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on &quot;Kanon&quot; who thought that.

In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of &quot;Kanon&quot; without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene in each of the five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Yūichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in &quot;Kanon&quot; are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind.

==Plot==
===Setting and themes===
There are several important locations featured in the &quot;Kanon&quot; story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key&#x27;s works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically over the course of the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a layer of snow. The shopping district is featured throughout the story when the characters go into town, and especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori&#x27;s and Mai&#x27;s stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters.

There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the episode titles from the 2006–2007 anime have parts in their titles related to music, such as overture and introit. Miracles play a large part in the story; &quot;Kanon&quot;″s plot line and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur. The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story. Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with four of them when he used to visit the city as a kid.

One of the motifs in the story is amnesia, or memory loss; three of the main characters—Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto—suffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this is used as a plot device to advance the story. Another motif deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. &quot;Newtype USA&quot; stated in an article on &quot;Kanon&quot; that &quot;it&#x27;s when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive&quot;, despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series. These five foods of choice are: taiyaki (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), nikuman (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and gyudon (Mai).
===Main characters===
The player controls Yuichi Aizawa, the game&#x27;s protagonist and a cynical 17-year-old high school student. He is known to play jokes on the girls his age he knows and interacts with throughout the story. Despite this, Yuichi is very loyal and will go to great lengths to please others, even at the expense of his own time and money. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them. Ayu Tsukimiya, the game&#x27;s main heroine, is a short, strange, and mysterious girl immediately recognizable by her winged backpack, red hair band, and tendency to refer to herself with the masculine first-person pronoun . She has a fondness for eating taiyaki, and is notorious for her catchphrase, , which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, pain, and fear. Yuichi&#x27;s first cousin Nayuki Minase, another of the game&#x27;s heroines, has been in love with him since childhood, and must learn how to deal with her feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall in love with one of the other girls. Nayuki talks noticeably slower than those around her, and has constant trouble waking up in the morning except on a few occasions when she is up before Yuichi, much to his surprise.

Yuichi is accosted a few days after arriving in the city by the third heroine Makoto Sawatari, a young amnesiac girl. Despite this, she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever. Yuichi coincidentally meets Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine of the game is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she &quot;punishes&quot; someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head.

===Story===
&quot;Kanon&quot;″s story revolves around a group of five girls whose lives are connected to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to &quot;Kanon&quot;&#x27;s beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999 when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.

On the day after Yuichi&#x27;s return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around the city. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner, but Yuichi is reluctant to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has lost her memories, though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi&#x27;s plan to hand her over to the police.

Another girl who is connected to Yuichi&#x27;s past is Mai Kawasumi who attends his high school as a third-year. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat demons at night while the school is deserted. Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing that no one will believe that there are demons in the school. Yuichi coincidentally meets a fifth girl named Shiori Misaka who he gets to know along with the other four heroines in the story. She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it. Yuichi starts to talk with her more after noticing her in the school courtyard one day. It turns out that Shiori stands outside on the school grounds nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her.

==Development==
Most of &quot;Kanon&quot;″s development staff originally worked for the visual novel publisher Nexton under the brand Tactics. After the release of the brand&#x27;s third game &quot;&quot;, most of Tactics&#x27; staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game. Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at Visual Arts once before, introduced Key&#x27;s founding members to the president of Visual Arts, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to Visual Arts where they formed Key on July 21, 1998, and started production on &quot;Kanon&quot;. The planning for the visual novel was headed by Naoki Hisaya who was also one of two scenario writers with Jun Maeda. Hisaya wrote the scenarios for Ayu, Nayuki and Shiori, while Maeda wrote the routes for Makoto and Mai. Art direction was headed by Key&#x27;s artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design and computer graphics. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Dinn, Miracle Mikipon, Shinory—and background art was provided by Torino. The music in the game was composed by OdiakeS, Shinji Orito and Jun Maeda. &quot;Kanon&quot; was the first and last visual novel developed by Key that two of the main staff—Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS—worked on before pursuing a similar line of work in other visual novel studios.

==Adaptations==


===Light novels===
Five adult light novels written by Mariko Shimizu and published by Paradigm were released in Japan between October 1999 and August 2000. The cover art and internal illustrations were drawn by Itaru Hinoue, the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first two released were and in December 1999. The third was released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was titled &quot;The Fox and the Grapes&quot; (Makoto), released two months later. The final novel titled was released in August 2000. Paradigm re-released the five novels in conjunction with Visual Arts under their VA Bunko imprint, which removed the erotic scenes, starting with &quot;Yuki no Shōjo&quot; on June 27, 2009, and ending with &quot;Hidamari no Machi&quot; on December 26, 2009. To make up for the missing erotic content, Shimizu wrote additional content for each volume. A sixth novel titled for the supporting character Sayuri Kurata written by Shimizu and illustrated by Zen was released on March 31, 2011.

===Trading card game===
Following the release of the original visual novel, Key collaborated with TI Tokyo to release the Kanon Trading Card Game. The game was showcased through Comiket, with the original beta cards and promotional materials appearing in winter 1999. This release would also be expanded to include the Air Trading Card Game, based on Key&#x27;s followup visual novel, &quot;Air&quot;, alongside several expansions to the core game.

===Drama CDs and radio shows===
A set of five drama CDs were released between September 29, 2000, and April 27, 2001, with each volume focusing on a different heroine. A set of five anthology drama CDs were released between December 22, 2001, and May 25, 2002, with each volume again focusing on a different heroine. A radio show to promote the Dreamcast port of &quot;Kanon&quot; titled broadcast 13 episodes between October 6 and December 29, 2000. The show, produced by Movic, was hosted by Yukari Tamura and Tomoko Kawakami, the voices Mai Kawasumi and Sayuri Kurata, respectively. A radio drama titled broadcast 53 episodes between October 6, 2001, and October 5, 2002. The show, which was broadcast on TBS Radio and Radio Kansai, was hosted by Yūko Minaguchi, the voice of Akiko Minase, and narrated by Atsushi Kisaichi. The voice actors from &quot;Kanon&quot; were also featured as guests. Five CD compilation volumes containing all of the show&#x27;s broadcasts were released between August 30, 2002, and April 26, 2003.

===Manga===
The first &quot;Kanon&quot; manga illustrated by Petit Morishima was serialized in MediaWorks&#x27; manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes published by MediaWorks under their &quot;Dengeki Comics&quot; imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002. There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the prologue in volume one and the epilogue in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in. The first manga is different from the visual novel in that Shiori&#x27;s, Makoto&#x27;s, and Mai&#x27;s stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls&#x27; stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls&#x27; stories prematurely. This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu&#x27;s story.

The second manga illustrated by Kinusa Shimotsuki, under the main title with the subtitle &quot;each regret of Kanon&quot;, was serialized between volumes two and seven of Fujimi Shobo&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Age Pure&quot; magazine sold between June 29, 2006, and October 20, 2007, respectively. The first volume was released in Japan on April 1, 2007, and focused on Nayuki&#x27;s story. The second volume was released on December 8, 2007, and focused on the other four heroines. There are nine chapters in total, five in volume one and four in volume two.

There have also been many releases of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ichijinsha under the title &quot;Kanon Comic Anthology&quot;, was released in November 2000 under their &quot;DNA Media Comics&quot; label. Volumes for this series continued to be released for another two years, ending in December 2002 with the 14th volume; an additional 15th volume was released later in February 2007. Ichijinsha also released two more volumes of anthology collections of four-panel comic strips titled &quot;Kanon 4-koma Kings&quot; in April and June 2001. Softgarage released an anthology in a single volume in December 2002 titled &quot;Kanon Anthology Comic&quot;. In April 2004, Ohzora released an anthology composed of works based on both &quot;Kanon&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; titled &quot;Haru Urara: Kanon &amp; Air&quot;.

Between June and August 2004, Ohzora also released five separate volumes of manga based on &quot;Kanon&quot; drawn by five separate artists. Ohzora later collected some of the previously published manga anthologies into two volumes titled &quot;Kanon Anthology Comics Best Selection&quot; released in December 2006 and January 2007. Additionally, Ohzora released another 13 volumes of an anthology series titled &quot;Kanon&quot; under their &quot;Twin Heart Comics&quot; label. The now-bankrupt publisher Raporto also released 21 manga anthology volumes titled &quot;Kanon&quot; under their &quot;Raporto Comics&quot; label between November 2000 and October 2002. The last manga anthology, a collection of four-panel comic strips released in a single volume by Enterbrain titled &quot;Magi-Cu 4-koma Kanon&quot;, was released in January 2007 under their &quot;MC Comics&quot; label. Each of the anthology series are written and drawn by an average of 20 people per volume.

===Anime===
The first &quot;Kanon&quot; anime was produced by the Japanese animation studio Toei Animation and directed by Naoyuki Itō. Thirteen episodes were produced and aired in Japan on Fuji TV between January 31 and March 28, 2002. The series also later aired on Kansai TV. Later, a single original video animation (OVA) episode titled &quot;Kanon Kazahana&quot; was released in March 2003. The anime series and OVA used the songs &quot;Florescence&quot; and &quot;Flower&quot; for the opening and ending themes, respectively. While it does not appear as the ending theme in the first 12 episodes or in the OVA, the game&#x27;s ending theme &quot;Where the Wind Reaches&quot; is used as the ending theme for the series in episode 13. Additionally, the game&#x27;s opening theme &quot;Last regrets&quot; is played near the end of episode 13 during the flashback scene.

Starting in 2006, Kyoto Animation, the animators of another Key game-turned-anime, &quot;Air&quot;, decided to animate a new adaptation of &quot;Kanon&quot;. This version, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara and written by Fumihiko Shimo, aired between October 5, 2006, and March 15, 2007, on BS-i, containing 24 episodes. The series was later rebroadcast on TBS. ADV Films announced on September 21, 2007, at the Anime Weekend Atlanta anime convention that they have officially licensed the second &quot;Kanon&quot; anime series. ADV had previously posted a trailer for the series in August 2007, but was soon taken offline once the news had been spread on the Internet. The first English-dubbed episode was made available via streaming online at Anime News Network between December 23 and December 30, 2007. In July 2008, the licensing rights of the second &quot;Kanon&quot; anime were transferred from ADV to Funimation Entertainment (now known as Crunchyroll as of 2025) who continued to produce the series in North America. MVM Entertainment released &quot;Kanon&quot; on DVD in the United Kingdom on April 14, 2022.

The second TV &quot;Kanon&quot; animation features updated animation quality, and uses the same voice acting cast as the first anime, with the exception of Yuichi and Kuze. Unlike the first anime, the actual theme songs from the &quot;Kanon&quot; game are used for the second anime&#x27;s opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode 16 that did not come from the visual novel titled &quot;Last regrets (X&#x27;mas floor style)&quot; by Eiko Shimamiya from I&#x27;ve Sound&#x27;s first album &quot;Regret&quot;. Other songs are used from the arrange albums released over the years, which include &quot;Anemoscope&quot;, &quot;Recollections&quot;, &quot;Re-feel&quot;, and &quot;Ma-Na&quot;.

==Music==

The visual novel has two main theme songs, the opening theme &quot;Last regrets&quot;, and the ending theme , both sung by Ayana. The lyrics for both songs were written by Jun Maeda, and arranged by Kazuya Takase of I&#x27;ve Sound. The five heroines have leitmotifs. Ayu&#x27;s theme is ; Nayuki&#x27;s theme is ; Makoto&#x27;s theme is &quot;The Fox and the Grapes&quot;; Shiori&#x27;s theme is ; lastly, Mai&#x27;s theme is .

The first music album released was &quot;Anemoscope&quot; which came bundled with the original release of &quot;Kanon&quot; in June 1999. The next release was a single, &quot;Last regrets/Place of wind which arrives&quot;, which contained the opening and ending themes plus arranged versions of three background music tracks and a male vocal version of the opening theme. A compilation album containing tracks from the two albums was released in December 2001 called &quot;Recollections&quot;. The game&#x27;s original soundtrack was released in October 2002 containing 22 different tracks along with short versions of the two theme songs. A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called &quot;Re-feel&quot; which contained five tracks from &quot;Kanon&quot; and five from &quot;Air&quot;. Excluding the first two albums, each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key&#x27;s record label Key Sounds Label; this is due to the first two albums being released before the label was formed.

The first anime&#x27;s first original soundtrack was released in May 2002, and a second followed in July 2002. The first anime&#x27;s opening theme is &quot;Florescence&quot; and the ending theme is &quot;Flower&quot;, both sung by Miho Fujiwara; the maxi single containing the anime&#x27;s opening and ending themes was released in June 2002. An album containing music box arranged tracks of music from the first anime was released in July 2003 called &quot;Orgel de Kiku Sakuhin Shū&quot;. The albums released for the first anime were produced by Frontier Works and Movic. A single was released in commemoration for the second anime called &quot;Last regrets/Kaze no Tadoritsuku Basho&quot; which contained the game&#x27;s original opening and ending themes in original, short, and remixed versions; the album was produced by Key Sounds Label.

==Reception and legacy==
According to a national ranking of how well &quot;bishōjo&quot; games sold nationally in Japan, the original &quot;Kanon&quot; release for Windows achieved its highest rank at number two in the ranking. Three years later in June 2002, the original release ranked in again at 45, and then again at 46 the following two weeks. The original release also made the ranking after that at number 41 in early July 2002. The &quot;Kanon&quot; Standard Edition premiered at number 16 in the rankings. The &quot;Kanon&quot; Standard Edition remained on the top 50 list for the next two months, achieving the rankings of 47 and 35. The all ages version of the &quot;Kanon&quot; Standard Edition premiered at number 42 on the national ranking, went up to 35 the next month, and did not appear on the rankings after that. The Dreamcast port sold 42,379 units in the first week and was the fourth top selling console game in Japan for that week. &quot;Kanon&quot; has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms, not counting the PSP release.

Five days before the first PS2 release for &quot;Kanon&quot;, a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. &quot;Kanon&quot; was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being &quot;America Ōden Ultra Quiz&quot; from DigiCube and &quot;Marle de Jigsaw&quot; from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of &quot;Kanon&quot;&#x27;s story could be summed up as &quot;the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end,&quot; resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, poll results for the 50 best &quot;bishōjo&quot; games were released. Out of 249 titles, &quot;Kanon&quot; ranked fifth with 71 votes.

Characters from &quot;Kanon&quot; have appeared in several dōjin games not directly based on the &quot;Kanon&quot; series such as the &quot;Eternal Fighter Zero&quot; game by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from &quot;Kanon&quot; or from &quot;&quot;. The dōjin game &quot;Glove on Fight&quot; featured at least two &quot;Kanon&quot; characters: Ayu Tsukimiya and Akiko Minase in a fighting style game along with various other characters taken from other media. The character Ayu Tsukimiya in particular is known to appear in works outside &quot;Kanon&quot;, such as in strip 67 of the webcomic &quot;Megatokyo&quot; where Ayu is shown eating &quot;taiyaki&quot;.

The second &quot;Kanon&quot; anime series was reviewed at Anime News Network where Theron Martin commented how the series is a &quot;formulaic moe haremfest&quot;, and how the moe aspects of the series may make viewers &quot;feel like they&#x27;re drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness&quot;. The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of &quot;Air&quot;, saying &quot;Like &quot;Air&quot;, the first four episodes can be simply summarized as &#x27;male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.&#x27; Unlike &quot;Air&quot;, however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny.&quot; Martin also compares &quot;Kanon&quot; to the anime adaptation of &quot;Shuffle!&quot; which is described as &quot;bombing&quot; where &quot;Kanon&quot; &quot;works&quot;. The reviewer chalks this up to the characters &quot;endear[ing] themselves to the viewer...far better than what &quot;Shuffle!&quot;&#x27;s do.&quot; Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as a defining feature of the series. However, Martin comments how one of the series&#x27; flaws is how it &quot;overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times&quot; causing little to happen with the plot. Yuichi is described as being &quot;too erratic to be fully credible&quot; or easily believable. Despite the series&#x27; drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as &quot;one of the best moe-centric series to date&quot; and lauds Kyoto Animation&#x27;s production values making &quot;Kanon&quot; &quot;one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year&quot;. Martin adds another series comparison, citing &quot;Kanon&quot; as the &quot;polar opposite of &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;&quot;, which deals primarily in its action-oriented content.

<text>Murphy Orlando Shewchuk is a Canadian writer. He is a past National President of the Canadian Authors Association. He currently resides in Merritt, BC.

He grew up in the British Columbia gold-mining town of Pioneer Mines during the late 1950s. He developed a triple interest in outdoor exploration, photography and electronics while still a teenager. After a stint in the Royal Canadian Air Force in eastern Canada, he and his family moved back to B.C. for a job in electronics with writing and photography as major side interests.

In 1971, his work took him to Kamloops, British Columbia, where he began writing a weekly &quot;Outdoor Scene&quot; column for the &quot;Kamloops Sentinel&quot;. From the column, he moved on to features in &quot;BC Outdoors&quot; and other magazines.

Shewchuk has also been managing editor of the 12th and 13th editions of &quot;The Canadian Writer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, published by Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside of Toronto, Ontario.

In addition to a lifelong interest in writing, photography and exploring the mountains of western Canada, Shewchuk has been a workshop speaker at writer&#x27;s conferences across Canada. He has received awards from the Outdoor Writers of Canada, the Northwest Outdoor Writers Association and the Canadian Authors Association.

He is one of the founding members and a current board member of the Nicola Valley Museum and Archives.

<doc id="288008" wikidata="Q236638" url="?curid=288008" title="Sandy Denny">
<text>Alexandra Elene MacLean Denny (6 January 1947 – 21 April 1978) was an English singer-songwriter who was lead singer of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention. She has been described as &quot;the pre-eminent British folk rock singer&quot;.

After briefly working with the Strawbs, Denny joined Fairport Convention in 1968, remaining with them until 1969. She formed the short-lived band Fotheringay in 1970, before focusing on a solo career. Between 1971 and 1977, Denny released four solo albums: &quot;The North Star Grassman and the Ravens&quot;, &quot;Sandy&quot;, &quot;Like an Old Fashioned Waltz&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous&quot;. She also duetted with Robert Plant on &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s album &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; in 1971. Denny died in 1978 at the age of 31 from head injuries sustained as a result of a fall down a flight of stairs.

Music publications &quot;Uncut&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot; have described Denny as Britain&#x27;s finest female singer-songwriter. Her composition &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; has been recorded by Judy Collins, Eva Cassidy, Nina Simone, Mary Black, Kate Wolf, Nanci Griffith, 10,000 Maniacs and Cat Power. Her recorded work has been the subject of numerous reissues, along with a wealth of previously unreleased material which has appeared over the more than 40 years since her death, including a 19-CD box set released in November 2010.

In January 2023, Denny was ranked #164 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s list of the &quot;200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;.

==Childhood==
Denny was born on 6 January 1947 at Nelson Hospital, Kingston Road, Merton Park, London, to Neil and Edna Denny. She studied classical piano as a child.

Her paternal grandfather was from Dundee, and her paternal grandmother was a Scots Gaelic speaker and singer of traditional Gaelic songs. At an early age Denny showed an interest in singing, although her strict parents were reluctant to believe there was a living to be made from it. She attended Coombe Girls&#x27; School in New Malden; after leaving school she began training as a nurse at the Royal Brompton Hospital.

==Early career==
Denny&#x27;s nursing career proved short-lived. In the meantime she had secured a place on a foundation course at Kingston College of Art, which she took up in September 1965, becoming involved with the folk club on campus. Her contemporaries at the college included guitarist and future member of Pentangle, John Renbourn.

After her first public appearance at the Barge in Kingston upon Thames, Denny began working the folk club circuit in the evenings with an American-influenced repertoire, including songs by Tom Paxton, together with traditional folk songs. Denny made the first of many appearances for the BBC at Cecil Sharp House on 2 December 1966 on the &quot;Folk Song Cellar&quot; programme where she accompanied herself on two traditional songs: &quot;Fir a Bhata&quot; and &quot;Green Grow the Laurels&quot;.

Her earliest professional recordings were made a few months later in mid-1967 for the Saga label, featuring traditional songs and covers of folk contemporaries including her boyfriend of this period, the American singer-songwriter Jackson C. Frank. They were released on the albums &quot;Alex Campbell and His Friends&quot; and &quot;Sandy and Johnny&quot; with Johnny Silvo. These songs were collected on the 1970 album &quot;It&#x27;s Sandy Denny&quot; where the tracks from &quot;Sandy and Johnny&quot; had been re-recorded with more accomplished vocals and guitar playing. The complete Saga studio recordings were issued on the 2005 compilation &quot;Where The Time Goes&quot;.

By this time, she had abandoned her studies at art college and was devoting herself full-time to music. While she was performing at The Troubadour folk club, a member of the Strawbs heard her, and in 1967, she was invited to join the band. She recorded one album with them in Denmark, which was released belatedly in 1973, credited to Sandy Denny and the Strawbs: &quot;All Our Own Work&quot;. The album includes an early solo version of her best-known (and widely recorded) composition, &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; A demo of that song found its way into the hands of American singer Judy Collins, who chose to cover it as the title track of an album of her own, released in November 1968, thus giving Denny international exposure as a songwriter before she had become widely known as a singer.

==From Fairport to Fotheringay==
After making the Saga albums with Alex Campbell and Johnny Silvo, Denny looked for a band that would allow her to stretch herself as a vocalist, reach a wider audience, and have the opportunity to display her songwriting. She said, &quot;I wanted to do something more with my voice.&quot; After working briefly with the Strawbs, Denny remained unconvinced that they could provide that opportunity, and so she ended her relationship with the band.

Fairport Convention conducted auditions in May 1968 for a replacement singer following the departure of Judy Dyble after their debut album, and Denny became the obvious choice. According to group member Simon Nicol, her personality and musicianship made her stand out from the other auditionees &quot;like a clean glass in a sink full of dirty dishes&quot;.

Beginning with &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot;, the first of three albums she made with the band in the late 1960s, Denny is credited with encouraging Fairport Convention to explore the traditional British folk repertoire, and is thus regarded as a key figure in the development of British folk rock. She brought with her the traditional repertoire she had refined in the clubs, including &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Life&quot; featured on their second album together &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot;. Framing Denny&#x27;s performance of this song with their own electric improvisations, her bandmates discovered what then proved to be the inspiration for an entire album, the influential &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; (1969).

Denny left Fairport Convention in December 1969 to develop her own songwriting more fully. To this end, she formed her own band, Fotheringay, which included her future husband, Australian Trevor Lucas, formerly of the group Eclection.

They created one self-titled album, which included an eight-minute version of the traditional &quot;Banks of the Nile&quot;, and several Denny originals, among them &quot;The Sea&quot; and &quot;Nothing More&quot;. The latter marked her first composition on the piano, which was to become her primary instrument from then on. Fotheringay started to record a second album in late 1970, but it remained unfinished after Denny announced that she was leaving the group and producer Joe Boyd left to take up a job at Warner Brothers in California. Denny would later blame Boyd&#x27;s hostility towards the group for its demise.

==Solo career and final years==
She then turned to recording her first solo album, &quot;The North Star Grassman and the Ravens&quot;. Released in 1971, it is distinguished by its elusive lyrics and unconventional harmonies. Highlights included &quot;Late November&quot;, inspired by a dream and the death of Fairport band member Martin Lamble, and &quot;Next Time Around&quot; a cryptogram about Jackson C. Frank, one of her many portraits in song.

&quot;Sandy&quot;, with a cover photograph by David Bailey, followed in 1972 and was the first of her albums to be produced by Trevor Lucas. As well as introducing eight new original compositions, the album marked her last recording of a traditional song, &quot;The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood&quot; (words by Richard Fariña), with Denny&#x27;s ambitious multi-tracked vocal arrangement inspired by the Ensemble of the Bulgarian Republic.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; readers twice voted her the &quot;Best British Female Singer&quot;, in 1970 and 1971 and, together with contemporaries including Richard Thompson and Ashley Hutchings, she participated in a one-off project called the Bunch to record a collection of rock and roll era standards released under the title of &quot;Rock On&quot;.

In 1971, Denny duetted with Robert Plant on &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;, which was included on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1971 album (&quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;); she was the only guest vocalist ever to appear on a Led Zeppelin album. In 1972 Denny had a small cameo on Lou Reizner&#x27;s symphonic arrangement of the Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;. In a brief appearance, she sang the character of The Nurse on the track &quot;It&#x27;s a Boy,&quot; which also featured vocals from Pete Townshend.

In 1973, she married long-term boyfriend and producer Trevor Lucas and recorded a third solo album, &quot;Like an Old Fashioned Waltz&quot;. The songs continued to detail many of her personal preoccupations: loss, loneliness, fear of the dark, the passing of time and the changing seasons. The album contained one of her best loved compositions, &quot;Solo&quot;, and featured a cover image by Gered Mankowitz.
In 1974, she returned to Fairport Convention (of which her husband was by then a member) for a world tour (captured on the 1974 album &quot;Fairport Live Convention&quot;) and a studio album, &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot; in 1975. Although her development as a soloist and songwriter had taken her further away from the folk roots direction that the band had pursued since &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;, seven of the eleven tracks on &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot; were either written or co-written by her.

Denny and Lucas left Fairport Convention at the end of 1975 and embarked on what was to become her final album &quot;Rendezvous&quot;. Released in 1977, the album sold poorly and Denny was subsequently dropped by Island Records. Denny gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Georgia, in July 1977 after relocating to the village of Byfield in Northamptonshire.

A UK tour to promote &quot;Rendezvous&quot; in autumn 1977 marked her final public appearances. The closing night at the Royalty Theatre in London on 27 November 1977 was recorded for a live album, &quot;Gold Dust&quot;, which, because of technical problems in the recording of the electric guitar, was belatedly released in 1998 after most of the guitars had been re-recorded by Jerry Donahue.

==Death==
Linda Thompson would later note that Denny &quot;really started going downhill in 1976&quot; and demonstrated increasing levels of both manic and depressive behaviour. Depression, mood swings and the unravelling of her &quot;tumultuous&quot; marriage to Trevor Lucas heightened her drug and alcohol abuse, in the midst of which she learned that she was pregnant. Her daughter, Georgia, was born prematurely in July 1977. Much like her moods, Denny&#x27;s interest towards her daughter appeared to oscillate between obsessive and unconcerned; friends recalled both frantic, middle-of-the-night phone calls about teething, as well as Denny &quot;crashing the car and leaving the baby in the pub and all sorts of stuff&quot;.
Friends would later note that Denny had a history of purposely throwing herself off bar stools and down flights of stairs, presumably as a humorous pratfall in the manner of Peter Sellers’ Inspector Clouseau character. Several remembered this behaviour as &quot;Sandy&#x27;s party trick&quot;, while Dave Pegg&#x27;s wife Chris stated, &quot;She certainly did it in my house and it could be a very dramatic gesture, like self-harming. She could do it without hurting herself usually but I had a feeling there would be one time too many.&quot; Those who knew Denny said that her increasing level of alcohol abuse in the last years of her life led to an increasing number of falls (both accidental and deliberate), resulting in a growing number of injuries.

In late March 1978, while on holiday with her parents and baby Georgia in Cornwall, Denny was injured when she fell down a staircase and hit her head on concrete. Following the incident, she suffered from intense headaches; a doctor prescribed her the painkiller dextropropoxyphene, a drug known to have fatal side effects when mixed with alcohol. On 1 April, several days after the fall in Cornwall, Denny performed a charity concert at Byfield. The final song she performed was &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot;

At some unknown point during the first half of April 1978, Denny suffered yet another major fall at her home in Byfield. On 13 April, concerned about his wife&#x27;s erratic behaviour and fearing for his daughter&#x27;s safety, Trevor Lucas left the UK and returned to his native Australia with their child, leaving Denny without telling her. He sold their Austin Princess car in order to raise funds for the journey.

On discovering Lucas&#x27; departure, Denny went to stay at the home of her friend Miranda Ward. During this time, Denny apparently set up an appointment to speak with a doctor about her headaches, and also intended to get advice about her alcohol addiction. At some point after 8 am on 17 April, Denny fell into a coma. Ward was out of the house at the time, and had asked her friend Jon Cole (of the band the Movies) to check in on Denny. Cole entered the home at 3 pm, and found Denny unconscious at the foot of the staircase which led to the second floor of the house. She was rushed by ambulance to Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital in nearby Roehampton.

On 19 April, she was transferred to Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon. After receiving news that Denny was in a coma, Lucas returned from Australia. Doctors informed him that Denny was effectively brain-dead and her condition would not improve. She died on 21 April 1978 without regaining consciousness. Her death was ruled to be the result of a traumatic mid-brain haemorrhage and blunt force trauma to her head. She was 31 years old.

The funeral took place on 27 April 1978 at Putney Vale Cemetery. After the vicar had read Denny&#x27;s favourite psalm, Psalm 23, a piper played &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;, a traditional song commemorating the fallen of Flodden Field and one which had appeared on the 1970 Fairport album &quot;Full House&quot;. 
The inscription on her headstone reads:

Although Denny had a devoted following in her lifetime, she did not achieve mass market success. In the years since her death, her reputation has grown and there have been a number of releases.

====1985–1987====
A four-album box set entitled &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; (1985) was produced by her widower Trevor Lucas and Joe Boyd and included a number of rare and previously unreleased tracks by Denny, either solo or with Fairport Convention (1968, 1969, 1974) and Fotheringay (1970). This was the first public indication that a large cache of unreleased material existed. A one-disc subset of these recordings was subsequently issued on CD by Island in 1987 entitled &quot;The Best Of Sandy Denny&quot;.

In 1987, a compilation of previously unreleased tracks recorded for the BBC by incarnations of Fairport including Denny was released on LP under the title &quot;Heyday&quot;, which was subsequently released on CD in 2001 and again, with extra tracks, in 2002; all tracks were later included, with others, on the 2007 4-CD box set &quot;Fairport Convention Live at the BBC&quot; . The initial purpose of this compilation was to document the more &quot;American&quot; material performed live by the &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot; lineup of the band that never made it to vinyl, while the re-releases added additional songs as performed by the &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; and &quot;Liege and Lief&quot; lineups.

Also in 1987, a VHS documentary, &quot;It All Comes &#x27;Round Again&quot;, on Fairport Convention was released which contained excerpts of several audio recordings featuring Denny, plus a single poor-quality video recording of her singing her song &quot;Solo&quot; during her second stint with Fairport in 1974, as filmed by the University of Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Guild TV&quot; amateur organisation. The original tape of this recording has apparently been lost; however, &quot;Like an Old Fashioned Waltz&quot; does appear on the DVD documentary &quot;Sandy Denny Under Review&quot; and other tracks have been made available via YouTube in very poor quality.

====1988–1999====
In 1991, Joe Boyd issued a new version of Denny&#x27;s &quot;All Our Own Work&quot; album with the Strawbs, called &quot;Sandy Denny and the Strawbs&quot;, on his Hannibal Records label. The album had strings added to some tracks, including &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; and further tracks with Denny on lead vocal.

Over the period 1988–1994, the Australian &quot;Friends of Fairport&quot; issued a series of subscriber-only cassette compilations drawing in the main on previously unreleased tapes from Trevor Lucas&#x27; collection (as stored in his attic in fact). Attic Tracks (AT) 1 (1988) contained out-takes from Sandy as well as some Fairport material and a few bizarre extras; AT 2 (1989) contained only Trevor Lucas material, no Denny; AT 3 (1989) entitled &quot;First and Last Tracks&quot; comprised 1966–1967 home demos and rare radio tracks, as well as 9 &quot;pre-overdub&quot; songs from Denny&#x27;s last concert at the Royalty Theatre, London, on 27 November 1977 (a partial alternative to the later, overdubbed CD release &quot;Gold Dust&quot;), and AT 4 (1994): &quot;Together Again&quot; comprised one side of Lucas and the other of Denny in the form of more home demos, studio outtakes, and 4 tracks from a 1973 BBC radio concert. A cut-down version of these tracks (18 songs) was subsequently compiled for CD release by the Australian label Raven Records in 1995 called &quot;Sandy Denny, Trevor Lucas and Friends: The Attic Tracks 1972–1984&quot;.

In 1997, a one-disc compilation of Denny&#x27;s solo BBC recordings was released as &quot;The BBC Sessions 1971–1973&quot; on Strange Fruit Records. Due to rights issues it was withdrawn on the day of release, thereby creating a highly collectible disc (up until the release of the comprehensive &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; box set in 2007). This release was followed in 1998 when Denny&#x27;s final performance at the Royalty Theatre, entitled &quot;Gold Dust&quot;, was issued on CD, following a degree of re-recording and overdubbing of selected backing parts to replace reportedly unsatisfactory originals.

In 1999, a single-disc compilation, &quot;Listen Listen – An Introduction to Sandy Denny&quot;, was released on Island Records comprising 17 previously released tracks taken from her four Island solo albums.

====2000–2005====
&quot;No More Sad Refrains: The Anthology&quot; was released by Universal Records in 2000. When first released, this compilation had several rare tracks, including &quot;The Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; from the Liege and Lief sessions, &quot;Learning the Game&quot; and &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot; from the Bunch album &quot;Rock On&quot;, &quot;Here in Silence&quot; and &quot;Man of Iron&quot; from the &quot;Pass of Arms&quot; soundtrack, and a previously unissued demo of &quot;Stranger to Himself&quot;.

In 2002, a previously unreleased, 2-CD live US concert recording by Fairport Convention from 1974 featuring Denny was released on the Burning Airlines label. Entitled &quot;Before The Moon&quot;, it originated from a radio broadcast from Ebbets Field in Denver, Colorado, on 23/24 May 1974. The second disc was a limited release bonus with the original release comprising the second set from the same concert. This recording was re-released in shortened form as a single disc in 2011 on the It&#x27;s About Music label entitled &quot;Fairport Convention with Sandy Denny: Ebbets Field 1974&quot;.

Also in 2002, the American A&amp;M Records issued a budget-price &quot;20th Century Masters&quot; compilation called &quot;The Best of Sandy Denny&quot; with 10 tracks all available on Denny&#x27;s studio albums.

In 2004 a second comprehensive five-CD box set was released on the Fledg&#x27;ling record label called &quot;A Boxful of Treasures&quot; that included many unreleased recordings, in particular a whole disc of acoustic demos, many recorded at her home in Byfield that was highly prized amongst fans and critics alike, who had long asserted that her solo performances showed her work in its best light, revealing the true quality of her vocal style and compositions. Also in 2004, the Spectrum label issued a 16-track compilation of previously released material entitled &quot;The Collection: Chronological Covers &amp; Concert Classics&quot;, including a mix of studio recordings and live excerpts from the &quot;Gold Dust&quot; Royalty concert.

In 2005, remastered versions of all Denny&#x27;s solo albums came out with bonus tracks. Also in 2005, a single CD compilation entitled &quot;Where the Time Goes: Sandy &#x27;67&quot; was released on Castle Music containing all of Saga&#x27;s Denny album tracks (including the alternative recordings on &quot;It&#x27;s Sandy Denny&quot;), together with two self accompanied tracks from Denny&#x27;s recordings with the Strawbs.

====2006–2008====
A DVD documentary entitled &quot;Sandy Denny Under Review&quot; was released on the Sexy Intellectual label in 2006 which contained interviews with her contemporaries plus brief excerpts from her audio recordings, plus some short video clips including two of the poor quality video recordings with Fairport from Birmingham University , two with Fotheringay from German TV&#x27;s &quot;Beat-Club&quot; (further details given below), and three solo excerpts from the only surviving BBC footage on &quot;One In Ten&quot; (details as given in the next paragraph).

A 4-disc box set, &quot;Sandy Denny Live at the BBC&quot;, came out in September 2007 containing (virtually) all of the known solo recordings made by Denny for that UK broadcaster including two complete concerts, one at the Paris Theatre in 1972 and one recorded for &quot;Sounds on Sunday&quot; in 1973, plus a range of other material spanning the years 1966–1973. Disc 3 of this set was a DVD containing surviving TV footage from a 1971 BBC &quot;One in Ten&quot; session comprising solo performances by Denny of &quot;The North Star Grassman and the Ravens&quot;, &quot;Crazy Lady Blues&quot; and &quot;Late November&quot;, along with digitised excerpts from her diaries, rare photos and a discography. A 1-disc subset of this box set entitled &quot;The Best of the BBC Recordings&quot; was subsequently released in 2008.

A companion box set, &quot;Fairport Convention Live at the BBC&quot;, also came out in 2007 and covered equivalent live recordings by Fairport over the period 1968–1974, of which the first two discs (1968–1970) contain examples from Denny&#x27;s time with that group.

In 2008, Jerry Donahue completed the unfinished second &quot;Fotheringay&quot; album begun in the autumn of 1970. It was released to general acclaim as &quot;Fotheringay 2&quot; and contained some notable Denny performances, in particular earlier versions of two Denny compositions, &quot;Late November&quot; and &quot;John the Gun&quot;, and performances of the traditional songs &quot;Gypsy Davey&quot; and &quot;Wild Mountain Thyme&quot;. Also in 2008, Island Remasters issued a double CD entitled &quot;The Music Weaver (Sandy Denny Remembered)&quot; which contained a mix of better known tracks and less well known demos and live recordings, previously released but not in companion with studio sessions. This compilation is also one of the very few to contain the Led Zeppelin track &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot; which features a rare guest appearance by Denny.

====2010–2012====
In 2010, a large 19-CD retrospective box set, simply titled &quot;Sandy Denny&quot;, was released by Universal/Island Records in a limited edition of 3,000. It contained Denny&#x27;s entire catalogue of studio recordings, including her work with the Strawbs, Fairport Convention, Fotheringay and as a solo artist. The compilation also included a large number of outtakes, demos, live recordings, radio sessions and interviews. The box set was released to good reviews, including a 5-star review in &quot;Uncut&quot; and a 4-star review in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In late 2010, Thea Gilmore was commissioned by Denny&#x27;s estate, in conjunction with Island Records, to write melodies to unrecorded lyrics found in Denny&#x27;s papers. The resulting album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Singing&quot;, was released in November 2011 to generally good notices, including 4-star reviews in &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; among others. On 21 April 2012, the single &quot;London&quot; was released as an exclusive Record Store Day 7″ single.

Further recordings were released in 2011, including a German recording of Fotheringay in concert released as &quot;Essen 1970&quot; on the Garden of Delights label. The performance was remastered by original band member Jerry Donahue. This release was followed by &quot;19 Rupert Street&quot;, a home recording of a rehearsal featuring Sandy and Alex Campbell recorded at his flat in August 1967. This release is notable for the fact that Sandy performs a number of tracks that are not available in any other versions, including a cover of &quot;Fairytale Lullaby&quot; by John Martyn. This CD was put out by Sandy&#x27;s former Strawbs bandmate Dave Cousins on his Witchwood label.

Two-disc &quot;Deluxe Editions&quot; of Denny&#x27;s album reissues appeared in 2011 and 2012 with additional tracks; the 2012 Deluxe Edition of &quot;Sandy&quot; included a previously unreleased eight-song solo set from her 1973 U.S. tour recorded at Ebbet&#x27;s Field in Denver, Colorado. A similar two-disc reissue of Fairport Convention&#x27;s &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot; also included, for the first time, the complete 1974 L.A. Troubadour performance of Fairport with Denny back on board, prior to the official announcement of her re-joining the group.

On account of unprecedented demand for, and exhaustion of supply of the limited edition 19-CD set cited above, in October 2012 a limited edition 4-CD version was released entitled &quot;The Notes and The Words: A Collection of Demos and Rarities&quot;, containing &quot;75 songs that represent the cream of the rarities, demos and outtakes from the box set&quot;. Limited to 3,500 copies, this compilation is also now out-of-print.

====2013–2017====
In 2013, Spectrum records issued a single-disc CD entitled &quot;The Lady – The Essential Sandy Denny&quot; that comprised 15 previously issued tracks, generally from Denny&#x27;s well known albums.

2014 saw the release of another Fairport live U.S. radio broadcast from their 1974 tour with Denny, on RockBeat Records, entitled &quot;Live 1974 (My Father&#x27;s Place)&quot;, comprising 11 live tracks, most featuring Denny, recorded at the New York rock club My Father&#x27;s Place.

A four-disc Fotheringay retrospective, &quot;Nothing More: The Collected Fotheringay&quot;, was released on 30 March 2015. This is the most comprehensive compilation of the group&#x27;s recordings, and contains, in addition to all the tracks on &quot;Fotheringay&quot; and &quot;Fotheringay 2&quot; as both final studio versions and demos/alternate takes, the complete live concert set from Rotterdam in 1970 (including several previously unreleased tracks), seven Fotheringay tracks recorded in session for BBC radio (which had previously circulated only as bootlegs), plus a DVD disc containing four performances by Fotheringay recorded for the German &quot;Beat-Club&quot; TV series in 1970, which considerably augment the otherwise sparse known TV footage of Denny in particular.

May 2016 saw the release of a 2-CD compilation, &quot;I&#x27;ve Always Kept A Unicorn – The Acoustic Sandy Denny&quot; which collected together many previously released, but dispersed, acoustic and/or demo versions of songs better known from their album counterparts, as well as three previously unreleased demos (with Linda Thompson, at the time Linda Peters) from 1972&#x27;s &quot;Rock On&quot; sessions by one-off band The Bunch.

A 7-CD box set by Fairport Convention entitled &quot;Come All Ye – The First 10 Years&quot; was released in July 2017 and contains a small number of additional, previously unreleased demos and alternate takes featuring Denny during her first tenure with the band over the period 1968–1969. Tracks not previously available include versions of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Eastern Rain&quot;, an &quot;a capella&quot; version of &quot;Nottamun Town&quot;, alternative takes of &quot;Autopsy&quot; and &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot;, and a rehearsal version of &quot;The Deserter&quot;.

===Unofficial releases and audience tapes===
In addition to the authorised material listed above, a number unofficial/unauthorised compilations exist plus a range of audience recordings of varying quality, none of which would likely see the light of day as commercial issues but are of interest to a sector of Denny&#x27;s audience on either historic or aesthetic grounds, often providing alternative views of songs known otherwise only from their commercially released versions. The first available unauthorised/bootleg CDs available in the 1980s and 1990s comprised principally off-air and other obscure material under such titles as &quot;Borrowed Thyme&quot;, &quot;Poems from Alexandra&quot;, &quot;Dark the Night&quot;, &quot;Wild Mountain Thyme&quot; and &quot;One Last Sad Refrain&quot;; such compilations are now largely superseded by the subsequent availability of most of the off-air material in much better quality as official releases as described above.

Of more enduring interest are audience tapes of shows of which no &quot;official&quot; tapes survive. These include some early shows by Fairport Convention; a performance by Fotheringay at the 1970 Tenth National Jazz and Blues Festival, held at Plumpton Race Track, Streat, East Sussex, England; &quot;solo&quot; shows by Denny (on occasion with a small band including, among others, Richard Thompson) at the 1971 Lincoln Folk Festival and at the Eltham Well Hall Open Theatre in 1972; performances from York University and Guildhall, Newcastle upon Tyne, also in 1972; an early 1972 U.S. performance from The Bitter End in New York; and several sets (Birmingham and Croydon) from her final 1977 tour in addition to the officially released &quot;Gold Dust&quot; album; plus quite a large number of recordings strongly featuring Denny as part of the re-formed Fairport Convention over the period 1974–1975. The majority of these can be fairly easily located via relevant internet searches and, in addition, can be readily downloaded from archival music servers such as Sugarmegs (Sandy Denny concerts listed under &quot;S&quot;: SugarMegs Streaming Server, Fairport and Fotheringay under &quot;F&quot;: SugarMegs Streaming Server).

==Legacy==

===Estate and family===
After relocating to Australia and remarrying, Trevor Lucas died of a heart attack in 1989. Denny&#x27;s estate is now managed by Lucas&#x27; widow, Elizabeth Hurtt-Lucas. A number of otherwise unreleased recordings of Sandy Denny from his collection have subsequently been the basis for posthumous releases of Denny&#x27;s work including those on &quot;The Attic Tracks&quot; and elsewhere.

Sandy Denny&#x27;s daughter, Georgia, has rarely spoken about her mother in a public forum and in the mid-2000s declined an invitation to write the liner notes for &quot;Sandy Denny Live at the BBC&quot;. However, in 2006 she flew to Britain from Australia to accept on her mother&#x27;s behalf the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards award for Most Influential Folk Album of All Time, which was given for Fairport Convention&#x27;s &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;. Georgia gave birth to twin daughters on 29 April 1997, and a tribute album, &quot;Georgia on Our Mind&quot;, featuring many of Sandy Denny&#x27;s former bandmates and friends, was compiled in the children&#x27;s honour. She also administers a Facebook page &quot;Sandy Denny and Family&quot; dedicated to her mother&#x27;s memory and more recently, under the name Georgia Katt, has released some of her own DJ-based music.

===Tributes===
Since her death, many tributes have been made to Denny, both in music and elsewhere. Dave Pegg of Fairport Convention recorded the tribute &quot;Song for Sandy&quot; on his 1983 solo album &quot;The Cocktail Cowboy Goes It Alone&quot;. Dave Cousins of the Strawbs wrote &quot;Ringing Down the Years&quot; in memory of Denny shortly after her death. Songs more specific to the death were Bert Jansch&#x27;s &quot;Where Did My Life Go&quot; (from the album &quot;Thirteen Down&quot;) and Richard Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Did She Jump or Was She Pushed?&quot; (from the album &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot;). Fellow Brit folk pioneers Spriguns changed the title of their 1978 album to &quot;Magic Lady&quot; after hearing of Denny&#x27;s death while recording. In 1998, a variety of Daylily was named after her.

Denny&#x27;s songs have been covered by numerous artists in the years since her death. Some of the notable acts to have covered her music include Yo La Tengo, former Marillion frontman Fish, who covered &quot;Solo&quot; on his album &quot;Songs from the Mirror&quot;, Cat Power, Judy Collins, Nanci Griffith and Nina Simone. Kate Bush mentioned Denny in the lyric of &quot;Blow Away (For Bill)&quot;, as one of the musicians to greet Bill in Heaven and is the third track on Bush&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Never for Ever&quot;. In 1984, Clann Eadair released the single &quot;A tribute to Sandy Denny&quot;, featuring Phil Lynott on vocals.

Several radio specials have been produced about Denny&#x27;s life and music, including BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Sandy Denny Story: Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot;. In 2007, Denny&#x27;s song &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; also received BBC Radio 2&#x27;s 2007 Folk Award for &quot;Favourite Folk Track of All Time&quot;. In 2010, she was recognized by NPR in their &quot;50 Great Voices&quot; special series.

In April 2008, a tribute concert was held at The Troubadour in London, to mark the thirtieth anniversary of Denny&#x27;s death. Those taking part included Martin Carthy, Linda Thompson and Joe Boyd.

A more extensive tribute was given later that year in December at the Southbank in the Queen Elizabeth Hall called &quot;The Lady: A Tribute to Sandy Denny&quot; with a band composed of members of Bellowhead, the evening featured a mix of young folk acts like Jim Moray and Lisa Knapp alongside those that had known and worked with Denny such as Dave Swarbrick and Jerry Donahue. These acts were joined by performers from outside the world of folk like PP Arnold and Marc Almond. The concert, which primarily featured songs written by Denny, received a four-star review in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In May 2012 the Southbank concert was expanded into an eight date UK tour called &quot;The Lady: A Homage to Sandy Denny&quot;. The tour showcased Sandy&#x27;s entire songbook taking in her work with Fairport Convention, Fotheringay, her solo career and the new songs completed by Thea Gilmore on her album &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Singing&quot;.

The band was, once again, composed of members of Bellowhead. Other acts performing included the aforementioned Thea Gilmore and up-and-coming folk acts Lavinia Blackwall of Trembling Bells, Blair Dunlop and Sam Carter, alongside more established folk stars Maddy Prior, Dave Swarbrick and Jerry Donahue. The line-up was completed with performers not normally associated with the folk scene; Green Gartside, Joan Wasser (also known as Joan As Police Woman), and PP Arnold. The tour was well received, obtaining a four-star review in &quot;The Times&quot;. The London concert at the Barbican was filmed for BBC4, and broadcast in a 90-minute programme titled &quot;The Songs of Sandy Denny&quot; in November 2012.

In the 2012 Irish film &quot;Silence&quot; (Harvest Films &amp; South Wind Blows), &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot; is used during the film and final credits.

In April 2016 Denny was inducted into the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Hall of Fame.

Alela Diane recorded the tribute &quot;Song for Sandy&quot; on her album &quot;Cusp&quot;, released in February 2018. The song reflects on Denny&#x27;s final tragic days and her orphaned baby daughter.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Denny at number 164 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>Chung Mong-hun (; September 14, 1948 – August 4, 2003) was the 5th son of Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the South Korean Hyundai conglomerate. After the death of his father, he took over part of his father&#x27;s role and became the chairman of Hyundai Asan, the company in charge of various business ventures between North and South Korea. He committed suicide in 2003.

==Professional career==
Chung Mong-hun joined Hyundai Heavy Industries in 1975, becoming president of the company&#x27;s shipping interests by 1981. His father, Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju-yung, was impressed by his management style and put him in charge of the company&#x27;s electronics division in 1982.

In 1997, Chung Ju-yung appointed Mong-hun as the group&#x27;s co-chairman. In 2000, after Ju-yung&#x27;s eldest son, Mong-koo, attempted to oust Mong-hun, Ju-yung made Mong-hun the group&#x27;s sole chairman. Later that year, Ju-yung announced that he and his sons would resign from all management positions at Hyundai companies, except Mong-hun would remain the chair of Hyundai Asan. However, Mong-koo remained the chairman of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors.

Chung Mong-hun was appointed by his father, who was born in Japan-controlled North Korea, to handle Hyundai business with the government of North Korea. He took pride in this position, and reportedly decorated his office with photographs of Hyundai officials meeting with Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, as well as photos of himself showing Kim around a North Korean resort that Hyundai operated.

==Scandal and suicide==
In June 2003, Chung was indicted for his role in the &quot;cash-for-summit scandal&quot; on charges of doctoring company books to hide the secret money transfers of millions of dollars by the Kim Dae-jung administration to North Korea to set up the 2000 inter-Korean summit. Facing up to three years in prison after he was forced to testify in court about the money transfer days earlier, he committed suicide on August 4, 2003, by leaping from his 12th floor office.

<doc id="288011" wikidata="Q4090508" url="?curid=288011" title="Gordon Bok">
<text>Gordon Bok (born October 31, 1939) is an American folklorist and singer-songwriter, who grew up in Camden, Maine and is associated with music from New England.

==Career==
Bok&#x27;s first album, self-titled, was produced by Noel Paul Stookey (Paul of Peter, Paul, and Mary) and released in 1965 on the Verve Records&#x27; Verve Folkways subsidiary. His second album, &quot;A Tune for November&quot;, was released on Sandy Paton&#x27;s Connecticut-based Folk-Legacy label in 1970. His association with Folk-Legacy has continued since that time, though his more recent work (from the early 1990s on) has been released on his own label, Timberhead Music. Some of his best-known work was done as part of a trio with Ed Trickett and Ann Mayo Muir, Trickett accompanying with the hammered dulcimer and guitar and Muir with the harp and flute.

Bok is a deep bass and plays six-string guitar (both the steel-string acoustic guitar and the nylon-string classical guitar) and 12-string guitar. He also plays a self-built instrument he calls the &quot;cellamba,&quot; a six-string, fretted cello.

As a songwriter, Bok draws on his experience in and around the working boat culture of the Gulf of Maine. His lyrics include stories of fishermen and other sea-folk. At times (especially in the 1970s), he reaches into the wealth of sea myth of the North Atlantic.

In addition to writing songs, he is also a folklorist and gatherer of songs. His repertoire includes contemporary songs from North America, Australia, and the British Isles. Additionally, Bok sings, in the original languages, folksongs from Italy, Portugal, Mongolia, French Canada, Latin America, and the Hebrides, among other places, and knows a huge body of old anglophone folklore.

Bok is also an artist mainly dealing with sea themes done in wood carvings.

==Personal life==
Bok is the grandson of Edward Bok, the cousin of Derek Bok, and the uncle of Gideon Bok. He is married to Carol Rohl.

<doc id="288014" wikidata="Q7352352" url="?curid=288014" title="Robin Day">
<text>Sir Robin Day (24 October 1923 – 6 August 2000) was an English political journalist and television and radio broadcaster.

Day&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Dick Taverne stated that he was &quot;the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television, and strove to assert balance and rationality into the medium&#x27;s treatment of current affairs&quot;.

==Early life==
Robin Day was born on 24 October 1923 in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, the youngest of four children of William Day (c. 1885–c. 1948), a Post Office telephone engineer who became a GPO administrative manager, and his wife Florence. He received his early formal education at Brentwood School from 1934 to 1938, briefly attended the Crypt School, Gloucester, and later Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight.

During World War II, he received a commission into the British Army&#x27;s Royal Artillery, with which he served from 1943. He was deployed to East Africa and saw little action. He was discharged from the British Army in 1947 with the rank of Lieutenant, and went up to St Edmund Hall, Oxford to read law. While at Oxford University, he was elected president of the Oxford Union debating society, and also took part in a debating tour of the United States of America, run by the English-Speaking Union.

He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1952, but practised law only briefly.

==Journalistic career==
Day spent almost his entire working life in journalism. He rose to prominence on the new Independent Television News (ITN) from 1955. According to Dick Taverne, Day first came to notice by interviewing Sir Kenneth Clark, then chairman of the regulator Independent Television Authority. The ITA had proposed to cut ITN&#x27;s broadcasting hours and finances. His direct, non-deferential approach was then entirely new. Day was the first British journalist to interview Egypt&#x27;s President Nasser following the Suez Crisis.

In 1958, he interviewed Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, in what the &quot;Daily Express&quot; called: &quot;the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public&quot;. The interview turned Day into a television personality and was probably the first time that British television became a serious part of the political process. He was on the staff of ITN for four years, resigning to stand at the 1959 general election as a Liberal Party candidate for Hereford but was not elected. Following a brief period at the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, he moved to the BBC.

He was a regular fixture on all BBC general election night programmes from the 1960s until 1987. On television, he presented &quot;Panorama&quot; and chaired &quot;Question Time&quot; (1979–89). His incisive and sometimes – by the standards of the day – abrasive interviewing style, together with his heavy-rimmed spectacles and trademark bow tie, made him an instantly recognisable and frequently impersonated figure over five decades.

In the early 1970s, Day worked on BBC Radio, where he proved an innovator with &quot;It&#x27;s Your Line&quot; (1970–76). This was a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people, for the first time, to put questions directly to the prime minister and other politicians (it later spawned &quot;Election Call&quot;). He also presented &quot;The World at One&quot; from 1979 to 1987. In the 1981 New Year Honours, he was knighted for his services to broadcasting.

He became known in British broadcasting as &quot;the Grand Inquisitor&quot; for his abrasive interviewing of politicians, a style out of keeping with the British media&#x27;s habitual deference to authority in the early days of his career.

In October 1982, during a &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview with the Conservative Secretary of State for Defence John Nott, pursuing cuts in defence expenditure, in particular Royal Navy, Day posed the question: &quot;Why should the public on this issue believe you, a transient, here today and, if I may say so, gone tomorrow politician rather than a senior officer of many years&#x27; experience?&quot; Nott, who had announced he was to retire at the next general election, removed his own microphone and walked off the set. Nott&#x27;s autobiography in 2003 was called &quot;Here Today Gone Tomorrow: Recollections of an Errant Politician&quot; in reference to the incident.

After leaving &quot;Question Time&quot;, Day moved to the new satellite service BSB, where he presented the weekly political discussion programme &quot;Now Sir Robin&quot;. When BSB merged with Sky Television, the programme continued to be broadcast on Sky News for a while. During the 1992 general election campaign, he returned to the BBC to host round table discussions with senior politicians on BBC Breakfast News and he also conducted long-form interviews with all three main party leaders for ITV as part of the Thames Television programme This Week. On the night of the 1992 general election itself, Day resumed his role as interviewer, this time on ITN&#x27;s general election night coverage, broadcast on ITV.

During the mid-1990s, he regularly contributed to the lunchtime Channel 4 political programme &quot;Around the House&quot; and presented &quot;Central Lobby&quot; for Central, the ITV franchise in the Midlands. That show was sometimes aired at the same time as his old programme &quot;Question Time&quot; was being broadcast by the BBC.

For 25 years, he campaigned tirelessly, and eventually successfully, for the televising of Parliament – not in the interests of television, but of Parliament itself. He claimed that he was the first to present the detailed arguments in favour, in a Hansard Society paper in 1963.

&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; often referred to Day – for example, in the &quot;Eddie Baby&quot; sketch, in which John Cleese turns to the camera and states: &quot;Robin Day&#x27;s got a hedgehog called Frank.&quot; In another sketch, Eric Idle said that he was able to return his &quot;Robin Day tie&quot; to Harrods. Day was also spoofed (as &quot;Robin Yad&quot;) on &quot;The Goodies&#x27;&quot; episode &quot;Saturday Night Grease&quot;. Day appeared as himself on an installment of the Morecambe and Wise show, in which he berates Ernie Wise in character. Then Eric Morecambe, acting as a TV presenter, says: &quot;Sadly, we&#x27;ve come to the end of today&#x27;s &#x27;Friendly Discussion with Robin Day&#x27;.&quot;

Day was also frequently lampooned by the satirical TV programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. In this, he would frequently be shown interviewing then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who would always give answers somewhat unrelated to the question. The breathing difficulties that affected him later in life were represented: &quot;My name is Robin (deep breath) Day.&quot;

His last regular TV work was &quot;Robin Day&#x27;s Book Talk&quot;, which aired in the early days of BBC News 24 in around 1998. The programme featured interviews and discussions about books, broadly around a political theme. On occasions, it took the form of a one-on-one interview, while on other occasions it consisted of a panel discussion.

==Autobiographies==
Day&#x27;s two autobiographies were entitled &quot;Day by Day&quot; (1975) and &quot;Grand Inquisitor&quot; (1989).

==Death==
Day died from heart complications, aged 76, on the evening of 6 August 2000, at the Wellington Hospital in London.

A funeral service was held at the chapel of Mortlake Crematorium, where his body was cremated. His ashes were buried in a grave near the south door of the Church of St Candida and Holy Cross, at Whitchurch Canonicorum in the county of Dorset. The grave&#x27;s memorial stone bears the words: &quot;In loving memory of Sir Robin Day – The Grand Inquisitor&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1965, Day married Katherine Ainslie, an Australian law don at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford; the couple had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1986. Day&#x27;s elder son suffered multiple skull fractures in a childhood fall, and never fully recovered.

In the 1980s, Day had a coronary bypass, and he suffered from breathing problems that were often evident when he was on the air. He had always fought against a tendency to put on weight. As an undergraduate, he weighed , and claimed that, in the course of his life, he had succeeded in losing more weight than any other person.

The broadcaster Joan Bakewell recalled that, while Day was professional when in the office, he was disrespectful towards female newsreaders: &quot;Socially he was a menace. There was no subtlety in his manner: at office parties he would attack head on. &#x27;Do the men you interview fancy you? Do they stare at your legs? Do they stare at your breasts? Do you sleep with many of them?&#x27; ... Whenever he loomed in sight, I made myself scarce.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
Day is portrayed by Bertie Carvel in the episode &quot;Marionettes&quot; in season 2 of the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

He was parodied in The Goodies episode &quot;Saturday Night Grease&quot; in 1980.

He was referenced in Monty Pythons Flying Circus in the “It’s the Arts” sketch, where according to John Cleese, he “had a hedgehog called Frank”. The version of the sketch 1971 film adaption And Now for Something Completely Different changed Day to President Nixon.

<text>Jason Ringenberg (born November 22, 1958) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and guitarist and the lead singer of Jason &amp; the Scorchers. The band had several hits, including &quot;Golden Ball and Chain&quot; and a rock version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Absolutely Sweet Marie.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Ringenberg was born in Kewanee, Illinois, and grew up in nearby Sheffield, Illinois, where his parents owned a family hog farm that bordered the Rock Island Railroad line. He started playing in rock, alternative rock, and country-bands while in school at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

== Career ==
In 1981, Ringenberg moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he soon formed Jason &amp; the Scorchers with Warner Hodges, Jeff Johnson, and Perry Baggs. They used a mix of punk rock and country. Rolling Stone has commented that they &quot;singlehandedly re-wrote the history of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll in the South&quot;. They won critical approval with the release of several albums and live performances.

Ringenberg was influential in the early to mid 1980s when the indie country/rock movement was at its height. His music, along with similar bands, founded the emergence of the alternative country and Americana genres within indie rock music.

In 2008, Jason &amp; the Scorchers received the Americana Music Association&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in the Performance Category.

Ringenberg has also seen success as a solo artist. He has released five solo records and toured as a solo artist. &quot;The Times&quot; (London) called him &quot;one of the most exciting performers of his generation.&quot; He now performs both solo as Jason Ringenberg and as his children&#x27;s music character, Farmer Jason, often performing as both personas in the same day.

Ringenberg created his children&#x27;s music character, Farmer Jason, in 2002 to entertain his own daughters. He then released his first children&#x27;s record on the Yep Roc Records label; &quot;A Day at the Farm with Farmer Jason&quot;, in 2003. The character remains popular and has become the most successful project of his career. As Farmer Jason, he sings songs about farm animals and the appreciation of nature. His PBS mini program called &quot;It&#x27;s a Farmer Jason&quot; has earned four Emmy nominations and one Emmy win. He has recorded four records and a DVD as Farmer Jason. The fourth album, &quot;Christmas on the Farm with Farmer Jason&quot;, was released in December 2014.

His album &quot;Stand Tall&quot; (2019) was written while he was Artist in Residence at Sequoia National Park. Recorded at his old college haunts in Southern Illinois and also in Nashville, the subjects of the songs range from John the Baptist to The Ramones to a disillusioned Confederate draftee.

==Personal life==
Ringenberg lives near Bon Aqua, Tennessee, with his wife Suzy; daughters Kelsey, Addie, and Camille; and a barnyard full of animals.

<text>Christopher C. Faust (born 1955 in Fort Riley, Kansas) is a landscape photographer in St. Paul, Minnesota. He holds a degree in biology from St. Cloud State University and an MS in educational media from St. Cloud State University.
He is best known for his panoramic photographs of landscapes. From 1990 to 1996 he created a series of black-and-white images of new suburban development, especially in Minnesota, USA. Many of these depict new structures and spaces not yet fully formed, and not yet inhabited by people. A frequent theme in these and other series is the intersection of human beings with nature, and places where the two interact in visually provocative ways.

An example is &quot;The Edge, Eden Prairie, MN&quot; which is in the collection of the Walker Art Center. This photograph appears to be a split, double image, but is actually a single scene, depicting where a suburban development near Minneapolis, Minnesota runs up against prairie vegetation. The imported, landscaped vegetation, especially the central tree, conifers, and lawn grass balance the smaller native tree and prairie grass of the other half, as the condominiums loom from a corner.

Other of his series include outdoor industrial scenes typical of the northern Midwest, like grain elevators and railcars, rural landscapes from Minnesota and Appalachia, and color photographs of natural scenes.

Faust&#x27;s work is exhibited regularly in galleries around Minnesota. His work appears in a number of institutions and is held by the permanent collections of the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Weisman Art Museum, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Twenty of Faust&#x27;s photographs, many of them from his Suburban Documentation Project, illustrate the 1997 book &quot;Placing Nature: Culture and Landscape Ecology&quot;, edited by landscape architect Joan Iverson Nassauer, and including essays by novelist Jane Smiley and philosopher Marcia Muelder Eaton. Faust has been honored with McKnight Foundation Fellowships in 1989, 1992, and 1997. Faust is now a media teacher at Gordon Parks High School, St.Paul MN..

Faust takes a majority of his photographs using a specially designed Fuji G617.
