<text>Malingering is the fabrication, feigning, or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms designed to achieve a desired outcome, such as personal gain, relief from duty or work, avoiding arrest, receiving medication, or mitigating prison sentencing. It presents a complex ethical dilemma within domains of society, including healthcare, legal systems, and employment settings.

Although malingering is not a medical diagnosis, it may be recorded as a &quot;focus of clinical attention&quot; or a &quot;reason for contact with health services&quot;. It is coded by both the ICD-10 and DSM-5. The intent of malingerers vary. For example, the homeless may fake a mental illness to gain hospital admission. Impacts of failure to detect malingering are extensive, impacting insurance industries, healthcare systems, public safety, and veterans&#x27; disability benefits. Malingered behaviour typically ends as soon as the external goal is obtained.

Malingering is established as separate from similar forms of excessive illness behaviour, such as somatization disorder, wherein symptoms are not deliberately falsified. Another disorder is factitious disorder, which lacks a desire for secondary, external gain. Both of these are recognised as diagnosable by the DSM-5. However, not all medical professionals are in agreement with these distinctions.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
According to 1 Samuel in the Old Testament, King David feigned madness to Achish, the king of the Philistines. Some scholars believe this was not feigned but real epilepsy, and phrasing in the Septuagint supports that position.

Odysseus was said to have feigned insanity to avoid participating in the Trojan War.

Malingering was recorded in Roman times by the physician Galen, who reported two cases: one patient simulated colic to avoid a public meeting, and another feigned an injured knee to avoid accompanying his master on a long journey.

===Renaissance===
In 1595, a treatise on feigned diseases was published in Milan by Giambattista Silvatico.

Various phases of malingering () are represented in the etchings and engravings of Jacques Callot (1592–1635).

In his Elizabethan-era social-climbing manual, George Puttenham recommends a would-be courtier to have &quot;sickness in his sleeve, thereby to shake off other importunities of greater consequence&quot;.

=== Modern period ===
Although the concept of malingering has existed since time immemorial, the term for malingering was introduced in the 1900s due to those who would feign illness or disability to avoid military service. In 1943, US Army General George S. Patton found a soldier in a field hospital with no wounds; the soldier claimed to be suffering from battle fatigue. Believing the patient was malingering, Patton flew into a rage and physically assaulted him. The patient had malarial parasites.

Agnes was the first subject of an in-depth discussion of transgender identity in sociology, published by Harold Garfinkel in 1967. In the 1950s, Agnes feigned symptoms and lied about almost every aspect of her medical history. Garfinkel concluded that fearing she would be denied access to sexual reassignment surgery, she had avoided every aspect of her case which would have indicated gender dysphoria and hidden the fact that she had taken hormone therapy. Physicians observing her feminine appearance therefore concluded she had testicular feminization syndrome, which legitimized her request for the surgery.

==Types==
Classifying malingering behaviour into different categories allows for an easier assessment of possible deception, as created by Robert Resnick.
As individuals within institutions grapple with the challenges posed by malingering, a critical examination ethical duties emerges as imperative. Balancing compassion for those genuinely in need with the responsibility to uphold integrity and fairness, ethical obligations in addressing malingering extend beyond mere detection to encompass considerations of empathy, justice, and the broader implications for trust and societal welfare. 
* Pure malingering: feigning a disorder or illness that is nonexistent. It is arguably the most simple to detect. This is because malingerers of this type tend to provide unreliable, additional symptoms when describing their supposed disorder, since they have to create an entire story from scratch. It is, therefore, difficult to entirely accurately mimic real-world scenarios.
* Partial malingering: purposefully exaggerating symptoms for an existing disorder or illness. This may be particularly difficult to detect, because those who partake in this would be building on their own genuine traumatic experiences, rather than completely falsifying claims.
* False imputation: attributing of existing symptoms to a cause that the patient knows is unrelated to their illness. Identifying this type of malingering is less difficult than partial malingering, as patients may inaccurately transpose symptoms from their real experience to the supposed cause of their disorder. This entails inaccurate storytelling and would indicate deliberate deception.

==Society and culture==
=== Post-traumatic stress disorder ===

Veterans may be denied disability benefits if their doctor believes that they are malingering, especially regarding post-traumatic stress disorder. In navigating these ethical dimensions, it becomes essential to foster a nuanced understanding that acknowledges the complexities inherent in distinguishing genuine suffering from deceptive behavior, while also safeguarding against the misuse of resources and the erosion of trust in systems designed to support those in need. PTSD is the only condition for which the DSM-5 explicitly warns clinicians to observe in case of malingering. Distinguishing malingered PTSD from genuine symptoms is challenging due to the range of the nature and severity of the disorder. An assessment showed that in over 10% of cases, veterans were falsifying or exaggerating their service history.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
Research that focuses on malingering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are largely centred around university or college students. This is because of the significant benefits that may be gained if the student is successful, including student financial aid and exemptions for academic work. Medicinal treatments of ADHD may also be nootropics, which would enhance cognitive performance in examinations.

=== Legal issues ===
Malingering is a court-martial offense in the United States military under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which defines the term as &quot;feign[ing] illness, physical disablement, mental lapse, or derangement.&quot; According to the Texas Department of Insurance, fraud that includes malingering costs the US insurance industry approximately $150 billion each year. Other non-industry sources report it may be as low as $5.4 billion.

== Detection ==
Richard Rogers and Daniel Shuman found that the use of DSM-5 criteria results in a true-positive rate of only 13.6% to 20.1%; that is, among persons whom the criteria indicate to be malingering, only 13.6% to 20.1% are actual malingerers. The remaining 79.9% to 86.4% whom those criteria indicate to be malingering are in fact false positives, &quot;i.e.&quot;, non-malingerers erroneously classified as malingerers. Being falsely accused of malingering may cause adverse reactions, some of which lead to violence. Thus, the accurate detection of malingering is a pressing societal issue.

=== Tests ===
There are multiple methods to evaluate malingering, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2, which is the most validated test. Other tests include the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms, which is used for psychiatric symptoms, and the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), intended for false memory deficits. Culture and education also likely affect overall performance in these tests. Research found that Colombian adults with low literacy skills perform significantly worse on the Test of Memory Malingering, so there are concerns with the impact of education levels on malingering assessments.

Existing criteria for one malingered disorder may not be applicable to a different disorder. For example, tests for malingered PTSD may not work for malingered neurocognitive disorders; therefore, there is a need for newer criteria to be created.

=== Indicative behaviour ===
Although there is no singular test that definitively discerns malingering, medical professionals are told to watch out for certain behaviours that may indicate deliberate deception.

Signs that illustrate malingering include:

* providing contradictory statements about symptoms;
* dramatic or peculiar behaviour that is meant to be convincing;
* behaviour that is inconsistent with described symptoms;
* acting adverse to accepting treatment for their supposed disorder;
* overenthusiasm about negative symptoms through going into extensive detail;
* sudden termination or onset of symptoms

<text>The Pittsburgh Pirates were an American professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL), based in Pittsburgh from 1925–26 to 1929–30. The nickname comes from the baseball team also based in the city. For the 1930–31 season, the team moved to Philadelphia, and played one season as the Philadelphia Quakers.

==History==

===Early days===
The Pittsburgh Pirates are traced back to the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the United States Amateur Hockey Association. The Yellow Jackets, under manager Roy Schooley and coach Dick Carroll, won back-to-back USAHA championships in the league&#x27;s last two seasons, 1923–24 and 1924–25. The players on this team formed the core of a newly professional Pittsburgh club that was granted a franchise by the National Hockey League on November 7, 1925. Pittsburgh&#x27;s admission to the NHL came after Eddie Livingstone, the former owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association saw Pittsburgh as a possible member for a proposed rival league to the NHL; Pittsburgh had, in the 1890s, been the first metropolitan area to professionalize the game of ice hockey. In order to thwart the new league, the President of the NHL, Frank Calder, negotiated to put a franchise in Pittsburgh, which became the seventh team to join the NHL as well as the league&#x27;s third US-based team. The team took the name Pittsburgh Pirates after receiving permission from Barney Dreyfuss, the owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team.

The Pirates were assigned to what would later be called the NHL&#x27;s American Division, with the Boston Bruins and the New York Americans. These two franchises were the only other American teams in the NHL at the time. Duquesne Garden, located in the city&#x27;s Oakland neighborhood, served as the team&#x27;s home arena. Duquesne Garden president Henry Townsend was the club&#x27;s president and owner. The Pirates, dubbed the &quot;Mighty Steel City Sextet&quot; in the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;, were mostly leftovers from the former Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. Ten former Yellow Jacket players would play for the Pirates.

===The inaugural season===
The Pirates began play during the 1925–26 NHL season. On November 26, 1925, Thanksgiving night, the Pirates defeated the Boston Bruins, 2–1, on the road in their very first NHL game, which was held at Boston Arena. Defenseman and captain Lionel Conacher scored Pittsburgh&#x27;s first-ever NHL goal. Conacher beat Boston goaltender Charles Stewart at the 17:50 mark of the second period to tie the game at 1–1. Pirates&#x27; left winger Harold Darragh notched Pittsburgh&#x27;s first game-winning goal 9:20 into the third period, while Pittsburgh goaltender Roy Worters stopped 26 of 27 shots to record the first NHL win in franchise and city history.

Two nights later, on November 28, the Pirates stunned the Montreal Canadiens, defeating them 1–0. The 1–0 loss to the Pirates marked the final game for legendary Canadiens&#x27; goaltender Georges Vezina. Vezina started the game with severe chest pains and left the game during the first intermission with a high fever. He died four months later from tuberculosis. Meanwhile, the first NHL game ever played in Pittsburgh was on December 2, 1925, in which 8,200 fans paid $1.00 each to see the 8:30 p.m. faceoff at Duquesne Garden. The Pirates lost to the New York Americans in overtime, 2–1. Conacher scored the lone goal for Pittsburgh at 9:15 of the second period.

In 36 games, the Pirates posted an impressive 19–16–1 record for third best in the league. With a .542 winning percentage, that first season would arguably be the team&#x27;s best. During the playoffs, the Pirates faced the Montreal Maroons in a two-game series to be decided on total goals scored. The Pirates lost the series six goals to four after a 3–1 defeat at Duquesne Garden and a 3–3 tie at Montreal. The Maroons would go on to win the 1926 Stanley Cup Finals.

===1926–1928===
In the next season, the Pirates missed the playoffs after finishing in fourth place. Their third season saw the team post a 19–17–8 record and earn a playoff spot. This playoff series would be based on a two-game total goal series format. In the playoffs, the Pirates were defeated by the New York Rangers, 6–4. The Pirates lost 4–0 in game 1, and won game 2, 4–2, but could not overcome New York&#x27;s lead in goals. This marked the second time the team lost in the first round to the eventual Stanley Cup winner. It would also turn out to be the last playoff game in the Pirates&#x27; history.

===Decline===
In October 1928, brothers Horace and Edward Townsend, who had inherited ownership of the club from their late father Henry Townsend, sold the team. The ostensible purchaser was fight promoter and ex-lightweight boxing champion Benny Leonard, although the money for the purchase is suspected to have come from early Prohibition gangster and bootlegger Bill Dwyer, owner of the New York Americans, who may have hid his involvement with the Pittsburgh club to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. The sale of the team did not lead to an improvement on the ice for the Pirates. The team&#x27;s coach, Odie Cleghorn left the team at the end of the 1928–29 season to become a referee. Frank Fredrickson was then named the team&#x27;s coach. The team&#x27;s uniforms also changed, as the Pirates&#x27; color scheme became blue and gold in 1928–29 and then orange and black in 1929–30.

The 1929–30 season was their fifth season in the NHL, and their last in Pittsburgh. The season saw the Pirates achieve their worst win–loss record with 5–36–3 record. With the Wall Street Crash of 1929, followed by the Great Depression, the owners found themselves in financial difficulties. Attendance for games was down and the owners tried selling off their star players in order to make ends meet. The team was $400,000 in debt by the end of their final season. It also needed replacement for the Duquesne Garden. It had been built in 1890 and had once been one of the finest arenas in the country. However, it had not aged well, and by 1930 was well behind the times. With only 5,000 permanent seats and standing room for 8,000, it was by far the smallest arena in the NHL, making it difficult for the Pirates to break even.

===Relocation===
On October 18, 1930, at the NHL Board of Governors&#x27; meeting, Leonard moved the team across Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia, and renamed them the Philadelphia Quakers. However, Leonard&#x27;s intention was to return the team to Pittsburgh as soon as a new arena was built. Thirteen players from the Pirates were transferred to the Quakers after the Pittsburgh franchise relocated. These players were Cliff Barton, Harold Darragh, Herb Drury, Gord Frasier, Jim Jarvis, Gerry Lowrey, Rennison Manners, Johnny McKinnon, Hib Milks, Joe Miller, Rodger Smith, and Tex White. Frank Fredrickson was also transferred to the Quakers, but he was released by Philadelphia two days later. The Quakers posted a poor 4–36–4 record in the 1930–31 season. The team then received permission from the NHL on September 26, 1931, to temporally cease operations as they sought a new permanent arena, located in either Pittsburgh or Philadelphia.

Meanwhile, the poor economy was taking a toll on the entire league. The Great Depression devastated the NHL as four teams were forced to fold, leaving behind just six teams. When a new Pittsburgh arena failed to materialize, Leonard surrendered his franchise in 1936. As it turned out, a new arena in Pittsburgh would not be built until the Pittsburgh Civic Arena opened in 1961. The NHL would play with six teams for 25 years before deciding to expand. The expansion in 1967 brought the Pittsburgh Penguins to the NHL and the city of Pittsburgh and the orange and black-uniformed Philadelphia Flyers to Philadelphia. 

The last remaining active member of the Pittsburgh Pirates was Cliff Barton, who played his final NHL game in the 1939–40 season, where he won the Stanley Cup as a member of the New York Rangers.

==Historic firsts==
The Pittsburgh Pirates have left their mark in the NHL record books and NHL history with many firsts and other notable achievements.

* Odie Cleghorn, the Pirates&#x27; coach (and occasional player) for the first four seasons, was the first NHL coach to change his players on the fly. This article from the December 21, 1925, &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; describes how Cleghorn would change the forward line halfway through each period with another set of attackers, who would play for &quot;six or eight minutes&quot;. The first line would then come back on to finish the period. The defencemen were not changed.
* Cleghorn was also the first coach to use three set forward lines, which was a huge change from the standard, which was to simply leave the best players out for as long as possible.
* The Pirates set an NHL record in salaries by signing defenceman Lionel Conacher to a three-year deal worth $7,500 a year. Conacher was later named Canada&#x27;s athlete of the half-century.
* On December 26, 1926 the Pirates and the New York Americans combined for what still stands as the NHL record for most shots in one game. The two teams combined for 141 shots in a 3–1 New York win. Roy Worters made 70 saves for the Pirates and Jake Forbes made 67 saves for the Americans.

==Logos and uniforms==
The Pirates were one of the first teams in Pittsburgh to use the black &amp; gold color scheme, basing their colors around the Flag of Pittsburgh&#x27;s colors. They were predated in that regard by their own predecessor, the Yellow Jackets, as well as the 1912 Pittsburgh Filipinos and 1924 Pittsburgh Pirates baseball teams. Decades after the team folded, the colors have become the team colors of all three of Pittsburgh&#x27;s major sports teams. However, during the team&#x27;s existence, they would be the only team in the city with the colors, as the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, like all other baseball teams at the time, had a more patriotic red, white, and blue color scheme and wouldn&#x27;t permanently adopt black &amp; gold until 1948. Meanwhile, the NFL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Steelers would not exist until 1933, three years after the team left town and two years after the franchise folded altogether.

The Pirates would later have a connection with Pittsburgh&#x27;s next NHL franchise; the Pittsburgh Penguins. In January 1980, the Boston Bruins protested to the NHL over the Penguins proposed change in team colors, from blue (in light and dark shades) and white to black and gold (colors present on the Penguins&#x27; logo). The Penguins used the Pirates as an example of an NHL team, other than the Bruins, that used the black &amp; gold color scheme; in addition, black and gold was not even the Bruins&#x27; original color scheme, as they wore brown and gold (the colors of Bruins founder Charles Adams&#x27; First National grocery stores) until 1935. The NHL allowed the Penguins to change their colors as a result of the Pirates using these colors.

The Pirates wore bright yellow wool jerseys with black trim stripes with a &quot;P&quot; on the front of their jerseys during the 1925–1926 season. The team used the Pittsburgh&#x27;s city crest emblems from older police jackets on the uniform sleeves. The first year jerseys appear to have been inherited from the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets old jerseys. The Pirates featured new jerseys in 1928–29 that were gold with blue striping. The word &quot;Pirates&quot; written in arched, blocked lettering. The city crest on the sleeves was replaced with a &quot;P&quot;.

In 1929–30, the Pirates switched to black and orange uniforms for their fifth and final season. The wool jerseys featured a chain-knit logo of a pirate face with an eye patch and hat with skull and cross bones. The jersey featured double striping on the sleeves and a diagonal background behind the crest. The orange and black remained when the Pirates moved across the state to become the Quakers, Philadelphia&#x27;s first NHL team, adopting script lettering like the original Pirates&#x27; uniforms. When the Philadelphia Flyers joined the NHL in 1967, they adopted the orange and black colors first worn by the Pirates and Quakers.

<text>The Quebec Bulldogs () were a men&#x27;s senior-level ice hockey team based in Quebec City. The team was officially known as the Quebec Hockey Club (), and later as the Quebec Athletic Club (). One of the first organized ice hockey clubs, the club debuted in 1878 with the opening of the Quebec Skating Rink. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908. The club would play in the National Hockey Association (the forerunner to the NHL) and the National Hockey League. In 1920, the team moved to Hamilton, Ontario and became the Hamilton Tigers.

==History==

===Amateur roots, 1878–1909===
The Quebec Hockey Club was founded in 1878, after the construction of the Quebec Skating Rink in 1877. The club consisted of Anglo-Canadian players. Play was by exhibition only, against teams drawn from the club members or visiting teams from Montreal. In 1883, the club played in the Montreal Winter Carnival, and joined the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) in 1888 and were members until 1898. After the AHAC, Quebec played in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League from 1899 to 1905, and the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association from 1906 to 1909. One player that went through the ranks of the Quebec Hockey Club was David Watson (1869–1922), a journalist and newspaper owner who fought as a Major-General in World War I. Watson played for the Quebec HC as a cover point (an offensive defenceman) in the AHAC through the course of the 1890s.

The club came close to winning the Stanley Cup on two occasions. In the 1894 season Quebec tied for the AHAC regular season lead with three other clubs. The AHAC drew up plans to hold the playoff solely in Montreal. Quebec declined to play in Montreal without one game in Quebec and the championship was eventually won by the Montreal Hockey Club. In 1904, Quebec won the CAHL outright. In a dispute, the club did not win the Stanley Cup or challenge for it. The Ottawa Hockey Club was the defending champions in 1903–04, but withdrew from the league. Quebec went on to win the CAHL and expected to receive the Stanley Cup as league champions. The trustees of the Cup instead ruled that the Cup went to Ottawa.

Two significant players on the Quebec Hockey Club during the later part of the first decade of the 1900s were Chubby and Joe Power, who would both later serve as politicians in Quebec. A third Power brother, Rockett Power, also represented the club.

===National Hockey Association===
In late 1909, Quebec became a founding member of the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) in 1909. The CHA, however, would only last one month before being absorbed into the much more powerful National Hockey Association (NHA). Rejected by the new league, the Bulldogs sat out the inaugural 1910 season. The following season, 1910–11, the Bulldogs took over the defunct Cobalt Silver Kings franchise, but had a rough initiation, finishing dead last with four wins and 12 losses in a 16-game season. On a positive note, and a sign of things to come, Jack McDonald scored 14 goals and Tommy Dunderdale scored 13.

For 1911–12, the Bulldogs went from worst to first, with Joe Malone having a spectacular season, to win the O&#x27;Brien Cup as champions of the NHA and the Stanley Cup. The Dogs&#x27; record improved to 10 wins and eight losses while Malone scored 21 goals and Jack McDonald scored 18. In a Stanley Cup challenge, they crushed the Moncton Victorias in two games, 9–3 and 8–0, in the best-of-three playoff.
In their third season (1912–13), Quebec would again finish first overall with a record of 16-4 losses to retain the championship. Joe Malone won the scoring race with an unprecedented 43 goals. His teammate, Tommy Smith, was a close second with 39. In a Stanley Cup challenge after the season the team easily beat the Sydney Millionaires in two games by a combined score of 20-5.

The Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association next challenged the Bulldogs. The powerhouse Bulldogs expected to bowl over the Aristocrats, but were shocked after splitting the first two games and then losing 6–1 in the decisive third game. However, the Stanley Cup Board of trustees did not recognise the challenge because it should have been played in Quebec. PCHA leader Lester Patrick refused. The Bulldogs were able to keep the Cup.

In December 1913, the Bulldogs moved to the new Quebec Arena. The following seasons would see the Bulldogs drop from the top of the league. They would finish third overall in each of the next three seasons and in the last NHA season (1916–17) went second overall. After their two Stanley Cup wins, though, they would never again challenge for the Cup.

===National Hockey League and the move to Hamilton 1917–1925===
The Bulldogs, along with the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa Senators, were frustrated with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone&#x27;s acrimonious dealings. However, they discovered that the league constitution did not allow them to simply vote Livingstone out. Instead, the four clubs joined in founding the National Hockey League in 1917, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. Quebec&#x27;s long-time manager Mike Quinn had retired due to ill health. The other directors of the Bulldogs were unable to get enough financing to make the move to the NHL—no small consideration given that Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the league. They opted to suspend operations for the league&#x27;s inaugural season. To balance out the schedule, the remaining three clubs granted a temporary franchise to the Toronto Arena Company, the direct ancestors of today&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs.

In 1918, the franchise was sold in principle to Percy Quinn. Quinn&#x27;s actual intent was to use the Bulldogs to help resurrect the NHA. However, the other owners called Quinn&#x27;s bluff by demanding a firm commitment to ice a team in the NHL for the 1918–19 season. When Quinn refused to do so, the NHL canceled the franchise. When no other Quebec-based group came forward, the Bulldogs sat out the 1918–19 season as well.

In May 1919, NHL president Calder and Mike Quinn made efforts to return Quebec to the league. Calder suggested that Quinn apply to the league for a new franchise. On December 2, 1919, the NHL approved the application of the Quebec Athletic Club for an NHL franchise. Newspapers at the time now referred to the team as the &quot;Quebec Athletics&quot; rather than &quot;Bulldogs&quot;.

While the team had been suspended, their star player, Joe Malone, played for the Canadiens. Malone rejoined the franchise, and won the scoring championship that year with 39 goals. Despite Malone&#x27;s scoring and the presence of players like Harry Mummery, Quebec had a dismal season, finishing last, with 4 wins and 20 losses.

Before the 1920–21 season, the NHL took back the franchise, and sold it to new owners who moved the team to Hamilton, where it became the Tigers. This helped to head off a potential competing league organized by Livingstone from setting up in Hamilton.

The Tigers played in the NHL from 1920 to 1925. Due in large part to a team players&#x27; strike in the 1925 NHL playoffs, the franchise was revoked a second time that summer, this time for good. The entire Tigers roster was then sold to Bill Dwyer, owner of the expansion New York Americans franchise. However, the NHL does not reckon the Americans as a continuation of the Bulldogs/Tigers franchise. The Americans would play in the NHL from 1925 to 1942.

The last active Bulldogs player in major-league hockey was Dave Ritchie, who retired in 1926. The last active Bulldog player was Eddie Oatman, who played pro hockey until 1939 and played against the CAHL Quebec Beavers in 1929.

Over time, various hockey teams played in Quebec, including the minor-pro Quebec Castors and Quebec Aces. Big-league hockey would not return to Quebec City until the Quebec Nordiques were founded in 1972 as part of the new World Hockey Association. They joined the NHL in 1979. However, as with the Bulldogs, they found the going difficult playing in the league&#x27;s smallest market. They moved to Denver in 1995 as the Colorado Avalanche. A potential National Hockey League expansion bid for Quebec City has been tabled by the league&#x27;s board of governors since 2015.

<text>The New York Americans, colloquially known as the Amerks, were a professional ice hockey team based in New York City from 1925 to 1942. They were the third expansion team in the history of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the second to play in the United States. The team never won the Stanley Cup, but reached the semifinals twice. While it was the first team in New York City, it was eclipsed by the second, the New York Rangers, which arrived in 1926 under the ownership of the Amerks&#x27; landlord, Madison Square Garden. The team played as the Brooklyn Americans during the 1941–42 season before suspending operations in 1942 due to World War II and long-standing financial difficulties. The demise of the club marked the beginning of the NHL&#x27;s Original Six era from 1942 to 1967, though the Amerks&#x27; franchise was not formally canceled until 1946. The team&#x27;s overall regular season record was 255–402–127.

==History==

===Formation===

In 1923, Canadian sports promoter Thomas Duggan received options on three NHL franchises for the United States. He sold one to Boston grocery magnate Charles Adams, which became the Boston Bruins in 1924. Duggan then arranged with Tex Rickard to have a team in Madison Square Garden. Rickard agreed, but play was delayed until the new Garden was built in 1925. In April 1925, Duggan and Bill Dwyer, New York City&#x27;s most-celebrated Prohibition bootlegger, were awarded the franchise for New York. Somewhat fortuitously given the shortage of players, the Hamilton Tigers, who had finished first the season before, had been suspended from the league after they struck for higher pay. However, the suspensions were quietly lifted in the off-season. Soon afterward, Dwyer duly bought the collective rights to the Tigers&#x27; players for $75,000. He gave the players healthy raises – in some cases, double their 1924–25 season&#x27;s salaries. Just before the season, Dwyer announced the team would be known as the New York Americans. Their original jerseys were covered with stars and stripes, patterned after the American flag. Although he acquired the Tigers&#x27; players, Dwyer did not acquire the franchise; as it was expelled from the league. As a result, the NHL does not consider the Americans to be a continuation of the Tigers, or for that matter, of the Tigers&#x27; predecessors, the Quebec Bulldogs. The Americans entered the league in the 1925–26 season along with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Americans and Pirates became the second and third American-based teams in the NHL, following Adams&#x27; Boston Bruins, who had begun play during the 1924–25 season.

===NHL years===

The Americans played their first home game at the Garden, losing 3–1 to the Montreal Canadiens in front of 17,000 people. However, success did not come easily for the Americans. Despite icing essentially the same team that finished first the previous year, they finished fifth overall in their first season with a record of 12–22–4. However, they were a success at the box office, so much so that the following season Garden management sought a team of its own. A clause in the Amerks&#x27; lease with the Garden required them to support any bid for the Garden to acquire its own NHL franchise. The Garden had promised Dwyer that it would never exercise that option, and that the Amerks would be the only team in the arena. However, when the Garden opted to seek a house team after all, the Amerks had little choice but to agree to the creation of what became the New York Rangers.

The 1926–27 season saw the Americans continue to struggle, finishing 17–25–2. Part of the problem was that they were placed in the Canadian Division in defiance of all geographic reality, resulting in a larger number of train trips to Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa. Meanwhile, the Rangers won the American Division title. The next season saw the Americans fall even further by finishing last in their division (ninth overall) with a record of 11–27–6, while the Rangers captured the Stanley Cup in only their second year of existence. The Americans were thus doomed to a long history as New York City&#x27;s second team.

The 1928–29 season saw the Amerks sign star goaltender Roy Worters from the Pittsburgh Pirates. He led the team to a 19–13–12 record in that season, good enough for second in the Canadian Division (fourth overall). Worters had a 1.21 goals against average (GAA), becoming the first goaltender to win the Hart Trophy as the most valuable player in the league. Standing on Worters&#x27; shoulders, the Americans made the playoffs for the first time, but were unable to beat the Rangers in a total-goals series. The Rangers had extreme difficulty scoring against Worters, but the futile Americans were equally unable to score against the Rangers. The Rangers ended up winning the series in the second game, 1–0 in overtime.

The following season saw the Americans plunge to fifth place in the division (ninth overall) with a 14–25–5 record. Worters followed up his stellar 1928–29 season with an atrocious 3.75 goals against average. Worters rebounded the next season, with a 1.68 goals against average. That was good enough to give the Americans a winning record. However, they missed out on a playoff berth since the Montreal Maroons had two more wins, which was the NHL&#x27;s first tiebreaker for playoff seeding.

The 1931–32 season saw some developments that changed the way ice hockey was played. In a game against the Bruins, the Americans iced the puck 61 times. At that time, there was no rule against icing. Adams was so angry that he pressed, to no avail, for the NHL to make a rule against icing, so the next time the two teams met, the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a scoreless game. It was not until a few years later that the NHL made a rule prohibiting icing, but those two games were the catalyst for change.
The Americans&#x27; lackluster on-ice performance was not the only problem for the franchise. With the end of Prohibition, Dwyer was finding it difficult to make ends meet. After the 1933–34 season, having missed the playoffs for the fifth straight year, the Americans attempted a merger with the equally strapped Ottawa Senators, only to be turned down by the NHL Board of Governors. During the 1935–36 season, Dwyer decided to sell the team. As fortunes had it, the Americans made the playoffs for the first time in six years under player-coach Red Dutton, but bowed out in the second round against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Even with this rebound, no buyers came forward, prompting Dwyer to abandon the team. The league announced a takeover of the team for the next season. Dwyer sued the NHL, saying it had no authority to seize his team. A settlement was reached whereby Dwyer could resume control provided he could pay off his debts by the end of the season. However, Dwyer could not do so, and the NHL took full control of the franchise. Despite the presence of Dutton, who had retired as a player to become coach and general manager, the team fared no better under the league&#x27;s operation than before, finishing last with a record of 15–29–4. The only bright spot was Sweeney Schriner, who led the league in scoring that year.

The league asked Dutton to become operating head of the franchise for the 1937–38 season. The Americans signed veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day and acquired goaltender Earl Robertson. These new acquisitions greatly helped the team as they finished the season with a 19–18–11 record and made the playoffs. In the playoffs, they beat the Rangers in three games, but lost to the Chicago Black Hawks in three.
The Americans made the playoffs again in 1938–39 and 1939–40 seasons, but were bounced in the first round each time. Canada entered World War II in September 1939, and some of the team&#x27;s Canadian players left for military service. An even larger number of players entered the military in 1940–41. With a decimated roster, the Americans missed the playoffs with a record of 8–29–11, the worst in franchise history. While the league&#x27;s other teams were similarly hard-hit, Dutton was still bogged down by lingering debt from the Dwyer era. This debt, combined with the depletion of talent and wartime travel restrictions, forced Dutton to sell off his best players for cash. The Amerks were clearly living on borrowed time; it was only a matter of when, not if, they would fold.

===&quot;Brooklyn&quot; Americans===
At wit&#x27;s end, Dutton changed the team&#x27;s name for the 1941–42 season to the Brooklyn Americans. He intended to move the team to Brooklyn, but there was no arena in that borough suitable enough even for temporary use. As result, they continued to play their home games in Manhattan at Madison Square Garden while practicing in Brooklyn. They barely survived the season, finishing dead last for the second year in a row with a record of 16–29–3. After the season, the Amerks suspended operations for the war&#x27;s duration. In 1945, a group emerged willing to build a new arena in Brooklyn. However, in 1946, the NHL reneged on previous promises to reinstate the Amerks and canceled the franchise. Although Dutton had every intention of returning the Amerks to the ice after World War II, NHL records list the Amerks as having &quot;retired&quot; from the league in 1942.

===Legacy===
The NHL did not expand beyond its remaining six teams until the 1967–68 season. Dutton blamed the owners of Madison Square Garden (who also owned the Rangers) for pressuring the NHL to not reinstate the Americans. Dutton was so bitter that he purportedly swore the Rangers would never win a Stanley Cup again in his lifetime. This &quot;curse&quot; became reality; the Rangers did not win another Cup until 1994, seven years after his death.

The last active New York Americans player in the NHL was goaltender Chuck Rayner, who retired from the NHL in 1953, but played in minor and senior leagues for another three seasons, last with the Nelson Maple Leafs of the Western International Hockey League (WIHL). The last active Brooklyn Americans player was Ken Mosdell, who retired in 1959. Notably, former New York Americans defenseman Pat Egan played for the Jacksonville Rockets of the Eastern Hockey League (EHL) as a player-coach in the 1965–66 season.

The 1926–27 Americans team was the first team in professional sports history to have their surnames on the back of their uniform sweaters, along with numbers.

The New York metropolitan area did not have a second NHL team again until the establishment of the New York Islanders in nearby Uniondale, on Long Island, for the 1972–73 season. While the Americans attempted to relocate to Brooklyn in their final years, the Islanders did so, playing at the Barclays Center from 2015 to 2020, although unlike the Americans they continued to be known as the New York Islanders.

===Broadcasters===
The Americans&#x27; radio situation mirrored that of the New York Rangers: same stations, same broadcasters, same announcers; home games only, joined-in-progress. Jack Filman was the principal radio announcer for the Americans on and off until their demise.

A few Americans and Rangers games were on experimental TV stations in 1940–41 and 1941–42 seasons; then public television broadcasting closed down until 1945–46.

<text>A demigod is a part-human and part-divine offspring of a deity and a human, or a human or non-human creature that is accorded divine status after death, or someone who has attained the &quot;divine spark&quot; (divine illumination). An immortal demigod often has tutelary status and a religious cult following, while a mortal demigod is one who has fallen or died, but is popular as a legendary hero in various polytheistic religions. Figuratively, it is used to describe a person whose talents or abilities are so superlative that they appear to approach being divine.

==Etymology==

The English term &quot;god&quot; is a calque of the Latin word , &quot;half-god&quot;. The Roman poet Ovid probably coined &quot;semideus&quot; to refer to less important gods, such as dryads.
Compare the Greek &quot;hemitheos&quot;. The term demigod first appeared in English in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, when it was used to render the Greek and Roman concepts of and daemon. Since then, it has frequently been applied figuratively to people of extraordinary ability. 

==Classical==
In the ancient Greek and Roman world, the concept of a demigod did not have a consistent definition and associated terminology rarely appeared.

The earliest recorded use of the term occurs in texts attributed to the archaic Greek poets Homer and Hesiod. Both describe dead heroes as , or &quot;half gods&quot;. In these cases, the word did not literally mean that these figures had one parent who was divine and one who was mortal. Instead, those who demonstrated &quot;strength, power, good family, and good &quot; were termed heroes, and after death they could be called &quot;hemitheoi&quot;, a process that has been referred to as &quot;heroization&quot;. Pindar also used the term frequently as a synonym for &quot;hero&quot;.

According to the Roman author Cassius Dio, the Roman Senate declared Julius Caesar a demigod after his 46 BCE victory at Thapsus. However, Dio was writing in the third century CE — centuries after the death of Caesar — and modern critics have cast doubt on whether the Senate really did this.

The first Roman to employ the term &quot;demigod&quot; may have been the poet Ovid (17 or 18 CE), who used the Latin several times in reference to minor deities. The poet Lucan (39-65) also uses the term to speak of Pompey attaining divinity upon his death in 48 BCE. In later antiquity, the Roman writer Martianus Capella ( 410-420) proposed a hierarchy of gods as follows:

* the gods proper, or major gods
* the &quot;genii&quot; or daemones
* the demigods or &quot;semones&quot; (who dwell in the upper atmosphere)
* the &quot;manes&quot; and ghosts of heroes (who dwell in the lower atmosphere)
* the earth-dwelling gods like fauns and satyrs

==Celtic==

The Celtic warrior Cú Chulainn, a major protagonist in the Irish national epic the &quot;Táin Bo Cuailnge&quot;, ranks as a hero or as a demigod. He is the son of the Irish god Lugh and the mortal princess Deichtine.

In the immediate pre-Roman period, the Celtic Gallaceian tribe in Portugal made powerful, large stone statues of deified local heroes, which stood on hill forts in the mountainous regions of - what is today - Northern Portugal and Spanish Galicia.

==Hinduism==

In Hinduism, the term demigod is used to refer to deities who were once human and later became &quot;devas&quot; (gods). There are two notable demigods in Vedic Scriptures:

Nandi (the divine vehicle of Shiva), and Garuda (the divine vehicle of Vishnu). Examples of demigods worshiped in South India are Madurai Veeran and Karuppu Sami.

The heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, the five Pandava brothers and their half brother Karna, fit the Western definition of demigods though they are generally not referred to as such. Queen Kunti, the wife of King Pandu, was given a mantra that, when recited, meant that one of the gods would give her his child. When her husband was cursed to die if he ever engaged in sexual relations, Kunti used this mantra to provide her husband with children fathered by various deities. These children were Yudhishthira (child of Dharmaraj), Bhima (child of Vayu) and Arjuna (child of Indra). She taught this mantra to Madri, King Pandu&#x27;s other wife, and she immaculately conceived twin boys named Nakula and Sahadeva (children of the Ashvins). Queen Kunti had previously conceived another son, Karna, when she had tested the mantra out. Despite her protests, Surya the sun god was compelled by the mantra to impregnate her. Bhishma is another figures who fits the western definition of demigod, as he was the son of King Shantanu and Goddess Ganga.

The Vaishnavites (who often translate deva as &quot;demigod&quot;) cite various verses that speak of the devas&#x27; subordinate status. For example, the Rig Veda (1.22.20) reads, &quot;oṃ tad viṣṇoḥ paramam padam sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ&quot;, which translates to, &quot;All the suras [i.e., the devas] look always toward the feet of Lord Vishnu&quot;. Similarly, in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the concluding verses, read, &quot;The Rishis [great sages], the ancestors, the devas, the great elements, in fact, all things moving and unmoving constituting this universe, have originated from Narayana,&quot; (i.e., Vishnu). Thus the Devas are stated to be subordinate to Vishnu, or God.

A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) translates the Sanskrit word &quot;deva&quot; as &quot;demigod&quot; in his literature when the term referred to a God other than the Supreme Lord. This is because the Vaishnava tradition teaches that there is only one Supreme Lord and that all others are but His servants. In an effort to emphasize their subservience, Prabhupada uses the word &quot;demigod&quot; as a translation of &quot;deva&quot;. However, there are at least three occurrences in the eleventh chapter of Bhagavad-Gita where the word &quot;deva,&quot; used in reference to Lord Krishna, is translated as &quot;Lord&quot;. The word &quot;deva&quot; can be used to refer to the Supreme Lord, celestial beings, and saintly souls depending on the context. This is similar to the word &quot;Bhagavan&quot;, which is translated according to different contexts.

==China==

Among the demigods in Chinese mythology, Erlang Shen and Chen Xiang are most prominent. In the Journey to the West, the Jade Emperor&#x27;s younger sister Yaoji is mentioned to have descended to the mortal realm and given birth to a child named Yang Jian. He would eventually grow up to become a deity himself known as Erlang Shen.

Chen Xiang is nephew of Erlang Shen, birth by his younger sister Huayue Sanniang who married with a mortal scholar.

==Japan==
Abe no Seimei, a famous onmyōji from the Heian period was supposed to be one. His father, Abe no Yasuna (安倍 保名), was human. Still, his mother Kuzunoha, was a Kitsune, a divine fox, being this the origin of Abe no Seimei&#x27;s magical prowess.

==Anitism==

In the indigenous religions originating from the Philippines, collectively called Anitism, demigods abound in various ethnic stories. Many of these demigods equal major gods and goddesses in power and influence. Notable examples include Mayari, the Tagalog moon goddess who governs the world every night, Tala, the Tagalog star goddess, Hanan, the Tagalog morning goddess, Apo Anno, a Kankanaey demigod hero, Oryol, a Bicolano half-snake demi-goddess who brought peace to the land after defeating all beasts in Ibalon, Laon, a Hiligaynon demigod who can talk to animals and defeated the mad dragon at Mount Kanlaon, Ovug, an Ifugao thunder and lightning demigod who has separate animations in both the upper and earth worlds, Takyayen, a Tinguian demigod and son of the star goddess Gagayoma, and the three Suludnon demigod sons of Alunsina, namely Labaw Dongon, Humadapnon, and Dumalapdap.

<text>The Montreal Wanderers were an amateur, and later professional, ice hockey team based in Montreal. The team played in the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL), the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), the National Hockey Association (NHA) and briefly the National Hockey League (NHL). The Wanderers were four-time Stanley Cup winners. Prior to the formation of the NHL, the &quot;Redbands&quot; were one of the most successful teams in ice hockey.

==History==
James Strachan announced the formation of the new club on December 1, 1903. The team was founded on December 3, when club members met and selected their colours as red and white and named their officers – George Hodge as honorary president, Clarence D. McKerrow as honorary vice president, James Strachan as president, George Guile as vice president, and Tom J. Hodge as secretary.

The club had formed over a dispute over the control of the Montreal Hockey Club. Along with teams rejected for membership in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL), the team helped found the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL) on December 5. Many of the early Wanderers had been members of the 1902–03 Montreal Hockey Club team, which won the Stanley Cup. That team had been known as the &quot;Little Men of Iron&quot;, because of the players&#x27; tenacity and small stature, and the nickname carried over to the new club.
The Wanderers&#x27; first Stanley Cup challenge was played against the Ottawa Hockey Club on March 2, 1904, resulting in a 5–5 tie game. The Wanderers refused to continue the series unless the tie was replayed in Montreal, and forfeited the series. This was the start of a terrific rivalry as Ottawa and the Wanderers would split the championship between them from 1903 until 1911. Ottawa and the Wanderers would meet again in 1906, after a regular season tie for first place in the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), and played a two-game, total-goals series for the league championship and the Stanley Cup. The Wanderers won the first game in Montreal 9–1. The &quot;Silver Seven&quot; would storm back in the return match in Ottawa, with a 9–1 lead at one point in the game evening the total goals, but only won 9–3 as the Wanderers scored the last two goals, to win the series, and their first Stanley Cup.
Montreal defended the Stanley Cup in its first challenge as champions in December 1906. The Wanderers defeated the New Glasgow Cubs 17–5 in a two-game, total-goals series. They repeated as league champions in 1907, then faced the Kenora Thistles in a Stanley Cup challenge in January 1907. Kenora defeated Montreal 4–2 and 8–6, taking the trophy back to Northern Ontario. The Wanderers would regain the Stanley Cup from Kenora two months later in Winnipeg, defeating the Thistles 7–2 and 5–6.

The Wanderers won their third consecutive league title in 1907–08, while defending the Stanley Cup in a mid-season challenge by the Ottawa Victorias in January. After their third consecutive ECAHA title, the Wanderers were given its trophy, the Arena Cup permanently. The Arena Cup is on display in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto.

After the 1907–08 regular season, Montreal defended the Stanley Cup twice in March 1908, in challenges by the Winnipeg Maple Leafs, and the Toronto Professional Hockey Club. The 1907–08 Wanderers team scratched their names inside the bowl, which was just prior to the second band being added to the Cup. The team included five future honoured members of the Hockey Hall of Fame – Moose Johnson, Hod Stuart, Riley Hern, Lester Patrick, and Ernie Russell.

Before the 1909 season started, Montreal defended the Stanley Cup in a challenge by the Edmonton Hockey Club, winning 13–10 in two games. The Wanderers lost the Cup they had held for two years, finishing second place in the ECAHA to Ottawa.

===National Hockey Association===
The Wanderers were involved in the formation of the National Hockey Association (NHA). After the 1908 season, the Wanderers had been sold to P. J. Doran, owner of the Jubilee Rink, who now made plans to move the club from the Montreal Arena to the smaller Jubilee Rink for the 1910 season. This upset the other members of the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA), who would receive a smaller share of the proceeds from games played in the Wanderers rink. The other ECHA members suspended the ECHA and set up the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) league and rejected the application of the Wanderers to join. The Wanderers&#x27; representative at the meeting Jimmy Gardner met Ambrose O&#x27;Brien in the ground floor of the hotel where the league was meeting. Gardner suggested to O&#x27;Brien, who had been rejected in his application for the Renfrew Creamery Kings to join the ECHA, that they form a new league, including the Wanderers, Renfrew, the Cobalt Silver Kings and the Haileybury Hockey Club teams that O&#x27;Brien owned. O&#x27;Brien agreed and on December 4, 1909, the NHA was founded. Later in January 1910, the CHA folded and Ottawa and Montreal Shamrocks joined the NHA.

Doran sold the club to Eddie McCafferty, the secretary of the Montreal Royals minor league baseball team, owned by Sam Lichtenhein. McCafferty incorporated the Wanderers and sold shares of the club to the public. The majority of shares were bought by Lichtenhein, and he became president of the club&#x27;s corporation. The club moved back to the Montreal Arena.

The Wanderers regained the Stanley Cup in 1910, winning the 1910 championship of the new NHA and the new O&#x27;Brien Cup. The Wanderers successfully defended the Stanley Cup for the final time versus the Berlin Dutchmen in March 1910. Montreal fell to fourth place the following season, and lost the privilege to defend the Stanley Cup. The Wanderers would then miss the playoffs for four consecutive seasons. Montreal&#x27;s last winning season came in 1914–15, when they tied for first place and lost in a playoff series for the league championship. The Wanderers would win only 15 of their next 44 games in two seasons, before the NHA was reorganized as the National Hockey League (NHL).

===The NHL and the team&#x27;s demise===
The Wanderers played only four games in the NHL&#x27;s inaugural season and lost all but one game before their home rink, the Montreal Arena, burned down on January 2, 1918. At the time, they had lost star players Sprague Cleghorn and Odie Cleghorn and had appealed to the other teams for player help. Before the fire, they had successfully obtained goaltender Hap Holmes from the Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) and it seemed that they might turn around their misfortunes. After the fire, the Wanderers again appealed for reinforcements, but none were forthcoming. The team defaulted its next two games, against the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto, and then disbanded.

The last active Wanderers player was George Geran, who played his last NHL game in 1926. Dave Ritchie and Phil Stevens also played that season, but not the full year.

After the founding of the Montreal Canadiens, a team that specifically appealed to Montreal&#x27;s French-speaking community, the Wanderers drew their support from Montreal&#x27;s English-speaking community. A new team, the Montreal Maroons, was later established to take the Wanderers&#x27; place. The owners originally intended to use the name Wanderers, but were unable to obtain rights to the name. The Maroons, too, would eventually suspend operations in 1938, ending efforts to entrench separate Montreal-based teams for French- and English-speaking fans.

==Nickname==
The Wanderers; nickname was the namesake of several earlier Montreal teams. These teams each only lasted one year throughout the latter portion of the 19th century. The first had played in the Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournament in 1884. Another was an independent team that played various challenges in 1893. A third played in the Independent Amateur Hockey League in 1895, while a fourth played in the &quot;Cyclists Interclub Hockey League&quot; in 1897.

==Early Stanley Cup dominance==
The Wanderers were created in December 1903, played their first league game the following month, won their first league championship the next month, and challenged the Ottawa &quot;Silver Seven/Senators&quot; Hockey Club (HC) for the Stanley Cup on March 2, 1904.

While they lost that first challenge, it marked the start of a period of eight consecutive years through March 5, 1912, where these two teams would co-exist and either the Montreal Wanderers (1,390 days) or the Ottawa HC (1,474 days) would hold the Stanley Cup. Only the Kenora Thistles, for 61 days in 1907 (January 23 through March 25), would impinge on these two teams.

The Wanderers won or defended the Cup 10 times in their first seven years of existence, and lost only two direct challenges (to Ottawa in March 1904, and to Kenora in January 1907) during that period.

<text>The Revised Standard Version (RSV) is an English translation of the Bible published in 1952 by the Division of Christian Education of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA. This translation is a revision of the American Standard Version (ASV) of 1901, and was intended to be a readable and literally accurate modern English translation which aimed to &quot;preserve all that is best in the English Bible as it has been known and used through the centuries&quot; and &quot;to put the message of the Bible in simple, enduring words that are worthy to stand in the great Tyndale-King James tradition.&quot;

The RSV was the first translation of the Bible to make use of the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah, a development considered &quot;revolutionary&quot; in the academic field of biblical scholarship. The New Testament was first published in 1946, the Old Testament in 1952, and the Apocrypha in 1957; the New Testament was revised in 1971. The original &quot;Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition&quot; (RSV-CE) was published in 1965–66, and the deuterocanonical books were expanded in 1977. The &quot;Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition&quot; (RSV-2CE) was published in 2006.

In later years, the RSV served as the basis for two revisions—the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) of 1989, and the English Standard Version (ESV) of 2001.

== Publication and promotion ==
The immediate predecessor to the RSV was the American Standard Version (ASV), published in 1901 by Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons. It was copyrighted to protect the ASV text from unauthorized changes, and that copyright acquired by the International Council of Religious Education, one of the predecessor organizations to the National Council of Churches, which was formed in 1950. In 1928, the Council created a committee charged with creating a new translation based on the ASV, which was considered a somewhat weak and disappointing translation. Luther A. Weigle became its chair and helped find members; the final committee began meeting in 1937 at Yale Divinity School where they did their work.

A number of specially bound presentation copies were given to local public officials in the days prior to the general release. One such presentation copy, the very first copy of the RSV Bible to come off the press, was presented by Weigle to an appreciative President Harry S. Truman on September 26, four days before it was released to the general public.

On September 30, 1952, the RSV Bible was released to the general public. The NCC sponsored a celebratory rally in Washington D.C., with representatives of the churches affiliated with it present. A total of 3,418 interdenominational religious gatherings across North America were held that evening to honor the new version and the translators who made it possible.

== Features ==
There is a key similarity between the RSV and the KJV. &quot;&quot;Thou shall not kill&quot; - Commandment of GOD, Exodus 20:13&quot; and &quot;&quot;Do not kill&quot; - Matthew 5:21&quot; as opposed to &quot;Do not murder&quot;. 

There are four key differences between the RSV and its three direct predecessors (the KJV, RV and ASV):

# The translators reverted to the KJV and RV&#x27;s practice of translating the Tetragrammaton, or the Divine Name, YHWH. In accordance with the 1611 and 1885 versions, the RSV translated it as &quot; or &quot; (depending on whether the Hebrew of the particular verse was read &quot;Adonai&quot; or &quot;Elohim&quot; in Jewish practice), whereas the ASV had translated it &quot;Jehovah&quot;.
# A change was made in the usage of second-person pronouns. The KJV, RV and ASV use the pronouns &quot;thou&quot;, &quot;thee&quot;, &quot;thy&quot; and &quot;thine&quot; to translate all instances of the second-person singular in the original languages, alongside their associated verb forms (such as &quot;art&quot;, &quot;hast&quot;, &quot;hadst&quot; and &quot;didst&quot;). The pronoun &quot;you&quot; and its related forms are used in these translations only to translate the plural. In contrast, the RSV uses only the &quot;you&quot; forms regardless of number, retaining the older singular &quot;thou&quot; forms only in address to God (a fairly common practice for Bible translations until the 1970s).
# The RSV is the first direct revision of the KJV to significantly modernize the language used; for example, the verb ending &quot;-eth&quot; is replaced by the more contemporary &quot;-s&quot; to indicate the third-person singular present, some archaic past tense forms such as &quot;spake&quot; and &quot;sware&quot; are updated to their modern counterparts (&quot;spoke&quot; and &quot;swore&quot;), and the original case distinction between &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;you&quot; is removed (the latter being favoured in both nominative and objective cases).
# For the New Testament, the RSV followed the latest available version of Nestle&#x27;s Greek text, whereas the RV and ASV had used the Westcott and Hort Greek text, and the KJV had used the &quot;Textus receptus&quot;.

== Reception and controversy ==
=== Isaiah 7:14 dispute and impact ===
The RSV New Testament was well received, but reactions to the Old Testament were varied and not without controversy. Critics claimed that the RSV translators had translated the Old Testament from a non-Christian perspective. Some critics specifically referred to a Jewish viewpoint, pointing to agreements with the 1917 Jewish Publication Society of America Version Tanakh and the presence on the editorial board of a Jewish scholar, Harry Orlinsky. Such critics further claimed that other views, including those regarding the New Testament, were not considered. The focus of the controversy was the RSV&#x27;s translation of the Hebrew word (&quot;ʿalmāh&quot;) in Isaiah 7:14 as &quot;young woman.&quot;

&quot;Almah&quot; in Hebrew translates as a young woman of childbearing age who had not had children, and so may or may not be a virgin. The Greek language Septuagint written one hundred to three hundred years before Jesus rendered almah as &quot;parthenos&quot; (παρθένος), which translates as &quot;virgin&quot;, and this is the understanding carried over by Christians.

Of the seven appearances of &quot;ʿalmāh&quot;, the Septuagint translates only two of them as &quot;parthenos&quot;, &quot;virgin&quot; (including Isaiah 7:14). By contrast, the word (&quot;bəṯūlāh&quot;) appears some 50 times, and the Septuagint and English translations agree in understanding the word to mean &quot;virgin&quot; in almost every case.

The controversy stemming from this rendering helped reignite the King-James-Only Movement within the Independent Baptist and Pentecostal churches. Furthermore, many Christians have adopted what has come to be known as the &quot;Isaiah 7:14 litmus test&quot;, which entails checking that verse to determine whether or not a new translation can be trusted.

=== Protest ===
Some opponents of the RSV took their antagonism beyond condemnation. Luther Hux, a pastor in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, announced his intention to burn a copy of the RSV during a sermon on November 30, 1952. This was reported in the press and attracted shocked reactions, as well as a warning from the local fire chief. On the day in question, he delivered a two-hour sermon entitled &quot;The National Council Bible, the Master Stroke of Satan—One of the Devil&#x27;s Greatest Hoaxes&quot;. After ending the sermon, he led the congregation out of the church, gave each worshipper a small American flag and proceeded to set light to the pages containing Isaiah 7:14. Hux informed the gathered press that he did not burn the Bible, but simply the &quot;fraud&quot; that the Isaiah pages represented. Hux later wrote a tract against the RSV entitled &quot;Modernism&#x27;s Unholy Bible&quot;.

The RSV translators linked these events to the life of William Tyndale, an inspiration to them, explaining in their preface: &quot;He met bitter opposition. He was accused of willfully perverting the meaning of the Scriptures, and his New Testaments were ordered to be burned as &#x27;untrue translations.&#x27;&quot; But where Tyndale was strangled and then burned at the stake for his work, Bruce Metzger, referring to the pastor who burned the RSV and sent the ashes to Luther Weigle, commented in his book &quot;The Bible In Translation&quot;: &quot;today it is happily only a copy of the translation that meets such a fate&quot; instead of Bible translators.

== Post-1952 developments ==
=== Catholic Edition ===
In 1965–66, the Catholic Biblical Association adapted, under the editorship of John Archibald Henslowe Orchard O.S.B. and Reginald C. Fuller, the RSV for Catholic use with the release of the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSV-CE). A revised New Testament was published in 1965, followed by a full RSV Catholic Edition Bible in 1966. The RSV Catholic Edition included revisions up through 1962, a small number of new revisions to the New Testament, mostly to return to familiar phrases, and changes to a few footnotes. It contains the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament placed in the traditional order of the Vulgate.
=== Second Edition of the New Testament ===
Some of these changes to the RSV New Testament had already been introduced in the 1965-66 RSV Catholic Edition, and their introduction into the RSV itself was done to pave the way for the publication of the Common Bible in 1973.

The Standard Bible Committee intended to prepare a second edition of the Old Testament, but those plans were scrapped in 1974, when the National Council of Churches voted to authorize a full revision of the RSV.

=== Common Bible ===
The &quot;Common Bible&quot; of 1973 ordered the books in a way that pleased both Catholics and Protestants. It was divided into four sections: 
# The Old Testament (39 Books)
# The Catholic Deuterocanonical Books (12 Books)
# The additional Eastern Orthodox Deuterocanonical Books (three Books; six Books after 1977)
# The New Testament (27 Books)

=== Reader&#x27;s Digest Bible ===
In 1982, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; published a special edition of the RSV that was billed as a condensed edition of the text. A team of seven editors led by John Evangelist Walsh produced the manuscript. The &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; edition was intended for those who did not read the Bible or who read it infrequently; it was not intended as a replacement of the full RSV text. In this version, 55% of the Old Testament and 25% of the New Testament were cut. Familiar passages such as the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Psalm 23, and the Ten Commandments were retained. For those who wanted the full RSV, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; provided a list of publishers that sold the complete RSV at that time.

=== Second Catholic Edition ===
In early 2006, Ignatius Press released the &quot;Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition&quot; (RSV-2CE). This second edition removed archaic pronouns (&quot;thee&quot;, &quot;thou&quot;), and accompanying verb forms (&quot;didst&quot;, &quot;speakest&quot;), revised passages used in the lectionary according to the Vatican document &quot;Liturgiam authenticam&quot;, and elevated some passages out of the RSV footnotes when they favored Catholic renderings, such as replacing &quot;young woman&quot; with &quot;virgin&quot; in Isaiah 7:14.

== Revisions ==
=== New Revised Standard Version ===
In 1989, the National Council of Churches released a full-scale revision to the RSV called the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV). It was the first major version to use gender-neutral language and thus drew more criticism and ire from conservative Christians than did its 1952 predecessor. This criticism largely stemmed from concerns that the modified language obscured phrases in the Old Testament that could be read as messianic prophecies.

=== English Standard Version ===
In 2001, Crossway published the English Standard Version (ESV), its revision of the 1971 text edition of the RSV. In comparison to the RSV, the ESV reverts certain disputed passages to their prior rendering as found in the ASV. Unlike the NRSV, the ESV, depending on the context, prefers to use gender-inclusive language sparingly.

== Legacy and use today ==
When the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) was published in 1989, some traditional Christians — both Catholic and Protestant — criticized its wide use of gender-inclusive language. Because of its significance in the development of the English Bible tradition, many publishers and Biblical scholars continue to rely on the RSV tradition in their work, especially when writing for mixed Catholic and Protestant audiences:

Moreover, because of its importance to Anglican heritage and the English Bible tradition, the &quot;Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition&quot; (RSV-2CE) has been approved for liturgical use in Anglican Use Catholic parishes of the U.S. Pastoral Provision and Personal Ordinariates for former Anglicans around the world. The Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham in the United Kingdom has adopted the RSV-2CE as &quot;the sole lectionary authorized for use&quot; in its liturgies. The RSV is one of the versions authorized to be used in services of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion.

On January 20, 2017, incoming U.S. President Donald Trump took his inaugural oath of office using a copy of the RSV Bible given to him by his mother in 1955 when he graduated from a Presbyterian Sunday School.

== Documentary ==
In 1999, the National Council of Churches, in association with Odyssey Productions, produced a TV documentary about the making of the RSV — &quot;The Bible Under Fire&quot;.

<text>The Cleveland Barons were a professional American ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in Cleveland, Ohio, at Gund Arena between 2001 and 2006.

==History==

The team was named in honor of the popular Barons team that played in the AHL and its forerunners from 1929 to 1973 and the National Hockey League (NHL) team of the same name. The Barons name was revived in 2001 when the San Jose Sharks purchased their AHL affiliate, the Kentucky Thoroughblades, and relocated them to Cleveland, where they would play at the arena which was owned and operated by Sharks owners George and Gordon Gund. The Gunds had also owned the NHL Barons, who played in the NHL in the late 1970s before being merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978.

The franchise relocated to Worcester, Massachusetts, for the 2006–07 season and became the Worcester Sharks. Dan Gilbert, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), purchased the inactive Utah Grizzlies AHL franchise and moved it to Cleveland. Renamed the Lake Erie Monsters, the club resumed play in 2007 and then rebranded as the Cleveland Monsters in 2016.

The team logo, a shark holding a hockey stick, was originally designed as an alternate logo for the San Jose Sharks before being modified with a top hat, a monocle, and formal wear for the Barons.

<doc id="274470" wikidata="Q642399" url="?curid=274470" title="St. Louis Eagles">
<text>The St. Louis Eagles were a professional ice hockey team that played in the National Hockey League (NHL). Based in St. Louis, the Eagles played for only one year, the 1934–35 NHL season.

The team was founded in 1883 as the Ottawa Senators, a successful independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in 1917. From the mid-1920s onward, they endured financial strain caused, in part, by being in the NHL&#x27;s smallest market. The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season. Upon their return to play, having sold their better players in an effort to raise funds, the Senators finished in last place for two straight seasons and continued to lose money. Following the repeat last place finishes, the team decided that it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move to a bigger market.

In an attempt to recoup losses and pay outstanding debts, the Senators moved to St. Louis as the Eagles. However, the team continued to lose money because of increased travel expenses, and it was forced to sell players to other teams to meet its financial obligations.

After the season, the owners asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for a second time. This time, the NHL refused the request. Instead, the league bought back the franchise, halted its operations, and dispersed its players among the remaining teams.

==History==
===The move from Ottawa===

The Ottawa Senators were founded in 1883 as an amateur club. They began paying their players &quot;under the table&quot; in 1903 and turned openly professional in 1907. They were a charter member of the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917, and won the Stanley Cup four times in the NHL&#x27;s first decade (and seven times prior to the league&#x27;s formation – including their time as the Silver Seven).

However, for the better part of their tenure in Ottawa, the Senators played in the smallest market in the NHL. The 1931 census listed only 110,000 people in the city of Ottawa—roughly one-fifth the size of Toronto, the league&#x27;s second-smallest market. The team started having attendance problems when the NHL expanded to the United States in 1924; games against the new American teams did not draw well. Despite winning what would be its last Stanley Cup in 1927, the team lost $50,000 for the season. The Senators asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season in order to help eliminate debt. The league granted the request. During their suspended season, Ottawa received $25,000 for the use of its players, while the NHL co-signed a Bank of Montreal loan of $28,000 for the franchise. The Senators returned for the 1932–33 season and finished in last place. They finished last again in 1933–34 season. After the season, the Ottawa Auditorium, owners of the Senators, announced that the team would be moving elsewhere for the next season due to losses of $60,000 over the previous two seasons. Auditorium officials said they needed to move the Senators to a larger city in order to protect the shareholders and pay off their debts.

The Senators&#x27; owners decided to move the franchise to St. Louis, Missouri, and the transfer was approved by the league on May 14, 1934. Thomas Franklin Ahearn resigned as president of the Ottawa Auditorium and Redmond Quain became president. Quain transferred the players&#x27; contracts and franchise operations to a new company called the Hockey Association of St. Louis, Inc. Eddie Gerard was hired to coach the new team. The club was renamed the Eagles, inspired by the logo of the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, which was founded in St. Louis. The Senators name and logo remained in Ottawa and would be used by a senior amateur team until 1954. At the time, St. Louis was the seventh largest city in the United States, with over 800,000 inhabitants— over seven times larger than Ottawa. Despite this, St. Louis had been denied an NHL franchise in 1932 because travel to the Midwest was considered too expensive during the Great Depression.

Even before the debut of the Eagles, a problem had arisen for the new NHL club. There was already a professional hockey team in the city, the St. Louis Flyers, playing in the minor-pro American Hockey Association (AHA). The owners of the Flyers claimed they had an agreement with the NHL which prevented it from settling west of the Mississippi. They threatened to sue for $200,000 in compensation as soon as the Eagles played their first game. Following a visit from the AHA President, the Flyers were asked not to go forward with the lawsuit. The Flyers did not pursue further legal action and eventually changed their home arena.

===1934–35 season===

At the time there were nine teams in the NHL, divided into two divisions, the Canadian and American. Logically, the Eagles should have been placed in the American Division with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, New York Rangers and Detroit Red Wings. However, the Eagles retained the Senators&#x27; place in the Canadian Division alongside the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Maroons, and New York Americans. The core of the Senators&#x27; players returned and the team played their games in the St. Louis Arena. The arena was built in 1929 to host the National Dairy Show, but had suffered financially. In 1931, an ice hockey rink was set up to attract new business. Once the Eagles began play the St. Louis Arena gained the distinction of being the only NHL stadium with racially segregated seating.

In their first game the Eagles succumbed to a late rally by the defending Stanley Cup champion Black Hawks, losing 3–1. They registered their first win in the next game winning 4–2 over the Rangers. Following the win the Eagles went on an eight-game losing streak. After the first 13 games the Eagles posted a 2–11–0 record placing them last in their division. Gerard resigned as head coach and was replaced by George &quot;Buck&quot; Boucher, the coach that Gerard himself had replaced after the franchise&#x27;s last season in Ottawa.

Under Boucher&#x27;s coaching the team showed improvement, posting a 3–3–3 record in the first nine games. However, the early losing streak had already damaged the fan base. Their inaugural game drew 12,622 fans, but attendance quickly diminished. In early January 1935 the team cut ticket prices to the lowest in the league in an attempt to bring out fans. By February the financial state of the team forced the Eagles to essentially sell leading goal scorer Syd Howe to the Detroit Red Wings. Officially, the trade broke down as such - Detroit received Howe and Ralph Bowman in exchange for Teddy Graham and $50,000. At the time it was considered a large sum of money. Likewise Frank Finnigan was sold to the Maple Leafs. The Eagles were unable to maintain the early success under Boucher, and finished with the worst record in the league for the third year in a row, with a record of 11–31–6. With only 84 goals scored, they were the lowest scoring team in the league. Only the Montreal Canadiens allowed more goals during the season, surrendering 145 to the Eagles&#x27; 144.

===The end of the Eagles===

By season&#x27;s end the Eagles ownership had lost $70,000, due primarily to the cost of train travel. In those days, NHL teams traveled primarily by rail. Due to being in the Canadian Division, the Eagles had to make many trips to Montreal and Toronto. An attempt to stabilize the franchise by selling off some of its players netted $58,000. The owners had hoped to move again to save the franchise. There was interest from Cleveland and also in a return to Ottawa, but neither came to fruition.

As a result, the ownership again petitioned the NHL to allow them to suspend operations for a year. This time the NHL refused and the Eagles were put up for sale. After no credible offers surfaced, the NHL bought the franchise and player contracts for $40,000, and opted to play as an eight-team league. If the NHL ever resold the franchise, proceeds were to go to the Ottawa Hockey Association.
The NHL distributed the players under contract with St. Louis through a dispersal draft. Teams selected players in an order based on the previous season&#x27;s standings. Teams with the lowest point totals selected first. The Chicago Black Hawks did not participate in the draft. Eighteen of the 23 players under contract were selected with the remaining players being placed in the minor leagues. The players were distributed as follows:

* New York Americans: Forwards: Pete Kelly, Eddie Finnigan
* Montreal Canadiens: Goaltender: Bill Beveridge, Defenseman: Irv Frew, Forwards: Paul Drouin, Henri Lauzon
* Detroit Red Wings: Forward: Carl Voss, Goaltender: William Peterkin
* New York Rangers: Forward: Glen Brydson, Defenseman: Vernon Ayres
* Montreal Maroons: Forward: Joe Lamb, Goaltender: Bill Taugher
* Boston Bruins: Forward: Bill Cowley, Defenseman: Teddy Graham
* Toronto Maple Leafs: Forwards: Gerry Shannon, Cliff Purpur, Jim Dewey, Defenseman: Mickey Blake

No credible offers to purchase the dormant franchise ever surfaced. As a result, the Senators/Eagles franchise never took the ice again, and remain one of two NHL teams to fold after winning a Stanley Cup (the other being the Maroons).

In 1938, the Montreal Maroons attempted to move to St. Louis. They were denied by the NHL due to the high travel costs that plagued the Eagles. The NHL returned to St. Louis in 1967, when the league doubled in size from the Original Six. The new team was named the Blues and they joined the Minnesota North Stars, Los Angeles Kings, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins as part of the new expansion.

==Final standings==

==Players==
Twenty-nine players represented the Eagles during their lone season of existence. The last active player who played with the Eagles was Bill Cowley, who retired in 1947 after his final season with the Boston Bruins. He was also the only player in franchise history to start his career with the Eagles and be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Syd Howe was the only captain of the team during its existence and the two players were the only Eagles players to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Pete Kelly was the last surviving St. Louis Eagle, dying in 2004.

Carl Voss led the team with 18 assists and 31 points Howe led them in goalscoring registering 14, despite being traded midway through the season. The totals were much lower than the NHL leaders as Charlie Conacher of Toronto led the league with 36 goals and 57 points, while Art Chapman of the Americans led for assists notching 34. Bill Beveridge was the only goaltender the team used during the season. Out of his 11 wins three were shutouts.

The list of players in the history of the team is presented below.

<text>A gunboat is a naval watercraft designed for the express purpose of carrying one or more guns to bombard coastal targets, as opposed to those military craft designed for naval warfare, or for ferrying troops or supplies.

==History==
===Pre-steam era===
In the age of sail, a gunboat was usually a small undecked vessel carrying a single smoothbore cannon in the bow, or just two or three such cannons. A gunboat could carry one or two masts or be oar-powered only, but the single-masted version of about length was most typical. Some types of gunboats carried two cannon, or else mounted a number of swivel guns on the railings.

The small gunboat had advantages: if it only carried a single cannon, the boat could manoeuvre in shallow or restricted areas – such as rivers or lakes – where larger ships could sail only with difficulty. The gun that such boats carried could be quite heavy; a 32-pounder for instance. As such boats were cheap and quick to build, naval forces favoured swarm tactics: while a single hit from a frigate&#x27;s broadside would destroy a gunboat, a frigate facing a large squadron of gunboats could suffer serious damage before it could manage to sink them all. For example: during the 1808 Battle of Alvøen of the Gunboat War, five Dano-Norwegian gunboats disabled the British frigate . Gunboats used in the Battle of Valcour Island (1776) on Lake Champlain during the American Revolutionary War were mostly built on the spot, attesting to the speed of their construction.

Spanish admiral Antonio Barceló, experienced in the usage of small vessels in the conflicts against Barbary pirates, unveiled in 1781 a kind of small armored gunboat equipped with a heavy, long-range artillery piece. This originated the Spanish Royal Armada&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;fuerzas sutiles&quot;, which emphasized the usage of ships equipped with significant firepower but small enough to be difficult to hit back. His gunboats were first employed during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, obtaining great success in the otherwise failed siege, after which they were adopted by the Royal Armada.

All navies of the sailing era kept a number of gunboats on hand. Gunboats saw extensive use in the Baltic Sea during the late 18th century as they were well-suited for the extensive coastal skerries and archipelagoes of Sweden, Finland and Russia. The rivalry between Sweden and Russia, in particular, led to an intense expansion of gunboat fleets and the development of new gunboat types. The two countries clashed during the Russo-Swedish war of 1788–1790, a conflict that culminated in the massive Battle of Svensksund in 1790, in which over 30,000 men and hundreds of gunboats, galleys and other oared craft took part. The majority of these were vessels developed from the 1770s and onwards by the naval architect Fredrik Henrik af Chapman for the Swedish archipelago fleet. The designs, copied and refined by the rival Danish and Russian navies, spread to the Mediterranean and to the Black Sea.

Two variants occurred most commonly:
* a larger &quot;gun sloop&quot; (from the Swedish &quot;kanonslup&quot;) with two 24-pounder cannon, one in the stern and one in the bow
* a smaller &quot;gun yawl&quot; (&quot;kanonjolle&quot;) with a single 24-pounder cannon

Many of the Baltic navies kept gunboats in service well into the second half of the 19th century. British ships engaged larger Russian gunboats off Turku in southeast Finland in 1854 during the Crimean War. The Russian vessels had the distinction of being the last oared vessels of war in history to fire their guns in anger.

Gunboats played a key role in Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s plan for the invasion of England in 1804. Denmark-Norway used them heavily in the Gunboat War. Between 1803 and 1812 the United States Navy had a policy of basing its navy on coastal gunboats, experimenting with a variety of designs. President Thomas Jefferson (in office: 1801–1809) and his Democratic-Republican Party opposed a strong navy, regarding gunboats as adequate to defend the United States&#x27; major harbors. They proved useless against the British blockade during the War of 1812.

===Steam era===
With the introduction of steam power in the early 19th century, the Royal Navy and other navies built considerable numbers of small vessels propelled by side paddles and later by screws. Initially, these vessels retained full sailing rigs and used steam engines for auxiliary propulsion.

The British Royal Navy deployed two wooden paddle-gunboats in the Lower Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River during the Rebellions of 1837 in Upper and Lower Canada. The United States Navy deployed an iron-hulled paddle gunboat, , to the Great Lakes in 1844.

 became the first propeller-driven gunboat in the world. Conradi shipyards in Kiel built the steam-powered gunboat in 1849 for the small navy of Schleswig-Holstein. Initially called &quot;Gunboat No. 1&quot;, &quot;Von der Tann&quot; was the most modern ship in the navy. She participated successfully in the First Schleswig War of 1848–1851.

Britain built a large number of wooden screw-gunboats during the 1850s, some of which participated in the Crimean War (1853–1856), Second Opium War (1856–1860) and Indian Mutiny (1857–1859). The requirement for gunboats in the Crimean War was formulated in 1854 to allow the Royal Navy to bombard shore facilities in the Baltic. The first ships the Royal Navy built that met this requirement were the s. Then in mid-1854 the Royal Navy ordered six s followed later in the year by an order for 20 s. In May 1855 the Royal Navy deployed six &quot;Dapper&quot;-class gunboats in the Sea of Azov, where they repeatedly raided and destroyed stores around its coast. In June 1855 the Royal Navy reentered the Baltic with a total of 18 gunboats as part of a larger fleet. The gunboats attacked various coastal facilities, operating alongside larger British warships from which they drew supplies such as coal.

Gunboats experienced a revival during the American Civil War (1861–1865). Union and Confederate forces quickly converted existing passenger-carrying boats into armed sidewheel steamers. Later, some purpose-built boats, such as , joined the fray. They frequently mounted 12 or more guns, sometimes of rather large caliber, and usually carried some armor. At the same time, Britain&#x27;s gunboats from the Crimean War period were starting to wear out, so a new series of classes was ordered. Construction shifted from a purely wooden hull to an iron–teak composite.

In the later 19th century and early 20th century, &quot;gunboat&quot; was the common name for smaller armed vessels. These could be classified, from the smallest to the largest, into river gunboats, river monitors, coastal-defense gunboats (such as ), and full-fledged monitors for coastal bombardments. In the 1870s and 1880s, Britain took to building so-called &quot;flat-iron&quot; (or Rendel) gunboats for coastal defence.&lt;refsag162&gt;Preston (2007), pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; When there would be few opportunities to re-coal, vessels carrying a full sailing rig continued in use as gunboats; , a sloop preserved at Chatham Historic Dockyard in the United Kingdom, exemplifies this type of gunboat.

In the United States Navy, these boats had the hull classification symbol &quot;PG&quot;, which led to their being referred to as &quot;patrol gunboats&quot;. They usually displaced under , were about long, draught and sometimes much less, and mounted several guns of calibers up to . An important characteristic of these was the ability to operate in rivers, enabling them to reach inland targets in a way not otherwise possible before the development of aircraft. In this period the naval powers used gunboats for police actions in colonies or in weaker countries, for example in China (see e.g. Yangtze Patrol). This category of gunboat inspired the term &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot;. With the addition of torpedoes, they became &quot;torpedo gunboats&quot;, designated by the hull classification symbol &quot;PTG&quot; (Patrol Torpedo Gunboat).

In Britain, Admiral Fisher&#x27;s reforms in the 1900s saw the disposal of much of the gunboat fleet. A handful remained in service in various roles at the start of World War I in 1914. The last in active service were two of the second which survived until 1926, carrying out river patrols in west Africa.

In the circumstances of World War I (1914–1918), however, the Royal Navy re-equipped with small , shallow-draught gunboats (12 ships of the ) with sufficient speed to operate in fast-flowing rivers and with relatively heavy armament. During the war and in the post-war period, these were deployed in Romania on the Danube, in Mesopotamia on the Euphrates and Tigris, in northern Russia on the Northern Dvina, and in China on the Yangtze. In China, during anarchic and war conditions, they continued to protect British interests until World War II; other western Powers acted similarly.

More and larger gunboats were built in the late 1930s for the Far East. Some sailed there; others were transported in sections and reassembled at Shanghai.

===World War II===
====United Kingdom====
Most British gunboats were based initially in East Asia. When war with Japan broke out, many of these vessels withdrew to the Indian Ocean. Others were given to the Republic of China Navy (such as , which was renamed &quot;Ying Hao&quot;) and some were captured by the Japanese.

Some were later redeployed to the Mediterranean theatre and supported land operations during the North African campaign, as well as in parts of Southern Europe.

====United States====
In late 1941, the US Navy&#x27;s Yangtze Patrol boats based in China were withdrawn to the Philippines or scuttled. Following the US defeat in the Philippines, most of the remaining craft were scuttled. However, survived until being sunk in action during the Battle of Java in 1942.

====Soviet Union====
During the 1930s, the Soviet Navy began developing small armoured riverboats or &quot;riverine tanks&quot;: vessels displacing 26 to 48 tons, on which the turrets of tanks were mounted.

Three classes, numbering 210 vessels, saw service between 1934 and 1945:
* Project 1124: their standard armament was initially two turrets from T-28 or T-34 tanks, each mounting a 76.2 mm gun and Degtyaryov tank machine gun (DT), as well as two anti-aircraft machine guns – in some cases the rear turret was replaced with a &quot;Katyusha&quot; rocket-launcher
* : one T-28/T-34 turret with a 76.2 mm gun and DT, as well as four anti-aircraft machine guns
* &quot;S-40&quot;: one T-34 turret with a 76.2 mm gun and DT, as well as four anti-aircraft machine guns

With crews of 10 to 20 personnel, riverine tanks displaced 26 to 48 tons, had armour thick, and were long. They saw significant action in the Baltic and Black Seas between 1941 and 1945.

===Vietnam War===
US riverine gunboats in the Vietnam War, included Patrol Boats River (PBR), constructed of fiberglass; Patrol Craft Fast (PCF), commonly known as Swift Boats, built of aluminum; and Assault Support Patrol Boats (ASPB) built of steel. U.S. Coast Guard s supplemented these US Navy vessels. The ASPBs were commonly referred to as &quot;Alpha&quot; boats and primarily carried out mine-sweeping duties along the waterways, due to their all-steel construction. The ASPBs were the only US Navy riverine craft specifically designed and built for the Vietnam War. All of these boats were assigned to the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;Brownwater Navy&quot;.

<text>The War Office has referred to several British government organisations throughout history, all relating to the army. It was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between 1857 and 1964, at which point its functions were transferred to the new Ministry of Defence (MoD). It was equivalent to the Admiralty at that time, which was responsible for the Royal Navy (RN), and (much later) the Air Ministry, which oversaw the Royal Air Force (RAF). The name &#x27;Old War Office&#x27; is also given to the former home of the department, located at the junction of Horse Guards Avenue and Whitehall in central London. The landmark building was sold on 1 March 2016 by HM Government for more than £350 million, on a 250-year lease for conversion into a luxury hotel and residential apartments.

Prior to 1855, &#x27;War Office&#x27; signified the office of the Secretary at War. In the 17th and 18th centuries, a number of independent offices and individuals were responsible for various aspects of Army administration. The most important were the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, the Secretary at War, and the twin Secretaries of State; most of whose military responsibilities were passed to a new Secretary of State for War in 1794. Others who performed specialist functions were the controller of army accounts, the Army Medical Board, the Commissariat Department, the Board of General Officers, the Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces, the Commissary General of Muster, the Paymaster General of the forces, and (particularly with regard to the Militia) the Home Office.

The term War Department was initially used for the separate office of the Secretary of State for War; in 1855, the offices of Secretary at War and Secretary of State for War were merged, and thereafter the terms War Office and War Department were used somewhat interchangeably.

==History==
The War Office developed from the Council of War, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; grouping of the King and his senior military commanders which managed the Kingdom of England&#x27;s wars and campaigns. The management of the War Office was directed initially by the Secretary at War, whose role had originated during the reign of King Charles II as the secretary to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. In the latter part of the 17th century, the office of Commander-in-Chief was vacant for several periods, which left the Secretary at War answering directly to the Sovereign; and thereafter, even when the office of Commander-in-Chief was restored on a more permanent basis, the Secretary at War retained his independence.

The department of the Secretary at War was referred to as the &#x27;Warr Office&#x27; (sic) from as early as 1694; its foundation has traditionally been ascribed to William Blathwayt, who had accompanied King William III during the Nine Years&#x27; War and who, from his appointment as Secretary in 1684, had greatly expanded the remit of his office to cover general day-to-day administration of the Army.

After Blathwayt&#x27;s retirement in 1704, Secretary at War became a political office. In political terms, it was a fairly minor government job (despite retaining a continued right of access to the monarch) which dealt with the minutiae of administration, rather than grand strategy. The Secretary, who was usually a member of the House of Commons, routinely presented the House with the Army Estimates, and occasionally spoke on other military matters as required. In symbolic terms, he was seen as signifying parliamentary control over the Army. Issues of strategic policy during wartime were managed by the Northern and Southern Departments (the predecessors of today&#x27;s Foreign Office and Home Office).

From 1704 to 1855, the post of Secretary remained occupied by a minister of the second rank (although he was occasionally part of the Cabinet after 1794). Many of his responsibilities were transferred to the Secretary of State for War after the creation of that more senior post in 1794 (though the latter was also responsible for Britain&#x27;s colonies from 1801, and renamed Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, an arrangement which only ceased with the establishment of the Colonial Office in 1854).

From 1824, the British Empire (excepting India, which was administered separately by the East India Company and then the India Office) was divided by the War and Colonial Office into the following administrative departments:

NORTH AMERICA
* Upper Canada, Lower Canada
* New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island
* Bermuda, Newfoundland

WEST INDIES

MEDITERRANEAN AND AFRICA
* Malta
* Gibraltar
* Ionian Islands
* Sierra Leone and the West African Forts, Consulates to the Barbary States

EASTERN COLONIES
* New South Wales
* Van Dieman&#x27;s Land
* Ceylon
* Mauritius

The War Office, after 1854 and until the 1867 confederation of the &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot;, was to split the military administration of the British Empire much as the War and Colonial Office had:

In February 1855, the new Secretary of State for War was additionally commissioned as Secretary at War, thus giving the Secretary of State oversight of the War Office in addition to his own department. The same procedure was followed for each of his successors, until the office of Secretary at War was abolished altogether in 1863.

In 1855, the Board of Ordnance was abolished as a result of its perceived poor performance during the Crimean War. This powerful independent body, dating from the 15th century, had been directed by the Master-General of the Ordnance, usually a very senior military officer who (unlike the Secretary at War) was often a member of the Cabinet. The disastrous campaigns of the Crimean War resulted in the consolidation of all administrative duties in 1855 as subordinate to the Secretary of State for War, a Cabinet job. He was not, however, solely responsible for the Army; the Commander-in-Chief had a virtually equal degree of responsibility. This was reduced in theory by the reforms introduced by Edward Cardwell in 1870, which subordinated the Commander-in-Chief to the Secretary for War. In practice, however, a large influence was retained by the conservative Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Prince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge, who held the post between 1856 and 1895. His resistance to reform caused military efficiency to lag well behind that of Britain&#x27;s rivals, a problem that became obvious during the Second Boer War. The situation was only remedied in 1904, when the job of Commander-in-Chief was abolished, and replaced with that of the Chief of the General Staff, which was replaced by the job of Chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1908. An Army Council was created with a format similar to that of the Board of Admiralty, directed by the Secretary of State for War, and an Imperial General Staff was established to coordinate Army administration. The creation of the Army Council was recommended by the War Office (Reconstitution) Committee, and formally appointed by Letters Patent dated 8 February 1904, and by Royal Warrant dated 12 February 1904.

The management of the War Office was hampered by persistent disputes between the civilian and military parts of the organisation. The government of H.H. Asquith attempted to resolve this during the First World War by appointing Lord Kitchener as Secretary for War. During his tenure, the Imperial General Staff was virtually dismantled. Its role was replaced effectively by the Committee of Imperial Defence, which debated broader military issues.

The War Office decreased greatly in importance after the First World War, a fact illustrated by the drastic reductions of its staff numbers during the inter-war period. Its responsibilities and funding were also reduced. In 1936, the government of Stanley Baldwin appointed a Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, who was not part of the War Office. When Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, he bypassed the War Office altogether, and appointed himself Minister of Defence (though there was, curiously, no &quot;ministry&quot; of defence until 1947). Clement Attlee continued this arrangement when he came to power in 1945, but appointed a separate Minister of Defence for the first time in 1947. In 1964, the present form of the Ministry of Defence was established, unifying the War Office, Admiralty, and Air Ministry.

==The Old War Office building==
As early as 1718 letters from the Secretary at War were addressed from &quot;The War Office&quot;. His department had several headquarters in London until it settled at Horse Guards in Whitehall during 1722. It remained there until 1858. Then, following the dissolution of the Board of Ordnance, the War Office moved into the Board&#x27;s former offices in Cumberland House, Pall Mall. Over the ensuing years it expanded into adjacent properties on Pall Mall before it was relocated to purpose-built accommodation, in what is now known as the Old War Office Building, in 1906.

Between 1906 and its abolition in 1964 the War Office was based in a large neo-Baroque building designed by William Young, completed during 1906, and located on Horse Guards Avenue at its junction with Whitehall in Central London. The construction of the building required five years to complete, at a cost of more than 1.2 million pounds. The building is somewhat oddly shaped, forming a trapezoid in order to maximise the use of the irregularly shaped plot of land on which it was built: its four distinctive domes were designed as a decorative means of disguising the shape. It has around 1,100 rooms on seven floors.

After 1964 the building continued to be used, under the name The Old War Office, by the Ministry of Defence.

On 1 June 2007 the building, other than the steps that give access to it, was designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass on the building.

In August 2013 it was announced that the building would be sold on the open market, with a goal of realising offers above 100 million pounds. On 13 December 2014 the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the building would be sold to the Hinduja Group for an undisclosed amount. The building&#x27;s sale was completed on 1 March 2016 for more than 350 million pounds, on a 250-year lease, to the Hinduja Group (in partnership with OHL Developments) for conversion to a luxury hotel and residential apartments. The Hinduja Group and Raffles Hotels opened the hotel, named Raffles London at The OWO, in 2023.

<doc id="274475" wikidata="Q887539" url="?curid=274475" title="Board of Ordnance">
<text>The Board of Ordnance was a British government body. Established in the Tudor period, it had its headquarters in the Tower of London. Its primary responsibilities were &#x27;to act as custodian of the lands, depots and forts required for the defence of the realm and its overseas possessions, and as the supplier of munitions and equipment to both the Army and the Navy&#x27;. The Board also maintained and directed the Artillery and Engineer corps, which it founded in the 18th century. By the 19th century, the Board of Ordnance was second in size only to HM Treasury among government departments. The Board lasted until 1855, at which point (tarnished by poor performance in supplying the Army in Crimea) it was disbanded.

==Origins of the Board==
The introduction of gunpowder to Europe led to innovations in offensive weapons, such as cannon, and defences, such as fortifications. From the 1320s a member of the Royal Household, the &#x27;Keeper of the Privy Wardrobe in the Tower of London&#x27;, became increasingly responsible for the procurement, storage and distribution of weapons. His office and main arsenal were located in the White Tower. This &#x27;Privy Wardrobe in the Tower&#x27; grew, both in size and significance, after the start of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

During the following century, the influence of the Privy Wardrobe and its staff receded, and no new Keepers were appointed after 1476. In its place, a distinct Office of Ordnance began to establish itself at the Tower; this body was responsible for firearms and artillery, and was staffed in the 1460s by a Master, a Clerk and a Yeoman. In the 1540s, during the reign of Henry VIII, the Ordnance Office was expanded, with new officers appointed and their principal duties clarified.

In 1671, the Office of Ordnance took over the work of the Office of Armoury at the Tower; the Armoury had been a parallel body which was originally responsible for armour and edged weapons, but its activities had gradually widened over time, causing a degree of duplication. At this time, the Ordnance Office also began to conduct oversight of the nation&#x27;s forts and fortifications. In 1683, the board of management (first assembled in 1597) was formally constituted as the Board of Ordnance by Warrant of King Charles II; it consisted of five Principal Officers meeting under the chairmanship of the Master-General. At the same time it was given a new constitution (&#x27;Instructions&#x27;) by Lord Dartmouth, the Master-General. These detailed Instructions continued, with relatively little change, to provide the working framework for the Board and its officers until the early 19th century. The Board was a decision-making body, answerable to the Master-General who had power of veto. (He was also empowered to act independently of the Board). They were required to meet at least twice a week (8am every Tuesday and Thursday) at the Tower in order to transact business.

===Principal officers===
By the mid-16th century the Master was assisted by five &#x27;Principal Officers&#x27; who later went on to form the Board, which thus consisted of:

Two overseers:
*Master (later Master-General) of the Ordnance (head of the board and commander-in-chief of the corps)
*Lieutenant (later Lieutenant-General) of the Ordnance (deputy to the Master and second-in-command of the corps)
And four heads of department:
*Surveyor (later Surveyor-General) of the Ordnance (in charge of quality)
*Clerk of the Ordnance (in charge of purchasing)
*Storekeeper (later Principal Storekeeper) of the Ordnance (in charge of storage)
*Clerk of the Deliveries of the Ordnance (in charge of issuing)

The offices of Master of the Ordnance and Clerk of the Ordnance may be said to date from 1414, when Letters Patent were issued on behalf of Henry V of England to &#x27;Nicholas Merbury, Master of our Works, Engines, Cannons and other kinds of Ordnance for War, and to John Louth, Clerk of the same Works&#x27; (though it appears that these were appointments for service in the field of war rather than to a permanent position). Merbury was present at the Siege of Harfleur and (albeit without his guns) at the Battle of Agincourt. By 1450 Master of Ordnance was a permanent appointment, firmly based at the Tower of London.

The office of Yeoman of the Ordnance (established in 1430 to oversee both the storage of weapons and accoutrements and their delivery for use in the field) was abolished in 1543 and its duties were split between two new officers: the Storekeeper of the Ordnance and Clerk of the Deliveries. At the same time the office of Surveyor of the Ordnance was also established.

Until 1544 the Master had generally managed the day-to-day activities of the Ordnance Office. In that year, however, King Henry VIII appointed his brother-in-law Thomas Seymour as Master of the Ordnance, displacing the incumbent Sir Christopher Morris, who continued his previous work but with a new title: Lieutenant of the Ordnance. Thereafter the Lieutenant (or Lieutenant-General) had day-to-day oversight of the Board&#x27;s activities, while Master (or Master-General) had more the role of a statesman and supervisor (albeit still with specific responsibilities to the Board and its work).

From the 17th century through till 1828 the Master-General routinely had a seat in Cabinet, and thus served as &quot;de facto&quot; principal military adviser to the government. Some of the most illustrious soldiers of their generation served as Master-General: Marlborough, Cadogan, Cornwallis, Hastings, Wellington, Hardinge.

While the offices of Master-General and Lieutenant-General were almost always filled by prominent soldiers, the Ordnance Office was a largely civilian organisation up until the formation of its Artillery and Engineer corps in the early 18th century. Prior to 1716, civilians were generally employed as gunners and engineers by the Board; Storekeepers and their subordinates were also civilians (and remained so through till the Board&#x27;s demise in the 1850s) as were those engaged in manufacturing. Having established the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, however, the Board had parallel oversight of both a Military and a Civil Establishment. The Master-General was head of both Establishments; on a practical level, the Lieutenant-General had day-to-day oversight of the military personnel and the Surveyor-General oversaw the civil departments.

===Other personnel===
From its earliest years, the Ordnance Office was staffed by a large number of Clerks to manage its substantial administrative functions. A number of other officials reported to the board, including furbishers, proofmasters, keepers and fireworkers.

Two appointments stand out, as they (like the six Board members) were appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm: namely the Master Gunner of England and the Chief Engineer. These were the senior technicians on the staff. The appointment of Master Gunner was first made as early as 1485, though it ceased after the establishment of the Regiment of Artillery in the 18th century; that of Chief Engineer was instituted in 1660.

The Treasurer of the Ordnance was another important officer of the department, although he did not sit on the board. This office was instituted in 1670 (its duties having previously been discharged by the Lieutenant-General); the post was consolidated with several others in 1836 to form that of Paymaster General.

The Master of Naval Ordnance was a specific office established in 1546 who was assigned to the Council of the Marine and acted as a liaison between both boards.

The Board also had a network of officers in place in key forts, ordnance yards and other installations throughout the Realm (including overseas). The senior Ordnance officer in these locations was usually termed the Storekeeper, and he was responsible directly to the Board. Prior to the Union of the Crowns there was a Master of the Ordnance in the North (with oversight of Berwick, Newcastle and the nearby coastal forts) who had greater autonomy, though he was reliant on the London office for most supplies. Moreover, a Master of the Ordnance in Dublin oversaw a largely independent Irish Board of Ordnance until 1801.

===Coat of Arms===

The Arms of the Board of Ordnance first appeared in the seventeenth century, and were given royal approval in 1806, confirmed by a grant from the College of Arms in 1823. The blazon is as follows:
*Arms: Azure - 3 Field Pieces in pale, or; on a chief, argent, 3 cannonballs, proper.
*Crest: Out of a mural crown, argent, a dexter cubit arm, the hand grasping a thunderbolt, winged and inflamed, proper.
*Supporters: On either side a Cyclops, in the exterior hand of the dexter a Hammer, and in that of the sinister a pair of Forceps, resting on the shoulder of each respectively, all proper.
*Motto: &quot;sua tela tonanti&quot;. [&#x27;To the thunderer his weapons&#x27;; also more loosely translated as &#x27;To the warrior his arms&#x27;].

The old Board&#x27;s coat of arms is remembered today in the cap badge of the Royal Logistic Corps, which has the shield at its centre (it was previously used, along with the Board&#x27;s motto, by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps). The crest appears on the ensign of the Corps of Royal Engineers.

===Broad Arrow===

The broad arrow was the Board&#x27;s mark, used as such from the 17th century. Stamped on guns, papers, buildings and all kinds of equipment, it originally signified royal ownership. A proclamation of 1699 clarified its use on stores of war belonging to the Board of Ordnance; just over a hundred years later, in 1806, the Board directed its Storekeepers and others to mark &quot;all descriptions of Ordnance Stores ... with the broad arrow as soon as they shall have been received as fit for His Majesty&#x27;s Service&quot;.

===The &#x27;Ordnance Regiment&#x27;===
In the 16th century, the Constable of the Tower of London routinely exercised his right (as &quot;ex-officio&quot; Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets) to summon local citizens to form a garrison to guard the Tower; by the early 17th century this had been formalised into a standing militia. During the reign of Charles II, the Tower was still consistently being guarded by two garrison companies of militia. Then in 1685, following Charles&#x27;s death, the new King James II asked Lord Dartmouth (who was Constable of the Tower at the time, as well as Master-general of the Ordnance) to form a new Ordnance Regiment &#x27;for the care and protection of the cannon&#x27;: as well as guarding the stocks of guns, arms and ammunition in the Tower more effectively, it was envisaged that the new regiment would provide protection for the artillery trains, which were formed when necessary to deliver ordnance (e.g. to the battlefield at time of war). The old guard companies formed the core of this new regiment, but they were soon augmented by a further ten companies of 100 men each (again drafted from the Tower Hamlets); there was in addition a company of miners. The regiment was to be housed in the Grand Storehouse, then under construction in the Tower. As a precaution against the risk of igniting the Ordnance stores of gunpowder, it was equipped with modern flintlock fusils, rather than with the matchlock muskets borne by most other regular troops. As such, the King referred to it as &#x27;Our Royal Regiment of Fusiliers&#x27;. In its formative years, the regiment accompanied the royal artillery train to Hounslow Heath each summer (where the Army remained encamped for several weeks); there they guarded the guns, and the gunners and matrosses who had been drafted in to operate them. In due course, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Fusiliers ceased to be an Ordnance Regiment and became a regular Infantry regiment (the 7th Foot, later renamed the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)); but they continued to retain a base at the Tower. In 1949, the regimental depot (which had been located in Hounslow Barracks since 1873) returned to the Tower, to Waterloo Barracks (which had been built on the site of the old Grand Storehouse following a fire); it remained there for the next eleven years. Today, the Tower remains the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

==Activities==

===Storage and supply: the Ordnance Yards===
====Headquarters: the Tower of London====

In the medieval period, storage and supply of weapons and armaments was the responsibility of the King&#x27;s Wardrobe. Royal palaces (including the Tower of London) were therefore used for storage of armour, weapons and (in time) gunpowder. When the Office of Ordnance came into being, the Tower of London was already established as the main repository, and it remained the administrative centre of the new Board. Gunpowder was stored in the White Tower (and continued to be kept there until the mid-19th century). Small arms, ammunition, armour and other equipment were stored elsewhere within the Tower precinct, a succession of Storehouses and Armouries having been built for such purposes since the fourteenth century. From the mid-16th century bulkier items began to be stored in warehouses in the nearby Minories and cannons were proof-tested on the &#x27;Old Artillery Ground&#x27; to the north.

Within the Tower, the New Armouries of 1664 served the Board as a small arms store (it can still be seen today in the Inner Ward). The vast Grand Storehouse of 1692 served not just as a store, but also as a museum of ordnance, precursor to today&#x27;s Royal Armouries. (It was destroyed (along with its contents, some 60,000 objects) in a fire in 1841).

The Board&#x27;s administrative staff had expanded during the Napoleonic Wars to such an extent that in 1806 it purchased the lease of Cumberland House in Pall Mall and moved its main offices there, subsequently expanding into neighbouring properties. The Board itself also began to hold its meetings there, in preference to the Tower or Woolwich or other locations where it had previously been accustomed to meet. At the same time the Tower, though still technically the Board&#x27;s headquarters, was mostly given over to storage.

====Central store depots: Woolwich and Weedon====

In the mid-17th century the Board began to use land at Woolwich for storing and proving its guns. The land (known as The Warren) was purchased in 1671 and in 1682 a thousand cannons and ten thousand cannonballs were transferred to Woolwich from the Tower and the Minories. At the same time, the Old Artillery Ground was sold and the staff and equipment involved in proof testing moved to Woolwich. From 1688 all new ordnance items were ordered to be delivered to Woolwich rather than the Tower (thereafter the Tower continued to be used as the Board&#x27;s main repository for general stores).

The Woolwich Warren (later renamed the Royal Arsenal) continued to serve as Britain&#x27;s principal ordnance depot until the mid-twentieth century. It also developed into a major manufacturing site (see below).

During the Napoleonic Wars, concerns were expressed about the vulnerability of the nation&#x27;s ordnance stores to attack from the sea. One response was the establishment of a Royal Ordnance Depot at Weedon Bec, well away from the coast in Northamptonshire: a sizeable complex of storehouses and gunpowder magazines constructed along a waterway, it was connected to the Grand Union Canal to facilitate access and distribution. At the same time a similar (but short-lived) facility was also built alongside the Grand Junction Canal at North Hyde, west of London.

====Distribution points: the Royal Dockyards====
The Board established storage and maintenance areas close to the Royal Dockyards to enable easy transfer of guns, ammunition, powder, etc. on board ships (for use by the Navy at sea or for delivery to the Army in areas of conflict). They also provided ordnance supplies for the defensive fortifications of the Dockyard itself, and secure storage space for ships in port (Royal Naval ships returning from duties at sea were obliged to unload their stores of powder and ammunition; if a ship was to spend time &#x27;in ordinary&#x27; (i.e. out of commission) it had its guns removed as well).

In the 16th century the Ordnance Office had established &#x27;annexes&#x27; in Chatham, Deptford and Woolwich; others were to follow in the vicinity of the other major Dockyards. These facilities, generally known as Gun Wharves, developed into purpose-built Ordnance Yards in the course of the 18th century. Built alongside deep-water quays, they usually comprised an assortment of buildings for storage, administration blocks, workshops (for woodwork, paintwork and metalwork) together with accommodation for officers, usually built around a central Grand Storehouse (primarily used for gun carriages). Exterior courtyards were laid out for the storage of cannonballs.

The principal home Yards included: 

*HM Gun Wharf, Chatham
*Morice Yard, Devonport (replaced an earlier gun wharf just east of Mount Wise)
*Gunwharf, Portsmouth
*Gun Wharf, Sheerness
*Gun Wharf, Woolwich. (In the late 17th century Woolwich Gun Wharf expanded to the east, where it developed into the Royal Arsenal: a key Ordnance Board facility.)

Smaller Yards were built in parts of Britain to serve particular strategic purposes at particular times (such as the Yard in Great Yarmouth, built to service the fleet stationed in Yarmouth Roads during the Napoleonic Wars).
Ordnance Yards were also constructed in colonial ports overseas; like their counterparts in Britain, these were usually built in the vicinity of naval dockyards. Bermuda&#x27;s, begun in the 1830s, remains largely intact behind the dockyard fortifications; its magazines and storehouses are arranged around a small pool, where boats would arrive by way of a tunnel through the ramparts to be loaded with ammunition.

====Gunpowder storage====

For storage of gunpowder, a nearby fortified building was often used initially: the Square Tower at Portsmouth, the Citadel at Plymouth, Upnor Castle at Chatham; later, the Ordnance Board created purpose-built Gunpowder Magazines, often apart from the Yards, and at a safe distance from inhabited areas. There were also smaller magazines, supervised by Ordnance Board staff, at several fortified locations around the British Isles (from Star Castle on the Scilly Isles, to Fort George near Inverness).

The Tower of London remained the main, central repository until 1694, when a new gunpowder depot was established on the banks of the Thames at Greenwich Peninsula. The location was chosen both for reasons of safety (it was largely uninhabited marshland) and for convenience (because gunpowder barrels were invariably delivered by boat). The powder arrived at Greenwich from the manufacturers. Once there it was not only stored, prior to being despatched to wherever it might be needed, but a sample from each batch was proof tested. This took place in one of a pair of smaller buildings alongside and linked to the main magazine (which was a windowless quadrangle).
Very soon, however, the Board was coming under pressure from local residents to remove the gunpowder store from Greenwich. Eventually, in 1763, a new set of magazines were built, along with a new proof-house, further downriver at Purfleet. Named the Royal Gunpowder Magazine, it was likewise used as a central store, to receive and approve gunpowder from the manufacturers prior to distribution around the country. (Soon afterwards the Greenwich magazine closed, and it was later demolished.)

At around the same time, significant improvements were made to the gunpowder depots at the Dockyards (where the Board was still often using old buildings in built-up areas). New purpose-built storage facilities were constructed close to the principal Dockyards at Portsmouth (Priddy&#x27;s Hard) and Devonport (Keyham Point), and at Chatham the Upnor facility was (eventually) expanded. These centres continued to grow, as the processes for refining and preserving gunpowder became more complicated and as new explosives began to be used, requiring their own storage and maintenance areas.

In 1850, Devonport&#x27;s magazine depot was moved from Keyham to a new complex at Bull Point (where it was integrated with a nearby proofing and purifying facility) - this proved to be the last major construction project of the Board of Ordnance before its disestablishment.

====Other items====
The Board of Ordnance was responsible, throughout its existence, for supplying the Army and Navy with weapons and ammunition. Other items were provided by various other boards and agencies (or, in earlier times, by private contractors). From 1822, however, the Board was given responsibility for sourcing, storing and supplying a variety of other items for the Army, including tents and camp equipment (formerly the remit of the Army&#x27;s Storekeeper-General) and &#x27;barrack stores&#x27; (for which the Commissariat had been responsible since 1807). Later, in 1834, the Board inherited (also from the Commissariat) the task of providing food and &#x27;fuel&#x27; (namely coal and candles for use in barracks) for all homeland troops, as well as forage for cavalry regiments.

===Manufacture: the Ordnance Factories===
Prior to the 18th century the Board had generally relied on private contracts for the provision of armaments: small arms often came from the Birmingham Gun Quarter, gunpowder from Faversham (also, later, from Waltham Abbey). Cannons and shot were procured from iron foundries (initially those in the Kent and Sussex Weald, later from further afield, e.g. from the Carron Works in Falkirk). More expensive &#x27;brass&#x27; (bronze) ordnance was produced on a smaller scale, by specialist foundries mostly in the London area (in Houndsditch, Vauxhall, Southwark, at The Foundery in Moorfields and elsewhere). In time, the Board made moves to set up or purchase its own facilities.

====Artillery manufacture====

The Board&#x27;s primary manufacturing site, and a key location for several of its activities, was the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. Guns had been stored and proved there from the mid-17th century. It later expanded into a large-scale production facility, specializing in: 
* manufacture of shells, projectiles and propellants (Royal Laboratory, established at Woolwich in 1695, previously based at Greenwich)
* manufacture of cannons, mortars and other artillery pieces (Royal Brass Foundry (aka Gun Factory), founded 1717)
* manufacture of gun carriages and other ancillary items (1750s onwards; given identity as the Royal Carriage Works in 1803).

====Gunpowder manufacture====
Gunpowder manufacture was mostly kept separate of other operations (though some took place at Woolwich in the early years, inherited from the Wardrobe&#x27;s earlier activities at Greenwich Palace). Beginning in the 18th century, the Board began to purchase mills that had been established under private ownership:
*Faversham became the Royal Powder Mill in 1759
*Waltham Abbey became the Royal Gunpowder Factory in 1787
*In Ireland, the Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills were purchased in 1805, having been set up as a private enterprise ten years earlier.
Ordnance Board activity at Ballincollig ceased in 1815; both it and Faversham were returned to private ownership in the 1820s-30s, but Waltham Abbey remained in Government hands until 1991.

====Small Arms manufacture====
Small arms manufacture was begun by the Board on Tower Wharf in 1804, before being moved to Lewisham (Royal Manufactory of Small Arms, 1807) and then transferring ten years later to Enfield (Royal Small Arms Factory, opened 1816). RSAF Enfield continued manufacturing until its closure in 1988.
There is some indication that William Galloway, a gunsmith, produced long guns for the Tower&#x27;s small arms office in the 1780s.

===Forts and fortifications===

From the mid-17th century the Board of Ordnance began to be involved in the design, building and upkeep of forts, fortifications and various garrison buildings. Around the year 1635, a Francis Coningsby was appointed &#x27;Commissary-General of all His Majesty&#x27;s Castles in England and Wales&#x27;. From 1660 the title was Engineer-in-Chief. The Chief Engineer had responsibility for drawing up designs, supervising site surveys and building works, and visiting established defence sites to evaluate their state of repair, readiness etc. An illustrious holder of this post was Sir Bernard de Gomme. In 1802 the post of Inspector General of Fortifications was established, and this official took over supervision of these works.

====Barracks====

The Board also had responsibility for the building, upkeep and management of barracks and associated structures (except during a 30-year period, 1792-1822, when responsibility was transferred to a separate Barrack Office). Before this time, barracks were a rarity in mainland Britain and (other than those attached to royal residences) they were generally only found within garrisoned fortifications. In the wake of the French Revolution, however, there was a spate of barrack building and the new post of Barrackmaster-General was established to oversee it; he was answerable not to the Board of Ordnance but to the Secretary at War. (The Board, though, retained responsibility for providing and provisioning barracks for its own corps). Apparent mismanagement in the Barrack Office led to a series of inquiries, however, and following the Napoleonic Wars responsibility for barracks was returned to the Board of Ordnance.

===Personnel: the Ordnance Corps===
A number of different Corps were established by the Board of Ordnance to carry out its work both in its home establishments and on the field of battle; they had (and to some extent retain) a very distinctive identity and ethos. Principal among these were the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers. These Corps were under the authority of the Board of Ordnance, rather than the War Office (until the Board&#x27;s demise in 1855). They were not part of the Army, and their officers&#x27; commissions were issued by the Master-General of the Ordnance rather than by the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. The Ordnance Medical Department was established to provide surgeons for these corps.

====Royal Artillery====
In 1716 the Duke of Marlborough, in his capacity as Master General of the Ordnance, oversaw the formation (by Royal Warrant) of two permanent companies of field artillery, based (together with their guns) at the Warren (Royal Arsenal), Woolwich. Prior to this, artillery pieces had been conveyed to the front line in any conflict by &quot;ad hoc&quot; artillery trains (their personnel convened for a limited duration by Royal Warrant). The men of the new artillery companies (which became the Royal Regiment of Artillery from 1722) now provided troops for this purpose; before long, they were also providing guns and heavy artillery for forts and garrisons around the country and indeed across the Empire. In addition, the Artillerymen did on-site work at the Arsenal and at other Ordnance Board facilities, from preparing fuses and proving weapons to providing a guard. 1793 saw the formation of the Royal Horse Artillery (who were likewise under the authority of the Board of Ordnance) to provide artillery support to the Cavalry.

====Royal Engineers====
From the start, the Board (and its predecessor the Office) of Ordnance had had a department of military engineers and surveyors to build and improve harbours, forts and other fortifications. In 1716 a Corps of Engineers was founded by the Board of Ordnance, again at their Woolwich base. Initially an officer-only corps, the Engineers (called Royal Engineers from 1787) were engaged in the design, construction and ongoing maintenance of defences, fortifications and other military installations. They were also engaged for large-scale civilian projects from time to time. A civilian corps of &#x27;artificers&#x27; provided the non-commissioned workforce of carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers and other labourers; this corps was militarized in 1787, and named the Royal Military Artificers (they were then renamed the Royal Sappers and Miners 25 years later). The year after the demise of the Ordnance Board, the Sappers and Miners were fully amalgamated into the Royal Engineers, and at the same time the Corps moved from Woolwich to its present headquarters in Chatham.

====Other corps====
A Field Train Department was established in 1792 to serve as &#x27;the field force element of the Board of Ordnance Storekeeping system&#x27;; staffed by uniformed civilians, the Department had oversight of the supply and provision of small arms, ammunition and other armaments to all front-line troops. After the Board&#x27;s demise, the Ordnance Field Train was consolidated, together with the Ordnance Storekeepers and others, into a new Military Store Department, which eventually formed a key part of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.

In 1796 a Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers was raised (separate from the Royal Artillery itself) to provide horses and drivers for conveying the field guns from place to place. (Before this time civilian drivers were used and horses either requisitioned or hired on contract). In 1822 the Corps of Drivers was fully amalgamated into the Royal Artillery.

The Corps of Royal Military Surveyors and Draftsmen was a military corps under the Board of Ordnance, formally established in 1800 and disbanded in 1817. It supported the work of the Ordnance Survey; after 1824 these duties were undertaken by Survey Companies of the Royal Corps of Sappers and Miners. Both corps were overseen by officers of the Royal Engineers in this work.

The Ordnance Medical Department was formed in 1801 (prior to this date medical officers were included on the establishment of the Royal Artillery). It was overseen by the Inspector General of Ordnance Hospitals, based at the Royal Artillery Hospital, Woolwich, who made recommendation for the appointment and promotion of medical officers, issued them with instructions and guidance, and had oversight of the management of Artillery Hospitals (of which there were eighteen Great Britain in 1810, and others in Ireland). Initially set up as &#x27;the Medical Establishment for the Military Department of the Ordnance&#x27;, its remit was extended to cover &#x27;the Military and Civil Departments of the Ordnance&#x27; in 1814. In 1853 it was merged into the Army Medical Department.

In 1796 Edward Coleman was appointed Veterinary Surgeon to the Board of Ordnance. He oversaw the training and appointment of more veterinary surgeons to provide for the needs of Artillery and Engineer horses; and in 1805 he supervised the setting up of a Veterinary Establishment in Woolwich (later named the Royal Horse Infirmary) which functioned as a hospital, veterinary store and centre of veterinary research. After the Crimean War, it became &quot;de facto&quot; headquarters of the emergent Army Veterinary Department.

===Education and training===

The Board of Ordnance placed a high value on providing its future officers with a scientific and military education. In the eighteenth century there was no requirement for would-be Army officers to receive any formal military education; but the Board, in contrast, moved fast (after the establishment of its artillery and engineer corps) to provide for the education of its officer cadets. The Board was also ahead of the Army in its provision of advanced training for officers.

====The Royal Military Academy====
In 1720 there were moves to set up an &#x27;academy&#x27; within the Warren at Woolwich where the corps were based; and on 30 April 1741 the Academy was formally established there by Royal Warrant. The fact that the Warren itself was a place of scientific experiment and innovation no doubt helped form the style of education that emerged. Initially, it was a gathering of &#x27;gentlemen cadets&#x27;, brought together to learn &#x27;gunnery, fortification, mathematics and a little French&#x27;. By 1764, the institution had been renamed the Royal Military Academy, and in the words of the Survey of London, &#x27;it became a uniquely enlightened establishment in which training comprehended writing, arithmetic, algebra, Latin, French, mathematics, fortification, together with the attack and defence of fortified places, gunnery, mining and laboratory-works [...] along with the gentlemanly skills of dancing and fencing&#x27;. In time, the Academy outgrew its original home in the Arsenal, and in 1806 it moved into new headquarters on Woolwich Common. In 1946 it amalgamated with the Royal Military College to form the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

====Specialist training====

The Royal Military Repository was established, also within the Warren, in 1778 to provide practical, theoretical and historical training in gunnery, both for officers and other ranks; it too moved to Woolwich Common in the early 19th century. The Royal Engineer Establishment was established by the Board in Chatham in 1812, to provide advanced training for its Engineer officers; it was subsequently renamed the School of Military Engineering.

===Other activities===

====Mapmaking: the Ordnance Survey====
As part of its duty of maintaining and building harbours and fortifications, a department of the Board was in place to undertake surveys and to produce maps. This department developed into the Ordnance Survey, which remains in place today as Britain&#x27;s national mapping agency. The principal offices and drawing room of the Survey were in the Tower of London; this not only accommodated surveyors and draughtsmen, but also functioned as a place where cadets (some as young as eleven or twelve) were trained in mathematics and draughtsmanship by leading practitioners. In 1841 a fire prompted the Survey to move to new premises in Southampton; following the demise of the Board, it became part of the War Department.

====The Geological Survey====
The Ordnance Geological Survey, the world&#x27;s first national geological survey, was established by the board in 1835; ten years later, under the terms of the Geological Survey Act 1845 
(8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 63), responsibility for the survey passed from the Board to the Office of Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works and Buildings. Known since 1984 as the British Geological Survey, it remains active as a national research and advisory body.

====The Global Magnetic Survey====

In 1839 the government gave its support to Major (later Sir) Edward Sabine for the establishment of four fixed magnetic and meteorological observatories in different parts of the world: one in Hobarton, one in Cape Town, one on Saint Helena, one in Toronto. The first would be overseen by Admiralty, staffed by officers of the Ross expedition; the other three were to be staffed by Artillery officers, under the authority of the Board of Ordnance. Sabine&#x27;s intention was to undertake a global survey of terrestrial magnetism. Once the observatories were established, measurements were taken every two hours, day and night, at precisely the same moment in all four stations; the results were then conveyed to Sabine at his Magnetic Office in the Royal Artillery Institution Observatory at Woolwich. Measurements continued for three years at Hobarton, six years at Cape Town and Saint Helena, and nine years at Toronto. After this, the observatories (apart from Saint Helena&#x27;s, which was dismantled) were handed over to the respective local governments; that in Toronto went on to becoming the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory. In England, Sabine maintained his Magnetic Office at the observatory in Woolwich until 1871, when it moved to Kew Observatory.

====The Royal Observatory, Greenwich====
In 1675, the post of Astronomer Royal was established by royal warrant. The Board of Ordnance was warranted to pay the astronomer&#x27;s salary, and also to construct a Royal Observatory in Greenwich. This has been called the first instance of government funding for science; money was to be provided from &#x27;the sale of old or decayed gunpowder&#x27;. The Board of Ordnance continued to provide annual funding for the observatory until 1818, when the Admiralty took over this responsibility. Despite providing funds, the board was not in any way involved in the operational side of the observatory, which was managed independently by the Astronomer Royal under the governance of a board of visitors.

==Demise==
By the Ordnance Board Transfer Act 1855 (18 &amp; 19 Vict. c. 117), the &#x27;powers, authorities, rights and privileges&#x27; formerly vested in the Principal Officers of the Ordnance were transferred to &#x27;Her Majesty&#x27;s Principal Secretary of State for the War Department&#x27;. With this came responsibility for stores, land, contracts, surveys, defensive works and manufacturing, along with all their various associated personnel. The board&#x27;s former offices in Pall Mall now became the headquarters of a newly-reconstituted and greatly-expanded War Office. The patents of the Master General, the Lieutenant-General and the Principal Storekeeper of the Ordnance were all revoked; and command of the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers was transferred, from the Master General of the Ordnance to the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces; both corps thenceforward became an integrated part of the British Army.

===Background===
The catalyst for the board&#x27;s disestablishment was the Crimean War. &#x27;Disastrous logistical difficulties&#x27; plagued the campaign, especially during the Russian winter of 1854. These widely-reported failings led to the fall of the government in January 1855; its successor, under Lord Palmerston, wasted no time in embarking on a comprehensive reorganisation of military administration.

Well before Crimea, however, there had been moves afoot to reduce the board&#x27;s sizeable influence and power. In 1830, the number of Principal Officers of the Ordnance had been reduced to four by the abolition of the posts of Lieutenant-General and Clerk of the Deliveries; arguably, this exacerbated the problems that led to the board&#x27;s demise. Then, in 1833, a parliamentary Commission of Enquiry was set up to look into consolidating the civil departments of the Army and the Ordnance (another commission was set up with similar terms of reference two years later) but its recommendations were not carried through.

The causes of the logistical failings in Crimea were complex and remain the subject of some debate. Management of the British Army in the 1850s was chaotic, unwieldy and inefficient, with several different officials and establishments claiming and exercising the Sovereign&#x27;s authority in relation to military matters, and no means of co-ordinating their functions, orders and activities. Furthermore, following forty years of relative peace, the army and its support services found themselves ill-prepared and ill-equipped for war: for example, responsibility for providing food, fuel and forage to troops overseas fell to the Commissariat (a branch of the Treasury which, in the years since Waterloo, had developed into an administrative division, unpractised in warfare); while the Army&#x27;s land transport capability, the Royal Waggon Train, had been abolished as a cost-cutting measure in 1832.

At the time, much of the blame for failure fell on Field Marshal Lord Raglan, commander-in-chief of the British army in Crimea (who, ironically, died of dysentery there on 29 June 1855 at a time when his forces were afflicted with cholera and reeling from a disastrous series of military failures.):(In 1855) . . .&quot; a loud outcry against Lord Raglan had begun in the press. He was charged with neglecting to see to the actual state of his troops, and to the necessary measures for their relief. Their condition was becoming more and more pitiable; their numbers dwindling rapidly from death and disease. The road between Balaclava and the camp had become a muddy quagmire, the few remaining horses of our cavalry were rapidly disappearing, every day the difficulty of getting up food and other necessaries from Balaclava was becoming more serious, and still no provision was being made for supplying an effective means of transport.&quot;

As well as commanding the army in Crimea, Lord Raglan also held the office of Master-General of the Ordnance at the time; his removal from the UK at the outbreak of war left a void in leadership at the head of the Board of Ordnance (which was compounded by the absence of the Surveyor-General of the Ordnance, who also went to Crimea). The post of Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance was therefore belatedly revived to try to fill the gaps, but its duties were left ill-defined.

Nevertheless, the Commander-in-Chief Lord Hardinge spoke positively of the board&#x27;s contribution in his evidence to the 1855 Parliamentary Committee into the conduct of the Crimean War: &quot;The Board of Ordnance had met the military difficulties of the situation with determination and success. Starting with the advantage of a well-trained and excellent personnel and reliable and sufficient materiel, they had faced the terrible losses of the winter of 1854 with resource and energy, and had lost no time in correcting the blunder of the absence of siege transport. Men and horses were quickly obtained and sent to the front, and, though every mistake in war demands an inevitable penalty, the military organisation did not fail under the heavy strain placed upon it. Nothing could exceed the military arrangements of the Ordnance Department.&quot;

Ultimately, the war in Crimea revealed failings across multiple departments compounded by confused structures of command and control; and the disestablishment of the Board of Ordnance became one of a series of wide-ranging military reforms which took place in the UK over the next half century.

===Aftermath===
Under the Secretary of State for War, a new Under Secretary was appointed in 1856 to take over the duties of the Clerk of the Ordnance (the one remaining Principal Officer, who had retained oversight of the board&#x27;s civil staff in the interim following its disestablishment). Several directorates were formed: there was a Director General of Stores (successor to the old Principal Storekeeper, with responsibility also for barracks), a Director General of Contracts and a number of technical advisers: the Inspector General of Fortifications, Director General of Naval Artillery and Director General, Royal Artillery. In 1857, the network of Storekeepers and Clerks across various locations was reconstituted to form the Military Store Department. The Field Train remained operational alongside the Military Store Department for a short time, before being merged into it on 27 September 1859.

In Britain there was a longstanding (and at this time still lingering) suspicion of the idea of a standing army; so, although the Board of Ordnance troops (the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers) were merged into the Army and placed under the Commander-in-Chief, the Military Store Department (with its sizeable stocks of armaments and ammunition) remained under the civil oversight of the Secretary of State. Subsequently a series of organisational changes took place in an attempt to consolidate the various departments and responsibilities formerly pertaining to the Board of Ordnance, along with those of the Commissariat (which had likewise been absorbed by the War Office in 1855); this led in time to their amalgamation as part of the short-lived Control Department, before re-emerging as the Ordnance Store Department and the Commissariat and Transport Department (both of which evolved into military units in due course).

===Ordnance Board in the twentieth century===
Some fifty years after the old board&#x27;s disestablishment, following unease after the Second Boer War that the British Army had been ill-equipped, a new body called the Ordnance Board was created within the War Office. It consisted of a committee of munitions experts, whose purpose was to advise the newly-formed Army Council on the safety and approval of weapons.

The new board had its origins in the Select Committee of Artillery Officers, formed by the old Board of Ordnance in 1805 &#x27;to assist in forming opinions on any inventions and suggestions of individuals, as likewise all improvements that may be proposed for the improvement of the Artillery Service&#x27;. After the demise of the Board of Ordnance, the Secretary of State for War revised and reconstituted the Ordnance Select Committee (this time including Naval representation). It continued to receive, report on and experiment with inventions or improvements submitted to the Secretary of State relating to arms and to gunpowder until 1869, when it was split into ten sub-committees overseen by a Council of Ordnance (an arrangement which caused confusion, and which fell into abeyance the following year in all but name).

In 1881 the &#x27;Ordnance Committee&#x27; was re-formed, with an extended remit to approve designs for manufacture, in addition to considering inventions and conducting experiments. It was renamed the &#x27;Ordnance Board&#x27; in 1908, having merged with the Ordnance Research Board. Further amalgamations prompted further name-changes: back to the &#x27;Ordnance Committee&#x27; in 1915, (after which, for the duration of the First World War, it formed part of the Ministry of Munitions), and back again to the &#x27;Ordnance Board&#x27; in 1939 (after which, for the duration of the Second World War, it formed part of the Ministry of Supply).

Up until 1939, the Ordnance Board (like the Ordnance Select Committee before it) was based at the Royal Arsenal, in Verbruggen House. The board worked closely with the Proof and Experimental Establishment, the Research Department and the Design Department (which later amalgamated to form the Armament Research and Development Establishment) all of which were likewise based at the Royal Arsenal until 1939; it also had close links to the Inspection (or Quality Assurance) Department, which remained at the Arsenal into the 1990s.

At the outbreak of war, the Ordnance Board moved to Kemal Manor in Chislehurst as part of the dispersal of departments from Woolwich; (in 1950 it moved again to Charles House on Kensington High Street). After the war, the Ordnance Board continued to provide independent authoritative advice on the development and design of weapons, ammunition and explosives; the positions of President of the Board and two Vice-Presidents were rotated between the three services.

The Ordnance Board and its name survived within the Ministry of Defence until the mid-1990s when it was renamed the Defence Ordnance Safety Group.

<text>Barton-under-Needwood is a village in the East Staffordshire district of Staffordshire, England. Situated a mile from the A38, and located between Burton upon Trent and Lichfield. It had a population of 4,225 at the 2011 census. It is also near to the Derbyshire village of Walton-on-Trent.

== History ==

The Tudor church of St James is a Grade II* listed building. It dates from 1517 and was built by Dr John Taylor, who lived at Barton and served as chaplain to Henry VIII. It is constructed in stone and is castellated. The church contains several notable funerary monuments.
The village has several shops and a village hall, local infant/junior schools and a larger secondary school: John Taylor High School, which serves Barton and the surrounding villages. It has seven pubs, six of which are owned by Marstons.

Barton also has a large marina complex on the Trent and Mersey Canal, home to some 300 narrow boats, with shops, a pub, a cinema and restaurants.

The village sports teams are based at the Holland Sports Club, which has facilities for cricket, football, rugby, tennis, netball and tug of war. The club is named after the Holland family who were resident in Barton for 600 years from the 14th century to the mid-1900s. The earliest recorded member of the family was Richard de Holland who was involved in the Battle of Burton Bridge in 1322 (see &#x27;Records of the Holland Family&#x27; published by William Holland).

The tug of war team have won many national and international honours since forming in 1970 – including the title &#x27;Guinness World Record Holders&#x27; for a record in Tug of War Endurance which was created in 2000, being selected to represent England at the 2008 World Tug of War Championships in Sweden, and winning a World Open Silver Medal at the 2010 Championships in Pretoria, South Africa, see TWIF records (World Governing Body) &#x27;Tug of War International Federation&#x27;.

Barton has four churches: St James C of E, Methodist, Roman Catholic and Christadelphian.

The name of the village had &quot;under Needwood&quot; added in 1327 to distinguish it from the other Bartons in England. Needwood Forest was a large area of ancient woodland in Staffordshire which was largely lost at the end of the 18th century. In 1995 a written history of Barton-under-Needwood was produced by Steve Gardner, named &quot;Under the Needwood Tree&quot;, with the assistance of a book committee. In 2001 Gardner published a sequel, &quot;Life and Times in Barton&quot;, and in 2007 a further volume: &quot;Memories of Old Barton&quot;.

Dunstall Hall is a stately home about a mile outside Barton in the hamlet of Dunstall. It is used as a conference centre and a venue for weddings.

Barton-under-Needwood Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1892. The club and course closed in the mid-1920s.

The UK&#x27;s first Travelodge was opened in 1985 on the A38 just outside the village, by Thomas Cartwright.

Between the 2005 and 2010 General Elections, the Needwood ward of East Staffordshire Borough Council (in which Barton-under-Needwood is the main settlement) was transferred from the Burton Parliamentary constituency to Lichfield.

<doc id="274487" wikidata="Q5223716" url="?curid=274487" title="Darkness in El Dorado">
<text>Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon is a polemical book written by author Patrick Tierney in 2000, in which the author accuses geneticist James Neel and anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon (the author of the 1968 book &quot;Yanomamö: The Fierce People&quot;) of conducting human research without regard for their subjects&#x27; well-being while conducting long-term ethnographic field work among the indigenous Yanomamo, in the Amazon basin between Venezuela and Brazil. He also wrote that the researchers had exacerbated a measles epidemic among the Native Americans, and that Jacques Lizot and Kenneth Good committed acts of sexual impropriety with Yanomamo.

While the book was positively reviewed and well received at first, later investigations by multiple independent organizations found Tierney&#x27;s main allegations to be false and libelous.

==Major claims and evaluations of these claims==
Claims made in &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot; included the following:
* Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel directly and indirectly caused a genocide in the region through the introduction of a live measles vaccine that was insufficiently attenuated. This claim has been refuted.
*The Yanomamo project was an outgrowth and continuation of the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s secret program of experiments on human subjects. This claim has been refuted.
*Chagnon&#x27;s accounts of the Yanomamo are based on false, non-existent or misinterpreted data, and Chagnon incited violence among them. Related claims and ethical issues are still the subject of much academic debate.
*French researcher Jacques Lizot, a protégé of Claude Lévi-Strauss, traded various uncustomary homosexual favors from Yanomamo boys after introducing shotguns and other foreign commodities into the community in what Tierney called &quot;shotgun-driven prostitution&quot;. Despite receiving critical support during a subsequent inquiry, these allegations attracted relatively little academic attention. 
*The American researcher Kenneth Good married a Yanomamo girl who was barely entering her teens. Good&#x27;s autobiographical accounts describe a complex personal relationship that developed in the context of Yanomamo (as well as American) cultural norms. He recounts that, in keeping with local customs and community wishes, he was betrothed to his future wife when she was still a child. They consummated the marriage when she was aged about 15 or 16.

==Assessments==
In 2000, Tierney published &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot;, which accused geneticist James Neel and anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon of exacerbating a measles epidemic among the Yanomamo people, among other damning allegations. This work initially received good reviews and was nominated for a National Book Award. Many of Tierney&#x27;s accusations against Chagnon were accepted as fact in a &quot;New York Times&quot; book review by science journalist John Horgan; the resulting political controversy resulted in Chagnon&#x27;s early retirement. Anthropologist John Tooby of &quot;Slate&quot; thought the book was internally inconsistent and suggested that it should have been identified as fiction.

Several inquiries related to Tierney&#x27;s allegations against the researchers were conducted by the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and outside evaluators. Tierney&#x27;s book was condemned by a number of academic researchers and professional associations, including the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Society of Human Genetics. They concluded that Tierney had fraudulently presented his allegations.

Tierney&#x27;s charges against Neel and Chagnon were initially investigated by the Peacock Commission, later known as the El Dorado Task Force, formed by the AAA. It supported Tierney and questioned the conduct of Neel and Chagnon; its findings were accepted by the AAA board in May 2002.

Because of dissension within the organization, the AAA subsequently requested an outside investigative team. It said in its preliminary report that the &quot;book appears to be deliberately fraudulent&quot;, and that &quot;Patrick Tierney has misconstrued or misrepresented his primary sources to a considerable degree in an effort to support his allegations.&quot; The investigators concluded it was not Chagnon who committed any wrongdoing, but Tierney, who fraudulently altered evidence to support a story he either at best imagined or at worst manufactured.

In 2004 Thomas A. Gregor and Daniel R. Gross published their investigation of the AAA&#x27;s reviews. In 2005 they called for the membership of the AAA to rescind the organization&#x27;s support of the book. This resolution passed, 846 to 338.

A detailed investigation of Tierney&#x27;s charges by a panel set up by the University of Michigan found the most serious charges to have no foundation and others to have been exaggerated. The provost&#x27;s office of the university refuted almost all of Tierney&#x27;s claims in November 2000. Sponsel and Turner, the two scientists who originally touted the book&#x27;s claims, admitted that their charge against Neel &quot;remains an inference in the present state of our knowledge: there is no &#x27;smoking gun&#x27; in the form of a written text or recorded speech by Neel.&quot;

Alice Dreger, a historian of medicine and science and an outsider to the debate, concluded after a year of research that Tierney&#x27;s claims about Chagnon and Neel were false. She wrote that the AAA was complicit and irresponsible in helping spread these falsehoods and not protecting &quot;scholars from baseless and sensationalistic charges&quot;.

The AAA rescinded its support of the book and acknowledged fraudulent, improper and unethical conduct by Tierney. The association admitted that &quot;in the course of its investigation, in its publications, in the venues of its national meetings and its web site, [the AAA] condoned a culture of accusation and allowed serious but unevaluated charges to be posted on its website and expressed in its newsletter and annual meetings&quot; and that its &quot;report has damaged the reputations of its targets, distracted public attention from the real sources of the Yanomamo tragedy and misleadingly suggested that anthropologists are responsible for Yanomamo suffering&quot;.

The accusations of inappropriate medical practices contained in Tierney&#x27;s book were investigated by the Medical Team of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and found to be false.

Following the controversy over &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot;, Tierney adopted a low profile, rarely appearing in public to defend his work. According to an investigation done at Dreger&#x27;s behest, Tierney had no training or employment in anthropology or journalism, but had traveled through South America under a false identity, cheated gold buyers, entered Yanomamo territory without legal permission, carried poisonous mercury into the rainforest, met with murderers, and may have gotten a man killed.

Tierney claimed to rely on a &quot;dossier&quot; of accusations made against Chagnon written by Leda Martins, a Venezuelan anthropologist, but Martins told Dreger that she did not write the dossier; she simply translated it into Portuguese. According to evidence Dreger compiled, the dossier was written by Tierney himself.

<text>The Hamilton Tigers were a professional ice hockey team based in Hamilton, Ontario that competed in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1920 to 1925. The Tigers were formed by the sale of the Quebec Bulldogs NHL franchise to Hamilton interests. After years of struggling, the franchise finished first in the league in the 1924–25 NHL season, but a players&#x27; strike before the playoffs resulted in the franchise&#x27;s dissolution. The players&#x27; contracts were sold to New York City interests to stock the expansion New York Americans. A namesake amateur team existed prior to and during the NHL team&#x27;s existence, and a minor league professional team named the Hamilton Tigers existed from 1926 to 1930.

==History==
The origins of the team go back to the old Quebec Hockey Club team that started play in 1878. Originally an amateur team, it turned professional in 1909. Quebec was a charter member of the NHL in 1917, however, due to financial difficulties, and the NHA-NHL dispute, the franchise was dormant until the 1919–20 season, when it was operated by the Quebec Athletic Club. That season proved to be a dismal one; despite the presence of Joe Malone the club finished with only four wins in 24 games.

After the 1919–20 season, the NHL took back the Quebec franchise and sold the team to the Abso Pure Ice Company of Hamilton, Ontario. The club was moved to Hamilton for the 1920–21 season and renamed the Hamilton Tigers. This was done to prevent the startup of a rival league that was trying to land a club in Hamilton. Hamilton was the fifth-largest city in the country and third-largest in Central Canada with a population of 114,200, and therefore was considered a vital market. Percy Thompson, a part-owner and manager of the Barton Street Arena, became manager of the team. The team became known as the Tigers, a nickname used by a multitude of sports teams in the city. Contemporary newspaper coverage often referred to the senior team of the same name in the OHA as the &quot;Tigers&quot;, while the NHL team would either be nameless or simply referred to as &quot;professionals&quot;.

The move to Hamilton did not improve the team&#x27;s record. Despite earning a shutout in their first game, the first team ever to do so, with a 5–0 win over the Montreal Canadiens on December 22, 1920, the Tigers were as noncompetitive as the Bulldogs. As a result, the NHL ordered the other three teams to supply players to the Tigers. Receiving quality players from the other teams was not enough to keep Hamilton out of the league cellar with 6 wins, 18 losses, and no ties in 24 games. Malone, kept out of the first four games for business reasons, scored 30 goals in 20 games.

The next three seasons were just as dreadful as the first. The Tigers finished dead last every year, making a total of 5 straight last place finishes (counting the one season as the Bulldogs). During these years, the Tigers attempted a rebuilding phase to bring the team up to par. After the 1921–22 NHL season, they hired Art Ross as their new coach and made several player changes, even trading superstar Malone to the Montreal Canadiens for Bert Corbeau and Edmond Bouchard. The fans were outraged at seeing Malone leave, but were vindicated when he scored a single goal in his lone season with the Canadiens.

Prior to the 1922–23 season, the NHL held its governors meeting at the Royal Connaught Hotel on King Street, the same location where visiting teams routinely stayed when playing the Tigers.

After four years of futility, things started to come together in the 1923–24 NHL season, with Percy LeSueur as the new head coach. Four players were acquired from the Sudbury Wolves of the NOHA: brothers Red and Shorty Green, Alex McKinnon, and Charlie Langlois, who all contributed to a team high of nine wins in 24 games. 

===Players revolt===

With yet another new head coach (Jimmy Gardner), the Hamilton Tigers roared off to an impressive 10–4–1 start in the 1924–25 NHL season. Only halfway through the season, they had more wins than any other season in their NHL history. The team slumped somewhat in the second half of the season but still managed to finish first overall with a record of 19 wins, 10 losses, and 1 tie, just ahead of the Toronto St. Patricks. It looked like the franchise would have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since winning it as the Bulldogs over a decade prior in 1913.

But it was not to be. During the rail travel back to Hamilton after the season&#x27;s final game, the Tigers&#x27; players went to their general manager, Percy Thompson, and demanded $200 pay for the six extra games they played that season or they would not play in the playoffs. The NHL had increased the number of games played that year from 24 to 30, but the players didn&#x27;t receive an increase in pay. The Tigers management, stating that the players&#x27; contracts stated that the players were under contract from December 1 to March 30, regardless of the number of games, refused to pay the money and passed the issue to the NHL. Thus began the first players&#x27; strike in NHL history.

NHL President Frank Calder warned the players that if they sat out the final, they would be suspended and replaced in the final by fourth-place Ottawa. At the same time, Calder ordered that the players&#x27; back-pay be held. The impasse continued while second-place Toronto and third-place Montreal played their semi-final, ending with Montreal winning on March 13. On March 14, after consulting with Tigers management, Calder declared the Canadiens league champions and fined the Tigers&#x27; players $200. The Canadiens then went on to play the Victoria Cougars for the Stanley Cup but lost. That marked the last time that an NHL team had lost the Stanley Cup to a rival league.

===Takeover by New York===
Thomas Duggan of Montreal, owner of the Mount Royal Arena, held two options for expansion teams in the United States. He sold the first of the two to Boston grocery magnate Charles Adams, who used it to start the Boston Bruins. He sold the second to a New York bootlegger named &quot;Big Bill&quot; Dwyer for a team to play in New York. At the NHL league meeting of April 17, 1925, Dwyer was granted an expansion franchise for New York.

Although Dwyer wished to purchase the Hamilton players, for a little while it seemed that Hamilton might remain in the NHL as Abso-Pure talked about building a new arena. The arena was not built and Dwyer bought the rights to the Tigers&#x27; players from Thompson for $75,000. Although Dwyer was ostensibly the owner of the Americans, due to his underworld ties he was not publicly named by the NHL at the meeting announcing the team. Instead, Colonel Hammond of Madison Square Garden, Duggan, and former Ottawa manager Tommy Gorman were announced as the officers. The new team was for a time known as the &quot;New York Hamilton Tigers&quot; by the time it reached training camp, but this was changed to the New York Americans. A Hamilton franchise was still considered to play in the NHL for the 1925–26 season, with a preliminary schedule including such a team, but nothing came of it.

The last active Tigers player was Billy Burch, who retired in 1933.

==Other Hamilton Tigers ice hockey teams==
===The OHA Tigers===
At the time, the city had another Tigers hockey club, fielding teams in the Ontario Hockey Association, the senior team playing in the OHA Senior A League. The senior Tigers wore the same black and gold colours as the NHL Tigers, and were just as popular. When the newspapers reported about &quot;the Tigers&quot; it was usually in reference to the amateurs, while the NHL team was called &quot;the Professionals.&quot; The senior Tigers continued into the 1950s, winning the OHA championship in 1919, 1931, 1934, 1942 and 1944–1948. The team won the Allan Cup in 1919 and lost in the 1931 and 1946 finals.

George Redding coached the Tigers in the 1940s, and credited journalist Ivan Miller for originating the &quot;Tattered Tigers&quot; nickname in 1945, referring to old uniforms worn by the team on route to reaching the 1946 Allan Cup finals.

===Hamilton Tigers (CPHL)===

In 1926–27, a new Tigers team was formed as an expansion franchise in the minor-pro Canadian Professional Hockey League. This Tigers team, along with the larger teams in the CPHL, broke away in 1929 to form the International Hockey League. In 1930, the Tigers moved to Syracuse, New York to become the Syracuse Stars. This franchise, along with three other IHL teams, merged with the Canadian-American Hockey League to form the International-American Hockey League, forerunner of today&#x27;s American Hockey League. In 1940, the Stars were sold and transferred to Buffalo, New York to become the Buffalo Bisons, who survived until being displaced by the NHL&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres in 1970.

<doc id="274492" wikidata="Q1997910" url="?curid=274492" title="Fyrd">
<text>A fyrd was a type of early Anglo-Saxon army that was mobilised from freemen or paid men to defend their Shire&#x27;s lords estate, or from selected representatives to join a royal expedition. Service in the fyrd was usually of short duration and participants were expected to provide their own arms and provisions. 

The composition of the fyrd evolved over the years, particularly as a reaction to raids and invasions by the Vikings. The system of defence and conscription was reorganised during the reign of Alfred the Great, who set up 33 fortified towns (or burhs) in his kingdom of Wessex. The amount of taxation required to maintain each town was laid down in a document known as the Burghal Hidage. Each lord had his individual holding of land assessed in hides. Based on his land holding, he had to contribute men and arms to maintain and defend the burhs. Non-compliance with this requirement could lead to severe penalties.

Ultimately the fyrd consisted of a nucleus of experienced soldiers that would be supplemented by ordinary villagers and farmers from the shires who would accompany their lords.

==Definitions==

The Germanic rulers in early medieval Britain relied upon the infantry supplied by a regional levy, or fyrd and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended. In Anglo-Saxon documents military service might be expressed as fyrd-faru, fyrd-færeld, fyrd-socn, or simply fyrd. The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire, in which all freemen had to serve. Those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land. According to the laws of Ine:

It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom, however in the case of hit and run raids, particularly by Vikings, problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough, so it was rarely summoned.

Historians are divided on whether or not the fyrd included thegns and mercenaries. Initially the force probably would have been entirely infantry. However, from Alfred&#x27;s time there would have been a force of mounted infantry, who could gallop swiftly to any trouble spot, dismount, and drive off any raiding force. Also, after Alfred&#x27;s reorganisation there were two elements to his army. The first known as the &quot;select-fyrd&quot; was, most likely, a strictly royal force of mounted infantry consisting mainly of thegns and their retainers supported by earls and reeves. The second would be the local militia or &quot;general-fyrd&quot; responsible for the defence of the shire and borough district and would consist of freemen, such as small tenant farmers and their local thegns and reeves. In the 11th century the infantry was strengthened by the addition of an elite force of housecarls. More recent research, however, suggests that there was only a &quot;select-fyrd&quot;, in which the mounted element was provided by Wessex.

The Old English term that the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; uses for the Danish Army is &quot;here&quot;; Ine of Wessex in his law code, issued in about 694, provides a definition of &quot;here&quot; as &quot;an invading army or raiding party containing more than thirty-five men&quot;, yet the terms &quot;here&quot; and &quot;fyrd&quot; are used interchangeably in later sources in respect of the English militia.

Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding; the so-called ‘common burdens&#x27; of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. Even when a landholder was granted exemptions from other royal services, these three duties were reserved. An example of this is in a charter of 858 where Æthelberht, King of Wessex, made an exchange of land with his thegn Wulflaf. It stipulates that Wulflaf&#x27;s land should be free of all royal services and secular burdens except military service, the building of bridges, and fortress work.

According to Cnut&#x27;s laws:
England had suffered raids by the Vikings from the late 8th century onwards, initially mainly on monasteries. The first monastery to be raided was in 793 at Lindisfarne, off the north east coast, with the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; describing the Vikings as &quot;heathen men&quot;. The raiding continued on and off until the 860s, when instead of raiding the Vikings changed their tactics and sent a great army to invade England. This army was described by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; as a &quot;Great Heathen Army&quot;. The Danes were eventually defeated by Alfred the Great at the Battle of Edington in 878. This was followed closely by the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, under which England was divided up between the Anglo-Saxons of Wessex and the Vikings. However, there continued to be a threat by another Danish army that was active on the continent. The rampaging Viking army on the continent encouraged Alfred to protect his Kingdom of Wessex. He built a navy, reorganised the army, established a cavalry, and set up a system of fortified towns known as burhs.

Each element of the system was meant to remedy defects in the West Saxon military establishment exposed by Viking raids and invasions. If under the existing system he could not assemble forces quickly enough to intercept mobile Viking raiders, the obvious answer was to have a standing field force. If this entailed transforming the West Saxon fyrd from a sporadic levy of king&#x27;s men and their retinues into a mounted standing army, so be it. If his kingdom lacked strongpoints to impede the progress of an enemy army, he would build them. If the enemy struck from the sea, he would counter them with his own naval power. To maintain the burhs, and the standing army, he set up a system of taxation and conscription that is recorded in a document, now known as the Burghal Hidage; thirty three fortified towns are listed along with their taxable value (known as hides). Characteristically, all of Alfred&#x27;s innovations were firmly rooted in traditional West Saxon practice, drawing as they did upon the three ‘common burdens&#x27; that all holders of bookland and royal loanland owed the Crown. Where Alfred revealed his genius was in designing the field force and burhs to be parts of a coherent military system.

The &quot;fyrd&quot; was used heavily by King Harold in 1066, for example in resisting invasion by Harald Hardrada and William of Normandy.

Henry I of England, the Anglo-Norman king who promised at his coronation to restore the laws of Edward the Confessor and who married a Scottish princess with West Saxon royal forebears, called up the &quot;fyrd&quot; to supplement his feudal levies, as an army of all England, as Orderic Vitalis reports, to counter the abortive invasions of his brother Robert Curthose, both in the summer of 1101 and in autumn 1102.

A view of early American military organization, considered the &quot;fyrd&quot; the abstract principle for the defense of colonial Virginia.

<text>Saint-Jean County is an historical county in Quebec on the west bank of the Richelieu River, about 40 km southeast of Montreal. The county was organized in 1854 from the counties of Huntingdon and Chambly. Its extent included the parishes of L&#x27;Acadie, Lacolle, St. Luc, St. Valentin, and St. Jean, as well as the city and county seat of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. In the early 1980s, when Quebec abolished its counties, most of Saint-Jean County was transferred to Le Haut-Richelieu Regional County Municipality, and the southwestern corner was transferred to Les Jardins-de-Napierville Regional County Municipality.

<doc id="274506" wikidata="Q430007" url="?curid=274506" title="Tiger's eye">
<text>Tiger&#x27;s eye (also called tiger eye) is a
chatoyant gemstone that is usually a metamorphic rock with a golden to red-brown colour and a silky lustre. As members of the quartz group, tiger&#x27;s eye and the related blue-coloured mineral hawk&#x27;s eye gain their silky, lustrous appearance from the parallel intergrowth of quartz crystals and altered amphibole fibres that have mostly turned into limonite.

==Other forms of tiger&#x27;s eye==
&quot;Tiger iron&quot; is an altered rock composed chiefly of tiger&#x27;s eye, red jasper and black hematite. The undulating, contrasting bands of colour and lustre make for an attractive motif and it is mainly used for jewellery-making and ornamentation. Tiger iron is a popular ornamental material used in a variety of applications, from beads to knife hilts.

Tiger iron is mined primarily in South Africa and Western Australia. Tiger&#x27;s eye is composed chiefly of silicon dioxide () and is coloured mainly by iron oxide. The specific gravity ranges from 2.64 to 2.71. It is formed by the alteration of crocidolite.

Serpentine deposits in the US states of Arizona and California can have chatoyant bands of chrysotile, a form of asbestos, fibres. These have been cut and sold as &quot;Arizona tiger-eye&quot; and &quot;California tiger&#x27;s eye&quot; gemstones. The trade name &#x27;pietersite&#x27; is used for a fractured or brecciated chalcedony containing amphibole fibers and promoted as tiger&#x27;s eye from Namibia and China.

==Sources==

Common sources of tiger&#x27;s eye include Australia, Burma, India, Namibia, South Africa, the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Korea and Spain.

==Cultural associations==
In some parts of the world, the stone is believed to ward off the evil eye.

Roman soldiers wore engraved tigers eye to protect them in battle.

==Cut, treatment and imitation==

Gems are usually given a cabochon cut to best display their chatoyance. Red stones are developed by gentle heat treatments. Dark stones are artificially lightened to improve colour using a nitric acid treatment.

Honey-coloured stones have been used to imitate the more valued cat&#x27;s eye chrysoberyl, cymophane, but the overall effect is often unconvincing. Artificial fibre optic glass is a common imitation of tiger&#x27;s eye, and is produced in a wide range of colours.

<doc id="274508" wikidata="Q3586269" url="?curid=274508" title="1997 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1997 Canadian federal election was held on June 2, 1997, to elect members to the House of Commons of the 36th Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal Party won a second majority government. The Reform Party replaced the Bloc Québécois as the Official Opposition.

The election results closely followed the pattern of the 1993 election. The Liberals swept Ontario, while the Bloc won a majority in Quebec. Reform made sufficient gains in the West to allow Preston Manning to become leader of the Official Opposition, but lost its only seat east of Manitoba. The most significant change was major gains in Atlantic Canada by the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the rump Progressive Conservative Party. The Liberal victory was not in doubt, though some commentators on election night were predicting that the party would be cut down to a minority government and that Chrétien might lose his seat. Chrétien narrowly won his riding, and the Liberals maintained a narrow five-seat majority thanks to gains in Quebec at the expense of the Bloc. Jean Charest&#x27;s Tories and Alexa McDonough&#x27;s NDP both regained official party status in the House of Commons.

This was the first time that five political parties held official party status in a single session of Canada&#x27;s Parliament, and the only time to date that five different parties have won the popular vote in at least one of the provinces and territories of Canada.

==Background==
Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced his approved request by Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to dissolve Parliament on April 26, 1997, with an election to be held on June 2 of that year. Chrétien&#x27;s election call came three years and five months into Parliament&#x27;s life, short of both the maximum five year duration and the typical four years between elections. This represented the earliest election call in a majority Parliament since the 1911 election. Opinion polls at the time predicted that the Liberal Party was expected to win a landslide victory capturing at least 180 to 220 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons, with the fragmentation of the opposition meaning that one party was not expected to be able to defeat the government.

The election call was controversial both for being early and for occurring during Manitoba&#x27;s recovery from the Red River Flood earlier in the year. Reg Alcock and several others inside the Liberal Party had opposed the timing of the vote, and the poor results prompted Paul Martin&#x27;s supporters to organize against Chrétien.

The election was the first to be held with staggered polling hours across the country. Until 1993, polling hours were 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. in each time zone, with a 4.5-hour difference between closing of polls in Newfoundland and those in British Columbia and Yukon, or a three-hour difference between Quebec-Ontario and B.C.-Yukon. With the new staggered hours, it would be three hours between Newfoundland and B.C.-Yukon, but just 30 minutes between Quebec-Ontario and B.C.-Yukon.

==Political Parties==

===Liberal Party===

The Liberal Party under Jean Chrétien campaigned on promising to continue to cut the federal deficit to allow for a budget surplus, and then to spend one half of the surplus on repaying Canada&#x27;s national debt and cutting taxes while the other half of the surplus would be used to increase funding to health care, assistance for Canadian children in poverty, and job creation. The platform was called &quot;Securing Our Future Together&quot;. The Liberal Party was attacked by the opposition parties for failing to keep many of the promises that the party campaigned on in the 1993 federal election. The Liberals attacked the Progressive Conservatives and the Reform Party for prematurely calling for tax cuts while a deficit still remained while attacking the New Democratic Party for proposing to increase government spending while Canada faced a deficit.

The Liberals suffered from a number of gaffes in their campaign. In one incident, when Jean Chrétien was questioned by reporters over the cost of the Liberals&#x27; election proposal of a national pharmacare program, reporters claimed that Chrétien was unsure of what the cost would be. Chrétien also turned down invitations for interviews by Canada&#x27;s national media outlets, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and MuchMusic. In the televised debates between the five major political parties, Chrétien apologized to Canadians for his government having cut funding for social programs to reduce the deficit.

On election day, the Liberals won with a significantly reduced majority. While they lost much of their support in Atlantic Canada, they won all but two seats in Ontario and improved on their numbers in Quebec. They were only assured of a majority when the final numbers came in from Western Canada.

===Reform Party===

The Reform Party under Preston Manning campaigned on preserving national unity through decentralization of multiple federal government powers to all of the provinces, cutting taxes, reducing the size of government, reducing spending, and strongly opposing distinct society status for Quebec. Feeling that the general acceptance of deficit reduction at the federal and provincial level had been encouraged by their party, Reform saw a chance to finally make the party a national in scope by making political inroads outside of the west, particularly in Ontario. Their platform was titled the &quot;Fresh Start for all Canadians&quot;. The Reformers ran a full slate of candidates in Quebec, making this the first and last election in which it would run candidates in every region of Canada.

Reform&#x27;s campaign ran into multiple problems. The party was repeatedly accused by other parties and the media of holding intolerant views due to comments made by a number of Reform MPs during the writ period. Critics had accused the party&#x27;s performance during the 1993–1997 parliament of being disorganized. Tension between the party&#x27;s democratic nature and the leader-centric model of modern campaigning led to Manning&#x27;s leadership abilities being questioned by a number of former members, including Stephen Harper, who accused Manning of inappropriately using a Can$31,000 personal expense allowance as leader. Some Reform supporters were frustrated by the party&#x27;s decision to expand its political base into Quebec, as they continued to believe that the party should represent English-speaking Canada, and others from the right-wing and populist faction of the party were angry that Manning punished MPs Bob Ringma and David Chatters for outbursts. During the campaign the Reform Party released a controversial television advertisement where the faces of four Quebecers, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest, and Premier of Quebec Lucien Bouchard, were crossed out, followed by a message saying that Quebec politicians had dominated the federal government for too long and that the Reform Party would end this favoritism towards Quebec. The advertisement was harshly criticized by the other party leaders including accusations that Manning was &quot;intolerant&quot; and a &quot;bigot&quot; for having permitted the advertisement to be aired.

Reform began the campaign with Can$1.5 million in cash on hand, and had raised a total of Can$8 million. In contrast to the other parties, the vast majority of the money came from donations by individuals or small businesses.

The results for Reform were a generally considered a minor tactical success. The party won 60 seats to displace the Bloc as Official Opposition, largely by building on its already heavy concentration of support in Western Canada. Strategically, Reform failed to make inroads into eastern Canada and lost its one seat in Ontario, leaving it effectively perceived as a Western regional party, despite making their first significant inroads into rural Ontario.

===Bloc Québécois===

The Bloc Québécois, under the leadership of Gilles Duceppe, lost its position of Official Opposition, falling to third place. The party&#x27;s founding leader, Lucien Bouchard, had resigned in the aftermath of the 1995 Quebec referendum in order to become Premier of Quebec. Bouchard had been replaced by Michel Gauthier, but a lack of direction and party infighting caused their poll numbers to plummet, leaving them in danger of being overhauled by both the Liberals and the resurgent Progressive Conservatives. Duceppe, who took over as leader after Gauthier resigned, nonetheless made progress by emphasizing the lack of possibility of constitutional reform. While the party only finished 1.2 percentage points ahead of the Liberals in the province&#x27;s popular vote, a more efficiently-distributed vote (the Liberal vote was too concentrated in and around Montreal; elsewhere, they split the vote with the Progressive Conservatives) still allowed them capture a comfortable majority of 44 out of Quebec&#x27;s 75 seats.

===New Democratic Party===

The New Democratic Party under the leadership of Alexa McDonough regained official party status that the party lost in the 1993 Canadian federal election. The party won the fourth largest share of total votes and won 21 seats. Notably, the party made a substantial showing in Atlantic Canada, a region where it had only elected three MPs in its entire history prior to the election.

===Progressive Conservative Party===

The Progressive Conservative Party under Jean Charest campaigned on securing national unity in Canada by recognizing Quebec as being a distinct society within Canada, along with the proposal of a &quot;New Covenant&quot; for Canadian confederation to be negotiated between the Federal and Provincial governments. The party&#x27;s platform included the novelty of being publicly distributed on CD-ROM. Charest and the PCs benefited from rapidly rising in popularity amongst all language groups in Quebec, where voters were found to have preferred Charest over Gilles Duceppe, the leader of the Bloc Québécois.

The Progressive Conservatives faced multiple difficulties, as the party was not able to apply for federal financial assistance due to it not being an official party. The party&#x27;s results in their previous bastion of Western Canada remained anemic, and the Reformers remained the dominant conservative political force in the west. Reform also made inroads into rural central and southern Ontario — traditionally the heartland of the Tories&#x27; provincial counterparts.

The Progressive Conservatives won the third largest number of the total votes and improved their situation in the House of Commons, regaining official party status after winning 20 seats. Despite finishing about half a point behind Reform in the nationwide popular vote, their only heavy concentrations of support were in Atlantic Canada and Quebec. Elsewhere, like in 1993, their support was too spread out to translate into victories in individual ridings. They only won one seat each in Ontario and Manitoba, and none west of Manitoba. The result, a disappointment for Charest, would lead to his resignation and eventual assumption of leadership of the Liberal Party of Quebec.

===Green Party===
Support for the Green Party of Canada was 79% higher than at the previous election, with its greatest success in British Columbia, where it received 2% of the vote. The Green Party remained almost entirely off the national media&#x27;s radar. At 0.43% of the vote, and 1.64% of the vote in the ridings it contested, the Green Party remained a small but growing movement.

===Notes===
* Number of parties: 10
** First appearance: Canadian Action Party
** Final appearance: Reform Party of Canada
** Final appearance before hiatus: Christian Heritage Party of Canada (returned in 2004)
* 1997 was one of only three elections in Canadian history (the others were 1993 and 2008) where the official Opposition did not have the majority of the opposition&#x27;s seats. 60 seats were held by the Reform Party, yet 86 seats for the other opposition parties and independents combined. 
* 1997 was the only election to date in which five different parties won the popular vote in a province or territory (the Liberals won in Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Ontario and Prince Edward Island; Reform in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan; the BQ in Quebec; the NDP in the Yukon Territory; and the PCs in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia). Consequently, it was also the last time the PCs won a province or territory.

<text>Helmetshrikes are the eight species of smallish to mid-sized songbirds in the genus Prionops. They were previously included with the true shrikes in the family Laniidae, later on split between several presumably closely related groups such as bushshrikes (Malaconotidae) and cuckooshrikes (Campephagidae), but are now considered sufficiently distinctive to be separated from that group into the family Vangidae.

==Description and ecology==

This is an African group of species which are found in scrub or open woodland. They are similar in feeding habits to shrikes, hunting insects and other small prey from a perch on a bush or tree.

Although similar in build to the shrikes, these tend to be colourful species with the distinctive crests or other head ornaments, such as wattles, from which they get their name.

Helmetshrikes are noisy and sociable birds, some of which breed in loose colonies. They lay 2–4 eggs in neat, well-hidden nests.

==Systematics==

As the relationships of the shrike-like birds are increasingly disentangled, the helmetshrikes appear to form an evolutionary radiation with the Vangidae.

<text>Lloyd Vernet Bridges Jr. (January 15, 1913 – March 10, 1998) was an American film, stage and television actor who starred in a number of television series and appeared in more than 150 feature films. He was the father of four children, including the actors Beau Bridges and Jeff Bridges. He started his career as a contract performer for Columbia Pictures, appearing in films such as &quot;Sahara&quot; (1943), &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (1945), &quot;Little Big Horn&quot; (1951) and &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952). On television, he starred in &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; (1958-1961). By the end of his career, he had re-invented himself and demonstrated a comedic talent in such parody films as &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; (1991), and &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Mafia!&quot; (1998). Among other honors, Bridges was a two-time Emmy Award nominee. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 1, 1994.

In &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941) Bridges is the pilot of the plane in the &quot;heaven&quot; scene.

Bridges later reflected,
 
He left Columbia Pictures during World War II to enlist in the United States Coast Guard. Following his discharge, he returned to acting. In later years, he was a member of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, did several public service announcements for the organization, and was made an honorary commodore. Bridges&#x27; &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; character Mike Nelson was also portrayed as a member of the Coast Guard Auxiliary and sometimes appeared in uniform. Bridges&#x27; sons, actors Beau and Jeff, also served in the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Reserve. 
===Post-war career===

He had a good role in &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; (1949). At Universal he was Howard Duff&#x27;s friend in &quot;Calamity Jane and Sam Bass&quot; (1949), again for Sherman.
Bridges had the star role in &quot;Trapped&quot; (1949) directed by Richard Fleischer for Eagle Lion and &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; (1950) for Lippert Pictures. He had supporting roles in &quot;Colt .45&quot; (1951), &quot;The White Tower&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (1950) (directed by Cy Endfield).

===Blacklisting===

Bridges was blacklisted briefly in the 1950s after he admitted to the House Un-American Activities Committee that he had once been a member of the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre, a group found to have had links to the Communist Party USA. He returned to acting after recanting his membership and serving as a cooperative witness, achieving his greatest success in television.

Bridges made his TV debut in 1951 with &quot;Man&#x27;s First Debt&quot; in &quot;The Bigelow Theatre&quot;. He had starring roles in the films &quot;The Fighting Seventh&quot; (1951), &quot;Three Steps North&quot; (1951), and &quot;Richer Than the Earth&quot; (1951).

On TV he did &quot;Rise Up and Walk&quot; for &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; (1952) and &quot;International Incident&quot; for &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot; (1952) (the latter directed by Franklin J. Schaffner). Bridges had a supporting role in &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952).

Bridges guest starred on &quot;Suspense&quot; (&quot;Her Last Adventure&quot;) and &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; (&quot;This Plane for Hire&quot;), and had support roles in &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Sabre and the Arrow&quot; (1953). Bridges returned to leads in &quot;The Tall Texan&quot; (1953) for Lippert Pictures.

He had the lead in a horse movie, &quot;Prince of the Blue Grass&quot; (1954) and returned to England to make &quot;Third Party Risk&quot; (1954) for Hammer Films.

In Hollywood Bridges supported Joel McCrea in &quot;Wichita&quot; (1955) and had the lead in Roger Corman&#x27;s low-budget &quot;Apache Woman&quot; (1955).

===Television===

On TV Bridges performed in &quot;Broadway Trust&quot; for &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1955), &quot;The Dark Fleece&quot; and &quot;Edge of Terror&quot; for &quot;Climax!&quot; (1955) (the latter directed by John Frankenheimer), &quot;The Ainsley Case&quot; for &quot;Front Row Center&quot; (1956), &quot;Across the Dust&quot; and &quot;Prairie Dog Court&quot; for &quot;Chevron Hall of Stars&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Silent Gun&quot; and &quot;American Primitive&quot; for &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot; (1956). He had the lead in the low budget &quot;Wetbacks&quot; (1956) and a support role in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1956).

Bridges gained attention in 1956 for his emotional performance on the live anthology program &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, in an episode titled &quot;Tragedy in a Temporary Town&quot; written by Reginald Rose and directed by Sidney Lumet. During the performance, Bridges inadvertently used profanity while ad-libbing. Although the slip of the tongue generated hundreds of complaints, the episode won a Robert E. Sherwood Television Award, with Bridges&#x27; slip being defended even by some members of the clergy. Bridges received an Emmy Award nomination for the role.

Bridges did &quot;The Regulators&quot; for &quot;Studio 57&quot; (1956), &quot;They Never Forget&quot; for &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; (1957), &quot;Ride the Wild Mare&quot; for &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot; (1957), &quot;Man on the Outside&quot; for &quot;Studio 57&quot; (1957), &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, &quot;Figures in Clay&quot; and &quot;The Disappearance of Amanda Hale&quot; for &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Heritage of Anger&quot; (1956) and &quot;Clash by Night&quot; (1957) for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, the latter with Kim Stanley. Bridges also made several episodes of &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot; including &quot;Time of Decision&quot; (1957) and &quot;Wire&quot; (1958).

He supported Rory Calhoun in &quot;Ride Out for Revenge&quot; (1957) and did &quot;A Time to Cry&quot; on &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; (1958) and had one of his best ever cinema roles in &quot;The Goddess&quot; (1958) based on a script by Paddy Chayefsky based on the life of Marilyn Monroe; Bridges played a sportsman based on Joe di Maggio opposite Kim Stanley. He directed &quot;Piano to Thunder Springs&quot; for &quot;Target&quot; (1958).

===&quot;Sea Hunt&quot; (1958–1961)===
Bridges gained wide recognition as Mike Nelson, the main character in the television series &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, created by Ivan Tors, which ran in syndication from 1958 to 1961. He also wrote a book with a co-author about skin-diving entitled &quot;Mask and Flippers&quot;.
Bridges did &quot;Lepke&quot; (1959) for &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot; (1960), &quot;Ransom&quot; (1960) (directed by Budd Boetticher) and &quot;Image of a Drawn Sword&quot; (1961) for &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot;. He did a TV movie &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1960), &quot;Death of the Temple Bay&quot; for &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot; (1961), &quot;Who Killed Julie Greer?&quot; (1961) for &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Fortress&quot; (1961) for &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot; (with Fred Astaire), and &quot;The Two of Us&quot; (1962) for &quot;Checkmate&quot;. He also did a special &quot;Marineland Carnival&quot; (1962).

===&quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot; (1962–1963)===
Bridges starred in the eponymous CBS anthology series &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot; (1962–1963) (produced by Aaron Spelling) which included appearances by his sons Beau and Jeff.

Bridges followed it with &quot;A Hero for Our Times&quot; for &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot; (1963), &quot;Wild Bill Hickok – the Legend and the Man&quot; for &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; (1964), &quot;Cannibal Plants, They Eat You Alive&quot; for &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; (1964) and &quot;Exit from a Plane in Flight&quot; for &quot;Theater of Stars&quot; (1965).

Producer Gene Roddenberry offered Bridges a starring role on what became &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Bridges declined, saying he got along well with Roddenberry on a personal level but had no desire to work in science fiction. The part went to Jeffrey Hunter for the pilot episode &quot;The Cage&quot; and ultimately to William Shatner for the first incarnation of the television series. 

===&quot;The Loner&quot;===

Bridges starred in the western series &quot;The Loner,&quot; which lasted one season from 1965 to 1966 and was created and often written by Rod Serling. &quot;The Loner&quot; earned solid reviews but was cancelled due to low ratings and a perception the show was too realistic or mature for audiences who expected escapist action from westerns.

<text>Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu () is a city in eastern Montérégie in the Canadian province of Quebec, about southeast of Montreal, located roughly halfway between Montreal and the Canada–United States border with the state of Vermont. It is situated on both the west and east banks of the Richelieu River at the northernmost navigable point of Lake Champlain. As of December 2019, the population of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu was 98,036.

==History==
Historically, the city has been an important transportation hub. The first railway line in British North America connected it with La Prairie in 1836. It also hosts the annual International Balloon Festival of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, a hot air balloon festival which attracts thousands of tourists who come to see the hundreds of balloons in the sky each August.

The Chambly Canal extends north along the west bank of the river and provides modern freight passage to Chambly and the St. Lawrence River. The canal has one lock near the downtown core of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. In the winter, the city builds a skating rink on the canal near the lock. In the summer, the embankment on the east side of the canal has a cycling path.

The French built Fort Saint-Jean in the seventeenth century. Known to early English settlers as St. Johns, it provided an important communication link during the French and Indian Wars. During the American Revolutionary War control of the town changed hands several times as British and American forces moved through the area.

In 2001 the city and several adjoining communities were merged into the new regional county municipality with a population to 79,600. This merger was requested by the five municipalities involved and was not part of the municipal fusions imposed by the Quebec government the following year.
==Geography==
Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu is located on the banks of the Richelieu River. The city is the seat of Le Haut-Richelieu regional county municipality and of the judicial district of Iberville.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
The city is divided in five sectors which refer to the former municipalities. Each sector contains different neighbourhoods:

* Iberville (9,424)
* Saint-Athanase (6,691)
* L&#x27;Acadie (5,526)

The largest visible minority groups were Black (1.4%) and Latin American (0.8%).

==Economy==
Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu is home to the Carrefour Richelieu regional shopping mall which has 115 stores.

Newer retail developments include Faubourg Saint-Jean, home to restaurants, services, stores, and a soon-to-open movie theatre.

The historic downtown area, which borders the Richelieu River and includes Richelieu and Champlain streets, is home to a variety of locally owned bars, restaurants, and shops.

St-Jean is a manufacturing centre for textiles, wood products, sporting equipment, and metal transformation. It hosts an Area Support Unit (ASU) of the Canadian Forces, which functions as a primary recruit and officer training establishment.

==Infrastructure==
The Ville de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu public transit system provides commuter and local bus services.

According to the 2016 Census, 22,840 residents, or 56.7% of the labour force work within the city. An additional 5,135 (12.7%) commute to Montreal, while 2,305 (5.7%) work in Longueuil, 1,440 (3.6%) work in Brossard, and 965 (2.4%) work in Chambly.

By contrast only 770 people commute from Montreal to work in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu every day, while 795 people commute from Longueuil, 780 commute from Chambly, 510 commute from Saint-Alexandre and 500 commute from Mont-Saint-Grégoire.

===Transportation===

The city is split in two by Autoroute de la Vallée-des-Forts (Autoroute 35) which goes north–south by going first through Saint-Luc district, then turns east just south of Pierre-Caisse Boulevard in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu district to cross the Richelieu River and to finally continue its way south through St-Athanase and Iberville districts. The highway continues south for some 24 km before ending at Saint-Sébastien, but it is expected to be extended all the way to the Canada-United States border at Saint-Armand (Highgate Springs, Vermont) in the future, and will then continue as Interstate 89 in Vermont.

Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu has its own municipal airport, Saint-Jean Airport, and is also close to Montreal Pierre-Elliot Trudeau International Airport.

The former International Railway of Maine runs through the town, now the connecting point for the Central Maine and Quebec Railway with the Canadian Pacific Railway. The former Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Iberville railway station, which until 1966 served the &quot;Ambassador&quot; to Boston and New York City and the &quot;Washingtonian&quot; to Washington, D.C., is now a preserved building.

==Education==

The South Shore Protestant Regional School Board previously served the municipality.

In addition to more than a dozen public elementary and secondary schools, St-Jean is home to two private schools, one English-language school, and two higher education institutions:
* Ecole du quatre vent elementary French school
* École Vision Saint-Jean, a trilingual (French-English-Spanish) primary school
* École Secondaire Marcellin Champagnat, a historically Catholic (now non-religious) high school
* Saint-John&#x27;s School, the city&#x27;s only English-language school, which serves students from Kindergarten through high school. Per Quebec law, only children whose parents attended English-language school are allowed to attend English school themselves; French is mandatory for everyone else. 
* Royal Military College Saint-Jean () serves as a one-year preparatory program for the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Original founded in 1952, it ceased being a degree granting military college in 1995 due to cuts to military funding. RMCSJ continued to provide non-degree college programs for French-speaking cadets of the Canadian Forces. The Canadian federal government reopened the military college at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in the fall of 2007 to provide the full first year of university, equivalent to the Kingston program, for students with English- or French-language backgrounds alongside the college program.
* CEGEP Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, part of Quebec&#x27;s CEGEP network, offering post-secondary, pre-university programs

<text>In computer science, a consistency model specifies a contract between the programmer and a system, wherein the system guarantees that if the programmer follows the rules for operations on memory, memory will be consistent and the results of reading, writing, or updating memory will be predictable. Consistency models are used in distributed systems like distributed shared memory systems or distributed data stores (such as filesystems, databases, optimistic replication systems or web caching). Consistency is different from coherence, which occurs in systems that are cached or cache-less, and is consistency of data with respect to all processors. Coherence deals with maintaining a global order in which writes to a single location or single variable are seen by all processors. Consistency deals with the ordering of operations to multiple locations with respect to all processors.

High level languages, such as C++ and Java, maintain the consistency contract by translating memory operations into low-level operations in a way that preserves memory semantics, reordering some memory instructions, and encapsulating required synchronization with library calls such as codice_1.

== Example ==
Assume that the following case occurs:
* The row X is replicated on nodes M and N
* The client A writes row X to node M
* After a period of time t, client B reads row X from node N

The consistency model determines whether client B will definitely see the write performed by client A, will definitely not, or cannot depend on seeing the write.

== Types ==

Consistency models define rules for the apparent order and visibility of updates, and are on a continuum with tradeoffs. There are two methods to define and categorize consistency models; issue and view.
; Issue: Issue method describes the restrictions that define how a process can issue operations.
; View: View method which defines the order of operations visible to processes.

For example, a consistency model can define that a process is not allowed to issue an operation until all previously issued operations are completed. Different consistency models enforce different conditions. One consistency model can be considered stronger than another if it requires all conditions of that model and more. In other words, a model with fewer constraints is considered a weaker consistency model.

These models define how the hardware needs to be laid out and at a high-level, how the programmer must code. The chosen model also affects how the compiler can re-order instructions. Generally, if control dependencies between instructions and if writes to same location are ordered, then the compiler can reorder as required. However, with the models described below, some may allow writes before loads to be reordered while some may not.

== Strong consistency models ==

=== Strict consistency ===

Strict consistency is the strongest consistency model. Under this model, a write to a variable by any processor needs to be seen instantaneously by all processors.

The strict model diagram and non-strict model diagrams describe the time constraint – instantaneous. It can be better understood as though a global clock is present in which every write should be reflected in all processor caches by the end of that clock period. The next operation must happen only in the next clock period. 

In the following diagram, P means &quot;process&quot; and the global clock&#x27;s value is represented in the Sequence column. 
This is the most rigid model. In this model, the programmer&#x27;s expected result will be received every time. It is deterministic. Its practical relevance is restricted to a thought experiment and formalism, because instantaneous message exchange is impossible. It doesn&#x27;t help in answering the question of conflict resolution in concurrent writes to the same data item, because it assumes concurrent writes to be impossible.

=== Sequential consistency ===

The sequential consistency model was proposed by Lamport (1979). It is a weaker memory model than strict consistency model. A write to a variable does not have to be seen instantaneously, however, writes to variables by different processors have to be seen in the same order by all processors. Sequential consistency is met if &quot;the result of any execution is the same as if the (read and write) operations of all processes on the data store were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program.&quot; Adve and Gharachorloo, 1996 define two requirements to implement the sequential consistency; program order and write atomicity.
* Program order: Program order guarantees that each process issues a memory request ordered by its program.
* Write atomicity: Write atomicity defines that memory requests are serviced based on the order of a single FIFO queue.

In sequential consistency, there is no notion of time or most recent write operations. There are some operations interleaving that is the same for all processes. A process can see the write operations of all processes but it can just see its own read operations. Program order within each processor and sequential ordering of operations between processors should be maintained. In order to preserve sequential order of execution between processors, all operations must appear to execute instantaneously or atomically with respect to every other processor.

These operations need only &quot;appear&quot; to be completed because it is physically impossible to send information instantaneously. For instance, in a system utilizing a single globally shared bus, once a bus line is posted with information, it is guaranteed that all processors will see the information at the same instant. Thus, passing the information to the bus line completes the execution with respect to all processors and has appeared to have been executed. Cache-less architectures or cached architectures with interconnect networks that are not instantaneous can contain a slow path between processors and memories. These slow paths can result in sequential inconsistency, because some memories receive the broadcast data faster than others.

Sequential consistency can produce non-deterministic results. This is because the sequence of sequential operations between processors can be different during different runs of the program. All memory operations need to happen in the program order.

Linearizability (also known as atomic consistency or atomic memory) can be defined as sequential consistency with a real-time constraint, by considering a begin time and end time for each operation. An execution is linearizable if each operation taking place in linearizable order by placing a point between its begin time and its end time and guarantees sequential consistency.

Verifying sequential consistency through model checking is undecidable in general, even for finite-state cache coherence protocols.

=== Causal consistency ===

Causal consistency defined by Hutto and Ahamad, 1990, is a weakening of the sequential consistency model by categorizing events into those causally related and those that are not. It defines that only write operations that are causally related, need to be seen in the same order by all processes. For example, if an event b takes effect from an earlier event a, the causal consistency guarantees that all processes see event b after event a. Tanenbaum et al., 2007 provide a stricter definition, that a data store is considered causally consistent under the following conditions:

* Writes that are potentially causally related must be seen by all processes in the same order. 
* Concurrent writes may be seen in a different order on different machines.

This model relaxes sequential consistency on concurrent writes by a processor and on writes that are not causally related. Two writes can become causally related if one write to a variable is dependent on a previous write to any variable if the processor doing the second write has just read the first write. The two writes could have been done by the same processor or by different processors.

As in sequential consistency, reads do not need to reflect changes instantaneously, however, they need to reflect all changes to a variable sequentially. 
W(x)2 happens after W(x)1 due to the read made by P2 to x before W(x)2, hence this example is &quot;causally consistent&quot; under Hutto and Ahamad&#x27;s definition (although not under Tanenbaum et al.&#x27;s, because W(x)2 and W(x)3 are not seen in the same order for all processes). However R(x)2 and R(x)3 happen in a different order on P3 and P4, hence this example is &quot;sequentially inconsistent&quot;.

=== Processor consistency ===

In order for consistency in data to be maintained and to attain scalable processor systems where every processor has its own memory, the processor consistency model was derived. All processors need to be consistent in the order in which they see writes done by one processor and in the way they see writes by different processors to the same location (coherence is maintained). However, they do not need to be consistent when the writes are by different processors to different locations.

Every write operation can be divided into several sub-writes to all memories. A read from one such memory can happen before the write to this memory completes. Therefore, the data read can be stale. Thus, a processor under PC can execute a younger load when an older store needs to be stalled. Read before write, read after read and write before write ordering is still preserved in this model.

The processor consistency model is similar to the PRAM consistency model with a stronger condition that defines all writes to the same memory location must be seen in the same sequential order by all other processes. Processor consistency is weaker than sequential consistency but stronger than the PRAM consistency model.

The Stanford DASH multiprocessor system implements a variation of processor consistency which is incomparable (neither weaker nor stronger) to Goodman&#x27;s definitions. All processors need to be consistent in the order in which they see writes by one processor and in the way they see writes by different processors to the same location. However, they do not need to be consistent when the writes are by different processors to different locations.

=== Pipelined RAM consistency, or FIFO consistency ===

Pipelined RAM consistency (PRAM consistency) was presented by Lipton and Sandberg in 1988 as one of the first described consistency models. Due to its informal definition, there are in fact at least two subtly different implementations, one by Ahamad et al. and one by Mosberger.

In PRAM consistency, all processes view the operations of a single process in the same order that they were issued by that process, while operations issued by different processes can be viewed in different order from different processes. PRAM consistency is weaker than processor consistency. PRAM relaxes the need to maintain coherence to a location across all its processors. Here, reads to any variable can be executed before writes in a processor. Read before write, read after read and write before write ordering is still preserved in this model. 
=== Cache consistency ===
Cache consistency requires that all write operations to the same memory location are performed in some sequential order. Cache consistency is weaker than processor consistency and incomparable with PRAM consistency.

=== Slow consistency ===
In slow consistency, if a process reads a value previously written to a memory location, it cannot subsequently read any earlier value from that location. Writes performed by a process are immediately visible to that process. Slow consistency is a weaker model than PRAM and cache consistency.

Example:
Slow memory diagram depicts a slow consistency example. The first process writes 1 to the memory location X and then it writes 1 to the memory location Y. The second process reads 1 from Y and it then reads 0 from X even though X was written before Y.

Hutto, Phillip W., and Mustaque Ahamad (1990) illustrate that by appropriate programming, slow memory (consistency) can be expressive and efficient. They mention that slow memory has two valuable properties; locality and supporting reduction from atomic memory. They propose two algorithms to present the expressiveness of slow memory.

== Session guarantees ==

These 4 consistency models were proposed in a 1994 paper. They focus on guarantees in the situation where only a single user or application is making data modifications.

=== Monotonic read consistency ===
If a process reads the value of a data item x, any successive read operation on x by that process will always return that same value or a more recent value.

=== Monotonic write consistency ===

A write operation by a process on a data item X is completed before any successive write operation on X by the same process.

=== Read-your-writes consistency ===

A value written by a process on a data item X will always be available to a successive read operation performed by the same process on data item X.

=== Writes-follows-reads consistency ===

A write operation by a process on a data item x following a previous read operation on x by the same process is guaranteed to take place on the same or a more recent value of x that was read.

== Weak memory consistency models ==

The following models require specific synchronization by programmers.

=== Weak ordering ===

Weak ordering classifies memory operations into two categories: &quot;data operations&quot; and &quot;synchronization operations&quot;. To enforce program order, a programmer needs to find at least one synchronisation operation in a program. Synchronization operations signal the processor to make sure it has completed and seen all previous operations done by all processors. Program order and atomicity is maintained only on synchronisation operations and not on all reads and writes. This was derived from the understanding that certain memory operations – such as those conducted in a critical section - need not be seen by all processors until after all operations in the critical section are completed. It assumes reordering memory operations to data regions between synchronisation operations does not affect the outcome of the program. This exploits the fact that programs written to be executed on a multi-processor system contain the required synchronization to make sure that data races do not occur and SC outcomes are produced always.
Coherence is not relaxed in this model. Once these requirements are met, all other &quot;data&quot; operations can be reordered. The way this works is that a counter tracks the number of data operations and until this counter becomes zero, the synchronisation operation isn&#x27;t issued. Furthermore, no more data operations are issued unless all the previous synchronisations are completed. Memory operations in between two synchronisation variables can be overlapped and reordered without affecting the correctness of the program. This model ensures that write atomicity is always maintained, therefore no additional safety net is required for weak ordering.

In order to maintain weak ordering, write operations prior to a synchronization operation must be globally performed before the synchronization operation. Operations present after a synchronization operation should also be performed only after the synchronization operation completes. Therefore, accesses to synchronization variables is sequentially consistent and any read or write should be performed only after previous synchronization operations have completed.

There is high reliance on explicit synchronization in the program. For weak ordering models, the programmer must use atomic locking instructions such as test-and-set, fetch-and-op, store conditional, load linked or must label synchronization variables or use fences.

===Release consistency===
The release consistency model relaxes the weak consistency model by distinguishing the entrance synchronization operation from the exit synchronization operation. Under weak ordering, when a synchronization operation is to be seen, all operations in all processors need to be visible before the synchronization operation is done and the processor proceeds. However, under the release consistency model, during the entry to a critical section, termed as &quot;acquire&quot;, all operations with respect to the local memory variables need to be completed. During the exit, termed as &quot;release&quot;, all changes made by the local processor should be propagated to all other processors. Coherence is still maintained.

The acquire operation is a load/read that is performed to access the critical section. A release operation is a store/write performed to allow other processors to use the shared variables.

Among synchronization variables, sequential consistency or processor consistency can be maintained. Using SC, all competing synchronization variables should be processed in order. However, with PC, a pair of competing variables need to only follow this order. Younger acquires can be allowed to happen before older releases.

==== RCsc and RCpc ====

There are two types of release consistency, release consistency with sequential consistency (RCsc) and release consistency with processor consistency (RCpc). The latter type denotes which type of consistency is applied to those operations nominated below as special.

There are special (cf. ordinary) memory operations, themselves consisting of two classes of operations: &quot;sync&quot; or &quot;nsync&quot; operations. The latter are operations not used for synchronisation; the former are, and consist of &quot;acquire&quot; and &quot;release&quot; operations. An acquire is effectively a read memory operation used to obtain access to a certain set of shared locations. Release, on the other hand, is a write operation that is performed for granting permission to access the shared locations.

For sequential consistency (RCsc), the constraints are:
* acquire → all,
* all → release,
* special → special.

For processor consistency (RCpc) the write to read program order is relaxed, having constraints:
* acquire → all,
* all → release,
* special → special (except when special write is followed by special read).

Note: the above notation A → B, implies that if the operation A precedes B in the program order, then program order is enforced.

===Entry consistency ===
This is a variant of the release consistency model. It also requires the use of &quot;acquire&quot; and &quot;release&quot; instructions to explicitly state an entry or exit to a critical section. However, under entry consistency, every shared variable is assigned a synchronization variable specific to it. This way, only when the acquire is to variable x, all operations related to x need to be completed with respect to that processor. This allows concurrent operations of different critical sections of different shared variables to occur. Concurrency cannot be seen for critical operations on the same shared variable. Such a consistency model will be useful when different matrix elements can be processed at the same time.

=== Local consistency ===

In local consistency, each process performs its own operations in the order defined by its program. There is no constraint on the ordering in which the write operations of other processes appear to be performed. Local consistency is the weakest consistency model in shared memory systems.

=== General consistency ===

In general consistency, all the copies of a memory location are eventually identical after all processes&#x27; writes are completed.

=== Eventual consistency ===

An eventual consistency is a weak consistency model in a system with the lack of simultaneous updates. It defines that if no update takes a very long time, all replicas eventually become consistent.

Most shared decentralized databases have an eventual consistency model, either BASE: basically available; soft state; eventually consistent, or a combination of ACID and BASE sometimes called SALT: sequential; agreed; ledgered; tamper-resistant, and also symmetric; admin-free; ledgered; and time-consensual.

== Relaxed memory consistency models ==
Some different consistency models can be defined by relaxing one or more requirements in sequential consistency called relaxed consistency models. These consistency models do not provide memory consistency at the hardware level. In fact, the programmers are responsible for implementing the memory consistency by applying synchronization techniques. The above models are classified based on four criteria and are detailed further.

There are four comparisons to define the relaxed consistency:
; Relaxation: One way to categorize the relaxed consistency is to define which sequential consistency requirements are relaxed. We can have less strict models by relaxing either program order or write atomicity requirements defined by Adve and Gharachorloo, 1996. Program order guarantees that each process issues a memory request ordered by its program and write atomicity defines that memory requests are serviced based on the order of a single FIFO queue. In relaxing program order, any or all the ordering of operation pairs, write-after-write, read-after-write, or read/write-after-read, can be relaxed. In the relaxed write atomicity model, a process can view its own writes before any other processors.
; Synchronizing vs. non-synchronizing: A synchronizing model can be defined by dividing the memory accesses into two groups and assigning different consistency restrictions to each group considering that one group can have a weak consistency model while the other one needs a more restrictive consistency model. In contrast, a non-synchronizing model assigns the same consistency model to the memory access types.
; Issue vs. view-based: Issue method provides sequential consistency simulation by defining the restrictions for processes to issue memory operations. Whereas, view method describes the visibility restrictions on the events order for processes.
; Relative model strength: Some consistency models are more restrictive than others. In other words, strict consistency models enforce more constraints as consistency requirements. The strength of a model can be defined by the program order or atomicity relaxations and the strength of models can also be compared. Some models are directly related if they apply the same relaxations or more. On the other hand, the models that relax different requirements are not directly related.

Sequential consistency has two requirements, program order and write atomicity. Different relaxed consistency models can be obtained by relaxing these requirements. This is done so that, along with relaxed constraints, the performance increases, but the programmer is responsible for implementing the memory consistency by applying synchronisation techniques and must have a good understanding of the hardware.

Potential relaxations:
* Write to read program order
* Write to write program order
* Read to read and read to write program orders

=== Relaxed write to read ===

An approach to improving the performance at the hardware level is by relaxing the PO of a write followed by a read which effectively hides the latency of write operations. The optimisation this type of relaxation relies on is that it allows the subsequent reads to be in a relaxed order with respect to the previous writes from the processor. Because of this relaxation some programs like XXX may fail to give SC results because of this relaxation. Whereas, programs like YYY are still expected to give consistent results because of the enforcement of the remaining program order constraints.

Three models fall under this category. The IBM 370 model is the strictest model. A read can be complete before an earlier write to a different address, but it is prohibited from returning the value of the write unless all the processors have seen the write. The SPARC V8 total store ordering model (TSO) model partially relaxes the IBM 370 Model, it allows a read to return the value of its own processor&#x27;s write with respect to other writes to the same location i.e. it returns the value of its own write before others see it. Similar to the previous model, this cannot return the value of write unless all the processors have seen the write. The processor consistency model (PC) is the most relaxed of the three models and relaxes both the constraints such that a read can complete before an earlier write even before it is made visible to other processors.

In Example A, the result is possible only in IBM 370 because read(A) is not issued until the write(A) in that processor is completed. On the other hand, this result is possible in TSO and PC because they allow the reads of the flags before the writes of the flags in a single processor.

In Example B the result is possible only with PC as it allows P2 to return the value of a write even before it is visible to P3. This won&#x27;t be possible in the other two models.

To ensure sequential consistency in the above models, safety nets or fences are used to manually enforce the constraint. The IBM370 model has some specialised &quot;serialisation instructions&quot; which are manually placed between operations. These instructions can consist of memory instructions or non-memory instructions such as branches. On the other hand, the TSO and PC models do not provide safety nets, but the programmers can still use read-modify-write operations to make it appear like the program order is still maintained between a write and a following read. In case of TSO, PO appears to be maintained if the R or W which is already a part of a R-modify-W is replaced by a R-modify-W, this requires the W in the R-modify-W is a ‘dummy’ that returns the read value. Similarly for PC, PO seems to be maintained if the read is replaced by a write or is already a part of R-modify-W.

However, compiler optimisations cannot be done after exercising this relaxation alone. Compiler optimisations require the full flexibility of reordering any two operations in the PO, so the ability to reorder a write with respect to a read is not sufficiently helpful in this case.

=== Relaxed write to read and write to write ===

Some models relax the program order even further by relaxing even the ordering constraints between writes to different locations. The SPARC V8 partial store ordering model (PSO) is the only example of such a model. The ability to pipeline and overlap writes to different locations from the same processor is the key hardware optimisation enabled by PSO. PSO is similar to TSO in terms of atomicity requirements, in that it allows a processor to read the value of its own write and prevents other processors from reading another processor&#x27;s write before the write is visible to all other processors. Program order between two writes is maintained by PSO using an explicit STBAR instruction. The STBAR is inserted in a write buffer in implementations with FIFO write buffers. A counter is used to determine when all the writes before the STBAR instruction have been completed, which triggers a write to the memory system to increment the counter. A write acknowledgement decrements the counter, and when the counter becomes 0, it signifies that all the previous writes are completed.

In the examples A and B, PSO allows both these non-sequentially consistent results. The safety net that PSO provides is similar to TSO&#x27;s, it imposes program order from a write to a read and enforces write atomicity.

Similar to the previous models, the relaxations allowed by PSO are not sufficiently flexible to be useful for compiler optimisation, which requires a much more flexible optimisation.

=== Relaxing read and read to write program orders: Alpha, RMO, and PowerPC ===

In some models, all operations to different locations are relaxed. A read or write may be reordered with respect to a different read or write in a different location. The &quot;weak ordering&quot; may be classified under this category and two types of release consistency models (RCsc and RCpc) also come under this model. Three commercial architectures are also proposed under this category of relaxation: the Digital Alpha, SPARC V9 relaxed memory order (RMO), and IBM PowerPC models. 

These three commercial architectures exhibit explicit fence instructions as their safety nets. The Alpha model provides two types of fence instructions, &quot;memory barrier&quot; (MB) and &quot;write memory barrier&quot; (WMB). The MB operation can be used to maintain program order of any memory operation before the MB with a memory operation after the barrier. Similarly, the WMB maintains program order only among writes. The SPARC V9 RMO model provides a MEMBAR instruction which can be customised to order previous reads and writes with respect to future read and write operations. There is no need for using read-modify-writes to achieve this order because the MEMBAR instruction can be used to order a write with respect to a succeeding read. The PowerPC model uses a single fence instruction called the SYNC instruction. It is similar to the MB instruction, but with a little exception that reads can occur out of program order even if a SYNC is placed between two reads to the same location. This model also differs from Alpha and RMO in terms of atomicity. It allows a write to be seen earlier than a read&#x27;s completion. A combination of read modify write operations may be required to make an illusion of write atomicity.

RMO and PowerPC allow reordering of reads to the same location. These models violate sequential order in examples A and B. An additional relaxation allowed in these models is that memory operations following a read operation can be overlapped and reordered with respect to the read. Alpha and RMO allow a read to return the value of another processor&#x27;s early write. From a programmer&#x27;s perspective these models must maintain the illusion of write atomicity even though they allow the processor to read its own write early.

== Transactional memory models ==
Transactional memory model is the combination of cache coherency and memory consistency models as a communication model for shared memory systems supported by software or hardware; a transactional memory model provides both memory consistency and cache coherency. A transaction is a sequence of operations executed by a process that transforms data from one consistent state to another. A transaction either commits when there is no conflict or aborts. In commits, all changes are visible to all other processes when a transaction is completed, while aborts discard all changes. Compared to relaxed consistency models, a transactional model is easier to use and can provide higher performance than a sequential consistency model.

== Other consistency models ==

Some other consistency models are as follows:
* Causal+ consistency
* Cross-Client Monotonicity
* Delta consistency
* Fork consistency
* One-copy serializability
* Serializability
* Vector-field consistency
* Weak consistency
* Strong consistency

Several other consistency models have been conceived to express restrictions with respect to ordering or visibility of operations, or to deal with specific fault assumptions.

== Consistency and replication ==

Tanenbaum et al., 2007 defines two main reasons for replicating; reliability and performance. Reliability can be achieved in a replicated file system by switching to another replica in the case of the current replica failure. The replication also protects data from being corrupted by providing multiple copies of data on different replicas. It also improves the performance by dividing the work. While replication can improve performance and reliability, it can cause consistency problems between multiple copies of data. The multiple copies are consistent if a read operation returns the same value from all copies and a write operation as a single atomic operation (transaction) updates all copies before any other operation takes place. Tanenbaum, Andrew, &amp; Maarten Van Steen, 2007 refer to this type of consistency as tight consistency provided by synchronous replication. However, applying global synchronizations to keep all copies consistent is costly. One way to decrease the cost of global synchronization and improve the performance can be weakening the consistency restrictions.

=== Data-centric consistency models ===

Tanenbaum et al., 2007 defines the consistency model as a contract between the software (processes) and memory implementation (data store). This model guarantees that if the software follows certain rules, the memory works correctly. Since, in a system without a global clock, defining the last operation among writes is difficult, some restrictions can be applied on the values that can be returned by a read operation. The goal of data-centric consistency models is to provide a consistent view on a data store where processes may carry out concurrent updates.

==== Consistent ordering of operations ====
Some consistency models such as sequential and also causal consistency models deal with the order of operations on shared replicated data in order to provide consistency. In these models, all replicas must agree on a consistent global ordering of updates.

===== Grouping operations =====

In grouping operation, accesses to the synchronization variables are sequentially consistent. A process is allowed to access a synchronization variable that all previous writes have been completed. In other words, accesses to synchronization variables are not permitted until all operations on the synchronization variables are completely performed.

=== Client-centric consistency models ===

In distributed systems, maintaining sequential consistency in order to control the concurrent operations is essential. In some special data stores without simultaneous updates, client-centric consistency models can deal with inconsistencies in a less costly way. The following models are some client-centric consistency models:

=== Consistency protocols ===
The implementation of a consistency model is defined by a consistency protocol. Tanenbaum et al., 2007 illustrates some consistency protocols for data-centric models.

==== Continuous consistency ====

Continuous consistency introduced by Yu and Vahdat (2000). In this model, the consistency semantics of an application is described by using conits in the application. Since the consistency requirements can differ based on application semantics, Yu and Vahdat (2000) believe that a predefined uniform consistency model may not be an appropriate approach. The application should specify the consistency requirements that satisfy the application semantics. In this model, an application specifies each consistency requirement as a conit (abbreviation of consistency units). A conit can be a physical or logical consistency and is used to measure the consistency. Tanenbaum et al., 2007 describes the notion of a conit by giving an example.

There are three inconsistencies that can be tolerated by applications.

; Deviation in numerical values: Numerical deviation bounds the difference between the conit value and the relative value of the last update. A weight can be assigned to the writes which defines the importance of the writes in a specific application. The total weights of unseen writes for a conit can be defined as a numerical deviation in an application. There are two different types of numerical deviation; absolute and relative numerical deviation.
; Deviation in ordering: Ordering deviation is the discrepancy between the local order of writes in a replica and their relative ordering in the eventual final image. 
; Deviation in staleness between replicas: Staleness deviation defines the validity of the oldest write by bounding the difference between the current time and the time of the oldest write on a conit not seen locally. Each server has a local queue of uncertain write that is required an actual order to be determined and applied on a conit. The maximal length of uncertain writes queue is the bound of ordering deviation. When the number of writes exceeds the limit, instead of accepting new submitted write, the server will attempt to commit uncertain writes by communicating with other servers based on the order that writes should be executed.

If all three deviation bounds are set to zero, the continuous consistency model is the strong consistency.

==== Primary-based protocols ====


Primary-based protocols can be considered as a class of consistency protocols that are simpler to implement. For instance, sequential ordering is a popular consistency model when consistent ordering of operations is considered. The sequential ordering can be determined as primary-based protocol. In these protocols, there is an associated primary for each data item in a data store to coordinate write operations on that data item.

===== Remote-write protocols =====

In the simplest primary-based protocol that supports replication, also known as primary-backup protocol, write operations are forwarded to a single server and read operations can be performed locally.
: Example: Tanenbaum et al., 2007 gives an example of a primary-backup protocol. The diagram of primary-backup protocol shows an example of this protocol. When a client requests a write, the write request is forwarded to a primary server. The primary server sends request to backups to perform the update. The server then receives the update acknowledgement from all backups and sends the acknowledgement of completion of writes to the client. Any client can read the last available update locally. The trade-off of this protocol is that a client who sends the update request might have to wait so long to get the acknowledgement in order to continue. This problem can be solved by performing the updates locally, and then asking other backups to perform their updates. The non-blocking primary-backup protocol does not guarantee the consistency of update on all backup servers. However, it improves the performance. In the primary-backup protocol, all processes will see the same order of write operations since this protocol orders all incoming writes based on a globally unique time. Blocking protocols guarantee that processes view the result of the last write operation.

===== Local-write protocols =====

In primary-based local-write protocols, primary copy moves between processes willing to perform an update. To update a data item, a process first moves it to its location. As a result, in this approach, successive write operations can be performed locally while each process can read their local copy of data items. After the primary finishes its update, the update is forwarded to other replicas and all perform the update locally. This non-blocking approach can lead to an improvement.
The diagram of the local-write protocol depicts the local-write approach in primary-based protocols. A process requests a write operation in a data item x. The current server is considered as the new primary for a data item x. The write operation is performed and when the request is finished, the primary sends an update request to other backup servers. Each backup sends an acknowledgment to the primary after finishing the update operation.

==== Replicated-write protocols ====

In replicated-write protocols, unlike the primary-based protocol, all updates are carried out to all replicas.

===== Active replication =====

In active replication, there is a process associated with each replica to perform the write operation. In other words, updates are sent to each replica in the form of an operation in order to be executed. All updates need to be performed in the same order in all replicas. As a result, a totally-ordered multicast mechanism is required. There is a scalability issue in implementing such a multicasting mechanism in large distributed systems. There is another approach in which each operation is sent to a central coordinator (sequencer). The coordinator first assigns a sequence number to each operation and then forwards the operation to all replicas. Second approach cannot also solve the scalability problem.

===== Quorum-based protocols =====

Voting can be another approach in replicated-write protocols. In this approach, a client requests and receives permission from multiple servers in order to read and write a replicated data. As an example, suppose in a distributed file system, a file is replicated on N servers. To update a file, a client must send a request to at least in order to make their agreement to perform an update. After the agreement, changes are applied on the file and a new version number is assigned to the updated file. Similarly, for reading replicated file, a client sends a request to servers in order to receive the associated version number from those servers. Read operation is completed if all received version numbers are the most recent version.

===== Cache-coherence protocols =====

In a replicated file system, a cache-coherence protocol provides the cache consistency while caches are generally controlled by clients. In many approaches, cache consistency is provided by the underlying hardware. Some other approaches in middleware-based distributed systems apply software-based solutions to provide the cache consistency.

Cache consistency models can differ in their coherence detection strategies that define when inconsistencies occur. There are two approaches to detect the inconsistency; static and dynamic solutions. In the static solution, a compiler determines which variables can cause the cache inconsistency. So, the compiler enforces an instruction in order to avoid the inconsistency problem. In the dynamic solution, the server checks for inconsistencies at run time to control the consistency of the cached data that has changed after it was cached.

The coherence enforcement strategy is another cache-coherence protocol. It defines &quot;how&quot; to provide the consistency in caches by using the copies located on the server. One way to keep the data consistent is to never cache the shared data. A server can keep the data and apply some consistency protocol such as primary-based protocols to ensure the consistency of shared data. In this solution, only private data can be cached by clients. In the case that shared data is cached, there are two approaches in order to enforce the cache coherence.

In the first approach, when a shared data is updated, the server forwards invalidation to all caches. In the second approach, an update is propagated. Most caching systems apply these two approaches or dynamically choose between them.

<doc id="274524" wikidata="Q1472049" url="?curid=274524" title="Salisbury Plain">
<text>Salisbury Plain is a chalk plateau in southern England covering . It is part of a system of chalk downlands throughout eastern and southern England formed by the rocks of the Chalk Group and largely lies within the county of Wiltshire, but stretches into Hampshire.

The plain is famous for its rich archaeology, including Stonehenge, one of England&#x27;s best known landmarks. Large areas are given over to military training; thus, the sparsely populated plain is the biggest remaining area of calcareous grassland in northwest Europe. Additionally, the plain has arable land, and a few small areas of beech trees and coniferous woodland. Its highest point is Easton Hill.

A large amount of land is set aside for military use as Salisbury Plain Training Area.

==Physical geography==

The boundaries of Salisbury Plain have never been truly defined, and there is some difference of opinion as to its exact area. The river valleys surrounding it, and other downs and plains beyond them loosely define its boundaries. To the north the scarp of the downs overlooks the Vale of Pewsey, and to the northwest the Bristol Avon. The River Wylye runs along the southwest, and the Bourne runs to the east. 

The Hampshire Avon runs through the eastern half of the plain, and to the south the plain peters out as the river valleys close together before meeting at Salisbury. From here the Avon continues south to the English Channel at Christchurch. The Hampshire Downs and the Berkshire Downs are chalk downland to the east and north of Salisbury Plain, and the Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase are to the southwest. In the west and north west the geology is mainly the clays and limestones of the Blackmore Vale, Avon Vale and Vale of Wardour. The Mendip Hills rise to the west of Salisbury Plain, and the Cotswolds to the north west.

Amesbury is considered the largest settlement on the plain (southern fringes), though there are a number of small villages, such as Tilshead, Chitterne and Shrewton in the middle of the plain, as well as various hamlets and army camps. The A303 road runs through the southern area of the plain, while the A345 and the A360 cut across the centre.

20,000 hectares are designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Special Areas of Conservation, and the entire Salisbury Plain is a Special Protection Area for birds.

== History ==
Salisbury Plain is famous for its history and archaeology. In the Neolithic period, Stone Age people began to settle on the plain, most likely centred around the causewayed enclosure of Robin Hood&#x27;s Ball. Large long barrows such as White Barrow and other earthworks were built across the plain. By 2500 BC areas around Durrington Walls and Stonehenge had become a focus for building, and the southern part of the plain continued to be settled into the Bronze Age.

Around 600 BC, Iron Age hillforts came to be constructed around the boundaries of the plain, including Scratchbury Camp and Battlesbury Camp to the southwest, Bratton Camp to the northwest, Casterley Camp to the north, Yarnbury and Vespasian&#x27;s Camp to the south, and Sidbury Hill to the east.

Roman roads are visible features, probably serving a settlement near Old Sarum. Villas are sparse, however, and Anglo-Saxon place names suggest that the plain was mostly a grain-producing imperial estate.

In the 6th century, Anglo-Saxon incomers built planned settlements in the valleys surrounded by strip lynchets, with the downland left as sheep pasture. To the south is the city of Salisbury, whose medieval cathedral is famous for having the tallest spire in the country, and the building was, for many centuries, the tallest building in Britain. The cathedral is evidence of the prosperity the wool and cloth trade brought to the area. In the mid-19th century the wool and cloth industry began to decline, leading to a decline in the population and change in land use from sheep farming to agriculture and military use. Wiltshire became one of the poorest counties in England during this period of decline.

There are a number of chalk carvings on the plain, of which the most famous is the Westbury White Horse. The Kennet and Avon Canal was constructed to the north of the plain, through the Vale of Pewsey.

In September 1896, George Kemp and Guglielmo Marconi experimented with wireless telegraphy on Salisbury Plain, and achieved good results over a distance of .

The British Army first conducted manoeuvres at what is now Salisbury Plain Training Area in 1898.

==Ecology==

Because of the large training areas inaccessible to the public, the plain is a wildlife haven, and home to two national nature reserves, but there is concern that the low level of grazing on the plain could allow scrub to encroach on the grassland. The plain supports the largest known expanse of unimproved chalk downland in north west Europe, and represents 41% of Britain&#x27;s remaining area of this wildlife habitat. The plain supports 13 species of nationally rare and scarce plants, 67 species of rare and scarce invertebrates and forms a site of international importance for birds. In addition to chalk downland, the plain supports scrub and woodland habitats, temporary and permanent pools and the River Bourne.

===Vegetation===
A diversity of soil types, slope, aspect and past and present land-use has given rise to various grassland communities. Historical evidence suggests that large areas of grassland are of great antiquity, and areas which were cultivated at the beginning of the 20th century have experienced nearly 100 years of chalk grassland re-colonization. Parts of East Salisbury Plain and the periphery of Central and West comprise areas of grassland currently managed for grazing pasture and hay-cutting, whilst the middle of Centre and West are ungrazed. A large proportion of Salisbury Plain supports upright brome (&quot;Bromus erectus&quot;) species-rich grassland, within which a continuous floristic variation is seen. A widespread type on the plain is characterised by an abundance of red fescue (&quot;Festuca rubra&quot;), crested hair-grass (&quot;Koeleria macrantha&quot;), salad burnet (&quot;Sanguisorba minor&quot;), lady&#x27;s bedstraw (&quot;Galium verum&quot;), rough hawkbit (&quot;Leontodon hispidus&quot;), common rock-rose (&quot;Helianthemum nummularium&quot;) and dropwort (&quot;Filipendula vulgaris&quot;). The high constancy of this last species is a distinctive feature of the upright brome grasslands on Salisbury Plain and is otherwise only known from one other site in Hampshire. Where upright brome is less dominating, plants such as small scabiosa (&quot;Scabiosa columbaria&quot;), clustered bellflower (&quot;Campanula glomerata&quot;), dyer&#x27;s greenweed (&quot;Genista tinctoria&quot;), kidney vetch (&quot;Anthyllis vulneraria&quot;), sainfoin (&quot;Onobrychis viciifolia&quot;) and horseshoe vetch (&quot;Hippocrepis comosa&quot;) are characteristic associates.

The rare and notable plants which occur here include burnt-tip orchid (&quot;Neotinea ustulata&quot;), slender bedstraw (&quot;Galium pumilum&quot;), field fleawort (&quot;Senecio integrifolius&quot;) and the nationally scarce British endemic early gentian (&quot;Gentianella anglica&quot;). Particularly associated with long established turf on thin rendzina soils, and rabbit-grazed areas of the eastern and central ranges, are low-growing perennials including squinancy-wort (&quot;Asperula cynanchica&quot;), chalk milkwort (&quot;Polygala calcarea&quot;), dwarf thistle (&quot;Cirsium acaule&quot;), wild thyme (&quot;Thymus praecox&quot;), the nationally scarce bastard toadflax (&quot;Thesium humifusum&quot;) and purple milk-vetch (&quot;Astragalus danicus&quot;) in its most southerly British station.

Devil&#x27;s-bit scabious (&quot;Succisa pratensis&quot;), saw-wort (&quot;Serratula tinctoria&quot;) and betony (&quot;Stachys officinalis&quot;) are all abundant and exemplify the oceanic character of the chalk grassland on the plain, a feature which is confined to South West England. Similarly restricted is a community in which dwarf sedge &quot;Carex humilis&quot; forms a conspicuous component. This type of grassland has its stronghold in Wiltshire and occurs on the less disturbed areas of the central ranges. Herb diversity is generally lower in the tall, upright brome-dominated swards, but wild parsnip (&quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;), hogweed (&quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot;) and greater knapweed (&quot;Centaurea scabiosa&quot;) are characteristic. Parasitic on the latter species is knapweed broomrape (&quot;Orobanche elatior&quot;), occurring in greater quantity on the plain than anywhere else in Britain. False-oat grass (&quot;Arrhenatherum elatius&quot;) grassland is also widespread, but is particularly a feature of the western ranges, often indicating areas of past cultivation.

On anthills, and in the more disturbed turf that is especially a feature of the impact area, mouse-ear hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium pilosella&quot;) is abundant together with sheep&#x27;s fescue (&quot;Festuca ovina&quot;) and wild thyme. Annuals are also characteristic of this habitat, including common whitlowgrass (&quot;Erophila verna&quot;), rue-leaved saxifrage (&quot;Saxifraga tridactylites&quot;,) hairy rock-cress (&quot;Arabis hirsuta&quot;) and the nationally scarce dwarf mouse-ear (&quot;Cerastium pumilum&quot;) and fine-leaved sandwort (&quot;Minuartia hybrida&quot;). A very local community characterised by a lichen-rich turf (&quot;Cladonia&quot; species) and the broom moss (&quot;Dicranum scoparium&quot;) is found in some stabilised missile-impaction craters on the central ranges. This vegetation type is found elsewhere only on Porton Down SSSI and on the Brecklands.

Small areas of chalk-heath vegetation occur on superficial clay-with-flints deposits. Here chalk-loving plants such as salad burnet (&quot;Sanguisorba minor&quot;) and dropwort co-exist with plants typical of acid soils, including gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;), heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;) and the uncommon annual knawel (&quot;Scleranthus annuus&quot;). Two Red Data Book (RDB) plants occur on the plain. The largest population in Britain of tuberous thistle (&quot;Cirsium tuberosum&quot;) occurs on the western ranges and is notable for the low incidence of hybridisation with dwarf thistle, a contributory cause of its decline in other localities. Meadow clary (&quot;Salvia pratensis&quot;) persists as a small colony in tall upright brome grassland.

Salisbury Plain supports a diverse bryophyte flora with seven nationally scarce species which have seen a general decline in other chalk grassland sites, including &quot;Barbula acuta&quot;, &quot;Phascum curvicolle&quot;, &quot;Pleurochaete squarrosa&quot;, &quot;Thuidium abietinum&quot; and &quot;Weissia sterilis&quot;.

Although there is some scrub development on the plain, it is remarkable that large expanses of the chalk grassland remain open with very little invasion of woody species. Of particular interest are the large stands of juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;) on Bulford Downs and Beacon Hill. Both pyramidal and prostrate forms are present and this site, along with Porton Down SSSI to the south, supports the best remaining examples of the lowland type of juniper associated with chalk and mixed scrub in England.

===Insects===
The botanically and structurally diverse grasslands support a large range of rare and uncommon chalk downland invertebrates. Where abundance has been assessed strong populations of national and local importance are present, and the large area of habitat available to them is important in ensuring their survival.
====Butterflies====
The plain is an important stronghold for declining downland butterflies. A high concentration of colonies of three nationally scarce species, the Adonis blue (&quot;Polyommatus bellargus&quot;), Duke of Burgundy (&quot;Hamearis lucina&quot;), and the largest population of marsh fritillary (&quot;Euphydryas aurinia&quot;) on the chalk, occur. A colony of brown hairstreak (&quot;Thecla betulae&quot;) is present on East Salisbury Plain at one of its two Wiltshire localities. Strong populations of other downland species such as chalkhill blue (&quot;Polyommatus coridon&quot;) and dark green fritillary (&quot;Argynnis aglaja&quot;) are found, and of note here is the occurrence of grayling (&quot;Hipparchia semele&quot;), a butterfly rarely found away from the coast.

====Moths====
An outstanding assemblage of two rare (RDB), 36 nationally scarce and two regionally notable moths are present, most of which are either chalk grassland specialists or are partly dependent on chalk grassland. The RDB species scarce forester (&quot;Adscita globulariae&quot;) is present, and amongst many species of nationally scarce moths are the cistus forester (&quot;Adscita geryon&quot;), six-belted clearwing (&quot;Bembecia scopigera&quot;), oblique striped (&quot;Phibalapteryx virgata&quot;), pimpernel pug (&quot;Eupithecia pimpinellata&quot;), shaded pug (&quot;Eupithecia subumbrata&quot;) and narrow-bordered bee hawk moth (&quot;Hemaris tityus&quot;). Larvae of these moths feed on the chalk grassland plants which are widespread on the plain. Other nationally scarce moths such as orange-tailed clearwing (&quot;Synanthedon anthraciniformis&quot;) depend on the associated scrub habitats.
====Bees====
The bee fauna is particularly rich in species which depend on chalk grassland. One of only two British populations of the endangered (RDB) mining bee &quot;Melitta dimidiata&quot; is present on the plain, and two other RDB species which occur are &quot;Andrena hattorfiana&quot; and its nest parasite the cuckoo bee &quot;Nomada armata&quot;. This is a rare inland site for the nationally scarce brown-banded carder bee (&quot;Bombus humilis&quot;), and the only lowland English site for the broken-belted bumblebee (&quot;Bombus soroeensis&quot;).

====Flies====
The Diptera (flies) include four RDB species which depend on chalk grassland, the picture-wing flies &quot;Chaetorellia loricata&quot;, &quot;Urophora solstitialis&quot; and &quot;Terellia vectensis&quot; and the hover fly &quot;Volucella inflata&quot;.
====Crustaceans====
Recent observations have shown that Salisbury Plain is an important site for the RDB crustacean, the fairy shrimp &quot;Chirocephalus diaphanus&quot; which is dependent on temporary pools, a rare and declining habitat. On the plain this habitat requirement is met by numerous pools created by repeated tank movements along the earth tracks which cross the chalk grassland.

====Others====
Other nationally scarce invertebrates occur within the Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets), Heteroptera (bugs) and Coleoptera (beetles), the latter group including a RDB soldier beetle, &quot;Cantharis fusca&quot;.

===Birds===
The area as a whole is of national and international importance for breeding and wintering birds. It supports seven species listed on Annex 1 of the EC Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds, populations of six species of Red Data bird and several species of candidate Red Data bird. Amongst the breeding birds three species are particularly noteworthy. Up to 20 pairs of stone-curlew representing 12% of the British population breed on the plain. The area accounts for approximately 20% of breeding records for quail in Britain each year, and numbers of breeding hobby are thought to exceed 1% of the British population on a regular basis. Other important breeding species include common buzzard, barn owl, long-eared owl, nightingale, stonechat, whinchat, wheatear, corn bunting and, on occasion, Montagu&#x27;s harrier.

The overall breeding assemblage is exceptionally diverse for a British dry grassland site. In winter the plain is an important area for foraging flocks of thrushes, finches and buntings. These, together with abundant small mammals are prey for wintering hen harrier, merlin and short-eared owl. Hen harriers occur in nationally significant numbers each winter, and the plain is an important winter roost for this species in southern England.
In 2003 the great bustard was reintroduced into Britain on Salisbury Plain.

===Snakes and amphibians===
Other species of interest on Salisbury Plain include the great crested newt (&quot;Triturus cristatus&quot;). This newt occurs in dew ponds across the plain and in pools along the Bourne River, together with smooth newt (&quot;Triturus vulgaris&quot;), common frog (&quot;Rana temporia&quot;) and common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;). Barred grass snake (&quot;Natrix helvetica&quot;) are also often seen near pools, and common lizard (&quot;Lacerta vivipara&quot;), slowworm (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;) and adder (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;) are present.
== In popular culture ==
The folk song Roud 1487 is titled &quot;Salisbury Plain&quot;. The song appears on Martin Carthy&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Prince Heathen&quot;.

<doc id="274525" wikidata="Q185858" url="?curid=274525" title="Franco-Flemish School">
<text>The designation Franco-Flemish School, also called Netherlandish School, Burgundian School, Low Countries School, Flemish School, Dutch School, or Northern School, refers to the style of polyphonic vocal music composition originating from France and from the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th and 16th centuries as well as to the composers who wrote it. The spread of their technique, especially after the revolutionary development of printing, produced the first true international style since the unification of Gregorian chant in the 9th century. Franco-Flemish composers mainly wrote sacred music, primarily masses, motets, and hymns.

==Term and controversy==
Several generations of Renaissance composers from the region loosely known as the Low Countries (Imperial and French fiefs ruled in personal union by the House of Valois-Burgundy in the period from 1384 to 1482)—i.e. present-day Northern France, Belgium and the Southern Netherlands—are grouped under &quot;Franco-Flemish School&quot;, though a teacher-student-relationship between them rarely existed. Most of these musicians were born in the thriving Burgundian provinces of Artois, Flanders, Brabant, Hainaut, or Limburg. Others were born in Northern and Southern France, like Guillaume Faugues, Simone de Bonefont and Antoine Brumel who was one of the most influential composers of his generation. During periods of political and economic stability, the courts of the Burgundian dukes were a centre of cultural activity in Europe.

Franco-Flemish composers had their origins in ecclesiastical choir schools such as at the cathedrals and collegiate churches of Saint-Quentin, Arras, Valenciennes, Douai, Bourges, Liège, Tournai, Cambrai, Mons, Antwerp, Bruges, and Ghent, although they were famous for working elsewhere. Numerous musicians established themselves in French court or moved to the European courts in Italy where they were called &quot;I fiamminghi&quot; or Oltremontani (&quot;those from over the Alps&quot;) and Spain—notably in the Flemish chapel (capilla flamenca) of the Habsburgs, or to towns in Germany, and other parts of Europe—Poland, the Czech lands, Austria, Hungary, England, Sweden, Denmark, Saxony—carrying their styles with them. The exact centres shifted during this time, and by the end of the sixteenth century the focal point of the Western musical world had moved from the Low Countries to Italy.

To conclude, let us recall that the expression &quot;Franco-Flemish&quot; and the more biased one of &quot;Dutch school&quot; are still controversial among musicologists. They were not in use at that time and seem to cover only part of the linguistic, political, territorial and historical reality.

==Development==
Following are five groups, or generations, that are sometimes distinguished in the Franco-Flemish/Netherlandish school. Development of this musical style was continuous, and these generations only provide useful reference points.

* The &quot;First generation&quot; (1420–1450), dominated by Jean Tapissier, Guillaume Du Fay, Gilles Binchois and Antoine Busnois; this group of composers is most often known as the Burgundian School. The origins of the style of the &quot;first generation&quot; embraces both earlier Burgundian traditions and also Italian and English styles. For example, in 1442, the poet Martin le Franc praised Binchois and Dufay for following Dunstaple in adopting the &quot;contenance angloise&quot; (&quot;English character&quot;).
* The &quot;Second generation&quot; (1450–1485), with Ockeghem as its main exponent, others including Orto, Compère, Prioris, Agricola, Caron, Faugues, Regis and Tinctoris.
* The &quot;Third generation&quot; (1480–1520): Jean Mouton, Obrecht, de la Rue, Isaac, Brumel, Févin, Pipelare, Richafort, Divitis, and most significantly Josquin des Prez.
* The &quot;Fourth generation&quot; (1520–1560): Gombert, Phinot, Crecquillon, Manchicourt, Arcadelt, Rore, Willaert, Courtois, Clemens non Papa and Bonefont.
* The &quot;Fifth generation&quot; (1560–1615/20): Lassus, de Monte, Vaet, Regnart, Luython, Wert, de Macque, Claude Goudimel and Rogier. By this time, many of the composers of polyphonic music were native to Italy and other countries: the Netherlandish style had naturalized on foreign soil, and become a true European style.

==The Franco-Flemish motet==

Composed between 1450 and 1520, these motets were typically written for four voices, with all voices being equal. They often exhibit thick, dark textures, with an extended low range. The most notable composers of this style include Ockeghem and Josquin, whose &quot;De profundis clamavi ad te&quot;, composed between 1500 and 1521, provides a good example.

<doc id="274531" wikidata="Q861982" url="?curid=274531" title="Bill Bright">
<text>William R. Bright (October 19, 1921 – July 19, 2003) was an American evangelist. In 1951 at the University of California, Los Angeles, he founded Campus Crusade for Christ as a ministry for university students. In 1952 he wrote The Four Spiritual Laws. In 1979 he produced the film &quot;Jesus&quot;.

In 1996 Bill Bright was awarded the $1.1 million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, and donated the money to promote the spiritual benefits of fasting and prayer. In 2001 he stepped down as leader of the organization and Steve Douglass became president. He died in 2003.

==Early life and education==
Bill Bright was born in Coweta, Oklahoma, on October 19, 1921. He was the sixth child and fifth son of Forrest Dale and Mary Lee Rohl Bright. His father Forrest Dale was a cattle rancher while his mother Mary Lee was a school teacher prior to marrying Forrest. Bill&#x27;s father Forrest was actively involved in the Oklahoma Republican Party with Bill remaining a staunch Republican throughout his life. Bill studied economics at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. As a student at Northeastern State University, he was initiated into the Zeta chapter of the Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity, and has subsequently been granted honorable alumnus status to the Alpha Gamma Omega Christ-Centered Fraternity. In 1942, Bill enlisted in the United States Navy Reserve but did not see combat service due to a burst eardrum from playing football during high school.
While in his early 20s he moved to Los Angeles, California, and founded a company called &quot;Bright&#x27;s California Confections.&quot; During the 1940s, Bill attended the First Presbyterian Church, Hollywood where he became an evangelical Christian. Bright was influenced by Henrietta Mears, who served as the Director of Christian Education at First Presbyterian Church, and Billy Graham, who later became a prominent American evangelical leader.

In 1946, Bill Bright quit his candy business to pursue Biblical studies and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary and Fuller Theological Seminary. According to the historian John G. Turner, Bright struggled with his academic studies and did not complete his degree at either institution. While studying at Fuller seminary, Bright felt what he regarded as the call of God to reach out to university students and abandoned his academic studies. Before starting his campus ministry, Bright sold off his confections company and settled a financial dispute with his former business partners, the Taylor family. 

==Family==

Bill Bright married Vonette Bright on December 30, 1948. The two had been engaged to marry since the spring of 1946. However, Bill at the prompting of Zachary&#x27;s parents agreed to delay the wedding until her impending 1948 graduation from Texas State College for Women. During the 1950s, Bill and Vonette adopted two boys named Brad and Zachary Bright.

==Ministry career==

===Writings===
In 1965, Bright wrote &quot;The Four Spiritual Laws&quot;, an evangelistic Christian tract. In the booklet he outlines his view of the essentials of the Christian faith concerning salvation. It is summarized as four spiritual laws or principles that govern what he sees as human beings&#x27; relationship with God. The booklet ends with a prayer of repentance.

===Creation of Campus Crusade for Christ, early 1950s===
Bright had initially planned to produce an evangelical film called &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; but abandoned the project due to a lack of funding.

Though Bright had initially considered partnering with other churches, his disenchantment with their ability to mentor new Christian converts led him to start Campus Crusade for Christ as a parachurch organization. In 1951, after recruiting several volunteers from Fuller Seminary and Hollywood Presbyterian, Bright started Campus Crusade&#x27;s first chapter at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). According to Turner, Campus Crusade was also inspired by Bright&#x27;s desire to combat Communist influence in US universities including UCLA, which was then regarded as a hotbed of student radicalism.

By 1952, Bright&#x27;s Campus Crusade had reportedly converted 250 students at UCLA including the student body president, campus newspaper editor, and several athletes including African American decathlete and future Olympian Rafer Johnson. While Bill and his colleagues focused on the male students, Vonette focused on reaching out to the female students.

In 1953, Campus Crusade established its headquarters in Los Angeles&#x27; Westwood Boulevard. Bright&#x27;s campus outreach was also aided by his Hollywood Presbyterian mentor Henrietta Mears, who allowed the Brights to share her Bel Air home and spoke at several Crusade functions.

===Expansion of Campus Crusade beyond UCLA===
Bright&#x27;s success at UCLA led him to establish Campus Crusade branches at several other US universities.

Campus Crusade&#x27;s expansion across several US campuses created friction with other Christian campus groups including InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and liberal campus chaplains, who disagreed with the evangelistic tone of Bright&#x27;s ministry. In 1956, Bright wrote a 20–minute evangelistic presentation called &quot;God&#x27;s Plan for Your Life&quot;, which set the tone for Campus Crusade&#x27;s evangelism and discipleship program. Bright also initially partnered with the fundamentalist Bob Jones University. However, the relationship deteriorated after Bright sided with Billy Graham, who had accepted the sponsorship of liberal Protestants for his 1957 New York crusade. In response, Bob Jones Sr. and his son Bob Jones Jr. severed relations with Bright&#x27;s ministry. According to Turner, this split with Bob Jones University led Bright to gravitate towards the &quot;new evangelical&quot; wing of the Protestant movement, which was associated with Billy Graham&#x27;s cooperative evangelism. 

In 2011 Campus Crusade for Christ had 25,000 missionaries in 191 countries.

==Later life==
Bright held five honorary doctorate degrees: a Doctor of Laws from the Jeonbuk National University of Korea, a Doctor of Divinity from John Brown University, a Doctor of Letters from Houghton Seminary, a Doctor of Divinity from the Los Angeles Bible College and Seminary, and a Doctor of Laws from Pepperdine University.

In 1975, along with fellow evangelist Loren Cunningham (founder of Youth With a Mission) and theologian Francis Schaeffer, Bright was one of the founders of what would later be termed the Seven Mountain Mandate. The idea would later go on to be popularized by Bethel Church pastor Bill Johnson and Lance Wallnau, among others. The concept centers around Christians taking dominion of seven societal spheres of influence: &quot;family, religion, education, media, art, economics, and government.&quot;

In 1983, he chaired the National Committee for the National Year of the Bible. He was named the 1996 recipient of the $1.1 million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion.

He wrote more than 100 books and booklets, and thousands of articles and pamphlets. He endorsed the document Evangelicals and Catholics Together.

Bright was a co-founder of the Alliance Defense Fund, which funds high-profile litigation cases on behalf of Christians&#x27; First Amendment rights. He was a co-signatory of the Land letter of 2002 which outlined a just war rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, providing a theological underpinning for the invasion being planned by President George W. Bush.

He produced the film &quot;Jesus&quot; in 1979, which was released by Warner Bros. in the United States. It was not a financial success, losing approximately $2 million.

In 1988 he led the protest against the Martin Scorsese film &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and he called the film &quot;blasphemous&quot;. He offered to buy the film&#x27;s negative from Universal in order to destroy it.

==Death==
Bright died on July 19, 2003, in Orlando, Florida. His wife died in 2015.

==Politics==
Bill Bright&#x27;s father Dale Bright was a staunch Republican who served as the chairman of the Wagoner Country Republican Party. Like his father, Bill remained a staunch Republican supporter and voter throughout his life. As an evangelical Christian, Bright was also anti-Communist and stated that one of his reasons for starting Campus Crusade was to combat Communist influence in US universities. During the 1970s, Bright defended the South Korean President Park Chung Hee, who imposed martial law and assumed dictatorial powers. He claimed that Park was fighting against Communism and supported religious freedom.

<text>Carlos Enrique Hernández Ramos (April 21, 1940 – July 2, 2016) was a Venezuelan world champion professional boxer. Known professionally as Carlos Morocho Hernandez (Carlos &quot;Dark Haired&quot; or, possibly, &quot;Twin&quot; Hernandez), he ended his career following a TKO by Scottish boxer Ken Buchanan.

==History ==
Carlos Enrique Hernandez Ramos was born on 21 April 1940, in the populous parish of La Pastora, Caracas. For the peculiarity of being dark-haired, was identified for most of his career as &quot;Morocho&quot;, but also was known as &quot;Kid Helicoide&quot;. His first triumphs in boxing came at the age of 15 years old, earning the titles of Champion of the Federal District and National Featherweight monarch. In his first international tournament, he was included in the Second World Amateur Boxing Championships held in Mexico, where he earned the &quot;Ring of Diamonds&quot;.

He was also champion of Central America and the Caribbean and was undefeated after 25 amateur fights. Following his amateur career, which he finished undefeated, he tried his hand at professional boxing, which seemed a more lucrative field to him.

The &quot;Morocho&quot; made the leap to professional boxing under the tutelage of Juancho Medina. His debut was on 25 January 1959 at Nuevo Circo de Caracas, against Felix Gil, at featherweight. On 18 January 1965, Carlos &quot;Morocho&quot; Hernández won the world light-welterweight championship, facing the American Eddie Perkins and giving Venezuela its first world champion.

After a career of successes and excesses, Carlos &quot;Morocho&quot; Hernández, met the end and defeat when he faced, in London, on 11 May 1971 Scotsman Ken Buchanan, to whom Hernandez lost by TKO in the eighth round.

==Death==
Carlos &quot;Morocho&quot; Hernandez&quot; died in Caracas, Venezuela, on July 2, 2016, due to health complications.

<text>In probability theory, a martingale is a sequence of random variables (i.e., a stochastic process) for which, at a particular time, the conditional expectation of the next value in the sequence is equal to the present value, regardless of all prior values.
==History==
Originally, &quot;martingale&quot; referred to a class of betting strategies that was popular in 18th-century France. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins their stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double their bet after every loss so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. As the gambler&#x27;s wealth and available time jointly approach infinity, their probability of eventually flipping heads approaches 1, which makes the martingale betting strategy seem like a sure thing. However, the exponential growth of the bets eventually bankrupts its users due to finite bankrolls. Stopped Brownian motion, which is a martingale process, can be used to model the trajectory of such games.

The concept of martingale in probability theory was introduced by Paul Lévy in 1934, though he did not name it. The term &quot;martingale&quot; was introduced later by , who also extended the definition to continuous martingales. Much of the original development of the theory was done by Joseph Leo Doob among others. Part of the motivation for that work was to show the impossibility of successful betting strategies in games of chance.

==Definitions==
A basic definition of a discrete-time martingale is a discrete-time stochastic process (i.e., a sequence of random variables) &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ... that satisfies for any time &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_1

:formula_2

That is, the conditional expected value of the next observation, given all the past observations, is equal to the most recent observation.

===Martingale sequences with respect to another sequence===

More generally, a sequence &quot;Y&quot;1, &quot;Y&quot;2, &quot;Y&quot;3 ... is said to be a martingale with respect to another sequence &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3 ... if for all &quot;n&quot;

:formula_3

:formula_4

Similarly, a continuous-time martingale with respect to the stochastic process &quot;Xt&quot; is a stochastic process &quot;Yt&quot; such that for all &quot;t&quot;

:formula_5

:formula_6

This expresses the property that the conditional expectation of an observation at time &quot;t&quot;, given all the observations up to time formula_7, is equal to the observation at time &quot;s&quot; (of course, provided that &quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;). The second property implies that formula_8 is measurable with respect to formula_9.

===General definition===

In full generality, a stochastic process formula_10 taking values in a Banach space formula_11 with norm formula_12 is a martingale with respect to a filtration formula_13 and probability measure formula_14 if
* Σ∗ is a filtration of the underlying probability space (Ω, Σ, formula_14);
* &quot;Y&quot; is adapted to the filtration Σ∗, i.e., for each &quot;t&quot; in the index set &quot;T&quot;, the random variable &quot;Yt&quot; is a Σ&quot;t&quot;-measurable function;
* for each &quot;t&quot;, &quot;Yt&quot; lies in the &quot;Lp&quot; space &quot;L&quot;1(Ω, Σ&quot;t&quot;, formula_14; &quot;S&quot;), i.e.
::formula_17
* for all &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; with &quot;s&quot; &lt; &quot;t&quot; and all &quot;F&quot; ∈ Σ&quot;s&quot;,
::formula_18
:where &quot;χF&quot; denotes the indicator function of the event &quot;F&quot;. In Grimmett and Stirzaker&#x27;s &quot;Probability and Random Processes&quot;, this last condition is denoted as
::formula_19
:which is a general form of conditional expectation.

It is important to note that the property of being a martingale involves both the filtration &quot;and&quot; the probability measure (with respect to which the expectations are taken). It is possible that &quot;Y&quot; could be a martingale with respect to one measure but not another one; the Girsanov theorem offers a way to find a measure with respect to which an Itō process is a martingale.

In the Banach space setting the conditional expectation is also denoted in operator notation as formula_20.

==Examples of martingales==
* An unbiased random walk, in any number of dimensions, is an example of a martingale. For example, consider a 1-dimensional random walk where at each time step a move to the right or left is equally likely. 
* A gambler&#x27;s fortune (capital) is a martingale if all the betting games which the gambler plays are fair. The gambler is playing a game of coin flipping. Suppose &quot;Xn&quot; is the gambler&#x27;s fortune after &quot;n&quot; tosses of a fair coin, such that the gambler wins $1 if the coin toss outcome is heads and loses $1 if the coin toss outcome is tails. The gambler&#x27;s conditional expected fortune after the next game, given the history, is equal to his present fortune. This sequence is thus a martingale.
* Let &quot;Yn&quot; = &quot;Xn&quot;2 − &quot;n&quot; where &quot;Xn&quot; is the gambler&#x27;s fortune from the prior example. Then the sequence {&quot;Yn&quot; : &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... } is a martingale. This can be used to show that the gambler&#x27;s total gain or loss varies roughly between plus or minus the square root of the number of games of coin flipping played.
* de Moivre&#x27;s martingale: Suppose the coin toss outcomes are unfair, i.e., biased, with probability &quot;p&quot; of coming up heads and probability &quot;q&quot; = 1 − &quot;p&quot; of tails. Let

::formula_21
:with &quot;+&quot; in case of &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;−&quot; in case of &quot;tails&quot;. Let

::formula_22

:Then {&quot;Yn&quot; : &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... } is a martingale with respect to {&quot;Xn&quot; : &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... }. To show this
::formula_23
* Pólya&#x27;s urn contains a number of different-coloured marbles; at each iteration a marble is randomly selected from the urn and replaced with several more of that same colour. For any given colour, the fraction of marbles in the urn with that colour is a martingale. For example, if currently 95% of the marbles are red then, though the next iteration is more likely to add red marbles than another color, this bias is exactly balanced out by the fact that adding more red marbles alters the fraction much less significantly than adding the same number of non-red marbles would.
* Likelihood-ratio testing in statistics: A random variable &quot;X&quot; is thought to be distributed according either to probability density &quot;f&quot; or to a different probability density &quot;g&quot;. A random sample &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; is taken. Let &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the &quot;likelihood ratio&quot;

::formula_24

: If X is actually distributed according to the density &quot;f&quot; rather than according to &quot;g&quot;, then {&quot;Yn&quot; :&quot;n&quot;=1, 2, 3...} is a martingale with respect to {&quot;Xn&quot; :&quot;n&quot;=1, 2, 3, ...}
* In an ecological community, i.e. a group of species that are in a particular trophic level, competing for similar resources in a local area, the number of individuals of any particular species of fixed size is a function of (discrete) time, and may be viewed as a sequence of random variables. This sequence is a martingale under the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography.
* If { &quot;Nt&quot; : &quot;t&quot; ≥ 0 } is a Poisson process with intensity &quot;λ&quot;, then the compensated Poisson process { &quot;Nt&quot; − &quot;λt&quot; : &quot;t&quot; ≥ 0 } is a continuous-time martingale with right-continuous/left-limit sample paths.
* Wald&#x27;s martingale
* A formula_25-dimensional process formula_26 in some space formula_27 is a martingale in formula_27 if each component formula_29 is a one-dimensional martingale in formula_11.

==Submartingales, supermartingales, and relationship to harmonic functions==

There are two generalizations of a martingale that also include cases when the current observation &quot;Xn&quot; is not necessarily equal to the future conditional expectation &quot;E&quot;[&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 | &quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;] but instead an upper or lower bound on the conditional expectation. These generalizations reflect the relationship between martingale theory and potential theory, that is, the study of harmonic functions. Just as a continuous-time martingale satisfies E[&quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; | {&quot;X&quot;&quot;τ&quot; : &quot;τ&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;}] − &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; = 0 ∀&quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;, a harmonic function &quot;f&quot; satisfies the partial differential equation Δ&quot;f&quot; = 0 where Δ is the Laplacian operator. Given a Brownian motion process &quot;W&quot;&quot;t&quot; and a harmonic function &quot;f&quot;, the resulting process &quot;f&quot;(&quot;W&quot;&quot;t&quot;) is also a martingale.
* A discrete-time submartingale is a sequence formula_31 of integrable random variables satisfying
::formula_32
: Likewise, a continuous-time submartingale satisfies
::formula_33
:In potential theory, a subharmonic function &quot;f&quot; satisfies Δ&quot;f&quot; ≥ 0. Any subharmonic function that is bounded above by a harmonic function for all points on the boundary of a ball is bounded above by the harmonic function for all points inside the ball. Similarly, if a submartingale and a martingale have equivalent expectations for a given time, the history of the submartingale tends to be bounded above by the history of the martingale. Roughly speaking, the prefix &quot;sub-&quot; is consistent because the current observation &quot;Xn&quot; is &quot;less than&quot; (or equal to) the conditional expectation &quot;E&quot;[&quot;Xn&quot;+1 | &quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;]. Consequently, the current observation provides support &quot;from below&quot; the future conditional expectation, and the process tends to increase in future time.
* Analogously, a discrete-time supermartingale satisfies
::formula_34
: Likewise, a continuous-time supermartingale satisfies
::formula_35
:In potential theory, a superharmonic function &quot;f&quot; satisfies Δ&quot;f&quot; ≤ 0. Any superharmonic function that is bounded below by a harmonic function for all points on the boundary of a ball is bounded below by the harmonic function for all points inside the ball. Similarly, if a supermartingale and a martingale have equivalent expectations for a given time, the history of the supermartingale tends to be bounded below by the history of the martingale. Roughly speaking, the prefix &quot;super-&quot; is consistent because the current observation &quot;Xn&quot; is &quot;greater than&quot; (or equal to) the conditional expectation &quot;E&quot;[&quot;Xn&quot;+1 | &quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;]. Consequently, the current observation provides support &quot;from above&quot; the future conditional expectation, and the process tends to decrease in future time.

===Examples of submartingales and supermartingales===
* Every martingale is also a submartingale and a supermartingale. Conversely, any stochastic process that is &quot;both&quot; a submartingale and a supermartingale is a martingale.
* Consider again the gambler who wins $1 when a coin comes up heads and loses $1 when the coin comes up tails. Suppose now that the coin may be biased, so that it comes up heads with probability &quot;p&quot;.
** If &quot;p&quot; is equal to 1/2, the gambler on average neither wins nor loses money, and the gambler&#x27;s fortune over time is a martingale.
** If &quot;p&quot; is less than 1/2, the gambler loses money on average, and the gambler&#x27;s fortune over time is a supermartingale.
** If &quot;p&quot; is greater than 1/2, the gambler wins money on average, and the gambler&#x27;s fortune over time is a submartingale.
* A convex function of a martingale is a submartingale, by Jensen&#x27;s inequality. For example, the square of the gambler&#x27;s fortune in the fair coin game is a submartingale (which also follows from the fact that &quot;Xn&quot;2 − &quot;n&quot; is a martingale). Similarly, a concave function of a martingale is a supermartingale.

==Martingales and stopping times==
A stopping time with respect to a sequence of random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ... is a random variable τ with the property that for each &quot;t&quot;, the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event &quot;τ&quot; = &quot;t&quot; depends only on the values of &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot;. The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time &quot;t&quot;, you can look at the sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop. An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the gambling table, which might be a function of their previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can&#x27;t choose to go or stay based on the outcome of games that haven&#x27;t been played yet.

In some contexts the concept of &quot;stopping time&quot; is defined by requiring only that the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event &quot;τ&quot; = &quot;t&quot; is probabilistically independent of &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; + 1, &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; + 2, ... but not that it is completely determined by the history of the process up to time &quot;t&quot;. That is a weaker condition than the one appearing in the paragraph above, but is strong enough to serve in some of the proofs in which stopping times are used.

One of the basic properties of martingales is that, if formula_36 is a (sub-/super-) martingale and formula_37 is a stopping time, then the corresponding stopped process formula_38 defined by formula_39 is also a (sub-/super-) martingale.

The concept of a stopped martingale leads to a series of important theorems, including, for example, the optional stopping theorem which states that, under certain conditions, the expected value of a martingale at a stopping time is equal to its initial value.

<doc id="274537" wikidata="Q3302990" url="?curid=274537" title="Maynard Jackson">
<text>Maynard Holbrook Jackson Jr. (March 23, 1938 – June 23, 2003) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 54th mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, from 1974 to 1982, and again as the city&#x27;s 56th mayor from 1990 to 1994. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first Black mayor of Atlanta and of any major city in the South; his three terms made him the second longest-serving mayor in the city&#x27;s history, after six-term mayor William B. Hartsfield.

He is notable also for public works projects, primarily the new Maynard H. Jackson International terminal at the Atlanta airport, and for greatly increasing minority business participation in the city. After his death, the William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport was renamed Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport to honor his service to the expansion of the airport, the city and its people.

==Family history, background and personal life==
Jackson was born into a family that valued education and political activism. His maternal grandfather was civil rights leader John Wesley Dobbs, who worked to successfully overturn the white primary in Georgia. He also gained the hiring of black police officers in Atlanta and lighting of Auburn Street, the main retail street of the black community. Maynard&#x27;s mother Irene (Dobbs) Jackson was one of six daughters; all graduated from Spelman College, encouraged by their parents. Irene earned a doctorate in France and became a professor of French at the college.

His father Maynard Holbrook Jackson was a Baptist minister from New Orleans. He became active in civil rights in Dallas, Texas, where he had grown up after his family moved. His grandfather Alexander Stephens Jackson had been a Baptist minister and educator in Louisiana and Texas. The young Jackson&#x27;s father died when he was fifteen; his grandfather Dobbs became even more influential in his life.

Jackson attended David T. Howard High School in Atlanta and Morehouse College, a historically black college for men in Atlanta, graduating in 1956 at the age of eighteen. He sang in the Morehouse College Glee Club. After attending the Boston University Law School for a short time, Jackson held several jobs, including selling encyclopedias. He returned to graduate studies, attending the North Carolina Central University Law School. He graduated with a law degree in 1964. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

Jackson married Burnella &quot;Bunnie&quot; Hayes, in 1965. The couple had three children, Elizabeth, Brooke, Maynard III. Prior to their divorce, Bunnie Jackson founded &quot;First Class, Inc&quot;. She was the first African-American woman to own a public relations and marketing firm in Atlanta.

Jackson married Valerie Richardson in 1977, to whom he was married for 25 years until his death. They have two daughters, Valerie and Alexandra. Valerie Jackson hosts &quot;Between the Lines&quot; each weekend on the WABE-FM radio station, the Atlanta Public Broadcasting station.

==Early career==
Jackson worked as a lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board and a legal services firm. He joined the Democratic Party.

==Political career==
In 1968, when Jackson was 30 years old, he decided to run for the US Senate against incumbent Herman Talmadge. His campaign was underfunded, and he lost, but Jackson won in Atlanta, gaining prominence in the city, which had a substantial black minority. The following year, he built on his strength, gaining election as vice mayor, who was presiding officer of the board of aldermen. At that time, Atlanta modified its city charter, strengthening the position of mayor and renaming the vice mayor as president of the city council (aldermen were now city council members).

In 1970, Jackson became Atlanta&#x27;s first black Vice-Mayor, his first elected position which he held for four years. Later that year, Jackson supported sanitation workers in the city who had gone on strike, with his support contributing to their receiving a higher wage.

In 1973, Jackson was elected with 60 percent of the vote, as the first African-American mayor of Atlanta and any major southern city; he was supported by a coalition of white liberals/moderates and African Americans. At the age of 35, he unseated incumbent Sam Massell.

During his first term, Jackson worked to improve race relations in and around Atlanta after the polarization caused by the election campaign. As mayor, he led the beginnings and much of the progress on several huge public-works projects for the city and region. Affirmative action programs helped minority and women-owned businesses to participate. He helped arrange for the upgrade of the then-William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport&#x27;s huge terminal (now Domestic Terminal) to modern standards. Jackson strongly opposed the construction of freeways through in-town neighborhoods, knowing that such actions destroyed thriving communities. In 1977, Jackson fired over 900 sanitation workers during the 1977 Atlanta sanitation strike. Following this act of strikebreaking, many of the workers returned to work by the end of the year.

Jackson was mayor through the period when the separate Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) obtained a large amount of federal funding for a rapid-transit rail-line system, when construction began, and when MARTA began its first rail transit service in Atlanta and in DeKalb County in 1979 and during its continual expansion thereafter. As mayor, he celebrated in September 1990 when Atlanta was selected as the host city for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. As mayor, he accepted the Olympic flag at the 1992 closing ceremonies in Barcelona, Spain. He oversaw the completion of many planned public works projects, such as improvements to freeways and parks, and the completion of Freedom Parkway, which were expedited from 1990 to 1996 in preparation for the Olympic Games that began in August 1996.

During Jackson&#x27;s second term as mayor, the Atlanta Child Murders were ongoing between 1979 and 1981. He supported the Atlanta Police and other police forces in the area but also worked to calm public tensions aroused by the serial killings of black children. The accused killer, Wayne Williams, was caught in 1981. Williams was convicted to serve two consecutive life sentences for the murder of two adult males, but never charged with or tried for the murder of any of the child victims. He is currently being held in Telfair State Prison.

In 1974, Jackson received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

==Controversy==
Maynard Jackson heightened racial tensions in May 1974 when he attempted to fire the incumbent white police chief, John Inman. Jackson believed the change was needed to grapple with Atlanta&#x27;s growing crime problem and charges by the black community of police racial insensitivity toward African Americans.

In August 1974 Mayor Jackson appointed A. Reginald Eaves, an activist and personal friend, as Public Safety Commissioner. Eaves was criticized for lacking police experience. He generated controversy by appointing an ex-convict as his personal secretary and for what was considered as affirmative action in the police department, which some described as &quot;reverse discrimination.&quot;

Jackson fired Eaves after revelation of a police exam cheating scandal. Eaves was later convicted by a federal jury of extortion in 1988 after selling his vote on two rezonings.

In 1991 Jackson awarded transgender supermodel Caroline Cossey (known under the stage name &quot;Tula&quot;) honorary citizenship to Atlanta, though he later rescinded it after he learned that she was transgender, saying “I wouldn’t have given it to somebody whose claim to fame was being transsexual” despite Cossey having a career for many years before her gender reassignment was public knowledge. Cossey stated that she felt insulted by his decision.

==Atlanta&#x27;s crime==
In addition to the 1979–1981 Atlanta Child Murders mentioned above, residents were concerned about a rising crime rate during Mayor Jackson&#x27;s tenure, which was consistent with national trends. In 1979, with a soaring murder rate and nationwide publicity about crime there, Georgia Governor George Busbee, acting on a request from Mayor Maynard Jackson, called in Georgia State Patrol troopers to help patrol the downtown. The business community accused Mayor Jackson and Police Chief George Napper of dismissing public concerns about crime. Atlanta had the highest murder rate and the highest overall crime rate of any city, and the numbers were rapidly climbing higher, with a 69% increase in homicides between 1978 and 1979 alone. Much of it was considered to be driven by drug wars.

==Service to the Democratic National Committee==
After leaving office as mayor, Jackson continued to be active with the Democratic Party. In 2001 he unsuccessfully sought the post as the Democratic National Committee chairman, losing to the fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe, who had the backing of former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Jackson was backed by presidential candidate Bill Bradley, among others.

Jackson was appointed as the National Development Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and was the first Chairman of the DNC Voting Rights Institute. In 2002, he founded the American Voters League, a non-profit and non-partisan effort to increase national voter participation. He appeared briefly in the 2001 documentary &quot;Startup.com&quot;.

==Legacy and honors==
Towards the end of his second mayoralty, a 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Jackson as the twenty-fourth-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

<text>Christopher Ashton Kutcher (; born February 7, 1978) is an American actor, producer and entrepreneur. Kutcher began his acting career portraying Michael Kelso in the Fox sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (1998–2006). He made his film debut in the romantic comedy &quot;Coming Soon&quot; (1999), followed by the comedy film &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; (2000), which was a box office success. In 2003, Kutcher starred in the romantic comedies &quot;Just Married&quot; and &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. That year, he created and produced the television series &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, also serving as host for the first eight of its ten seasons. Kutcher starred in the science fiction film &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; (2004) and had a voice role in &quot;Open Season&quot; (2006).

Kutcher appeared in more romantic comedies, including &quot;Guess Who&quot; (2005), &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot; (2005), &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot; (2008), and &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2011).

== Early life ==
Kutcher was born on February 7, 1978, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Diane (&quot;née&quot; Finnegan), a Procter &amp; Gamble employee, and Larry M. Kutcher, a factory worker. He has Czech, German, and Irish ancestry.

Kutcher was raised in a &quot;relatively conservative&quot; Catholic family. He has an older sister named Tausha and a fraternal twin brother named Michael, who had a heart transplant when the brothers were young children. Michael also has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars. Michael&#x27;s cardiomyopathy caused Kutcher&#x27;s home life to become increasingly stressful. He has said he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to come home and find more bad news&quot; about his brother, stating, &quot;I kept myself so busy that I didn&#x27;t allow myself to feel.&quot; Kutcher stated that, when he was 13, he contemplated committing suicide to save his brother&#x27;s life with a heart transplant; when he told his father he was considering jumping from a Cedar Rapids hospital balcony, his father dissuaded him from doing so shortly before doctors announced that a transplant had become available from an accident victim in another state.

Kutcher attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to Homestead, Iowa, where he attended Clear Creek–Amana High School. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to three years of probation and 180 hours of community service. Kutcher stated that although the experience &quot;straightened him out&quot;, he lost his girlfriend and anticipated college scholarships, and was ostracized at school and in his community.

Kutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996, where his planned major was biochemical engineering, motivated by the desire to cure his brother&#x27;s heart ailment. At college, Kutcher was kicked out of his apartment for being too &quot;noisy&quot; and &quot;wild&quot;. Kutcher stated, &quot;I thought I knew everything but I didn&#x27;t have a clue. I was partying, and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I am amazed I am not dead.&quot; To earn tuition money, Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids and sometimes sold his blood plasma. While at the University of Iowa, he was approached by a model scout at The Airliner bar in Iowa City, Iowa, and entered the &quot;Fresh Faces of Iowa&quot; modeling competition. Placing first, he won a trip to New York City&#x27;s International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. Leaving Iowa for a stay in New York City, Kutcher then returned to Cedar Rapids, before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.

== Career ==
=== Modeling ===
After participating in an IMTA competition in 1998, Kutcher signed with Next modeling agency in New York, appeared in commercials for Calvin Klein, and modelled in Paris and Milan.

=== Acting ===
Following his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition. He was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, from 1998 to 2006. Kutcher was cast in a series of film roles; although he auditioned but was not cast for the role of Danny Walker in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001) (replaced by Josh Hartnett), he starred in several comedy films, including &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; (2000), &quot;Just Married&quot; (2003), and &quot;Guess Who&quot; (2005). He appeared in the 2003 family film &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; as a self-obsessed actor. In the 2004 drama film &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, Kutcher played a conflicted young man who time travels. While the film received negative reviews, it was a box office success.

In 2003, Kutcher produced and starred as the host in his own series, MTV&#x27;s &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, that involved hidden camera tricks performed on celebrities. He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Hollyhood&quot; (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), &quot;The Real Wedding Crashers&quot;, and the game show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. Many of his production credits, including &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg. A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a &quot;hunky young actor [who] is heading in all different directions at once&quot;, including &quot;the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce&quot;:

Because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kutcher was unable to renew his contract for the eighth and final season of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, although he appeared in its first four episodes (credited as a special guest star) and returned for the series finale. Kutcher produced and starred in the 2010 action comedy, &quot;Killers&quot;, in which he played a hitman. In May 2011, Kutcher was announced as Charlie Sheen&#x27;s replacement on the series &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;.

His debut as the character Walden Schmidt, entitled &quot;Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt&quot;, was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011. The Nielsen ratings company reported that figure was more than any episode in the show&#x27;s first eight seasons, when Sheen starred in it. Kutcher earned an episode on the show. The show ended with a forty-minute series finale &quot;Of Course He&#x27;s Dead&quot; on February 19, 2015.

Kutcher appeared in a Popchips ad campaign in May 2012. The campaign featured Kutcher as an Indian man named Raj who was &quot;looking for love&quot; in a dating ad-style spoof. Kutcher&#x27;s use of brown face paint and a stereotypical Indian accent received criticism from online viewers and members of the Indian-American community.

Kutcher appeared as a guest Shark during the seventh season of reality TV show &quot;Shark Tank&quot;, which premiered on September 25, 2015.

In 2016, he appeared in the &quot;Candy, Quahog Marshmallow&quot; episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;. From 2016 to 2020, Kutcher co-starred in the Netflix series &quot;The Ranch&quot; alongside Danny Masterson, Elisha Cuthbert and Debra Winger, playing the role of Colt Bennett, the son of a Colorado rancher (Sam Elliott) returning home from a semi-pro football career to run the family business on the ranch. On April 30, 2022, it was announced that Kutcher would have a guest appearance in the follow-up sitcom, &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot;.

Gargiulo was found guilty and sentenced to death on July 16, 2021, for her murder.

In late 2002, he began dating Brittany Murphy, his co-star in &quot;Just Married&quot;.

Kutcher and Demi Moore met in 2003 and married on September 24, 2005. Six years later, on November 17, 2011, Moore announced her intention to end the marriage. After more than a year of separation, Kutcher filed for divorce from Moore on December 21, 2012, in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on November 26, 2013.

Kutcher began dating his former &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; co-star Mila Kunis during the first half of 2012. After they became engaged in February 2014, she gave birth to a daughter in October 2014. Kunis married Kutcher in July 2015. She gave birth to a son in November 2016. The family resides in a sustainable farmhouse, designed by the couple and architect Howard Backen, in Beverly Hills.

=== Interests and beliefs ===
In 2009, Kutcher described himself as a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. He is a gun owner but supports new gun laws to help stop mass shootings. Following the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, he said on Twitter &quot;I&#x27;ve had a gun since I was 12 yrs old but enough is enough. I&#x27;m a hunter and a sportsman but nobody needs assault rifles. Let&#x27;s pray. Then let&#x27;s change the law.&quot;

He trains in the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and is a brown belt under Rigan Machado.

On September 17, 2008, Kutcher was named the assistant coach for the freshman football team at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. However, he was unable to return in 2009 because he was filming &quot;Spread&quot;.

In February 2011, Kutcher sold his Hollywood Hills home, which he originally bought in 2004 for .

Kutcher grew up as a Catholic. As an adult, he practices Kabbalah, and has visited Israel and studied the Torah; his wife Mila Kunis stated that he &quot;taught [me] everything I never knew&quot; about her religion, Judaism, though as of 2018, he has not converted. On trips to Israel, Kutcher visited Kabbalah centers in Tel Aviv and in Tsfat. In 2013, Kutcher remarked, &quot;Israel is near and dear to my heart ... coming to Israel is sort of coming back to the source of creation—trying to get closer to that. And as a creative person, going to the source of creation is really inspiring. And this place has been really inspiring for me—not only on a spiritual level, but also on an artistic and creative level.&quot;

=== Social media presence ===
On April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach more than 1 million followers, beating CNN in the site&#x27;s &quot;Million followers contest&quot;. In November 2011, Kutcher received heavy criticism for his tweet in response to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, calling the firing of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno &quot;in poor taste&quot;. Kutcher subsequently turned over management of his Twitter account to his team at the Katalyst Media company.

In April 2011, Kutcher and then-wife Demi Moore began a public service announcement campaign to end child sex trafficking. Kutcher claimed that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery. The number was criticized by newspaper &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Kutcher and others including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, C-SPAN, and CNN used a peer-reviewed study referring to minors at risk for sexual exploitation. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, from their research, said it was only hundreds of children. Kutcher claimed the criticism by the &quot;Village Voice&quot; promoted child prostitution and used Twitter to request that &quot;Village Voice&quot; advertisers withdraw their advertising from publications owned by its parent company.

=== Health ===
In August 2022, Kutcher revealed that two years earlier he had been diagnosed with vasculitis, which had impaired his hearing, vision, and mobility during the course of a year.

===Danny Masterson trial===
After the conviction of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; and &quot;The Ranch&quot; castmate, Danny Masterson, for rape, Kutcher, along with Mila Kunis, wrote letters to the judge in support of Masterson. The letters stated that Masterson was a good person and that he treated people with &quot;decency, equality, and generosity.&quot; After the letters were made public, Kutcher and Kunis received immediate backlash and criticism for their support of Masterson, especially due to Kutcher and Kunis&#x27; involvement in Thorn, a charity to expose the sexual exploitation of children. After the backlash, Kutcher and Kunis apologized in a video, in which the two claimed that the letters were only intended for the judge and not for the public. The apology was similarly criticized as &quot;performative and insincere.&quot; In response to the further backlash, Kutcher stepped down as chairman of the board of Thorn.

<text>Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (; July 6, 1888February 24, 1973) was a historian and social philosopher, whose work spanned the disciplines of history, theology, sociology, linguistics and beyond. Born in Berlin, Germany into a non-observant Jewish family, the son of a prosperous banker, he converted to Christianity in his late teens, and thereafter the interpretation and reinterpretation of Christianity was a consistent theme in his writings. He met and married Margrit Hüssy in 1914. In 1925, the couple legally combined their names. They had a son, Hans, in 1921.

Rosenstock-Huessy served as an officer in the German army during World War I. His experience caused him to reexamine the foundations of liberal Western culture. He then pursued an academic career in Germany as a specialist in medieval law, which was disrupted by the rise of Nazism. In 1933, after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, he emigrated to the United States where he began a new academic career, initially at Harvard University and then at Dartmouth College, where he taught from 1935 to 1957.

Although never part of the mainstream of intellectual discussion during his lifetime, his work drew the attention of W. H. Auden, Harold Berman, Martin Marty, Lewis Mumford, Page Smith, and others. Rosenstock-Huessy may be best known as the close friend of and correspondent with Franz Rosenzweig. Their exchange of letters is considered by scholars of religion and theology to be indispensable in the study of the modern encounter of Jews with Christianity. In his work, Rosenstock-Huessy discussed speech and language as the dominant shaper of human character and abilities in every social context. He is viewed as belonging to a group of thinkers who revived post-Nietzschean religious thought.

==Early life==
Rosenstock-Huessy was born Eugen Friedrich Moritz Rosenstock in Berlin, Germany on July 6, 1888, to Theodor and Paula Rosenstock. His father, a scholarly man, was a banker and a member of the Berlin Stock Exchange. He was the only son among seven surviving children.
Despite his parents&#x27; Jewish heritage, his family &quot;celebrated some Christian holidays, in keeping with other German families at the time.&quot; He joined the Lutheran Protestant Church at age 17 and was christened at age 18. He remained a proponent of Christianity&#x27;s foundational significance throughout the rest of his life.

After graduating from a secondary school (gymnasium) with very high academic standards and an emphasis on classical languages and literature, Rosenstock-Huessy pursued law studies at the universities of Zurich, Heidelberg, and Berlin. He corresponded with Franz Rosenzweig and Hans Ehrenberg, regarding the relationship of man with God, as understood through Judaism and Christianity. In 1909 the University of Heidelberg granted him a doctorate in law. In 1912 he became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, a preliminary qualification to becoming a professor, at the University of Leipzig, where he taught constitutional law and the history of law until 1914.

In 1914 Rosenstock-Huessy visited Florence, Italy to conduct historical research. There he met Margrit Hüssy, a Swiss art history major. They married later that year. World War I broke out shortly thereafter.

==World War I==
At the onset of World War I, the German Army drafted Rosenstock-Huessy and stationed him at the Western Front, including 18 months at Verdun, until the war&#x27;s end. &quot;During this period he organized courses for the troops, replacing the limited instruction in patriotism with broader topics. In 1916, he and his friend, the Jewish philosopher Franz Rosenzweig, also on active duty, exchanged letters on Judaism and Christianity.&quot; That correspondence has become well known as a dialog between proponents of the two related religions. Rosenstock-Huessy&#x27;s work, &quot;Judaism Despite Christianity&quot;, contains much of this correspondence.

==Interwar period==
After World War I, Rosenstock-Huessy became active in labor issues, focusing on improving education as a means to improve the societal standard of living. He returned to academia and started publishing his first noted works.

===Labor education===
Rosenstock-Huessy did not return to his teaching post at the University of Leipzig. Instead, he obtained a position with Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, the German car manufacturer, in Stuttgart, Germany. In 1919, he founded and became the editor until 1921 of the first factory newspaper in Germany, the Daimler &quot;Werkzeitung&quot; (Work Newspaper).

In 1921, Rosenstock founded &quot;Die Akademie der Arbeit&quot; (the Academy of Labor) in Frankfurt am Main. &quot;This institution offered courses and seminars for blue-collar workers, but he resigned in 1923 over differences with the trade union representatives. Nevertheless, he did not give up his involvement with adult education and his efforts to give industrial workers a voice of their own in society.&quot; He co-founded the Patmos Verlag publishing house, which published works on &quot;new religious, philosophical, and social perspectives.&quot;

===Return to academia===
In 1923, Rosenstock-Huessy received a second doctorate in philosophy from the University of Heidelberg. He then lectured at the Technical University of Darmstadt in the faculty of social science and social history until he was offered a job at the University of Breslau as a full professor of German legal history, a position he held from 1923 until January 30, 1933.

During this period, Rosenstock-Huessy became active in many other ways at the University of Breslau. He helped organize voluntary work service camps—&quot;Löwenberger Arbeitslager&quot; (Löwenberg Work Camp)—for students, young farmers, and young workers to address the living and labor conditions at coal mines in Waldenburg, Lower Silesia.

In 1926, Joseph Wittig, a reform-minded Roman Catholic priest, was excommunicated and thus lost his right to teach church history at the University of Breslau. Rosenstock-Huessy stood by his friend, Wittig, in this affair. In 1927 and 1928, they co-authored &quot;Das Alter der Kirche&quot; (&quot;The Age of the Church&quot;), which contained two volumes of essays on the history of the Church and a third volume devoted to documents leading up to Wittig&#x27;s excommunication.

In 1925, he and Hans Ehrenberg co-founded a journal, &quot;Die Kreatur&quot; (&quot;The Creature&quot;), which was edited by Wittig, Martin Buber, and Viktor von Weizsäcker, men of widely different perspectives, and which lasted until 1930. According to his recent publishers, &quot;Among the contributors [of &quot;Die Kreatur&quot;] were Nicholas Berdyaev, Lev Shestov, Franz Rosenzweig, Ernst Simon, Hugo Bergmann, Edgar Dacque, Hans Ehrenberg, Rudolf Ehrenberg, Marie Luise Enckendorff, Hermann Herrigel, Rudolf Hallo, Edith Klatt, Fritz Klatt, Ernst Michel, Wilhelm Michel, Werner Picht, Florens Christian Rang, Heinrich Sachs, and Margarette Susman. Each of these [people] had, between 1910 and 1932, in one way or another, offered an alternative to the idealism, positivism, and historicism that dominated German universities.&quot;

Soon after January 30, 1933, when the National Socialists (Nazis) assumed power in Germany, Rosenstock-Huessy resigned from the University of Breslau and departed Germany that year. By the end of 1933, he received an appointment as lecturer in German Art and Culture at Harvard University with the help of a professor of government there.

===Publications, 1914–1933===
Rosenstock-Huessy published his medieval study &quot;Königshaus und Stämme in Deutschland zwischen 911 und 1250&quot; (&quot;The Royal House and the Tribes in Germany between 911 and 1250&quot;) in 1914, which he had written in Leipzig and was the source of recognition for his second doctorate. In 1920, Rosenstock-Huessy published &quot;Die Hochzeit des Krieges und der Revolution&quot; (&quot;The Marriage of War and Revolution&quot;), &quot;a collection of current events essays that were replete with visionary thinking and practical warnings of conflicts to come.&quot; In 1921, Rosenstock-Huessy published &quot;Angewandte Seelenkunde&quot; (&quot;Practical Knowledge of the Soul&quot;) wherein he developed a new method for the social sciences based on language, the spoken word, and his &quot;grammatical approach.&quot; He later called this approach &quot;metanomics.&quot; Together with Josef Wittig, a Roman Catholic, he published &quot;Das Alter der Kirche&quot; (&quot;The Age of the Church&quot;) in 1927-28. That work contained two volumes of essays on the life of the Church and a third volume devoted to documents leading up to Wittig&#x27;s excommunication.&quot;

&quot;While he was still teaching at Breslau, Rosenstock wrote and published the first of his major works: &quot;Die Europäischen Revolutionen: Volkscharaktere und Staatenbildung&quot; (&quot;The European Revolutions and the Character of Nations; 1931&quot;). This book showed how 1,000 years of European history had been created from five different European national revolutions that collectively came to an end in World War I.&quot;

==Dartmouth College==
Rosenstock-Huessy encountered strong opposition at Harvard University to the presentation of his ideas in social history and other topics, all of which were based on his Christian faith. Reportedly, Rosenstock-Huessy frequently mentioned God in class. He also often attacked non-religious academic thinking, a teaching tradition assumed by the Harvard faculty to be a prerequisite for high scholarship. Profound differences of opinion ensued and led, in 1935, to his accepting an appointment as professor of social philosophy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He made his home in nearby Norwich, Vermont. He taught at Dartmouth until his retirement in 1957.

At Harvard, he had made friends there who helped him in his publishing efforts. His first major writing task was to develop an English-language revision of his earlier book on revolutions, and he soon published &quot;Out of Revolution: Autobiography of Western Man&quot; in 1938. George Allen Morgan, a former Harvard student under Alfred North Whitehead and himself the author of the classic &quot;What Nietzsche Means&quot;, subsequently assisted Rosenstock-Huessy in the preparation of &quot;The Christian Future or the Modern Mind Outrun&quot; in 1946. Further, Whitehead had strongly supported Rosenstock-Huessy in his disagreements with members of the Harvard faculty.

===Renewed labor education===
In 1940 he presented a request to US President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and was granted approval to organize a youth training program for the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Eleanor Roosevelt and journalist Dorothy Thompson were champions of the proposal. He then founded Camp William James in Tunbridge, Vermont as a prototype for a national peacetime volunteer labor service. &quot;Involving mainly students from Dartmouth, Radcliffe, and Harvard, its purpose was to train young leaders to expand the 7-year-old CCC from a program for unemployed youth into a work service program that would accept volunteers from all walks of life.&quot; The entrance of the United States into World War II in 1941 ended this and all other CCC programs because men were needed in the armed services and women became a greater part of the workforce. This concept anticipated the Peace Corps by more than two decades.

===Publications, 1933–1973===


Rosenstock-Huessy published &quot;Out of Revolution: Autobiography of Western Man&quot; in 1938, an English-language revision of his earlier book on revolutions. Together with George Allen Morgan, he published &quot;The Christian Future or the Modern Mind Outrun&quot; in 1946. In &quot;Out of Revolution&quot;, Rosenstock-Huessy wrote:
The present time is bound (...) to attempt an organization of future society by which the dynamite of revolution may be manipulated as persistently and consciously as contractors use real dynamite in building tunnels or roads.
During 1956 through 1958, Rosenstock-Huessy developed the principle of metanomics in his two-volume &quot;Soziologie&quot; (&quot;Sociology&quot;)—Volume I: &quot;On the Forces of Common Life&quot; (&quot;When Space Governs&quot;) and Volume II: &quot;On the Forces of History&quot; (&quot;When the Times Are Obeyed&quot;). During 1963 through 1964, he further developed this principle in Volumes I &amp; II of, &quot;Die Sprache des Menschengeschlechts: Eine Leibhaftige Grammatik in Vier Teilen&quot; (&quot;The Speech of Mankind: A Personal Grammar in Four Parts&quot;). Whereas &quot;Soziologie&quot; is unavailable in English, Rosenstock-Huessy&#x27;s &quot;Speech and Reality&quot; is an English-language introduction to that work. A collection of his writings, &quot;I Am an Impure Thinker&quot; offers a good overview of Rosenstock-Huessy&#x27;s thought processes.

==Transitions==
Rosenstock-Huessy&#x27;s wife, Margrit, died in 1959. In 1960, Freya von Moltke became Rosenstock-Huessy&#x27;s companion. She was the widow of Helmuth James von Moltke, who had opposed National Socialism and was executed by the Nazis.

After World War II and continuing through his retirement from Dartmouth, Rosenstock-Huessy was a frequent guest professor at many universities in Germany and the United States. He remained active in lecturing and writing until his final years. His output comprises more than 500 essays, articles, and monographs, as well as 40 books. He was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in 1958 at the University of Münster. Rosenstock-Huessy died on February 24, 1973. He and his wife are buried at the Hillside Cemetery in Norwich, Vermont.

==Quotations==
* &quot;The French Revolution first introduced into Europe the notion of the tissue-paper frontier. Hitherto, all boundaries had been marshes, forests, mountains, dikes; that is to say, significant boundaries. But when boundaries can be drawn on paper, they need have no more significance than the stroke of a pen or a piece of chalk.&quot;
* &quot;Grammar and logic free language from being at the mercy of the tone of voice. Grammar protects us against misunderstanding the sound of an uttered name; logic protects us against what we say having a double meaning.&quot; 
* &quot;He who believes in nothing still needs a girl to believe in him.&quot;

<text>That &#x27;70s Show is an American television teen sitcom that aired on Fox from August 23, 1998, to May 18, 2006. The series focuses on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in the fictional town of Point Place, Wisconsin from 1976 to 1979. The ensemble cast features Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon, Wilmer Valderrama, Lisa Robin Kelly, Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong, and Tanya Roberts.

In 1999, the show was remade for the ITV network in the United Kingdom as &quot;Days Like These&quot; using almost verbatim scripts with minor changes to cultural references. A spin-off series, &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot;, set in 1995 and focusing on the children of the main characters of the original show, was released on Netflix from 2023 to 2024. 

Reruns of the show air on Laff.

==Cast==
===Young cast===
*Topher Grace as Eric Forman (seasons 1–7; uncredited guest season 8): The leader and straight man of the group, Eric is a nice person, physically slight and somewhat clumsy. He has a fast wit and a deadpan sense of humor. His obsession with movies, particularly &quot;Star Wars&quot;, is often referred to throughout the show. For seven seasons Eric is in a relationship with his longtime love and neighbor Donna Pinciotti. His father, Red, is frequently hard on him and casually insults him. He convinces his parents to let his best friend Steven Hyde move in with them, making Hyde like a brother. He decides to become a teacher after high school and he leaves the series at the end of the seventh season to teach in Africa. Although Eric is mentioned at least once in every episode, he does not appear during the final season until the end of the series finale.
*Mila Kunis as Jackie Burkhart: The youngest member of the group, Jackie starts the series as the pretty, spoiled rich, selfish, oftentimes annoying immature girl. She likes to give thoughtless and superficial advice, which occasionally turns out to be correct. As the series progresses she becomes more genuine, after her father, a crooked politician, goes to jail and her fortunes take a reversal. Partly as a result of these changes, she and Donna become better friends. By the end of the series, Jackie had dated three of the four guys of the group: Kelso, Hyde and Fez.
*Ashton Kutcher as Michael Kelso (seasons 1–7; special guest season 8): Kelso is the dumb pretty boy of the group, who hopes to coast through life on his good looks. He spends the first half of the series in a relationship with the equally vapid Jackie. Their relationship comes to an end when Laurie (Eric&#x27;s older sister) reveals their affair to Jackie. Kelso fathers a daughter, named Betsy, from his relationship with a librarian named Brooke during the seventh season. He becomes a police officer, but is fired for utter incompetence. In the fourth episode of the eighth and final season, he becomes a security guard at a Chicago Playboy Club and leaves the show. Kelso, along with Eric, returns for the series finale.
*Danny Masterson as Steven Hyde: Eric&#x27;s best friend and the anti-establishment member of the group. By the end of season one, the Formans allow Hyde to move in after he was abandoned by his mother, making him a foster brother to Eric. Hyde has a witty, blunt and sarcastic sense of humor and a rebellious personality. He is also experienced and the other group members often ask for his advice. Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, in the final season he marries an exotic dancer named Samantha. Hyde later discovers Samantha was married to another man when she married him. As Donna points out in &quot;My Fairy King&quot;, that means Hyde and Samantha are not legally married. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by Tim Reid), a wealthy black businessman (making Hyde, who was presumed white, biracial). Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first an office worker, then a manager and later the owner of the Point Place record store. He also previously worked for Leo in a Photo Hut earlier in the series.
*Laura Prepon as Donna Pinciotti: Eric&#x27;s longtime girlfriend (and briefly fiancée) who is literally and figuratively &quot;the girl next door&quot;. Donna is tall, intelligent, good-looking and athletic. Donna is embarrassed by her parents&#x27; escapades—especially sexual ones. Although she does not agree with what Jackie represents in the beginning of the series, they become friends. Donna is in a relationship with Eric for seven seasons (despite their break-up during season 4). She has brief romances with Randy and Kelso&#x27;s brother Casey. She rekindles her relationship with Eric at the end of the show&#x27;s finale.
*Wilmer Valderrama as Fez: The horny foreign exchange student of the group whose hormones are usually out of control. He constantly flirts with Jackie and Donna and often makes romantic advances toward them. Initially, he has trouble getting attention from girls, but during the eighth season he becomes much more charismatic and promiscuous. He is in love with Jackie throughout the series but his love is not reciprocated until the eighth season when they become a couple. His home country is often referenced throughout the course of the show, but is never named specifically. 
*Josh Meyers as (season 8): Hyde&#x27;s employee at the record store. He is introduced in the final season. Randy appears laid back, gentle, polite and a ladies&#x27; man, although many of his flaws surface later, encompassing parts of the departed Kelso and Eric&#x27;s personalities and other attributes. Tall (like Kelso), he tends to spout witty one-liners (like Eric), and makes silly voices. He forms a friendship with Red after showing Red how good he is at fixing things. While Hyde, Jackie, Donna and Kelso embrace him as a new member of their group, Fez initially does not, but soon warms up to him. Randy dates Donna for the majority of season eight, but she later breaks up with him. The two end on good terms and remain friends. He makes a brief appearance in the series finale.

===Older cast===
*Debra Jo Rupp as Kitty Forman: Red&#x27;s wife, mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde&#x27;s informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric&#x27;s rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.
*Kurtwood Smith as Red Forman: Kitty&#x27;s husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde&#x27;s adoptive father. Red is a conservative Navy combat veteran who served during both World War II and the Korean War. He is frequently hard on Eric and casually insults him, often calling him &quot;dumbass&quot;, and finding ways to cheat Eric and his friends (especially Kelso) out of any cash they have. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing.
*Lisa Robin Kelly (seasons 2–3; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and Christina Moore (recurring season 6) as : Eric&#x27;s manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric&#x27;s friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie, which eventually leads to Jackie physically assaulting Laurie. Eric, Hyde, and Donna often insult her for her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth and sixth seasons. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series part way through season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, &quot;bottomless dancing is legal&quot;.
*Tanya Roberts as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1–3; special guest appearance seasons 6–7): Bob&#x27;s wife, Donna&#x27;s mother, and Kitty&#x27;s best friend, Midge is a woman about whom Eric and his male friends fantasize when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after divorcing Bob and moving to California, but returns in a limited guest appearance during the sixth and seventh seasons.
*Don Stark as Bob Pinciotti: Midge&#x27;s husband and Donna&#x27;s father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a veteran of two foreign wars. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red&#x27;s abuse in a jolly manner. After Midge divorces Bob in the fourth season, he begins dating Joanne (in seasons four and five) and Pam Burkhart (played by Brooke Shields replacing Eve Plumb from the first season), Jackie&#x27;s mother (in seasons six and seven).
*Tommy Chong as Leo (seasons 4 &amp; 8; special guest seasons 2–3 &amp; 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears during season four, but is later referenced in season five&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show&#x27;s end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.

==Episodes==


===Timeline===

The show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Dead&quot;, was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year&#x27;s Eve party as the characters reach &quot;one&quot; during a countdown to January 1, 1980. After the credits roll, the license plate from Eric&#x27;s Vista Cruiser is shown with the year &quot;80&quot;, indicating that the 1980s have begun.

===Eighth season and series finale===
Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career. Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season. However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star). Both Grace and Kutcher returned for the series finale, although the former was uncredited. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso&#x27;s role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an &quot;innocent character&quot;, who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series &quot;The Loop&quot;. Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers (brother of &quot;Late Night&quot; host Seth Meyers), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie. Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde&#x27;s wife for nine episodes. The location of the show&#x27;s introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle.

The eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006, and &quot;That &#x27;70s Finale&quot; was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.

==Production==
===Title===
The working titles for the show were:
*&quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot; (named after the lyric from &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; by The Who)
*&quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; (named after &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; by The Who)
*&quot;Feelin&#x27; All Right&quot; (a Traffic &amp; Joe Cocker song)
*&quot;Reeling in the Years&quot; (named after the song by Steely Dan)

Requests to use the titles of songs by The Who were rejected, and though &quot;Feelin&#x27; All Right&quot; was used as the title of the show during its upfront presentation, Fox later decided it would not be memorable enough. Bonnie Turner proposed simply calling it &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, predicting that audiences would merely refer to it by its setting anyway.

===Themes===
====The 1970s====
The show addressed many social issues of the 1970s such as sexual attitudes of the era, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking/drug use. The series also highlighted developments in fashion trends, the entertainment industry, including the television remote (&quot;the clicker&quot;), reruns, VCRs, and cable TV; the video games &quot;Pong&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;; the cassette tape and Disco; &quot;MAD&quot; magazine; and Eric&#x27;s obsession with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which came out in 1977. The show has been compared to &quot;Happy Days&quot;, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.

Beginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled &quot;That &#x27;70s Finale&quot;).

====The Circle====
In The Circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric&#x27;s basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as they speak. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the &quot;drug-induced&quot; feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word &quot;marijuana&quot; while in The Circle (except in one episode &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;), often referring to it as &quot;stuff&quot; or a &quot;stash&quot;. In the episode &quot;Bye-Bye Basement&quot;, Theo (Leo&#x27;s cousin) refers to &quot;weed&quot;; in &quot;The Relapse&quot;, Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for &quot;smoking weed and beating up freshmen;&quot; in &quot;Ski Trip&quot; Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie&#x27;s ski lodge; in &quot;Eric&#x27;s Burger Job&quot;, Kelso blames his &quot;roach clip&quot; when the water bed on which he is sitting at a party deflates; in two episodes (&quot;That Wrestling Show&quot; and &quot;Hyde Moves In&quot;), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; written on a Campbell&#x27;s soup can; and in &quot;The Pill&quot;, Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, &quot;That kid&#x27;s on dope!&quot; A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.

As the series progressed, The Circle became one of the series&#x27; recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in The Circle are &quot;Class Picture&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m A Boy&quot;, &quot;Substitute&quot;, and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, The Circle (sans the smoke) replaced the Formans&#x27; Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.

====Vista Cruiser====
Many of the show&#x27;s episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric&#x27;s &quot;Aztec Gold&quot; 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red in the pilot episode (after Red begrudgingly buys a 1976 Toyota Corolla, a more economical car). For the first seven seasons of the show, the show&#x27;s introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser. The particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show&#x27;s conclusion from Carsey-Werner for &quot;no more than&quot; . The Vista Cruiser makes a brief appearance, in its original &quot;That 70&#x27;s Show&quot; configuration, in the sequel series, &quot;That 90&#x27;s Show&quot;.

In August 2009, the show&#x27;s Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.

====Running gags and catchphrases====

In one of the show&#x27;s major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of the catchphrase, &quot;my foot in your ass&quot; or more generally &quot;kicking your ass.&quot; For example, in &quot;Kitty and Eric&#x27;s Night Out&quot;, Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, &quot;I swear I&#x27;ll kick his ass!&quot; In &quot;Eric&#x27;s Hot Cousin&quot;, Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he is sleepwalking and Red says, &quot;And I&#x27;m about to be sleep-kicking your ass&quot;, and, in &quot;Prank Day&quot;, when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone &quot;horribly, horribly wrong&quot; Red says, &quot;Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; plow through your ass. Let&#x27;s hope it doesn&#x27;t go horribly, horribly wrong!&quot; In the eighth season, Hyde asks Red, &quot;did you ever actually do that?&quot; To which Red replies &quot;Once, during the war... I can&#x27;t talk about it.&quot; Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.

Some other notable running gags and catchphrases are:
* Fez&#x27;s country of origin is never revealed. Sometimes, Fez is about to disclose where he is from, or at least hint at it, but something happens to prevent him from doing so, like someone entering the room as seen in &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, or Fez rambling in &quot;Love of My Life&quot;.
* Fez&#x27;s real name was also never revealed. Even Fez stood for FES, Foreign Exchange Student. Red often calls Fez by some exotic foreign names when he is speaking directly to him, including Tarzan.
* Someone, usually Kelso, falls off the Water Tower. Charlie is the only one to fall off and die from the tower in &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; due to him having weak endurance.
* Kelso yells &quot;Ow, my eye!&quot; when Hyde rough-houses with him. For example, in the episode &quot;Class Picture&quot;, a series of flashbacks feature Hyde beating up Kelso. While the two are out of the immediate sight of the audience, Kelso yells, &quot;Ow, my eye!&quot; and the scene cuts to the next flashback. This gag is repeated several times throughout the series, although the only time Kelso appears with an injured eye is in &quot;Jackie&#x27;s Cheese Squeeze&quot; after he was punched by Todd, Jackie&#x27;s manager. On that occasion, Kelso did not yell, &quot;Ow, my eye!&quot;
* Fez&#x27;s sex life or usually lack thereof. Often Fez accidentally reveals some perverse behavior he performed, like hiding in Donna&#x27;s room.
* The best thing to do or the best solution can be found by &quot;The Circle&quot;, sometimes from the Circle, Hyde will start to talk about a car that runs on water or conspiracies towards the Government.
* Eric&#x27;s attempted &quot;secret&quot; money stash locations are known by everyone, such as the Candy Land box.

==Reception==

===American ratings===

&quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; eight seasons, consisting of 200 episodes, made it Fox&#x27;s second-longest-running live-action sitcom ever behind &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, though it did not have the same ratings success, despite surviving cancellation.

===Awards===
Over the course of its run, the series was nominated for a substantial number of awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. The only win for the series at this event came in 1999, when Melina Root was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series for &quot;That Disco Episode&quot;. Additionally, the show was nominated for a large number of Teen Choice Awards, with both Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama winning on three occasions.

<doc id="274560" wikidata="Q2493953" url="?curid=274560" title="List of Love Hina characters">
<text>This is a list of fictional characters in the anime and manga series &quot;Love Hina&quot; created by Ken Akamatsu. The character names are listed in Western order, with the given name before the family name.

&quot;Note&quot; because the story spans over several years, any characters age mentioned below describes their age at the point of their introduction.

==Main characters==
The main characters are residents of the Hinata Inn, a former hot springs resort that is converted to an all-girls dormitory managed by Keitaro Urashima, the sole male resident.

===Keitaro Urashima===
 is a 19-year-old second-year &quot;ronin&quot; studying to enter Tokyo University (abbreviated as &quot;Todai&quot;). As a child, Keitaro made a promise to a girl, based on a story the children overheard, that two people who love each other will live &quot;happily ever after&quot; if they enter &#x27;Todai&#x27;. Keitaro is set on gaining entrance to Todai to fulfill the promise he made to his childhood friend, even though he cannot recall her name or her face. Later, in volume 13, it is revealed that Todai may not even refer to Tokyo University after all.

After failing to pass the entrance exams on his second attempt, Keitaro&#x27;s parents seem unwilling and/or unable to let him continue living at home while he studies. He then receives a call from his grandmother. As a result, he travels to &quot;Hinata Inn&quot;, a hotel owned by his grandmother, to find a place to stay and study. Following a misunderstanding where the residents believe him to be a burglar and a peeping tom, Keitaro discovers the hotel is now a female-only dormitory.

To compound the confusion, Keitaro&#x27;s Aunt Haruka mistakenly assumes he has passed the entrance exams and is already a Todai student; consequently, the residents agree to let him stay. When he fails to correct her, and they discover that he is lying, Keitaro is forced to leave until Haruka announces that his grandmother has transferred the ownership of the inn to him. Keitaro, thus, becomes the new landlord.

 Keitaro&#x27;s name is supposedly taken from manga artist Keitarō Arima. It is also believed to be a pun on the Japanese myth of fisherman Urashima Tarō.

===Naru Narusegawa===
 is a 17-year-old resident of the Hinata Inn, who is about to graduate from high school. She is very intelligent, having placed top in the nation in the college practice entrance exams at their cram school. She is popular and beautiful, but constantly tries to hide this as she studies to gain entrance to Todai. However, she has an extremely fiery temper and tends to inflict violent physical punishment (mostly on Keitaro). She arrived at the Hinata Inn as a result (she believes) of her friendship with Kitsune, who introduced her to Granny Hina. At that stage, she does not remember staying at the Hinata Inn as a very young child.

Of all the girls at the Hinata Inn, she is most often the unwilling and unwitting victim of Keitaro&#x27;s clumsiness, which often results in her ending up naked, partially clothed, or placed in any number of compromising positions. Keitaro invariably suffers as a result.

Despite initially taking a (literally) violent dislike of Keitaro, she comes to develop very strong feelings for him. The main part of her character arc is that she has great difficulty in admitting these feelings, both to herself, to the hopeless Keitaro, and the world in general. Due to this, she often becomes annoyed or irritated with Keitaro when she believes he is not taking things seriously. Naru had repeatedly denied having feelings for Keitaro even when asked. Naru while speaking to Mutsumi said, &quot;What could you possibly see in a guy like that? You probably don&#x27;t know this Mutsumi-san, but he&#x27;s clumsy, stupid, and a total pervert that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever!&quot;. She also says to Kanako she would spy on him or sabotage any dates he did get but finds the idea of dating him herself disgusting. This comment and similar situations are played for laughs. When they do date, she hits Keitaro occasionally. Like Keitaro, she strives to get into Tokyo University for two reasons: the first is a promise she made to her one-time tutor (and object of an enormous crush) Noriyasu Seta, and the second is the dimly recalled promise made to someone whose name and face she cannot remember.

===Mutsumi Otohime===
 is a very sweet, gentle, kind, and soft-spoken 20-year-old girl. Naru and Keitaro first encounter her while taking some time off for a brief vacation after the three of them failed on their Todai entrance exam. Keitaro and Mutsumi failed for a third successive time, and Naru failed for the first time.

Despite her ditziness, she is very intelligent and empathetic. Mutsumi also has anemia which caused all sorts of situations, but she is actually extremely resilient, having a strong vice-like grip even when she first appeared and just like Keitaro is seemingly able to recover quickly. Naru notices in both the manga and anime the similarities between Keitaro and Mutsumi many times. One such notable time was when they believed they first met Mutsumi (they are actually all friends from childhood) on Naru and Keitaro&#x27;s trip to Kyoto. She has a very sweet and generous personality. Being very empathetic to others, Mutsumi often puts others happiness before herself. She can also be comically clumsy at times, another trait like Keitaro. She lives on a small island off the west coast of Okinawa&#x27;s main island city Naha with her parents and seven younger siblings before moving closer to the Hinata herself. Over the course of the manga she gradually gets over her anemia to the point that in the latter parts it has left her.

Both beautiful and kind-hearted, Mutsumi shows superlative optimism when faced with even the most difficult of situations. She has a number of unusual abilities, such as being able to speak &quot;turtlese&quot;, which she uses to communicate with her turtles, namely Tama; the extreme habit of putting others&#x27; happiness before her own; a very strong propensity for watermelons; and sleepwalking on a few rare occasions (which led her into trouble once as she sleepwalked out of her window and was hit by a car). Despite her many eccentricities, she is &quot;extremely&quot; intelligent, scoring full marks in the practice exams. Yet, she still fails to get into Tokyo University because, among other things, she forgets to write her name on the test paper, causing her to obtain a grade of Z, or fainting from her anemia.

In both manga and the anime, Mutsumi is very intuitive and has a keen eye for details, noticing things her friends do not, such as, but not limited to, being the only one to know that Pararakelse island was on the opposite side of the international dateline which meant Keitaro would still be able to send his letter in time to Tokyo U and thus finally be able to attend. In the anime, she is the only one who could instinctively tell Keitaro and Kaolla Su&#x27;s brother (cousin) apart and knew which was which at all times, excluding Keitaro and Lamba themselves.

It is revealed in volume 10 that as a young child, Mutsumi spent some time living at the Hinata inn. She had learned of the stories of how if a couple was to attend Tokyo U together, they will find happiness and in turn told Keitaro of the story because she (Mutsumi) wanted to go to Tokyo U with Keitaro. She then played matchmaker for Naru and Keitaro after it became clear that Naru liked Keitaro. Mutsumi let him go for Naru&#x27;s sake by deliberately losing a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide which of them would become Keitaro&#x27;s wife (deliberately losing a game of rock-paper-scissors is something she would do a second time in the manga during the mock wedding started to help her regain her memory after falling from a tree while she was trying to help Naru down from the tree), although she (Mutsumi) loved Keitaro (and admits that she &quot;still&quot; loves him to Naru).

But even after that Naru had forgotten all about her promise to Keitaro, Mutsumi then made a subsequent promise with Naru that both of them would later go to Tokyo University so Naru would remember the promise made to Keitaro. Before leaving Hinata, she gave Naru her Liddo-kun doll in memory of their friendship. She eventually moves to an apartment very close to the Hinata Inn and starts working at the Hinata Teashop for Haruka Urashima, even staying in a spare room at Haruka&#x27;s Teashop after her apartment burnt down on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Like Keitaro and Naru, she finally passes the Todai entrance exam, discovering her result just before setting off to rescue Keitaro from the island of Pararakelse.

She studies at Todai, and later is the only one of the group to enter a graduate school. At the end of the manga, she helps out in organizing Keitaro and Naru&#x27;s wedding, and she brings a plethora of watermelons.

Mutsumi is skilled at cooking and like Keitaro is exceptional at baking cakes and other confectioneries.

Tamago or Tama for short was originally Mutsumi&#x27;s pet turtle, That she gives to Naru after she and Keitaro help her get back to her home in Okinawa.
But Tama&#x27;s friendship with her is as strong as ever.

Mutsumi is also the only one of the girls to never intentionally cause physical harm to Keitaro.

She enjoys collecting photo stickers, a hobby she and Keitaro share.

Mutsumi is stated as being very well-endowed, even though her clothes downplay her hourglass figure. Her bust is the biggest of all the girls, which is used for comical effect and fan service many times throughout the anime/manga series.

Tokyopop sometimes misspells her name as &quot;Mitsumi&quot; or &quot;Matsumi&quot;.

In the anime television series, Mutsumi is voiced by Satsuki Yukino in Japanese and Julie Ann Taylor in English.

===Shinobu Maehara===

 is a 13-year-old schoolgirl who, after getting off to a bad start with Keitaro, develops a crush on him. Shinobu is a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 201. In the anime, she is introduced as a grieving girl who has run away from home due to domestic turmoil. However, in the manga, she is already at the Hinata Inn when Keitaro arrives, and her parents are still together. Shinobu is quite skilled in cooking and household chores, so she becomes the resident cook (in the anime, her family once owned a restaurant in town before their divorce). Quiet and shy, she contributes to her emotional frailty.

She is the first girl to fall for Keitaro, and in the manga, she attempts to avoid him because of this. In both the anime and manga, she holds Keitaro in high regard and is often on the verge of tears when Shinobu believes that he is in trouble or likes someone else.

Shinobu decides to leave home and live at the Hinata Inn because of the marital problems between her father and her mother, whose names are never mentioned (in the anime). Their marital problems lead to their divorce. Shinobu&#x27;s parents arrive at the Hinata Inn and argue over whom Shinobu should live with. However, Shinobu decides to remain at the Hinata Inn, which her mother is against as she believes the Hinata Inn is a bad place full of rowdy young girls. They eventually concede, allowing Shinobu to remain living at the Inn.

Four years later (in the epilogue), she has since grown her hair out and has become more mature, though she retains her sincere personality. She still has a crush on Keitaro and hasn&#x27;t given up on her dream of becoming his girlfriend (even though Keitaro is set to marry Naru).

===Motoko Aoyama===

 is an intense 15-year-old school girl, who practices the martial art of &quot;kendo&quot;, as well as being a member of the Shinmei-ryū sword school (which is also referred to in Akamatsu&#x27;s later work Mahou Sensei Negima, as the school of the character Setsuna). Motoko is a resident at the Hinata Inn, living in room 302.

She has difficulty relating to other people, especially men, whom she finds to be a distraction that keeps her from being able to concentrate fully on her studies and practice. She also dislikes men because her sister left the dojo to marry. Her relationship with Keitaro initially resembles Naru&#x27;s relationship with him in some ways; all too often he finds himself on the receiving end of various attacks as a result of his frequent mishaps or simply bad luck. She eventually warms up to him somewhat and eventually finds herself developing strong feelings for him, which she vehemently denies until near the end of the series. On two occasions, this causes severe problems for both Motoko and Keitaro. In later volumes, she develops a habit of writing trashy romance stories involving the two of them, often involuntarily.

Motoko has an older sister, Tsuruko, who gave up the life of the sword to marry. Tsuruko is far stronger at kendo than Motoko; Motoko both greatly admires and fears her older sister. However, Tsuruko believes that Motoko has more potential than she herself does, and that Motoko lost her drive to improve when Tsuruko married. Motoko is also the next in line to inherit the Aoyama family&#x27;s Kyoto dojo, as she is not married. It is notable that Tsuruko is actually Motoko&#x27;s biological sister, as they are two of the few characters in the series who are siblings by blood relation (the second siblings couple is presented by Kaolla and Amalla Su).

Motoko has only two serious fears in the world: Tsuruko and, for some unspecified reason, turtles (even though Tsuruko correlates it to her intense dislike for men).

In the anime, Motoko is popular at her school for her kendo skills. She frequently spends time with , and , who are all fans of her. Kikuko is especially protective of Motoko and has criticised Motoko&#x27;s change in personality and decline in kendo skills since Keitaro began living at Hinata Inn, referring to him as a distraction.
===Kaolla Su===
 is a 13-year-old foreign transfer student. She is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 301.

Su is the princess of Molmol, a fictional island nation located near the International Date Line. The dot on her forehead seems to have something to do with the 3-eyed symbol of Molmol. She is often barefoot and dressed in nothing else except her heavily altered school uniform in almost every anime episode and manga chapter, or some otherwise scant costume. To top her personality, she is above all extremely hyperactive, usually hugging (or, in Keitaro&#x27;s case, kicking) someone, trying to eat something, especially bananas and Tama-chan, or inventing some potentially dangerous new device. She also has a tendency to snuggle against a person while she is sleeping, and usually crushes them while doing it.

Molmol is a kingdom where the moon sometimes appears red. It also uses a western naming order, although the Hinata Inn residents never seem to pick this up until later: Su is actually Kaolla Su&#x27;s family name.

Su likes all the other residents in the Hinata Apartments and gets along well with them, though they have difficulty keeping up with her hyperactive tendencies; only the athletic Motoko seems to be able to tolerate and keep up with her. Her like for Keitaro stems from the fact that he reminds her of the person she refers to as her older brother (actually her cousin, whom she grew up with). However, it can be inferred that she eventually comes to care about Keitaro as much as and perhaps even more than her older brother.

While she has stated that she likes everyone in the Hinata apartments (including Sarah, who was sent there for a short period of time), it is apparent that Kaolla shares a much deeper relationship with Sarah and Motoko as compared to the other residents. Her ambition is to return to her homeland to start a computing school and transform her country into a technological power that will rival, and eventually conquer, Japan.

Su also possesses the ability to transform into a more adult version of herself on a single night every year, when the moon glows red. In the anime, she admitted having fallen in love with Keitaro while she was in this form, despite her transformation just last a few seconds because there was no red moon. Though this is not explicitly stated in the manga, it is implied extremely heavily, with the adult Su even kissing Keitaro and proclaiming herself his girlfriend afterwards.

Her room in the Hinata Inn is a faithful recreation of Molmol&#x27;s natural habitat, complete with banana trees, a waterfall, and a small lake, along with a high-tech laboratory. 

===Mitsune &quot;Kitsune&quot; Konno===

, also known as Kitsune, which means &quot;fox&quot; in Japanese, is a 19-year-old freelance writer (who never seems to write anything). She is frequently drunk and seems to enjoy teasing Keitaro at every opportunity. Kitsune is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 205. She rarely pays any rent or contributes and has had a number of low paying jobs. Despite this she has never been evicted from the lodge. Her best friend is Naru. Although Naru is the more intellectual of the two, Kitsune is often the one to see things sensibly (although often she will encourage madness out of boredom), though she usually tries to reason when things are really out of control.
Her nickname comes from a combination of her first and last names, and the fact that she hardly ever fully opens both eyes at the same time (mostly when she is surprised). As a result, she has a perpetually fox-like, vulpine expression. She&#x27;s a practical joker and troublemaker; her mission in life seems to be to ensure that things never get too dull or those around her too complacent. She is also seen drinking a lot. She speaks with a Kansai dialect. In the manga (Volume 4) Kitsune&#x27;s bedroom walls are densely lined with bottles of alcoholic drinks. She is also the one who taught Kaolla Japanese.

Kitsune is more flirtatious, especially with Keitaro, than any of the other residents. Mostly this is to tease him; however, she does develop a strong crush on him; eventually she shows little serious romantic interest in him. She is also the bustiest in the household, her bust being second only to Mutsumi Otohime in size, and is unafraid of using her charms to get what she wants, whatever it might be. Her relationship with Keitaro eventually develops into a &quot;little brother/big sister&quot; connection (though Keitaro is actually older than she is).

She also is a bit greedy, as seen in a flashback sequence when she tells Keitaro about how much Naru&#x27;s innocence ended up dismissing possible boyfriends; Kitsune was shown to encourage her to date a rich boy just because of his wealth. Also, when the girls are traveling to Molmol to try to bring Keitaro back to Hinata Inn, the only thing she thinks of is the inheritance that will be left to him and the girl that he chooses whenever Hina returns, even though, later on, Kitsune lets him stay with Naru. She eventually takes over the Hinata Tea House when Haruka leaves and picks up Haruka&#x27;s habit of smoking. Between the start and the finish Kitsune held two other jobs. Her name is derived from the name of manga artist Mitsune Ayasaka. 

==Relatives==

===Haruka Urashima===

 is Keitaro Urashima&#x27;s &quot;aunt&quot; (actually his cousin). In the anime, she dislikes being called aunt by Keitaro and often smashes him in the face when she is referred to as and corrects him by saying &quot;its Haruka-san&quot; (san being a respectful term to your elder in most cases)

Haruka Urashima is the only child of Hinata Urashima&#x27;s eldest daughter, Yoko Urashima; her second daughter was Keitaro&#x27;s mother. After the death of Yoko, Hinata adopted her granddaughter. Therefore, Haruka is Keitaro&#x27;s legal aunt in addition to being his actual cousin. It was as a teenager that, while working at the inn, she was first called &quot;Aunty Haruka&quot; by her baby cousin Keitaro – the same time that Keitaro first met both Mutsumi and Naru.

Haruka is the &quot;ryōbo&quot; (&quot;house-mother&quot;) of the &quot;Joshi Senyō Ryō Hinata-sō&quot; (&quot;Women&#x27;s Only Dormitory, Hinata House&quot;) and runs the &quot;Wafū Chabō Hinata&quot; (&quot;Traditional Japanese Tea-Room Hinata&quot;). Haruka is constantly seen smoking a cigarette. Like Naru, she has a fiery temper (and great physical prowess to match), which she hides under a calm, detached exterior.

Having traveled the world with Seta and Sara&#x27;s mom, and it is hinted that a love triangle existed between the three at one point (or at least that Haruka and Seta were romantically involved); this is explored more fully in the manga, to the point that Haruka and Seta get married. Haruka&#x27;s skills in martial arts rival Seta&#x27;s and can even surpass his when she is angry. She is also very skilled with firearms, which shows when she shoots Kaolla&#x27;s missiles at Seta&#x27;s head after being teased by him. 

===Hinata Urashima===
, also known as Grandma Hina, is the original manager of Hinata. Upon retiring, she entrusted Keitaro with looking over the Hinata Inn, so she could travel the world.

In the manga, Grandma Hina knew all along that Naru was the girl Keitaro promised to go to Tokyo U with. She also knew the location of the Liddo-Kun shaped time capsule Keitaro, Naru, and Mutsumi buried beneath the sandbox when they were children. 

===Noriyasu Seta===
 is a Tokyo University graduate and professor who specialises in archaeology, appearing to be a parody of Indiana Jones. Like Keitaro, he was a third-year &quot;ronin&quot;. He&#x27;s clumsy — especially with women, and his relationship to Haruka seems to be similar to Keitaro&#x27;s relationship with Naru (i.e., both get physically thrashed around by their respective female and are married to them eventually as well as both of them apparently being invulnerable to just about everything), a terrible driver (his arrival often heralded by his van crashing down from the sky), and an exceptionally skilled martial artist, all partly due to his complete lack of self-preservation. Seta spends a good deal of his time traveling the world on one expedition or another. His goal seems to be to find evidence of the ancient turtle civilization that once flourished throughout East Asia.

Seta is also something of an adventurer, and possesses a van that shares his indestructible nature, and apparently has a submarine mode. In the past, Haruka had a major crush on him, though he seemed oblivious. They went on many expeditions together. Along with them on the expeditions was Sara&#x27;s mother, an American that looked remarkably like Naru, who later died. Her last request was that Seta marry Haruka. This wish was granted, and Haruka and Seta married at the ruins of Todai, capital of the Turtle civilization. Seta is Sara&#x27;s guardian, and she refers to him as &quot;papa.&quot;

Seta is most probably a practitioner of &quot;Jeet Kune Do&quot;. In most situations, his fighting stance is almost an exact mirror of Bruce Lee&#x27;s proprietary stance. Also, in the anime, Sara even uses the term &quot;Jeet Kune Do&quot; in reference to her father&#x27;s fighting technique. 

His name is derived from the name of manga artist Noriyasu Seta.

===Sarah McDougal===
, is a 9-year-old American from California and Seta&#x27;s adopted daughter. She initially delights in making Keitaro&#x27;s life miserable, however, like most of the girls in the story, she eventually warms up to him, even if she still calls him a dork.

Sarah is left for a time in the care of the Hinata Inn residents by Seta, as he feels that travelling the world with him on expeditions would be too disruptive to her childhood. There, she develops a close friendship with Su, most likely because of their shared disdain for the general order of things. In both the manga and anime version, Sarah even comments on how &quot;Kaolla and I are not Japanese!&quot; during a meal, when Motoko forces them all – sans Naru, who is in a field trip to Kyoto – to have a samurai-like diet. Sara quickly becomes Su&#x27;s new playmate, taking the place of Motoko, who was the only person in the house to keep up with Su&#x27;s energy. Sara and Su eventually become so close they change their hairstyles to match, both of them with two pigtails. Sara eventually does return to travelling with Seta after his marriage to Haruka.

Sarah has an uncle in California; in the anime, it was implied that she had stayed with, and been the victim of abuse, at the hands of her biological relatives. Her mother, now deceased, formerly worked with Seta and Haruka on an archaeological dig and competed for Seta&#x27;s romantic attention.

Sara possesses no unusual talents or skills, save for a certain gift for &quot;Jeet Kune Do&quot; learned from Seta, though she is adept at bashing Keitaro on the head with priceless artifacts often pulled out of nowhere. She has a panda-shaped birthmark on her buttocks, which she avoids showing at all costs. She shares her family name with Cynthia McDougal from Ken Akamatsu&#x27;s previous manga series &quot;A.I. Love You&quot;. 

===Kanako Urashima===
 is Keitaro&#x27;s adopted younger sister. Kanako is a master of disguise and is able to impersonate anyone, which she uses to try to get control over the Hinata Inn (Keitaro is the only one who can see through her disguise at simple view), and she also has a strong fable and skills in Japanese bondage techniques. Kanako never came to see Keitaro as a brother, and had loved him since they were children. When they promised to run an inn together when they grew up, she had assumed it would be as husband and wife. However, Keitaro does not share these thoughts and only sees her as a sister.

She first appears in Volume 11 of the manga, and in the &quot;Love Hina Again&quot; OVA. Her appearance is often accompanied by the sound of a bell carried on the tail of her unusual cat Kuro.

After travelling with her grandmother for some years, she returns to Japan to fulfill her promise to her brother to run an inn together. She arrives while Keitaro was away in the United States, and after assuming control, immediately changes the Hinata Inn from a girls&#x27; dormitory back into an inn. The residents are forced to either stay and work for her, or to leave.

She soon realizes that all of the girls in Hinata Inn have some sort of affection for her brother, and tests their affection in a variety of ways. She then tries to drive them away by being as mean and cruel as she could to them. At first it seemed to be working, as one by one everyone but Naru left the new Hinata Inn. When the girls (except for Naru) start to suspect Kanako&#x27;s feelings for Keitaro and why she forces them to be mean to him, they form the &quot;Hinata House Liberation Front&quot; in order to reclaim the Inn. Kanako, Naru and Mutsumi form the &quot;Hinata-rōshi&quot; (日向浪士, translated as &quot;Hinata Rebel Alliance&quot;) to reclaim it under the name &quot;Urashima Kanako-no-suke&quot; (浦島可奈子之助). 

Even without knowing her, Kanako had harbored a deep hatred for the little girl to which Keitaro promised to go to Tokyo University with, as she believes that the promise is what plagued his life with bad luck. As such, she believed that by eliminating this girl, the &quot;curse&quot; would be lifted. At first, she thought that Kitsune, who was leading the &quot;Liberation Front&quot;, was this girl, but in the nick of time, Naru ended up revealing that she was most likely the girl. Disheartened for having trusted her unwilling sworn enemy, Kanako attempted to sabotage Naru&#x27;s relationship with Keitaro upon his return. However, in the end, she recognized that it was Naru whom he liked, and reluctantly accepts their relationship. 

==Minor characters==

===Amalla Su===
 is Kaolla Su&#x27;s older sister. She has long white hair, blue eyes, and wears an outfit resembling that of an Indian/Arabian princess. Both she and her sister are magical girls, and both are members of the royal family of the kingdom of Molmol. Amalla has been in love with cousin Crown Prince Lamba Lu for a long time, but has never admitted her feelings to him. She speaks Japanese in an Edokko accent, and claims to be from the deserts of Edo (Edo is an old name for Tokyo, which of course has no deserts). In combat, she possesses two weapons: a magical flute that controls the weather, and her pet albino alligator Shiro. She is referenced in the manga and has several appearances in the anime. 

===Lamba Lu===
The &quot;Brother&quot; to Amalla and Kaolla. In reality, he is a cousin of theirs, but they have grown up as siblings. He is the king of their nation, and in the tradition of their people, he has to serve in the military for a period of time. Before that happens, he is required to marry. Once when Kaolla was a very young girl he promised to marry her, but then he realises that she only sees him as a brother, whereas Amalla is in love with him. He marries Amalla instead.

Lamba Lu looks almost exactly like Keitaro when they both have their glasses on; the only striking differences are that he&#x27;s a bit more tanned than Keitaro is, has darker hair and dark green eyes, and a somewhat Indian/South Asian appearance. Unlike Keitaro, however, Lamba Lu is very calm, collected, and &#x27;together&#x27;, and not at all clumsy or awkward.

While Lamba Lu does not appear explicitly in the manga, he does interact with Keitaro at one point and has a different role. In volume 14, Keitaro receives a letter from Lamba Lu inviting the former &quot;ronin&quot; to take part in a joint research project between Tokyo University and the University of Molmol (in which case Lamba Lu is actually the chairman of the joint research project) on the Lost Todai Ruins. 

===Kentaro Sakata===
, an anime-specific character, had a crush on Naru. Originally Keitaro&#x27;s rival for Narusegawa, he eventually loses all of his money in his pursuit of her. He remained fairly tenacious for a time, but eventually gave up after getting deep into debt with the Hinata Inn. Haruka let him try to work off his debts at a very low pay rate of $1.50 an hour; from that point on, Kentaro became an occasional background character and plot device, like giving advice to Keitaro and supporting his feelings for Narusegawa.

Moreover, Kentaro has been repeatedly mispronounced as &#x27;Keitaro&#x27; by the residents, and occasionally by himself, mainly before they grew too familiar with him. Strangely enough though, he has absolutely nothing, besides his original affection for Naru, in common with Keitaro. 

===Mei Narusegawa===
 is Naru&#x27;s younger sister. Naru describes her as her &quot;half-sister&quot; in manga volumes 11 and 14. On the other hand, in the anime, episode 22, Mei said &quot;My father married her mother.&quot; This leads some to speculate that they are stepsisters, although this is never confirmed. She initially tries to get Keitaro and Mutsumi together in the hopes that Naru would return home if Keitaro were taken. She gives up on this when she and Naru clear up a few family misconceptions. Furthermore, in &quot;Love Hina Again&quot;, she makes a very brief appearance to help all the Hinata residents about Keitaro and Naru&#x27;s relationship &amp; help speed it up. She also appears in the last volume of the manga, seen standing off on the side with the rest of the residents of Hinata Inn, while Naru is chasing Keitaro down after accidentally undressing her. She also plays a minor role in the Spring Movie.

Mei was created for and appears primarily in the &quot;Love Hina&quot; anime, though she is referred to in at least two places in the manga and is seen in the last chapter of the final volume of the manga. 

===Tsuruko Aoyama===
 is Motoko&#x27;s older sister and the one currently entrusted with the keeping of their family&#x27;s Shinmeiryuu tradition. She is not active in running the school, having given up the life of the sword for marriage, and it is her duty to hand the school over to Motoko&#x27;s care when the time comes.

Though Motoko has lived in fear of Tsuruko for years, Tsuruko has Motoko&#x27;s best interests at heart and her only real wish is for her sister to be happy on whatever path she chooses to walk. Unfortunately, she has a habit of trying to kill her sister when she lies to her (when she tried to take Motoko back to Kyoto and, to prevent this, she pretended to be engaged with Keitaro) or does not tell her the full details of a situation (when Motoko admitted that she flunked the Todai admittance exam). She also gets into a bloodthirsty mood whenever Motoko is lazy and does not do her best (this is only seen in a nightmare sequence of Motoko).

While her usual appearance is that of a very proper lady well versed in Japanese culture, she sometimes has the eyes of a demon and becomes extremely violent. She is an incredible swordswoman whom few could hope to face, even though she abandoned the dojo after getting married. She is a very serious character, but also very just and, in her own weird way, only cares for the well-being of her sister.

She has a beautiful pet crane named &quot;Shippu&quot;, which she later gives to Motoko in the thirteenth volume after Motoko finally defeats her. Like her sister, her sword techniques are centered around the destruction of evil, using ki attacks with her slash, some of them hurting only evil beings, but mostly slashing through rocks, people or larger objects (like a sports car, driven by Kentaro, that was &#x27;accidentally&#x27; about to run over Keitaro – in the manga, it was a truck whose driver was drunk and sleepy) as if they were made of paper. 

===Kimiaki Shirai===
 is one of Keitaro&#x27;s friends. He loves to make fun of Keitaro, calling him a failure in girls and academics, but pulls back later on when Keitaro becomes more successful. He almost always appears with Haitani. His main interests are in women, and one of his only upside is some degree of skill in computers. He also seems to have an interest in older woman like Haruka. He is short, and is almost always shown with big round glasses. In the manga&#x27;s fifth volume, Su even calls him a &quot;small, fat, Hobbit&quot;. 

===Masayuki Haitani===
 is one of Keitaro&#x27;s friends, and is (apart from a few physical differences) almost exactly like Shirai. He is taller, wearing tiny round glasses, and enters a university before Shirai or Keitaro. Like Shirai, Haitani&#x27;s primary interests lie in women, relying on his charm to attract female attention, but to no avail. He appears to be the leader of the trio, formulating many schemes to gain girlfriends for himself, Keitaro, and Shirai (despite Keitaro&#x27;s reluctance to go along with them), most notably the Hinata tenants, but they end in constant failure, getting them into trouble (if not all three, then only Keitaro) with the girls. 

===Ema Maeda===
 appears in the epilogue of the &quot;Love Hina&quot; manga, Volume 14, which is set three years (four in the English manga) after the end of the main storyline.

A timid 15-year-old girl who dabbles in conspiracy theories, Ema hopes to get into Tokyo University so she can improve her life and have people notice her. Due to her poor grades, she left home in order to live at the &quot;legendary&quot; Hinata Inn, which is believed to have the power to get anyone into Tokyo University. Being very clumsy, her arrival at the Hinata Inn mirrors Keitaro&#x27;s initial arrival, as she is mistaken for a peeping tom and is chased out of the hot springs. In awe of all the beautiful girls living at the Hinata Inn, she accidentally steals Naru&#x27;s wedding veil, tripping a theft alarm in the process. She is rescued by and flees with Keitaro. Despite a shaky first day, everything is set right when she is given a thank you kiss by Naru for finding and returning both her veil and groom. She then realizes that she can achieve her dreams if she tries hard enough. She has a pet chameleon named Leon.

===Nyamo Namo===
 is a young girl of the island Pararakelse. Her grandfather was once an acquaintance of Seta, and after her grandfather&#x27;s death, Nyamo decided to work with Seta on his excavations to continue her grandfather&#x27;s work. Nyamo is physically almost identical to Shinobu, except for her darker skin and longer hair. She also shares a number of other traits with Shinobu as well, including her extreme initial shyness and reluctance to speak and a crush on Keitaro (which is shown when she glomps Keitaro in her second appearance and for which Naru punches him into the ground for &quot;assaulting&quot; Nyamo). She also seems to have developed a fear of Naru after seeing her bludgeon Keitaro into the air (even hiding behind her giant tortoise when she saw Naru afterwards) though she is also very hard to surprise, often having the same innocent quizzical expression in any situation. Nyamo and Shinobu quickly become good friends and correspond when apart. In the manga, when she visits the Hinata Dorms, she brings with her a pet giant tortoise named Gidget. 

===Ken Akamatsu===
 makes brief cameo appearances in the anime television series and Love Hina Specials, serving as a minor plot device character. He is referred to as Akamatsu Sensei, and is voiced by Akamatsu himself.

==Animals/Pets==

===Tama-chan===
 (in full is the turtle given to Keitaro by Mutsumi. Keitaro points out that the turtle is male, but the girls are convinced he is a &#x27;she&#x27; and so &#x27;he&#x27; is referred to as &#x27;she&#x27; throughout the manga. She is an &#x27;onsen kame&#x27; or hot-springs turtle, and like others of her species, she can fly. Su, Mutsumi, Seta, and (later in the series) Keitaro appear to have the ability to speak with Tama-chan, and Su occasionally develops the urge to eat her, though sometimes it is just to tease Shinobu (in the manga, it is said on a side note that Su drops this habit in order to wait for Tama-chan to reproduce). She appears in &quot;Negima&quot; on Chizuru Naba&#x27;s apron on the back cover of volume 8, in chapter 85 of volume 10, and in other places as pictures. 

===Mecha-Tama-chan===
Su, convinced she is going to have to face Tama-chan down at some point (Su wants to eat her), has designed multiple mechanical versions of Tama. Every Mecha-Tama has turned out to be dangerous to the residents of the Hinata Inn.
* Mecha-Tama-Chan 0 (a prototype): Volume 11
* Mecha-Tama-chan 1: Volume 5
* Mecha-Tama-chan 2: Volume 5
* Mecha-Tama-chan Mark 3: Volume 7
* Mecha-Tama-chan 4: Volume 8
* Mecha-Tamago 5: Volume 13
* Mecha-Tama-chan 6: Volume 14
* Mecha-Tama-chan 30: Volume 14

Su has been developing Mecha Tama-chans during the three years that have passed since the end of the main story until the marriage of Keitaro and Naru. Kanako Urashima gets ahold of Su&#x27;s prototype Mecha-Tama in her reign over the house in volume 11, and is the only time someone besides Su used a Mecha-Tama, aside from Naru in volume 7 in her attempt to keep Keitaro and Mutsumi apart.

===Kuro===
 is a black cat with huge ears which follows Kanako. It first appears in book 11 of the manga, and in the &quot;Love Hina Again&quot; OVA. It becomes friends with Tama-chan. Kaolla is very interested in researching it, and Sarah calls him &quot;witch cat&quot; after knowing about Kuro&#x27;s unusual abilities to fly (using its oversized ears) and talk. In the anime, Kuro can talk, but in the manga, instead of Kuro being able to talk, it is just Kanako&#x27;s ventriloquism. It carries a bell on its tail, which sounds as characteristic when Kanako appears.
As a footnote, Ken Akamatsu explained in his notes in Volume 14, page 148 that Tama, Kuro, Shippu, and Leon were inspired by the &quot;Four Legendary Animals of Japanese Mythology&quot;. Tama was inspired by Genbu, Kuro by Byakko, Shippu by Suzaku, and Leon by Seiryuu.

<text>Nine Lessons and Carols, also known as the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols and Service of Nine Lessons and Carols, is a service of Christian worship traditionally celebrated on or near Christmas Eve in Anglican churches. The story of the fall of humanity, the promise of the Messiah, and the birth of Jesus is told in nine short Bible readings or lessons from Genesis, the prophetic books and the Gospels, interspersed with the singing of Christmas carols, hymns and choir anthems.

==History==
Although the tradition of Nine Lessons and Carols is popularly associated with King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, its origins are attributed to Truro Cathedral in Cornwall. Up to the late 19th century, the singing of Christmas carols was normally performed by singers visiting people&#x27;s houses, and carols — generally considered to be secular in content — had been excluded from Christian worship. In the Victorian era, the rising popularity of hymnody encouraged church musicians to introduce carols into worship. An 1875 book of carols, &quot;Carols for Use in Church During Christmas and Epiphany&quot; by Richard Chope and Sabine Baring-Gould, was an influential publication. At around this time, the composer and organist John Stainer was compiling a collection, &quot;Christmas Carols New and Old&quot;, and during Christmas 1878 he introduced carols into the service of Choral Evensong at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Other cathedrals also began to adopt carols at Christmastide that year and the &quot;Royal Cornwall Gazette&quot; reported that the choir of Truro Cathedral would sing a service of carols at 10:00 pm on Christmas Eve:

Two years later, the Right Rev. Edward White Benson, at that time Bishop of Truro, conducted the first formal service of &quot;Nine Lessons and Carols&quot; on Christmas Eve (24 December) 1880. Benson, concerned at the excessive consumption of alcohol in Cornish pubs during the festive season, sought a means of attracting revellers out of the pubs and into church by offering a religious celebration of Christmas. The idea for a service consisting of Christmas music interspersed with Bible readings was proposed by the succentor of the cathedral, the Rev. George Walpole (who later became Bishop of Edinburgh). The cathedral — a Victorian gothic building — was still under construction, and services were being held in a temporary wooden structure which served as a pro-cathedral. The first Nine Lessons and Carols service took place there at 10:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve and was attended by over 400 people.

Benson&#x27;s son, A. C. Benson, later recalled: 
Bishop Benson was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1883, and the Nine Lessons service began to gain in popularity across the Church of England and the wider Anglican Communion, as well as Roman Catholic churches in England and Wales. The original liturgy has since been adapted and used by other churches all over the world, particularly in English-speaking countries. Lessons and Carols most often occur in Anglican churches. However, numerous Christian denominations have adopted the service, or a variation of it, as part of their Christmas celebrations. In the UK, the service has become the standard format for school carol services.

On Christmas Eve 1914, David Wilson organised the first service of Nine Lessons and Carols in Ireland in North Strand Church in Dublin. A special carol service was held in 2014 to celebrate the centenary.

In 1916, a service of Nine Lessons and Carols was held at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island; the institution celebrated the 100th anniversary of its Lessons and Carols in 2016.

Notably in 1918, the Rev. Eric Milner-White the new dean of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, introduced the service to the college chapel, taking advantage of the established choral tradition of the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. It proved highly successful, and began an annual tradition — albeit with some alterations to Benson&#x27;s original format from 1919 onwards. The BBC began to broadcast the service on the radio from 1928 and on television from 1954, establishing &quot;Carols from King&#x27;s&quot; as the most popular and widely recognised presentation of the service.

In North America, the Lessons and Carols tradition spread to other US and Canadian institutions. In 1928, organist and choirmaster Twining Lynes, introduced the service to Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts, after being inspired by services in England.

In Canada, the Festival of Nine Lessons and carols is done multilingually at Bishop&#x27;s College School, Quebec, with the nine lessons read in nine languages or dialects.

In December 2013, Truro Cathedral staged a reconstruction of Bishop Benson&#x27;s original 1880 Nine Lessons with Carols Service which was attended by a congregation of over 1,500 people.

==Service at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge==

The first Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge, was held on Christmas Eve in 1918, directed by Arthur Henry Mann who was the organist from 1876 to 1929.
. During World War I the dean, Eric Milner-White, had served as army chaplain in the 7th Infantry Division and he was concerned that the distress of the &quot;Great War&quot; had hardened attitudes against religion. Taking advantage of the established choral tradition of the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, he introduced Benson&#x27;s carol service to King&#x27;s as a means of attracting people back to Christian worship.

The King&#x27;s College service was immensely successful, and the following year Milner-White made some changes to Benson&#x27;s original format, notably introducing the tradition of opening the service with a solo treble singing &quot;Once in Royal David&#x27;s City&quot;. This was then followed by a bidding prayer penned by Milner-White himself, and re-ordering the lessons. The choir had 16 trebles as specified in statutes laid down by Henry VI, and until 1927 the men&#x27;s voices were provided by choral scholars and lay clerks. Today, 14 undergraduates from the choir sing the men&#x27;s parts.

===Broadcasting of the service===
The popularity of the service was established when the service began to be broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1928, and, except for 1930, has been broadcast every year since. During the 1930s the service reached a worldwide audience when the BBC began broadcasting the service on its Overseas Service. Even throughout the Second World War, despite the stained glass having been removed from the chapel and the lack of heating, the broadcasts continued. For security reasons, the name &quot;King&#x27;s&quot; was not mentioned during wartime broadcasts.

Nine Lessons and Carols from King&#x27;s College was first televised by BBC Television in 1954, conducted by the director of music, Boris Ord.
Since the Second World War, it has been estimated that each year there are millions of listeners worldwide who listen to the service live on the BBC World Service. Domestically, the service is broadcast live on BBC Radio 4, and a recorded broadcast is made on Christmas Day on BBC Radio 3. In the US, a 1954 service was put into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2008. The broadcast has been heard live on public radio stations affiliated with American Public Media since 1979, and most stations broadcast a repeat on Christmas Day. Since 1963, the service has been periodically filmed for television broadcast in the UK. Presently, each year a programme entitled &quot;Carols from King&#x27;s&quot; is pre-recorded in early or mid-December then shown on Christmas Eve in the UK on BBC Two and BBC Four. The programme is weighted more heavily in favour of carols sung by the choir, with only seven readings in total, not all of which are from the Bible.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the service was conducted, for the first time, without a congregation. The service did not take place live, but instead a pre-recorded service produced by King&#x27;s College was broadcast at the usual time. It was the first time since 1930 that the service had not been broadcast live.

===Order of service===
The format of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols has not changed substantially since 1918. The order of the lessons was revised in 1919, since when the service has always begun with the hymn &quot;Once in Royal David&#x27;s City&quot;. Today the first verse is sung unaccompanied by a solo boy chorister. To avoid putting him under undue stress, the chorister is not told that he will be singing the solo until immediately before the service.

The nine lessons, which are the same every year, are read by representatives of the College and of the city of Cambridge using the text of the King James Version of the Bible published in 1611. The singing is made up of &quot;carols&quot; sung by the choir and &quot;hymns&quot; sung by the choir and congregation. Some services have also included anthems sung between the carols and hymns, such as a performance of &quot;E&#x27;en So, Lord Jesus, Quickly Come&quot; in 2004. Since 1983, a new carol has been commissioned by the College and premiered at the service. The carols vary from year to year, although some music is repeated, and the service ends with the hymn &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;. The order of service in 2024 is as follows:

===Commissioned carols and organ postludes===

The table below shows the new carols commissioned by King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, since 1983.


Organ postludes have also been commissioned in certain years, as shown in the table below.


===Attendance at the service===
Attendance at the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols held on Christmas Eve is now by ticket only, many of which are allocated by public ballot; standby tickets are also made available to those who applied in the ballot. Owing to the service&#x27;s popularity, demand for seats greatly exceeds the number of tickets available. In previous years, when tickets were available at the door, some people began queuing the night before, but now only those with standby tickets are permitted to stand in the queue.

<text>Robert Edward &quot;Bob&quot; Brookmeyer (December 19, 1929 – December 15, 2011) was an American jazz valve trombonist, pianist, arranger, and composer. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Brookmeyer first gained widespread public attention as a member of Gerry Mulligan&#x27;s quartet from 1954 to 1957. He later worked with Jimmy Giuffre, before rejoining Mulligan&#x27;s Concert Jazz Band. He received eight Grammy Award nominations during his lifetime.
==Biography==
Brookmeyer was born on December 19, 1929, Kansas City, Missouri, United States. He was the only child of Elmer Edward Brookmeyer and Mayme Seifert.

Brookmeyer began playing professionally in his teens. He attended the Kansas City Conservatory of Music, but did not graduate. He played piano in big bands led by Tex Beneke and Ray McKinley, but concentrated on valve trombone from when he moved to the Claude Thornhill orchestra in the early 1950s. He was part of small groups led by Stan Getz, Jimmy Giuffre, and Gerry Mulligan in the 1950s. During the 1950s and 1960s, Brookmeyer played in New York clubs, on television (including being part of the house band for &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;), and on studio recordings, as well as arranging for Ray Charles and others.

In the early 1960s, Brookmeyer joined flugelhorn player Clark Terry in a band that achieved some success. In February 1965, Brookmeyer and Terry appeared together on BBC2&#x27;s Jazz 625.

Brookmeyer moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1968 and became a full-time studio musician. He spent 10 years on the West Coast and developed a serious alcohol problem. After he overcame this, he returned to New York. Brookmeyer became the musical director of the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra in 1979, although he had not composed any music for a decade. Brookmeyer wrote for and performed with jazz groups in Europe from the early 1980s. He founded and ran a music school in the Netherlands, and taught at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, and other institutions.

In June 2005, Brookmeyer joined ArtistShare and announced a project to fund an upcoming third album featuring his New Art Orchestra. The resulting Grammy-nominated CD, titled &quot;Spirit Music&quot;, was released in 2006. Brookmeyer was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in the same year. His eighth Grammy Award nomination was for an arrangement from the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra&#x27;s album, &quot;Forever Lasting&quot;, shortly before his death. That same album was also nominated in the 57th Annual Grammy Awards for the category of Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album; the CD was entirely made up of Brookmeyer&#x27;s compositions.

Brookmeyer died of congestive heart failure on December 15, 2011, in New London, New Hampshire.

== Compositional style ==
One notable element of Brookmeyer&#x27;s compositional style is his use of contemporary classical writing techniques in his works for big bands and jazz ensembles. In the early 1980&#x27;s Brookmeyer was mentored by composer Earle Brown, with whom he explored 20th century classical music in depth. Brookmeyer&#x27;s works since have been influenced by such composers as Witold Lutosławski (whose cello concerto Brookmeyer used often in teaching students about simple motifs), Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, György Ligeti, and Béla Bartók.

Some examples of 20th-century classical compositional techniques used in Brookmeyer&#x27;s jazz pieces are:
* &quot;ABC Blues&quot;, where an atonal tone row is used to generate melodies and harmonies.
* &quot;The Big Time&quot;, where polytonality is used to develop melodies used earlier on in the composition.
* Bob Brookmeyer uses chromatic harmony and tone clusters throughout such works as &quot;Seesaw&quot;, &quot;Silver Lining&quot;, and &quot;Hello and Goodbye&quot;.

<text>RV &quot;Polarstern&quot; (meaning pole star) is a German research icebreaker of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven, Germany. &quot;Polarstern&quot; was built by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in Kiel and Nobiskrug in Rendsburg, was commissioned in 1982, and is mainly used for research in the Arctic and Antarctica. The ship has a length of 118 metres (387 feet) and is a double-hulled icebreaker. She is operational at temperatures as low as . &quot;Polarstern&quot; can break through ice thick at a speed of . Thicker ice of up to can be broken by ramming.

==History==
On 7 September 1991, &quot;Polarstern&quot;, assisted by the Swedish arctic icebreaker , reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels. Both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common tug of war and a football game on an ice floe. In 2001, &quot;Polarstern&quot; together with reached the pole again. She returned for a third time on 22 August 2011. This time she reported the most frequently recurring ice thickness at compared with in 2001.

On 2 March 2008, one of the vessel&#x27;s helicopters crashed on a routine flight to the Antarctic Neumayer II base. The German pilot and a Dutch researcher were killed, and three other passengers were injured.

On 17 October 2008, &quot;Polarstern&quot; was the first research ship ever to travel through both the Northeast Passage and the Northwest Passage in one cruise, thus circumnavigating the North Pole.

The German government in 2015 issued a request for bids on the construction of a replacement for &quot;Polarstern&quot;, but did not award a contract and eventually withdrew the request in early 2020 as it no longer covered current technological demands for a long-term, efficient and economic vessel.

On 20 September 2019 &quot;Polarstern&quot; sailed from Tromsø, Norway, for a 12 to 14 month-long Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition across the Arctic. She settled in an ice floe on 4 October 2019. The aim was drifting with this floe, passing the North pole and eventually reaching open water in the Fram Strait. While stuck in the ice in March 2020, a member of the aircraft team who had not yet joined the ship in the Arctic tested positive for COVID-19. This resulted in the entire aircraft team being placed in isolation in Germany and caused delays in the retrieval of scientific data from around the ship to provide context to the data taken aboard. After 389 days, this 2019 – 2020 arctic expedition successfully ended on 12 October 2020 when the research vessel safely returned to its home port of Bremerhaven, Germany.

A revised request for bids for a replacement, reflecting changes in technology since the first was issued, was expected, with &quot;Polarstern II&quot; possibly ordered in 2022 to enter service in 2026 or 2027. The new vessel could cost over €800m, and could include hybrid diesel-electric propulsion, integrated under-water robotic systems and several helicopter landing options.

==Expeditions updates==
Current listings of all cruises on board &quot;Polarstern&quot; as well as associated contents (e.g., tracklines, weekly reports, cruise reports, publications and data) are presented on the platform portal of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) for Polar and Marine Research.

==In popular culture==
The ship plays a central role in German musician Schiller&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Atemlos&quot; (German for &quot;breathless&quot;). A track is titled after the ship. It is also featured in the DVD of the same title, showing the musician&#x27;s expedition on the vessel.

<text>Christ&#x27;s Hospital is a private school (English fee-charging boarding school for pupils aged 11–18) with a royal charter, located to the south of Horsham in West Sussex. 

The school was founded in 1552 and the royal charter granted in 1553 (26 June, 7 Edw. VI). Since its establishment, Christ&#x27;s Hospital has been a charity school, with a core aim to offer children from disadvantaged backgrounds the chance of a better education.

==Charitable foundation==
Christ&#x27;s Hospital is unusual among British independent schools in that the majority of the students receive bursaries. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a means-tested basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school or their benefactors, so that pupils from all walks of life are able to have private education that would otherwise be beyond the means of their parents.

The trustees of the foundation are the Council of Almoners, chaired by the Treasurer of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, who govern the foundation according to a Scheme of Administration granted by the Charity Commission. The historic Court of Governors survives as a formal institution consisting of over 650 benefactors but its powers have since the 19th century been largely transferred to the smaller Council of Almoners.

In 2007 Christ&#x27;s Hospital was formally separated into two related registered charities: Christ&#x27;s Hospital Foundation and Christ&#x27;s Hospital School.

==History==
Christ&#x27;s Hospital was the result of the foundation by Henry VIII and confirmed by Edward VI, assisted by Nicholas Ridley, Bishop of London, and Sir Richard Dobbs, Lord Mayor of London. Its genesis was the earlier dissolution of the monasteries and the resultant overflow onto the streets of the poor and destitute. Encouraged by a sermon from Ridley, exhorting mercy to the poor, the king wrote to the Lord Mayor encouraging him to action. This he did via a committee of 30 merchants. 

Henry VIII had already granted the use of Greyfriars to the city for the relief of the poor and to house the homeless children which the magistrates had taken notice of. In 1553 (26 June, 7 Edw. VI) Edward granted Bridewell Palace, his lands at the Savoy, and rents and other chattels to create three Royal Hospitals – Christ&#x27;s Hospital, Bridewell Hospital (now the King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley, Surrey) and St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. The three institutions use the same coat of arms, although slightly modified by the latter.

The first boys and girls entered the school in Newgate in 1552. The Royal charter was granted and signed by its founder, Edward VI, the following year. The first treasurer was Richard Grafton. The Protestant foundation survived the Marian period and in the 1560s it sent its first scholars to Oxford and Cambridge.

The school occupied Newgate as its major site for 350 years, but from time to time children were housed in other parts of the country. 32 children perished during the Great Plague of 1665. In the following year the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the hospital, except four cloisters and three wards, but there were no casualties among the children. Around 200 pupils were sent to Islington and Clerkenwell and then to Ware and Hertford.
By the end of the 17th century the buildings had been rebuilt with the assistance of Sir Christopher Wren, a governor of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, and Nicholas Hawksmoor, who designed the Writing School (1696). The church of Christ Church, Newgate Street, designed by Wren, replaced the damaged choir of the former Greyfriars&#x27; church and served as a place of worship for the children of Christ&#x27;s Hospital in the city until the move to Horsham. Through the will of the royal jeweller, George Heriot, it also became the inspiration for the foundation of George Heriot&#x27;s Hospital in Edinburgh, which was the first of the &quot;Hospital Schools&quot; to be founded in Scotland.

Christ&#x27;s Hospital was given its second Royal charter by Charles II in 1673. This created the Royal Mathematical School, the original purpose of which was to train mathematicians and navigators who would serve as naval officers and merchant seafarers. Samuel Pepys, Secretary to His Majesty&#x27;s Navy and from 1699 vice-president of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, made a considerable contribution to Christ&#x27;s Hospital. Isaac Newton, Jonas Moore, John Flamsteed, and Edmund Halley contributed to plans for the course of study of the new school within the foundation.


The girls of the hospital settled at Hertford from 1707. The governors had been paying a teacher in Hertford from 1653, and the removal of some children from London following the Great Fire strengthened the link with the town. In 1761, 200 boys under the age of ten along with the boys from Ware were relocated to Hertford. In 1778 the last girls were moved out of London to join the others at Hertford, where the school was rebuilt 1795–1798 to provide accommodation for the new numbers.

Christ&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s most famous upper master was James Boyer who presided from 1778 to 1799 and instructed James Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

In November 1815 the &quot;most infamous Regency flagellant”, an MP named Sir Eyre Coote, entered Christ&#x27;s Hospital mathematical school, sent away the younger boys and paid the older ones for a session of mutual flogging. The school nurse arrived to find him buttoning his breeches; England&#x27;s satirical press had come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment. Coote endured a cartoon by George Cruikshank, a vaunted caricaturist, and national humiliation.

The notable London architects, John Shaw Senior and John Shaw Junior, were architects and surveyors to Christ&#x27;s Hospital throughout the first half of the 1800s. The Shaws&#x27; work included the old school hall (c.1825).

The Duke of Cambridge started a tradition of Royal Presidents in 1854.

A commission of inquiry in 1837 proposed reforms, and in 1864 the Taunton Commission investigated the endowed schools. As a result of this a greater number of girls were admitted. However, in the 1890s boys still outnumbered girls at Hertford.

Another commission in 1877 proposed a new site for the school, where all the boys would be taught. This proposal was questioned by some of the governors. The Duke of Cambridge said:

However, the proposal was carried out. of land outside Horsham in Sussex was purchased from the Aylesbury Dairy Company for £47,500. The foundation stone was laid by Edward, Prince of Wales on 23 October 1897, on behalf of the sovereign, the date being the anniversary of the birthday of the founder. The new school was designed by architect Aston Webb, with fireplaces by Leonard Shuffrey. Historic architectural features from the old school buildings (the Grecians&#x27; Arch and the Wren Arch) were salvaged and incorporated in the new buildings.

The boys were relocated from Newgate and Hertford to the new site in 1902. Hertford became a girls-only school.

Over the centuries Christ&#x27;s Hospital has continued to enjoy royal patronage. In 1919, George V became the first royal patron, followed by George VI in 1937 and Elizabeth II in 1953.

Sexual abuse of pupils from 1969 to 2001 led to six former teachers being convicted of offences after more than 20 former students made complaints to the police in 2016. The convicted former teachers were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.

==Architecture==

The ensemble of buildings in the Christ&#x27;s Hospital Horsham campus were Grade II* listed in 1959. The complex includes a tall water tower, a dining hall facing a quadrangle flanked by collannaded wings, and a school chapel.

The red brick colonnades are joined to the dining hall with stone archways which were designed by John Shaw in 1836 for the old school in Newgate Street in the City of London. These archways were dismantled and re-erected here at the Horsham site in 1902.

The Big School is noted for its large Perpendicular-style windows, its octagonal turrets and a square clock tower on the roof. Another remnant of the Newgate Street school is to be found at the south end of the Big School, the portico designed by Sir Christopher Wren.

The dining hall is dominated by an -long painting by Antonio Verrio which depicts the foundation of the Royal Mathematical School at Christ&#x27;s by King Charles II in 1673. The canvas contains over 100 figures, including Charles II, and King James II was added at a later date. The painting had previously hung in the former Great Halls in London for over 320 years.

The school chapel was designed by Aston Webb and E Bell. The Bath stone reredos at the east end depicts Christ in Glory surrounded by sculptures of the Twelve Apostles, and in the lower panel is Christ receiving the children. The Apostles were designed by William Silver Frith, with the central panel by William Bateman Fagan and Bell, and carved by stonemasons Daymond &amp; Son. Another work by Frith is s statue of the Good Shepherd in a niche above the chapel door, which was installed as a war memorial in memory of Old Blues who died in World War I.

The altar, by Norman &amp; Burt of Burgess Hill, is in mahogany inlaid with holly ornamentation. The stained-glass window is by Thomas Ralph Spence and the pipe organ was built by Alfred Kirkland.

The walls of the chapel nave are adorned with a series of sixteen murals, painted by Frank Brangwyn in tempera in 1912-23. The murals illustrate scenes from the early Christian Church, including depictions of the martyrdom of St Alban, St Columba landing at Iona, St Ambrose training his choir, and St Paul.

==Traditions==

Links with the City and the Lord Mayor of London are maintained, with an annual parade through the City of London on St Matthew&#x27;s Day and a regular place in the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show.

One of the Christ&#x27;s Hospital traditions is marching into lunch with the band, which is done every day except Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday, weather permitting.

Another is the annual speech-day parade, where the Lord Mayor of London and his procession watch the school perform a march-past through the main quad. They also join the school in chapel for a grand service, and eat lunch with the Grecian year and their parents. Lastly they move to Big School to hear the Senior Grecian&#x27;s oration and witness the Grecian prize-giving. This is held on the Saturday at the start of the Summer Half Term.

===Uniform===
The Tudor school uniform consists of belted, long blue coats, knee-breeches, yellow socks, and bands at the neck. The uniform has been in place since 1553. The nickname &quot;Blue-coat School&quot; comes from the blue coats worn by the students; however, the nickname used within the school community itself is &quot;Housey&quot; and the long coat is called a &quot;Housey coat&quot;. Variants of the Housey Coat include a version with larger buttons and velvet cuffs, known as the &#x27;Buttons&#x27; coat. These are issued to the Monitors, a group of Grecian prefects, as well as an academic commendation to Grecian pupils. Those in the latter category wear these coats with the third button on the cuff undone to signify this distinction.

Second and third form pupils wear a simple leather belt with a buckle. When pupils reach their &quot;Little Erasmus&quot; year (year 9), they were presented with more elaborate hallmarked sterling silver &#x27;broadie&#x27; buckles and belts, which the pupils keep after leaving the school. However, today the &#x27;broadie&#x27; buckles tend to be made of base metal with a silver coating. It is also not uncommon for pupils with parents or siblings who attended the school to wear additionally the buckles of their relatives, leading to some pupils to have as many as 5 buckles on their broadie belt. Special buckles are also issued to House Captains, as well as the Senior Grecian (the senior student of the school).

A complementary uniform was introduced for girls on re-unification of the schools in 1985 when the girls&#x27; part of the school closed in Hertford and moved to Horsham. This consists of a knee-length pleated skirt, summer jacket, yellow socks (for the boys and junior girls), and grey socks or grey/black tights for senior girls, as well as the long coat in winter, and the bands.

During periods of hot weather conditions, the Head Teacher may allow pupils to wear so-called &#x27;Half Housey&#x27;, where the Housey coat may be left off and shirts and breeches/skirts only be worn.

In 2011 students and alumni stated that they saw the uniform as an important way of giving the school a unique identity and unifying the school. Around that time the administrators had discussed the idea of updating the uniform. Over 95% of students voted in favour of keeping the original uniform.

==Admissions==

As a guide, children entering Christ&#x27;s Hospital at age 11 into Year 7 need to show evidence of academic potential, working towards the higher end of the ability range in both the Mathematics and English National Curriculum syllabuses.

The assessment process for a bursary place is in two stages. An initial assessment in October which is followed by a residential assessment in January.

Admission in Year 9 is also based on Christ&#x27;s Hospitals own assessment process. Candidates for entry at age 13 into Year 9 who do not require a bursary may choose to apply to be tested at age 11 and have their place deferred.

All applicants at Year 12 should be on course to achieve a minimum of four A (level 7 grades) and four B (level 6 grades) at GCSE. Following an assessment process, offers are made which are conditional on achieved performance at GCSE.

In all cases reports will be requested from a candidate&#x27;s current head teacher.

=== Historic methods of entry ===
Christ&#x27;s Hospital has a number of historic methods of entry that are attached to bursary applications.

==== Wests&#x27; Gift for Children ====
John and Frances West lived in the latter part of the 17th and early part of the 18th centuries. John became a wealthy merchant in the City of London and lived in a house on the site that is now occupied by the Mansion House.

John and Frances had no children of their own but they did have strong family connections with Newbury, Reading, Twickenham and the City of London. Children from these areas are therefore encouraged to apply for a place at Christ&#x27;s Hospital via the West Gift Bursary fund.

==== RAF Foundationers Trust and 617 Squadron ====
Sir Barnes Wallis, a former pupil, governor and treasurer set up the RAF Foundationers Trust in 1951. An award was made to him in recognition of his work by the 617 Squadron of the RAF and Wallis set up the fund with the award. The RAF Benevolent Fund donated a like amount.

The fund provides an income for the education of a small number of children in the school at any one time. Consideration for places is given to children of personnel who are serving or who have served in the RAF.

==== Royal Navy/Royal Mathematical School ====
Samuel Pepys was a governor and Vice President of the school; he instigated the opening of the Royal Mathematical School at Christ&#x27;s Hospital in 1673 which was founded to educate children in mathematics for the practice of navigation. As a result, special consideration for a maximum of forty places is given to children of personnel who are serving, or have served in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines or Royal Naval Reserve.

==== City livery companies ====
Christ&#x27;s Hospital was founded in the City of London over 460 years ago as a charity funded by city businesses and the church to provide training/education to poor street children. The school retains its connections with these organisations, some of which have an ancient right to &#x27;present&#x27; a child to the school.

The school Admissions Office is able to advise whether any presentations are available for a child&#x27;s year of entry.

==School activities==

===Music===

Christ&#x27;s Hospital has a long and distinguished musical tradition and has one of the largest school music departments in the country, with around 35 visiting staff and eight full-time staff. Famous alumni of Christ&#x27;s Hospital Music School include conductors Sir Colin Davis, Charles Hazlewood, Adrian Bawtree and Simon Joly, trumpeter David Mason (formerly Principal Trumpet of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), composer Tim Benjamin, and composer and conductor Constant Lambert.

The school&#x27;s chapel has a large five-manual Rushworth and Dreaper organ, one of four organs in the school (the others being a 3-manual 1829 Hill in Big School, played on by Mendelssohn and Karg-Elert, a 2-manual Father Willis in the Dining Hall, and a Flight and Robson chamber organ in the Court Room). The near 150-strong Chapel Choir has made many recordings and through these has earned an excellent reputation.

Throughout the school&#x27;s history, many pupils have gone on to take up choral and organ scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge universities or have gained places at leading music conservatories. The school has a symphony orchestra, a chapel choir and many other smaller instrumental ensembles and choirs, along with an annual House Singing Competition. The Music Department organises a public concert every February at St John&#x27;s, Smith Square in London. The school is also famous as the first place in England to host a complete cycle of the chamber music of Brahms, under the direction of the then Head of Piano John Thwaites.

Christ&#x27;s Hospital was featured in the first series of the reality television programme &quot;Rock School&quot;, in which Gene Simmons of Kiss helped a group of pupils form their own rock band.

The school&#x27;s most famous ensemble is its marching band, simply named Christ&#x27;s Hospital Band. It plays for the daily parade and performs in the annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show in the City of London. The band also has a regular engagement each summer at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground. The band led the procession at the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday parade in London on 21 April 2006 and has played at Twickenham Stadium on a number of occasions.

===Drama===
An Arts Centre complex designed by architect Bill Howell was opened in 1974, including a theatre with Tudor-style auditorium, an extension to the music school, the &#x27;Octagon&#x27; rehearsal/performance space, and classrooms.

The Christ&#x27;s Hospital Arts Centre served as a principal arts venue for Horsham and the surrounding area until the establishment of an arts centre in Horsham in the 1980s. A programme of performances continues to be open to the public.

Former pupils in theatre and film include Jason Flemyng, Leo Gregory, James D&#x27;Arcy, Michael Wilding and Roger Allam.

==Houses==
Christ&#x27;s Hospital has introduced a small number of day students since 2011; however, most of the students continue to be boarders. The school houses are named after notable Old Blues (the CH-specific term for alumni), primarily writers. Each house has an &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; side, home to roughly 45 pupils. The houses are arranged from west to east as follows:

===Avenue houses===

*Peele – George Peele (boys) 
*Thornton – Edward Thornton (girls)
*Middleton – Thomas Middleton (boys)
*Coleridge – Samuel Taylor Coleridge (girls)
*Lamb – Charles Lamb (boys)
*Barnes – Thomas Barnes (girls) 
*Maine – Henry James Sumner Maine (boys)
*Leigh-Hunt – Leigh Hunt (girls)

The sixteen original main boarding houses stretch from Peele to Leigh Hunt along The Avenue, built as four H-blocks on either side of the main Quad. Leigh Hunt was originally the pair of preparatory houses, Prep A and Prep B, and were converted to junior houses on the abolition in 1964 of entry at the age of nine.

The sixteen original houses provided two dormitories (Upper Dorm and Lower Dorm) sleeping up to about 30 boys each. As the merger of the boys and girls approached, some dormitories were divided into cubicles, and subsequent developments created dormitories accommodating about twelve pupils each. Since 2001 there has been a rolling refurbishment programme, with the refurbished houses providing a range of accommodation: four-bed rooms for the junior pupils to one-bed rooms for the more senior pupils.

Until 1964, boys at Horsham lived in all-through houses from 2nd Form to Grecians (with the exception of Prep A and Prep B). Then houses were divided into senior houses (Peele, Thornton, Middleton, Coleridge and Lamb) and Junior houses (Barnes, Maine, Leigh Hunt) with boys transferring to a senior house after Little Erasmus. In conjunction with the merger, a further reorganisation occurred with each house converting to a senior side and a junior side. This system reverted to the all-through houses in 2000, now from 2nd Form to Deps.

=== Grecians houses===

Year 13 (Grecian) students move to Grecians houses, which provide a transitional style of life in preparation for university or life beyond school. The two Grecians houses were completed early in 2001, and have individual study bedrooms plus several general common rooms and kitchenettes shared by a group of seven to ten pupils, thus introducing pupils to life in a mixed communal environment as they prepare themselves for university.

*Grecians West (for pupils who were previously in Peele, Thornton, Middleton, and Coleridge)
*Grecians East (for pupils who were previously in Lamb, Barnes, Maine, and Leigh Hunt)

<text>Nikolai Semyonovich Kardashev (, ; April 25, 1932 – August 3, 2019) was a Soviet and Russian astrophysicist best known for the Kardashev scale, which measures a civilization&#x27;s status in technological evolution based on the amount of energy it is capable of harnessing and using. He was also the deputy director of the Astro Space Center of the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

==Early life==
He was born in Moscow to a family of professional revolutionaries involved with the Bolshevik Party. His parents were Semyon Karlovich Brike and Nina Nikolaevna Kardasheva; his father was an important member of the party, and his mother joined as well before the October Revolution in 1917. Both of his parents were arrested during the Great Purge of 1937 and 1938. His father was ultimately shot and his mother was assigned to labor camps and would not be released for many years. Due to his parents’ absence, he was sent to an orphanage from which he was then taken by his mother&#x27;s sister after a great deal of effort. His aunt then died during World War II when he was 16 years old and he then had to live on his own in a large communal flat. His mother was released in 1956, by which time Nikolai had completed university.

== Education ==
He attended Moscow State University in the astronomy division of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. He concentrated his studies based on his interest in radio astronomy, a topic that was new and developing at the time. After graduating in 1955, he worked at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute and received his doctorate in physical and mathematical sciences in 1962.

== Career ==
He joined the Space Research Institute (IKI) of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1967. He became deputy director of IKI in 1977. During the dissolution of the USSR, Nikolai became the director of the Astro Space Center of the Lebedev Physical Institute. In 1978, Nikolai started a space satellite project known as RadioAstron. The program endured for more than 30 years and a space satellite named Spektr-R was finally launched in 2011. The mission RadioAstron has become important for modern observational astrophysics.

In 1964, at a conference in Soviet Armenia, he presented a paper titled &quot;Передача информации внеземными цивилизациями&quot; (&quot;Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations&quot;). The paper proposed what would become known as the Kardashev scale, the idea of measuring a civilization&#x27;s technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is able to use, with a civilization that can use all the energy of a planet defined as Type I (the other Types, II and III, were defined as civilizations that can use all the energy of a star and a galaxy, respectively). He also proposed Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), which replaced conventional radio transmission lines with magnetic tape recordings; it was demonstrated in 1967.

He may have predicted the existence of pulsars before they were actually discovered, in his paper ‘Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations&#x27;.

== Organizations ==
He was an active participant of the International Astronomical Union, for which he was: Vice-president of Executive Committee (1997–2003), vice-president of Commission 51 Bio-Astronomy (1982–1991), Organizing Committee Member of Commission 40 Radio Astronomy (1967–1985), Member of Division B Facilities, Technologies and Data Science (2019), Member of Division F Planetary Systems and Astrobiology (2019), Member of Commission 40 Radio Astronomy (2015), Member of Commission 51 Bio-Astronomy (2015), Member of Division III Planetary Systems Sciences (2012), Member of Division X Radio Astronomy (2012), and Member of Special Nominating Committee (2000–2003).

He was a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences&quot;, Division of General Physics and Astronomy:&quot; first as a corresponding (associate) member (12 December 1976), then as a Full Member (21 March 1994), and served as director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Council on Astronomy from 1999 until his death.

He was a participant of the Committee on Space Research as vice president from 1982 to 1986.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1980 he shared the USSR&#x27;s State Prize for the development and experiments with the orbital radio telescope KRT-10, and in 1988 he shared the USSR&#x27;s State Prize for the discovery of Radio Recombination Lines. In 2012, Nikolai received the Grote Reber Gold Medal for innovative lifetime contributions to radio astronomy.

== Movie career ==
His first association with the movie industry was in 1981. He was asked to be a consultant on the set of &quot;Petlya Oriona&quot;, a Russian television series documentary. He played himself in a TV show episode on the documentary series &quot;Space&#x27;s Deepest Secrets&quot; in 2018 as well as playing himself in a TV show episode on the documentary series &quot;Horizon&quot; in 2018.

== Death ==
Kardashev died on August 3, 2019, at the age of 87.

== Publications ==
* 1963 - &quot;Candidate of Science&quot; dissertation, later promoted to higher level of doctoral thesis.
* 1964 - “Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations” which presented a classification of civilizations based on their degree of power consumption spanning 20 orders of magnitude, which became known as the Kardashev Scale.

<text>USCGC &quot;Healy&quot; (WAGB-20) is the United States&#x27; largest and most technologically advanced icebreaker as well as the US Coast Guard&#x27;s largest vessel. She is classified as a medium icebreaker by the Coast Guard. She is homeported in Seattle, Washington, and was commissioned in 1999. On 6 September 2001 &quot;Healy&quot; visited the North Pole for the first time. The second visit occurred on 12 September 2005. On 5 September 2015, &quot;Healy&quot; became the first unaccompanied United States surface vessel to reach the North Pole, and &quot;Healy&#x27;s&quot; fourth Pole visit (and her second unaccompanied visit) happened on 30 September 2022.

==Construction==
&quot;Healy&quot; was built by Avondale Industries in New Orleans, Louisiana. The construction included a technology transfer agreement between Avondale Industries and the Finnish Kværner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology Centre, where the latter provided expertise for hull form development and propulsion line engineering based on the Finnish diesel-electric icebreaker &quot;Otso&quot;.

&quot;Healy&quot; is named in honor of United States Revenue Cutter Service Captain Michael A. Healy. Her keel was laid on 16 September 1996. &quot;Healy&quot; joined the icebreakers and in their homeport of Seattle, on 10 November 1999. The ship departed New Orleans, on 26 January 2000, performing sea trials off of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and in Baffin Bay, between Canada and Greenland. She arrived in Seattle on 9 August 2000, after transiting the famed Northwest Passage and was placed &quot;In Commission, Active&quot; on 21 August 2000.

==Design==

&quot;Healy&quot; is an optimally manned vessel, meaning she has the minimum number of personnel staffed in order to safely navigate. Due to the vast array of missions conducted by &quot;Healy&quot;, it is vital that crew members are fully qualified on a number of duties. &quot;Healy&quot; operates two A-Frames, one on the aft working deck and one on the starboard side. There are two articulated cranes on the aft working deck, with the starboard side rated to and the port side rated to . The aft working deck provides ample space to conduct science and research operations. &quot;Healy&quot; has a forecastle crane with a load capacity of , and two 04 level cranes with load capacities of 15 tons each. &quot;Healy&quot; has a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) that uses her 2200-horsepower Omnithruster Bow Thruster system, which aids in navigation and station keeping during science operations. Her flight deck is capable of landing both of the Coast Guard&#x27;s helicopter airframes, and attached is a hangar that can house 2 Eurocopter HH-65 Dolphin helicopters. &quot;Healy&quot; can accommodate 8 ISO vans on the ship, which are used as science labs and workstations. &quot;Healy&quot; has three small boats on board. One is the Arctic Survey Boat (ASB), which is on the starboard side. &quot;Healy&quot; has two Cutter Boat Large (CBL) Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB), one on each side.

==Capabilities==

Designed to conduct a wide range of research activities, &quot;Healy&quot; provides more than of scientific laboratory space, numerous electronic sensor systems, oceanographic winches, and accommodations for up to 50 scientists. &quot;Healy&quot; is also designed to break of ice continuously at or ice thick when backing and ramming, and can operate in temperatures as low as .

As a Coast Guard cutter, &quot;Healy&quot; is also a platform for supporting other potential missions in the polar regions, including: search and rescue, ship escort, environmental protection, and law enforcement.

==Notable operations==
6 September 2001: &quot;Healy&quot;, on her three-phase maiden voyage, became only the second U.S. surface ship to reach the North Pole as a part of the Arctic East Science Mission, accompanied by the German research icebreaker . &quot;Healy&quot; returned to her homeport, Seattle, on 20 December 2001 after 192 days at sea, which were punctuated by two port calls in &quot;Tromso&quot; Norway to exchange science teams. The second phase of the voyage, in Arctic ice, included testing of an autonomous underwater vehicle (UAV).

23 January 2002: &quot;Healy&quot; received the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation award for meritorious service from 12 June 2001 to 21 December 2001, during the Arctic East 2001 Science Mission. &quot;Healy&quot; mapped of the Gakkel Ridge, previously the only unmapped undersea ridge in the world. Twelve previously unknown volcanoes and numerous undersea hydrothermal vents were discovered. of rock samples were taken from over 100 deep sea dredges.

7 May 2003: &quot;Healy&quot; received the Coast Guard Unit Commendation award for exceptionally meritorious service from January 2003 to April 2003, while conducting Operation Deep Freeze in support of the U.S. Antarctic Program. With less than three weeks&#x27; notice, &quot;Healy&quot; was deployed to Antarctica in support of the critical annual re-supply of McMurdo Station. &quot;Healy&quot; played an instrumental role in coordination with &quot;Polar Sea&quot; in resupplying the ice station. &quot;Healy&quot; successfully escorted the freighter and the tanker . &quot;Healy&quot; successfully escorted both ships in and out of the ice, and facilitated the delivery of resources to McMurdo Station.

12 September 2005: &quot;Healy&quot; reached the North Pole for a second time, accompanied by the Swedish icebreaker Oden (1988 icebreaker). This was &quot;Healy&quot; second visit to the North Pole, and the voyage was a part of the Arctic East-West Summer 2005 project which consisted of three cruises between 1 June and 28 November 2005.

16 July 2008: &quot;Healy&quot; received the Coast Guard Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation award for meritorious service from April 2007 to July 2008, while conducting science operations in support of national scientific, economic, and political interests. &quot;Healy&quot; conducted a multi-year project in order to evaluate the entire ecosystem of the Bering Sea. Data collected during these missions helped improve the understanding of food webs and biological communities in the Arctic. Through superior mission execution in adverse weather, &quot;Healy&quot; exceeded expectations significantly.

20 January 2010: &quot;Healy&quot; received the Coast Guard Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation award for meritorious service from 6 August to 16 September 2009, while conducting the Joint U.S.–Canada United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Extended Continental Shelf Mapping Expedition. In collaboration with , &quot;Healy&quot; pushed further north than planned and avoided $2.4 million in future expedition mapping costs. &quot;Healy&quot; also acquired over of valuable geological samples by conducting dredging operations at depths of up to . The rare samples were essential in establishing the origin of the targeted extended continental shelf.

3 January 2012: &quot;Healy&quot; escorted the Russian-flagged freighter &quot;Renda&quot; through pack ice to deliver an emergency supply of fuel to Nome, Alaska. In November 2011, a strong winter storm struck western Alaska, which prevented a vital fuel delivery to Nome. Such a winter delivery had never been attempted before because the ice floes are thick during the winter season. &quot;Healy&quot; delayed her return home from a six-month Arctic deployment in order to escort &quot;Renda&quot; through over of extremely difficult ice conditions and broke out the beset ship time after time. After many days of great exertion, &quot;Renda&quot; transferred the fuel to Nome over the course of three days. On 20 January, &quot;Healy&quot; began the break out for herself and &quot;Renda&quot;. They emerged from the ice on 29 January 2012, after successful completion of the mission. The resupply was vital to the city, and was the first-ever winter fuel delivery from the water in Western Alaska. Over the course of Arctic West Summer 2012 (AWS12), &quot;Healy&quot; travelled over and conducted 687 science casts. &quot;Healy&quot; also added 25% more data to the bathymetric mapping project of the extended continental shelf through multibeam sonar bottom-mapping. This data was collected in support of the delineation of the American and Canadian continental shelves. On April 10th, &quot;Healy&quot; was awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation award for exceptionally meritorious service from 3 January to 5 February 2012.

29 October 2015: &quot;Healy&quot; received the Coast Guard Unit Commendation award for exceptionally meritorious service from 24 June to 29 October 2015, during their Arctic West Summer 2015 deployment. &quot;Healy&quot; traveled over , took over 25,000 water and ice samples from 72 science stations, and became the first unaccompanied U.S. surface vessel to reach the North Pole. She also engaged with the crew of the German icebreaker while at the North Pole, in support of the international scientific mission Geotraces. Finally, &quot;Healy&quot; became the first vessel to broadcast a live feed from ice-bound Arctic waters, streaming video of a search and rescue exercise to shore-based coordinators.

==Recent operations==

2009: A marine biological mission aboard &quot;Healy&quot; studied the ecosystem of the Bering Sea, specifically the sea ice and its future affects on sea life population. The study included a number of biological focuses which recorded seabird and micro zooplankton populations, as well as assessing phytoplankton, sea ice algae, nitrogen, and sediment. Additionally Oceanographer Evelyn Lessard co-led a team to study krill populations to assess how climate change will affect the fisheries.

2011: During Arctic West Summer 2011 (AWS11), &quot;Healy&quot; collaborated with researchers from NASA to study the refractive properties of sunlight in the Arctic. &quot;Healy&quot; spent the summer mapping the Extended Continental Shelf in collaboration with CCGS &quot;Louis S. St-Laurent&quot;. A third mission of this patrol studied organic carbon and its levels in the Arctic water column. This data was used to explain bacteria distribution in the water column as well as carbon dioxide and biomass cycles.

2013: Arctic West Summer 2013 (AWS13) consisted of four different missions for &quot;Healy&quot;, over which more than were covered. The first mission utilized &quot;Healy&quot;″s unique over-the-side science capabilities in order to collect organisms and create an ecological picture of the Hanna Shoal region. The second mission yielded sediment samples from the Mackenzie River Basin through the use of coring devices. For the third mission the Coast Guard Research Development Center, in coordination with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, deployed numerous equipment for testing and development. The fourth and final mission deployed subsurface moorings and conducted numerous CTD tests to study the Alaskan Boundary Current. A group of researchers from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory tested their Submarine Team Behaviors Tool with &quot;Healy&quot;″s crew in September 2013. They were part of the 50 person science team from the USCG Research and Development Center that evaluated technology for the recovery of &quot;simulated oil trapped in or under ice at the polar ice edge&quot;.

2014: A main area of focus during Arctic West Summer 2014 (AWS14) was the study of phytoplankton blooms along the Chukchi Sea. &quot;Healy&quot; also worked in conjunction with the United States Coast Guard Research and Development Center to test Aerostat balloons, UAV, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), and oil tracking buoys.
2015: On 5 September, &quot;Healy&quot; became the first unaccompanied United States surface vessel to reach the North Pole. &quot;Healy&quot; travelled over 16,000 nautical miles during Arctic West Summer 2015 (AWS15). During this expedition, more than 25,000 water and ice samples from 72 science stations were collected through Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) casts and on-ice science stations. &quot;Healy&quot; worked with both the United States Coast Guard Research &amp; Development Center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to test and develop Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV&#x27;s), and became the first vessel to broadcast a live feed from Arctic waters. &quot;Healy&quot; also conducted a professional international engagement with the German Icebreaker Polarstern at the North Pole. It was a historic Arctic deployment that displayed the Coast Guard&#x27;s unique polar capabilities to the public and the world. Between May and October 2015, &quot;Healy&quot; also tested the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) high frequency satellite communication system throughout her Arctic Summer West 2015 mission. Successful tests were completed throughout the expedition during the transit to the North Pole.
2016: On 15 October 2016, &quot;Healy&quot; returned to her home port in Seattle, after a 127-day summer deployment in the Arctic Ocean. The crew of &quot;Healy&quot;, and her accompanying scientists, participated in three scientific studies. Highlights of this deployment include the discovery of new species of jellyfish in the Chukchi Sea, observations of the continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea, and data collection on climate change.

2022: On 30 September 2022, &quot;Healy&quot; and crew reached the North Pole for her 4th time and her 2nd time unaccompanied. The crew assisted a team of NSF-funded scientists as part of the international Synoptic Arctic Survey Program (SAS). The 2022 voyage was facilitated by &quot;unexpectedly&quot; thin ice, multiple leads in the sea ice, and favorable South winds.

2023: In August 2023, &quot;Healy&quot; was undertaking scientific research for the Nansen and Amundsen Basin Observational System (NABOS), including CTD profiles, in the East Siberian Sea. The ship sailed towards the Siberian shelf with an objective of better understanding the physics of the Nansen and Amundsen basins and in doing so, encroached on Russia&#x27;s Northern Sea Route. On September 2nd, the Russian research vessel &quot;Akademik Nemchinov&quot; suddenly diverted north to intercept &quot;Healy&quot;. The vessels were only a few kilometers apart before &quot;Healy&quot; diverted course sharply northeast and abandoned several sampling sites.

==Incidents==

=== 2006 dive mishap ===

On 17 August 2006, Lieutenant Jessica Hill and PO2 Stephen Duque, died of unspecified causes during diving operations in the Arctic Ocean. The Coast Guard conducted simultaneous safety and administrative investigations the results of which were made public in January 2007 along with a Final Decision Letter dated 23 August 2007.

Initial press reports indicated that the divers were conducting an inspection of the rudder - a routine operation - at the time of the accident, but later reports stated that the two were doing a cold-water training dive near the bow of the ship. The dive was reported to have been planned for a maximum depth of . Lieutenant Hill&#x27;s father, citing autopsy reports, has indicated that his daughter actually reached a depth of near in what he described as an out of control descent. The divers were tended by unqualified and poorly-instructed personnel on the surface, none of whom were familiar with cold water diving or scuba diving in general. It is not clear why they extended so much line to the divers. By the time the two could be pulled to the surface, gas reserves were empty and neither diver could be revived.

On 30 August, Commanding Officer Captain Douglas G. Russell, was temporarily relieved of command by Vice Admiral Charles Wuster, citing a &quot;loss of confidence&quot; in Russell&#x27;s ability to command. The relief was later made permanent by Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen.

=== 2020 propulsion motor fire ===

On 18 August 2020, &quot;Healy&quot; suffered an electrical fire that rendered the electric propulsion motor driving the starboard propeller shaft unusable. At the time of the incident, the icebreaker was underway about from Seward, Alaska and headed for Arctic Ocean science operations. The fire was reported at 21:30 and was extinguished within the hour. There were no injuries among the crew but all science operations had to be cancelled and the vessel returned to its home port Seattle on 31 August. 

On 18 October 2020, &quot;Healy&quot; entered a dry dock at the site of the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard where the icebreaker&#x27;s hull was cut open and the damaged 106-tonne propulsion motor replaced by a spare unit shipped from United States Coast Guard Yard on a barge via the Panama Canal. The icebreaker was floated out on 5 January 2021 and returned to Seattle in mid-February. &quot;Healy&quot; returned to service in the following summer.

=== 2024 fire ===

At the end of July 2024, &quot;Healy&quot; suffered another electrical fire that forced the icebreaker to cancel two scientific missions to the Arctic and patrol through the Northwest Passage. Although the fire in one of the ship&#x27;s transformers was extinguished quickly and without casualties, and ship&#x27;s crew and contractors managed to restore power to the affected main propulsion motor, the icebreaker nonetheless returned to its homeport Seattle for repairs.

<doc id="274597" wikidata="Q160173" url="?curid=274597" title="Ruse, Bulgaria">
<text>Ruse (also transliterated as Rousse, Russe; ) is the fifth largest city in Bulgaria. Ruse is in the northeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the Danube, opposite the Romanian city of Giurgiu, approximately south of Bucharest, Romania&#x27;s capital, from Varna, and from the capital Sofia. Thanks to its location and its railway and road bridge over the Danube (Danube Bridge), it is the most significant Bulgarian river port, serving an important part of the international trade of the country. It is the 12th largest of all cities on the Danube river.

Ruse is known for its 19th- and 20th-century Neo-Baroque and Neo-Rococo architecture, which attracts many tourists. It is often called the Little Vienna. The Ruse-Giurgiu Friendship Bridge, until 14 June 2013 the only one in the shared Bulgarian-Romanian section of the Danube, crosses the river here.

Ruse is the birthplace of the Nobel laureate in Literature Elias Canetti and the writer Michael Arlen.

Ruse is on the right bank of the river Danube, which is the high bank, having two underwater terraces and three river terraces at , , and . The average altitude is AMSL. The urban area is an approximately 11-km ellipse running along the river. The city extends from the land-connected Matey () island and the mouth of Rusenski Lom on the west to Srabcheto () hill on the east. During the 20th century, the west end of the city was significantly modified by moving the mouth of Rusenski Lom to the west, as well as by moving the bank itself with its fairway considerably to the north. Sarabair (, from Turkish meaning &quot;Yellow Slope&quot;) hill is to the south of the city and is high. The Rousse TV Tower is built there on the remains of Leventtabia, a former Turkish fortification.

==Geography==
Ruse is located in the northeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the Danube, opposite the Romanian city of Giurgiu, approximately 75 km (47 mi) south of Bucharest, Romania&#x27;s capital, 200 km (124 mi) from the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and 300 km (186 mi) from the capital Sofia.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
Scholars suggest that the city on the river bank derived its present name from the Finnish root &quot;ruskea&quot; meaning &quot;blonde&quot;, or &quot;*ru-&quot; (&quot;river&quot;, &quot;stream&quot;) or from the Cherven fortress, meaning &quot;red&quot;, through the root &quot;rous&quot;, which is present in many Slavic languages.

A popular legend claims that the name &quot;Ruse&quot; comes from Finnish ruskea, or the name of a female founder of the city, whose name was Rusa, meaning &quot;blonde hair&quot;. In the 13th and 14th centuries, during the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire, a fortified settlement called &quot;Rusi&quot;, first mentioned in 1380, emerged near the ruins of the earlier Roman town.

Other theories include settlement by people from the Rus era; a connection to the village of Rusokastro in Burgas Province; an unattested tribe of Getae with a name such as &quot;Riusi&quot;, or; the pagan festival of Rosalia.

=== Antiquity ===
The city emerged from a Neolithic settlement of the 3rd to 2nd millennium BCE, when pottery, fishing, agriculture, and hunting developed. Excavations have revealed several layers, suggesting that the place was attacked by neighbouring tribes and suffered from natural disasters. Ancient sanctuaries were found nearby, where idols of a pregnant woman, a fertility goddess, were prevalent.

The later Thracian settlement developed into a Roman military and naval centre during the reign of Vespasian (69–70 CE), as part of &quot;Limes Moesiae&quot;, the fortification system along the northern boundary of Moesia. Its name, &quot;Sexaginta Prista&quot;, suggests a meaning of &quot;a city of 60 ships&quot; (from  — &quot;60&quot; and  — a special type of guard ship), based on the supposed 60 nearby berths.

The fort was on the main road between Singidunum (modern Belgrade) and the Danube Delta and was destroyed in the 6th century by Avar and Slavic raids. Hungarian historian Felix Philipp Kanitz was the first to identify Sexaginta Prista with Ruse, but the Škorpil brothers demonstrated the link later through studying inscriptions, coins, graves, and objects of daily life. An inscription from the reign of Diocletian proves that the city was rebuilt as a &quot;praesidium&quot; (a large fortification) after it was destroyed by the Goths in 250 CE.

The settlement was mentioned as &quot;Golyamo Yorgovo&quot; in the Middle Ages, whose present successor is Giurgiu in Romania.

=== Ottoman rule ===
During Ottoman rule, the Ottomans destroyed the town, reacting to a 1595 unsuccessful liberation attempt by a joint Vlach-Bulgarian army, led by Michael the Brave. After its rebuilding in the following years, Ruse was dubbed &quot;Rusçuk&quot; (Turkish for &quot;little Ruse&quot;) and had again expanded into a large fortress by the 18th century. It later grew into one of the most important Ottoman towns on the Danube and an administrative centre of Tuna Vilayet, which extended from Varna and Tulcea to Sofia and Niš.

The &quot;Dunav&quot; newspaper appeared — it was the first printed in Bulgaria and in Bulgarian. Some Bulgarian schools were founded. The streets are renamed and numbered for the first time in Bulgarian lands. A post office, hospital, home for the aged were founded. Three empires met here for trading: Austro-Hungary, Russia, British Empire. France and Italy opened consulates in Ruse. The modern city arose from the shades of the settlement. In 1865 the Obraztsov Chiflik was founded on the place where the English Consul&#x27;s farm was; it was the first modern farm on the territory of the whole Ottoman Empire of that time.

Ruse developed into a centre of the Bulgarian National Revival and hosted the headquarters of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee.

=== Early Modern Bulgaria ===

After it became part of modern Bulgaria on 20 February 1878, Ruse was one of the key cultural and economic centres of the country. Intensive building during the period changed the city&#x27;s architectural appearance to a typical Central European one. Ruse is known for the many first innovations in Bulgaria, including:
* 1864 – the first printing office in Bulgaria;
* 1867 – the first railway line linking Ruse and Varna, was launched into operation;
* 1879 – the first agronomical school &quot;Obraztsov chiflik&quot;, today – Agricultural scientific research institute, currently profiled in agriculture and seed science;
* 1881 – the first steel ship in Bulgaria was built;
* 1881 – the first privately owned Bulgarian bank Girdap;
* 1881 – the Machine School for the Navy, the first technical school in Bulgaria. Later it was moved to Varna;
* 1883 – the first Weather station;
* 1884 – the first Bulgarian pharmacy association;
* 1885 – the first Bulgarian technical association was instituted;
* 1890 – the first Chamber of Commerce and Industry;
* 1891 – the first private insurance company &quot;Bulgaria&quot;;
* 1896 – the first manually operated elevator;
* 1897 – the first movie projection. The second was a month later in the capital Sofia;

Ruse had the first Bulgarian factories for soda water, lemonade, and for neckties. The first aviator Simeon Petrov was born in Ruse.

In the newly liberated Bulgaria of the late 19th century, Ruse was a cosmopolitan city with a multiethnic population. According to the first census conducted in 1883, ethnic Bulgarians made up 43% of the population, Turks 39%, and Jews 7%.

&quot;All façades on main streets of Russe shall have rich decorations with plastic stone&quot;, postulate the Regulations for Constructions of Private Buildings of 1893, issued by the Municipality of Russe.

After knyaz Alexander Battenberg&#x27;s 1886 abdication, and as a reaction to the regentship&#x27;s course led by prime minister Stefan Stambolov, a group of Russophile (pro-Russian) military officers revolted in Ruse. The riot was violently crushed, and 13 of the leaders were quickly sentenced to death and executed near the city, which caused much public discontent. Decades later, in 1934, local citizens raised funds and built a monument at the place where the Russophile officers were executed. The monument was blown up in 1940 but rebuilt in 1966 at approximately the same spot.

=== Early 20th century ===

* 1908 – The first factory for iron beds in Modern Bulgaria. Today Ruse is a major centre of furniture manufacturing.
* 1911 was marked off with the start of a project for an electrical station by &quot;Siemens-Schukert&quot;. On 17 February 1917 Ruse became the third electrified city in the country (after Sofia and Varna).
* In 1913 Belgian entrepreneurs and engineers were granted a concession for a period of 25 years and built the largest sugar factory in Bulgaria.

* 1927 – the first sock-making factory in Bulgaria opened in Ruse. &quot;Fazan&quot; still exists today;
* 1933 – the first oil refinery was constructed;

Between World War I and II, after Southern Dobruja was lost to Romania, the economic significance of the city decreased. So did the population: Ruse was no longer the second-largest city in Bulgaria (after former East Rumelian capital Plovdiv), being quickly surpassed by Sofia and Varna. Foreign consulates were closed, except for the Russian one, which remained functional until 2022. Only for the period between 1919 and 1920 the capital loss is estimated at around 40 million leva.

=== World War II period ===
The return of Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria in September 1940 fostered good conditions for the restoration of the city&#x27;s leading role. It became a provincial centre, and economic activity revived. Typical for the post-war architecture of the city was the wide use of iron, concrete and glass as construction materials. Examples are the River port – 1931, the Freight station – 1935, Market Hall – 1939 and the Court house – 1940.

=== Communist period ===

The construction of the Ruse-Giurgiu bridge in 1954 and the fast industrialization gave a new push to development. Ruse emerged again as an important economic, transport, cultural, and education hub. Engineering, chemical, and light industries expanded; a large harbor was built, and the city became a university centre. At the 1985 census, a population of more than 186,000 was reported.

In the early 1980s, Ruse entered a dark period. The Verachim factory was built in Giurgiu, which polluted the air between 1980 and 1991, impacting the city&#x27;s development. The population decreased, and 15,000 people moved out between 1985 and 1992. The first informal organization in Bulgaria under the communist regime was established here - The Public Committee for Environmental Protection of Ruse, which provoked the first nationwide demonstrations and strongly influenced the change to democracy. In 1991, the Romanian factory ceased the pollution, after the fall of the communist regime in Romania.

=== Democratic Bulgaria ===

Like other post-socialist regimes in eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the transition to capitalism rather painful and not as easy as expected. State-owned enterprises lost their former markets and could not adapt to the now free-market competition. This led to massive unemployment in the city and emigration waves in the 90s. Since 2000, Ruse has been continually regaining its former leading status. The urban economics were positively influenced by the 2007&#x27;s accession of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Union, which allowed deeper cross-border cooperation. The flow of investments through EU funds restarted long suspended projects which were finally completed.

After decades of construction, the new corpus of the University of Ruse was inaugurated in 2010.

In 2011 the city&#x27;s centre was renovated through an EU project, worth 10 million leva. Included in the project, a Dry Deck Fountain was introduced in an urban environment for the first time in Bulgaria. The exterior of the Rousse State Opera was reconditioned.

A water treatment facility, an investment worth 57 million Euro, is now functional.

In 2012 the Rousse Regional Historical Museum completed a project, which allowed the rehabilitation and display of the remains of the Roman city Sexaginta Prista.

Ignat Kaneff, a Bulgarian-born Canadian business magnate, endowed about half of the amount necessary for the construction of a modern conference complex named after him, the Kaneff Centre, at the University of Ruse. It was officially opened on 10 October 2013.

A landmark event for the city was the opening of the new Eco Museum &amp; Aquarium in 2014.

A safer and more efficient navigation in the inland waterways was accomplished with a new structure – the river information system BulRIS. A modern oncology centre is now operating.

Ruse was a candidate for a European Capital of Culture in 2019 with the concept &quot;Free spirit city&quot;.

Dohodno zdanie, an imposing Neoclassical edifice in the city centre convincingly won the National competition &quot;Emblematic building of the year&quot; in 2014. Ruse was a host city of the first of its kind in Bulgaria – an International Ice Figures Festival.

The Arena Ruse sports hall with more than 5100 seats opened on 23 July 2015 nearly 40 years after initial construction efforts began. The project was suspended on numerous occasions due to a lack of financing. An underground parking inside the sports hall has also been completed.

On-going projects are the re-cultivation of the old landfill, worth 22,5 million leva. The biggest roundabout in the city with underpasses for pedestrians and cyclists, worth some 10 million leva was reconstructed.

=== Transportation ===

Ruse is a major road and railway hub in Northern Bulgaria. Railway transportation in the city dates back to 1867 when it became a station of the first railway line in Bulgaria Ruse – Varna. There are railways to Southern Bulgaria, Sofia, Varna and Bucharest. Ruse has two railway stations for passenger services (Ruse Central and Ruse Razpredelitelna) and two for freight transport services. There are intercity buses that link Ruse with cities and towns all over the country, as well as in other European nations. They are based in two bus stations: South and East.

Ruse has an extensive public transport system with 25 bus and trolleybus lines, including the Ruse trolleybus system. Since the sale of all shares of the private Israeli transport holding Egged Ruse to the local municipality in 2017, trolleybus lines have been operated by the city&#x27;s own public transport entity. Since July 2024, urban bus lines are also operated by the municipal public transport entity. Suburban bus lines remain under concession to various private Bulgarian transport companies. A 14 kilometer bicycle network along the main boulevards of the city has been developed and is currently in the process of expansion.

Approximately southeast of Ruse is the village of Shtraklevo, near which is the former military and passenger Ruse Airport. It is owned by the municipality of Ruse, with an active license for small passenger and cargo flights (license issued on 21.12.2016). The runway is long enough for Boeing 747s (Jumbo Jets). The Henri Coandă International Airport in Otopeni, Romania is north of Ruse.

The Danube bridge is located east of Ruse. It was the only road and rail bridge between Bulgaria and Romania until the opening of a second bridge crossing to Romania on 14 June 2013 at Vidin.

Ruse is the biggest Bulgarian port on the banks of the Danube River. After the opening of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal which covers and connects 13 European countries with Asia via the Black Sea, the river becomes the longest inland waterway on the planet. This key position has determined the 19th century-long co-existence of different cultures and religions in Ruse.
