<text>Anil Kumble (; born 17 October 1970) is a former Indian cricketer, coach and commentator who played Test and One Day International cricket for his national team over an international career of 18 years. A right-arm leg spin bowler, regarded as one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history, he took 619 wickets in Test cricket and was the third-highest wicket taker of all time at the time of his retirement in 2008. 

Born in Bangalore, Mysore State (now Karnataka), Kumble developed an early interest in cricket as he grew up watching players like B. S. Chandrasekhar before becoming a full-fledged cricketer. He made his first-class debut at the age of 19 while representing Karnataka. Soon he was picked up for the Austral-Asia Cup in 1990 before making his Test debut against England later that year. Since then, he played 132 Test matches and was responsible for many of India&#x27;s victories. In 1999, while playing against Pakistan, Kumble dismissed all ten batsmen in a Test match innings, joining England&#x27;s Jim Laker as the second player to achieve the feat. He became a part of the regular ODI team during the early 1990s and had some of the best performances during this time. The year 1996 proved to very successful for him as he was selected for the World Cup and emerged as the most successful bowler of the tournament, taking 15 wickets in seven matches at an average of 18.73.

Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not a big turner of the ball, but relied primarily on pace, bounce, and accuracy. He was nicknamed &quot;Jumbo&quot;, as his deliveries, for a spinner, were &quot;as fast as a jumbo jet&quot;. He was selected as the Cricketer of the Year in 1993 &quot;Indian Cricket&quot;, and one of the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year three years later. He was a member of the Indian team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, where the title was shared with Sri Lanka.

Kumble was awarded the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth-highest civilian honour in 2005. After having played for 18 years, he announced his retirement from international cricket in November 2008. In October 2012, he was appointed the chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC)&#x27;s cricket committee.

Between 2012 and 2015, Kumble held positions as a chief mentor for the teams Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. In February 2015, he became the fourth Indian cricketer to be inducted into ICC Hall of Fame. He also served as the head coach of the Indian cricket team between 2016 and 2017. From 2020 to 2022, he served as the head coach and the director of cricket operations of the IPL team Punjab Kings.

==Career==
===Early domestic career and international career ===

Kumble made his first-class debut for Karnataka against Hyderabad on 30 November 1989, taking 4 wickets and bagging a king pair. He was then selected for India Under-19s against Pakistan Under-19s, scoring 113 in the first test and 76 in the second. He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka at Sharjah in the Austral-Asia Cup on 25 April 1990. He played one more game in the series against Pakistan and ended up picking two wickets. His Test debut came in the same year when India toured England for a three-test series. It was the second test of the series played at Manchester and he picked up 3 wickets conceding 105 runs in the first innings and went wicket-less in the second innings of the match which resulted in a draw. He did not play any Tests until 1992. He picked up 13/138 in Irani Trophy against Delhi for Rest of India which ensured the latter&#x27;s victory. This performance helped him earn a place in the Indian side that toured South Africa and Zimbabwe. It was during the 1992 Indian tour of South Africa that he established himself as a quality spinner, taking eight wickets in the second Test. He took 18 wickets at an average of 25.94 and with an economy rate of 1.84 in the four-test series. Later that year, when England toured India, Kumble took 21 wickets in three Tests at an average of 19.8. He picked up seven wickets for 165 runs in the third Test of the series played at Bombay as India went on to win the match by an innings and 15 runs. He was adjudged man of the match for his performance.

Kumble took his first 50 Test wickets in 10 matches; the record remained the fastest by an Indian bowler, until Ravichandran Ashwin surpassed him by achieving the feat in nine matches. His 100 Test wickets in 21 Test matches, the second fastest by an Indian bowler after Erapalli Prasanna (who took 100 wickets in 20 matches). On 27 November 1993, he took six wickets for 12 runs in an ODI against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, Calcutta in the final of the Hero Cup, which was the best ODI bowling record by an Indian for very long time, before it was broken by Stuart Binny on 17 June 2014 against Bangladesh. In January 1994, when Sri Lanka toured India, Kumble picked up his first 10 wicket haul in his 14th match which ensured India&#x27;s victory by an innings and 119 runs. He picked up 11 wickets for 128 runs in the match.

In 1995 English cricket season Kumble played for Northamptonshire and was the leading wicket taker with 105 wickets at the average of 20.40. He was the only bowler to take more than 100 wickets during that season. His best performance came against Hampshire in a drawn match in County Championship, picking up 13 wickets for 192 runs. This performance in the English county cricket was noted by Wisden as they named him one of their five Cricketers of the Year in 1996.

===1996 World Cup===
The year 1996 proved to be extremely successful for Kumble as he claimed 61 ODI wickets at an average of 20.24. All in all, he was the leading wicket-taker in the calendar year with 90 wickets at an average of 24.14 in Tests and ODIs combined. He was selected in the Indian side for the 1996 World Cup. He was a part of all the seven matches that India played, and was the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 15 wickets at an average of 18.73. India played their first match against Kenya where he took three for 28 runs, which helped to restrict Kenya for just 199/6 in their 50 overs. India won the match comfortably by seven wickets. In the subsequent matches he picked up three for 35 runs (against West Indies) and two wickets for 39 runs (against Sri Lanka) in group phase.

India played against Pakistan in the quarter-final phase, where Kumble picked up 3 for 48 in the match which India eventually won. In the semi-final they subsequently lost to Sri Lanka in which his performance was 1 for 51.

===Setting records and rise through the ranks===

In October 1996, Kumble along with Javagal Srinath helped India to win a scintillating ODI match against Australia in Bangalore in the Titan Cup. The duo added 52 runs for 9th wicket partnership, after Sachin Tendulkar got out at 88 when India was 164/8, chasing a target of 216 runs. India eventually went on to win the Titan Cup. In February 1997 India visited the West Indies for a series of five tests and four ODIs. Kumble was part of the squad and he was the leading wicket-taker in the Test series. He picked up 19 wickets, averaging 30.31 with the ball. Kumble was the leading wicket-taker by a large margin when Australia visited India for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 1998. He picked up 23 wickets in 3 test matches at the average of 18.26.

Kumble is one of three bowlers ever (the other two being Jim Laker of England in 1956 and later, Ajaz Patel of New Zealand in 2021) to have taken all ten wickets in a Test innings, taking 10 for 74 runs. He achieved this against Pakistan in the second Test played in Delhi in February 1999. It has been said that once he had got nine wickets, his friend and teammate Javagal Srinath started deliberately bowling wide outside the off stump, so that Kumble could take the tenth wicket. In an interview via 10 Sports, former opener Sadagoppan Ramesh revealed that in that match, when he tried to catch Waqar Younis off Srinath&#x27;s bowling, Srinath cautioned him to drop the catch, saying that &quot;he had no business going after that catch&quot;. The performance was rated by &quot;Wisden&quot; as the second best bowling performance of all time, and the achievement was commemorated by naming a traffic circle in Bengaluru after him and gifting him a car with the customised licence plate: KA-10-N-10. The performance was rated by &quot;Wisden&quot; as the second best bowling performance of all time.In 1999 he was the third highest wicket taker with 88 wickets at the average of 30.03 behind Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne. 

On 6 October 2004, Kumble became only the third spinner in the history of Test cricket after Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan and the second Indian bowler after Kapil Dev to capture 400 Test wickets. Reaching the mark took him 30 fewer Test matches than Dev, and 7 fewer than Warne. In the India-West Indies series of 2006, Kumble took 6–78 in the second innings of the final Test in Sabina Park, Jamaica, and bowled India to a historic series win. During the first innings of the match, Kumble scored 45 and became the second player in the history of the game after Warne to score 2000 runs and take over 500 Test wickets. He also holds the world record for trapping most batsmen leg before wicket. On 10 December 2004, Kumble became India&#x27;s highest wicket-taker when he trapped Mohammad Rafique of Bangladesh to surpass Kapil Dev&#x27;s haul of 434 wickets.

Kumble also played for ACC Asian XI against ICC World XI in the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal ODI match on 10 January 2005 held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground which was organised for the charity purpose for 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami victims. In the match, he picked up 2/73 and scored 11 runs off 7 balls. For his performances in 2005, he was named as 12th man in the World Test XI by ICC.

Kumble claimed his 500th Test wicket in the second Test of England&#x27;s tour of India in March 2006, when he dismissed Steve Harmison leg before wicket. He became the first Indian and fifth overall to reach the mark. After returning to India from the 2007 World Cup, he announced his retirement from ODIs on 30 March.

On 10 August that year, Kumble scored his maiden Test century, making an unbeaten 110 against England at the Oval to help his team finish with 664. He took 117 Tests to reach his maiden Test hundred, which is a record for taking the most matches to score a century, beating Chaminda Vaas who had held this record previously with 96 Tests. It was also the only hundred by an Indian in the three-Test series. He is the only Test cricketer to have taken all ten wickets in an innings and score a Test hundred in his career. A day after scoring his ton, Kumble dismissed Michael Vaughan for his 900th International wicket and 563rd Test wicket, drawing him level with McGrath. Later he trapped Monty Panesar leg before wicket to finish the innings and overtake McGrath in the list of all-time wicket-takers. 

Kumble has bowled 40850 balls in his entire Test career, which is the second highest after Muttiah Muralitharan&#x27;s 44039 balls.

Kumble was appointed as the captain of the Indian Test team on 8 November 2007. He succeeded his state teammate Rahul Dravid, who resigned as the captain in September 2007. He is the only leg spinner who have become the captain of the team. His first series as captain was a three-match home series against Pakistan, which India won 1–0.
On 17 January 2008, in the third Test against Australia at WACA, Perth, Kumble became the first Indian bowler and the third in the world to reach the milestone of 600 Test wickets. Kumble achieved the record just after the tea break when he had Andrew Symonds caught by Rahul Dravid at first slip. Kumble&#x27;s 600 wickets came in 124 matches at an average of 28.68. Kumble has captured most wickets against Australia by an Indian bowler. Kumble is the third bowler after Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne to take 600 Test wickets.

===Retirement from international cricket===
Kumble injured the little finger of his left hand while attempting a catch off Matthew Hayden in Australia&#x27;s first innings which rendered him unfit for the 4th and final test of the series against Australia in November 2008. He was finding it difficult to find his striking form and went wicketless in four consecutive innings before the first innings of Australia in the third test of the series against Australia in which he managed three lower-order wickets. He declared the 2nd innings of India with only 6 overs of play left in the drawn match. His final figures were 4–0–14–0.

Kumble announced his retirement from Test, first-class, and List A cricket on 2 November 2008 in the third Test match against Australia at Feroz Shah Kotla cricket stadium at New Delhi, India. He dismissed Mitchell Johnson as his last Test wicket. The final ball of his test career was a low full toss on which Hayden scored a four. After his retirement, MS Dhoni was made the captain of the team.

===IPL career===
Kumble agreed to honour his contract with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) franchise of the Indian Premier League after retirement. He was given a three-year contract worth US$500,000 per year in the first round of bidding in 2008.

On 18 April 2009 he took a five-wicket haul conceding just 5 runs in 3.1 overs against the defending champions Rajasthan Royals, which helped RCB get a 75-run victory in the second match of the 2009 edition, played in South Africa. Even today, this remains the fourth-best bowling figures in IPL history. After the departure of Kevin Pietersen for England&#x27;s cricket commitments, Kumble was named as the captain of the team. On 23 May 2009, RCB defeated the Chennai Super Kings by six wickets and earned a spot in the final against the Deccan Chargers. RCB lost the finals but Kumble won Man of the Match, and is the only person in IPL history to win Man of the Match in the final despite being on the losing side. Though RCB could not win the tournament, Kumble ended as the most successful spin bowler and the 2nd highest wicket-taker of the tournament with 21 wickets at an economy rate of 5.86 runs per over behind R. P. Singh.

In 2010 Indian Premier League, Kumble led the team to the semi-finals. After being forced to play their semi-finals at the DY Patil Stadium following security concerns in Bangalore, the Royal Challengers lost their semi-final to the Mumbai Indians with Kumble taking 1 wicket at an economy rate of 7.50 in the match. For his performances in 2010, he was named in the ESPNcricinfo IPL XI.

Kumble announced his retirement from Indian Premier League on 4 January 2011. After his retirement from IPL as a player, RCB appointed him as the chief mentor for the team, where he led them to the 2011 final against the Chennai Super Kings. Kumble left that position in January 2013, moving to a similar role with the Mumbai Indians, which he quit in November 2015 after delivering them 2 titles in alternative years. He then served as the director of operations for the Punjab Kings from 2020 to 2022.

==Style and technique==

Kumble was a right-arm leg spin bowler (legbreak googly) with an unorthodox style, most famous for his flipper. He started his career as a fast bowler, which gave him a useful faster delivery. His unique bowling style can be attributed to matting pitches in Bangalore which assist top-spin and over-spin.

Kumble was one of the 4 bowlers, alongside Richard Hadlee, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan (later Rangana Herath, James Anderson, Ravichandran Ashwin), and (then) the only Indian bowler ever, to have taken 5 wickets in a Test innings more than 30 times. He also holds the world record for the largest number of caught-and-bowled dismissals in Tests, 35 – which forms 5.65% of his total wickets. He is also one of 4 Indian bowlers to have conceded over 250 runs in a Test match, although he took 12 wickets in that match. He is known for bowling tirelessly, having bowled 72 overs in a Test innings once. He is also remembered for his tenacity in bowling even when injured, especially after an incident in a 2002 Test match against the West Indies in Antigua, where despite having his jaw fractured by a Mervyn Dillon delivery, he bandaged himself, came back to bowl, and took the wicket of Brian Lara.

Kumble relied more on accuracy, variations and bounce rather than spinning the ball. Sambit Bal, the editor of ESPNcricinfo, wrote, &quot;That he [Kumble] has been an unusual spinner has been said many times before. It has also been said, a trifle unfairly, that he is a unidimensional bowler. Palpably, he has lacked the turn of Warne and Murali, but his variety has been subtler, far more apparent to batsmen than to viewers. He has shown that not only turn and flight that can deceive the batsman but also the changes of length and pace. He has been a cultured practitioner of his unique craft and a master of nuances.&quot;

As a captain and coach, he is a firm supporter of DRS.

==Involvement in cricket associations==
Kumble has been appointed to the athlete&#x27;s commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), with his term starting on 1 January 2009.

On 21 November 2010, Kumble was elected as the President of the Karnataka State Cricket Association, with former teammates Venkatesh Prasad elected as Vice-President and Javagal Srinath elected as Secretary.

On 12 October 2012, Kumble was appointed as the new chairman of the ICC Cricket Committee. He was later retained for another three years on 2 March 2019.

==Coaching career==
On 24 June 2016, Kumble was appointed as the head coach of the Indian men&#x27;s cricket team by the BCCI for a period of one year. His first series as a coach was against the West Indies in July where India played four Test matches, winning 2–0. Later India beat New Zealand 3–0 in the Test series, his second consecutive Test series win as a coach. India also defeated England 4–0 in the five-Test series in November–December and stretched their winning streak to three Test series victory. The next Test series win came against Bangladesh. India went on to dominate on their home soil which marked a 19-match unbeaten record in Tests. 

During the four-match Test series against Australia in March, India lost the first match but made a sensational comeback, beating the Australians in two of the last three Tests, drawing one match and winning the series 2–1. India also registered two ODI series wins in Kumble&#x27;s tenure, as India defeated New Zealand in a five ODI match series 3–2, followed by a 2–1 win over England in a three-match series.

On 20 June 2017, Kumble resigned from the post of head coach due to untenable differences with the then captain, Virat Kohli. His tenure ended after the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, where India lost to Pakistan in the final. 

In October 2019, he was appointed as the head coach and the director of cricket operations for Kings XI Punjab. In August 2022, Punjab Kings decided not to renew his contract.

<doc id="274601" wikidata="Q5211041" url="?curid=274601" title="Dalit theology">
<text>Dalit theology is a branch of Christian theology that emerged among the Dalit caste in the Indian subcontinent in the 1980s. It shares a number of themes with Latin American liberation theology, which arose two decades earlier, including a self-identity as a people undergoing Exodus. Dalit theology sees hope in the &quot;Nazareth Manifesto&quot; of , where Jesus speaks of preaching &quot;good news to the poor ... freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind&quot; and of releasing &quot;the oppressed.&quot;

==Development==
A major proponent of Dalit theology was Arvind P. Nirmal (1936–1995), a Dalit Christian in the Church of North India. Nirmal criticised Brahminic dominance of Christian theology in India, and believed that the application of liberation theology to India should reflect the struggle of Dalits, who make up about 70% of the Christians in India, as claimed by Poor Christian Liberation Movement (PCLM), and 90% of the Christians in Pakistan. Nirmal also criticised the Marxist element within South American liberation theology. Nirmal drew on the concept of the Suffering Servant in to identify Jesus himself as a Dalit – &quot;a waiter, a &quot;dhobi&quot;, and &quot;bhangi&quot;.&quot;

Evelyn Ruth Bhajan, a deacon in the Church of Pakistan, stated that Dalit theology is vital in that it aligns the Church&#x27;s mission with &quot;strategies based on the social, political and economic implications of liberation in Christ.&quot; Bhajan stated that this liberation includes that from persecution, segregation, and economic depression.

Dalit theologians have seen passages in the gospels, such as Jesus&#x27; sharing a common drinking vessel with the Samaritan woman in as indicating his embracing of Dalitness. The parable of the Good Samaritan is also seen as significant, providing a &quot;life-giving message to the marginalized Dalits and a challenging message to the non-Dalits.&quot;

M. E. Prabhakar expanded on the Dalitness of Jesus, stating that &quot;the God of the Dalits ... does not create others to do servile work, but does servile work Himself.&quot; He also suggested that Jesus experienced human, and especially Dalit, brokenness in his crucifixion. Prabhakar has developed a Dalit creed, which reads in part:

&quot;Our cries for liberation from harsh caste-bondage
Were heard by God, who came to us in Jesus Christ
To live with us and save all people from their sins.&quot;
Vedanayagam Devasahayam (b. 1949) of the Church of South India followed Nirmal as head of Dalit theology at the Gurukul Lutheran Theological College, and further developed Nirmal&#x27;s ideas, writing a number of books. Devasahayam later became bishop of the Church of South India&#x27;s Madras Diocese.

Dalit theology opposes indigenization movements within Indian Christian liturgy, since these are seen as reinforcing traditional caste hierarchies. However, the incorporation of some Indian religious traditions is supported.

Stringer decided to attend Ohio State University, where he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1992 to 1994. His Buckeyes teammates included offensive tackle Orlando Pace and running backs Eddie George and Robert Smith. As a junior in 1994, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American.

==Professional career==

The Minnesota Vikings drafted Stringer in the first round (24th pick overall) of the 1995 NFL draft. He played for the Vikings from to . He was a standout on the offensive line, earning Pro Bowl honors in what turned out to be his final season in 2000. In six NFL seasons, he played in 93 regular season games and started 91 of them. As a professional player, Stringer was well-liked inside the locker room and out; after a Vikings game, he stopped to help a fan change a flat tire, and he impulsively signed over his Pro Bowl appearance check to a youth football program in his hometown of Warren.

===Death at training camp===
Stringer suffered from heat stroke on the second day of the Vikings 2001 preseason training camp and died on August 1, 2001, as a result of complications. He was unable to complete the first practice session, held the morning of July 30, due to exhaustion, and did not participate in that day&#x27;s afternoon session, but he vowed to return the next day to complete the morning session, which was conducted in full pads. Although he vomited three times, he did complete the morning practice session on July 31, which lasted 2 hours, but walked to an air-conditioned shelter after the session, where he became weak and dizzy. Offensive line coach Mike Tice stated that he had not witnessed Stringer vomiting, and that Stringer did not exhibit any symptoms of heat-related illness. At 11:30 am, when practice ended, the heat index had reached 99 °F; the heat index peaked later that day at with a high temperature of .

When he was taken to Immanuel St. Joseph&#x27;s–Mayo Health System hospital, his body temperature was upon arrival. Stringer was unconscious from the time he was admitted until his death at 1:50 am on August 1. An autopsy confirmed that Stringer died from organ failure resulting from heat stroke.

The Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MNOSHA) investigated Stringer&#x27;s death and cleared the Vikings of responsibility on November 1, 2001. The Vice President of the Vikings, Mike Kelly, met with MNOSHA officials along with the team&#x27;s athletic trainer and equipment manager. However, under the governing labor laws, the Vikings would only be held liable if it was proven they were negligent or had inflicted intentional harm. Although the autopsy confirmed that Stringer was not taking supplements, the Vikings began preparing a defense to a planned lawsuit in November 2001 by announcing that Stringer&#x27;s locker was full of dietary supplements, including some that contained ephedra.

===Legacy===
The Vikings retired his jersey number 77 on November 19, 2001, during the halftime of a Monday night game with the New York Giants in the season.

Stringer&#x27;s widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the team and trainers in February 2002. The athletic trainers were granted summary judgment for immunity, which was upheld on initial appeal as well as a second appeal to the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Parts of her lawsuit were later thrown out; another suit against the NFL was filed in July 2003 and settled in January 2009. The only disclosed term of the settlement is that the NFL will support efforts to create a heat illness prevention program. His widow also brought a lawsuit against Riddell Inc., the manufacturer of Stringer&#x27;s pads and helmet. In July 2009, a federal judge determined that Riddell had a duty to inform Stringer that their equipment could contribute to heat injuries. A district court judge then ordered a jury trial regarding the matter.

Stringer&#x27;s death brought about major changes regarding heat stroke prevention throughout the NFL. His death also addressed complications of pressuring players to &quot;bulk up&quot; to well over . Stringer, who at the time of his death was and weighed , was at the lowest weight he had ever been in his pro career. Many professional football teams now train in light color uniforms, water and shade are made readily available, and a team doctor is at practice sessions at all times.

Korey&#x27;s wife Kelci worked to establish an exertional heat stroke prevention institute to honor her husband&#x27;s legacy. On April 23, 2010, the NFL and Gatorade joined the University of Connecticut to announce the creation of the Korey Stringer Institute (KSI), a not-for-profit organization housed at the University of Connecticut dedicated to the prevention of sudden death in sports, with a focus on exertional heat stroke (EHS). KSI stems from the 2009 settlement, with Kelci Stringer teaming up with EHS expert, Dr. Douglas Casa, from the University of Connecticut, and the NFL. The mission of the Korey Stringer Institute is to provide research, education, advocacy and consultation to maximize performance, optimize safety and prevent sudden death for the athlete, warfighter and laborer.

On the 20th anniversary of his stroke, Korey&#x27;s brother, Kevin, said &quot;Any time there is a major change in how society does things, it&#x27;s typically because somebody died or got hurt in some way, shape or form. I guess Korey&#x27;s death was my family&#x27;s turn to pay that cost. It bothers me sometimes if I hear of somebody having a heat-related injury, but I know even if that happens, there is more awareness of what to do. It took a while to get there, but we did.&quot;

<text>George Catlin (July 26, 1796 – December 23, 1872) was an American lawyer, painter, author, and traveler, who specialized in portraits of Native Americans in the American frontier. Traveling to the American West five times during the 1830s, Catlin wrote about and painted portraits that depicted the life of the Plains Indians. His early work included engravings, drawn from nature, of sites along the route of the Erie Canal in New York State. Several of his renderings were published in one of the first printed books to use lithography, Cadwallader D. Colden&#x27;s &quot;Memoir, Prepared at the Request of a Committee of the Common Council of the City of New York, and Presented to the Mayor of the City, at the Celebration of the Completion of the New York Canals&quot;, published in 1825, with early images of the City of Buffalo.

==Early life and education==

Catlin was born in 1796 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. While growing up, George encountered &quot;trappers, hunters, explorers and settlers who stayed with his family on their travels west.&quot; Catlin was also intrigued by stories told to him by his mother, Polly Sutton, who had been captured by Indians during the 1778 Battle of Wyoming in Pennsylvania. Like his father, Catlin trained at Litchfield Law School when he was 17, although he disliked the field of law. He was admitted to the Bar in 1819 and practiced law for two years before giving it up to travel and study art.

In 1823, he studied art in Philadelphia and became known for his work as a portraitist. After a meeting with &quot;tribal delegation of Indians from the western frontier, Catlin became eager to preserve a record of Native American customs and individuals.&quot;

==Career==
===Travels===

Catlin began his journey in 1830 when he accompanied Governor William Clark on a diplomatic mission up the Mississippi River into Native American territory. St. Louis became Catlin&#x27;s base of operations for five trips he took between 1830 and 1836, eventually visiting fifty tribes. Two years later he ascended the Missouri River more than 3000 km (1900 miles) to Fort Union Trading Post, near what is now the North Dakota-Montana border, where he spent several weeks among indigenous people who were still relatively untouched by European culture. 

He visited eighteen tribes, including the Pawnee, Omaha, and Ponca in the south and the Mandan, Hidatsa, Cheyenne, Crow, Assiniboine, and Blackfeet to the north. There he produced the most vivid and penetrating portraits of his career. During later trips along the Arkansas, Red, and Mississippi rivers, as well as visits to Florida and the Great Lakes, he produced more than 500 paintings and gathered a substantial collection of artifacts.

===Indigenous gallery===
When Catlin returned east in 1838, he assembled the paintings and numerous artifacts into his Indian Gallery, and began delivering public lectures that drew on his personal recollections of life among the American Indians. Catlin traveled with his Indian Gallery to major cities such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and New York City. He hung his paintings salon style, side by side and one above another. Visitors identified each painting by the number on the frame, as listed in Catlin&#x27;s catalogue. Soon after, he began a lifelong effort to sell his collection to the U.S. government. The touring Indian Gallery did not attract the paying public Catlin needed to stay financially sound, and the United States Congress rejected his initial petition to purchase the works.

In 1839, Catlin took his collection across the Atlantic for a tour of European capitals. As a showman and entrepreneur, he initially attracted crowds to his Indian Gallery in London, Brussels, and Paris. The French critic Charles Baudelaire remarked on Catlin&#x27;s paintings, &quot;He has brought back alive the proud and free characters of these chiefs, both their nobility and manliness.&quot;

Catlin wanted to sell his Indian Gallery to the U.S. government to have his life&#x27;s work preserved intact. His continued attempts to persuade various officials in Washington, D.C. to buy the collection failed. In 1852, he was forced to sell the original Indian Gallery, now 607 paintings, due to personal debts. The industrialist Joseph Harrison acquired the paintings and artifacts, which he stored in a factory in Philadelphia, as security.

Catlin spent the last 20 years of his life trying to re-create his collection, and recreated more than 400 paintings. This second collection of paintings is known as the &quot;Cartoon Collection&quot;, since the works are based on the outlines he drew of the works from the 1830s.

In 1841, Catlin published &quot;Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North American Indians&quot;, in two volumes, with approximately 300 engravings. Three years later he published 25 plates, entitled &quot;Catlin&#x27;s North American Indian Portfolio,&quot; and, in 1848, &quot;Eight Years&#x27; Travels and Residence in Europe&quot;.

From 1852 to 1857, he traveled through South and Central America and later returned for further exploration in the American West Coast. The record of these later years is contained in &quot;Last Rambles amongst the Indians of the Rocky Mountains and the Andes&quot; (1868) and &quot;My Life among the Indians&quot; (ed. by N. G. Humphreys, 1909). Paintings of his Spanish American Indians are published.

In 1872, Catlin traveled to Washington, D.C. at the invitation of Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the Smithsonian. Until his death later that year in Jersey City, New Jersey, Catlin worked in a studio at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s &quot;Castle&quot;. In 1879, Harrison&#x27;s widow donated his original Indian Gallery, more than 500 works, along with related artifacts, to the Smithsonian.

The nearly complete surviving set of Catlin&#x27;s first Indian Gallery, painted in the 1830s, is now part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s collection. The associated Catlin artifacts are in the collections of the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian. Some 700 sketches are held by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Some artifacts from Catlin are in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology collections. The Huntington Library in San Marino, California also holds 239 of Catlin&#x27;s illustrations of both North and South American Indians, and other illustrative and manuscript material by Catlin.

The accuracy of some of Catlin&#x27;s observations has been questioned. He claimed to be the first white man to see the Minnesota pipestone quarries, and pipestone was named catlinite. Catlin exaggerated various features of the site, and his boastful account of his visit aroused his critics, who disputed his claim of being the first white man to investigate the quarry. Previous recorded white visitors include the Groselliers and Radisson, Father Louis Hennepin, Baron de Lahontan, and others. Lewis and Clark noted the pipestone quarry in their journals in 1805. The fur trader Philander Prescott had written another account of the area in 1831.

== Later works ==
After the sale of Catlin&#x27;s Indian Gallery was rebuffed by the U.S. Congress in May 1838, Catlin felt he could find a more receptive audience in Europe and moved his family to England in November 1839, then to Paris in 1845, and eventually lived in some obscurity in Ostend.

Le Chat d&#x27;Ostende is one of the most unusual paintings in Catlin&#x27;s later oeuvre, dated 1868 and inscribed with the title on the stretcher. It has been called &quot;a folky depiction of a playful cat that bore much of the same technique, wonderment and enthusiasm exhibited in the artist&#x27;s later depiction of Native Americans.&quot; In 1871, after an absence of more than three decades, Catlin returned to the United States and likely brought back the painting with him. 

It resurfaced in 1957 in the private collection of Lee B. Anderson, a pioneer collector of American art, and was subsequently sold at Christies for $47,000 on 24 May 2000. The painting reflects a playful quiet domesticity that contrasts sharply from the American bison that thundered across the Great Plains of the American West in the millions. The majestic long-haired cat itself bears some resemblance to a bison and exhibits a human-like face that may be a self-portrait given the play on words inherent in the subject matter and the artist&#x27;s surname.

==Observations on Native mouth breathing practices==
Catlin is also remembered for his research and writing on mouth breathing, inspired by observations made during his travels. This interest is linked to his non-fiction work, &quot;The Breath of Life&quot;, later retitled as &quot;Shut Your Mouth and Save Your Life&quot;, in 1862. It was based on his experiences traveling through the West, where he observed a consistent lifestyle habit among all of the Native American communities he encountered: a preference for nose breathing over mouth breathing. He also observed that they had perfectly straight teeth. 

He repeatedly heard that this was because they believed that mouth breathing made an individual weak and caused disease, while nasal breathing made the body strong and prevented disease. He observed that mothers repeatedly closed the mouth of their infants while they were sleeping, in order to instill nasal breathing as a habit. He wrote the book to document these observations, stating that &quot;there is no person in society but who will find... improvement in health and enjoyment...&quot; from keeping his or her mouth shut.

==Family and death==

George Catlin met Clara Bartlett Gregory in 1828 in her hometown of Albany, New York. She was eager to escape her family home, not getting along with her father&#x27;s third wife. After a brief courtship, Clara and George married on May 11, 1828. She was 19, and Catlin was 32. After their marriage, she accompanied him on one of his journeys west. They eventually had four children. Clara and his youngest son died while visiting Paris in 1845.

Catlin died on December 23, 1872, aged 76 years in Jersey City, New Jersey.

* Luzerne County Arts &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame, inducted 2023

==In popular culture==
Catlin and his work figure repeatedly in the 2010 novel &quot;Shadow Tag&quot; by Louise Erdrich, where he is the subject of the unfinished doctoral dissertation by the character Irene America.

His 1834 painting &quot;Comanche Feats of Horsemanship&quot; was featured in the second episode of the HBO drama series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Martial Feats of Comanche Horsemanship&quot;, which was named for the painting.

<doc id="274608" wikidata="Q1143151" url="?curid=274608" title="Pro-ana">
<text>Promotion of anorexia is the promotion of behaviors related to the eating disorder anorexia nervosa. It is often referred to simply as pro-ana or ana. The lesser-used term pro-mia refers likewise to bulimia nervosa and is sometimes used interchangeably with pro-ana. Pro-ana groups differ widely in their stances. Most claim that they exist mainly as a non-judgmental environment for anorexics; a place to turn to, to discuss their illness, and to support those who choose to enter recovery. Others deny anorexia nervosa is a mental illness and claim instead that it is a lifestyle choice that should be respected by doctors and family.

Pro-ana sites often feature thinspiration (or thinspo): images or video montages of slim women, often celebrities, who may range anywhere from being naturally slim to emaciated with visibly protruding bones. The scientific community recognises anorexia nervosa as a serious illness. Some research suggests anorexia nervosa has the highest rate of mortality of any psychological disorder.

== Culture ==
Medical professionals treating eating disorders have long noted that patients in recovery programs often &quot;symptom pool&quot;, banding closely together for emotional support and validation. In this context, people with anorexia may collectively normalize their condition, defending it not as an illness but as an accomplishment of self-control and an essential part of their identity, with some members of these online communities going as far as claiming that starving oneself is a lifestyle choice rather than an illness. These &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; claims may be a symptom of anosognosia. Other community members band together for support in managing their illnesses, such as sharing harm reduction tips and having others to talk to about their experiences that are going through the same thing. Many individuals in pro-ana communities use the phrase &quot;pro for myself, not anyone else&quot; to indicate that they are only interested in furthering their own disorders, not encouraging anyone else to imitate their behavior.

=== Online presence ===
Such advocacy has flourished on the Internet, mainly through tight-knit support groups centred on web forums and social network services such as Tumblr, Xanga, LiveJournal, Facebook and Myspace. These groups are typically small, vulnerable, partly hidden and characterized by frequent migrations. They also have a high female readership and are frequently the only means of support available to socially isolated anorexics.

Members of such support groups may:
* Endorse anorexia and/or bulimia as desirable (84% and 64% respectively in a 2010 survey).
* Share crash dieting techniques and recipes (67% of sites in a 2006 survey, rising to 83% in a 2010 survey).
* Coach each other on using socially acceptable pretexts for refusing food, such as veganism (which is notably more prevalent in the eating-disordered in general).
* Compete with each other at losing weight, or fast together in displays of solidarity.
* Commiserate with one another after breaking fast or binging.
* Advise on how to best induce vomiting, and on using laxatives and emetics.
* Give tips on hiding weight loss from parents and doctors.
* Share information on reducing the side-effects of anorexia.
* Post their weight, body measurements, details of their dietary regimen or pictures of themselves to solicit acceptance and affirmation.
* Suggest ways to ignore or suppress hunger pangs.

Many have popular blogs and forums on which members seek companionship by posting about their daily lives or boasting about personal accomplishments of weight loss. The communities centred on such sites can be warmly welcoming (especially in recovery-friendly groups) or sometimes cliquish and openly suspicious of newcomers. In particular, hostility is often leveled at:
* The non-eating disordered who express disapproval, including the spouses, relatives and friends of members who appear on-site to post threats and warnings.
* Casual dieters who join, believing that inducing eating disorders will cause them to lose weight more effectively. Such people are often derisively referred to as &quot;wannabes&quot; or &quot;wannarexics&quot;.

==== Thinspiration ====

Pro-ana sites often (84%, in a 2010 survey) feature &quot;thinspiration&quot; (or &quot;thinspo&quot;): images or video montages of slim women, often celebrities, who may range anywhere from being naturally slim to emaciated with visibly protruding bones. Pro-ana bloggers, forum members and social networking groups likewise post thinspiration to motivate one another toward further weight loss. Conversely, &quot;reverse thinspiration&quot; features images of fatty food or overweight people intended to induce disgust. There exists significant controversy between supporters and opponents of thinspiration; some assert that thinspiration only &quot;glorifies&quot; eating disorders while some thinspiration bloggers argue that the purpose of thinspiration is to support a healthy level of weight loss.

Thinspirational clips circulate widely on video sharing sites, pro-ana blogs often post thinspirational entries, and many pro-ana forums have threads dedicated to sharing thinspiration. Thinspiration can also take the form of inspirational mantras, quotes or selections of lyrics from poetry or popular music (94% of sites in a 2003 survey).

Thinspiration often has a spiritual-ascetic flavour, referring to fasting through metaphors of bodily purity, food through allusions to sin and corruption, and thinness through imagery of angels and angelic flight. Exhortations like &quot;Ana&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;The Thin Commandments&quot; are also common.

=== Appeal ===
Social researchers studying pro-ana have varied explanations for its popularity, with some characterizing it as a rejection of modern consumerism and others suggesting that pro-ana functions as a coping mechanism for those already emotionally stressed by eating disorders. However, most agree on two elements of pro-ana sites:
* Initially, pro-ana sites attract both the non-eating disordered (who first visit seeking tips and techniques for losing weight) and the eating-disordered (who seek advice on hiding their disordered behaviors or minimizing the physical damage caused by over-exercising and severe calorie restriction).
* Pro-ana sites give their members a strong sense of community and common identity.

=== Fashion ===
Red bracelets are popularly worn in pro-ana, both as a discreet way for anorexics to socially identify and as a tangible reminder to avoid eating. Pro-mia bracelets, likewise, are blue or purple. Most such bracelets are simple beaded items traded briskly on online auction sites.

== Impact ==
=== Proliferation ===
Pro-ana has proliferated rapidly on the Internet, with some observers noting a first wave of pro-ana sites on free web hosting services in the late 1990s, and a second wave attributed to the recent rise of blogging and social networking services.

A survey by Internet security firm Optenet found a 470% increase in pro-ana and pro-mia sites from 2006 to 2007. A similar increase was also noted in a 2006 Maastricht University study investigating alternatives to censorship of pro-ana material. In the study, the Dutch blog host punt.nl began in October 2006 presenting visitors to pro-ana blogs on its service with a click-through warning containing a disparaging message and links to pro-recovery sites. Although the warnings were a deterrence (33.6% of the 530,000 unique visitors logged did not proceed past the warning), the number of such blogs actually increased tenfold, with their monthly traffic figures doubling on average by the end of the study.

=== Viewership ===
In a 2009 survey by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven of 711 Flemish high school students aged 13–17, 12.6% of girls and 5.9% of boys reported having visited pro-ana websites at least once. In another 2009 survey, by parental control software vendor CyberSentinel of 1500 female Internet users aged 6–15, one in three reported having searched online for dieting tips, while one in five reported having corresponded with others on social networking sites or in chat rooms for tips on dieting.

Visitors to pro-ana web sites also include a significant number of those already diagnosed with eating disorders: a 2006 survey of eating disorder patients at Stanford Medical School found that 35.5% had visited pro-ana web sites; of those, 96.0% learned new weight loss or purging methods from such sites (while 46.4% of viewers of pro-recovery sites learned new techniques).

=== Effect ===
Pro-ana sites can negatively impact the eating behavior of people with and without eating disorders. One study of individuals without eating disorders demonstrated that 84% of participants decreased caloric intake by an average of 2,470 calories (301 min -7851 max) per week after viewing pro-ED (eating disorder) websites. Only 56% of participants actually perceived the reduction in their intake. Three weeks after the experiment, 24% of participants reported continuing weight control strategies from pro-ana websites, though they did not continue to visit those sites. Controls viewing health and travel websites did not decrease caloric intake at a significant level. Other studies have found that women with varying levels of eating disorder symptomatology were more likely to engage in image comparison and exercise after viewing pro-ana websites versus control websites.

Pro-ana sites can negatively impact cognition and affect. Women who viewed a pro-ana site, but not control sites focused on fashion or home décor, experienced an increase in negative affect and decreases in self-esteem, appearance self-efficacy, and perceived attractiveness. They also reported feeling heavier and being more likely to think about their weight. The effects of perfectionism, BMI, internalization of the thin ideal, and pre-existing ED symptomatology as moderators of negative affect were comparable to chance, suggesting that pro-ana websites can affect a broad spectrum of individuals, not simply those with ED characteristics.

A 2007 survey by the University of South Florida of 1575 girls and young women found that those who had a history of viewing pro-ana websites did not differ from those who viewed only pro-recovery websites on any of the survey&#x27;s measures, including body mass index, negative body image, appearance dissatisfaction, level of disturbance, and dietary restriction. Those who had viewed pro-ana websites were, however, moderately more likely to have a negative body image than those who did not.

Similarly, girls in the 2009 Leuven survey who viewed pro-ana websites were more likely to have a negative body image and be dissatisfied with their body shape.

A 2012 report by Deloitte Access Economics, commissioned by Australian non-profit The Butterfly Foundation, estimated that eating disorders resulted in productivity losses totaling just over $AUD15 billion, with 1828 (515 males and 1313 females) dying that year from eating disorder-related complications.

=== Social support vs. exacerbation of illness ===
Unlike pro-ana sites, pro-recovery sites are designed to encourage development and maintenance of healthy behaviors and cognitions. A study of pro-ana and pro-recovery website use among adolescents with eating disorders found that adolescents used both types of websites to further eating disordered behaviors. Those who viewed pro-ana sites were comparable to those who viewed pro-recovery sites with respect to appearance dissatisfaction, restriction, and bulimic behaviors. Over half of parents were unaware of any ED website usage.

People who use pro-ana sites report lower social support than controls and seek to fill this deficit by use of pro-ana sites. While pro-ana site users in this study perceived greater support from online communities than offline relationships, they also reported being encouraged to continue eating disorder behaviors. Users of pro-ana sites (n=60) cited a sense of belonging (77%), social support (75%), and support for the choice to continue current eating disorder behaviors (54%) as reasons for joining a pro-ana site. Reasons for continuing to use a pro-ana site included general support for stress (84%), meeting others with eating disorders (50%), and finding triggers for eating disorder behaviors (37%). Finally, behaviors first learned after visiting a pro-ana site include using thinspiration (63%), hiding eating disorder behaviors (60%), fasting (57%), using diuretics and laxatives (45%), vomiting (23%), using alcohol or other drugs to inhibit appetite (22%), and self-harm (22%).

Some studies, however, claim that the link between pro-ana websites and increased incidence of eating disorders are not strongly linked; instead, these communities have just increased the visibility of those affected. It&#x27;s possible that health professionals and academics are eager to place blame on these communities because of this increased visibility and being an &quot;easy target&quot; for understanding the complex problem of root causes of eating disorders.

== Controversy and criticism ==
Many medical professionals and some anorexics view pro-ana as a glamorization of a serious illness. Pro-ana began to attract attention from the mainstream press when &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; aired a special episode in October 2001 focusing on pro-ana. Pressure from the public and pro-recovery organizations led to Yahoo and GeoCities shutting down pro-ana sites. In response, many groups now take steps to conceal themselves, disclaim their intentions as neutral and recovery-supportive (58% of sites in a 2006 survey), or interview members to screen out the non-eating disordered.

=== Medical profession ===

Health care professionals and medical associations have generally negative views of pro-ana groups and the information they disseminate:
* The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) states that Pro-Ana sites &quot;can pose a serious threat to some individuals, not simply because they promote eating disorder behaviors, but because they build a sense of community that is unhealthy. They lure the impressionable and persuade them that the Pro-Ana community is providing caring and nurturing advice.&quot;
* The Academy for Eating Disorders (AED) stated that &quot;websites that glorify anorexia as a lifestyle choice play directly to the psychology of its victims&quot;, expressing concern that sites dedicated to the promotion of anorexia as a desirable &quot;lifestyle choice&quot; &quot;provide support and encouragement to engage in health threatening behaviors, and neglect the serious consequences of starvation.&quot; However, one of its board members, Eric van Furth, has noted that pro-ana sites have relatively few visitors and advises against legal sanction of such sites, claiming instead that popular media play the more important role in establishing ideals of female thinness.
* Bodywhys (the Eating Disorders Association of Ireland) notes that pro-ana sites &quot;might initially help people to feel less isolated, but the community that they create is an unhealthy community that encourages obsessiveness and minimization of the seriousness of these potentially deadly disorders.&quot;
* B-eat (the Eating Disorders Association of the UK) has remarked that those who seek out pro-ana sites do so &quot;to find support, understanding and acceptance. We don&#x27;t call for the sites to be banned, but rather for everyone else to consider how they can also provide that understanding and acceptance so that these sites don&#x27;t become the only refuge for someone.&quot;
* The UK Royal College of Psychiatrists has called for the Council of Child Internet Safety—a UK government advisory body—to expand its definition of harmful online content to include pro-ana sites, and to inform parents and teachers of the dangers of pro-ana, arguing that &quot;the broader societal context in which pro-ana and pro-mia sites thrive is one where young women are constantly bombarded with toxic images of supposed female perfection that are impossible to achieve, make women feel bad about themselves and significantly increase their risk of eating disorders.&quot;
*The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) &quot;actively speaks out against pro-anorexia and pro-bulimia websites. These sites provide no useful information on treatment but instead encourage and falsely support those who, sadly, are ill but do not seek help.&quot; NEDA has also warned that journalists often glamorize anorexia by associating anorexia with personal self-control and that media coverage of pro-ana often triggers the already-anorexic by mentioning weights and calorie counts and by showing photographs of thin people.

=== Media ===
In October 2001, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; hosted a special on anorexia; the pro-ana movement was discussed briefly by the guest panel, who expressed alarm at the appearance of pro-ana websites and recommended the use of filtering software to bar access to them.

In July 2002, the &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot; published an investigative report into pro-ana on the web.

&quot;Growing up Online&quot;, a January 2008 episode of the PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; television program, also featured a brief discussion of pro-ana.

The 2009 novel Wintergirls features a protagonist with anorexia, who at one point in the novel seeks support from a pro-ana forum, referring to the people there as “her sisters” and “the only people that understand”.

In April 2009, &quot;The Truth about Online Anorexia&quot;, an investigative documentary about pro-ana on the Internet, aired on ITV1 in the UK presented by BBC Radio 1 DJ Fearne Cotton.

In April 2012 speech at Harvard University, &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; editor Franca Sozzani conceded that the fashion industry may be a cause of the recent rise in eating disorders, but that the industry was being unfairly singled out for blame: &quot;How can all this be possibly caused by fashion? And how come that Twiggy, who would be surely considered an anorexic today, did not arise controversy in the Sixties and did not produce a string of anorexia followers?&quot; According to Sozzani, pro-ana sites were more effective at promoting eating disorders, and obesity was the more pressing public health problem that food industry was not being likewise attacked for exacerbating.

The existence of pro-ana blogs and forums was featured in the 2014 Lifetime film &quot;Starving in Suburbia&quot;, which starred Polish actress Izabella Miko as &quot;ButterflyAna&quot;, a beautiful model and moderator on the internet who promotes anorexia religiously to the followers of her blog. This entices teenager Hannah (Laura Wiggins) to become severely anorexic; this was also the first Lifetime film to address the subject matter of anorexia among men and boys, when Hannah&#x27;s brother, Leo, is revealed to suffer from anorexia and later dies due to health complications from the disorder.

=== Arts ===
&quot;Thirty-two kilos&quot;, an exhibition by photographer Ivonne Thein, went on display at the Berlin Postfuhramt art exhibition center in May 2008 and the Washington Goethe-Institut in January 2009, featuring photographs of young women digitally manipulated to appear skeletally thin. Thein said that the photographs were intended as a mocking and satirical take on pro-ana. However, many images from the exhibition were nevertheless later shared online as thinspiration.

=== Social networking services ===
In July 2001, Yahoo—after receiving a letter of complaint from ANAD—began removing pro-ana sites from its Yahoo Clubs (now Yahoo Groups) service, stating that such sites endorsing self-harm were violations of its terms of service agreement.

LiveJournal has not made a position statement on pro-ana. In August 2007, however, a staff member declined to act on an abuse report filed against a pro-ana community hosted on its network, stating that: 

Facebook staff seek out and regularly delete pro-ana related groups. A spokesperson for the online service has stated that such pages violate the site&#x27;s terms of service agreement by promoting self-harm in others.

MySpace does not ban pro-ana material and has stated that 
MySpace has chosen instead to cycle banner advertisements for pro-recovery organizations through pro-ana members&#x27; profiles.

In November 2007, Microsoft shut down four pro-ana sites on the Spanish-language version of its Spaces social networking service at the behest of IQUA, the Internet regulatory body for Catalonia. A Microsoft spokesperson stated that such sites &quot;infringe all the rules on content created by users and visible on our sites&quot;.

In September 2008, San Sebastián-based Spanish-language web portal removed its pro-ana forums at the request of the provincial prosecutor for Guipúzcoa and the , who stated that &quot;while not illegal, the harmful and false information in such forums being disseminated to minors will impair their proper development.&quot;

In February 2012, after consulting with NEDA, the blog-hosting service Tumblr announced that it would shut down blogs hosted on its microblogging service which &quot;actively promote or glorify self harm,&quot; including eating disorders, and display warnings with names of organizations that can help facilitate recovery in people affected by eating disorders, on searches for common pro-eating disorder terms. Despite this, Tumblr remains a large hub for pro-ana microblogging. Pinterest, a social photo-sharing site, similarly amended its TOS in March 2012 to ban pro-ana content, but was similarly unsuccessful. Instagram followed suit and announced in April 2012 that it would summarily disable any accounts on its photo-sharing service with pro-ana specific hashtags on images.

TikTok&#x27;s algorithm has been criticized for amplifying pro-ana content.

=== Politics ===
In the United Kingdom, 40 MPs signed an early day motion tabled in February 2008 by the then Liberal Democrats member for Cheadle, Mark Hunter, urging government action against pro-ana sites. The motion was timed to coincide with the UK National Eating Disorder Awareness Week.

In the United Kingdom, Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat member for East Dunbartonshire, called for advertisers to voluntarily adopt similar disclaimers in an adjournment debate in October 2009, and later in an early day motion tabled in February 2010. She has stated that such &quot;photos can lead people to believe in realities that, very often, do not exist,&quot; and that &quot;when teenagers and women look at these pictures in magazines, they end up feeling unhappy with themselves.&quot;

In April 2008, a bill outlawing material which &quot;provokes a person to seek excessive thinness by encouraging prolonged restriction of nourishment&quot; was tabled in the French National Assembly by UMP MP Valérie Boyer. It imposes a fine of €30,000 and two years imprisonment (rising to €45,000 and three years if there was a resulting death) on offenders. Health minister Roselyne Bachelot, arguing for the bill, stated that &quot;giving young girls advice about how to lie to their doctors, telling them what kinds of food are easiest to vomit, encouraging them to torture themselves whenever they take any kind of food is not part of liberty of expression.&quot; The bill passed the National Assembly, but stalled in the Senate, where a June 2008 report by the Committee of Social Affairs emphatically recommended against such legislation and instead suggested early-screening programs by schools and physicians.

Boyer subsequently introduced another bill in September 2009 to mandate disclaimers on photographs in which body parts have been retouched, with the aim of reducing the impact of unrealism in photography on young girls and women. The bill was ostensibly targeted at advertising photography but could be broadly applicable to digitally manipulated photography in general, including thinspirational montages. It imposes a penalty of €37,500 per violation, with a possible rise to 50% of the cost of each advertisement. The bill did not pass its first reading and was relegated to the Committee of Social Affairs.

In April 2009, Dutch Minister for Youth and Family André Rouvoet called for click-through warnings to be added to all pro-ana sites on Dutch hosting services, citing a successful trial of such warnings by blog host punt.nl in 2006. The Dutch Hosting Provider Association, however, has stated that &quot;the Internet is simply a reflection of a world with many undesirable things&quot;, and that its members cannot be held responsible for monitoring and disclaiming all hosted content.

In March 2012, the Israeli Knesset passed a bill sponsored by Kadima MK Rachel Adato and Likud MK Danny Danon requiring advertisements which have been retouched to alter the body shape of models to fully disclose the fact. The bill, which applies to both foreign-produced and locally produced advertising, also sets a lower BMI limit for models featured in advertisements of 18.5 (the threshold of underweight under World Health Organization guidelines).

=== Popular culture ===
In a November 2009 interview with &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, model Kate Moss gave a popular thinspirational slogan as her motto: &quot;Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.&quot; Moss came under widespread criticism—particularly by eating disorder recovery organizations—for endorsing pro-ana. Her agency, Storm, stated: &quot;This was part of a longer answer Kate gave during a wider ranging interview which has unfortunately been taken out of context and misrepresented.&quot; Still, Moss has been known in the fashion world to have helped popularize the &quot;heroin chic&quot; trend, which uses models with disheveled, ultra-skinny, and waif-like body types on the runway.

<text>Cyril the Swan is a fictional giant swan, the official mascot of Swansea City A.F.C. since 1998. 

Cyril was voted Best Mascot by readers of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; magazine. His antics have got him into trouble with the police on several occasions (mainly for fighting with other mascots and stewards), and he has been accused of bringing the game into disrepute.

Highlights of his troublesome antics include removing the head of Millwall mascot Zampa the Lion, and drop-kicking it along the ground. On a Dutch TV documentary, when asked what he said to Zampa he replied &quot;Don&#x27;t fuck with the Swans&quot;. The Swan was fined £1000 for the incident. 

Cyril appeared as the pet of the Emperor of China, in a British pantomime of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. As a mute swan, he does not give interviews.

Adrian Nielsen of Clubmascots created Cybil the Swan who married Cyril at the Vetch field on 2 April 2005, which led to Clubmascots producing a range of soft toys and merchandise in time for the move from the Vetch to the new Liberty Stadium; since then a full range of sports merchandise has been available for sale through the Swans shop.

<text>Mountain Province (; ; ; ; ; ) is a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. Its capital is Bontoc while Bauko is the largest municipality. Mountain Province was formerly referred to as Mountain in some foreign references. The name is usually shortened by locals to Mt. Province. 

The province was named so for being in the Cordillera Central mountain range found in the upper realms of Luzon island.

Mountain Province was also the name of the historical province that included most of the current Cordillera provinces. This old province was established by the Philippine Commission in 1908, and was later split in 1966 into Mountain Province, Benguet, Kalinga-Apayao and Ifugao.

The province is also known for its mummy caves, which contain naturally mummified bodies, and for its hanging coffins.

==History==

===Spanish colonial era===
The area of the Cordillera mountains proved difficult to control by the Spaniards. During the long Spanish rule, not much was done to bring the province under control. From 1566 to 1665, they sent expeditions to conquer the land but the rugged terrain and hostile indigenous population at the time were major obstacles to complete subjugation. The first serious effort to subjugate them was made in 1785 when soldiers were sent from Cagayan to put down a revolt of the Kalingas. A famous Spanish explorer, Guillermo Galvez, conducted more than 40 forays to the mountainous region.

Formerly called &quot;La Montañosa&quot; by the Spanish colonizers due to its mountainous terrain, the area was subdivided into 6 &quot;comandancias politico-militar&quot;.

===American colonial era===

On August 19, 1908, during the American rule, the Philippine Commission enacted &quot;Act No. 1876&quot;, which organized the entire area of the Cordilleras into one large province, named &quot;Mountain Province&quot;.

The first governor was Samuel Kane, and the town of Bontoc was made the capital. It was originally composed of the sub-provinces of Amburayan, Apayao, Benguet, Lepanto-Bontoc, Ifugao and Kalinga.
Amburayan was later abolished in 1920 and its corresponding territories were transferred to the provinces of Ilocos Sur and La Union. Lepanto was also reduced in size and its towns were integrated into the sub-provinces of Bontoc and Benguet, and to the province of Ilocos Sur.


===Philippine independence===
Effective on April 7, 1967, &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot; abolished the old Mountain Province, converting its sub-provinces into 4 independent provinces: Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga-Apayao and Mountain Province (corresponding to the former &quot;Bontoc&quot; sub-province). Bontoc became the capital of the new Mountain Province.

Mountain Province would have been significantly affected by the Chico River Dam Project during the Marcos administration, as the Marcos regime&#x27;s project would have flooded the municipalities of Sabangan, Sagada, Sadanga, Bontoc, Bauko, and parts of Barlig. However, the indigenous peoples of Kalinga Province and Mountain Province resisted the project and when hostilities resulted in the murder of Macli-ing Dulag, the project became unpopular and was abandoned before Marcos was ousted by the 1986 People Power Revolution.

On June 15, 1987, the Cordillera Administrative Region was established upon the issuance of &quot;Executive Order 220&quot; by then-President Corazon Aquino, and Mountain Province was made one of its provinces.

<text>Services marketing is a specialized branch of marketing which emerged as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, following the recognition that the unique characteristics of services required different strategies compared with the marketing of physical goods.

Services marketing typically refers to both business to consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) services, and includes the marketing of services such as telecommunications services, financial services, all types of hospitality, tourism leisure and entertainment services, car rental services, health care services, professional services and trade services. Service marketers often use an expanded marketing mix which consists of the seven Ps: product, price, place, promotion, people, physical evidence and process. A contemporary approach, known as &quot;service-dominant logic&quot;, argues that the demarcation between products and services that persisted throughout the 20th century was artificial and has obscured the fact that everyone sells service. The S-D logic approach is changing the way that marketers understand &quot;value-creation&quot; and is changing concepts of the consumer&#x27;s role in service delivery processes.

==Services Marketing: definitions==

The American Marketing Association defines service marketing as an organizational function and a set of processes for identifying or creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in a way that benefit the organization and stake-holders. Services are (usually) intangible economic activities offered by one party to another. Often time-based, services performed bring about desired results to recipients, objects, or other assets for which purchasers have responsibility. In exchange for money, time, and effort, service customers expect value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities , networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.

: A service encounter can be defined as the duration in which a customer interacts with a service. The customer&#x27;s interactions with a service provider typically involve face-to-face contact with service personnel, in addition to interactions with the physical elements of the service environment including the facilities and equipment.

==Concepts of service==

Scholars have long debated the nature of services. Some of the earliest attempts to define services focused on what makes them different from goods. Late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century definitions highlighted the nature of ownership and wealth creation. Classical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership implied possession of a tangible object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner. In contrast, when services were purchased, no title to goods changed hands.

===Historical perspectives===

Adam Smith&#x27;s seminal work, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776), distinguished between the outputs of what he termed &quot;productive&quot; and &quot;unproductive&quot; labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value. But unproductive labor, however &quot;honourable, ...useful, or... necessary&quot; created services that perished at the time of production and therefore didn&#x27;t contribute to wealth.

French economist Jean-Baptiste Say argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term &quot;immaterial products&quot; to describe them. In the 1920s, Alfred Marshall was still using the idea that services &quot;are immaterial products.&quot;

In the mid nineteenth century John Stuart Mill wrote that services are &quot;utilities not fixed or embodied in any object, but consisting of a mere service rendered ...without leaving a permanent acquisition.&quot;

===Contemporary perspectives===

When services marketing emerged as a separate sub-branch within the marketing discipline in the early 1980s, it was largely a protest against the dominance of prevailing product-centric view. In 1960, the US economy changed forever. In that year, for the first time in a major trading nation, more people were employed in the service sector than in manufacturing industries. Other developed nations soon followed by shifting to a service based economy. Scholars soon began to recognise that services were important in their own right, rather than as some residual category left over after goods were taken into account. This recognition triggered a change in the way services were defined. By the mid twentieth century, scholars began defining services in terms of their own unique characteristics, rather than by comparison with products. The following set of definitions shows how scholars were grappling with the distinctive aspects of service products and developing new definitions of service.

* &quot;Goods are produced: services are performed.&quot; (Rathmell, 1966) 
* &quot;A service is an activity or a series of activities which take place in interactions with a contact person or a physical machine and which provides consumer satisfaction.&quot; (Lehtinen, 1983 
* &quot;The heart of the service product is the experience of the consumer which takes place in real time... it is the interactive process itself that creates the benefits desired by the consumer.&quot; (Bateson, 1992) 
* &quot;Services are deeds, processes and performances.&quot; (Zeithmal and Bitner, 1996) 
* &quot;Services are processes (economic activities) that provide time, place, form, problem-solving or experiential value to the recipient.&quot; (Lovelock, 2007) 
* &quot;The term &#x27;service&#x27;... is synonymous with value. A supplier has a value proposition, but value actualization takes place during the customer&#x27;s usage and consumption process.&quot; (Gummesson, 2008) 

===Alternative view===
A recently proposed alternative view is that services involve a form of rental through which customers can obtain benefits. Customers are willing to pay for aspirational experiences and solutions that add value to their lifestyle. The term, rent, can be used as a general term to describe payment made for use of something or access to skills and expertise, facilities or networks (usually for a defined period of time), instead of buying it outright (which is not even possible in many instances).

There are five broad categories within the non-ownership framework
# Rented goods services: These services enable customers to obtain the temporary right to use a physical good that they prefer not to own (e.g. boats, costumes)
# Defined space and place rentals: These services obtain use of a defined portion of a larger space in a building, vehicle or other area which can be an end in its own right (e.g. storage container in a warehouse) or simply a means to an end (e.g. table in a restaurant, seat in an aircraft)
# Labor and expertise rental: People are hired to perform work that customers either choose not to do for themselves (e.g. cleaning the house) or are unable to do due to the lack of expertise, tools and skills (e.g. car repairs, surgery)
# Access to shared physical environments: These environments can be indoors or outdoors where customers rent the right to share the use of the environment (e.g. museums, theme parks, gyms, golf courses).
# Access to and usage of systems and networks: Customers rent the right to participate in a specified network such as telecommunications, utilities, banking or insurance, with different fees for varying levels of access

==Services: Unique characteristics==

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the so-called unique characteristics of services dominated much of the literature.

The four most commonly cited characteristics of services are:
:&quot;Intangibility&quot; – services lack physical form; they do not interact with any of our senses in a conventional way, they cannot be touched or held. 
: Implications of intangibility: Ownership cannot be transferred, value derives from consumption or experience, quality is difficult to evaluate prior to consumption or purchase.
:&quot;Inseparability&quot; – production and consumption cannot be separated (compared with goods where production and consumption are entirely discrete processes)
: Implications of inseparability: Services are typically high contact systems and are labour-intensive; fewer opportunities to transact business at arm&#x27;s length, fewer opportunities to substitute capital for labour; subject to human error.

:&quot;Perishability&quot; – service performances are ephemeral; unlike physical goods, services cannot be stored or inventoried.
: Implications of perishability: Demand is subject to wide fluctuations, no inventory to serve as a buffer between supply and demand; unused capacity cannot be reserved; high opportunity cost of idle capacity.

:&quot;Variability&quot; (also known as heterogeneity) – services involve processes delivered by service personnel and subject to human variation, customers often seek highly customized solutions, services are inherently variable in quality and substance.
: Implications of variability: Service quality is difficult to manage; fewer opportunities to standardize service delivery.

The unique characteristics of services give rise to problems and challenges that are rarely paralleled in product marketing. Services are complex, multi-dimensional and multi-layered. Not only are there multiple benefits, but there are also a multiplicity of interactions between customers and organizations as well as between customers and other customers.

==Framework==

===Classification of goods and services===

There are many ways to classify services. One classification considers who or what is being processed and identifies four classes of services: people processing (e.g. beauty services, child care, medical services); mental stimulus processing (e.g. education services, counselling services, life-coaching), possession processing (e.g. pet care, appliance repair, piano tuning) and information processing (e.g. financial services, data warehousing services). Another method used to classify services uses the degree of customer interaction in the service process and classifies services as &quot;high contact&quot; (e.g. hospitality, dental care, hairdressing) or &quot;low contact&quot; (e.g. telecommunications, utility services).

Both economists and marketers make extensive use of the Search → Experience → Credence (SEC) classification of goods and services. The classification scheme is based on the ease or difficulty of consumer evaluation activities and identifies three broad classes of goods.

: &quot;Search goods&quot;: are those which possess attributes that can evaluated prior to purchase or consumption. Consumers rely on prior experience, direct product inspection and other information search activities to locate information that assists in the evaluation process. Most products fall into the search goods category (e.g. clothing, office stationery, home furnishings).

: &quot;Experience goods&quot;: are goods or services that can be accurately evaluated only after the product has been purchased and experiences. Many personal services fall into this category (e.g. restaurant, hairdresser, beauty salon, theme park, travel, holiday).

: &quot;Credence claims&quot;: are goods or services that are difficult or impossible to evaluate even after consumption has occurred. Evaluation difficulties may arise because the consumer lacks the requisite knowledge or technical expertise to make a realistic evaluation or, alternatively because the cost of information-acquisition is prohibitive or outweighs the value of the information available. Many professional services fall into this category (e.g. accountant, legal services, medical diagnosis/treatment, cosmetic surgery). These goods are called credence products because the consumer&#x27;s quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.

While some services may possess a number of search attributes (tangible dimensions), most services are high in experience or credence properties. Empirical studies have shown that consumers&#x27; perceived risk increases along the search-experience-credence continuum. The implication is that services tend to be high involvement decisions – where the consumer invests more heavily in information search activities during the purchase decision.

=== Risk perception and risk reduction in service purchase decisions ===


Perceived risk is associated with all purchasing decisions, both products and services alike. In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists argue that perceived purchase risk is higher for experience goods and credence goods with implications for consumer evaluation processes. Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer&#x27;s decision process, consumers of services are more likely to engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk. Any activity that a consumer undertakes in an effort to reduce perceived risk is known as a &quot;risk reduction activity&quot;.

Risk perception has been defined as &quot;a perception or feeling &quot;based on consumer&#x27;s judgments of the likelihood of negative outcomes (uncertainty) and the degree of importance of these outcomes to the individual [consequences]&quot;. Thus, pre-purchase risk is a function of two dimensions, namely:

: &quot;Uncertainty&quot;: the consumer&#x27;s subjective assessment of the likelihood of occurrence 
: &quot;Consequence&quot;: the severity of the outcome for the individual in the event that a poor purchase decision is made

For example, consider the case of a prospective air traveler. Most of us know that the probability of being involved in an airline disaster is low (low uncertainty). It is conventional wisdom that travelers are safer in the air than on the roads. Statistically, you are much more likely to be involved in a vehicular accident than an aircraft disaster. While the likelihood of personal harm arising from air travel is indeed very low, the consequences of an airline disaster however are very serious indeed (high consequence). Whereas, car travelers who have been involved in a traffic accident often walk away with minor injuries, the same cannot be said for airline travelers. It is the severity of the consequence rather than the uncertainty that plays into airline passengers&#x27; fears. Consumers are constantly weighing up uncertainty and consequences to reach subjective evaluations of the overall risk attached to various purchase decisions.

Risk perception drives the information search process. Heightened risk perception may become a barrier to the natural progression of the purchase decision process and prevent customers from making a final brand choice. Consumers who are risk-averse tend to spend more time and effort engaged in information acquisition in the pre-purchase stage and look for specific types of information that will alleviate their perceptions of risk. Typical &quot;risk relievers&quot; might include such things as a reliance on personal sources of recommendation including word-of-mouth referrals; reliance on known and trusted brands, reading manufacturers&#x27; specifications, limited scale trial, reliance on warranties or guarantees etc.

Risk relievers that are especially relevant in service settings include:

:&quot;High price maintenance:&quot; Some evidence suggests that risk-averse consumers often use high price as a guide to quality. Low prices may therefore be counter-productive since they suggest lower quality. Prestige pricing or premium pricing strategies are more likely to be indicated in service settings.

: &quot;Limited scale trial:&quot; While some services cannot be fully trialled, marketers should think about limited scale trial or a virtual trial. e.g. use computer-aided design to visualize hairstyles, plastic surgery, Many virtual brand sites found online have successfully built of the notion of limited trial. Other examples include: test driving a software application.

:&quot;Standardize the Product and Delivery:&quot; This is sometimes known as the McDonald&#x27;s approach. Since variations in quality contribute to higher levels of perceived risk, one technique is to minimize variations by using production line techniques to control standards. This approach may be limited because many customers expect high levels of flexibility and customization as part of the process. Standardization needs to be fully communicated to customers – existing and potential – to be fully effective.

: &quot;Purchase from a known or trusted brand&quot;: Consumers of services may be more predisposed to use a known, reputable brand as an indicator of quality merchandise. For this reason, service providers are presented with greater opportunities to engage in relationship marketing

===Matching supply and demand===

Service operations are often characterized by far more uncertainty with respect to the flow of demand. Service firms are often said to be &quot;capacity constrained&quot;. This refers to the finite carrying capacity for most service operators and the lack of inventory which serves as a buffer against unexpected or peak demand.

There are two components to capacity (i.e., supply) in service operations:
:&quot;Number of employees&quot;: In medium and high contact systems, capacity is constrained by the number of contact staff available to provide service.

:&quot;Size of service environment&quot;: Service environments have fixed space. A restaurant has a given number of tables, a hotel has a limited number of rooms, buses and trains are licensed to carry a specified number of passengers.

The factors contributing to uneven demand are more complex and difficult to predict. The components of demand may be seen as comprising long term demand patterns (trends), short term seasonal fluctuations and irregular effects.

:&quot;Long-term demand patterns:&quot; Most industries exhibit underlying trends in demand over longer time frames. A trend is the long term direction in a time-series. Are sales growing, declining or stable? Often the trend in sales is related to the stage of the product life cycle. For example, industries in growth stages exhibit rapid increases in sales while industries in maturity may find that sales figures reach a plateau. Long-term demand patterns are stable and relatively easy to predict.

:&quot;Seasonal Factors:&quot; Seasonal components are systematic, calendar-related movements in sales. Seasonal factors are recurring and relatively easy to predict. Seasonal factors might include peak and off peak seasons for a tourist resort. For a restaurant, however, peak seasons might coincide with main meal periods on a daily basis. Other seasonal factors include trading day trading day effects and holiday periods.

: &quot;Irregular Fluctuations:&quot; Irregular fluctuations are unsystematic, short term fluctuations. Irregular effects are highly unpredictable. e.g. inclement weather closes an airport, forcing local hotels to accommodate thousands of guests with minimal advance warning; an unexpected thunder storm leads to a surge in demand for umbrellas.

When demand is low, capacity may be under-utilized while excess demand places enormous pressures on the service system. Service managers need to develop strategies for managing demand and supply under different conditions. Strategies for managing capacity involve careful consideration of both demand-side considerations and supply-side considerations.

On the capacity side:

:&quot;Add to capacity&quot; – hire additional staff (e.g. casuals or temporary staff for peak periods); add to space (e.g. extra floor space in retail, hospitality or increased fleet size in transport services) Increasing capacity may require service re-design and presents a longer term solution to capacity problems.
:&quot;Reconfigure interior space&quot; – with careful reconfiguration of interiors, it may be possible to accommodate a larger number of customers e.g. airline s to add to number of seats by reducing leg room.
:&quot;Use Customers to Boost Productivity&quot; – Customers labour can be harnessed to reduce pressures on the system e.g. self-service, e-ticketing.
:&quot;Transact business at arm&#x27;s length&quot; – Use the internet or virtual delivery systems to transact business. 
:&quot; Ask Customers to use Third Parties&quot; – Where possible, have customers use agents or brokers to minimize the number of individual contacts and reduce pressure on the service system.
:&quot; Share capacity&quot; – it may be possible to share capacity with other businesses e.g. airlines build strategic alliances with other operators so that excess demand can be booked or referred to a known ally (and does not involve passengers losing frequent flyer points).

On the demand side:

:&quot;Locate and target market segments with different demand patterns&quot; – e.g. a ski resort could develop fishing and sight-seeing packages for bushwalkers and anglers to build demand during traditional off peak seasons.
:&quot;Develop innovative products for off peak periods&quot; – e.g. an airline could develop mystery flights, fly over Antarctica specials, singles flights, blues or jazz flights, gourmet flights, fight sensitivity training flights for nervous travelers, Winter wonderland specials, etc. (a medium term strategy).
:&quot;Use efficiency based pricing methods&quot; – price incentives, such as time-based differential pricing (peak and off peak); market-based differential pricing (e.g. economy and business class); price-volume discounts, use pricing to encourage pre-booking which facilitates superior forecasting e.g. Car hire company, Uber, uses &quot;surge pricing&quot; during periods of high demand.
:&quot;Use reservations systems to manage demand&quot; – &quot;yield management&quot; or &quot;dynamic pricing&quot; which uses a combination of segment-by-segment demand forecasting alongside subtle price adjustments (requires sophisticated software programs to analyze demand) e.g. hotels and airlines utilize yield management to set prices based on demand patterns.
:&quot;Use stand-by systems&quot; – allow customers the option of taking up last minute vacancies or &quot;no-show&quot; places.
:&quot;Shape demand&quot;- management may attempt to shape demand patterns through customer education programs or lobbying e.g. encourage engaged couples to hold wedding ceremonies on days other than Saturday spread demand more evenly across the days of the week, lobby different state authorities to stagger scheduled school holiday periods in order to spread demand for holiday services more evenly across the year.

When demand exceeds capacity, then reductions in service quality are a probable outcome. Over-crowding and lengthy waiting lines potentially erode the customer experience and place stresses on employees and the service system. Employees may compensate by minimizing the time spent with each customer in an effort to serve more people, but such responses have the potential to introduce human error into service delivery. When capacity far exceeds supply, then capacity becomes idle. Spare capacity is unproductive and an inefficient use of resources. A short-term solution to spare capacity is to seek reductions in operating costs. For instance, management might ask staff to take leave, reduce number of check in counters open, limit number lifts operating and close off entire floors of a building to reduce operating costs during off peak periods as a means of achieving cost savings. In addition, routine maintenance tasks or planned refurbishment activities, which involve downtime, should be carried out during off peak periods to minimize disruption to patrons.

====Managing waiting lines====

When demand exceeds capacity, customers may have to wait for services. Lovelock identifies a range of different types of waiting lines or queuing systems:
: &quot;Single Line/ Single Server Queues&quot;: Single line queues are among the most common. Examples can be found in cafes and sandwich bars around town. At Disneyland, for example, single line queues are employed despite the large numbers of visitors. However, Disney provides roving entertainers to visit waiting lines as a form of distraction.

: &quot;Parallel Lines/ Multiple Servers&quot;: Parallel lines are useful when there is more than one service station. However a major drawback is lines often move at different speeds. When patrons perceive that their line is moving more slowly, it can give rise to a sense of inequity. A variation of this type of queue is to devote some stations to different classes of customer. This variation is used in supermarkets where an express lane can be set up for customers with a small basket of items. It is also used at airport check-in counters where different lines form for economy class passengers and business class passengers.

: &quot;Snake Queue&quot;: The snake queue employs a physical race to guide customers through to the service station. Its main advantage is that all customers will be served on a first-in, first served basis, which for many people is the fairest system.

: &quot;Take a Number&quot;: In the take a number system customers do not need to form orderly queues once they have been assigned a number. Instead, customers can relax, enjoy the service firm&#x27;s facilities until their number is called.

: &quot;Other queue systems&quot;: Of course, other types of system can be found in service environments. Hospital emergency department, for example, use &quot;Triage&quot; in which patients are assessed by a triage nurse who ranks the severity of their condition and assigns them to a doctor based on need.

==Program==

The argument that services require different marketing strategies is based on the insight that services are fundamentally different to goods and that services marketing requires different models to understand the marketing of services to customers. The &quot;marketing mix&quot; (also known as the &quot;four Ps&quot;) is a foundation concept in marketing and has defined the so-called managerial approach since the 1960s. The marketing mix or marketing program is understood to refer to the &quot;set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market&quot;. The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: &quot;product&quot;, &quot;price&quot;, &quot;promotion&quot;, and &quot;place&quot;.

===Expanded and modified marketing mix===

The prospect of expanding and modifying the marketing mix for services first took hold at the inaugural AMA Conference dedicated to Services Marketing in 1981, and built on earlier theoretical works pointing to many important limitations of the 4 Ps concept. Taken collectively, the papers presented at that conference indicate that service marketers were thinking about a revision to the general marketing mix based on an understanding that services were fundamentally different to products, and therefore required different tools and strategies. At the Services Marketing Conference in 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of seven Ps, comprising the original four Ps plus &quot;process, people&quot; and &quot;physical evidence&quot;, as being more applicable for services marketing. Since then there have been a number of different proposals for a service marketing mix (with various numbers of Ps – 6 Ps, 7 Ps, 8 Ps, 9 Ps and occasionally more). The model of 7 Ps has gained widespread acceptance, to the extent that some theorists have argued for the 7 Ps framework proposed by Booms and Bitner to be applied to products as a replacement for the four Ps.

The extended marketing mix for services is more than the simple addition of three extra Ps. Rather it also modifies the traditional mix of product, price, place and promotion for superior application to services.

==== Product====

Service products are conceptualized as consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible elements:

: &quot;Core service:&quot; the basic reason for the business; that which solves consumer problems

: &quot;Supplementary goods and services:&quot; supplements or adds value to the core product and helps differentiate the service from competitors (e.g. consultation, safe-keeping, hospitality, exceptions)

: &quot;Facilitating services&quot;: (sometimes called &quot;delivery services&quot;): Facilitate the delivery and consumption of the core service (are essential to delivery) (e.g. information provision, order-taking, billing, payment methods)

: &quot;Supporting services&quot;: support the core and could be eliminated without destabilizing the core.

The distinction between supplementary and facilitating services varies, depending on the nature of the service. For instance, the provision of coffee and tea would be considered a supporting service in a bank, but would be a facilitating service in a bed and breakfast facility. Whether an element is classified as facilitating or supporting depends on the context.

==== Price====

Service marketers need to consider a range of other issues in price setting and management of prices:

* Price Charged: the traditional pricing decision. 
* Timing of Payment: Given that customers are part of the service process and that some customers remain in the process for days, months or even years (e.g. guest house, hotel stay, university tuition), decisions must be made about whether to request payment at time when the service encounter is initiated, during the encounter or on termination of an encounter. Deposits, installments and exit fees are all options that can be considered.
* Mode of Payment: Given that customers enter into long term relationships with service providers, it is possible that some patrons will expect to be able to pay on account. Payment options include: EFTPOS, direct transfer, cash/ credit cheque, invoice.

Many service firms operate in industries where price is restricted by professional codes of conduct or by government influences which may have implications for pricing. It is possible to identify three broad scenarios:
* Services subject to public regulation (e.g. healthcare, public transport)
* Services subject to formal self-regulation (e.g. universities, schools)
* Services Subject to regulation of marketplace (e.g. hospitality, tourism, leisure services)
In situations where the service is subject to some type of public regulation, government departments may establish ceiling prices which effectively limit the amount that can be charged.

The concept of a &quot;social price&quot; may be more important for service marketers. A social price refers to &quot;non financial aspects of price&quot;. Fine identifies four types of social price: Time, Effort, Lifestyle and Psyche. In effect, this means that consumers may be more acutely aware of the opportunity costs associated with the consumption of a service. In practice, this may mean that consumers of services experience a heightened sense of &quot;temporal risk&quot;.

The most widely used pricing tactics in services marketing are:

* High or low differential pricing
* Flexible pricing
* Diversionary pricing
* Offset pricing
* Guaranteed pricing
* Loss leader pricing
* Discounted pricing

==== Place====
In making place decisions, there are several related questions which must be asked. What is the purpose of the distribution program? Who are the customers? Who should the intermediaries be?

* Purpose of Distribution: Mass distribution; selective distribution or exclusive distribution
* Number of levels in distribution channel: Direct distribution vs multi-marketing and location decisions 
* Intermediaries: Agents versus Resellers; Brokers and other parties; Surrogate Consumers 

==== Promotion====

===The expanded marketing mix===

Contemporary service marketing texts tend to be organized around a framework of &quot;seven Ps&quot; or &quot;eight Ps&quot;. The 7 Ps comprises the original 4 Ps plus &quot;process&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, &quot;physical environment&quot;. The &quot;eight Ps&quot; framework; comprises the 7 Ps plus &quot;performance&quot; which refers to the standards of service performance or service quality.

====Physical evidence====

Given the intangible nature of services, consumers often rely on the physical evidence to evaluate service quality. Therefore, service marketers must manage the physical evidence – which includes any element of the service environment which impacts on one or more of the customers five senses – the sense of smell, taste, hearing, sight and touch. Theorists identify two types of physical evidence, namely;

:&quot;Peripheral evidence:&quot; is actually possessed as part of the purchase of a service but has no independent value unless backed by the service. e.g. a cheque book, credit card, admission ticket, hotel stationery.
: &quot;Essential evidence:&quot; unlike peripheral evidence cannot be possessed by the client. It contributes to ambience or image e.g. building and furnishings, layout, equipment, people, etc.

A number of different theoretical traditions can be used to inform the study of service environments including stimulus-organism-response (SOR) models; environmental psychology; semiotics and Servicescapes.

=====Stimulus-response models=====
The SOR model (stimulus→organism→response model) describes the way that organisms, which includes both customers and employees, respond to environmental stimuli. In a service setting the environmental stimuli might include lighting, ambient temperature, background music, layout and interior-design. In essence, the model proposes that people&#x27;s responses exhibit both emotional and behavioural responses to stimuli in the external environment.

===== Environmental psychology=====

Environmental psychologists investigate the impact of spatial environments on behaviour. Emotional responses to environmental stimuli fall into three dimensions; pleasure, arousal and dominance. The individual&#x27;s emotional state is thought to mediate the behavioural response, namely approach or avoidance behaviour towards the environment. Architects and designers can use insights from environmental psychology to design environments that promote desired emotional or behavioural outcomes.

Three emotional responses are suggested in the model. These responses should be understood as a continuum, rather than a discrete emotion, and customers can be visualized as falling anywhere along the continuum.

:&quot;Pleasure–displeasure&quot; refers to the emotional state reflecting the degree to which consumers and employees are satisfied with the service experience.

:&quot;Arousal–non-arousal&quot; refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel excited and stimulated.

:&quot;Dominance–submissiveness&quot; refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel in control and able to act freely within the service environment.

The individual&#x27;s emotional response mediate the individual&#x27;s behavioural response of &quot;Approach→ Avoidance&quot;. Approach refers to the act of physically moving towards something while avoidance interferes with people&#x27;s ability to interact. In a service environment, approach behaviours might be characterized by a desire to explore an unfamiliar environment, remain in the service environment, interact with the environment and with other persons in the environment and a willingness to perform tasks within that environment. Avoid behaviours are characterized by a desire to leave the establishment, ignore the service environment, and feelings disappointment with the service experience. Environments in which people feel they lack control are unattractive. Customers often understand the concept of approach intuitively when they comment that a particular place &quot;looks inviting&quot;. The desired level of emotional arousal depends on the situation. For example, at a gym arousal might be more important than pleasure (No Pain; No gain). In a leisure setting, pleasure might be more important. If the environment pleases, then the customer will be induced to stay longer and explore all that the service has to offer. Too much arousal can be counter-productive. For instance, a romantic couple might feel out of place in a busy, noisy and cluttered restaurant. Obviously, some level of arousal is necessary as a motivation to buy. The longer a customer stays in an environment, the greater the opportunities to cross-sell a range of service offerings.

Mehrabian and Russell identified two types of environment based on the degree of information processing and stimulation:

: &quot;High load&quot;: Environments that are unfamiliar, novel, complex, unpredictable or crowded are high load

: &quot;Low load&quot;: Environments that are familiar, simple, unsurprising and well organized are low load.

Activities or tasks that are low load require a more stimulating environment for optimum performance. If the task to be performed in relatively simple, routine or boring then users benefit from a slightly more stimulating environment. On the other hand, tasks that are complex or difficult may benefit from a low load environment. In a service environment, a high load environment encourages patrons to enter and explore the various service offerings and spaces.

===== Servicescapes=====


The servicescapes model was developed by Mary Jo Bitner and published in 1992. It is an applied model, specifically developed to inform the analysis of service environments, and was influenced by both stimulus-response theory and environmental psychology.

======Physical environment dimensions======

As the diagram of the servicescapes model illustrates, the service environment consists of physical environment dimensions which act as stimuli. Environmental simulis are normally considered as three broad categories including:

: &quot;Ambient Conditions&quot;: Temperature, air quality, ambient noise, lighting, background music, odor, etc.

: &quot;Space/ Function&quot;: Equipment such as cash registers, layout, furnishings and furniture, etc.

: &quot;Signs, symbols &amp; Artefacts&quot;: Directional signage, personal artefacts (e.g. souvenirs, mementos), corporate livery and logos, style of décor (including colour schemes), symbols etc

Each element in the physical environment serves specific roles -and some may perform multiple roles. Signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service environment. For instance, furnishings may serve a functional role in that they provide seating, but the construction materials, such as fabric, tapestry and velvet may serve a symbolic role. Plush fabrics and generous drapery may suggest an elegant, up-market venue, while plastic chairs may signify an inexpensive, family-friendly venue. When evaluating the servicescape, the combined effect of all the elements must also be taken into consideration.

======The holistic environment ======
When consumers enter a servicescape, they scan the ambient conditions, layout, furnishings and artefacts and aggregate them to derive an overall &quot;impression&quot; of the environment. In other words, the &quot;holistic environment&quot; represents the cumulative effect of multiple stimuli, most of which are processed within a split second. These types of global judgments represent the summation of processing multiple stimuli to form a single, overall impression in the consumer&#x27;s mind.

Through careful design of the physical environment and ambient conditions, managers are able to communicate the service firm&#x27;s values and positioning. Ideally, the physical environment will be designed to achieve desired behavioural outcomes. Clever use of space can be used to encourage patrons to stay longer since longer stays result in more opportunities to sell services. At other times, the ambient conditions can be manipulated to encourage avoidance behaviour. For example, at the end of a busy night of trading, a bar manager might turn the air conditioning up, turn up the lights, turn off the background music and start stacking chairs on top of tables. These actions send a signal to patrons that it is closing time.

======Customers and employees: moderating and mediating factors ======

Customers and employees represent the two groups that regularly inhabit the servicescape. Their perceptions of the environment are likely to differ, because each comes to the space with different purposes and motivations. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.

In the servicescape model, a moderator is anything that changes the standard stimulus-response emotional states of pleasure-displeasure, arousal-non-arousal or dominance-submissiveness while the mediator explains the response behaviour, typically in terms of internal responses (cognitive, emotional and physiological responses). The consumer&#x27;s response to an environment depends, at least in part, on situational factors such as the purpose or reason for being in the environment. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.

======Behavioural response======

The model shows that there are different types of response – individual response (&quot;approach&quot; and &quot;avoid&quot;) and interaction responses (e.g. &quot;social interactions&quot;).

In the context of servicescapes, &quot;approach&quot; has a special meaning. It refers to how customers utilize the space, during and after the service encounter. Approach behaviours demonstrated during the encounter include:

: &quot;Enter and explore&quot; – exhibiting a desire to explore the total service offering, a willingness to do more things, keen to learn about all the company&#x27;s products and services; showing an interest in cross-selling opportunities as presented

: &quot;Stay longer&quot; – exhibiting a willingness to remain within the physical environment; longer stays present more opportunities for cross-selling, up-selling or impulse buying. Some studies have shown a correlation between length of stay and the size of average patron expenditure

: &quot;Carry out plan&quot; – exhibiting a willingness to act on information provided, fully immerse themselves in the experience and a determination to achieve personal goals

: &quot;Social interactions&quot; refer to customer-employee interactions as well as customer-customer interactions. In some services, such as clubs, bars and tours, the act of meeting other people and interacting with other customers forms an integral part of the service experience. Managers need to think about design features that can be used to facilitate interactions between patrons. For instance, some cafeterias and casual dining establishments install communal dining tables for the express purpose of encouraging customers to mix and socialize.

Different types of approach behaviours demonstrated at the conclusion of the encounter or after the encounter may include: &quot;affiliation&quot; – a willingness to become a regular user, form intention to revisit; &quot;commitment&quot; – the formation of intention to become brand advocate, to provide referrals, write favourable online reviews or give positive word-of-mouth recommendations.

======Types of servicescape======

Bitner&#x27;s pioneering work on servicescapes identified two broad types of service environment:

: &quot;Lean servicescapes&quot; – environments that comprise relatively few spaces, contain few elements and involve few interactions between customers and employees. e.g. kiosks, vending machines, self-service retail outlets, fast food outlets. Designing lean environments is relatively straight-forward

: &quot;Elaborate servicescapes&quot; – environments that comprise multiple spaces, are rich in physical elements and symbolism, involve high contact services with many interactions between customers and employees. Examples include international hotels and ocean liners with guest accommodation, concierge, bars, restaurants, swimming pools, gymnasiums and other supplementary services where guests interact with multiple personnel during their stay which might extend over multiple days. Designing elaborate environments requires skilled design teams who are fully apprised of the desired behavioural outcomes and the corporate vision.

According to the model&#x27;s developer, the servicescape acts like a &quot;product&#x27;s package&quot; – by communicating a total image to customers and providing information about how to use the service. It can also serve as a point of difference by signalling which segments of the market are served, positioning the organization and conveying competitive distinctiveness.

=== Service process===

When customers enter a service firm they participate in a process. During that process, customers become quasi-employees; that is they are partial producers and they have the opportunity to see the organization from the employee&#x27;s perspective. To use a manufacturing analogy, customers are able to examine &#x27;unfinished goods&#x27; – that is faulty and defective goods, glitches in the production system are in full view, with obvious implications for customer enjoyment and satisfaction. In addition, customers interactions with both employees and other customers becomes part of the total service experience with obvious implications for service quality and productivity. Both customers and staff must be educated to effectively use the process. Controlling the service delivery process is more than a simple management issue. The customer&#x27;s presence in the system means that the service process must be treated as a marketing issue.

====Blueprinting for design and diagnosis====

Blueprinting is a technique designed to document the &quot;visible&quot; customer experience. In its simplest form, the service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer&#x27;s perspective. The original service blueprint is a highly visual, graphical map that delineates the key contact points in the service process and the nature of the contact – whether with physical evidence, personnel or procedures. It can be seen as a two dimensional map in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the basic steps in the process. A line of visibility is included to separate actions visible to the customer from actions out of sight. Employee latitude, which refers to the amount of discretion given to employees to vary the service process, is shown on the map a call-out sign attached to the step a shown in the figure. Process complexity is shown simply by the number of steps in the process.

It was originally intended to be used as a tool to assist with service design and structural positioning. However, since its inception it has been used extensively as a diagnostic tool, used to detect operational inefficiencies and potential trouble spots including &quot;fail points&quot; and &quot;bottlenecks&quot;. In the event that any deficiencies are identified by the blueprinting process, management can develop operational standards for critical steps in the process.

When interpreting service blueprints, there are two basic considerations, complexity and divergence. &quot;Complexity&quot; refers to the number and intricacy of the steps required to perform the service. &quot;Divergence&quot; refers to the degree of latitude, freedom, judgment, discretion, variability or situational adaptation permitted within any step of the process. 
Manipulations of the blueprint diagram might include increasing complexity, by adding more steps, or increasing divergence by allowing employees greater latitude in varying each step. In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customization. On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardizing each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design. By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage four different positioning strategies:

: &quot;Reduced Complexity:&quot; Specialization strategy
: &quot;Reduced Divergence:&quot; Volume-operations
: &quot;Increase Complexity:&quot; Product development
: &quot;Increased Divergence:&quot; Niche market strategy

Subway sandwich bars provide an excellent example of how a business can integrate both process design and the servicescape into the customer&#x27;s in-store experience. Like many fast food restaurants, Subway utilizes a &quot;race&quot; to corral customers and move them in a one-way direction. Prominently displayed &#x27;In&#x27; and &#x27;Out&#x27; signage reinforces the direction of the desired traffic flow. Customers can peruse an overhead backlit menu while they are waiting in line which speeds up the order-taking process and reduces opportunities for bottlenecks. Other signage provides customers with information about the Subway process e.g. select bread, select filling, select sauce, pay and exit. The arrangement of food behind the glass counter not only displays the choice of sandwich fillings, but supports the process since customers must select their preferences in a specific sequence, as they inch their way towards the cash register. In Australia, the distinctive moves used by Subway customers as they shuffle along the race, selecting their sandwich breads and fillings has become affectionately known as the ‘Subway shuffle&#x27;. Every aspect of Subway&#x27;s store design and layout reinforces the core objectives of customization, volume-operations (i.e. rapid turnover) and operational efficiency.

===People===

The &quot;people&quot; dimension refers to the human actors who are participants in the service encounter, namely employees and customers. For many service marketers, the human interaction constitutes the heart of the service experience. Service personnel are important because they are the &quot;face&quot; of the company and represent the company&#x27;s values to customers. Customers are important because they are the reason for being in business and are the source of revenue. Service firms must manage interactions between customers and interactions between employees and customers. Scholars have developed the concept of service-profit-chain to understand how customers and firms interact with each other in service settings. Strategically, service personnel are a source of differentiation.

Personnel are said to have a &quot;boundary-spanning role&quot; because they link the organization with its external environment by interacting with customers and feed information back to the organization As boundary spanners, front line staff are likely to encounter the various stresses associated with that role. Studies have shown that emotional labour can lead to undesirable consequences for employees including job-related stress, burnout, job dissatisfaction and withdrawal. If left untreated, these types of stressors can be very damaging to morale.

Managing the behaviour of customers and employees in the service encounter is difficult. Consistent behaviour cannot be prescribed. It can, however, be nurtured in subtle and indirect ways. Recruitment and training can help to ensure that the service firm employs the &quot;right&quot; people.

==== A dramaturgical perspective ====

For some marketing theorists, services are analogous to theatre. This analogy is also known as a &quot;dramaturgical perspective&quot;. In such an analogy, service personnel are the &quot;actors&quot;, customers are the &quot;audience&quot;; uniforms are &quot;costumes&quot;; the work setting is the &quot;stage&quot; (front-stage for areas where interaction occurs and &quot;back-stage&quot; for areas off limits to customers); discrete steps in the service process are &quot;scenes&quot; and finally the words and actions that occur represent the &quot;performance&quot;.

A dramaturgical perspective may be appropriate in specific service contexts:

* high contact services
* services with large audiences e.g. sporting stadia, educational institutions

Managerial insights generated by a dramaturgical perspective include:

* differentiates services from manufactured goods – provides a framework and vocabulary for describing and evaluating service performances
* legitimizes service work as a skilled performance – recognizes that service work is an artistic and creative endeavour
* provides service workers with a mechanism for understanding and coping with role-related stressors (by understanding that they are &#x27;in character&#x27; they are less likely to be personally affected by exchanges with difficult customers and the like) 
* focuses managerial attention on recruitment and training – recruiting people with requisite skills and training them as actors
* forces managers to think about the craft of stage management – scripting, staging, scenes, costumes and roles

When asked to perform emotional labour, employees can adopt one of two approaches:

:&quot;Deep acting&quot;: the service worker appraises the service environment and regulate their inner feelings, by actually changing their emotions from the outset

:&quot;Surface acting:&quot; the service worker pretends to express displays of emotion that are consistent with rules and policies

Some evidence suggests that employees who are able to fully immerse themselves in the role and engage in deep acting are more resilient to role-related stress. In addition, deep acting is often seen as more authentic, while surface acting can be seen as contrived and inauthentic. Service work, by its very nature, is stressful for employees. Managers need to develop techniques to assist employees manage role related stress.

===Performance: Managing service quality===

There is widespread consensus amongst researchers and practitioners that service quality is an elusive and abstract concept that is difficult to define and measure. It is believed to be a multi-dimensional construct, but there is little consensus as to what constitutes the specific dimensions. Indeed, some researchers argue that the dimensions of service quality may vary from industry to industry and that no universal set of dimensions exists for all contexts.

Within the services marketing literature, there are several different theoretical traditions that inform the understanding of service quality including the Nordic school, the Gaps model (also known as the &quot;American model&quot; and the performance only approach.

====The Nordic school====

The Nordic school was one of the earliest attempts to define and measure service quality. In this school of thought, service quality is conceptualized as consisting of two broad dimensions, namely:

: &quot;Technical quality&quot;: (What was delivered) 
: &quot;Functional quality&quot;: (How it was delivered)

The technical dimension can usually be measured – but the functional dimension is difficult to measure due to subjective interpretations which vary from customer to customer.

====The Gaps model====

The model of service quality or the &quot;gaps model&quot; as it is popularly known, was developed by team of researchers, Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, in the mid to late 1980s. and has become the dominant approach for identifying service quality problems and diagnosing their probable causes. This approach conceptualizes service quality as a gap between consumer&#x27;s expectations of a forthcoming service encounter and their actual perceptions of that encounter. Accordingly, service quality can be represented by the equation:

SQ = P − E
: where

: SQ is service quality
: P is the individual&#x27;s perceptions of given service delivery
: E is the individual&#x27;s expectations of a given service delivery

The model which provides the overall conceptual framework helps analysts to identify the service quality gap (Gap 5 in the model) and to understand the probable causes of service quality related problems (Gaps 1-4 in the model). The diagnostic value of the model accounts at least, in part, for the instrument&#x27;s continuing currency in service quality research.

The model&#x27;s developers also devised a research instrument, called SERVQUAL, to measure the size and direction of service quality problems (i.e. gap 5). The questionnaire is multi-dimensional instrument, designed to having capture five dimensions of service quality; namely reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness, which are believed to represent the consumer&#x27;s understanding of service quality. The questionnaire consists of matched pairs of items; 22 expectation items and 22 perceptions items, organized into the five dimensions which align with the consumer&#x27;s mental map of service quality dimensions. Both the expectations component and the perceptions component of the questionnaire consist a total of 22 items, comprising 4 items to capture tangibles, 5 items to capture reliability, 4 items for responsiveness, 5 items for assurance and 5 items to capture empathy. The questionnaire, which is designed to be administered in a face-to-face interview and requires a moderate to large size sample for statistical reliability, is lengthy and can take more than one hour to administer to reach respondent. In practice, researchers customarily add extra items to the 44 SERVQUAL items to capture information about the respondent&#x27;s demographic profile, prior experience with the brand or category and behavioural intentions (intention to revisit/ repurchase, loyalty intentions and propensity to give word-of-mouth referrals). Thus, the final questionnaire may have up to 60 items, which contributes to substantial time and cost in terms of administration, coding and data analysis.

====Performance-only model====

Cronin and Taylor developed a scale based on perceived performance only (i.e. excluded expectations) as a simpler alternative to SERVQUAL. The scale is known as SERVPERF and is considerably shorter than SERVQUAL, and therefore easier and cheaper to administer. Results from the use of SERVPERF correlate well with SERVQUAL. This approach utilises a different conceptualisation of service quality, which can be represented by the equation:

SQ = P
: where;

: SQ is service quality
: P is the individual&#x27;s perceptions of given service delivery

Although SERVPERF has a number of advantages in terms of administration, it has attracted criticism. The performance only instrument lacks the diagnostic value of the SERVQUAL since it includes only one variable (P) compared to SERVQUAL&#x27;s richer data with two variables (P and E). To illustrate, consider one source of quality related problems which occurs when customers have unrealistically high expectations. SERVQUAL has no problem detecting such problems, however, SERVPERF can never detect this problem because it does not capture expectations. When choosing an appropriate instrument for investigations into service quality, service marketers must weigh up the expediency of SERVPERF against the diagnostic power of SERVQUAL.

==Services dominant logic: implications for theory and practice==
Service-dominant logic (SDL) is a new way of thinking about marketing, especially the goods versus services division and especially a fresh way of thinking about customer value and the value-creation process. Vargo and Lusch did not intend for service-dominant logic to be published as a workable theory that offers solutions to everyday marketing problems and issues. Instead, it offers a framework for thinking about goods and services. Their work did not put forward hypotheses that could be tested empirically, Instead they offer &quot;foundational propositions&quot;. The original article offered eight such propositions and subsequently added two more propositions to arrive at a total of ten:

Some of the implications that have been identified in the literature include:

&quot;SDL offers the promise of a unified marketing theory&quot;: To date, marketing research and practice have failed to integrate the traditional goods/services dichotomy. Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful. Service-dominant logic, however, promises a truly unified framework. For many academics, this is the most exciting implication. It is highly likely that the 4 Ps, as the central marketing framework, is about to come to a close.

&quot;Compete Through Innovative Co-production and Co-creation&quot;: Some theorists point out that, thanks largely to the Internet, consumers have been actively engaging themselves in explicit dialogue with manufacturers and service providers. The challenge is for service firms to find innovative ways to achieve co-production and co-creation. Customer co-creation has become the foundation concept for social sharing web sites such as YouTube, Myspace and Twitter. Many companies have moved from testing products in the contrived and artificial conditions of a laboratory to product testing in customer environments. At Microsoft, for example, consumers acted as product researchers by testing Windows 2000 in their native environments. A different approach is to use embedded intelligence to provide enhanced personalized experiences.

&quot;Research Priorities&quot;: SDL has forced the discipline to review its research priorities. Researchers and scholars are beginning to identify a range of subjects that require more detailed exploration. Some theorists have argued that marketing practitioners must find new ways of understanding customers&#x27; value creation and of developing marketing strategies with an aim to engage suppliers with their customers&#x27; consumption processes in order to enhance customer satisfaction. Other research priorities include: the personalized customer experience, resource integration, improved use of IT to map processes and activities in order to increase productivity and standardize service.

<text>Apayao, officially the Province of Apayao (; ; Isnag: &quot;Provinsia nga Apayao&quot;; ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. Kabugao serves as its capital. The provincial capitol and its associated offices are located at the New Government Center in Luna.

The province borders Cagayan to the north and east, Abra and Ilocos Norte to the west, and Kalinga to the south. Prior to 1995, Kalinga and Apayao comprised a single province named &quot;Kalinga-Apayao&quot;, which was partitioned to better service the needs of individual ethnic groups.

With a population of 124,366 (as of the 2020 census) covering an area of , Apayao is the least densely-populated province in the Philippines, the least developed province in Luzon and one of the poorest.

==History==
By 20th century, Apayao is predominated by the Isneg people. They are located primarily in the highland municipalities of Kabugao and Calanasan. Majority of them live in scattered settlements along the upper reaches of the Apayao-Abulug River; while some along a major tributary of the Matalag River in Conner.

===Spanish colonial era===
Although Apayao which was then part of Cagayan, was among the earliest areas penetrated by the Spaniards in the Cordilleras, the region, inhabited by the Isneg tribe, remained largely outside Spanish control until late in the 19th century. As early as 1610, the Dominican friars established a mission in what is now the town of Pudtol. In 1684, the friars again made attempts to convert the people and established a church in what is now Kabugao.

The Spanish authorities were then able to establish in Cagayan the &quot;comandancia&quot;s of Apayao and Cabugaoan in 1891, which covered the western and eastern portions of what is now Apayao. The &quot;comandancia&quot;s, however, failed to bring total control and the Spanish government only maintained a loose hold over the area.

===American colonial era===
Apayao was established through &quot;Act No. 1642&quot; on May 9, 1907 as a sub-province of Cagayan province.

The Americans established the Mountain Province on August 13, 1908, with the enactment of &quot;Act No. 1876&quot;. Apayao was incorporated; and along with Amburayan, Benguet, Bontoc, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Lepanto, became sub-provinces of this new province.

In the early years, the sub-province underwent series of territorial changes:
* Part of Apayao was transferred to the Province of Ilocos Norte (&quot;Executive Order 21&quot;, 1920).
* 1922: A &quot;barrio&quot; of municipal district of Bayag (now Calanasan) was transferred to &quot;Namaltugan&quot;.
* 1927: Parts of the municipal district of Pinukpuk in Kalinga were annexed to Conner.
* Through &quot;EO 200&quot;, approved on September 6, 1929, &quot;barrios&quot; in &quot;Tauit&quot; were organized into a separate municipal district, Luna, effective October 1.
* Through &quot;EO 13&quot;, approved on January 21, 1936, &quot;Tauit&quot; was abolished and was annexed as a single &quot;barrio&quot; to Luna, effective February 1.
* Through &quot;EO 78&quot;, approved on December 23, 1936, &quot;Namaltugan&quot; was abolished and was annexed to Bayag and Kabugao, effective January 1, 1937.

In the early years, Apayao as a sub-province was divided into seven municipal districts, all Isneg predominated.

While the Isneg clashed with the Philippine Constabulary in the early years, the families attempted to escape the area and go into the mountains of Ilocos Norte and Abra. They were involved in an attack in Tauit in 1913.

===Japanese occupation===
In 1942, Japanese Imperial forces entered Apayao, starting a three-year occupation of the province during the Second World War. Local Filipino troops and the military forces of the 11th and 66th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP-NL, supported by the Cordilleran guerrillas, drove out the Japanese in 1945.

During the Second World War, Kabugao was occupied for a year by the Japanese; an Isneg guerilla force was organized under a United States Army captain who had escaped the Fall of Bataan. Little fighting occurred in the sub-province, but a number of Isneg fought with the American and Filipino forces in the Cagayan Valley and in the neighboring areas. The war and the post-war era seen development among the Isnegs, although slowly.

===Postwar Era===
====Kalinga-Apayao creation and splitting====

On June 18, 1966, the huge Mountain Province was split into four provinces with the enactment of &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot;. The four provinces were Benguet, Bontoc (renamed &quot;Mountain Province&quot;), Kalinga-Apayao and Ifugao. Kalinga-Apayao, along with Ifugao, became one of the provinces of the Cagayan Valley region in 1972.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Kalinga-Apayao. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and social unrest. 

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. The Kalinga-Apayao became known as a flashpoint of conflict between the Marcos dictatorship and the various indigenous peoples who lived in the area, because of the Chico River Dam Project, which, even if only the most essential part of it were built, would have submerged numerous townships in Kalinga, Mountain Province, and Apayao; and would have displaced about 100,000 indigenous people. Marcos sent three armed brigades to subdue protests, resulting in heightened tensions in the area.

Apayao was deeply affected by events that took place in its sister sub-province of Kalinga, as well as the neighboring provinces of Abra and Mountain Province (Bontoc, including the struggle against the Chico Dam Project, the struggle against the encroachment on indigenous lands of logging company Cellophil Resources Corporation owned by Marcos crony Herminio Disini, and the rise of multiple armed Cordilleran autonomy movements.

=== After the People Power Revolution ===
After Marcos was finally deposed by the civilian-led People Power Revolution in 1986, many of the activists who had joined the underground movement decided to &quot;surface,&quot; as the new administration of Corazon Aquino released political prisoners and initiated peace talks. However, anti-left sentiment in Aquino&#x27;s new cabinet, which included figures who had sided with the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, made the peace process difficult, and negotiations eventually collapsed, and the insurgency in Kalinga-Apayao persisted.

Another event in 1986 marked the beginning of political change in the region, however - the splitting of the Cordillera People&#x27;s Liberation Army from the New People&#x27;s Army. Former Catholic priest Conrado Balweg, who had left his calling and joined the NPA in 1979, had been having disagreements with the NPA leadership over tactics and objectives in the Cordillera for four years when he finally decided to split from the NPA in early April 1986, believing that Igorot interests were better served through regional struggles for liberation, rather than the national-scale conflict pursued by the NPA. Either way, this set the stage for negotiations which would eventually lead to the creation of the Cordillera Administrative Region, and Apayao as an independent province within it.

===Peace accord and creation of the Cordillera Administrative Region creation===

In September 1986, the CPLA signed the Mount Data Peace Accord with the government, which led to the creation of what became called the Cordillera Autonomous Region, although attempts to ratify actual autonomy in the region have failed due to non-ratification during plebiscites.

The Cordillera Administrative Region was established on July 15, 1987, and Kalinga-Apayao was made one of its provinces.

=== Separation of Kalinga and Apayao provinces ===
Finally, on February 14, 1995, Kalinga-Apayao was split into two independent provinces with the passage of &quot;Republic Act No. 7878&quot;.

==Geography==
Apayao is basically situated within the Cordillera Central mountains, traversed by many rivers. The province covers an area of forming the northern tip of the Cordillera Administrative Region, and is bounded on the north and east by Cagayan, west by Ilocos Norte, southwest by Abra and south by Kalinga.

The province is geographically subdivided into &quot;Upper Apayao&quot; (composed of the upland municipalities: Calanasan, Conner and Kabugao) and &quot;Lower Apayao&quot; (the lowland municipalities: Luna, Pudtol, Flora and Sta. Marcela).

Plains and valleys are used for farming. Apayao is basically composed of farmlands.

==Climate==
The prevailing climate in the province falls under Corona&#x27;s Type III Classification. It is characterized by relatively dry and wet seasons, from November to April, and wet during the rest of the year. Heaviest rain during December to February while the month of May is the warmest.

==Biodiversity==
Apayao is biologically diverse. The province is sanctuary to 139 bird species, 61 of which are endemic and 4 threatened. It also has 43 species of wild food plants eaten by the indigenous people and 50 species of medicinal plants. The province is home to critically endangered rufous hornbills, &quot;lawaan&quot; or dipterocarp trees, Raflesia flowers, and the white-winged flying fox.

The Philippine Eagle Foundation began its search of eagles in Apayao in 2011 after reports of huge eagles were roaming the area for centuries. On March 22, 2013, scientists discovered the stronghold of critically endangered Philippine eagles, the country&#x27;s national bird, in Luzon island within the vicinity of the Calanasan Lowland Forest. In January 2015, the town of Calanasan initiated a program which protected 3,000 hectares of forests under its jurisdiction. Additionally, the province of Apayao is one of the very few in the country that has an approved forest land use plan (FLUP). The first active Philippine eagle nest in Apayao was discovered in July 2015.

=== Biosphere reserve ===
On 9 July 2018, the provincial government of Apayao announced their intent for the province to be a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The province, which possesses more than 286,000 hectares of virgin forests, also noted that they have sent four of their personnel to train in the United States under the US Foreign Service to hasten the declaration of the site. On January 16, 2019, the provincial government announced that they were doing &quot;legwork for the inscription.&quot;

In July 2024, UNESCO, in the International Coordinating Council of the Man and the Biosphere Programme (ICC MAB) 36th session at Agadir, Morocco, listed Apayao’s 3,960 square kilometers lush forest areas, with Apayao River, a Biosphere Reserve, making it the fourth biosphere reserve in the country.

==Administrative divisions==
Apayao comprises 7 municipalities, all encompassed by a lone legislative district.


==Barangays==
The 7 municipalities of the province comprise a total of 133 barangays, with Barangay Malama in Conner as the most populous in 2015, and Eleazar in Calanasan as the least.
==Demographics==
The population of Apayao in the 2020 census was 124,366 people, with a density of .

Based on the 2000 census survey, Ilocanos comprised of the total provincial population of 97,058, while almost 1/3 of the population were Isnag at . Other ethnic groups in the province were the Malaueg at , Itneg at , Kalinga at , Kankanaey at , Bontoc at , and Ibaloi at .

===Languages===
The main languages of Apayao are Ilocano and Isnag.

==Economy==

Apayao is devoted to agricultural production, particularly food and industrial crops such as palay, corn, coffee, root crops and vegetables. Fruits produced include lanzones, citrus, bananas and pineapples, durian, santol, rambutan, coconut and mangosteen. Rice production totaled 98,489 metric tons in 2011. Parts of Apayao are home to rice terraces.

Economic activity is also based on livestock and poultry breeding such as swine, carabao, cattle, goat and sheep. Other additional investment includes manufacturing, food processing, furniture, crafts and house wares making.

Updated records of the Department of Trade and Industry Provincial Office reveal that existing industries in the province are furniture, garment craft, food processing, gifts and house wares, and agricultural support.

The people of Apayao also have a rich tradition of basket, handicraft, and textile weaving.

==&quot;Tauit&quot;==
Tauit (or Tawit), an Isneg settlement along the lower Apayao-Abulug River, was a former municipal district and Apayao&#x27;s first sub-provincial capital (1907–1915) until the capital was moved to Kabugao in August 1915 by virtue of &quot;Executive Order No. 45&quot;. It had been existed by the time of creation of the sub-province of Apayao.

Tauit is said to be the forerunner of the present-day Pudtol. Its seat of government at Barrio Tawit was later divided into four barangays in the municipality.

In 1913, a band of Isneg attacked Tauit, as they were infuriated by the large number of Ilocano settling in the territory under the protection of the local government.

In 1926, Allacapan was founded as its municipal district. In July 1927, the area was separated from Tauit and was organized into an independent one with the same name by virtue of &quot;EO No. 68&quot;. It was ceded to the province of Cagayan in 1928.

In 1929, a separate municipal district taken from Tauit, &quot;Macatel&quot; (later renamed Luna through a resolution), was organized through &quot;EO No. 200&quot;.

Difficulties in transportation led to the decision to abandon Tauit as a municipal district and to be represented by Luna.

Tauit was abolished through &quot;EO No. 13&quot;, issued on January 21, 1936 and effective February 1, with remaining territories annexed as a single &quot;barrio&quot; to Luna. These territories were established as the municipal district of Pudtol upon its creation on December 3, 1956 through &quot;EO No. 217&quot;.

Parts of the territories of Pudtol and Luna were later established as the municipalities of Flora and Santa Marcela; meanwhile, Tauit also comprised some parts of Lasam in Cagayan. At present, remnants of Tauit are located in northeastern Apayao and in few parts of Cagayan.

<text>Kalinga (), officially the Province of Kalinga (; ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines situated within the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. Its capital (and largest city) is Tabuk and borders Mountain Province to the south, Abra to the west, Isabela to the east, Cagayan to the northeast, and Apayao to the north. Kalinga and Apayao are the result of the 1995 partitioning of the former province of Kalinga-Apayao which was seen to better service the respective needs of the various indigenous peoples in the area.

President Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Lubuagan town the seat of government for 73 days from March 6, 1900, to May 18, 1900, before finally fleeing to his last hideout in Palanan.

==Etymology==
The province&#x27;s name is derived from the Ibanag and Gaddang noun &quot;kalinga&quot;, which means &quot;enemy&quot;, &quot;fighter&quot;, or &quot;headtaker&quot;.

==History==
===American occupation===
Kalinga was taken from Cagayan and Isabela provinces and established by the US Government through &quot;Philippine Commission Act No. 1642&quot; on May 9, 1907, as a sub-province of Lepanto-Bontoc.

Kalinga was later organized as one of the sub-provinces of Mountain Province, created by &quot;Act No. 1876&quot;.

In the early years, the subprovince underwent series of territorial changes. Part of Kalinga was transferred to another sub-province Bontoc through &quot;Executive Order No. 53&quot; in 1914. In the municipal district of Pinukpuk, barrios were moved to Balbalan in 1926; as well as parts of it to Conner in Apayao in 1927.

===Postwar era===
Kalinga became part of a province along with Apayao when the old Mountain Province was divided into four separate provinces through &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot; in 1966. Tabuc (Tabuk) was designated as the capital of Kalinga.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Kalinga-Apayao. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and social unrest. 

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. The Kalinga-Apayao became known as a flashpoint of conflict between the Marcos dictatorship and the various indigenous peoples who lived in the area, because of the Chico River Dam Project, which, even if only the most essential part of it were built, would have encompassed the municipalities of Tinglayan, Lubuagan, Pasil, and parts of Tabuk in Kalinga, as well as numerous municipalities in Mountain Province; and would have displaced about 100,000 indigenous people. Because the great value placed on deceased ancestors who were buried within these communities, the issue was not just one of livelihood, but also one of sacred grounds. Marcos sent three armed brigades to quell down the protests, resulting in heightened tensions in the area. In 1977 alone, numerous Kalinga dam protesters — including tribal leaders Lumbaya Aliga Gayudan and Macli-ing Dulag, and even a 12-year-old child — were rounded up by these forces and incarcerated for up to two months.

The 24 April 1980 murder of Macli-ing Dulag became a turning point when coverage of the murder led to public outrage. It was the first time since the 1972 declaration of Martial Law where the mainstream Philippine press managed to report on the arrests of civilians under Martial Law, and the turn of public opinion against both the Chico River Dam and Martial law, coupled with the united anger of the various peoples of the Cordillera Mountains led the Ferdinand Marcos administration to give up on the dam project. As a result, the Chico River Dam Project is now considered a landmark case study concerning ancestral domain issues in the Philippines.

=== After the People Power Revolution ===
After Marcos&#x27; 21 years in power were finally ended by the civilian-led People Power Revolution in 1986, many of the activists who had joined the underground movement decided to &quot;surface,&quot; as the new administration of Corazon Aquino released political prisoners and initiated peace talks. However, anti-left sentiment in Aquino&#x27;s new cabinet, which included figures who were aligned with the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, made the peace process difficult, and negotiations eventually collapsed, and the insurgency in Kalinga-Apayao persisted. 

Another event in 1986 marked the beginning of political change in the region, however - the splitting of the Cordillera People&#x27;s Liberation Army from the New People&#x27;s Army. Former Catholic priest Conrado Balweg, who had left his calling and joined the NPA in 1979, had been having disagreements with the NPA leadership over tactics and objectives in the Cordillera for four years when he finally decided to split from the NPA in early April 1986, believing that Igorot interests were better served through regional struggles for liberation, rather than the national-scale conflict pursued by the NPA. 

=== Peace accord and creation of the Cordillera Autonomous Region ===
In September 1986, the CPLA signed the Mount Data Peace Accord with the government, which led to the creation of what became called the Cordillera Autonomous Region, although attempts to ratify actual autonomy in the region have failed due to non-ratification during plebiscites. 

Along with Abra, Kalinga-Apayao became part of the territories in the Cordillera Administrative Region which was created through &quot;Executive Order No. 220&quot; in 1987.

===Creation as a province===
Kalinga was converted into a province on May 8, 1995 by virtue of RA No. 7878 when a majority of the voters in Kalinga-Apayao approved in a plebiscite the division of the province into two.

===Contemporary===
The capital town Tabuk became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9404&quot; which sought to convert the town into a city. The law was ratified on June 23, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the League of Cities of the Philippines questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the Supreme Court of the Philippines finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

==Geography==
Kalinga covers a total area of occupying the central section of the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. The province is bordered by Mountain Province to the south, Abra to the west, Isabela to the east, Cagayan to the northeast, and Apayao to the north.

Large swaths of the province&#x27;s lowlands are open grassland suitable for pasture, while the highlands have extensive areas of tropical rainforest. In higher elevations to the west, particularly in the mountains of Balbalan, lie some of the most intact pine forests of Luzon island. Rizal and Tabuk with their flatlands are the biggest rice producers. Next in rice production are the mountainous area, and of note are the rice terraces of Balbalan, Lubuagan, Pasil, Pinukpuk, Tinglayan, and Tanudan.

===Climate===
===Hydrology===
The province is drained mainly by the Chico River, with its headwaters in the Mountain Province and emptying into the Cagayan River. The Chico River has several tributaries: Bunog River in Tinglayan in the south; the Tanudan and Biga Rivers in the east; Pasil River in the central area; and Poswoy, Dao-angan, Mabaca and Saltan Rivers in the west.

Several small lakes can also be found in Kalinga.

===Administrative divisions===

Kalinga comprises one component city and seven municipalities, all encompassed by a single legislative district.

Tabuk was proclaimed a component city in 2007, but in November 2008 the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that its cityhood was unconstitutional. However, Tabuk had its city status reinstated by the Supreme Court on December 22, 2009.


==Barangays==
The seven municipalities and one component city of the province comprise 153 barangays, with &quot;Bulanao&quot; in Tabuk as the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Anggacan Sur&quot; in Tanudan as the least. If the City of Tabuk is excluded, &quot;Pinukpuk Junction&quot; in Pinukpuk municipality has the highest population.

==Demographics==


The population of Kalinga in the 2020 census was 229,570 people, with a density of .

On the 2000 census survey, Kalinga people comprised of the total provincial population of 173,638. Ilocanos came in second at , while other ethnic groups in the province were the Kankanaey at , Bontoc at , Tagalog at and Applai at .

===Languages===
The primary language spoken in Kalinga is Kalinga, including its dialects of Balangao, Butbut, Limos, Lower Tanudan, Lubuagan, Mabaka, Madukayang, Southern Kalingan, and Upper Tanudan. Gaddang, as well as Ilocano, Tagalog, and English are also spoken in as &quot;lingua francas&quot; with varying degrees of proficiency.

==Economy==
==Culture==

There are many sub-tribes in the province. The strong sense of tribal membership and filial loyalty results in frequent tribal unrest and occasional outright war. Due to the mountainous terrain and warrior-culture of the people, the Kalinga were able to preserve their culture despite centuries of occupation in the lowlands by the Spaniards, Americans, and the Japanese.

On February 22, 2019, the Department of Tourism announced the bid of &quot;Digdiga Ni Tupayya&quot;, a Kalinga courtship dance, to be included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

<text>The Human Torch, also known as Jim Hammond, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer and artist Carl Burgos, he first appeared in &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1 (October 1939), published by Marvel&#x27;s predecessor, Timely Comics.

The &quot;Human&quot; Torch was an android created by scientist Phineas Horton, off of the tutelage of Victor Timely. He possessed the ability to surround himself with fire and control flames. In his earliest appearances, he was portrayed as a science fiction monstrosity, but quickly became a hero and adopted a secret identity as a police officer for the New York City Police Department.

The Human Torch was one of Timely Comics&#x27; three signature characters, along with Captain America and Namor. Like many superheroes, the Human Torch fell into obscurity by the 1950s. In 1961, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby repurposed his name and powers for Johnny Storm, a member of the Fantastic Four who is a mutate instead of an android. Unlike Captain America and Namor, the Human Torch has had a small presence in post-1950s comics and is closely associated with the Golden Age.

==Publication history==
Following his debut in the hit &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1, the Human Torch proved popular enough that he soon became one of the first superheroes to headline a solo title. Through the 1940s, the Torch starred or was featured in &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; (the book&#x27;s title beginning with issue #2), &quot;The Human Torch&quot; (premiering with issue #2, Fall 1940, having taken over the numbering of the defunct &quot;Red Raven Comics&quot;), and &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; #19, 21–67, 69, 76–77, as well as appearing in several issues of &quot;All Select Comics&quot;, &quot;All Winners Comics&quot;, and &quot;Young Allies Comics&quot;.

Seeing a natural &quot;fire and water&quot; theme, Timely was responsible for comic books&#x27; first major crossover, with a two-issue battle between the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner that spanned &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #8–9—telling the same story from the two characters&#x27; different perspectives.

&quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; ended its run with #92 (June 1949), and &quot;The Human Torch&quot; with #35 (March 1949), as superheroes in general had faded in popularity. Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman—who by the early 1950s had transitioned the company to its next iteration, as Atlas Comics—attempted to revive superheroes with the anthology comic &quot;Young Men&quot; #24–28 (Dec. 1953 – June 1954), starring the Human Torch (art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers, variously, with covers and initially some panels featuring the Torch redrawn by Burgos for style consistency), along with the Sub-Mariner and Captain America. The solo title &quot;The Human Torch&quot; returned for issues #36–38 (April–Aug. 1954) before again being canceled. The Torch also appeared in stories in the briefly revived &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; and &quot;Sub-Mariner Comics&quot;, and in the anthology &quot;Men&#x27;s Adventures&quot; #28 (July 1954).

The original Human Torch debuted in present-day Marvel Comics continuity in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #4 (Nov. 1966).

Human Torch appeared as a regular character in the 2010–2013 &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; series, from issue #23 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

Starting in 2014, the Human Torch began appearing as a main character in the Marvel NOW! relaunch of &quot;The Invaders&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===

The Human Torch was an android created by Professor Phineas Horton in his lab in Brooklyn, New York for &quot;scientific&quot; purposes. At a press-conference unveiling, however, Horton&#x27;s creation burst into flames when exposed to oxygen. The android showed human-like sentience, personality, and awareness, but the spectators feared that he posed a safety threat. Public outcry led to the Torch being sealed in concrete, though he escaped due to a crack that let oxygen seep in. The Torch then inadvertently caused parts of New York City to burn and, after dealing with a mobster who wanted to gain advantage of his abilities for fire insurance (and accidentally causing the mobster&#x27;s death in an explosion), he eventually learned to control his flame, rebelled against his creator, and vowed to help humanity.

The Torch later first encountered and battled Namor the Sub-Mariner.

He would join other heroes as war broke out in Europe, and later in the Pacific, to fight the Axis powers. In his solo title&#x27;s debut issue, he acquired a young partner, Thomas &quot;Toro&quot; Raymond, the mutant son of two nuclear scientists whose exposure to radiation gave him the ability to control fire. The Human Torch also joined the New York City police force as part of his &quot;human cover&quot; under the name James &quot;Jim&quot; Hammond. He would later drop the human name and serve the police force outright as the Human Torch, fighting villains and his off-and-on foe, the Sub-Mariner.

Both the Torch and the Sub-Mariner joined with Captain America and his partner Bucky as the core of the superhero team the Invaders, fighting Nazis during World War II (in retcon stories that premiered in 1970s comics). With the Invaders, he was soon brainwashed by the Red Skull and battled the Liberty Legion. He later gave a blood transfusion to Jacqueline Falsworth, giving her superhuman powers to become Spitfire.

The Torch, the Sub-Mariner, Captain America, and Bucky banded together with the Whizzer, and Miss America in post-war America in a subsequent super-team, the All-Winners Squad (the original Captain America and Bucky&#x27;s membership were later retconned as having been the second Captain America and Bucky). In Marvel continuity, the Human Torch was responsible for the death of Adolf Hitler. When the Russians were invading Berlin, the Torch and Toro broke into Hitler&#x27;s bunker just as he was about to commit suicide, to offer him the chance to surrender himself to the Americans rather than the Russians. Hitler lunged for a red switch, presumed by the Torch to be a bomb. In return, the Human Torch blasted fire at Hitler, burning him alive.

Sometime afterward, the Torch was placed in deactivation sleep in the Mojave Desert; an atomic bomb test awoke him. Learning that Toro had been captured by the Soviets and brainwashed, the Torch rescued his old partner and learned that the nuclear bomb&#x27;s radiation had made his powers both much stronger and more unstable.

To keep Toro a young boy, the writers retconned the character slightly, claiming the Torch met him after World War II rather than at the beginning of the war. The revival lasted five issues. Later writers explained how fearing he would become a danger to those around him, the Torch flew back out into the desert and went nova, using up his energy reserve and effectively deactivating himself.

===Reactivation and joining Avengers West Coast===

In modern-day continuity, the Mad Thinker reactivated the Torch to have him battle the Fantastic Four, deactivating him when the Torch refused to kill the heroes. In a storyline in the &quot;Avengers&quot; that dealt with the secret background of its android member, the Vision revealed that the Torch&#x27;s body had been found by a renegade robot named Ultron 5, and modified to become the Vision, his mind wiped of past memories and his powers altered with the coerced help of the Human Torch&#x27;s original creator, Phineas Horton. The seed of this idea was planted by artist Neal Adams and worked out in detail in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #133–135 (May–June 1975) by writer Steve Englehart.

A later story by Roy Thomas in &quot;What If?&quot; #4 (Aug. 1977), planted the suggestion that the Vision was actually made from a second android created by Horton, named Adam II. This freed up the Human Torch for a possible revival. This was followed up by John Byrne, who had the Scarlet Witch revive the Torch in &quot;Avengers West Coast&quot;, seeking answers about her husband, the Vision, and to help Ann Raymond, wife of Tom &quot;Toro&quot; Raymond. In these stories, it was determined that the Vision had been made by Ultron out of the Torch&#x27;s spare parts, which explained their physical similarities. The Torch served the Avengers for many issues before losing his powers to save the former superheroine Spitfire in the 1990s series &quot;Namor&quot;. His powers gone, the Torch settled down with Ann Raymond.

He became the Chief of Security for Oracle, Inc., and would appear later as the CEO of Oracle, Inc., a company run by Namor. There he ran the mercenary team Heroes for Hire, and his mysterious connection to the Vision was furthered when Ant-Man (Scott Lang) declared that his internal mechanisms were identical to the Vision&#x27;s despite the differences in their appearance and powers. During the time-travel adventure &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;, the Avengers subsequently discovered Immortus, the custodian of Limbo, had used a device called the Forever Crystal to diverge the Torch&#x27;s personal timeline while keeping the two outcomes concurrent. According to this explanation, the Human Torch &quot;is&quot; the Vision, but also continues to exist as himself.

When Oracle, Inc., was closed down and Heroes for Hire disbanded, Hammond was soon asked to head Citizen V&#x27;s V-Battalion upon the retirement of Roger Aubrey, the Destroyer. While on leave from the V-Battalion as field leader of the New Invaders, he became attached to Tara, a female android based on him, whom he came to regard as a daughter of sorts. He also renewed acquaintances with Spitfire, to the dismay of her beau, Union Jack (Joey Chapman). Tara was revealed to have been created by the Red Skull; overrides on her developing personality allowed the Invaders&#x27; enemies, the Axis Mundi, to use her as a weapon against the team. As Tara heated toward overload to kill the Invaders, the Torch channeled her heat to prevent her meltdown. With his own systems then overloading, he flew high into the atmosphere, away from where he could cause harm, and detonated.

The Torch&#x27;s remains were recovered by the United Nations and sequestered for research. They were subsequently stolen by professor Zhang Chin, who used the Torch&#x27;s chemistry to create a virus weapon that caused infected persons to immolate. Captain America (Barnes) and the Sub-Mariner stopped the attack, and were able to pressure the U.S. Government into burying the Torch with full military honors.

The superhuman training camp created in the aftermath of the Civil War is named Camp Hammond, in the Torch&#x27;s honor. A statue of Hammond on the grounds bears the inscription &quot;JIM HAMMOND, THE FIRST OF THE MARVELS: He showed us that heroes can be made&quot;. When the camp was shut down by Norman Osborn, an angry mob tore down the statue.

===Avengers/Invaders===
The original Human Torch appears in the &quot;Avengers/Invaders&quot; maxi-series alongside his fellow Invaders when an incident takes them from the battlefields of World War II to the present Marvel Universe, where they encounter both the New Avengers and Mighty Avengers. During his time in the future, the Torch briefly attempts to &#x27;lead&#x27; S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Life Model Decoys against the organization in the belief that they are sentient machines that have been enslaved by the agency, but it is revealed that he has been deceived by Ultron, who had infiltrated the Helicarrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avengers/Invaders #1-12&quot;&gt;&quot;Avengers/Invaders&quot; #1–12. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weaponization===
Some time after his destruction, the pieces of his body are gathered and reassembled in a secret UN lab, until stolen by a squad of mercenaries led by Batroc the Leaper, at the behest of the Chinese science-villain Professor Pandemic. As a young boy, the Professor was rescued from Japanese authorities by the Invaders, and was fascinated by the Torch. Now, he intends to use the technology to further his goals. Captain America (James Barnes), Black Widow, and the Sub-Mariner race to prevent this from happening. The Professor used the Torch&#x27;s chemistry and cell structure to create an airborne virus that can spontaneously kill people. The Professor plans to use this virus to eradicate half of Earth&#x27;s population. Luckily, Cap is able to stop this and made sure that Jim received a proper burial.

===The Torch===
At the beginning of the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, the recently resurrected Toro is captured by A.I.M. during an attempt to kill the Mad Thinker. Initial experimentation on Toro makes the Mad Thinker realize that he can reconstruct the Torch. A.I.M. steals the Torch&#x27;s body from Arlington National Cemetery for experimentation.

After the Mad Thinker and A.I.M. spend months experimenting on the Torch&#x27;s corpse and on the captive Toro they are able to resurrect the Torch, but his memories have disappeared. The Mad Thinker gains control of the Torch using &quot;Compound D&quot;, a synthetic molecule he adapted from the Torch&#x27;s cells (H42N2C2O6), which he dubs &quot;Horton cells&quot;. Meanwhile, Toro&#x27;s powers begin to manifest themselves again and a startling discovery proves that Toro&#x27;s mutation may have been created as a result of his mother working for Horton.

The Thinker uses the Torch as a weapon of mass destruction to destroy an Estonian town. An escape attempt by Toro damages the control mechanism and sets the Torch free. He returns to the A.I.M. carrier and begins murdering everyone in sight. The Mad Thinker reveals that he has managed to synthesize more of the Compound D which can interact with living organisms and control them. As he teleports to safety the compound pours into the ocean. It reaches an Atlantean settlement below, as it was being visited by Namor, and infects the population.

As the Compound D infection spreads through New York, the Torch battles an infected Sub-Mariner and learns the nature of Compound D after Sub-Mariner attempts to infect him. Sub-Mariner is defeated and while Reed Richards can create an antidote, he cannot create enough of it fast enough. The Torch, Toro, and Johnny Storm team up and attack the Mad Thinker&#x27;s base and the Thinker at first refuses to cooperate until the Torch threatens that he will scorch the Earth clean, starting with the Thinker. The Thinker realizes the Torch&#x27;s memories are returning, and provides the antidote before teleporting away. The antidote is released and all infected victims are cured, but Reed Richards determines that the antidote breaks down all Horton cells, not just Compound D and that the Torch has only a few days before he is destroyed.

Toro attempts to investigate his past to learn of his parents&#x27; association with Professor Horton and learns that some Horton cell prototypes were stolen long ago. The Torch is visited by the Golden Age Vision who advises him to seek out Toro and aid him while he still can. Their quest takes them to an underground society called &quot;New Berlin&quot;, where the population has been taught that the Axis powers won WW2; people who leave the underground city are incinerated. The leader of the colony lures the Mad Thinker to it and then holds him captive to coerce him to cooperate. It is revealed that all citizens of New Berlin are in fact androids created from the unstable prototype Horton cells and that the atmosphere of the colony is saturated with anti-combustion chemicals to keep the citizens intact; this also prevents Toro and the Torch from using their powers and they are captured. The Thinker stabilizes the New Berlin leader&#x27;s weapon so that it can function without destroying itself. The Thinker also frees the Torch and Toro. Despite the Torch still dying from the Compound D antidote, he engages the Inhuman Torch in battle. The Inhuman Torch can absorb and manipulate all flame and siphons the flame from the Torch and Toro. The Torch manages to reignite himself and engages the Inhuman Torch in a final fight. By channeling his fire into a nova flame the Torch overload the Inhuman Torch, fusing it into an inert statue. A side effect of the Torch using the nova flame deactivates the enzyme in his body, saving his life. They bid farewell to New Berlin and the Golden Age Vision takes them back to New York. The Thinker reveals that the leader of &quot;New Berlin&quot; is himself an android. Unwilling to believe this, the leader attempts to leave New Berlin and is incinerated.

===Secret Avengers===
The Torch is later offered membership in the Secret Avengers by Captain America after Hawkeye takes over as the team&#x27;s leader. During his first mission with the group, the Secret Avengers travel to the Core, a subterranean city inhabited by an advanced race of robots called Descendants. The Torch finds that he is worshiped by the Descendants, who respectfully refer to him as &quot;Grandfather&quot;. During an encounter with a cyborg resembling the original Miss America, the Torch learns that the city was created by a man known as the Father, who created the Descendants back in the 1940s as part of a failed attempt to replicate Professor Horton&#x27;s work. The Torch is badly damaged during the Avengers&#x27; escape from the Core, and is placed in stasis until his body can be repaired.

Black Ant later frees the Torch and teleports him back to the Core, where he is repaired by Father. There, the Torch sides with the Descendants, realizing that he never quite fit in with humans. He then leads an army of robots during a raid on New York City, with the goal of forcibly assimilating the human race through the use of nanotechnology. The Torch eventually realizes that he had been brainwashed, and destroys the Orb of Necromancy, the mystical artifact that granted life to the descendants. Although the human race is saved, the Descendants are all killed as a result. Distraught, the Torch quits the Avengers and flies off to parts unknown.

===All-New Invaders===
A number of months after his resignation from the Avengers, Hammond is shown living in a small town called Blaketon, now working as a mechanic. He is forced to abandon his new life after being attacked by a squadron of Kree soldiers, resuming his identity as the Human Torch once again. After being saved by the intervention of Captain America and the Winter Soldier, the Torch joins the newly reformed Invaders.

When the Fantastic Four are declared to be unfit guardians for the children of the Future Foundation, Hammond offers to take custody of the children to provide a guardian that the FF can trust who they know will do all that he can to reunite them with their parents, even threatening to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. if he is forced to make a choice between the agency and his promise to protect the children. During the final confrontation with the forces of Counter-Earth – unleashed by the mysterious Quiet Man as part of his plan against the Fantastic Four – Sleepwalker revealed that Hammond had a soul despite his artificial origin.

==Physiology==
Earlier writers portrayed the Torch&#x27;s body as anatomically identical to human, but made out of synthetic material. Correspondingly, the Torch was shown to have human needs and human weaknesses; he has been felled by drugs, poison gas, hypnotic and telepathic attacks in both Golden Age stories and the &quot;Invaders&quot; series from the 1970s. The Torch has a heart, lungs, circulatory and digestive systems, and has been shown sleeping, eating, and drinking on more than one occasion. Toro has humorously implied that the Torch has normal human excretory functions. This concept of a living, artificial human made of synthetic flesh and blood was unique in comics, as opposed to the more common theme of a mechanical automaton that only externally resembles a human being.

After the Mad Thinker&#x27;s modification and reactivation of the Torch, writers began to portray him as clearly mechanical, containing circuits, relays, and motors, much like a traditional robot. This variable presentation of his anatomy remains an unresolved issue, whether an overlooked continuity error or explained within the fictional context of the stories. After his creation by Phineas Horton, many others have examined and experimented on the Torch&#x27;s body, including the Mad Thinker, Zhang Chin, Henry Pym, and unspecified scientists working for the United Nations. It is unclear if any of these entities have made additions to the Torch&#x27;s original body design that could explain the appearance of his mechanical components. &quot;Captain America&quot; #47 describes the Torch&#x27;s anatomy as biologically based, moving the pendulum back in the other direction: the Torch&#x27;s body has both DNA and a cellular structure, according to Zhang Chin. Other writers have continued to emphasize the Torch&#x27;s mechanical aspects, both in terms of showing metallic body components and references to the Torch having &#x27;programming&#x27; that can be altered.

The Mad Thinker has stated that the Torch&#x27;s organs are composed of &quot;Horton cells&quot; – synthetic replicas of human cells using plastic and carbon polymers that duplicate the structures found in organic human cells. These cells can be grown in a culture, and are compatible with human and mutant physiology. Even in small clusters, they are capable of generating and storing a remarkable amount of power:

* While traveling inside the Human Torch in miniaturized form, Scott Lang temporarily gained a version of the Torch&#x27;s powers after coming in contact with one of the cells that powers the Torch. This is a homage to a similar incident in which Hank Pym entered the Vision&#x27;s body and was temporarily rendered intangible.
* The Pyronanos, a type of nanomachine-based artificial beings, were created using cells secretly extracted from Jim Hammond.
* Compound D, a mind control substance created by the Mad Thinker, is made from Horton cells.
* Toro, the Torch&#x27;s teenaged sidekick, is a mutant who was exposed to Horton cells as a child. The cells bonded to his nervous system and caused his powers to manifest as an exact duplicate of the Torch&#x27;s.

Of particular note is the Torch&#x27;s synthetic blood, which in addition to being a universal blood type has been shown to have restorative properties:

* A &quot;blood transfusion&quot; from the Torch gave Spitfire her superspeed powers, and prevented her conversion to one of the undead; a second transfusion decades later saved her life and restored her youth. Aware of the initial transformation, the Hyena obtained a blood specimen from the Torch in the hopes of creating an army of Nazi speedsters. A similar transfusion to Warrior Woman reversed much of her brain damage and restored her health and power.
* The robot Ultron reported he could &quot;taste life&quot; after drinking the Torch&#x27;s blood.

==Powers and abilities==
The Human Torch is a synthetic being designed and constructed of artificial materials. He has the capacity for creative intelligence, unlimited self-motivated activity, and human-like emotions. The Torch has the ability to envelop his body in fiery plasma without harm to himself and to utilize this heat energy for various effects, including flight, formation of fiery shapes, energy releases in the form of heat blasts, &quot;nova flame bursts&quot; (highest intensity heat blasts, similar to the heat-pulse of a nuclear warhead), and concussive force blasts. The Torch has the ability to control ambient heat energy in his immediate environment, which allows him to control flames not of his own generation, makes him immune to the effects of external heat and to absorb heat from other sources. The Torch&#x27;s flame can be extinguished by lack of oxygen, or by smothering materials such as water, sand, fire-fighting foam, or heat-resistant blankets unless his flame is at such intensity that it immediately vaporizes such materials on contact.

While in flame form, the original Human Torch has engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Namor, the Sub-Mariner. He has also dug underground and through vessels like a human missile.

The upper limit of his resistance has been undefined over the years, having once walked out stronger from a nuclear blast, and on another time considered destroyed by another nuclear blast, this last one happening in the last issue of &quot;New Invaders&quot;.

The Torch was a member of the NYPD in the 1940s, and has police academy training. He has received some training in unarmed combat by Captain America, and is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers. The Torch is also an accomplished street fighter.

The Torch can live without oxygen, entering a stasis mode.

<text>Kalinga-Apayao () was a province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in the island of Luzon. It was formed, along with Benguet, Ifugao, and the new Mountain Province, from the earlier Mountain Province, with the passage of &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot; in 1966. The said law was amended by &quot;RA No. 7878&quot; in 1995, which partitioned the province into modern Kalinga and Apayao.

As part of a cult of personality, longtime President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr made gradual changes to the borders of Kalinga-Apayao over the course of his dictatorship, with the aim of making the outline of the province on a map resemble the silhouette of his own head facing towards his own native Ilocos Norte. The “Great Profile” was unfinished when Marcos was overthrown in 1986.

==History==
=== Before Mountain Province ===
Prior to the establishment of the province, the sub-provinces of Kalinga and Apayao, upon their establishment through &quot;Act No. 1642&quot; in 1907, were used to be part of Lepanto-Bontoc (as Kalinga was taken from Cagayan and Isabela) and Cagayan provinces respectively. The sub-provinces were annexed into the Mountain Province which was established through &quot;Act No. 1876&quot; in 1908.

In the early years, the sub-provinces underwent series of territorial changes:
* Part of Kalinga was transferred to another sub-province Bontoc (&quot;Executive Order 53&quot;, 1914); same as part of Apayao to the province of Ilocos Norte (&quot;EO 21&quot;, 1920).
* 1922: In Apayao, a barrio of municipal district of Bayag (Calanasan) to Namaltugan.
* 1926: In Kalinga, barrios in municipal district of Pinukpuk to Balbalan.
* 1927: Parts of the municipal district of Pinukpuk in Kalinga to Conner in Apayao.

=== As sub-provinces of Mountain Province ===
The sub-provinces became part of Kalinga-Apayao which was created along with three other new provinces comprising the old Mountain Province through &quot;Republic Act 4695&quot; on June 18, 1966. Those provinces, with Abra, would become part of the Cordillera Administrative Region, created through &quot;EO 220&quot; on July 15, 1987.

Since the creation of the sub-provinces, Tabuc (Tabuk) was designated as the capital of Kalinga. In Apayao, its first sub-provincial capital was Tauit until mid-1915, when it was moved to Kabugao via &quot;EO 45&quot;.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Kalinga-Apayao. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and social unrest. 

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. The Kalinga-Apayao became known as a flashpoint of conflict between the Marcos dictatorship and the various indigenous peoples who lived in the area, because of the Chico River Dam Project, which, even if only the most essential part of it were built, would have encompassed the municipalities of Tinglayan, Lubuagan, Pasil, and parts of Tabuk in Kalinga Province, as well as numerous municipalities in Mountain Province; and would have displaced about 100,000 indigenous people. Because the great value placed on deceased ancestors who were buried within these communities, the issue was not just one of livelihood, but also one of sacred grounds. Marcos sent three armed brigades to quell down the protests, resulting in heightened tensions in the area. In 1977 alone, numerous Kalinga dam protesters — including tribal leaders Lumbaya Aliga Gayudan and Macli-ing Dulag, and even a 12-year-old child — were rounded up by these forces and incarcerated for up to two months.

The 24 April 1980 murder of Macli-ing Dulag became a turning point when coverage of the murder led to public outrage. It was the first time since the 1972 declaration of Martial Law where the mainstream Philippine press managed to report on the arrests of civilians under Martial Law, and the turn of public opinion against both the Chico River Dam and Martial law, coupled with the united anger of the various peoples of the Cordillera Mountains led the Ferdinand Marcos administration to give up on the dam project. As a result, the Chico River Dam Project is now considered a landmark case study concerning ancestral domain issues in the Philippines.

=== After the People Power Revolution ===
After Marcos was finally deposed by the civilian-led People Power Revolution in 1986, many of the activists who had joined the underground movement decided to &quot;surface,&quot; as the new administration of Corazon Aquino released political prisoners and initiated peace talks. However, anti-left sentiment in Aquino&#x27;s new cabinet, which included figures who had sided with the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, made the peace process difficult, and negotiations eventually collapsed, and the insurgency in Kalinga-Apayao persisted. By December 1988, 52% of the barangays in the province were controlled by the New People&#x27;s Army communist insurgent group while 43% are &quot;under its influence&quot; according to the House of Representatives Committee on National Defense.

Another event in 1986 marked the beginning of political change in the region, however - the splitting of the Cordillera People&#x27;s Liberation Army from the New People&#x27;s Army. Former Catholic priest Conrado Balweg, who had left his calling and joined the NPA in 1979, had been having disagreements with the NPA leadership over tactics and objectives in the Cordillera for four years when he finally decided to split from the NPA in early April 1986, believing that Igorot interests were better served through regional struggles for liberation, rather than the national-scale conflict pursued by the NPA.

=== Peace accord and creation of the Cordillera Autonomous Region ===
In September 1986, the CPLA signed the Mount Data Peace Accord with the government, which led to the creation of what became called the Cordillera Autonomous Region, although attempts to ratify actual autonomy in the region have failed due to non-ratification during plebiscites. Having later been divided into two new provinces, Kalinga and Apayao were separately declared insurgency-free in 2010: Apayao in February, Kalinga in November.

===Abolition and partition===
By virtue of Republic Act. No 7878, signed on February 14, 1995, the sub-provinces in Kalinga-Apayao were partitioned into two new provinces, Kalinga and Apayao, with their capitals remaining as before. Both comprise the same municipalities formerly part of these sub-provinces.

A majority of voters in Kalinga-Apayao ratified the law in a plebiscite on May 8, 1995.

==Administrative divisions==
By the time Kalinga-Apayao was established, eight municipalities remained part of the subprovince of Kalinga, six municipalities in the Subprovince of Apayao as well.

Within almost three decades, two new municipalities were later created. On the same day of the creation of the province, Pasil in Kalinga was created (&quot;RA 4741&quot;); also, Santa Marcela in Apayao in 1967 (&quot;RA 4974&quot;). Meanwhile, the municipality of Quirino in Kalinga, which had established before, was abolished sometime between 1975 and 1980. Before the division in 1995, the province had 15 municipalities and 283 barangays.

<text>Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges (; 18 March 1830 – 12 September 1889) was a French historian. 

==Biography==
Coulanges was born in Paris; he was of Breton descent. After studying at the École Normale Supérieure, he attended the French School at Athens. 

===Career===
In 1853, he directed some excavations in Chios, and wrote an historical account of the island.

After his return, he held various educational positions and earned his doctorate degree with two theses: &quot;Quid Vestae cultus in institutis veterum privatis publicisque valuerit&quot; and &quot;Polybe, ou la Grèce conquise par les Romains&quot; (1858). His knowledge of Greek and Roman institutions and skepticism of contemporary scholars led him to rely on original texts. Once he formed a clear idea from the sources, he treated it as truth.

From 1860 to 1870 he was a professor of history at the faculty of letters at Strasbourg, where he had a brilliant career as a teacher, but never yielded to the influence exercised by the German universities in the field of classical and Germanic antiquities.

Fustel de Coulanges was appointed to a lectureship at the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot; in February 1870, to a professorship at the Paris faculty of letters in 1875, and to the chair of medieval history created for him at the Sorbonne in 1878, he applied himself to the study of the political institutions of ancient France. The invasion of France by the German armies during the Franco-Prussian War attracted his attention to the Germanic invasions under the Roman Empire. Pursuing the theory of J.-B. Dubos, but also transforming it, he maintained that those invasions were not marked by the violent and destructive character usually attributed to them; that the penetration of the German barbarians into Gaul was a slow process; that the Germans submitted to the imperial administration; that the political institutions of the Merovingians had their origins in the Roman laws at least as much as, if not more than, in German usages; and, consequently, that there was no conquest of Gaul by the Germans.

This thesis he sustained in his &quot;Histoire des institutions politiques de l&#x27;ancienne France&quot;, the first volume of which appeared in 1874. It was the author&#x27;s original intention to complete this work in four volumes, but as the first volume was keenly attacked in Germany as well as in France, Fustel was forced in self-defense to recast the book entirely. He re-examined all the texts and wrote a number of dissertations, which were dominated by his general idea and characterised by a total disregard for the results of such historical disciplines as diplomatic. From this crucible issued an entirely new work, less well arranged than the original, but rich in facts and critical comments. The first volume was expanded into three volumes, &quot;La Gaule romaine&quot; (1891), &quot;L&#x27;Invasion germanique et la fin de l&#x27;empire&quot; (1891) and &quot;La Monarchie franque&quot; (1888), followed by three other volumes, &quot;L&#x27;Alleu et le domaine rural pendant l&#x27;époque mérovingienne&quot; (1889), &quot;Les Origines du système féodal: le bénéfice et le patronat ...&quot; (1890) and &quot;Les Transformations de la royauté pendant l&#x27;époque carolingienne&quot; (1892).

Thus, in six volumes, he had carried the work no farther than the Carolingian period. The dissertations not embodied in his work were collected by himself and (after his death) by his pupil, Camille Jullian, and published as volumes of miscellanies: &quot;Recherches sur quelques problèmes d&#x27;Histoire&quot; (1885), dealing with the Roman colonate, the land system in Normandy; the Germanic mark, and the judiciary organization in the kingdom of the Franks; &quot;Nouvelles recherches sur quelques problèmes d&#x27;histoire&quot; (1891); and &quot;Questions historiques&quot; (1893), which contains his paper on Chios and his thesis on Polybius.

His life was devoted almost entirely to his teaching and his books. In 1875, he was elected member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, and in 1880 reluctantly accepted the post of director of the École Normale. Without intervening personally in French politics, he took a keen interest in the questions of administration and social reorganization arising from the fall of the imperialist régime and the disasters of the war.

He wished the institutions of the present to approximate more closely to those of the past and devised for the new French constitution a body of reforms which reflected the opinions he had formed upon the democracy at Rome and in ancient France. He died at Massy (then called Seine-et-Oise) in 1889.

Throughout his historical career – at the École Normale and the Sorbonne and in his lectures delivered to the empress Eugénie — his sole aim was to ascertain the truth, and in the defence of truth his polemics against what he imagined to be the blindness and insincerity of his critics sometimes assumed a character of harshness and injustice. But, in France at least, these critics were the first to render justice to his learning, his talents and his disinterestedness.

<text>Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided 8–1 in favor of the respondent, Edward Schempp, on behalf of his son Ellery Schempp, and declared that school-sponsored Bible reading and the recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in public schools in the United States was unconstitutional.

== Background ==

Public schools in Pennsylvania had been required to start the school day by reading Bible verses since 1949. By the 1960s, four more states had passed similar laws requiring daily Bible reading. Twenty-five states had laws allowing &quot;optional&quot; Bible reading, with the remainder of the states having no laws supporting or rejecting Bible reading. In eleven of those states with laws supportive of Bible reading or state-sponsored prayer, state courts had declared the laws to be unconstitutional. 

The Supreme Court had already applied the Establishment Clause to the states in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; (1947) by a process called incorporation 

Edward Schempp, a Unitarian Universalist, sued the Abington School District in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania challenging the Pennsylvania law under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 

== Lower court history ==

During the first trial in federal district court, Schempp and his children testified as to specific religious doctrines &quot;which were contrary to the religious beliefs which they held and to their familial teaching&quot;. The children testified that all of the doctrines to which they referred were read to them at various times as part of the exercises. In November 1956, Ellory Schempp decided that he would read the Quran during the daily Bible reading and informed school personnel that he would no longer stand for the recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer because he felt it was unconstitutional. 

The district court ruled in Schempp&#x27;s favor and struck down the Pennsylvania statute. The school district appealed. While that appeal was pending, the Pennsylvania legislature amended the statute to allow children to be excused from the exercises upon the written request of their parents. After the law changed, the Supreme Court vacated the first ruling and remanded the case back to the district court. Schempp believed that, even with the change to allow students to leave the classroom, his children&#x27;s relationships with their teachers and classmates would be adversely affected. The district court again ruled for Schempp. The school district appealed to the Supreme Court again, and, on appeal, the case was consolidated with a similar Maryland case, &quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot;.

The Supreme Court granted &quot;certiorari&quot; to settle the persistent and vigorous protests resulting from its previous decision in &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; regarding religion in schools. Henry W. Sawyer argued the case for Schempp.

== Supreme Court of the United States ==

=== Majority opinion ===
The Supreme Court upheld the District Court&#x27;s decision and found the Pennsylvania prayer statute unconstitutional. Writing for the Court&#x27;s majority, Justice Tom C. Clark stated, &quot;This Court has decisively settled that the First Amendment&#x27;s mandate [in the Establishment Clause] has been made wholly applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment ... in a series of cases since &quot;Cantwell&quot;. The Court explicitly upheld &quot;Engel v. Vitale,&quot; in which the Court ruled that a school&#x27;s sanctioning of a prayer violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&quot; The &quot;Abington&quot; court held that in organizing Bible reading, the school was conducting &quot;a religious exercise,&quot; and &quot;that cannot be done without violating the &#x27;neutrality&#x27; required of the State by the balance of power between individual, church, and state that has been struck by the First Amendment&quot; ().
What was unexpected, however, were the ideas expressed in the second portion of Justice Clark&#x27;s opinion written for the majority. The Court&#x27;s recognition of religious ideals as valuable to the culture of the United States in that opinion are generally not cited much by either side of the church-state debate when discussing the case and the effect it had on the United States. His opening thoughts explicitly spelled out that view in past jurisprudence with cases similar to &quot;Abington v. Schempp.&quot;

Clark continued that the Court was of the feeling that regardless of the religious nature of the citizenry, the government at all levels, as required by the Constitution, must remain neutral in matters of religion &quot;while protecting all, prefer[ring] none, and disparag[ing] none.&quot; The Court had rejected &quot;the contention by many that the Establishment Clause forbade only governmental preference of one faith over another.&quot;

Citing &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot;, Justice Clark added, &quot;We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person &#x27;to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.&#x27; Neither can it constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can it aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.&quot; Such prohibited behavior was self-evident in the Pennsylvania law requiring Bible reading (and allowing recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer) in its public schools. The Court recognized the value of such ideal neutrality from lessons of history when government and religion were either fully fused or cooperative with one another and religious liberty was nonexistent or seriously curtailed.

=== Brennan&#x27;s concurrence ===
Justice Brennan filed a concurrence more than seventy pages long which reviewed the history of the First Amendment and the relevant judicial and legislative history. Brennan argued that an originalist approach would be &quot;misdirected&quot;, giving several reasons including the ambiguity of the historical record and the increasing religious diversity of American society, which raised well-founded concerns about the traditional role of prayer and Bible reading in public schools. Brennan emphasized that the First Amendment does not require &quot;official hostility towards religion, but only neutrality&quot;.

Brennan later defended the &quot;wall of separation&quot; view of the Establishment Clause in other cases including a dissent in &quot;Marsh v. Chambers&quot; where he quoted his &quot;Schempp&quot; concurrence: &quot;to be truly faithful to the Framers &#x27;our use of the history of their time must limit itself to broad purposes, not specific practices&#x27;&quot;.

=== Stewart&#x27;s dissent ===
Justice Potter Stewart filed the only dissent in the case. He was critical of both the lower court opinions and the decision the Supreme Court had reached regarding them. He wished to remand the case to lower courts for further proceedings.

Stewart had dissented in &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; and viewed the doctrine relied on in that case as implausible, given the long history of government religious practice in the United States, including the fact that the Supreme Court opens its sessions with the declaration, &quot;God Save this Honorable Court&quot; and that Congress opens its sessions with prayers, among many other examples. Stewart believed that such practice fit with the nation&#x27;s long history of permitting free exercise of religious practices, even in the public sphere.

He declared the cases consolidated with &quot;Schempp&quot; as &quot;so fundamentally deficient as to make impossible an informed or responsible determination of the constitutional issues presented,&quot; specifically of whether the Establishment Clause was violated. As to the intent and scope of the religion clauses of the First Amendment, he stated:

He stated his agreement with the doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s embrace and application of the Bill of Rights, but pointed out the irony of such an amendment &quot;designed to leave the States free to go their own way should now have become a restriction upon their autonomy&quot;.

Other critics of the Court&#x27;s holding in &quot;Abington v. Schempp&quot; often quote the following excerpt from Justice Stewart&#x27;s opinion:

== Subsequent developments ==
The public was divided in reaction to the Court&#x27;s decision, which has sparked persistent and ongoing criticism from proponents of prayer in school. In 1964, &quot;Life&quot; magazine declared Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair, the mother of the plaintiff in one of the associated cases, to be &quot;the most hated woman in America.&quot;

Newspapers were no exception. The &quot;Washington Evening Star&quot;, for example, criticized the decision, declaring that &quot;God and religion have all but been driven from the public schools. What remains? Will the baccalaureate service and Christmas carols be the next to go? Don&#x27;t bet against it.&quot; In contrast, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more accepting of the Court&#x27;s ruling. The paper printed significant portions of the opinions with no significant comments, either supportive or critical. Opponents characterized the decision as the one which &quot;kicked God and prayer out of the schools&quot;.

The views of various religious entities on the decision split between mainline Protestants and Jews, who in general strongly supported the decision, and evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics, who strongly opposed the decision. Speaking from the evangelical perspective, Billy Graham said, &quot;[i]n my opinion... the Supreme Court... is wrong... Eighty percent of the American people want Bible reading and prayer in schools. Why should a majority be so severely penalized...?&quot; The mainline denominations, with the exception of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed less critical opinions of the verdict. Some considered it to support religious freedom because it limited governmental authority in the sphere of public schools.

The United States Congress reacted by drafting more than 150 resolutions to overturn the ruling by a constitutional amendment. &quot;Abington&quot; was used as precedent in similar cases such as &quot;Board of Education v. Allen&quot; and &quot;Lemon v. Kurtzman&quot; in the decades that followed. The three-part &quot;Lemon&quot; test had its basis in &quot;Abington&quot;. Under the test, the constitutionality of a church-state law is weighed by three criteria: whether a law has a non-secular purpose, advances or inhibits religion, or results in excessive government entanglement with religion.

The Supreme Court overturned the &quot;Lemon&quot; test in the 2022 decision of &quot;Kennedy v. Bremerton School District&quot;, in which the Court ruled that a coach who held a private prayer on the sports field, joined voluntarily by students and others, did not violate the Establishment Clause, and that the First Amendment protected the coach&#x27;s right to such prayer. However, that decision did not explicitly overrule &quot;Schempp&quot; and restrictions against school prayer.

<text>The Land letter was a letter sent to U.S. President George W. Bush by five evangelical Christian leaders on October 3, 2002, outlining their support for a just war pre-emptive invasion of Iraq. As its foundation for support, the letter refers to the &quot;criteria of just war theory as developed by Christian theologians in the late fourth and early fifth centuries A.D.&quot; The letter was written by Richard D. Land, president of the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. It was co-signed by:

* Chuck Colson, founder of Prison Fellowship Ministries
* Bill Bright, chairman of the Christian organization Cru
* James Kennedy, president of Coral Ridge Ministries, and
* Carl D. Herbster, president of the American Association of Christian Schools

The letter asserted that a pre-emptive invasion of Iraq met the criteria of traditional &#x27;just war&#x27; theory because:
* such an action would be &quot;defensive&quot;
* the &quot;intent&quot; is found to be just and noble. The United States does not intend to &#x27;destroy, conquer, or exploit Iraq&#x27;
* it is a &quot;last resort&quot; because Saddam Hussein had a record of attacking his neighbors, of the &#x27;headlong pursuit and development of biochemical and nuclear weapons of mass destruction&#x27; and their use against his own people, and harboring Al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorists
* it is authorized by a &quot;legitimate authority&quot;, namely the United States
* it has &quot;limited goals&quot;
* it has &quot;reasonable expectation of success&quot;
* &quot;non-combatant&quot; immunity would be observed
* it meets the criteria of &quot;proportionality&quot;—the human cost on both sides would be justified by the intended outcome

<text>The Maillard reaction ( ; ) is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars to create melanoidins, the compounds that give browned food its distinctive flavor. Seared steaks, fried dumplings, cookies and other kinds of biscuits, breads, toasted marshmallows, falafel and many other foods undergo this reaction. It is named after French chemist Louis Camille Maillard, who first described it in 1912 while attempting to reproduce biological protein synthesis. The reaction is a form of non-enzymatic browning which typically proceeds rapidly from around . Many recipes call for an oven temperature high enough to ensure that a Maillard reaction occurs. At higher temperatures, caramelization (the browning of sugars, a distinct process) and subsequently pyrolysis (final breakdown leading to burning and the development of acrid flavors) become more pronounced.

The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the nucleophilic amino group of the amino acid and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of aromas and flavors. This process is accelerated in an alkaline environment (e.g., lye applied to darken pretzels; see lye roll), as the amino groups () are deprotonated, and hence have an increased nucleophilicity. This reaction is the basis for many of the flavoring industry&#x27;s recipes. At high temperatures, a probable carcinogen called acrylamide can form. This can be discouraged by heating at a lower temperature, adding asparaginase, or injecting carbon dioxide.

In the cooking process, Maillard reactions can produce hundreds of different flavor compounds depending on the chemical constituents in the food, the temperature, the cooking time, and the presence of air. These compounds, in turn, often break down to form yet more flavor compounds. Flavor scientists have used the Maillard reaction over the years to make artificial flavors, the majority of patents being related to the production of meat-like flavors.

== History ==
In 1912, Louis Camille Maillard published a paper describing the reaction between amino acids and sugars at elevated temperatures. In 1953, chemist John E. Hodge with the U.S. Department of Agriculture established a mechanism for the Maillard reaction.

== Foods and products ==

The Maillard reaction is responsible for many colors and flavors in foods, such as the browning of various meats when seared or grilled, the browning and umami taste in fried onions and coffee roasting. It contributes to the darkened crust of baked goods, the golden-brown color of French fries and other crisps, browning of malted barley as found in malt whiskey and beer, and the color and taste of dried and condensed milk, &quot;dulce de leche&quot;, toffee, black garlic, chocolate, toasted marshmallows, and roasted peanuts.

6-Acetyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine is responsible for the biscuit or cracker-like flavor present in baked goods such as bread, popcorn, and tortilla products. The structurally related compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline has a similar smell and also occurs naturally without heating. The compound gives varieties of cooked rice and the herb &quot;pandan&quot; (&quot;Pandanus amaryllifolius&quot;) their typical smells. Both compounds have odor thresholds below 0.06 nanograms per liter.

The browning reactions that occur when meat is roasted or seared are complex and occur mostly by Maillard browning with contributions from other chemical reactions, including the breakdown of the tetrapyrrole rings of the muscle protein myoglobin. Maillard reactions also occur in dried fruit and when champagne ages in the bottle.

Caramelization is an entirely different process from Maillard browning, though the results of the two processes are sometimes similar to the naked eye (and taste buds). Caramelization may sometimes cause browning in the same foods in which the Maillard reaction occurs, but the two processes are distinct. They are both promoted by heating, but the Maillard reaction involves amino acids, whereas caramelization is the pyrolysis of certain sugars.

In making silage, excess heat causes the Maillard reaction to occur, which reduces the amount of energy and protein available to the animals that feed on it.

== Archaeology ==
In archaeology, the Maillard process occurs when bodies are preserved in peat bogs. The acidic peat environment causes a tanning or browning of skin tones and can turn hair to a red or ginger tone. The chemical mechanism is the same as in the browning of food, but it develops slowly over time due to the acidic action on the bog body. It is typically seen on Iron Age bodies and is the result of the interaction of anaerobic, acidic, and cold (typically ) sphagnum acid on the polysaccharides.

The Maillard reaction also contributes to the preservation of paleofeces.

== Chemical mechanism ==
# The carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the amino group of the amino acid, producing N-substituted glycosylamine and water
# The unstable glycosylamine undergoes Amadori rearrangement, forming ketosamines
# Several ways are known for the ketosamines to react further:
#* Produce two water molecules and reductones
#* Diacetyl, pyruvaldehyde, and other short-chain hydrolytic fission products can be formed.
#* Produce brown nitrogenous polymers and melanoidins


The open-chain Amadori products undergo further dehydration and deamination to produce dicarbonyls.
This is a crucial intermediate.

Dicarbonyls react with amines to produce Strecker aldehydes through Strecker degradation.

Acrylamide, a possible human carcinogen, can be generated as a byproduct of Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids, especially asparagine, both of which are present in most food products.

<text>English billiards, called simply billiards in the United Kingdom and in many former British colonies, is a cue sport that combines the aspects of carom billiards and pool. Two (one white and one yellow) and a red are used. Each player or team uses a different cue ball. It is played on a billiards table with the same dimensions as one used for snooker and points are scored for and pocketing the balls.

==History==
English billiards originated in England, and was originally called the &quot;winning and losing carambole game&quot;, folding in the names of three predecessor games, &quot;the winning game&quot;, &quot;the losing game&quot;, and an early form of carom billiards that combined to form it.

The winning game was played with two white balls, and was a 12- contest. To start, the player who could strike a ball at one end of the table and get the ball to come to rest nearest the opposite cushion without lying against it earned the right to shoot for points first. This is the origin of the modern custom of &quot; (or &quot;). 

A player who pocketed the opponent&#x27;s ball scored two points, as is still the case in modern billiards. A player missing the opponent&#x27;s ball, considered a , added one point to the opponent&#x27;s total; the shooter conceded two points if their own ball went into a pocket after striking the opponent&#x27;s ball; and the player conceded three points if the cue ball was pocketed without even hitting the opponent&#x27;s ball. These rules continued to exist in English billiards until 1983, when a standard of two points for all fouls was introduced.

By contrast, in the losing game a player could only score two points by pocketing the cue ball through a off the opponent&#x27;s ball. &quot; and &quot; are terms still mentioned in the official rules for these two fundamental shot types, although &quot; and &quot; have become the usual terms for them in British English.

The final element was the &quot;&quot; (or ) shot, which came from carom billiards, a game popular in various countries of western Continental Europe, especially France, and in many parts of Asia and South America. In the 1700s, the carom game added a red to the two white cue balls, and dispensed with the pockets. This ball was adopted into the English game, which retained the pockets, and the goal was to cannon off both the red and the opponent&#x27;s ball on a single shot, earning 2 points. This influence on the English game appears to have come about through the popularity of French tables in English coffee houses; London alone had over two thousand such establishments in the early 18th century. One period advertisement read: &quot;A very good French Billiard Table, little the worse for wearing, full size, with all the materials fit for French or English play&quot;.

The three ancestral games had their British heyday in the 1770s, but had combined into English billiards, with a 16-point score total, by approximately 1800. The skill required in playing these games helped retire the in favour of the cue stick.

There are a number of pocket billiard games directly descended from English billiards, including bull dog, scratch pool, thirty-one pool and thirty-eight. The last of these gave rise to the more well-known game cowboy pool. English Billiards was virtually unknown in the United States until 1913, when Melbourn Inman visited the US and played the game against Willie Hoppe. By 1915 the game had become rather popular, prompting American billiard hall proprietors of the period to increase the number of English-style tables in their establishments. It also became favored in British colonies; the game&#x27;s longest-running champion was an Australian, Walter Lindrum, who held the World Professional Billiards Championship from 1933 until his retirement in 1950. The game remains popular in the UK, although it has been eclipsed by snooker.

===As a sport===
The first governing body of the game, the Billiards Association, was formed in the UK in 1885, a period that saw a number of sporting bodies founded across the British sporting world. By the mid-20th century, the principal sanctioning body was the Billiards Association and Control Council (later the Billiards and Snooker Control Council), formed in 1919 by an amalgamation of the Billiards Association and the Billiards Control Club (founded in 1908).

In the 19th century and up through the mid-1950s, a common way for championship titles to change hands was by a &quot;challenge match&quot;. A challenge was issued to a championship title holder accompanied by money held by a third party. Up until the first organised professional tournament in 1870, all English billiards champions were decided by challenge.

The first champion was Jonathan Kentfield, who held the title from 1820 to 1849, losing it to John Roberts Sr. after Kentfield refused his challenge. Roberts&#x27;s 21-year reign lasted until he lost to William Cook in 1870. That year was also the first in which an English billiards challenge match was held in the United States.

From 1870 to 1983 the champions were: William Cook, (1870, 1871–74); John Roberts Jr., (1870, 1871, 1875–77, 1885); Joseph Bennett, (1870, 1880–81); Charles Dawson, (1899–1900, 1901, 1903); H. W. Stevenson, (1901, 1909–11); Melbourne Inman, (1908–09, 1912–19); Willie Smith, (1920, 1923); Tom Newman, (1921–22, 1924–27); Joe Davis, (1928–32); Walter Lindrum, (1933–50); Clark McConachy, (1951–68); Rex Williams, (1968–76, 1982–83); and Fred Davis, (1980).

A &quot;Women&#x27;s Billiard Association&quot; was formed in Britain in 1931. One of the founders was Teresa Billington-Greig who had been a leading suffragette and was then married to a billiard ball manufacturer.

Over the course of the 20th century, English billiards was largely superseded as the favoured cue sport in the United Kingdom by snooker and the rise of English-style eight-ball pool. The game does retain some popularity amongst snooker players, who can use the same equipment for both games and play the game to practise ball control.

==Rules==

===Balls and table===

There are three balls. They are the same size as snooker balls (52.5 mm or  in with a tolerance of 0.05 mm) and they must weigh the same to a tolerance of 0.5 g within a set.

The balls are designated as:
:* White – the for player 1, and an for player 2
:* Yellow – the cue ball for player 2, and an object ball for player 1 (historically a white ball with spots was used)
:* Red – an object ball for both players

The billiard table used has the same dimensions as in snooker, and in many venues, both games are played on the same equipment. The playing area of a standard tournament table measures 11 feet 8 inches by 5 ft 10 in (3.569 m by 1.778 m) with a tolerance of inch (1.26 cm) in both directions, though smaller ones, down to half size, are often found in snooker halls, pubs and home billiard rooms.

===Beginning the game===

To see who will be the starting player, players perform a , where both simultaneously hit a cue ball up the table, bouncing it off the top cushion so that it returns to (the first quarter-length of the table). The player who gets their ball closer to the baulk cushion can now choose which cue ball they want to use during the game and to break or let the opponent break.

The red ball is placed on the at the of the table (same as the in snooker) and the first player begins by playing in-hand from behind the baulk line. The other cue ball remains off the table until the opponent&#x27;s first turn, when they play in hand from the &quot;D&quot;.

The idea is to leave the balls by creating either a double baulk (both object balls in baulk), or the red in baulk with the cue-ball () to the top-side cushion.

===Scoring===

Points are awarded as follows:

* – striking the cue ball so that it hits, in any order, the other cue ball and the red ball on the same shot: 2 points.
* (or , in snooker terms) – striking another ball with one&#x27;s cue ball so that the red enters a pocket: 3 points; or striking another ball with one&#x27;s cue ball so that the other cue ball enters a pocket: 2 points.
* ( in snooker terms) – striking one&#x27;s cue ball so that it hits another ball and then enters a pocket: 3 points if the red ball was hit first; 2 points if the other cue ball was hit first; 2 points if the red and the other cue ball are hit simultaneously.

Combinations of the above may all be scored on the same shot. The most that can be scored in a single shot is therefore 10 – the red and the other cue ball are both potted via a cannon (the red must be struck first), and the cue ball is also potted, making a losing hazard off the red.

The winner is determined by a player reaching a fixed number of points set at the start of the game, or by which player is leading at the end of a timed game.

===Other rules===
If the red is potted it is on the spot at the top of the table (the black spot). After the red has been potted twice off the spot in a row (i.e. without a cannon or losing hazard), it is respotted on the . If the middle spot is occupied, it goes on the (the pink spot in snooker). If both the middle and pyramid spots are occupied, it goes back on the spot. When potted from the middle or pyramid spot, it returns to the spot at the top of the table.

After a losing hazard, play continues in-hand from the &quot;D&quot;. When playing from in-hand, a striker must touch a ball or cushion out of baulk before striking a ball in baulk.

If playing in-hand and all balls on the table are in baulk, and contact is not made with any ball, this is a miss; 2 points are awarded to the opponent, who must play from where the balls have come to rest.

If an opponent&#x27;s cue ball is potted, it remains off the table until it is that opponent&#x27;s turn to play, when it is returned to that player, who may play it in-hand from the &quot;D&quot;. There is one exception to this rule: if the non-striker&#x27;s ball is off the table as a result of the final stroke of the non-striker’s last turn. If the striker then makes 15 consecutive hazards, the non-striker&#x27;s ball is spotted, after the fifteenth hazard, in the Middle of the Baulk-line or, if that spot is occupied, on the right-hand corner of the &quot;D&quot;, as viewed from baulk. It becomes a &quot;line ball&quot; and may not be played directly from baulk.

If the cue ball is touching an object ball, then the balls must be respotted: red on its spot and opponent&#x27;s ball in the centre spot, with the striker to play from in-hand.

Matches held under professional regulations include a rule forcing the player to execute a shot in a way to have his cue ball cross the baulk line, heading towards the baulk cushion, once between 80 and 99 points in every 100 in a running break.

===Fouls===
If a foul occurs, two points are awarded to the opposing player who has the choice of playing from where the balls lie or they can be respotted.

There are a few different ways a foul can occur, by:
*Playing/Striking the opponent&#x27;s cue ball or Red object ball
*Making any ball jump off the table
*Failing to make contact between one&#x27;s cue ball and at least one object ball (unless double baulked)
*A double-hit or push shot
*Jumping one&#x27;s cue ball over an object ball
*Playing a 16th consecutive hazard or 76th consecutive cannon
*When in-hand, not hitting an object ball or cushion out of baulk before hitting a ball in baulk.

<text>Dayna Curry (born November 4, 1971) is an American citizen, who was held a prisoner by Taliban government of Afghanistan in 2001. She befriended fellow aid worker Heather Mercer while attending Antioch Community Church in Waco, Texas. In 2001 the pair were part of a German-based missionary group called Shelter Now International when they were imprisoned by the Taliban for proselytization. Their captivity coincided with the September 11 attacks and the beginning of the US-led War in Afghanistan. In November 2001, Curry and her fellow workers were rescued from Taliban captivity by US military forces.

==Early life==
Curry was raised in Forest Hills, Tennessee. In 1989, she graduated from Brentwood High School in Brentwood, Tennessee and went to Baylor University in Waco, Texas. A social work major, Dayna volunteered at the Waco Center for Youth (a residential facility treats teenagers with emotional and behavioral problems) while she was attending Baylor. After graduation, Curry took a job as a social worker at a high school for troubled teens in Waco.

Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer got to know each other in Waco when they both joined the Antioch Community Church, an evangelical, non-denominational church.

==Imprisonment and rescue==
In March 2001, Curry and Heather Mercer traveled to Afghanistan to join the German-based aid agency Shelter Now International, which worked with Afghan women and children in Kabul. Their colleagues included four German and two Australian aid workers. On August 3, 2001, Curry and her fellow aid workers were arrested by the ruling Taliban regime for allegedly preaching Christianity in the strict Islamic state. The two were visiting a private home in Kabul when they were arrested. The Taliban, which forbade foreigners from visiting local homes, allege that the two women went beyond their activities with helping the needy and began spreading the Christian gospel, a crime under Taliban law. The women had been showing the &quot;Jesus&quot; film.

A joint trial for the imprisoned aid workers began September 1 in Kabul. At first, it appeared that their punishment might be minor, a short time in prison followed by expulsion from the country. Then came the September 11 attacks on the United States. Their trial was suspended, and their relatives were ordered out of Kabul. After more than three months of confinement in Taliban prisons they were picked up on November 15, 2001, by the U.S. military.

==Return to the United States==
After their release and subsequent return to the United States, Curry and Mercer met with President George W. Bush at the White House on November 26, 2001. The two co-authored a book entitled &quot;Prisoners of hope: the story of our captivity and freedom in Afghanistan&quot;, that was published in 2002.

<text>Invertebrate paleontology (also spelled invertebrate palaeontology) is sometimes described as invertebrate paleozoology or invertebrate paleobiology.
Whether it is considered to be a subfield of paleontology, paleozoology, or paleobiology, this discipline is the scientific study of prehistoric invertebrates by analyzing invertebrate fossils in the geologic record.

By &quot;invertebrates&quot; are meant the &quot;non-vertebrate&quot; creatures of the kingdom Animalia (or Metazoa) in the biotic domain of Eukaryota. By phyletic definition, these many-celled, &quot;sub-vertebrate&quot; animals lack a vertebral column, spinal column, vertebrae, backbone, or long, full-length notochord—in contrast to the vertebrates in the one phylum of Chordata.

Relatedly, invertebrates have never had a cartilaginous or boney internal skeleton, with its skeletal supports, gill slits, ribs and jaws. Finally, throughout geologic time, invertebrates have remained non-craniate creatures; that is, they never developed a cranium, nerve-chord brain, skull, or hard protective braincase (unlike many vertebrates).

==Invertebrate terminology in science==

In the many decades since Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, a pioneering biologist and evolutionist, first conceptualized and coined the category &quot;Invertebrata&quot; (between 1793 and 1801) and the term &quot;Biology&quot; (in 1802), zoology has come to recognize that the &quot;non-vertebrate&quot; category is not a scientifically valid, monophyletic taxon. Evolutionary biology and developmental biology (a.k.a. &quot;evo-devo&quot;) now consider the term &quot;Invertebrata&quot; to be both polyphyletic and paraphyletic. Nevertheless, most earth science departments continue to employ this term; and paleontologists find it both useful and practical in evaluating fossil invertebrates and—consequently—invertebrate evolution.

However, there is one contemporary caveat: Paleobiologists and microbiologists in the 21st century no longer classify one-celled &quot;animal-like&quot; microbes &quot;either&quot; as invertebrates &quot;or&quot; as animals.
For example, the commonly fossilized foraminifera (&quot;forams&quot;) and radiolarians—zooplankton both formerly grouped under either an animal phylum or animal sub-kingdom called Protozoa (&quot;first animals&quot;)—are now placed in the kingdom or super-kingdom Protista or Protoctista (and thus called &quot;protists&quot; or &quot;protoctists&quot;).

Thus modern invertebrate paleontologists deal largely with fossils of this more strictly defined Animal Kingdom (excepting Phylum Chordata), Phylum Chordata being the exclusive focus of vertebrate paleontology. Protist fossils are then the main focus of micropaleontology, while plant fossils are the chief focus paleobotany. Together these four represent the traditional taxonomic divisions of paleontologic study.

===Origins and modern evolution===


==Invertebrate fossilization==

When it comes to the fossil record, &quot;soft-&quot;bodied and &quot;minuscule&quot; invertebrates—such as hydras, jellies, flatworms, hairworms, nematodes, ribbon worms, rotifers and roundworms—are infrequently fossilized. As a result, paleontologists and other fossil hunters must often rely on trace fossils, microfossils, or chemofossil residue when scouting for these prehistoric creatures.

&quot;Hard-&quot;bodied and &quot;large&quot; invertebrates are much more commonly preserved; typically as sizeable macrofossils. These invertebrates are more frequently preserved because their hard parts fossilise more readily—for example, shell, armor, plates, tests, exoskeleton, jaws or teeth. In invertebrates, these parts are composed of silica (silicon dioxide), calcite or aragonite (both forms of calcium carbonate), chitin (a protein often infused with tricalcium phosphate), or keratin (an even-more complex protein), rather than the vertebrate bone (hydroxyapatite) or cartilage of fishes and land-dwelling tetrapods.

The chitinous jaws of annelids (such as the marine scolecodonts) are sometimes preserved as fossils; while many arthropods and inarticulate brachiopods have easily fossilized hard parts of calcite, chitin, or keratin. The most common and often-found macrofossils are the very hard calcareous shells of articulate brachiopods (that is, the everyday &quot;lampshells&quot;) and of mollusks (such as the omnipresent clams, snails, mussels and oysters). On the other hand, shell-less slugs and non-tubiferous worms (for instance, earthworms) lack hard parts and therefore such organisms are poorly represented in the fossil record.

<doc id="274692" wikidata="Q1371525" url="?curid=274692" title="Ethyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, an ethyl group (abbr. Et) is an alkyl substituent with the formula , derived from ethane (). &quot;Ethyl&quot; is used in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry&#x27;s nomenclature of organic chemistry for a saturated two-carbon moiety in a molecule, while the prefix &quot;eth-&quot; is used to indicate the presence of two carbon atoms in the molecule.

==Ethylation==
Ethylation is the formation of a compound by introduction of the ethyl group. The most widely practiced example of this reaction is the ethylation of benzene with ethylene to yield ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is a precursor to polystyrene. Approximately 24.7 million tons of ethylbenzene were produced in 1999. 

Many ethyl-containing compounds are generated by electrophilic ethylation, i.e. treatment of nucleophiles with sources of Et+. Triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate [Et3O]BF4 is such a reagent. For good nucleophiles, less electrophilic reagents are employed, such as ethyl halides.

==Stereochemistry==
In unsymmetrical ethylated compounds, the methylene protons in the ethyl substituent are diastereotopic. Chiral reagents are known to stereoselectively modify such substituents.

== Etymology ==
The name of the group is derived from the Aether, the first-born Greek elemental god of air (and at that time a general term for any highly volatile compound) and &quot;hyle&quot;, referring to &quot;stuff&quot;. The name &quot;ethyl&quot; was coined in 1835 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius.

<text>Rye whiskey can refer to two different, but related, types of whiskey:
* American rye whiskey, which is similar to bourbon whiskey, but must be distilled from at least 51 percent rye grain
* Canadian whisky, which is often referred to as (and often labelled as) rye whisky for historical reasons, although it may or may not actually include any rye grain in its production process.

==American rye whiskey==

In the United States, rye whiskey is, by law, made from a mash of at least 51 percent rye. (The other ingredients in the mash are usually corn and malted barley.) It is distilled to no more than 160 U.S. proof (80% abv) and aged in charred, new oak barrels. The whiskey must be put in the barrels at no more than 125 proof (62.5% abv). Rye whiskey that has been aged for at least two years and has not been blended with other spirits may be further designated as straight, as in &quot;straight rye whiskey&quot;.

===History===
Rye whiskey was historically the prevalent whiskey in the northeastern states, especially Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland. Pittsburgh was the center of rye whiskey production in the late 1700s and early 1800s. By 1808, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania farmers were selling half a barrel for each man, woman and child in the country. By the 1880s, Joseph F. Sinnott&#x27;s distillery, Moore and Sinnott, located in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, was the largest producer of rye whiskey, with a capacity of 30,000 barrels a year. In 1886, rye whiskey was produced in 17 states.

Rye whiskey largely disappeared after Prohibition. A few brands, such as Old Overholt, survived, although by the late 1960s former Pennsylvania brands like Old Overholt were being distilled mostly in Kentucky.

In the early 21st century, an expanding number of rye whiskey brands are produced by Campari Group (Wild Turkey Rye), Diageo (George Dickel Rye and Bulleit Rye), Heaven Hill (Pikesville Rye and Rittenhouse Rye), Suntory Global Spirits (Old Overholt and Jim Beam Rye), The Sazerac Company (Col. E. H. Taylor, Sazerac Rye, and Thomas H. Handy), and various smaller companies. A particularly large producer is MGP of Indiana (formerly known as Lawrenceburg Distillers Indiana), which is a distiller for many brands that are marketed by others (including some of the large companies previously listed).

Rye whiskey has been undergoing a small but growing revival in the US. Since the beginning of the 21st century, more producers have been experimenting with rye whiskey, and several now market aged rye whiskey. For example, Brown-Forman began production of a Jack Daniel&#x27;s rye whiskey and released unaged and lightly aged versions as limited editions. A reconstructed distillery at Mount Vernon (the estate of George Washington) sells a rye that is similar to the whiskey Washington made. At its peak, Washington&#x27;s original distillery was among the largest producers of rye whiskey in the United States, averaging per year. In 2023, Maryland passed legislation naming Maryland rye whiskey as the state&#x27;s official liquor.

===Differences between rye and bourbon===
Rye grain is known for imparting what many call a spicy or fruity flavor to the whiskey. Bourbon, distilled from at least 51% corn, is noticeably sweeter and tends to be more full-bodied than rye. As bourbon gained popularity beyond the southern United States, bartenders increasingly substituted it for rye in cocktails such as the whiskey sour, Manhattan, and Old Fashioned, which were originally made with rye. All other things being equal, the character of the cocktail will be drier (i.e., less sweet) with rye.

===Styles===
American straight rye whiskey has historically been subdivided into regional styles, which differ in the rye content of the mash and subsequent flavor profiles. Typically, the more rye in the mash bill, the spicier the whiskey should be, aging notwithstanding. 

Maryland-style, for example, historically contained 65-70% rye and 30-35% corn in the mash bill, and generally had a sweet flavor. Pennsylvania-style, also called Monongahela rye, conversely, was traditionally made with a very high percentage of rye in its mash bill, upwards of 95%, and is generally spicier.

Kentucky-style rye is characterized by even sweeter profile than Maryland-style, as its mash bill is normally 51-55% rye, only slightly to the minimum required for a straight rye, with the remaining grains being a mix of corn and malted barley. Because of its relatively low rye content, it is comparable to high-rye bourbons.

With the decline of straight rye whiskey after Prohibition, and the subsequent closure of large distilleries in Maryland and Pennsylvania, the historic distinctions were mostly lost, though the 21st century revival of American straight rye has seen modern producers describe their productions in terms of these historic styles.

==Canadian rye whisky==
Canadian whisky is often referred to as &quot;rye whisky&quot; because historically much of the content was from rye. There is no requirement for rye to be used to make Canadian whisky, and the labels &quot;Canadian whisky&quot;, &quot;Canadian rye whisky&quot; and &quot;Rye whisky&quot; are all legally permitted, regardless of the actual composition, provided the whiskies &quot;possess the aroma, taste and character generally attributed to Canadian whisky&quot;.

In modern practice, most Canadian whiskies are blended to achieve this character, primarily consisting of a high-proof base whisky typically made from corn or wheat and aged in used barrels combined with a small amount of flavoring whisky made from a rye mash and distilled to a lower proof. In some cases, the corn-to-rye ratio may be as high as 9:1. There are a few exceptions, such as Alberta Premium and Canadian Club Chairman&#x27;s Select, which are made from 100% rye mash.

Canadian whisky must be aged in wooden barrels that are not larger than for at least three years, and the barrels do not have to be new oak or charred. This requirement differs from regulations for U.S. blended whiskey, in which the bulk base spirits are not required to be aged.

==Rye elsewhere==
Scotch whisky distillers were using rye as a mash ingredient for grain whisky in the 18th century. By the 2020s, tariffs on biogas producers had led to an increase in availability of the grain, leading modern distilleries to begin experimenting with the new raw material.

<doc id="274699" wikidata="Q1074131" url="?curid=274699" title="Chinese character encoding">
<text>In computing, Chinese character encodings can be used to represent text written in the CJK languages—Chinese, Japanese, Korean—and (rarely) obsolete Vietnamese, all of which use Chinese characters. Several general-purpose character encodings accommodate Chinese characters, and some of them were developed specifically for Chinese.

In addition to Unicode (with the set of CJK Unified Ideographs), local encoding systems exist. The Chinese Guobiao (or GB, &quot;national standard&quot;) system is used in mainland China and Singapore, and the (mainly) Taiwanese Big5 system is used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as the two primary &quot;legacy&quot; local encoding systems. Guobiao is usually displayed using simplified characters and Big5 is usually displayed using traditional characters. There is however no mandated connection between the encoding system and the font used to display the characters; font and encoding are usually tied together for practical reasons.

The issue of which encoding to use can also have political implications, as GB is the official standard of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Big5 is a &quot;de facto&quot; standard of Taiwan.

In contrast to the situation with Japanese, there has been relatively little overt opposition to Unicode, which solves many of the issues involved with GB and Big5. Unicode is widely regarded as politically neutral, has good support for both simplified and traditional characters, and can be easily converted to and from the GB and Big5. Furthermore, Unicode has the advantage of not being limited only to Chinese, since it contains character codes for (nearly) every language.

== Guobiao ==
The Guobiao (GB) line of character encodings start with the Simplified Chinese charset GB 2312 published in 1980. Two encoding schemes existed for GB 2312: a one-or-two byte 8-bit EUC-CN encoding commonly used, and a 7-bit encoding called HZ for usenet posts. A traditional variant called GB/T 12345 was published in 1990.

The EUC-CN form was later extended into GBK to include &quot;all&quot; Unicode 1.1 CJK Ideographs in 1993, abandoning the ISO-2022 model. By doing so, GBK includes traditional Chinese characters in addition to simplified ones in GB2312. GBK gained popularity through the widespread Code page 936 implementation found in Microsoft Windows 95.

In 2000, GB 18030 was published as GBK&#x27;s successor. This new encoding includes a four-byte UTF which encodes all Unicode codepoints not previously encoded. In 2005, GB 18030 was published to contain reference glyphs for scripts used by ethnic minorities in China, as well as glyphs from CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B due to the update of Unicode.

Adobe-GB1 is the corresponding PostScript charset for GB encodings.

== Big5 ==

The Big5 family of character encodings start with the initial definition by the consortium of five companies in Taiwan that developed it. It is a double-byte character set (DBCS) somehow similar to Shift JIS, often combined with a MBCS like ASCII. Quite a few vendors as well as official extensions exist, of which ETEN, HKSCS (Hong Kong) and Big5-2003 (as a part of CNS 11643 by Taiwan) are the most well-known ones. Adobe-CNS1 is the PostScript charset corresponding to the Big5 family of encodings.

== Conversion ==

Prior to GBK which includes both traditional and simplified characters, conversion between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese charsets was complicated by the need of transcribing text between the two variants of Chinese, as one charset cover many of the other&#x27;s characters only in its own variant. The conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese is usually problematic, because the simplification of some traditional forms merged two or more different characters into one simplified form. The traditional to simplified (many-to-one) conversion is technically simple. The opposite conversion often results in a data loss when converting to GB 2312: in mapping one-to-many when assigning traditional glyphs to the simplified glyphs, some characters will inevitably be the wrong choices in some of the usages. Thus simplified to traditional conversion often requires usage context or common phrase lists to resolve conflicts. This issue is less of a problem with newer standards such as GBK, GB 18030 and Unicode, which have separate code points for both simplified and traditional characters. 

One other issue is that many of the encoding systems are missing characters. While the missing characters are often literary and not commonly used in ordinary text, this does become a problem because people&#x27;s names often contain these characters. An example of the problem is the Taiwanese politician Wang Chien-shien who has a () character in his name which is not in some character systems, and former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji, whose () character is not in GB 2312. The newest GB standard, GB 18030 has the complete character repertoire of Unicode 4.0, including the Unihan extensions in the Supplementary Ideographic Plane.

<text>Egill&#x27;s Saga or Egil&#x27;s saga ( ; ) is an Icelandic saga (family saga) on the lives of the clan of Egill Skallagrímsson (Anglicised as Egill Skallagrimsson), an Icelandic farmer, viking and skald. The saga spans the years c. 850–1000 and traces the family&#x27;s history from Egill&#x27;s grandfather to his offspring.

Its oldest manuscript (a fragment) dates back to c. 1250 AD. The saga comprises the sole source of information on the exploits of Egill, whose life is not historically recorded. Stylistic and other similarities between &quot;Egill&#x27;s Saga&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot; have led many scholars to believe that they were the work of the same author, Snorri Sturluson. The work is generally referred to as Egla by Icelandic scholars.

==Synopsis==
The saga begins in Norway around 850, with the life of Egill&#x27;s grandfather Ulf (Úlfr) aka Kveldulf or &quot;Evening Wolf&quot;, and his two sons Thorolf (Þórólfr) and Skallagrim (Skalla-Grímr). Strife with the royal house drive the family out of the country, and they settle in Iceland. The brothers Egill and Thorolf Skallagrimsson are born. They have a tenuous tenure in Norway, but Egill is outlawed and they roam Scandinavia and serve the king of England. Egill tries to reclaim property back in Norway (as his wife&#x27;s inheritance), but this is blocked, and Egill develops a personal vendetta against the King.

There are also vivid descriptions of his other fights and friendships, his relationship with his family (highlighted by his jealousy, as well as fondness for his older brother Thorolf), his old age, and the fate of his own son Thorstein (Þorsteinn, who was baptized once Roman Catholicism came to Iceland) and his children, who had many children of their own. The saga ends around the year 1000 and spans many generations.

===Kveldulf&#x27;s lineage===
Ulf (Kveldulf) had Hallbjorn Halftroll as his maternal uncle, and was known for his surpassing size and strength. He had accrued land and property from viking raids, and was a man of wisdom. He earned the nickname Kveldulf (Kveldúlfr, &quot;Evening Wolf&quot;) because of his erratic temper at nightfall, and reputation for manifesting the so-called &quot;shape-shifter&quot; (&quot;hamrammr&quot;) abilities, explained in later chapters to be comparable (or equatable) with berserk fury. Extreme personal traits like these are manifested by his son Skallagrim and his grandson Egill as well.

===Strife with Harald Fairhair of Norway ===
King Harald Fairhair (Haraldr Hárfagri) was warring to unite all of Norway. Kveldulf refused to assist the local king of Fjordane, but rebuffed Harald&#x27;s overtures as well, incurring his wrath. A compromise was mediated by Olvir Hnufa (Ölvir hnúfa or &quot;Olvir Hump&quot;), Kveldulf&#x27;s brother-in-law and Harald&#x27;s court poet: Kveldulf was to send his elder son Thorolf, as soon as he returned from viking expedition. Thorolf served the king well, but suspicion fell on him due to his becoming overly successful, exacerbated by words of slanderers. Thorolf was killed by the king who led a band of warriors, and the rift would force Skallagrim and his father Kveldulf to flee Norway to settle in Iceland.

Skallagrim journeyed to Harald&#x27;s court seeking compensation for the death of his brother Thorolf, but offended the king and had to make a hasty exit empty-handed. Skallagrim and Kveldulf then recaptured a boat that had been seized from Thorolf, and after killing everyone on board, sent a taunting poem to the King. In the battle, Kveldulf displayed his &quot;frenzy&quot; (&quot;hamrammr&quot; or &quot;hamremi&quot;), which left him severely weakened. When the family emigrated to Iceland, Kveldulf did not survive the trip, and his coffin was set adrift. Near the spot where the coffin washed ashore in Iceland, Skallagrim established his settlement, which he named Borg. He took up a peaceful livelihood as a farmer and blacksmith, and raised his sons, Thorolf (named Þórólfr after his slain brother), and Egill (the titular hero).

=== Skallagrim&#x27;s sons===
The saga then proceeds to describe the lives of Thorolf and Egill Skallagrimsson, born in Iceland, and eventually making their way to Norway in adulthood. Thorolf visited Skallagrim&#x27;s old friend in Norway, Thorir the Hersir (Þórir Hróaldsson). Here Thorolf befriended Prince Eirik Bloodaxe, Harald&#x27;s favorite son and Thorir&#x27;s fosterling. He approached the prince with a gift of a painted warship that Eirik was admiring, on advice of Bjorn (Björn Brynjólfsson), Thorir&#x27;s brother-in-law.

Afterwards Eirik Bloodaxe was crowned co-king, and as Thorolf headed home to Iceland, the king gave him a gold-inlaid ax as a gift to Skallagrim. Skallagrim abused the ax (named &quot;King&#x27;s Gift&quot; or &quot;konungsnautr&quot;) and shattered it, reciting an insulting poem about it to Thorolf and handing back what was left of the axe, a sooty handle with a rusted blade. Thorolf flung the axe overboard, but reported to King Eirik that his father was grateful for the axe, presenting a bolt of longship sail cloth pretended to be from Skallagrim. In this way Thorolf managed to somewhat keep the peace between Skallagrim and King Eirik Bloodaxe.

Egill&#x27;s boyhood foreshadowed his future rebelliousness and poetic prowess. At the age of three, his unbridled behavior when drunk and strength beyond his age earned him a stay at home, ordered by his father, when a feast was held by Yngvar (Egill&#x27;s maternal grandfather). Egill defiantly rode a horse to attend, following his father and company from afar, and composed his first skaldic verse. At the age of seven while playing in the ball games (&quot;knattleikr&quot;), he committed his first murder (axe-killing an older boy who outclassed him in the sport). By the time Egill was twelve very few grown men could compete with him in games, but when he and his friend challenged his father one day, Skallagrim manifested such strength at nightfall that he slammed the friend dead against the ground. Egill&#x27;s life was only saved when Egill&#x27;s fostra (a female slave that had acted as Egill&#x27;s nurse as a child) tried to calm Skallagrim down and was killed instead. Egill got so upset that he killed one of his father&#x27;s favorite slaves in return, and as a result the two were not on speaking terms for the following winter.

===Conflict with Eirik Bloodaxe over ale===

The summer after Egill&#x27;s father killed his friend, Thorolf came home to visit Iceland. Egill forcibly insisted on accompanying Thorolf back to Norway, although Thorolf was reluctant. On this trip, Thorolf took his prospective wife, Asgerd (Ásgerðr Bjarnardóttir), who had been reared in Iceland, to ask her father Bjorn and uncle Thorir for permission to marry. While staying with Thorir, Egill became attached to Thorir&#x27;s son Arinbjorn (Arinbjörn Þórisson), an important figure in the saga and Egill&#x27;s lifelong friend.

Egill missed the wedding on account of illness, and joined Thorir&#x27;s men on an errand in Atloy, where he was slighted by the king&#x27;s steward Bard (Bárðr), and wound up killing him. When Bard received Egill&#x27;s party, he would only serve curd (skyr) to drink, pretending ale had run out. But later that night when king and queen arrived for the feast to the dísir, ale was served plentifully. Egill relentlessly jibed Bard about the deceit with sarcastic poetry, and his unquenchable thirst embarrassed the host. Bard and the queen sent Egill a poisoned drink, but the attempt was foiled by Egill, who inscribed runes on the horn and besmeared it with his own blood, causing the horn to shatter. Egill then went up to Bard and stabbed him to death with his sword. Discovering Egill had fled, Eirik ordered an unsuccessful manhunt to have Egill killed, and lost several men. Despite the affront, Eirik was persuaded by Thorir (his foster-father) to settle this by compensation.

===Mercenary service in England, Thorolf falls in battle===

While raiding near Frisia, Egill and Thorolf hear that King Æthelstan of England is in need of warriors. The brothers and their men sail to England to join the armies of the English king, are placed in charge of the Scandinavian contingent of Æthelstan&#x27;s forces. The saga here displays contact with English historical tradition, correctly providing Æthelstan&#x27;s lineage and offering only one of two instances of King Alfred being called &#x27;the Great&#x27; outside of English sources. The battle that follows the brothers&#x27; arrival in England, named Vínheiðr in the text, is widely accepted as being the same as the Battle of Brunanburh, from which Æthelstan emerged victorious in 937. The saga identifies the primary antagonist at Vínheiðr as &quot;Olaf the Red of Scotland&quot;, who appears to be a conflation of the Æthelstan&#x27;s historical opponents, Constantine II of Scotland and Olaf Guthfrithson, a Hiberno-Norse Uí Ímair dynast. Egill and Thorolf are instrumental in Æthelstan&#x27;s victory; however, Thorolf is killed on the second day of battle. In the aftermath of the conflict, Æthelstan gives Egill two chest of silver in compensation for Thorolf&#x27;s death, intending that they be passed on to Skallagrim. Egill, however, keeps the silver for himself along with an arm-ring that the king passes him at sword-point at the victory feast. Egill stays at Æthelstan&#x27;s court for the winter, during which time he composes a drápa in praise of the king. Æthelstan rewards Egill with yet two more gold arm-rings as well as an expensive cloak that the king himself had worn. At Egill&#x27;s parting, Æthelstan expresses a wish that he would stay permanently in his service, an offer which Egill declines.

===Inheritance case at the Gula-Thing===

Egill married his brother Thorolf&#x27;s widow, Asgerd. Some time later, Asgerd&#x27;s father Bjorn the Wealthy died in Norway, but she received no inheritance, the entire estate having been claimed by Berg-Onund, married to Gunnhild Bjarnardottir (Asgerd&#x27;s half-sister). Egill wanted to claim half-share for his wife, but the prospect was bleak because Berg-Onund was a favorite of Eirik and his consort Gunnhild. The case was argued at the Gulaþing assembly, where Berg-Onund asserted that Asgerd as a slave-woman entitled to no share (due to the circumstance that her mother eloped without her kinsmen&#x27;s consent). Asbjorn countered with witnesses swearing that Asgerd was acknowledged as heiress, but the processing was blocked by Queen Gunnhild who ordered a henchmen to disrupt the assembly. Egill made threat against anyone who tried to make use of the disputed farm, and fled by ship. Eirik pursued with a fleet, and a skirmish ensued.

===Eirik&#x27;s power, cursed by Egill===

Harald Fairhair dies, and Eirik becomes King of Norway, eliminating two of his brothers who were rivals to the crown. Eirik declares Egill an outlaw to be killed on sight, and Egill vows vengeance, especially against the manipulative queen. Egill&#x27;s movements are under surveillance, and when he appears to leave the country, Berg-Onund dismissed the men he had gathered for protection and traveled not far from his home (Ask) to the king&#x27;s farm at Aarstad. By chance, calm winds force Egill back to shore to the same location. Egill commits massacre, killing Onund, as well as Eirik&#x27;s 10 year-old prince Rognvald. To top it off, Egill erects a scorn-pole (Nithing pole) with a horse head mounted on top, laying a curse that the nature spirits drive King Eirik and Queen Gunnhild away from Norway. The hoped-for outcome of the curse does become reality.

The saga makes note of the death of Skallagrim, Egill&#x27;s father.

===Head-Ransom===

Eirik ruled just 1 year before being ousted as Norwegian king by his brother Hakon the fosterling of King Æthelstan in England. Eirik left Norway with his family, and eventually appointed king over Northumbria by Æthelstan of England. Two years later, Egill sailed to England intending to see Æthelstan and was captured by Eirik Bloodaxe. Eirik was furious, but Arinbjorn Thorisson convinced Eirik to spare Egill&#x27;s life if he could compose a poem in his honor. Egill succeeded (by reciting &quot;Höfuðlausn&quot; or &quot;Head Ransom&quot;), and Eirik allowed him to leave on condition that he never appeared again before Eirik&#x27;s sight. Egill made his way to see King Æthelstan, who was fostering Thorstein (Þorsteinn), a kinsman of Arinbjorn. While visiting, word arrived from Norway that Thorstein&#x27;s father died leaving him a large inheritance. Þorsteinn, Arinbjorn and Egill made plans to sail to Norway to claim Thorsteinn&#x27;s share. Before they leave, King Æthelstan convinced Egill to move to England and command his armies after their task is completed.

Egill returned to Iceland and spent a few years with his family. During this time, both Kings Æthelstan and Eirik Bloodaxe died, leaving Eirik&#x27;s brother Hakon ruler of Norway. Egill returned to Norway to claim lands won in a duel with Atli the Short on behalf of his wife Asgerd. Along the way Egill stayed with Arinbjorn, whom he convinces to go to King Hákon on his behalf. Hákon denied Egill&#x27;s claim, so Arinbjorn compensated Egill with forty marks of silver.

Egill and Arinbjörn went raiding in Saxony and Frisia, after which they stayed with Thorstein Thoruson (Þorsteinn Þóruson). King Hakon requested Thorstein to collect tribute in Värmland or be sentenced to outlawry. Egill went in Thorsteinn&#x27;s place. Egill traveled with some of King Hákon&#x27;s men to Värmland and fought battles, Egill killing many times more foes than his companions.

Egill lived to be an old age. Arinbjörn became a close advisor to Harald Eiríksson, to whom Egill composed a poem. Egill&#x27;s son Bodvar (Böðvar) died in a shipwreck. Egill composed a poem in his honor. Egill&#x27;s son Thorsteinn has many feuds with Steinar, son of Onund Sjoni (Önundr sjóni Ánason), over land and cattle grazing. Egill became frail and blind. His one last wish was to travel to the Althing and toss silver he received from King Æthelstan for the people to fight over. When he was denied this, he commanded two enslaved men to help him conceal his silver treasure. After this act, he killed the two men to conceal the location and to punish his son-in-law. near Mosfellsbær, giving birth to the legend of &quot;Silfur Egils&quot; (&quot;Egill&#x27;s Silver&quot;).

==Interpretation==

The character of Egill is complex and full of seeming contradictions. His multifaceted nature reflects the extreme qualities of his family, a family of men who are either ugly or astoundingly handsome; a family which includes &#x27;shape-shifters&#x27;, who become suddenly mad, violent and cruel, though they may at other times be deliberate and wise; a family which neither submits to the will of kings, nor stands in open rebellion. His character is also reflected in the storytelling conventions of the text, a difficult text populated by characters with similar or identical names, living out various permutations of very similar stories. The two handsome Thorolfs (Þórólfs) die heroic deaths, while their brothers Skallagrim and Egill both die in old age after spitefully burying their wealth in the wilderness. The descendants of Kveldúlfr find themselves involved in two complicated inheritance feuds, at one time rejecting the claims of illegitimate children of a second marriage, and at another time claiming land on behalf of another illegitimate child born to similar circumstances.

At times in &quot;Egill&#x27;s saga&quot; Egill comes across as a brute who often acts quickly and irrationally for no reason. He appears to be a shallow creature and in many instances the only time he appears to put much thought into anything is when he composes and recites poetry. Egill is in reality a man of many virtues which are central to his character. He values honor, loyalty, respect, and friendship above all other things. He takes it as a great personal insult when someone breaks any of these values and as a result he typically destroys that person either through physical force or through poetry. His reactions are usually on a grand scale to the point where they are often outrageous and entertaining. The value code by which Egill lived was the same as that of many Scandinavians at the time of the story&#x27;s composition. The story is set in a time when many people were migrating, most notably from Norway to Iceland. Life was harsh, particularly during the long, cold winters, when it was crucial for people to get along and work together.

Poetry is used throughout most of the saga and Egill is a master of the art. &quot;Egill&#x27;s Saga&quot; takes place during a time of oral tradition. Poetry was used to establish a person&#x27;s reputation for good or evil, and a great poem could make its characters immortal. Rulers valued poets for their ability to make or break a man, increasing his fame or besmirching his good name. As a poet, Egill was a powerful and valued man.

One of the first negative poems in &quot;Egill&#x27;s saga&quot; is a threatening poem in chapter 27 that displays Skallagrim&#x27;s power after he had just plundered a ship and killed many men. Later, in chapter 38, Skallagrim composes an insulting poem about King Eirik after the king had given Skallagrim a gift not commensurate with his worth. In chapters 55 and 81, Egill composes two powerful poems that show how grief-stricken he is when his brother Thorolfr and his son Bodvar die. These poems are also meant to honor the two. These are only a few examples of the many poems in the saga which portray people in a positive or negative light.

There are also poems which show a much softer side to the Icelandic male characters. One of these is in chapter 55 when King Æthelstan acknowledges the death of Egill&#x27;s brother, Thorolfr, caused by the King&#x27;s error in judgement. Egill thanks the king with a number of praise poems showing how considerate and generous the king is. We see a very different side of Egill in chapter 56 when he declares his secret love for his future wife, in a love poem. In chapters 60–62, Egill is confronted with a situation where he must greet King Eirik, with whom he is on bad terms. King Eirik wants Egill dead and at the urging of his friend Arinbjorn, Egill composes a drápa (one of the most complicated forms of poetry) of 20 stanzas praising the king. Thanks to the poem, named Höfuðlausn (Head-Ransom) Egill is allowed to leave Eiríkr&#x27;s court alive, since killing him would make Eiríkr look like a fool. In chapter 80, Egill composes another praise poem of 25 stanzas expressing his gratitude towards his lifelong friend Arinbjörn for saving his life in his meeting with King Eiríkr. These more positive poems show us a kinder side to the typically rough and violent people of &quot;Egill&#x27;s saga&quot;.

As a work of literature, &quot;Egill&#x27;s Saga&quot; is generally considered to be amongst the best of the Icelandic sagas, along with &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, &quot;Gísla saga Súrssonar&quot;, and &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot;.

<text>A Medal for Benny is a 1945 American drama film directed by Irving Pichel. The story was conceived by writer Jack Wagner, who enlisted his long-time friend John Steinbeck to help him put it into script form. The film was released by Paramount Pictures. The film is also known as &quot;Benny&#x27;s Medal&quot;.

==Plot==
Benny Martin leaves his small town of Pantera and joins the Army after getting in trouble with the police. While he is away, his girlfriend (Lolita) is romanced by Joe. Although she has not heard from Benny in months, she refuses Joe’s advances, wanting to stay loyal to Benny. She eventually falls for Joe and agrees to marry him but then finds out that Benny was killed in action and has been awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. Meanwhile, the Pantera mayor plans a rally for the medal presentation to Benny’s father and intends to use a beautiful house for the event so as not to embarrass the town by having the medal presented at the modest Martin residence. However, Benny’s father Charley, refuses to go along with the ruse and instead the medal ceremony takes place at his home. In his speech, Charley says that Benny will live on in his and Lolita&#x27;s hearts. Lolita then tells Joe that she cannot marry him yet, because it might break Charley&#x27;s heart.

<text>The black-winged stilt (Himantopus himantopus) is a widely distributed, very long-legged wader in the avocet and stilt family Recurvirostridae. Its scientific name, &quot;Himantopus himantopus&quot;, is sometimes used to generalize a single, almost cosmopolitan species. Alternatively, it is restricted to the form that is widespread in Europe, Asia and Africa, which equals the nominate group of &quot;H. himantopus&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot;. Meanwhile, the black-necked (&quot;H. mexicanus&quot;) and white-backed stilts (&quot;H. melanurus&quot;) both inhabit the Americas; the pied stilt (&quot;H. leucocephalus&quot;) ranges from Australasia and New Zealand. Today, most sources accept between one and four actual species.

==Taxonomy==
The black-winged stilt was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the plovers in the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Charadrius himantopus&quot;. He specified the type locality as southern Europe. The taxonomic name &quot;Himantopus&quot; comes from Greek, meaning &quot;strap-foot&quot; or &quot;thong-foot&quot;. The black-winged stilt is now one of five species placed in the genus &quot;Himantopus&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The taxonomy of this bird is still somewhat contentious; it is one of four distinct species, which sometimes are considered subspecies of &quot;H. himantopus&quot;. &quot;H. himantopus&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot; is made up of a single species, with 5–7 subspecies, and is sometimes referred to as the common stilt. The name &quot;black-winged stilt&quot; refers to &quot;H. himantopus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, with two subspecies (&quot;H.h. himantopus&quot; from the Palearctic to South Asia, and &quot;H.h. meridionalis&quot; from the Afrotropical region).

==Description==
Adults are long, with long, pink legs, and a long, rather thin black bill. The birds are generally black above and white below, with a white head and neck (with a varying amount of black, species-dependent). Males have a black back, often with a greenish gloss or sheen. Females&#x27; backs have a brownish hue, contrasting with the black remiges. In populations where the top of the head is normally white (at least in winter), females tend to have less black on the head and neck the entire year-round, while males often have much more black, particularly in summer. This difference is not clear-cut, however, and males usually grow all-white head feathers in winter.

Immature birds are grey, instead of black, and have a markedly sandy hue on their wings, with light feather fringes appearing as a whitish line in flight.

==Ecology and status==
The breeding habitat of all these stilts is marshes, shallow lakes and ponds. Some populations are migratory and move to the ocean coasts in winter; those in warmer regions are generally resident or short-range vagrants. In Europe, the black-winged stilt is a regular spring overshoot vagrant north of its normal range, occasionally remaining to breed in northern European countries. Pairs successfully bred in Britain in 1987, and after a 27-year hiatus there were two instances of successful breeding in Southern England in 2014. 13 young were fledged in southern England in 2017. Four chicks were successfully fledged in northern England in 2022; this is believed to be the most northerly breeding success for the black-winged stilt.

These birds pick up their food from sand or water. They eat mainly insects and crustaceans.

The nest site is a bare spot on the ground near water. These birds often nest in small groups, sometimes with avocets.

The black-winged stilt is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; applies.

<text>Gordon Giltrap, MBE (born 6 April 1948) is an English guitarist and composer. His music crosses several genres. He has been described as &quot;one of the most revered guitarists of his generation&quot;, and has drawn praise from fellow musicians including Steve Rothery, Ritchie Blackmore and Jimmy Page.

==Early life==
Giltrap was born on 6 April 1948 in the village of Brenchley, Kent, England at The British Hospital for Mothers and Babies. Thereafter he was brought up in Deptford, South East London spending the first 11 years of his life at 43 Elverson Road, a two up, two down terraced house shared by two households with an outside toilet. His family then moved to Blackwall Lane East Greenwich. Rock star Marty Wilde grew up in the same area along with guitarist Albert Lee. Giltrap began to play the guitar at the age of 12 and received no formal tuition, choosing to develop his own style and technique.

==Career==
Giltrap&#x27;s career began in the 1960s performing in the folk music scene in London alongside contemporaries such as Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, and Mike Oldfield. At 18, Giltrap signed with Transatlantic Records and released his debut studio albums, &quot;Gordon Giltrap&quot; (1968) and &quot;Portrait&quot; (1969). Both featured Giltrap on guitar and lead vocals; he has since considered his lyrics &quot;naive&quot;. The track &quot;Willow Pattern&quot; from his debut attracted the praise of guitarist Ralph McTell for the imagery it portrayed. &quot;Gospel Song&quot;, also from his first, features a more aggressive strumming style, influenced by Pete Townshend, which later became a trademark of his style. In 1969, Giltrap was featured in Transatlantic&#x27;s guitar showcase album &quot;The Contemporary Guitar Sampler, Volume 1&quot;. He was also featured on the second volume released in 1970, and both increased his profile.

Shortly after the release of his first album, Giltrap joined The Buskers&#x27; Tour of the UK, headlined by Don Partridge. Giltrap subsequently formed a band with Partridge called Accolade. Together they released a self-titled album. Partridge later wrote the sleeve notes for &quot;Portrait&quot;. Giltrap played lead guitar in the band and penned several compositions. Whilst his involvement in the band certainly helped to raise his profile he felt impatient to move on to recording further new albums under his own name.

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Giltrap signed to MCA Records and released his next album, &quot;Testament of Time&quot;, which was again a mixture of songs and instrumental pieces. on two future albums. It was to be one of the pieces he chose to play on his first television appearance, on &quot;Disco 2&quot;.

At this stage, he was managed by Miles Copeland who, amongst others, also managed Wishbone Ash. Strings on the album were arranged by Del Newman, who also played keyboards. Newman had already worked with many artists of that era including Cat Stevens. Thus began a lasting friendship, and later Giltrap wrote the foreword for Newman&#x27;s 2010 autobiography &quot;A Touch From God (It&#x27;s Only Rock and Roll)&quot;. With Newman&#x27;s influence, the album had a much fuller sound than Giltrap&#x27;s previous two albums and he regarded it as a significant step forward.

His association with Copeland ended when he moved to Philips Records, releasing the 1973 album entitled &quot;Giltrap&quot;. This album featured a much larger band. On some of the songs he experimented with early instruments (played by Douglas Wooton and Rod and Joseph Sleeping) and some of his lyrics clearly reflected an interest in historical events. The drummer on this album was Nicko McBrain, who a decade later would join Iron Maiden. The front cover photographs reflect Giltrap as a proud father blowing bubbles together with his then two-year-old son, Jamie. The opening track, &quot;When I See My Son&quot;, further reflected that pride. This was the last album on which he sang lead vocals. As he became less convinced by his lyric writing capabilities he began seeking a different path.

While popular on the folk and university circuit, Giltrap reached a turning point and received greater recognition during the 1970s. During this time, Giltrap started to concentrate on more purely instrumental pieces, and in 1976 released the album &quot;Visionary&quot;, based on the art and poetry of William Blake. Whilst recording, he missed the birth of his daughter Sadie, who was born in March 1975.

&quot;Visionary&quot; was produced by Jon Miller, who along with guitarist Roger Hand and keyboard player Rod Edwards were known as Triumvirate Productions. Hand and Edwards, having listened to demos of some of the material for &quot;Visionary&quot;, decided that it was time for Giltrap to be dragged, initially reluctantly, into the realm of rock music. With this new sound, however, Giltrap found a different audience and gained greater commercial success. The success of this album prompted Giltrap to move on from the singer-songwriter approach and to form the Gordon Giltrap Band, which toured extensively in the UK at that time.

Once the demos for &quot;Visionary&quot; were finished, Giltrap found himself with a three-album record contract with Electric Records. He was then offered a UK tour supporting the English progressive rock band Renaissance. He was invited to appear on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; hosted by Bob Harris. Supported by his full band, they performed &quot;Robes and Crowns/Awakening&quot; and &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Cage&quot;. Footage of the latter performance can be seen on the program &#x27;Guitar Heroes at the BBC&#x27;.

A European tour followed at the end of 1976 as a support act to Wishbone Ash. They played several dates in Germany and were also booked to tour Switzerland. Unfortunately, upon arriving in Zurich Giltrap was hit by a car and broke his collarbone. As he was then unable to play guitar ,the rest of his tour was cancelled.

His follow-up album, &quot;Perilous Journey&quot;, consolidated his success, being named one of the best albums of 1977 by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. It peaked in the UK Albums Chart at No. 29. A single taken from the album, &quot;Heartsong&quot;, received extensive airplay and reached No. 21 in the UK Singles Chart. The track was later used as the theme tune of the BBC TV series &quot;Holiday&quot;. Another of Giltrap&#x27;s tracks, &quot;The Carnival&quot;, was specially commissioned by ITV for the theme tune to ITV&#x27;s holiday programme &quot;Wish You Were Here...?&quot;.

&quot;Heartsong&quot; has subsequently become the tune for which Giltrap is best known and still features in his live sets. &quot;Heartsong&quot; was eventually nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for the best instrumental/ orchestral piece for that year, losing to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Song for Guy&quot;. Giltrap later said of the track&#x27;s creation, &quot;It began with a song I did in the late &#x27;60s called &#x27;Starting All Over&#x27;. When I lived in London I began to mess around with it and stumbled on the riff for what would become &#x27;Heartsong&#x27;. I kept working on it, and eventually recorded the guitar part for it. Then we added the rhythm section from Simon Phillips (drums) and John G. Perry (bass).&quot;
&quot;At the time I never thought of this as anything other than a jolly little tune, but my producers Rod Edwards and Roger Hand realized the commercial potential in what we had. The melody really came out when the mini moog part was added, and then Eddie Spence (keyboards) came up with the fast moving synth figure. Edwards and Hand recorded Eddie at half speed, then played it back at normal speed to get the desired effect. That was something they learnt from working with George Martin.&quot;

Whilst &quot;Visionary&quot; had evolved from acoustic compositions adapted for a bigger band, &quot;Perilous Journey&quot; was composed with a bigger band sound in mind. It appeared occasionally to be more keyboard dominated but Giltrap was unperturbed by this as the pieces were his own compositions and he was pleased with the arrangements which he had worked on with Rod Edwards and Roger Hand.

In this period, albums had to flow from artists at consistent rates and few acts dared to allow time for the public to forget them. Such was the case with Giltrap who released his next album, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, in 1978. At this stage, after the success of his previous two albums, Giltrap was riding on a high. Material for &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; was relatively swiftly assembled.

The title track, in shortened form, was released as a single but failed to match the commercial success of &quot;Heartsong&quot;. It reached number 48 in the singles charts and the band appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Another song on the album, &quot;Fast Approaching&quot;, was a reworked track, vastly different from the original which had appeared on Giltrap&#x27;s first album. It was extended to five minutes and featured Giltrap on both acoustic and electric guitars. He was now becoming far more familiar with the latter instrument and at this stage really enjoyed playing his Gibson Les Paul. Giltrap&#x27;s electric guitar playing is a feature on this album but he was always first and foremost an acoustic guitarist and before too long the electric guitar featured less and less in his work.

In 1979, Giltrap toured the &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; album with a band that consisted of John Gustafson on bass, who was active in the early Mersey scene and a top session player, and Ian Mosley on drums, who went on to work with Steve Hackett and latterly became a full-time member of Marillion. Old stalwarts Rod Edwards and Eddy Spence shared keyboard duties. Singer Shirlie Roden made a guest appearance on &#x27;&quot;Innerdream&quot;. One of the dates on the tour was at the Oxford Polytechnic, where the subsequent &quot;Live at Oxford&quot; album was recorded.

By this stage in Giltrap&#x27;s career, he was beginning to be concerned about becoming too predictable. He decided to move away from playing with a band and move back towards solo work. Giltrap&#x27;s next album &quot;The Peacock Party&quot; which was released in 1979, was inspired by a book of the same name. This was in part illustrated by Alan Aldridge who also painted the colourful cover of the Giltrap album. A previous book entitled &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot; had inspired an album by Roger Glover of Deep Purple which featured a host of stars. The Triumvirate team had also been working on an album inspired by the book featuring the voices of Judi Dench and Michael Hordern and it also featured celebrated musicians including Gerry Conway and Bruce Lynch both of whom had previously worked extensively with Cat Stevens. Aldridge appeared to prefer Triumvirates&#x27;s version and it was he who brought his next book &quot;The Peacock Party&quot;  to the Triumvirate team to see if they were interested in another project. Triumvirate felt this was a good project for Giltrap to pursue.

Giltrap&#x27;s pieces on this album are less complicated but still feature a full band sound. The whole feel of the album is more upbeat than his previous three. The tracks are shorter in length and, ironically, feature Giltrap playing more electric guitar than previous albums.

As previously mentioned, Giltrap had decided at this stage to move away from more commercial music and concentrate solely upon self-penned intricate guitar pieces. Whilst working on &quot;The Peacock Party&quot; he decided to retain the big band sound and incorporated many musicians within his pieces with whom he felt comfortable working. For example, the album featured the first of Giltrap&#x27;s several collaborations with violinist Ric Sanders of Fairport Convention and John Etheridge of Soft Machine also features.

This album showcased Giltrap&#x27;s talents from his strident electric guitar work on the opening track, &quot;Headwind&quot; to the intricacy of second acoustic track &quot;Magpie Rag&quot;. This track incorporates a complex, oft-repeated riff around which the whole piece is based. The final track, &quot;Dodo&#x27;s Dream&quot; has become a standard feature of his live performances in which he uses a looper and overdubbing to build up the piece.

When he finished recording, he embarked on a small tour in his favoured trio format which featured Ric Sanders on violin and long-term ally Eddie Spence on keyboards. This diversion concluded at a tricky time in his life when his first marriage broke up and his mother, with whom he was very close, died at age 58 having contracted cancer .

The tour to promote the album comprised Giltrap, Clive Bunker on drums, Rod Edwards on keyboards and &#x27;Bimbo&#x27; Acock on saxophone, flute and additional keyboards. The tour was a success and boosted Giltrap at a time when he was feeling really low.

=== 1980s ===
Giltrap&#x27;s next album, &quot;Airwaves&quot;, released in 1981, evolved from the lineup of the band with whom Giltrap was performing. This was a different album to any previously produced as Giltrap did not compose every piece. Initially planned as music for TV, radio, film or other non-commercial use the recordings gradually morphed into an album which was eventually released. It didn&#x27;t sell as well as previous Giltrap recordings and Giltrap himself felt somewhat detached from it as he was going through a difficult time in his life. There were to be no more Giltrap albums released for five years.

Performing gigs, however, did not stop as income still needed to be earned and Giltrap was pleased that he had learnt his craft as a solo performer thus not requiring the backing of a large band. During this time, he honed his skills of engaging with an audience.

Giltrap&#x27;s life during this time went through a turbulent stage with the loss of his father at age 66, the fact he had two children to bring up and meeting Hilary, who was to become his second wife. He gradually began to get his life back to some sort of order. He was also gigging through this entire time and had joined up with Ric Sanders, the violinist of Fairport Convention. Sanders had already appeared as a guest on Giltrap&#x27;s&#x27; album &quot;Peacock Party&quot;.

The title track, the longest on the album, was based upon a poem written by Elizabeth Barker, Giltrap&#x27;s mother-in-law. Giltrap found the poem emotionally moving. On this track, the sound effects generated by the electric guitar are much in evidence.

&quot;Sallie&#x27;s Song&quot; was inspired by a commission Giltrap received for the TV series &quot;Hold the Back Page&quot; starring David Warner and directed by Adrian Shergold. Shergold later commissioned Giltrap to write music for several further productions. These compositions were never released on album because Giltrap felt they were too intrinsically linked to the plot of the films to work as stand-alone pieces.

Later in 1987, Giltrap released &quot;A Midnight Clear&quot;, featuring instrumental renditions of well-known and lesser-known Christmas carols. Giltrap enlisted the support of Ric Sanders and his old friend Bimbo Acock.

The following year, Giltrap began to performs at gigs with Sanders and the two men began working on an album together. Entitled &quot;One to One&quot;, it was released in 1989. Both artists felt differently about it but both accept there was an instrumental imbalance which could be substantially improved with a remix.

=== 1990s ===
In 1992, Giltrap performed at the Warwick Folk Festival when he performed, arguably, his finest live session. Unbeknownst to Giltrap, this was recorded and later released as an album. It was this album which caught the attention of Ritchie Blackmore, who had become a self-professed admirer of Giltrap&#x27;s work.

In 1993, Giltrap was able to complete a project he had contemplated for some time. He wished to re-record &quot;Heartsong&quot; with famous friends Brian May, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman, Midge Ure and Neil Murray. When completed there was little interest from record companies and it was two years before the track surfaced on an album.

Later that year, Giltrap joined Midge Ure on his Out Alone solo tour. Giltrap co-wrote a song with him entitled &quot;Feel So Good&quot; which was eventually released on the 2001 album &quot;Little Orphans&quot;. He also undertook a tour with a guitarist he greatly admired, Albert Lee, along with his band Hogan&#x27;s Heroes.

In 1994, Giltrap toured with ELO Part II. a group created by ELO drummer Bev Bevan without the involvement of Jeff Lynne. Giltrap was disappointed that his name did not appear on any advertising poster, nor was he actually remunerated for his performances. These were very well received and resulted in good CD sales.

Giltrap had used a Fylde guitar on &quot;Heartsong&quot; which had been greatly admired by Cliff Richard. This guitar is the one he played on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Whilst interviewing many musicians for &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine, Giltrap met Cliff Richard for the first time since the 1970s when he had originally loaned Richard the Fylde. It had an intricately designed inlay of the &#x27;Tree of Life&#x27; on the fretboard and Richard loved it. Giltrap decided to present it to him as a gift.

In 1995, Giltrap released the album &quot;Music for the Small Screen&quot;. Not many of these pieces, composed as the theme tunes for television programmes, had appeared on his albums. The album featured the all-star reworking of &quot;Heartsong&quot; and also a track entitled &quot;Last of England&quot;, later to be the title of a highly regarded album, which had been used in the Adrian Shergold drama &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;. This play was loosely based on the actions of child killer Mary Bell and featured Giltrap in a cameo role as a newspaper seller strumming a guitar.

This album also featured a track entitled &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Seat&quot; which had been written for a television documentary. It still remains a staple of Giltrap gigs. The track was written in a Renaissance style and required a special, lute-like baby guitar made by luthier Rob Armstrong. Another track on the album, &quot;Brutus&quot;, had been used as the theme tune of the World Bowls Championship.

In 1995, Giltrap was invited by Cliff Richard to take part in his West End musical &quot;Heathcliff&quot;, which was based upon the &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; novel by Charlotte Brontë. Giltrap&#x27;s character in the show was the Troubadour. He sang three songs in the show.

After some public previews at Earls Court, &quot;Heathcliff&quot; premiered at the National Indoor Theatre in Birmingham in October 1996. The show then headed to Edinburgh Playhouse for a four-week run before returning to Birmingham for a few pre-Christmas shows. It then travelled to the Palace Theatre in Manchester and finally Hammersmith Odeon before its final performance there in May 1997. &quot;Heathcliff&quot; reached an audience of nearly half a million people during its run and broke box-office records at almost every theatre at which the production was staged. Whilst not popular with critics, a video of the show recorded at Hammersmith Odeon remained top of the video charts for eight weeks.

Giltrap&#x27;s next album, &quot;Troubadour&quot;, was named after his character in &quot;Heathcliff&quot;. &quot;Troubadour&quot; gave Giltrap the chance to approach his old friend Del Newman to work on the string arrangements for the album. Newman wanted to produce the album himself to ensure the right balance between his string arrangements and Giltrap&#x27;s guitar.

When he heard that the album was going to include a version of &quot;A Misunderstood Man&quot;, Cliff Richard approached Giltrap and volunteered to sing backing vocals on the track. &quot;Troubadour&quot; also includes another song from the &quot;Heathcliff&quot; musical: &quot;Be With Me Always&quot;. The first edition of the album included sleeve notes written by both Cliff Richard and Tim Rice. An important album for Giltrap, many of its tracks are frequently included in his live performances to this day.

One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Rain in the Doorway&quot;, utilised a beloved baby guitar purchased at a boot sale for £5. It has since been renovated and usually accompanies Giltrap on his gigs, used primarily for the piece &quot;Appalachian Dreaming&quot;. The album gained very favourable reviews and sold well.

Alongside his continued live performances, Giltrap then began conducting celebrity interviews for &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine. This led to him meeting Fay Goodman, who was considering producing a series of DVD interviews with prominent musicians. Once employed, Giltrap found himself interviewing stars such as Albert Lee and Tony Iommi. One such interview was with one of his heroes, John Entwistle of the Who. Their encounter was later released as a DVD entitled &quot;Thunderfingers&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
For some time, Giltrap had been considering creating a tribute album to Bert Jansch, whom he greatly admired. The result was an album comprising six pieces. One of these tracks required vocals which Giltrap himself performed. The track, entitled &#x27;Running From Home&#x27;, was the first time Giltrap had sung on an album in 17 years.

During this album, Giltrap attempted to demonstrate Jansch&#x27;s great versatility of skills in the selection of pieces he chose for the album, performing each in Janch&#x27;s unique style. This is amply demonstrated by Ewan MacColl&#x27;s &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, a track which Jansch had played in his unique style and which Giltrap followed faithfully in his interpretation of the song. Another notable track on the album was another piece previously interpreted by Jansch: Davey Graham&#x27;s &quot;Anji&quot;. This piece (spelt &quot;Angie&quot; on the album) had also influenced Giltrap&#x27;s early work.

The album concluded with a version of &quot;Roots&quot;, Giltrap&#x27;s own composition which had first appeared on his &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; album. He included this to show the influence Jansch had had on his own guitar style.

&quot;Janschology&quot; was released on the &#x27;Voiceprint&#x27; label in 2001. Giltrap was by now working on new material for his next album, &quot;Under This Blue Sky&quot;, which was to be released the following year. Giltrap recruited additional musicians to play on the album, the most significant of whom was Bert Jansch himself. Jansch plays on the track &quot;Chambertin&quot;. This track had appeared on his previous album but was now considerably lengthened. The album also featured the talents of flautist Hillary Ashe-Roy.

Giltrap decided to include his version of George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. He used a baby Armstrong guitar for this piece and, although he never met George Harrison, he was indirectly the person who introduced him to that guitar. This happened via his friend, Joe Brown, who was so impressed with the instrument when Giltrap demonstrated it to him, that he sent one to Harrison as a Christmas present. Harrison loved it too and purchased two more as gifts for his close friends.

Another track revisited on this album was the &quot;Troubadour&quot; piece &quot;The Picnic&quot;. This piece became enlivened by Ashe-Roy&#x27;s skills on the flute and Giltrap was delighted with the result. The flautist&#x27;s skills were also in evidence on another track, &quot;Crossing the Border&quot;, on which the duo were joined by a second guitarist, Kevin Dempsey, with whom Giltrap had toured as a duo several years earlier.

In 2003, the album &quot;Remember This&quot; was released. Featuring some original Giltrap recordings, it mostly contains renditions of compositions which influenced the young Giltrap. These included &quot;Substitute&quot; by the Who, as Giltrap had long been an admirer of Pete Townshend&#x27;s skills on the guitar. The album also includes Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;, as well as pieces by Django Reinhardt, John Renbourn and J.S. Bach.

Giltrap performed most pieces himself but on a couple of tracks he enlisted the help of guitarist Neville Marten and, once again, the flautist Hilary Ashe-Roy. Two of Giltrap’s original tracks featured accompaniment by Rick Wakeman as these had previously been recorded for a radio programme.

In 2001, Giltrap met the classical guitarist Raymond Burley. Burley listened to Giltrap‘s work and, liking what he heard, realised that they might be able to make music together. This resulted in a collaborative album called &quot;Double Vision&quot;, which was released in 2004. The album was recorded live at Holy Trinity church in Weston, East Hampshire. This was the beginning of a collaboration between the two friends which would last several years.

Next came the solo album &quot;Live At Ambergate&quot;. This album explored the unusual sound effects of binaural recording which was recorded using in-ear microphones.

The next studio album, &quot;Drifter&quot;, was released in 2004. This featured a very special violin played by John Bradbury. This violin Giltrap had picked up at a boot fair for £20. He asked somebody to look at it to see if it was any good. It turned out to be a violin made by Giuseppe Pedrazzini who was a celebrated early 20th century violin maker, and was worth £30,000, This instrument was used on three tracks on the album. Giltrap eventually parted with the violin for £23,000.

The violin features on the opening track of the album, &quot;Mrs Singer&#x27;s Waltz&quot;. This is followed by another track, a regular piece in Giltrap&#x27;s current live performances, entitled &quot;Maddie Goes West&quot;. It features banjo player Madelyn Martyn who was just about to take a trip to America, hence the title.

The title track, &quot;Drifter&quot;, was, interestingly, also recorded on another guitar purchased cheaply at a boot fair. Giltrap&#x27;s wife, Hilary, helped out with the vocals on this track.

Giltrap had previously received a call from somebody who worked for music publishing company wondering if he could write a piece in the style of Django Reinhardt. Giltrap duly created a piece entitled &quot;Deco Echo&quot;. This piece was later to be used on a television programme about the &quot;Poirot&quot; series which starred David Suchet.

The album had a sleeve with the lone silhouetted figure of Giltrap looking like a drifter. The photo had been taken by his wife Hilary and they were both delighted with it particularly when they realised that it suited the title of the album perfectly.

No further original Giltrap albums were to be forthcoming for several years but in 2006 a concert at the Symphony Hall Birmingham was filmed.

In 2007, Giltrap released the album &quot;Secret Valentine&quot;. This album re-visited some of his favourite romantic pieces. It was basically created to feature the sound of a Rob Armstrong guitar which had been designed as part of a research project and was made entirely out of a plastic polymer. Giltrap released this and amply demonstrated the versatility of that instrument.

A live album, &quot;As It Happens...&quot;, was released later in 2007, with which Giltrap himself was very pleased.

The following year saw the launch of a venture entitled Three Parts Guitar. &quot;Double Vision&quot; had not been as successful as hoped due to a perceived clash in styles between Burley and Giltrap. The pair, however, convinced their collaboration had a future, enlisted the talented jazz-based guitarist John Etheridge to join them in a tour. This proved extremely successful. In concert, they each played a solo session before the finale where they joined together to play some of Gordon&#x27;s pieces. The show in the Symphony Hall in Birmingham in September 2008 was performed to capacity crowd with special guest Rick Wakeman.

John Etheridge could not totally commit to the tour as he was also working with classical guitar star John Williams. Clive Carrol was approached to see if he would step in if required. Having seen Carrol play guitar Festival, it was John Renbourn who recommended him. Giltrap too was also hugely impressed with his talent. Etheridge, however, then committed to the project and Carrol was asked to join the group which then became Four Parts Guitar, thus forming a collaboration which worked well for several more years.

For some time, Giltrap and Rick Wakeman had been planning to make an album together. They decided that the time had now arrived. Giltrap&#x27;s love of Renaissance art contrasting with Wakeman‘s love of sculpture resulted in the album&#x27;s title &quot;From Brush and Stone&quot;. The album, divided in two by composer, featured tracks with each adding accompaniment to each other&#x27;s compositions. Giltrap&#x27;s pieces were mainly a reworking of his &quot;Brotherhood Suite&quot; and these were complemented by versions of the aforementioned &quot;Maddie Goes West&quot; and a piece entitled &quot;By Angle Tarn&quot;.

The duo&#x27;s collaboration continued when Wakeman undertook a solo tour entitled Grumpy Old Picture Show. It included a previously recorded video conversation with Giltrap, which was worked so that Wakeman appeared to be conversing live with Giltrap on stage.  

=== 2010s ===
Wakeman also appeared on Giltrap’s next album, &quot;Shining Morn&quot;, which was released in 2010. The title piece appears twice on the album, first as a solo and again as the concluding track which incorporates Wakeman on keyboards. The flautist Hilary Ash-Roy appears once again on &quot;Joy Ride&quot; and &quot;Prayer for Philippa&quot;. Another track, &quot;Forever Gold&quot;, was written to celebrate Cliff Richard&#x27;s 50 years in show business.

Several older compositions are revisited on the album. One, &quot;Ive&#x27;s Horizon&quot;, first appeared on Giltrap&#x27;s very first album which was released in 1968. Another, &quot;The Passing Of A Queen&quot;, had originally appeared on the 1973 Giltrap album. &quot;Shining Morn&quot; also features a new version of &quot;Dodo&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which had become a staple of Giltrap’s concerts. This version with overdubbing tries to replicate the feeling given during live performances of the piece.

In 2012, Giltrap, reflecting upon the work he had done since &quot;Elegy&quot;, decided to change tack and produce a completely different type of album. To this end, he teamed up with Oliver Wakeman (one of Rick&#x27;s sons), who had recently departed from the band &quot;Yes&quot;. The pair of them produced together the prog rock album &quot;Ravens and Lullabies&quot;, which was released the following year.

Giltrap decided that this collaboration was to involve both their writing skills. Wakeman arranged Esoteric as the record label, found recording studios and located a suitable vocalist in the form of Paul Manzi.

This album reacquainted Giltrap with the electric guitar. Despite on many previous occasions revealing considerable skills with this instrument, he still lacked faith in his own abilities. The results he achieved even surprised himself.

The track &quot;From the Turn of a Card&quot; featured the vocals of Benoit David with whom Wakeman had worked during his time with the band Yes. The album was well received and sold well.

The album was supported by a tour complete with a full band. Giltrap felt uncomfortable attempting to play all the necessary guitar parts himself which would have involved frequent changes of instrument. For this reason, they drafted in guitarist Nick Kendall. The band headlined the Summer&#x27;s End prog rock festival to great acclaim and, their live show proved to be an enormous success.

Giltrap also undertook a tour with Oliver Wakeman at this time with both artists showcasing their own material. They were recruited to support Barclay James Harvest on their 2013 tour.

Alongside his performances with the Ravens band, during 2014 Giltrap continued to tour with his Four Parts Guitar ensemble. Later that year he began performing charity shows at St Giles Hospice in Sutton Coldfield. These gigs were well attended and Giltrap found them very uplifting.

In January the following year, Giltrap’s health began to suffer. He was getting uncomfortable gastric symptoms and these turned out to be very serious when, in June 2015, he was diagnosed with having a GIST or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. He was referred eventually to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Surgery took place on 6 May 2016 and was considerably more invasive than they had hoped it would be. During this time he was supported by his friend, singer / songwriter Carrie Martin, who helped both himself and Hilary through a very traumatic period of their lives. After surgery, which was to prove to be twice as long as expected, Giltrap was very weak and there initially was concern for his future. However, he gradually regained his strength, returning home just a fortnight later. A period of convalescence followed and gradually, despite occasional setbacks, he recovered.

Upon recovery, Giltrap continued gigging and he also began to run workshops teaching his guitar pieces to groups of students. These events have proved popular and have become regular, most recently taking place at a large scout hall near his home in Sutton Coldfield. Events are publicised and sold through his website. Giltrap is a member of the Registry of Guitar Tutors and has long been passionate about sharing guitar techniques with his students.
&quot;Teaching and passing on knowledge is something that has been close to my heart for many years. I have taught in schools, conducted guitar workshops, written columns for various guitar publications, and as already mentioned, have a strong association with the RGT. I was asked to be a patron quite a few years ago. They are bringing out a book of my pieces under the umbrella of The London College of Music. As a self-taught, non-academic musician I&#x27;m honoured to now become &#x27;legit&#x27; within the hallowed portals of the college with this new publication entitled GRADED GILTRAP. The title itself just makes me smile.&quot;

On 31 January 2018, Giltrap learnt the devastating news that Jamie, his son, had passed away suddenly after a short illness. He was not considered to be in danger and so this was very unexpected news. Jamie had followed in his father’s footsteps with regard to a keen interest in music but his interests were of a very different genre. He had begun working as a DJ with dance music using the name DJ Tango. He was well respected and according to one source:
&quot;changed the rave music scene and produced some amazing music, ... (helping to) shape and build the foundations for drum &amp; bass in the days when Coventry was at the forefront of the best all-night rave clubs in the UK every weekend. Thousands traveled from all over the UK to queue for hours to get in. For those who had pleasure to know him or go to one of his sets, it was always a good night.&quot;

In order to help overcome his grief, Giltrap threw himself into other projects. One most dear to his own heart was an album he was working on at the time of Jamie&#x27;s passing. It had been conceived to help to raise funds for Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where Giltrap himself had been treated. This was his way of saying thank you for the wonderful treatment he had received at the hospital and to the many friends he had made there. Entitled &quot;Heartsongs&quot;, the album, a revised release of &quot;Shining Morn&quot;, included his all-star version of &quot;Heartsong&quot;. The album is available for purchase only through the hospital charity and all proceeds are diverted towards cancer research. The story surrounding its production is detailed on Giltrap’s website which includes a link to purchase a copy. The album is dedicated to Jamie&#x27;s memory.

Another project which came to fruition around the time of Jamie&#x27;s passing was the publication of Giltrap&#x27;s authorised biography by Steve Pilkington. The foreword was written by Del Newman. The book was published on 5 October 2018 and is dedicated to Jamie&#x27;s memory.

During his years in the music business, Giltrap has attracted admiration from other celebrities, one such being Pete Townshend of the Who. Giltrap has always cited Townshend as being a strong influence on his guitar playing. In a 2019 interview, he stated:
&quot;There truly is only one (person I&#x27;d like to collaborate with) and that has to be Pete Townshend, not just because he is cited as an influence on the way I play the guitar, but the power and eloquence of his creativity. He really is a towering genius within the annals of rock music and for me the Who were and still are the greatest rock band ever. I had the great pleasure of meeting Pete for the first time in 2017 and a more gracious and generous man you couldn&#x27;t wish to be with. When I was going through serious health problems, he gifted me one of his Gibson J-200 signature guitars, and we hadn&#x27;t even met at that time. Brian May did a similar thing to help raise my spirits. I shall never forget both those acts of kindness.&quot;

To his delight, Giltrap and Townshend finally met at a Who concert in Birmingham&#x27;s Barclaycard Arena in 2017 and he was delighted to be asked to play on a Who album Townshend was working on. The piece he was asked to contribute to was entitled &quot;She Rocked My World&quot;, and Giltrap travelled to Townshend&#x27;s home to record it. The resultant album, &quot;Who&quot;, was released on 6 December 2019.

Giltrap has continued to tour the UK playing smaller, more intimate venues occasionally supported by Nick Hooper or Carrie Martin. He collaborated on two tracks from Martin&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Entity&quot;: &quot;Time after Time&quot; and &quot;White Kites&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, according to his website, Giltrap remained creative in the period of restriction. No longer having to concentrate on his performances, he has been busy composing pieces for new albums, using musicians such as Ian Mosley and Rod Edwards. In November 2020, he promoted the release of a Christmas song for University Hospitals Birmingham Charity he had helped produce, penned by his friend Carrie Martin and recorded by a choir of hospital staff before the pandemic

On 31 January 2020, Giltrap released the album &quot;Woman&quot;. This was inspired by the many women who had influenced Giltrap during his life, particularly his wife, Hilary. It is her photograph which graces the album&#x27;s cover. Many of the tracks were commissions from husbands dedicated to their wives.

== Personal life ==

Giltrap married his first wife Maureen in June 1970 and they had two children. 
His son, Jamie, who was a Drum &amp; Bass pioneer and who went by the name DJ Tango, passed away January 31st 2018
The couple divorced in 1981. Giltrap married his second wife, Hilary, on 22 May 1986. Hilary died on 30 December 2022, aged 83.

== Influences ==
Giltrap cites Hank Marvin, the Beatles, Pete Townshend, Donovan, Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Julian Bream, John Williams, Edward Elgar and Ralph Vaughan Williams as his main musical influences.

==Awards and honours==
In 2000, Giltrap was inducted into the Grand Order of Water Rats, a celebrity charitable organisation.

In 2019, Giltrap was awarded with an MBE for his &quot;for services to music and to charity&quot;. His award was announced in the 2018 honours list and the medal was presented to him by Prince Charles on 7 March 2019.

<text>James McKeen Cattell (May 25, 1860 – January 20, 1944) was the first professor of psychology in the United States, teaching at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He was a long-time editor and publisher of scientific journals and publications, including &quot;Science&quot;, and served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science from 1921 to 1944.

At the beginning of Cattell&#x27;s career, many scientists regarded psychology simply as a minor field of study, or as a pseudoscience like phrenology. Cattell helped establish psychology as a legitimate science, worthy of study at the highest levels of the academy. At the time of his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited him as &quot;the dean of American science.&quot;

Cattell was uncompromisingly opposed to American involvement in World War I. His public opposition to the draft led to his dismissal from his position at Columbia University, which later led many American universities to establish academic tenure as a means of protecting unpopular beliefs.

==Early life and education==
Cattell was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, on May 25, 1860, the eldest child of a wealthy and prominent family. His father, William Cassady Cattell, a Presbyterian minister, became president of Lafayette College in Easton shortly after James&#x27; birth. In 1859, William Cattell married Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; McKeen; together, they shared Lizzie&#x27;s substantial inheritance. James&#x27; uncle Alexander G. Cattell represented New Jersey in the United States Senate.

Cattell entered Lafayette College in 1876 at the age of sixteen and graduated in four years with the highest honors. In 1883, the faculty at Lafayette awarded him an M.A., again with highest honors. At Lafayette, Cattell spent most of his time devouring English literature and also showed a gift for mathematics. Cattell said Francis March, a philogist, was a great influence during his time at Lafayette.

Cattell found his calling after arriving in Germany for doctoral studies, where he was supervised by Wilhelm Wundt at University of Leipzig. He also studied under Hermann Lotze at the University of Göttingen. An essay on Lotze won Cattell a fellowship at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

In October 1882, Cattell left Germany for his fellowship in October 1882. The fellowship was not renewed, and Cattell returned to Leipzig the next year as Wundt&#x27;s assistant.

The partnership between Wundt and Cattell proved highly productive; the two helped to establish the formal study of intelligence. Under Wundt, Cattell became the first American to publish a dissertation in the field of psychology. The title of his German dissertation was &quot;Psychometrische Untersuchungen&quot; (&quot;Psychometric Investigation&quot;); it was accepted by the University of Leipzig in 1886. Cattell tried to explore the interiors of his own mind through the consumption of the then-legal drug hashish. Under the influence of this drug, Cattell once compared the whistling of a schoolboy to a symphony orchestra.

==Career==
===Academia===
After completing his Ph.D. with Wundt in Germany in 1886, Cattell took up a lecturing post at the University of Cambridge in England, and became a Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College at the University of Cambridge. He made occasional visits to the U.S., where he gave lectures at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

In 1889, he returned to the U.S. to become a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1891, he moved to Columbia University, where he became department head of psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. In 1895, he was appointed president of the American Psychological Association. In 1888, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

From the beginning of his career, Cattell worked to establish psychology as a field as worthy of study as any of the hard physical sciences, such as chemistry or physics. He believed that further investigation would reveal that intellect itself could be parsed into standard units of measurements. He also established the methods of Wilhelm Wundt and Francis Galton, including mental testing, in the U.S.

In 1917, Cattell and English professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Dana, grandson of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Richard Henry Dana Jr., were fired from Columbia University for opposing the United States’ conscription policy during World War I. He later sued the university and won an annuity. In 1921, he used the money that he gained from the settlement to start The Psychological Corporation to foster his interest in applied psychology. Because he was never able to really explain how psychologists apply their work, the organization failed until it was taken over by other psychologists who had experience in applied psychology. Towards the end of his life, Cattell edited and published journals. To help himself in the process, he created the Science Press Printing Company in order to produce his journals. He continued his work on journals until his death in 1944.

===Eugenicist beliefs===
Like many eminent scientists and scholars of the time, Cattell&#x27;s thought was influenced by belief in eugenics, defined as the &quot;applied science or the bio-social movement which advocates the use of practices aimed at improving the genetic composition of a population, usually referring to human populations.&quot; Cattell&#x27;s belief in eugenics was heavily influenced by the research of Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution motivated Cattell&#x27;s emphasis on studying “the psychology of individual differences”.

In connection with his eugenicist beliefs, Cattell&#x27;s own research found that men of science were likely to have fathers who were clergymen or professors. Incidentally, Cattell&#x27;s father was both.

Cattell believed that he had “inherited ability&quot;, but he also credited the influence of his environment, saying &quot;it was my fortune to find a birthplace in the sun. A germplasm fairly well compounded [good genes] met circumstances to which it was unusually fit to react”. Cattell&#x27;s belief in eugenics even motivated him to offer his own children monetary gifts of $1,000 if they married the offspring of a university professor or academic professional.

===Mental tests===
Cattell&#x27;s research on individual differences played a significant role in introducing and emphasizing the experimental technique and importance of methodology in experimentation in America. Cattell&#x27;s design of mental tests were influenced by Wundt&#x27;s definition of psychology in regards to the achievements of psychophysics and by Galton&#x27;s view on the importance of the senses for judgement and intelligence. Regarding the beginnings of his mental tests, in Leipzig, Cattell independently began to measure “simple mental processes”

Between 1883 and 1886, influenced by Francis Galton, Cattell published nine articles on human reaction time rates and individual differences. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Cattell administered a battery of ten tests to student volunteers, and for the first time introduced the term &quot;mental tests&quot; as a general term for his set of tests which included measures of sensation, using weights to determine just-noticeable differences, reaction time, human memory span, and rate of movement. There are two types of perspectives on measuring intelligence which are: 1.) Derived from Aristotle that asserts it is only through the identification of intelligence that its measurement becomes possible, through identification does not necessarily imply a definition 2.) all measurement is based on comparison and that different bases of comparison are possible. When Cattell moved to Columbia University, the battery of tests became compulsory for all freshmen. Cattell believed that his mental tests were measuring intelligence; however, in 1901 Clark Wissler, a student of Cattell, demonstrated that there was no statistical relationship between scores on Cattell&#x27;s tests and academic performance. The tests were finally rendered irrelevant with the development of Alfred Binet’s intelligence measurements.

===Journals===
Cattell was well known for his involvement in creating and editing scientific journals. He was so involved in owning and publishing journals, that his research productivity declined. Along with James Mark Baldwin, he co-founded the journal &quot;Psychological Review&quot;. He also acquired the journal &quot;Science&quot; and, within five years of acquiring it, made it the official publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In 1900, Cattell purchased &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; from D. Appleton &amp; Company. In 1915, the title was purchased from him and became &quot;Popular Science&quot;. He, in turn, founded and edited &quot;The Scientific Monthly&quot;, which went to the subscribers of the old &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; as a substitute.

Cattell was the editor of &quot;Science&quot; for nearly 50 years. During that time, he did much to promote psychology as a science by seeing to it that empirical studies in psychology were prominently featured in the journal. On Cattell&#x27;s editorship of &quot;Science&quot;, Ludy T. Benjamin wrote &quot;there is no denying that it significantly enhanced psychology’s visibility and status among the older sciences.&quot;

===American Men of Science===

In 1906, Cattell became the first compiler of &quot;American Men of Science&quot;. Despite the name, two women, Grace Andrews and Charlotte Angas Scott, were listed in this first edition of &quot;American Men of Science&quot;.

===Skepticism===
Cattell was skeptical of paranormal claims and spiritualism. He dismissed Leonora Piper as a fraud. He was involved in a debate over Piper with the psychologist William James in the &quot;Science&quot; journal. He took issue with James&#x27;s support for psychical research. In a letter to James, Cattell wrote that the &quot;Society for Psychical Research is doing much to injure psychology&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cattell married Josephine Owen, the daughter of an English merchant, in 1888. Their seven children obtained their pre-college educations at home with their parents as instructors. The whole family shared in Cattell&#x27;s editorial work. One daughter, Psyche Cattell (1893–1989), followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps, establishing a small child psychology practice in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and developing tests to assess the intelligence of infants.

==Death==
Cattell died at Lancaster General Hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on January 20, 1944, at age 83.

==Legacy==
The main street in the College Hill neighborhood of Easton, Pennsylvania, home to Lafayette College, Cattell&#x27;s alma mater, is named after Cattell.

<text>The former Royal Air Force Far East Air Force, more simply known as RAF Far East Air Force, was the Command organisation that controlled all Royal Air Force assets in the east of Asia (Far East). It was originally formed as Air Command, South East Asia in 1943 during the Second World War. In 1946, this was renamed RAF Air Command Far East, and finally Far East Air Force in June 1949.

The command was disbanded on 31 October 1971.

==Early history==
The RAF&#x27;s Far East Command was formed in January 1930 and its first officer commanding, Group Captain Henry Cave-Browne-Cave, was double-hatted as Officer Commanding RAF Singapore. This was upgraded to Headquarters Air Force Far East Command in 1933. During the Second World War, when Malaya, Singapore, Burma and Hong Kong were overrun by the Japanese, the command retreated to India, there receiving the name Air Headquarters Bengal.

The true ancestor of the postwar Far East Air Force was formed on 16 November 1943, under Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command (SEAC). It was initially called South East Asia Air Command, but became Air Command, South East Asia (ACSEA) on 30 December 1943. On 1 July 1944 ACSEA comprised No. 222 Group RAF, No. 225 Group, No. 229 Group RAF, and Eastern Air Command, under U.S. Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer, itself being made up of the Strategic Air Force (7th Bombardment Group USAAF and No. 231 Group RAF, under Brigadier General Howard C. Davidson of the United States Army Air Force); the U.S. Tenth Air Force (80th Fighter Group, 311th Fighter Group, and 443rd Troop Carrier Group); the RAF Third Tactical Air Force (Nos 221 and 224 Groups, No. 177 Wing RAF, 3d Combat Cargo Group USAAF, and 12th Bombardment Group USAAF); the Photographic Reconnaissance Force (No. 171 Wing RAF and U.S. 8th Photographic Reconnaissance Group); and No. 293 Wing RAF. By January 1945 ACSEA&#x27;s subsidiary Base Air Forces South East Asia, under Air Marshal Sir Roderick Carr, comprised No. 223 Group RAF on the North West Frontier at RAF Peshawar, No. 225 Group RAF (responsible for the &quot;air defence of southern India and the whole coastline from Bengal to Karachi,&quot; by January 1943 controlling Nos 172 and 173 Wings), No. 226 Group RAF, No. 227 Group RAF, and No. 230 Group RAF, carrying out maintenance, training, and administration.

The four major RAF formations under HQ ACSEA in India and Ceylon at the end of the war were HQ BAFSEA; AHQ Burma; HQ 222 Group at Columbo, controlling all operational squadrons in Ceylon, largely carrying out maritime duties; and 229 Group, a Transport Command group located in New Delhi. 222 Group disbanded by being renamed AHQ Ceylon on 15 October 1945; it inherited six Liberator squadrons (Nos 99, 356, 203, 8, 160, and 321 RNLAF); four Sunderland squadrons (205, 209, 230, and 240); and No. 136 Squadron with Spitfires. After HQ BAFSEA was merged with AHQ India, twelve RAF squadrons (225 Group: Nos 5, 30 at Bhopal, 45 at St Thomas Mount; 227 Group: 298 Squadron at Samungli with a detachment at Chaklala; No. 228 Group RAF: 176, 658 AOP, 355 at Digri, 159 at Salbani; 229 Group: 353 and 232 at Palam; and 10 and 76 with Dakotas at Poona) remained in India after 1 April 1946, and AHQ India was placed under joint command of the Indian Government and the Air Ministry (Lee Eastward 65-69, Appendix B, 261).

No. 223 Group was disbanded at Peshawar by being redesignated No 1 (Indian) Group on 15 August 1945; No. 225 Group disbanded at Hindustan near Bangalore by being redesignated No 2 (Indian) Group on 1 May 1946; No. 226 Group disbanded at Palam on 31 July 1946, with its units being transferred to No.2 (Indian) Group; No. 227 Group disbanded at Agra on 1 May 1946 by becoming No. 4 (Indian) Group. In May 1945 No. 228 Group had moved to Barrackpore and absorbed No. 230 Group, and then on 1 May 1946 becoming No. 3 (Indian) Group. No. 229 Group disbanded on 31 March 1947 and its responsibilities were taken over by No. 1 (Indian) Group; and No. 231 Group ceased operations on 1 August 1945, with by that time no units assigned, and disbanded on 30 September.

In 1946, ACSEA was renamed RAF Air Command Far East, and finally Far East Air Force in June 1949. The tri-service headquarters remained in place after the war over to coordinate re-occupation of territory within the bounds of the command that had not yet been liberated from the Japanese. That included parts of Burma; the other British colonies of Singapore, Malaya, British North Borneo and Brunei; the independent nation of Siam, the French colony of French Indo-China up to the 16th parallel, and most of the Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. After the completion of the re-occupation duties, SEAC was disestablished in November 1946.

However, the benefits of a supreme commander were not forgotten, and a tri-service headquarters was revived in 1962, when the Far East Command was formed. The Far East Command was also disestablished in 1971.

==Postwar Occupation Duties==
Unlike in Europe, war ended very unexpectedly in the Far East. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, combined with the American blockade of Japan, and the Soviet entry into the war on 9 August 1945 finally shocked the Japanese into suing for peace. Once peace came, there was a period of euphoria within the RAF units, but the forces in the region came back down to earth with a bump a few days later.

Instead of the end to operations that a great many of the conscripts had naively thought would occur, if anything, operations in some parts of the forces increased in tempo. South-East Asia Command had been increased in size from the day after the surrender, taking in south French Indo-China, and much of the Dutch East Indies. The command was now half as big again in area as it had been during the war. The strain imposed by the high operations tempo that occupation duties, when combined with the downsizing of the command due to demobilisation and return of American aircraft provided under lend-lease aircraft was very great, and it manifested itself in a series of mutinies around the command in early 1946.

The first of these was at Mauripur in Karachi, India. Enlisted airmen downed tools and refused to work until their grievances about demobilisation had been met. Given the nature of the times, this was impossible, although their complaints were passed up the chain of command. The stoppages were non-violent almost to a fault, and since the personnel involved were hostilities-only conscripts, rather than regular professional members of the RAF, the stoppages were not formally treated as mutinies. Had they been so, punishments up to and including execution by firing squad could have been imposed on those responsible. Other mutinies occurred in Ceylon, elsewhere in India and Singapore. They also spread to units of the Royal Indian Air Force for a short while.

===Siam===
The easiest of the occupation tasks was in Siam. Unlike elsewhere in the region, Siam had retained a functioning civil government throughout the war, and thus British troops did not have to deploy to restore order over most of the country. RAF forces set a headquarters in Bangkok, at Don Muang airfield, under Group Captain D O Finlay on 9 September 1945. The headquarters was from No. 909 Wing RAF. The Wing left its previously controlled aircraft, Republic P-47 Thunderbolts in Burma. Three squadrons were represented in Siam during the occupation, No. 20 Squadron RAF with Spitfire VIII aircraft, No. 211 Squadron RAF with de Havilland Mosquito VI aircraft, and a detachment of No. 685 Squadron RAF with Mosquito photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The airfield was defended by No. 2945 Squadron RAF Regiment. In addition to the resident forces, Douglas Dakota transport aircraft were frequent users of Don Muang. They made supply runs to the airport, stopped over on trips to and from French Indo-China, and evacuated prisoners of war and internees who had been imprisoned in Siam at the end of the war. The job in Siam was completed very quickly, with almost all of the RAF personnel at Don Muang being gone by January 1946.

===Burma===
Burma was also relatively straightforward to deal with, although more complicated than Siam. Much of the colony had been conquered several months before the war ended, in the big British offensive of summer 1945. That gave ACSEA crucial breathing space to start getting the colony back on its feet before the massive increase in occupation duties postwar occurred. Air Headquarters Burma was well established under Air Marshal Sir Hugh Saunders. At the end of the war, it had 28 squadrons under its control. This quickly reduced as the demobilisation really kicked in. Again, the transport squadrons saw the largest amount of work, evacuating POWs and internees and supplying garrisons and the civilian population. Second to the transport squadrons in workload were the photo reconnaissance aircraft. The opportunity was taken to complete the process of surveying SE Asia from the air, and using the survey to bring maps up to date. The survey was not completed until August 1947. After the clean-up immediately postwar, came the task of preparing Burma for independence. AHQ Burma moved out of Rangoon to Mingaladon on 1 January 1947. The headquarters was disbanded on 31 December 1947, and three months later Burma became independent.

===French Indo-China and Dutch East Indies===
The most prickly tasks in the entire command were the temporary occupations of the colonies of other European powers. One was the occupation of part of French Indo-China, and the other was the occupation of part of the Dutch East Indies.

The easier of the two was French Indo-China. Resentment against the French was strong, with Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Minh movement beginning to become a real problem. British forces were responsible for the southern part of the country, south of the 16th parallel, while Chinese forces dealt with the north. An RAF headquarters was set up near Saigon on 8 September, at Tan Son Nhut airfield. However, the main occupation forces were slow to arrive. Thus Mountbatten had to use Japanese forces still in the area for internal security duties for a short while. One aspect of the occupation that was smaller in magnitude than in other areas of the command was the prisoners of war. Only about 5,000 prisoners of war were in French Indo-China, and thus that part of the repatriation problem was small.

At Tan Son Nhut, a large amount of space was available for transport aircraft; it had hard standings (all-weather concrete supports for landed aircraft) for about 70 Dakotas. This was fortunate since a great number of transport aircraft was required in the country, despite the low population of POWs. The other aircraft at the airfield were Spitfires of No. 273 Squadron RAF and a detachment of photo-reconnaissance Mosquitoes. The situation in French Indo-China and the Netherlands East Indies was particularly tricky because of the hostility of the locals to the returning colonial powers. French Indo-China was handed back to French control a great deal faster than the Dutch East Indies reverted back to Dutch control. This meant that in French Indo-China RAF aircraft did not have to get involved in suppressing any revolts in the area, apart from one occasion when Spitfires attacked enemy forces with cannon fire to support French ground troops. The RAF provided some spare Spitfires in the command to French Air Force pilots who were being sent to the colony, and more Spitfires were sent from Europe. The main RAF presence was withdrawn in mid-February 1946, when the Air Headquarters was disbanded. However, a small RAF presence was retained for a few more months to help direct military transport aircraft using the airfield.

== Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation ==

The Indonesian–Malaysian Confrontation during 1962–1966 was Indonesia&#x27;s political and armed opposition to the creation of Malaysia. It is also known by its Indonesian/Malay name Konfrontasi. The creation of Malaysia was the amalgamation of the Federation of Malaya (now West Malaysia), Singapore and the crown colony/British protectorates of Sabah and Sarawak (collectively known as British Borneo, now East Malaysia) in September 1963.

The confrontation was an undeclared war with most of the action in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo (known as Kalimantan in Indonesia). Sabah and Sarawak were ethnically, religiously and politically diverse and there was some local opposition to joining Malaysia that Indonesia attempted to exploit, although with little success.

The terrain in Borneo was challenging and there were very few roads. Both sides relied on light infantry operations and air transport, although rivers were also used. There was almost no use of offensive airpower. The British and Malaysian Armed Forces provided a significant element of the effort with assistance from the other member nations (Australia and New Zealand) from the combined Far East Strategic Reserve stationed then in West Malaysia and Singapore.

Initial Indonesian attacks into East Malaysia relied heavily on local volunteers trained by the Indonesian Army. The main military forces backing Malaysia were British and initially their activities were low key. The British responded to increased Indonesian activity by expanding their own. This included, starting in 1965, covert operations into Indonesian Kalimantan under the code name Operation Claret. In 1965 there were several Indonesian operations into West Malaysia, but without military success. By August 1966, following Indonesian President Suharto&#x27;s rise to power, a peace agreement finally took effect as Indonesia accepted the existence of Malaysia.

== Drawdown and departure ==
RAF units and forces in Burma, the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, and Siam/Thailand left in 1945–1947. Forces in India departed in 1947, though many RAF officers and other personnel stayed on for a time with the Royal Pakistan Air Force and the Indian Air Force.

Air Headquarters Malaya (AHQ Malaya) was disbanded on 31 August 1957. No. 222 Group RAF was raised to command status as AHQ Ceylon on 16 Oct 1945. This was in turn disbanded on 1 November 1957. Its stations, including RAF Negombo, 22 miles north of Columbo, had been handed over to the Royal Ceylon Air Force in the course of 1955–56.

<text>Poetry took numerous forms in medieval Europe, for example, lyric and epic poetry. The troubadours, trouvères, and the minnesänger are known for composing their lyric poetry about courtly love usually accompanied by an instrument.

Among the most famous of secular poetry is &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, a manuscript collection of 254 poems. Twenty-four poems of &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; were later set to music by German composer Carl Orff in 1936.

==Examples of medieval poetry==
Old English religious poetry includes the poem &quot;Christ&quot; by Cynewulf and the poem &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;, preserved in both manuscript form and on the Ruthwell Cross. We do have some secular poetry; in fact a great deal of medieval literature was written in verse, including the Old English epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Scholars are fairly sure, based on a few fragments and on references in historic texts, that much lost secular poetry was set to music, and was spread by traveling minstrels, or bards, across Europe. Thus, the few poems written eventually became ballads or lays, and never made it to being recited without song or other music.

=== Medieval Latin literature ===
In medieval Latin, while verse in the old quantitative meters continued to be written, a new more popular form called the sequence arose, which was based on accentual metres in which metrical feet were based on stressed syllables rather than vowel length. These metres were associated with Christian hymnody.

However, much secular poetry was also written in Latin. Some poems and songs, like the Gambler&#x27;s Mass (&quot;officio lusorum&quot;) from the Carmina Burana, were parodies of Christian hymns, while others were student melodies: folksongs, love songs and drinking ballads. The famous commercium song &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot; is one example. There are also a few narrative poems of the period, such as the unfinished epic Ruodlieb, which tells us the story of a knight&#x27;s adventures.

==Medieval vernacular literature==
One of the features of the Renaissance which marked the end of the medieval period is the rise in the use of the vernacular or the language of the common people for literature. The compositions in these local languages were often about the legends and history of the areas in which they were written which gave the people some form of national identity. Epic poems, sagas, chansons de geste and acritic songs (songs of heroic deeds) were often about the great men, real or imagined, and their achievements like Arthur, Charlemagne and El Cid.

The earliest recorded European vernacular literature is that written in the Irish language. Given that Ireland had escaped absorption into the Roman Empire, this had time to develop into a highly sophisticated literature with well-documented formal rules and highly organised bardic schools. The result was a large body of prose and verse recording the ancient myths and sagas of the Gaelic-speaking people of the island, as well as poems on religious, political and geographical themes and a body of nature poetry.

The formality which Latin had gained through its long written history was often not present in the vernaculars which began producing poetry, and so new techniques and structures emerged, often derived from oral literature. This is particularly noticeable in the Germanic languages, which, unlike the Romance languages, are not direct descendants from Latin. Alliterative verse, where many of the stressed words in each line start with the same sound, was often used in the local poetry of that time. Other features of vernacular poetry of this time include kennings, internal rhyme, and slant rhyme. Indeed, Latin poetry traditionally used meter rather than rhyme and only began to adopt rhyme after being influenced by these new poems.

<text>The contrabassoon, also known as the double bassoon, is a larger version of the bassoon, sounding an octave lower. Its technique is similar to its smaller cousin, with a few notable differences.

== Differences from the bassoon ==
The reed is considerably larger than the bassoon&#x27;s, at in total length (and in width) compared with for most bassoon reeds. The large blades allow ample vibration that produces the low register of the instrument. The contrabassoon reed is similar to an average bassoon&#x27;s in that scraping the reed affects both the intonation and response of the instrument.
Contrabassoons feature a slightly simplified version of bassoon keywork, though all open toneholes on bassoon have necessarily been replaced with keys and pads due to the physical distances. In the lower register, its fingerings are nearly identical to bassoon. However, the octave mechanism used to play in the middle register works differently than on bassoon, and the upper register fingerings are often completely unrelated.

The instrument is twice as long as the bassoon, curves around on itself twice and, due to its weight and shape, is supported by an endpin rather than a seat strap. Additional support is sometimes provided by a strap around the player&#x27;s neck. A wider hand position is also required, as the primary finger keys are widely spaced. The contrabassoon has a water key to expel condensation and a tuning slide for gross pitch adjustments. The instrument comes in a few pieces (plus bocal); some models cannot be disassembled without a screwdriver. Sometimes, the bell can be detached, and instruments with a low A extension often come in two parts.

== Range, notation and tone ==

The contrabassoon is a very deep-sounding woodwind instrument that plays in the same sub-bass register as the tuba, double bass, or contrabass clarinet. It has a sounding range beginning at B0 (or A0, on some instruments) and extending up over three octaves to D4, though the highest fourth is rarely scored for. Donald Erb and Kalevi Aho write even higher in their concertos for the instrument (to A4 and C5, respectively), but this is extraordinary and well beyond the expectations of the typical instrument or player. At the lower end, Richard Bobo of the Tulsa Symphony has designed a &quot;subcontrabassoon&quot;, a full octave below the contrabassoon, and is intent on manufacturing the first working prototype. Steven Braunstein of the San Francisco Symphony has built custom extensions to reliably reach a low G0 in performance. 

Contrabassoon parts are notated an octave above sounding pitch, and most often use bass clef. Like bassoon, extended high-register passages may use tenor clef, though this is rarely necessary due to the rarity of such passages. The use of treble clef is even less common, and is only necessary for the most ambitious solo repertoire.

Tonally, it sounds similar to the bassoon, but at all parts of its compass is distinctly different in tone from it. There is a &quot;thinning&quot; of the sound in extreme high register, as in all double reeds, but unlike oboe and bassoon which become more penetrative and &quot;intense&quot; in this register, the contrabassoon&#x27;s sound becomes less audibly substantial and is easily drowned out. Conversely, contrabassoon also has a booming quality, similar to organ pedals, in its lowest register; enabling it to produce powerful contrabass tones when desired (aided by the flared bell, which the bassoon does not have). The contrabassoon can also produce a &quot;buzz&quot; or &quot;rattle&quot;, particularly when loud and in its low register, which gives the sound an edged quality. This effect can be mitigated greatly by changes to the reed design, but it can be a desirable quality for some players, as it adds to the sinister or monstrous quality which some contrabassoon writing seeks to affect, and causes the contrabassoon sound to be more prominent in musical textures.

== History ==

=== Precursors ===
Precursors to the contrabassoon are documented as early as 1590 in Austria and Germany, at a time when the growing popularity of doubling the bass line led to the development of lower-pitched dulcians. Examples of these low-pitched dulcians include the octavebass, the quintfagott, and the quartfagott. There is evidence that a contrafagott was used in Frankfurt in 1626. Baroque precursors to the contrabassoon developed in France in the 1680s, and later in England in the 1690s, independent of the dulcian developments in Austria and Germany during the previous century.

=== Baroque era – present ===

The contrabassoon was developed, especially in England, in the mid-18th century; the oldest surviving instrument, which came in four parts and has only three keys, was built in 1714. It was around that time that the contrabassoon began gaining acceptance in church music. Some notable early uses of the contrabassoon during this period include in J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. John&#x27;s Passion&quot; (1749 and 1739-1749 versions), and G.F. Handel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot; (1740) and &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; (1749). Until the late 19th century, the instrument typically had a weak tone and poor intonation. For this reason, the contrabass woodwind parts often were scored for, and contrabassoon parts were often played on a serpent, contrabass sarrusophone or, less frequently, reed contrabass, until improvements by Heckel in the late 19th century secured the contrabassoon&#x27;s place as the standard double reed contrabass.

For more than a century, between 1880 and 2000, Heckel’s design remained relatively unchanged. Chip Owen, at the American company Fox, began manufacturing an instrument in 1971 with some improvements. Generally, during the 20th century changes to the instrument were limited to an upper vent key near the bocal socket, a tuning slide, and a few key linkages to facilitate technical passages. In 2000, Heckel announced a completely new keywork for its instrument and Fox introduced its own new key system based on input from New York Philharmonic contrabassoonist Arlan Fast. Both companies&#x27; improvements allow for improved technical facility as well as greater range in the high register. Benedikt Eppelsheim developed the Contraforte, a &quot;redesigned contrabassoon&quot;, in collaboration with Guntram Wolf in the early 2000s.

== Current use ==
Most major orchestras use one contrabassoonist, either as a primary player or a bassoonist who doubles, as do a large number of symphonic bands.

The contrabassoon is a supplementary orchestral instrument and is most frequently found in larger symphonic works, often doubling the bass trombone or tuba at the octave. Frequent exponents of such scoring were Brahms and Mahler, as well as Richard Strauss, and Dmitri Shostakovich. The first composer to write a separate contrabassoon part in a symphony was Beethoven, in his Fifth Symphony (1808) (it can also be heard providing the bass line in the brief &quot;Janissary band&quot; section of the fourth movement of his Symphony No. 9, just prior to the tenor solo), although Bach, Handel (in his &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot;), Haydn (e.g., in both of his oratorios &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot;, where the part for the contrabassoon and the bass trombone are mostly, but not always, identical), and Mozart had occasionally used it in other genres (e.g., in the &quot;Coronation Mass&quot;). Composers have often used the contrabassoon to comical or sinister effect by taking advantage of its seeming &quot;clumsiness&quot; and its sepulchral rattle, respectively. A clear example of this can be heard in Paul Dukas&#x27; &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (originally scored for contrabass sarrusophone). Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; is one of the few orchestral works that requires two contrabassoons.

As a featured instrument, the contrabassoon can be heard in several works, most notably Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Mother Goose Suite&quot;, and at the opening of &quot;Piano Concerto for the Left Hand&quot;. Gustav Holst gave the contrabassoon multiple solos in &quot;The Planets&quot;, primarily in &quot;Mercury, the Winged Messenger&quot; and &quot;Uranus, the Magician&quot;.

Solo literature is somewhat lacking, although some modern composers such as Gunther Schuller, Donald Erb, Michael Tilson Thomas, John Woolrich, Kalevi Aho, Ruth Gipps and Daniel Dorff have written concertos for this instrument (see below). Stephen Hough has written a trio for piccolo, contrabassoon and piano &quot;Was mit den Tränen geschieht&quot;. Contrabassoon may theoretically play music for bassoon, which has much more solo repertoire, but the sonic and mechanical differences from the bassoon (and bassoon&#x27;s comparative facility in the high register) mean that bassoon repertoire is not always suited to contra.

==Notable solos and soloists==
Most major symphony orchestras employ a contrabassoon, and many have programmed concerts featuring their contrabassoonist as soloist. For example, Michael Tilson Thomas: Urban Legend for Contrabassoon and Orchestra featuring Steven Braunstein, San Francisco Symphony; Gunther Schuller: Concerto for Contrabassoon featuring Lewis Lipnick, National Symphony Orchestra; John Woolrich: Falling Down featuring Margaret Cookhorn, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra; Erb: Concerto for Contrabassoon featuring Gregg Henegar, London Symphony Orchestra; Kalevi Aho: Concerto for Contrabassoon featuring Lewis Lipnick Bergen Symphony Orchestra

One of the few contrabassoon soloists in the world is Susan Nigro, who lives and works in and around Chicago. Besides occasional gigs with orchestras and other ensembles (including regular substitute with the Chicago Symphony), her main work is as soloist and recording artist. Many works have been written specifically for her, and she has released several CDs.

Henry Skolnick has performed and toured internationally on the instrument. He commissioned, premiered and recorded &quot;Aztec Ceremonies&quot; for contrabassoon by Graham Waterhouse.

A rare use of the instrument in jazz was by Garvin Bushell, who sat in as a guest with saxophonist John Coltrane during his 1961 recording sessions at the Village Vanguard.

== Manufacturers ==
=== Current ===
, there are nine firms which manufacture contrabassoons (in alphabetical order):
*Amati
*Fox
*Heckel
*Kronwalt (a collaboration between Guntram Wolf and Rudolf Walter)
*Mönnig-Adler
*Mollenhauer (also manufactures contrabassoons under the Schreiber brand)
*Moosmann 
*Püchner

*Takeda

=== Historic ===
These firms once manufactured contrabassoons, but no longer do so. 
* Lignatone (Czechoslovakia)
* Cabart (Paris) stopped after purchase by Lorée in 1974.
* Buffet Crampon (Paris): Keywork differentiated from the German style somewhat.

<text>The Maeslantkering (&quot;Maeslant barrier&quot; in Dutch) is a storm surge barrier on the Nieuwe Waterweg, in South Holland, Netherlands. It was constructed from 1991 to 1997. As part of the Delta Works the barrier responds to water level predictions calculated by a centralized computer system called BOS. It automatically closes when Rotterdam (especially the Port of Rotterdam) is threatened by floods.

Maeslantkering has two 210-metre long barrier gates, with two 237-metre long steel trusses holding each. When closed, the barrier will protect the entire width (360 metres) of the Nieuwe Waterweg, the main waterway of Port of Rotterdam. It is one of the largest moving structures on Earth, rivalling the Green Bank Telescope in the United States and the Bagger 288 excavator in Germany.

==The Maeslant Barrier==

===The initial plan===
The construction of the Maeslantkering was a part of the Europoortkering project which, in turn, was the final stage of the Delta Works. The main objective of this Europoortkering-project was to improve the safety against flooding of the Rotterdam harbour, of which the Europoort is an important part, and the surrounding towns and agricultural areas. To achieve this, the initial plan was to reinforce existing dikes as far as 50 kilometres inland. During the 1980s, it became clear that this project would take at least 30 years and would cost a huge amount of money. It would also mean that historic town centres, in some cases over four centuries old, would have to be broken down and rebuilt behind renewed, larger dikes.

Therefore, the initial plan was put aside and the Ministry of Waterways and Public Works organised a competition in which construction companies could make plans for the construction of a reliable yet relatively cheap storm surge barrier.

===The storm surge barrier===
This storm surge barrier had to be located in the waterway (Nieuwe Maas – the Scheur – Nieuwe Waterweg) that connects Rotterdam with the North Sea. This played an important role in the planning stage of the construction, as this waterway is the main route to the port of Rotterdam, at that time the world&#x27;s largest port. Therefore, a barrier like the Dutch Oosterscheldekering and the Thames Barrier could not be constructed, as such a barrier would block the shipping route.

The winning plan called for two large floating gates on both dikes of the waterway. A major advantage of this plan was that construction of the storm surge barrier could take place under dry conditions, in dry docks. Other advantages were that no vital parts of the barrier had to be placed under water, and maintenance of the barrier would be easy because of the dry docks. Finally, there would be almost no inconvenience for passing ships. The winning plan was put forward by the BMK consortium (Bouwcombinatie Maeslantkering). This consortium included the contractors HBG (now BAM), Volker Stevin and Hollandia Kloos. The storm surge barrier project was one of the first large Design and Construct projects for which the contractor also prepares the design.

===Construction of the barrier===
The construction of the barrier started in 1991. First, the dry docks were constructed on both shores and a sill was constructed at the bottom of the Nieuwe Waterweg. Then, the two 22-metre high and 210-metre long steel gates were built. After this, 237-metre long steel trusses were welded to the gates. The arms weigh 6,800 tonnes each. The main purpose of the arms is transmitting the immense forces, exerted on the gates while closed, to one single joint at the rear of each gate. During the closing or opening process, this ball-shaped joint gives the gate the opportunity to move freely under the influences of water, wind, and waves. It acts like a ball and socket joint, such as in the human shoulder or hip. The joints were made in the Czech Republic at Škoda Works. The ball-shaped joint is the largest in the world, with a diameter of 10 metres, and weighing 680 tonnes. The construction of the barrier cost 450 million euro. The total Europoortkering-project had cost 660 million euros.

A working 1:250 scale version of the barrier was constructed in the Madurodam miniature village. Its construction took six months. It took six years to construct the real barrier.

===Maeslantkering in operation===
On 10 May 1997, after six years of construction, Queen Beatrix opened the Maeslantkering. The barrier is connected to a computer system which is linked to weather and sea level data. Under normal weather conditions, the two doors themselves are well protected in their dry docks and a 360-metre wide gap in the waterway gives ships enough space to pass without any inconvenience. But when a storm surge of 3 metres above normal sea level is anticipated in Rotterdam, the barrier will be closed automatically. Four hours before the actual closing procedure begins, incoming and outgoing ships are warned. Two hours before closing, the traffic at the Nieuwe Waterweg comes to a standstill. Thirty minutes before closing, the dry docks that contain the gates are flooded. After this, the gates start to float and two so-called &quot;locomobiles&quot; move the gates towards each other. When the gap between the gates is about 1.5 metres wide, water is let inside the hollows of the gates, so that they submerge to the bottom of the waterway. The bottom has been elaborately dug and then laid with layers of broken stone, so that the gates are able to form a relatively watertight fit when submerged. In cases where the gates have to be shut for a prolonged period, which would cause the waters of the Rhine to rise behind them, the gate hollows are partly emptied and floated, so that excess river water runs out to sea, before they are submerged again. The decision-making algorithm that sequences storm surge-triggered events in the Maeslantkering is run entirely by computer.

The Maeslantkering is expected to be closed once every ten years due to storm surge. With the rise in sea levels, the storm surge barrier will need to close more frequently in 50 years time, namely once every five years. In its first 10 years of operation, the barrier was never closed due to a storm. There was one incident when a storm surge of 3 metres was predicted and the protective sequence was initiated. However, during the course of the storm, predictions were revised to a 2.99 m surge and the computer cancelled closure. Eventually, the surge passed harmlessly and the waterway remained open. During the evening of 8 November 2007, the barrier was closed due to a storm surge for the first time. The barrier is closed for testing once a year, usually at the end of September or the beginning of October, just before the beginning of the storm season in mid-October. Activities are held during the closing for the visiting public. The information center publishes information about the closing time and activities on its website.

The , located just south of the Nieuwe Waterweg and the Scheuer, visible in some images on this page, is protected by the much smaller Hartelkering storm surge barrier. This barrier is constructed some 5 kilometres further inland.

The software that drives it is written in C++ and consists of 200,000 lines of code for the operational system and 250,000 lines of code for the simulation systems.

The barrier is designed to withstand a storm that has an occurrence of only once in 10,000 years (based on the climate at the time, but this may have to be adjusted for climate change).

===8 November 2007 storm===
In order to test the barrier in actual stormy conditions, the water level threshold at which the computer system would start the closing procedure was lowered from 3.0 m over NAP to 2.6 m, for the duration of the 2007 storm season. On 8 November 2007, a storm from the northwest hit the Dutch coast. A storm surge, high enough to start the barrier&#x27;s closing procedure, occurred. The barrier was closed due to a storm surge for the first time since its construction. As the Oosterscheldekering and Hartelkering storm surge barriers were also closed, the entire Dutch coast was protected against flooding for the first time since 1976. At 22:00 local time (CET), Dutch TV brought the news that maritime traffic on the Nieuwe Waterweg was shut off. The closing procedure of the Maeslantkering started at 23:10. The barrier was completely closed at 01:00 and was reopened on 9 November around 17:00.

===21 December 2023 storm===
On December 21, 2023 the Maeslantkering was closed automatically at the 3.0 m threshold for the first time in history. During the day a forecast had been made that the water level in Rotterdam would reach critical height of 3.0 m above NAP at around 23:30. There were discussions to close the Maeslantkering manually before that time, and the Port of Rotterdam started reducing traffic at 16:00.
Around 18:00 the traffic across the Nieuwe Waterweg came to a complete standstill. Before the decision was actually made to manually close the Maeslantkering, the computer systems intervened and had begun the automatic closing procedure. Closing started at 20:15, a process which takes about 2 hours. The next day at 4:45 the gates were opened again.

<doc id="274736" wikidata="Q461786" url="?curid=274736" title="Jizya">
<text>Jizya (), or jizyah, is a type of taxation historically levied on non-Muslim subjects of a state governed by Islamic law. The Quran and hadiths mention jizya without specifying its rate or amount, and the application of jizya varied in the course of Islamic history. However, scholars largely agree that early Muslim rulers adapted some of the existing systems of taxation and modified them according to Islamic religious law.

Historically, the jizya tax has been understood in Islam as a fee for protection provided by the Muslim ruler to non-Muslims, for the exemption from military service for non-Muslims, for the permission to practice a non-Muslim faith with some communal autonomy in a Muslim state, and as material proof of the non-Muslims&#x27; allegiance to the Muslim state and its laws. The majority of Muslim jurists required adult, free, sane males among the dhimma community to pay the jizya, while exempting women, children, elders, handicapped, the ill, the insane, monks, hermits, slaves, and musta&#x27;mins—non-Muslim foreigners who only temporarily reside in Muslim lands. However, some jurists, such as Ibn Hazm, required that anyone who had reached puberty pay jizya. Islamic Regimes allowed dhimmis to serve in Muslim armies. Those who chose to join military service were also exempted from payment, some Muslim scholars claim that some Islamic rulers exempted those who could not afford to pay from the Jizya.

Together with kharāj, a term that was sometimes used interchangeably with jizya, taxes levied on non-Muslim subjects were among the main sources of revenues collected by some Islamic polities, such as the Ottoman Empire and Indian Muslim Sultanates. Jizya rate was usually a fixed annual amount depending on the financial capability of the payer. Sources comparing taxes levied on Muslims and jizya differ as to their relative burden depending on time, place, specific taxes under consideration, and other factors.

The term appears in the Quran referring to a tax or tribute from &quot;People of the Book,&quot; specifically Jews and Christians.
Followers of other religions like Zoroastrians and Hindus too were later integrated into the category of &quot;dhimmis&quot; and required to pay jizya. In the Indian Subcontinent the practice stopped by the 18th century with Muslim rulers losing their kingdoms to the Maratha Empire and British East India Company. It almost vanished during the 20th century with the disappearance of Islamic states and the spread of religious tolerance. The tax is no longer imposed by nation states in the Islamic world, although there are reported cases of organizations such as the Pakistani Taliban and ISIS attempting to revive the practice.

==Etymology and meaning==
Commentators disagree on the definition and derivation of the word &quot;jizya&quot;. Ann Lambton writes that the origins of &quot;jizya&quot; are extremely complex, regarded by some jurists as &quot;compensation paid by non-Muslims for being spared from death&quot; and by others as &quot;compensation for living in Muslim lands.&quot;

According in Encyclopedia Iranica, the Arabic word &quot;jizya&quot; is most likely derived from Middle Persian &quot;gazītak&quot;, which denoted a tax levied on the lower classes of society in Sasanian Persia, from which the nobles, clergy, landowners (dehqāns), and scribes (or civil servants, dabirān) were exempted. Muslim Arab conquerors largely retained the taxation systems of the Sasanian and Byzantine empires they had conquered.

Shakir&#x27;s English translations of the Qur&#x27;an render &quot;jizya&quot; as &#x27;tax&#x27;, while Pickthall and Arberry translate it as &quot;tribute&quot;. Yusuf Ali prefers to transliterate the term as &quot;jizyah&quot;. Yusuf Ali considered the root meaning of &quot;jizya&quot; to be &quot;compensation,&quot; whereas Muhammad Asad considered it to be &quot;satisfaction.&quot;

Al-Raghib al-Isfahani (d. 1108), a classical Muslim lexicographer, writes that &quot;jizya&quot; is a &quot;tax that is levied on Dhimmis, and it is so named because it is in return for the protection they are guaranteed.&quot; He points out that derivatives of the word appear in some Qurʾānic verses as well, such as:

* &quot;Such is the reward (jazāʾ) of those who purify themselves&quot; (Q 20:76)
* &quot;While those who believed and did good deeds will have the best of rewards&quot; (Q 18:88)
* &quot;And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation – his reward is [due] from God&quot; (Q 42:40)
* &quot;And will reward them for what they patiently endured [with] a garden [in Paradise] and silk [garments]&quot; (Q 76:12)
* &quot;and be repaid only according to your deeds&quot; (Q 37:39)

Muhammad Abdel-Haleem states that the term poll tax does not translate the Arabic word &quot;jizya&quot;, being also inaccurate in light of the exemptions granted to children, women, etc., unlike a poll tax, which by definition is levied on every individual (poll = head) regardless of gender, age, or ability to pay. He further adds that the root verb of &quot;jizya&quot; is j-z-y, which means &#x27;to reward somebody for something&#x27;, &#x27;to pay what is due in return for something&#x27; and adds that it is in return for the protection of the Muslim state with all the accruing benefits and exemption from military service, and such taxes on Muslims as &quot;zakat&quot;.

The historian al-Tabari and the hadith scholar al-Bayhaqi relate that some members of the Christian community asked ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab if they could refer to the &quot;jizya&quot; as &quot;sadaqah&quot;, literally &#x27;charity&#x27;, which he allowed. Based on this historical event, the majority of jurists from Shāfiʿīs, Ḥanafīs and Ḥanbalīs state that it is lawful to take the &quot;jizya&quot; from &quot;ahl al-dhimmah&quot; by name of &quot;zakāt&quot; or &quot;ṣadaqah&quot;, meaning it is not necessary to call the tax that is taken from them by jizya, and also based on the known legal maxim that states, &quot;consideration is granted to objectives and meanings and not to terms and specific wordings.&quot;

According to &quot;Lane&#x27;s Lexicon&quot;, &quot;jizya&quot; is the tax that is taken from the free non-Muslim subjects of an Islamic government, whereby they ratify the pact that ensures them protection.

Michael G. Morony states that:[The emergence of] protected status and the definition of &quot;jizya&quot; as the poll tax on non-Muslim subjects appears to have been achieved only by the early eighth century. This came as a result of growing suspicions about the loyalty of the non-Muslim population during the second civil war and of the literalist interpretation of the Quran by pious Muslims.Jane Dammen McAuliffe states that &quot;jizya&quot;, in early Islamic texts, was an annual tribute expected from non-Muslims, and not a poll tax. Similarly, Thomas Walker Arnold writes that &quot;jizya&quot; originally denoted tribute of any type paid by the non-Muslim subjects of the Arab empire, but that it came later on to be used for the capitation-tax, &quot;as the fiscal system of the new rulers became fixed.&quot;

Arthur Stanley Tritton states that both &quot;jizya&quot; in west, and &quot;kharaj&quot; in the east Arabia meant &#x27;tribute&#x27;. It was also called &quot;jawali&quot; in Jerusalem. Shemesh says that Abu Yusuf, Abu Ubayd ibn al-Sallām, Qudama ibn Jaʿfar, Khatib, and Yahya ibn Adam used the terms &quot;Jizya&quot;, &quot;Kharaj&quot;, &quot;Ushr&quot; and &quot;Tasq&quot; as synonyms.

The Arabic lexicographer Edward William Lane, after a careful analysis of the etymology of the term &quot;Jizya&quot;, says: &quot;The tax that is taken from the free non-Muslim subjects of a Muslim government whereby they ratify the compact that assures them protection, as though it were compensation for not being slain&quot;.

==Rationale==
===Payment for protection===
According to Abou Al-Fadl and other scholars, classical Muslim jurists and scholars regard the jizya as a special payment collected from certain non-Muslims in return for the responsibility of protection fulfilled by Muslims against any type of aggression, as well as for non-Muslims being exempt from military service, and in exchange for the aid provided to poor dhimmis. In a treaty made by Khalid with some towns in the neighborhood of Hirah, he writes: &quot;If we protect you, then jizya is due to us; but if we do not, then it is not due.&quot; Early Hanafi jurist Abu Yusuf writes:

In accordance with this order, enormous sums were paid back out of the state treasury, and the Christians called down blessings on the heads of the Muslims, saying, &quot;May God give you rule over us again and make you victorious over the Romans; had it been they, they would not have given us back anything, but would have taken all that remained with us.&quot; Similarly, during the time of the Crusades, Saladin returned the jizya to the Christians of Syria when he was compelled to retract from it. The Christian tribe of al-Jurajima, in the neighborhood of Antioch, made peace with the Muslims, promising to be their allies and fight on their side in battle, on condition that they should not be called upon to pay jizya and should receive their proper share of the booty. The orientalist Thomas Walker Arnold writes that even Muslims were made to pay a tax if they were exempted from military service, like non-Muslims. Thus, the Shafi&#x27;i scholar al-Khaṭīb ash-Shirbīniy states: &quot;Military service is not obligatory for non-Muslims – especially for dhimmis since they give jizya so that we protect and defend them, and not so that he defends us.&quot; Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani states that there is a consensus amongst Islamic jurists that jizya is in exchange for military service. In the case of war, jizya is seen as an option to end hostilities. According to Abu Kalam Azad, one of the main objectives of jizya was to facilitate a peaceful solution to hostility, since non-Muslims who engaged in fighting against Muslims were thereby given the option of making peace by agreeing to pay jizya. In this sense, jizya is seen as a means by which to legalize the cessation of war and military conflict with non-Muslims. In a similar vein, Mahmud Shaltut states that &quot;jizya was never intended as payment in return for one&#x27;s life or retaining one&#x27;s religion, it was intended as a symbol to signify yielding, an end of hostility and a participation in shouldering the burdens of the state.&quot;

===Other rationales===
Modern scholars have also suggested other rationales for the Jizya, both in a historic context, and, among modern Islamist thinkers, as a justification for the use of Jizya in a modern context, including:

*as a symbol of humiliation to remind dhimmis of their status as a conquered people and their subjection to Islamic laws
*as a financial and political incentive for &quot;dhimmis&quot; to convert to Islam. The Muslim jurist and theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi suggested in his interpretation of Q.9:29 that jizya is an incentive to convert. Taking it is not intended to preserve the existence of disbelief (&quot;kufr&quot;) in the world. Rather, he argues, jizya allows the non-Muslim to live amongst Muslims and take part in Islamic civilization in the hope that the non-Muslim will convert to Islam.
*as a substantial source of revenue for at least some times and places (such as the Umayyad era) and as economically inconsequential in others.
*Asma Afsaruddin also writes that around the end of the 8th century CE, &quot;payment of the jizyah began to be conceptualized by a number of influential jurists as a marker of inferior socio-legal status for the non-Muslim&quot;, as &quot;earlier tolerant attitudes toward non-Muslims began to harden&quot;.
*Sayyid Qutb saw it as punishment for &quot;polytheism&quot;.
*Modern Pakistani scholars have taking the stance of viewing the badge of humiliation or as a mercy for non-Muslims for the protection given to them by the Muslims.
*Abdul Rahman Doi has interpreted it as a counterpart of the zakat tax paid by Muslims.
*The 11th century jurist Ibn Hazm elaborates; &quot;Allah has established the infidel&#x27;s ownership of their property only for the institution of booty for Muslims&quot;.
*Muslim Jurist Malik ibn Anas&#x27;s al-Muwatta declares that &quot;Zakat is imposed on the Muslims to purify them and to be given back to their poor, whereas jizya is imposed on the people of the Book to humble them (to show they are subjects of the state).&quot;

==In the Qur&#x27;an==
Jizya is sanctioned by the Qur&#x27;an based on the following verse:

1. &quot;Fight those who believe not in God and the Last Day&quot; (&quot;qātilū-lladhīna lā yuʾminūna bi-llāhi wa-lā bi-l-yawmi-l-ākhir&quot;).

Commenting on this verse, Muhammad Sa&#x27;id Ramadan al-Buti says:[T]he verse commands &quot;qitāl&quot; () and not &quot;qatl&quot; (), and it is known that there is a big distinction between these two words... For you say ″&quot;qataltu&quot; () so-and-so″ if you initiated the fighting, while you say ″&quot;qātaltu&quot; () him″ if you resisted his effort to fight you by a reciprocal fight, or if you forestalled him in that so that he would not get at you unawares.Muhammad Abdel-Haleem writes that there is nothing in the Qur&#x27;an to say that not believing in God and the Last Day is in itself grounds for fighting anyone. Whereas Abū Ḥayyān states &quot;they are so described because their way [of acting] is the way of those who do not believe in God,&quot; Ahmad Al-Maraghī comments:[F]ight those mentioned when the conditions which necessitate fighting are present, namely, aggression against you or your country, oppression and persecution against you on account of your faith, or threatening your safety and security, as was committed against you by the Byzantines, which was what led to Tabuk.

2. &quot;Do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden&quot; (&quot;wa-lā yuḥarrimūna mā ḥarrama-llāhu wa-rasūluh&quot;).

The closest and most viable cause must relate to &quot;jizya&quot;, that is, unlawfully consuming what belongs to the Muslim state, which, al-Bayḍāwī explains, &quot;it has been decided that they should give,&quot; since their own scriptures and prophets forbid breaking agreements and not paying what is due to others. His Messenger in this verse has been interpreted by exegetes as referring to Muḥammad or the People of the Book&#x27;s own earlier messengers, Moses or Jesus. According to Abdel-Haleem, the latter must be the correct interpretation as it is already assumed that the People of the Book did not believe in Muḥammad or forbid what he forbade, so that they are condemned for not obeying their own prophet, who told them to honour their agreements.

3. &quot;Who do not embrace the true faith&quot; or &quot;behave according to the rule of justice&quot; (&quot;wa-lā yadīnūna dīna&#x27;l-ḥaqq&quot;).

A number of translators have rendered the text as &quot;those who do not embrace the true faith/follow the religion of truth&quot; or some variation thereof. Muhammad Abdel-Haleem argues against this translation, preferring instead to render &quot;dīna&#x27;l-ḥaqq&quot; as &#x27;rule of justice&#x27;.

The main meaning of the Arabic &quot;dāna&quot; is &#x27;he obeyed&#x27;, and one of the many meanings of &quot;dīn&quot; is &#x27;behaviour&#x27; (&quot;al-sīra wa&#x27;l-ʿāda&quot;). The famous Arabic lexicographer Fayrūzabādī (d. 817/1415), gives more than twelve meanings for the word &quot;dīn&quot;, placing the meaning &#x27;worship of God, religion&#x27; lower in the list. &quot;Al-Muʿjam al-wasīṭ&quot; gives the following definition: &quot;&#x27;dāna&#x27; is to be in the habit of doing something good or bad; &#x27;dāna bi- something&#x27; is to take it as a religion and worship God through it.&quot; Thus, when the verb &quot;dāna&quot; is used in the sense of &#x27;to believe&#x27; or &#x27;to practise a religion&#x27;, it takes the preposition &quot;bi&quot;- after it (e.g. &quot;dāna bi&#x27;l-Islām&quot;) and this is the only usage in which the word means religion. The jizya verse does not say &quot;lā yadīnūna bi-dīni&#x27;l-ḥaqq&quot;, but rather &quot;lā yadīnūna dīna&#x27;l-ḥaqq&quot;. Abdel-Haleem thus concludes that the meaning that fits the jizya verse is thus &#x27;those who do not follow the way of justice (&quot;al-ḥaqq&quot;)&#x27;, i.e. by breaking their agreement and refusing to pay what is due.

4. &quot;Until they pay jizya with their own hands&quot; (&quot;ḥattā yu&#x27;ṭū-l-jizyata &#x27;an yadin&quot;).

Here &quot;ʿan yad&quot; (from/for/at hand), is interpreted by some to mean that they should pay directly, without intermediary and without delay. Others say that it refers to its reception by Muslims and means &quot;generously&quot; as in &quot;with an open hand,&quot; since the taking of the jizya is a form of munificence that averted a state of conflict. al-Ṭabarī gives only one explanation: that &#x27;it means &quot;from their hands to the hands of the receiver&quot; just as we say &quot;I spoke to him mouth to mouth&quot;, we also say, &quot;I gave it to him hand to hand&quot;&#x27;. M.J. Kister understands &quot;&#x27;an yad&quot; to be a reference to the &quot;ability and sufficient means&quot; of the &quot;dhimmi&quot;. Similarly, Rashid Rida takes the word &quot;Yad&quot; in a metaphorical sense and relates the phrase to the financial ability of the person liable to pay jizya.

5. &quot;While they are subdued&quot; (&quot;wa-hum ṣāghirūn&quot;).

Mark R. Cohen writes that &#x27;while they are subdued&#x27; was interpreted by many to mean the &quot;humiliated state of the non-Muslims&quot;. According to Ziauddin Ahmed, in the view of the majority of &quot;Fuqahā&quot; (Islamic jurists), the jizya was levied on non-Muslims in order to humiliate them for their unbelief. In contrast, Abdel-Haleem writes that this notion of humiliation runs contrary to verses such as, &quot;Do not dispute with the People of the Book except in the best manner&quot; (Q 29:46), and the Prophetic &quot;ḥadīth&quot;, &#x27;May God have mercy on the man who is liberal and easy-going (&quot;samḥ&quot;) when he buys, when he sells, and when he demands what is due to him&#x27;. Al-Shafi&#x27;i, the founder of the Shafi&#x27;i school of law, wrote that a number of scholars explained this last expression to mean that &quot;Islamic rulings are enforced on them.&quot; This understanding is reiterated by the Hanbali jurist Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, who interprets &quot;wa-hum ṣāghirūn&quot; as making all subjects of the state obey the law and, in the case of the People of the Book, pay the jizya.

==In the classical era==

===Liability and exemptions===

Rules for liability and exemptions of jizya formulated by jurists in the early Abbasid period appear to have remained generally valid thereafter.

Islamic jurists required adult, free, sane, able-bodied males of military age with no religious functions among the dhimma community to pay the jizya, while exempting women, children, elders, handicapped, monks, hermits, the poor, the ill, the insane, slaves, as well as musta&#x27;mins (non-Muslim foreigners who only temporarily reside in Muslim lands) and converts to Islam. Dhimmis who chose to join military service were exempted from payment. If anyone could not afford this tax, they would not have to pay anything. Sometimes a dhimmi was exempted from jizya if he rendered some valuable services to the state.

The Hanafi scholar Abu Yusuf wrote, &quot;slaves, women, children, the old, the sick, monks, hermits, the insane, the blind and the poor, were exempt from the tax&quot; and states that jizya should not be collected from those who have neither income nor any property, but survive by begging and from alms. The Hanbali jurist al-Qāḍī Abū Yaʿlā states, &quot;there is no jizya upon the poor, the old, and the chronically ill&quot;. Historical reports tell of exemptions granted by the second caliph &#x27;Umar to an old blind Jew and others like him. The Maliki scholar Al-Qurtubi writes that, &quot;there is a consensus amongst Islamic scholars that jizya is to be taken only from heads of free men past puberty, who are the ones fighting, but not from women, the children, the slaves, the insane, and the dying old.&quot; The 13th century Shafi&#x27;i scholar Al-Nawawī wrote that a &quot;woman, a hermaphrodite, a slave even when partially enfranchised, a minor and a lunatic are exempt from &quot;jizya&quot;.&quot; The 14th century Hanbali scholar Ibn Qayyim wrote, &quot;And there is no Jizya upon the aged, one suffering from chronic disease, the blind, and the patient who has no hope of recovery and has despaired of his health, even if they have enough.&quot; Ibn Qayyim adds, referring to the four Sunni maddhabs: &quot;There is no Jizya on the kids, women and the insane. This is the view of the four imams and their followers. Ibn Mundhir said, &#x27;I do not know anyone to have differed with them.&#x27; Ibn Qudama said in al-Mughni, &#x27;We do not know of any difference of opinion among the learned on this issue.&quot; In contrast, the Shāfi&#x27;ī jurist Al-Nawawī wrote: &quot;Our school insists upon the payment of the poll-tax by sickly persons, old men, even if decrepit, blind men, monks, workmen, and poor persons incapable of exercising a trade. As for people who seem to be insolvent at the end of the year, the sum of the poll tax remained as debt to their account until they should become solvent.&quot; Abu Hanifa, in one of his opinions, and Abu Yusuf held that monks were subject to jizya if they worked. Ibn Qayyim stated that the &quot;dhahir&quot; opinion of Ibn Hanbal is that peasants and cultivators were also exempted from jizya.

Though &quot;jizya&quot; was mandated initially for People of the Book (Judaism, Christianity, Sabianism), it was extended by Islamic jurists to all non-Muslims. Thus Muslim rulers in India, with the exception of Akbar, collected &quot;jizya&quot; from Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs under their rule. While early Islamic scholars like Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf stated that jizya should be imposed on all non-Muslims without distinction, some later and more extremist jurists do not permit jizya for idolators and instead only allowed the choice of conversion to avoid death.

The sources of jizya and the practices varied significantly over Islamic history. Shelomo Dov Goitein states that the exemptions for the indigent, the invalids and the old were no longer observed in the milieu reflected by the Cairo Geniza and were discarded even in theory by the Shāfi&#x27;ī jurists who were influential in Egypt at the time. According to Kristen A. Stilt, historical sources indicate that in Mamluk Egypt, poverty did &quot;not necessarily excuse&quot; the dhimmi from paying the tax, and boys as young as nine years old could be considered adults for tax purposes, making the tax particularly burdensome for large, poor families. Ashtor and Bornstein-Makovetsky infer from Geniza documents that jizya was also collected in Egypt from the age of nine in the 11th century.

===Rate of the jizya tax===
The rates of jizya were not uniform, as Islamic scripture gave no fixed limits to the tax.
By the time of Mohammed, the jiyza rate was one dinar per year imposed on male dhimmis in Medina, Mecca, Khaibar, Yemen, and Nejran. According to Muhammad Hamidullah, the rate was ten dirhams per year &quot;in the time of the Prophet&quot;, but this amounted to only &quot;the expenses of an average family for ten days&quot;. Abu Yusuf, the chief qadhi of the caliph Harun al-Rashid, states that there was no amount permanently fixed for the tax, though the payment usually depended on wealth: the &quot;Kitab al-Kharaj&quot; of Abu Yusuf sets the amounts at 48 dirhams for the richest (e.g. moneychangers), 24 for those of moderate wealth, and 12 for craftsmen and manual laborers. Moreover, it could be paid in kind if desired; cattle, merchandise, household effects, even needles were to be accepted in lieu of specie (coins), but not pigs, wine, or dead animals.

The jizya varied in accordance with the affluence of the people of the region and their ability to pay. In this regard, Abu Ubayd ibn Sallam comments that the Prophet imposed 1 dinar (then worth 10 or 12 dirhams) upon each adult in Yemen. This was less than what Umar imposed upon the people of Syria and Iraq, the higher rate being due to the Yemenis greater affluence and ability to pay.

The rate of jizya that were fixed and implemented by the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, namely &#x27;Umar bin al-Khattab, during the period of his Khilafah, were small amounts: four dirhams from the rich, two dirhams from the middle class and only one dirham from the active poor who earned by working on wages, or by making or vending things.

At least during one period, during the governorship of Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf in Iraq (680-714), the rate of jizya was sufficiently high and more than taxes on Muslims that officials of Al-Hajjaj&#x27;s wrote to warn him that public revenues had greatly diminished because Christians were converting to Islam to avoid paying jizyah.

The 13th-century scholar Al-Nawawī writes, &quot;The minimum amount of the jizya is one dinar per person per annum; but it is commendable to raise the amount, if it be possible to two dinars, for those possessed of moderate means, and to four for rich persons.&quot; Abu &#x27;Ubayd insists that the &quot;dhimmis&quot; must not be burdened beyond their capacity, nor must they be caused to suffer.

Scholar Ibn Qudamah (1147 – 7 July 1223) narrates three views on what the rates of jizya should be.
#That it is a fixed amount that can&#x27;t be changed, a view that is reportedly shared by scholars of fiqh Abu Hanifa and al-Shafi&#x27;i.
#That it is up to the Imam (Muslim ruler) to make ijtihād (independent reasoning) so as to decide whether to add or decrease. He gives the example of &#x27;Umar making particular amounts for each class (the rich, the middle class and the active poor).
#That there should be a strict minimum to be one dinar, but there is no upper limit.

Scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332 – 17 March 1406) states that jizya has fixed limits that cannot be exceeded. In the classical manual of Shafi&#x27;i fiqh &quot;Reliance of the Traveller&quot; it is stated that, &quot;[t]he minimum non-Muslim poll tax is one dinar (n: 4.235 grams of gold) per person (A: per year). The maximum is whatever both sides agree upon.&quot;

===Collection methods===
According to Al-Ghazali jizya was &quot;to establish liberty of conscience in the world&quot; and not for &quot;compelling people to embrace Islam; that would be an unholy war.&quot;

According to Mark R. Cohen, the Quran itself does not prescribe humiliating treatment for the dhimmi when paying Jizya, but some later Muslims interpreted it to contain &quot;an equivocal warrant for debasing the dhimmi (non-Muslim) through a degrading method of remission&quot;. In contrast, the 13th century hadith scholar and Shafi&#x27;ite jurist Al-Nawawī, comments on those who would impose a humiliation along with the paying of the jizya, stating, &quot;As for this aforementioned practice, I know of no sound support for it in this respect, and it is only mentioned by the scholars of Khurasan. The majority of scholars say that the jizya is to be taken with gentleness, as one would receive a debt. The reliably correct opinion is that this practice is invalid and those who devised it should be refuted. It is not related that the Prophet or any of the rightly-guided caliphs did any such thing when collecting the jizya.&quot; Ibn Qudamah also rejected this practice and noted that Muhammad and the Rashidun caliphs encouraged that jizya be collected with gentleness and kindness.

Ann Lambton states that the jizya was to be paid &quot;in humiliating conditions&quot;. Many of the Islamic scholars base this on Surat At-Tawbah 9:29 which states – &quot;(9:29) Those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day – even though they were given the scriptures, and who do not hold as unlawful that which Allah and His Messenger have declared to be unlawful, and who do not follow the true religion – fight against them until they pay tribute out of their hand and are utterly subdued.&quot; Ennaji and other scholars state that some jurists required the jizya to be paid by each in person, by presenting himself, arriving on foot not horseback, by hand, in order to confirm that he lowers himself to being a subjected one, and willingly pays.

[Tafsir ibn &#x27;Ajibah. Commentary on Q9:29. Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Ajibah] &quot;&quot;The dhimmi is commanded to put his soul, good fortune and desires to death. Above all he should kill the love of life, leadership and honor. [The dhimmi] is to invert the longings of his soul, he is to load it down more heavily than it can bear until it is completely submissive. Thereafter nothing will be unbearable for him. He will be indifferent to subjugation or might. Poverty and wealth will be the same to him; praise and insult will be the same; preventing and yielding will be the same; lost and found will be the same. Then, when all things are the same, it [the soul] will be submissive and yield willingly what it should give&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Sufi saint Ahmad Sirhindi (1564–1624), letter #163 &quot;The honour of Islam lies in insulting kufr and kafirs. One who respects the kafirs dishonours the Muslims... The real purpose of levying jiziya on them is to humiliate them to such an extent that they may not be able to dress well and to live in grandeur. They should constantly remain terrified and trembling. It is intended to hold them under contempt and to uphold the honour and might of Islam.&quot;

The Maliki scholar Al-Qurtubi states, &quot;their punishment in case of non-payment [of jizya] while they were able [to do so] is permitted; however, if their inability to pay it was clear then it isn&#x27;t lawful to punish them, since, if one isn&#x27;t able to pay the jizya, then he is exempted&quot;. According to Abu Yusuf, jurist of the fifth Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, those who didn&#x27;t pay jizya should be imprisoned and not be let out of custody until payment; however, the collectors of the jizya were instructed to show leniency and avoid corporal punishment in case of non-payment. If someone had agreed to pay jizya, leaving Muslim territory for enemy land was, in theory, punishable by enslavement if they were ever captured. This punishment did not apply if the person had suffered injustices from Muslims.

Failure to pay the jizya was commonly punished by house arrest and some legal authorities allowed enslavement of dhimmis for non-payment of taxes. In South Asia, for example, seizure of dhimmi families upon their failure to pay annual jizya was one of the two significant sources of slaves sold in the slave markets of Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era.

===Use of tax===
Jizya was considered one of the basic tax revenues for the early Islamic state along with zakat, kharaj, and others. and was collected by the Bayt al-Mal (public treasury). Holger Weiss states that four fifths of the &quot;fay&quot; revenue, jizya and kharaj, goes to the public treasury according to the Shafi&#x27;i madhhab, whereas the Hanafi and Maliki madhhabs state that the entire &quot;fay&quot; goes to the public treasury.

In theory, jizya funds were distributed as salaries for officials, pensions to the army and charity. Cahen states, &quot;But under this pretext it was often paid into the Prince&#x27;s &quot;khass&quot;, &quot;private&quot; treasury.&quot; In later times, jizya revenues were commonly allocated to Islamic scholars so that they would not have to accept money from sultans whose wealth came to be regarded as tainted.

Sources disagree about expenditure of jizya funds on non-Muslims. Ann Lambton states that non-Muslims had no share in the benefits from the public treasury derived from jizya. In contrast, according to several Muslim scholars, Islamic tradition records a number of episodes in which the second caliph, Umar, stipulated for needy and infirm dhimmis to be supported from the Bayt al-Mal, which some authors hold to be representative of Islam. Evidence of jizya benefitting non-residents and temporary residents of an Islamic state is found in the treaty that Khalid bin al-Walid concluded with the people of Al-Hirah of Iraq in which any aged person who was weak, had lost his or her ability to work, fallen ill, or who had been rich but became poor, would be exempt from jiyza and his or livelihood and the livelihood of his or her dependents, who were not living permanently in the Islamic state, would be met by Bayt al-Mal. Hasan Shah states that non-Muslim women, children, the indigent and slaves are exempted from the payment of jizya, and they are also helped by stipends from the public treasury when necessary.

At least in the early Islamic era of the Umayyads, jizya was levy that sufficiently onerous for non-Muslims and its had a sufficiently-significant revenue for rulers that there were more than a few accounts of non-Muslims seeking to convert to avoid paying it and revenue-conscious authorities denying them the opportunity.

Robert Hoyland mentions repeated complaints by fiscal agents of revenues diminishing as conquered people converting to Islam, peasants attempting to convert and join the military but being rounded up and sent back to the countryside to pay taxes and governors circumventing the exemption on jizya for converts by requiring recitation of the Quran and circumcision.

Patricia Seed describes the purpose of jizya as &quot;a personal form of ritual humiliation directed at those defeated by a superior Islam&quot; and quotes the Quranic verse calling for jizya: &quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah... nor acknowledge the religion of truth... until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued&quot;. She notes that the word translated as &quot;subdued&quot;, &quot;ṣāghirūn&quot;, comes from the root &quot;ṣ-gh-r&quot; (&quot;small&quot;, &quot;little&quot;, &quot;belittled&quot; or &quot;humbled&quot;). Seed calls the idea that jizya was a contribution to help pay for the &quot;military defense&quot; of those who paid not a rationale but a rationalisation that was often found in societies in which the conquered paid tribute to conquerors.

==History==

===Origins===
The history of the origins of the jizya is very complex for the following reasons:
* Abbasid authors who systematized earlier historical writings in which the term &quot;jizya&quot; was used with different meanings interpreted it according to the usage common in their own time.
* The system established by the Arab conquest was not uniform but rather resulted from a variety of agreements or decisions.
* The earlier systems of taxation on which it was based are still imperfectly understood.

William Montgomery Watt traces its origin to a pre-Islamic practice among the Arabian nomads in which a powerful tribe would agree to protect its weaker neighbors in exchange for a tribute that would be refunded if the protection proved ineffectual. Robert Hoyland describes it as a poll tax originally paid by &quot;the conquered people&quot; to the mostly-Arab conquerors, but it later became a &quot;religious tax, payable only by non-Muslims&quot;.

Jews and Christians in some southern and eastern areas of the Arabian Peninsula began to pay tribute, called &quot;jizya&quot;, to the Islamic state during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime. It was not originally the poll tax that it would become later but rather an annual percentage of produce and a fixed quantity of goods.

During the Tabuk campaign in 630, Muhammad sent letters to four towns in the northern Hejaz and Palestine to urge them to relinquish maintenance of a military force and rely on Muslims to ensure their security in return for payment of taxes. Moshe Gil argues that the texts represent the paradigm of letters of security that would be issued by Muslim leaders during the subsequent early conquests, including the use of the word jizya, which would later take on the meaning of poll tax.

Jizya received divine sanction in 630, when the term was mentioned in a Quranic verse (9:29). Max Bravmann argues that the Quranic usage of the word &quot;jizya&quot; develops a pre-Islamic common-law principle, which states that reward must necessarily follow a discretional good deed into a principle mandating that the life of all prisoners of war belonging to a certain category must be spared if they grant the &quot;reward&quot; (jizya) to be expected for an act of pardon.

In 632, jizya, in the form of a poll tax, was first mentioned in a document that was reportedly sent by Muhammad to Yemen. W. Montgomery Watt argues that the document was tampered with by early Muslim historians to reflect a later practice, but Norman Stillman holds it to be authentic.

===Emergence of classical taxation system===
Taxes levied on local populations in the wake of early Islamic conquests could be of three types, based on whether they were levied on individuals, on the land, or as collective tribute. During the first century of Islamic expansion, the words &quot;jizya&quot; and &quot;kharaj&quot; were used in all these three senses, with context distinguishing between individual and land taxes (&quot;kharaj on the head,&quot; &quot;jizya on land,&quot; and vice versa). In the words of Dennett, &quot;since we are talking in terms of history, not in terms of philology, the problem is not what the taxes were called, but what we know they were.&quot; Regional variations in taxation at first reflected the diversity of previous systems. The Sasanian Empire had a general tax on land and a poll tax having several rates based on wealth, with an exemption for aristocracy. In Iraq, which was conquered mainly by force, Arabs controlled taxation through local administrators, keeping the graded poll tax, and likely increasing its rates to 1, 2 and 4 dinars. The aristocracy exemption was assumed by the new Arab-Muslim elite and shared by local aristocracy by means of conversion. The nature of Byzantine taxation remains partly unclear, but it appears to have involved taxes computed in proportion to agricultural production or number of working inhabitants in population centers. In Syria and upper Mesopotamia, which largely surrendered under treaties, taxes were calculated in proportion to the number of inhabitants at a fixed rate (generally 1 dinar per head). They were levied as collective tribute in population centers which preserved their autonomy and as a personal tax on large abandoned estates, often paid by peasants in produce. In post-conquest Egypt, most communities were taxed using a system which combined a land tax with a poll tax of 2 dinars per head. Collection of both was delegated to the community on the condition that the burden be divided among its members in the most equitable manner. In most of Iran and Central Asia local rulers paid a fixed tribute and maintained their autonomy in tax collection, using the Sasanian dual tax system in regions like Khorasan.

Difficulties in tax collection soon appeared. Egyptian Copts, who had been skilled in tax evasion since Roman times, were able to avoid paying the taxes by entering monasteries, which were initially exempt from taxation, or simply by leaving the district where they were registered. This prompted imposition of taxes on monks and introduction of movement controls. In Iraq, many peasants who had fallen behind with their tax payments, converted to Islam and abandoned their land for Arab garrison cities in hope of escaping taxation. Faced with a decline in agriculture and a treasury shortfall, the governor of Iraq al-Hajjaj forced peasant converts to return to their lands and subjected them to the taxes again, effectively forbidding peasants to convert to Islam. In Khorasan, a similar phenomenon forced the native aristocracy to compensate for the shortfall in tax collection out of their own pockets, and they responded by persecuting peasant converts and imposing heavier taxes on poor Muslims.

The situation where conversion to Islam was penalized in an Islamic state could not last, and the devout Umayyad caliph Umar II has been credited with changing the taxation system. Modern historians doubt this account, although details of the transition to the system of taxation elaborated by Abbasid-era jurists are still unclear. Umar II ordered governors to cease collection of taxes from Muslim converts, but his successors obstructed this policy. Some governors sought to stem the tide of conversions by introducing additional requirements such as undergoing circumcision and the ability to recite passages from the Quran. According to Hoyland, taxation-related grievances of non-Arab Muslims contributed to the opposition movements which resulted in the Abbasid revolution. In contrast, Dennett states that it is incorrect to postulate an economic interpretation of the Abbasid Revolution. The notion of an Iranian population staggering under a burden of taxation and ready to revolt at the first opportunity, as imagined by Gerlof van Vloten, &quot;will not bear the light of careful investigation&quot;, he continues.

Under the new system that was eventually established, kharaj came to be regarded as a tax levied on the land, regardless of the taxpayer&#x27;s religion. The poll-tax was no longer levied on Muslims, but treasury did not necessarily suffer and converts did not gain as a result, since they had to pay zakat, which was instituted as a compulsory tax on Muslims around 730. The terminology became specialized during the Abbasid era, so that &quot;kharaj&quot; no longer meant anything more than land tax, while the term &quot;jizya&quot; was restricted to the poll-tax on dhimmis.

===India===

In India, Islamic rulers imposed &quot;jizya&quot; on non-Muslims starting with the 11th century. The taxation practice included &quot;jizya&quot; and &quot;kharaj&quot; taxes. These terms were sometimes used interchangeably to mean poll tax and collective tribute, or just called &quot;kharaj-e-jizya&quot;.

Jizya was expanded by the Delhi Sultanate. Alauddin Khilji legalized the enslavement of the jizya and kharaj defaulters. His officials seized and sold these slaves in growing Sultanate cities where there was a great demand of slave labour. The Muslim court historian Ziauddin Barani recorded that Qazi Mughisuddin of Bayanah advised Alā&#x27; al-Dīn that Islam requires imposition of jizya on Hindus, to show contempt and to humiliate the Hindus, and imposing jizya is a religious duty of the Sultan.

During the early 14th century reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, expensive invasions across India and his order to attack China by sending a portion of his army over the Himalayas, emptied the precious metal in the treasury of the Sultanate. He ordered minting of coins from base metals with face value of precious metals. This economic experiment failed because Hindus in his Sultanate minted counterfeit coins from base metal in their homes, which they then used for paying jizya. In the late 14th century, mentions the memoir of Tughlaq dynasty&#x27;s Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq, his predecessor taxed all Hindus but had exempted all Hindu Brahmins from jizya; Firoz Shah extended it to also include the Brahmins at a reduced rate. He also announced that any Hindu who converted to Islam would become exempt from taxes and jizya as well as receive gifts from him. On those who chose to remain Hindus, he raised the jizya tax rate.

In Kashmir, Sikandar Butshikan levied jizya on those who objected to the abolition of hereditary &quot;varnas&quot;, allegedly at the behest of his neo-convert minister Suhabhatta. Ahmad Shah (1411-1442), a ruler of Gujarat, introduced the Jizyah in 1414 and collected it with such strictness that many people converted to Islam to evade it.

Jizya was later abolished by the third Mughal emperor Akbar, in 1564. However, in 1679, Aurangzeb chose to re-impose jizya on non-Muslim subjects in lieu of military service, a move that was sharply critiqued by many Hindu rulers and Mughal court-officials. The specific amount varied with the socioeconomic status of a subject and tax-collection were often waived for regions hit by calamities; also, monks, musta&#x27;mins, women, children, elders, the handicapped, the unemployed, the ill, and the insane were all perpetually exempted. The collectors were mandated to be Muslims. In some areas revolts led to its periodic suspension such as the 1704 AD suspension of jizya in Deccan region of India by Aurangzeb.

===Southern Italy===
After the Norman conquest of Sicily, taxes imposed on the Muslim minority were also called the &quot;jizya&quot; (locally spelled &quot;gisia&quot;). This poll tax was a continuation of the jizya imposed on non-Muslims in the Emirate of Sicily and Bari by Islamic rulers of southern Italy, before the Norman conquest.

===Ottoman Empire===


Jizya collected from Christian and Jewish communities was among the main sources of tax income of the Ottoman treasury. In some regions, such as Lebanon and Egypt, jizya was payable collectively by the Christian or the Jewish community, and was referred to as &quot;maqtu&quot;—in these cases the individual rate of jizya tax would vary, as the community would pitch in for those who could not afford to pay.

The Ottoman state also collected Jizya from Muslim and non-Muslim groups they registered as Gypsy (Kıpti), such as Roma in Western Anatolia and Balkans and Abdals, Doms and Loms in Kastamonu, Çankırı-Tosya, Ankara, Malatya, Harput, Antep, and Aleppo no later than late 17th century. Abdals and Tahtacıs in Teke (Antalya) were affiliated with another fiscal category, ifraz-ı zulkadriyye, until 1858, when the Ottoman reformers incorporated the fixed tax of relevant groups into the Gypsy poll tax 

===Abolition===
In Persia, &quot;jizya&quot; was paid by the Zoroastrian minority until 1884, when it was removed by pressure on the Qajar government from the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund.

The &quot;jizya&quot; was eliminated in Algeria and Tunisia in the 19th century, but continued to be collected in Morocco until the first decade of the 20th century (these three dates of abolition coincide with the French colonization of these countries).

The Ottoman Empire abolished the &quot;jizya&quot; in 1856. It was replaced with a new tax, which non-Muslims paid in lieu of military service. It was called &quot;baddal-askari&quot; (lit. &#x27;military substitution&#x27;), a tax exempting Jews and Christians from military service. The Jews of Kurdistan, according to the scholar Mordechai Zaken, preferred to pay the &quot;baddal&quot; tax in order to redeem themselves from military service. Only those incapable of paying the tax were drafted into the army. Zaken says that paying the tax was possible to an extent also during the war and some Jews paid 50 gold liras every year during World War I. According to Zaken, &quot;in spite of the forceful conscription campaigns, some of the Jews were able to buy their exemption from conscription duty.&quot; Zaken states that the payment of the &quot;baddal askari&quot; during the war was a form of bribe that bought them at most a one-year deferment.&quot;

===Recent times===
The jizya is no longer imposed by Muslim states. Nevertheless, there have been reports of non-Muslims in areas controlled by the Pakistani Taliban and ISIS being forced to pay the jizya.

In 2009, officials in the Peshawar region of Pakistan claimed that members of the Taliban forced the payment of &quot;jizya&quot; from Pakistan&#x27;s minority Sikh community after occupying some of their homes and kidnapping a Sikh leader. In 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) announced that it intended to extract jizya from Christians in the city of Raqqa, Syria, which it controlled.

In June, the Institute for the Study of War reported that ISIL claims to have collected the &quot;fay&quot;, i.e. jizya and kharaj.

The late Islamic scholar Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, of Pakistan, said that Jizya should be re-imposed on non-Muslims in a Muslim nation. Yusuf al-Qaradawi of Egypt also held that position in the mid-1980s; however, he later reconsidered his legal opinion on this point, stating: &quot;[n]owadays, after military conscription has become compulsory for all citizens—Muslims and non-Muslims—there is no longer room for any payment, whether by name of jizya or any other.&quot; According to Khaled Abou El Fadl, moderate Muslims generally reject the dhimma system, which encompasses jizya, as inappropriate for the age of nation-states and democracies.

==Assessment and historical context==
Some authors have characterized the complex of land and poll taxes in the pre-Abbasid era and implementation of the jizya poll tax in early modern South Asia as discriminatory and/or oppressive, and the majority of Islamic scholars, amongst whom are Al-Nawawi and Ibn Qudamah, have criticized humiliating aspects of its collection as contrary to Islamic principles. Discriminatory regulations were utilized by many pre-modern polities. However, W. Cleveland and M. Bunton assert that dhimma status represented &quot;an unusually tolerant attitude for the era and stood in marked contrast to the practices of the Byzantine Empire&quot;. They add that the change from the Byzantine and Persian rule to Arab rule lowered taxes and allowed dhimmis to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy. According to Bernard Lewis, available evidence suggests that the change from Byzantine to Arab rule was &quot;welcomed by many among the subject peoples, who found the new yoke far lighter than the old, both in taxation and in other matters&quot;.

Ira Lapidus writes that the Arab-Muslim conquests followed a general pattern of nomadic conquests of settled regions, whereby conquering peoples became the new military elite and reached a compromise with the old elites by allowing them to retain local political, religious, and financial authority. Peasants, workers, and merchants paid taxes, while members of the old and new elites collected them. Payment of various taxes, the total of which for peasants often reached half of the value of their produce, was not only an economic burden, but also a mark of social inferiority.

Norman Stillman writes that although the tax burden of the Jews under early Islamic rule was comparable to that under previous rulers, Christians of the Byzantine Empire (though not Christians of the Persian empire, whose status was similar to that of the Jews) and Zoroastrians of Iran shouldered a considerably heavier burden in the immediate aftermath of the Arab conquests. He writes that escape from oppressive taxation and social inferiority was a &quot;great inducement&quot; to conversion and flight from villages to Arab garrison towns, and many converts to Islam &quot;were sorely disappointed when they discovered that they were not to be permitted to go from being tribute bearers to pension receivers by the ruling Arab military elite,&quot; before their numbers forced an overhaul of the economic system in the 8th century.

The influence of jizya on conversion has been a subject of scholarly debate. Julius Wellhausen held that the poll tax amounted to so little that exemption from it did not constitute sufficient economic motive for conversion. Similarly, Thomas Arnold states that jizya was &quot;too moderate&quot; to constitute a burden, &quot;seeing that it released them from the compulsory military service that was incumbent on their Muslim fellow subjects.&quot; He further adds that converts escaping taxation would have to pay the legal alms, zakat, that is annually levied on most kinds of movable and immovable property. Other early 20th century scholars suggested that non-Muslims converted to Islam &quot;en masse&quot; in order to escape the poll tax, but this theory has been challenged by more recent research. Daniel Dennett has shown that other factors, such as desire to retain social status, had greater influence on this choice in the early Islamic period. According to Halil İnalcık, the wish to avoid paying the jizya was an important incentive for conversion to Islam in the Balkans, though Anton Minkov has argued that it was only one among several motivating factors.

Mark R. Cohen writes that despite the humiliating connotations and the financial burden, the jizya paid by Jews under Islamic rule provided a &quot;surer guarantee of protection from non-Jewish hostility&quot; than that possessed by Jews in the Latin West, where Jews &quot;paid numerous and often unreasonably high and arbitrary taxes&quot; in return for official protection, and where treatment of Jews was governed by charters which new rulers could alter at will upon accession or refuse to renew altogether. The Pact of Umar, which stipulated that Muslims must &quot;do battle to guard&quot; the dhimmis and &quot;put no burden on them greater than they can bear&quot;, was not always upheld, but it remained &quot;a steadfast cornerstone of Islamic policy&quot; into early modern times.

Yaser Ellethy states that the &quot;insignificant amount&quot; of the jizya, as well as its progressive structure and exemptions leave no doubt that it was not imposed to persecute people or force them to convert. Niaz A. Shah states that &quot;jizya&quot; is &quot;partly symbolic and partly commutation for military service. As the amount is insignificant and exemptions are many, the symbolic nature predominates.&quot; Muhammad Abdel-Haleem states, &quot;[t]he jizya is a very clear example of the acceptance of a multiplicity of cultures within the Islamic system, which allowed people of different faiths to live according to their own faiths, all contributing to the well-being of the state, Muslims through &quot;zakāt&quot;, and the &quot;ahl al-dhimma&quot; through &quot;jizya&quot;.&quot;

In his essay, ethnographer Shelomo Dov Goitein highlighted the limitation of studying the potential economic and other adverse social consequences of the jizya without any reference to non-Muslim sources:
In 2016, Muslim scholars from more than 100 countries signed the Marrakesh Declaration, a document that called for a new Islamic jurisprudence based on the recognition of civic nationalism based governments, implying that the dhimmī system is inapplicable in the modern era in relation to the time of the writing of the Qur&#x27;an.

<text>The term wali is most commonly used by Muslims to refer to a saint, or literally a &quot;friend of God&quot;.

In the traditional Islamic understanding, a saint is portrayed as someone &quot;marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness&quot;, and who is specifically &quot;chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles&quot;. The doctrine of saints was articulated by Muslim scholars very early on in Islamic history, and particular verses of the Quran and certain hadith were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as &quot;documentary evidence&quot; of the existence of saints. Graves of saints around the Muslim world became centers of pilgrimage – especially after 1200 CE – for masses of Muslims seeking their (blessing).
Since the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when the Islamic mystical trend of Sufism began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in orthodox Sunni Islam were the early Sufi mystics, like Hasan of Basra (d. 728), Farqad Sabakhi (d. 729), Dawud Tai (d. 777–781), Rabia of Basra (d. 801), Maruf Karkhi (d. 815), and Junayd of Baghdad (d. 910). From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, &quot;the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism ... into orders or brotherhoods&quot;. In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this period, the saint was understood to be &quot;a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples&quot;. In many prominent Sunni creeds of the time, such as the famous &quot;Creed of Tahawi&quot; () and the &quot;Creed of Nasafi&quot; (), a belief in the existence and miracles of saints was presented as &quot;a requirement&quot; for being an orthodox Muslim believer.

Aside from the Sufis, the preeminent saints in traditional Islamic piety are the Companions of the Prophet, their Successors, and the Successors of the Successors. Additionally, the prophets and messengers in Islam are also believed to be saints by definition, although they are rarely referred to as such, in order to prevent confusion between them and ordinary saints; as the prophets are exalted by Muslims as the greatest of all humanity, it is a general tenet of Sunni belief that a single prophet is greater than all the regular saints put together. In short, it is believed that &quot;every prophet is a saint, but not every saint is a prophet&quot;.

In the modern world, traditional Sunni and Shia ideas of saints has been challenged by fundamentalist and revivalist Islamic movements such as the Salafi movement, Wahhabism, and Islamic Modernism, all three of which have, to a greater or lesser degree, &quot;formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints&quot;. As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements has indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to resist &quot;acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations&quot;. However, despite the presence of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital role in daily expressions of piety among vast segments of Muslim populations in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey, Senegal, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Morocco, as well as in countries with substantial Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the Balkans.

Regarding the rendering of the Arabic &quot;walī&quot; by the English &quot;saint&quot;, prominent scholars such as Gibril Haddad have regarded this as an appropriate translation, with Haddad describing the aversion of some Muslims towards the use of &quot;saint&quot; for &quot;walī&quot; as &quot;a specious objection ... for [this is] – like &#x27;Religion&#x27; (&quot;din&quot;), &#x27;Believer&#x27; (&quot;mu&#x27;min&quot;), &#x27;prayer&#x27; (&quot;salat&quot;), etc. – [a] generic term for holiness and holy persons while there is no confusion, for Muslims, over their specific referents in Islam, namely: the reality of &quot;iman&quot; with Godwariness and those who possess those qualities.&quot; In Persian, which became the second most influential and widely spoken language in the Islamic world after Arabic, the general title for a saint or a spiritual master became &quot;pīr&quot; (, literally &quot;old [person]&quot;, &quot;elder&quot;). Although the ramifications of this phrase include the connotations of a general &quot;saint,&quot; it is often used to specifically signify a spiritual guide of some type.

Amongst Indian Muslims, the title &quot;pīr baba&quot; (पीर बाबा) is commonly used in Hindi to refer to Sufi masters or similarly honored saints. Additionally, saints are also sometimes referred to in the Persian or Urdu vernacular with &quot;Hazrat.&quot; In Islamic mysticism, a &quot;pīr&#x27;s&quot; role is to guide and instruct his disciples on the mystical path. Hence, the key difference between the use of &quot;walī&quot; and &quot;pīr&quot; is that the former does not imply a saint who is also a spiritual master with disciples, while the latter directly does so through its connotations of &quot;elder&quot;. Additionally, other Arabic and Persian words that also often have the same connotations as &quot;pīr&quot;, and hence are also sometimes translated into English as &quot;saint&quot;, include &quot;murshid&quot; (, meaning &quot;guide&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;), &quot;sheikh&quot; and &quot;sarkar&quot; (Persian word meaning &quot;master&quot;).

In the Turkish Islamic lands, saints have been referred to by many terms, including the Arabic &quot;walī&quot;, the Persian &quot;s̲h̲āh&quot; and &quot;pīr&quot;, and Turkish alternatives like &quot;baba&quot; in Anatolia, &quot;ata&quot; in Central Asia (both meaning &quot;father&quot;), and &quot;eren&quot; or &quot;ermis̲h̲&quot; (&lt; ermek &quot;to reach, attain&quot;) or &quot;yati̊r&quot; (&quot;one who settles down&quot;) in Anatolia. Their tombs, meanwhile, are &quot;denoted by terms of Arabic or Persian origin alluding to the idea of pilgrimage (&quot;mazār&quot;, &quot;ziyāratgāh&quot;), tomb (&quot;ḳabr&quot;, &quot;maḳbar&quot;) or domed mausoleum (&quot;gunbad&quot;, &quot;ḳubba&quot;). But such tombs are also denoted by terms usually used for dervish convents, or a particular part of it (&quot;tekke&quot; in the Balkans, &quot;langar&quot;, &#x27;refectory,&#x27; and &quot;ribāṭ&quot; in Central Asia), or by a quality of the saint (&quot;pīr&quot;, &#x27;venerable, respectable,&#x27; in Azerbaijan).&quot;

==History==

According to various traditional Sufi interpretations of the Quran, the concept of sainthood is clearly described. Some modern scholars, however, assert that the Quran does not &quot;explicitly&quot; outline a doctrine or theory of saints. In the Quran, the adjective &quot;walī&quot; is applied to God, in the sense of him being the &quot;friend&quot; of all believers (Q). However, particular Quranic verses were interpreted by early Islamic scholars to refer to a special, exalted group of holy people. These included : &quot;Surely God&#x27;s friends (&quot;awliyāa l-lahi&quot;): no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow,&quot; and , which refers to God&#x27;s love for those who love him. Additionally, some scholars interpreted , &quot;Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger, they are with those unto whom God hath shown favor: the prophets and the &quot;ṣidīqīna&quot; and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they,&quot; to carry a reference to holy people who were not prophets and were ranked below the latter. The word &quot;ṣidīqīna&quot; in this verse literally connotes &quot;the truthful ones&quot; or &quot;the just ones,&quot; and was often interpreted by the early Islamic thinkers in the sense of &quot;saints,&quot; with the famous Quran translator Marmaduke Pickthall rendering it as &quot;saints&quot; in their interpretations of the scripture. Furthermore, the Quran referred to the miracles of saintly people who were not prophets like Khidr () and the People of the Cave (), which also led many early scholars to deduce that a group of venerable people must exist who occupy a rank below the prophets but are nevertheless exalted by God. The references in the corpus of hadith literature to &quot;bona fide&quot; saints like the pre-Islamic Jurayj̲, only lent further credence to this early understanding of saints.

Collected stories about the &quot;lives or &quot;vitae&quot; of the saints&quot;, began to be compiled &quot;and transmitted at an early stage&quot; by many regular Muslim scholars, including Ibn Abi al-Dunya (d. 894), who wrote a work entitled &quot;Kitāb al-Awliyāʾ&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Saints&quot;) in the ninth-century, which constitutes &quot;the earliest [complete] compilation on the theme of God&#x27;s friends.&quot; Prior to Ibn Abi al-Dunya&#x27;s work, the stories of the saints were transmitted through oral tradition; but after the composition of his work, many Islamic scholars began writing down the widely circulated accounts, with later scholars like Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī (d. 948) making extensive use of Ibn Abi al-Dunya&#x27;s work in his own &quot;Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ&quot; (&quot;The Adornment of the Saints&quot;). It is, moreover, evident from the &quot;Kitāb al-Kas̲h̲f wa &#x27;l-bayān&quot; of the early Baghdadi Sufi mystic Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Kharraz (d. 899) that a cohesive understanding of the Muslim saints was already in existence, with al-Kharraz spending ample space distinguishing between the virtues and miracles (&quot;karāmāt&quot;) of the prophets and the saints. The genre of hagiography (&quot;manāḳib&quot;) only became more popular with the passage of time, with numerous prominent Islamic thinkers of the medieval period devoting large works to collecting stories of &quot;various&quot; saints or to focusing upon &quot;the marvelous aspects of the life, the miracles or at least the prodigies of a [specific] Ṣūfī or of a saint believed to have been endowed with miraculous powers.&quot;

In the late ninth-century, important thinkers in Sunni Islam officially articulated the previously-oral doctrine of an entire hierarchy of saints, with the first written account of this hierarchy coming from the pen of al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 907-912). With the general consensus of Islamic scholars of the period accepting that the &quot;ulema&quot; were responsible for maintaining the &quot;exoteric&quot; part of Islamic orthodoxy, including the disciplines of law and jurisprudence, while the Sufis were responsible for articulating the religion&#x27;s deepest inward truths, later prominent mystics like Ibn Arabi (d. 1240) only further reinforced this idea of a saintly hierarchy, and the notion of &quot;types&quot; of saints became a mainstay of Sunni mystical thought, with such types including the &quot;ṣiddīqūn&quot; (&quot;the truthful ones&quot;) and the &quot;abdāl&quot; (&quot;the substitute-saints&quot;), amongst others. Many of these concepts appear in writing far before al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Arabi; the idea of the &quot;abdāl&quot;, for example, appears as early as the &quot;Musnad&quot; of Ibn Hanbal (d. 855), where the word signifies a group of major saints &quot;whose number would remain constant, one always being replaced by some other on his death.&quot; It is, in fact, reported that Ibn Hanbal explicitly identified his contemporary, the mystic Maruf Karkhi (d. 815-20), as one of the &quot;abdal&quot;, saying: &quot;He is one of the substitute-saints, and his supplication is answered.&quot;
From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, &quot;the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism—the mysticism of Islam—into orders or brotherhoods.&quot; In general Islamic piety of the period, the saint was understood to be &quot;a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples.&quot; It was by virtue of his spiritual wisdom that the saint was accorded veneration in medieval Islam, &quot;and it is this which ... [effected] his &#x27;canonization,&#x27; and not some ecclesiastical institution&quot; as in Christianity. In fact, the latter point represents one of the crucial differences between the Islamic and Christian veneration of saints, for saints are venerated by unanimous consensus or popular acclaim in Islam, in a manner akin to all those Christian saints who began to be venerated prior to the institution of canonization. In fact, a belief in the existence of saints became such an important part of medieval Islam that many of the most important creeds articulated during the time period, like the famous &quot;Creed of Tahawi&quot;, explicitly declared it a requirement for being an &quot;orthodox&quot; Muslim to believe in the existence and veneration of saints and in the traditional narratives of their lives and miracles. Hence, we find that even medieval critics of the widespread practice of venerating the tombs of saints, like Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), never denied the existence of saints as such, with the Hanbali jurist stating: &quot;The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur&#x27;an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers.&quot; In the words of one contemporary academic, practically all Muslims of that era believed that &quot;the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable.&quot;

In the modern world, the traditional idea of saints in Islam has been challenged by the puritanical and revivalist Islamic movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, whose influence has &quot;formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints.&quot; For the adherents of Wahhabi ideology, for example, the practice of venerating saints appears as an &quot;abomination&quot;, for they see in this a form of idolatry. It is for this reason that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which adheres to the Wahhabi creed, &quot;destroyed the tombs of saints wherever ... able&quot; during its expansion in the Arabian Peninsula from the eighteenth-century onwards. As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements have indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to also resist &quot;acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.&quot; At the same time, the movement of Islamic Modernism has also opposed the traditional veneration of saints, for many proponents of this ideology regard the practice as &quot;being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.&quot; Despite the presence, however, of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital part in the daily piety of vast portions of Muslim countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey, Senegal, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Morocco, as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the Balkans.

==Definitions==

The general definition of the Muslim saint in classical texts is that he represents a &quot;[friend of God] marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness&quot;, being specifically &quot;chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.&quot; Moreover, the saint is also portrayed in traditional hagiographies as one who &quot;in some way ... acquires his Friend&#x27;s, i.e. God&#x27;s, good qualities, and therefore he possesses particular authority, forces, capacities and abilities.&quot; Amongst classical scholars, Qushayri (d. 1073) defined the saint as someone &quot;whose obedience attains permanence without interference of sin; whom God preserves and guards, in permanent fashion, from the failures of sin through the power of acts of obedience.&quot; Elsewhere, the same author quoted an older tradition in order to convey his understanding of the purpose of saints, which states: &quot;The saints of God are those who, when they are seen, God is remembered.&quot;

Meanwhile, al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 869), the most significant ninth-century expositor of the doctrine, posited six common attributes of true saints (not necessarily applicable to all, according to the author, but nevertheless indicative of a significant portion of them), which are: (1) when people see him, they are automatically reminded of God; (2) anyone who advances towards him in a hostile way is destroyed; (3) he possesses the gift of clairvoyance (&quot;firāsa&quot;); (4) he receives divine inspiration (&quot;ilhām&quot;), to be strictly distinguished from revelation proper (&quot;waḥy&quot;), with the latter being something only the prophets receive; (5) he can work miracles (&quot;karāmāt&quot;) by the leave of God, which may differ from saint to saint, but may include marvels such as walking on water (&quot;al-mas̲h̲y ʿalā &#x27;l-māʾ&quot;) and shortening space and time (&quot;ṭayy al-arḍ&quot;); and (6) he associates with Khidr. Al-Tirmidhi states, furthermore, that although the saint is not sinless like the prophets, he or she can nevertheless be &quot;preserved from sin&quot; (&quot;maḥfūz&quot;) by the grace of God. The contemporary scholar of Sufism Martin Lings described the Islamic saints as &quot;the great incarnations of the Islamic ideal... spiritual giants with which almost every generation was blessed.&quot;

===Classical testimonies===

The doctrine of saints, and of their miracles, seems to have been taken for granted by many of the major authors of the Islamic Golden Age (ca. 700–1400), as well as by many prominent late-medieval scholars. The phenomena in traditional Islam can be at least partly ascribed to the writings of many of the most prominent Sunni theologians and doctors of the classical and medieval periods, many of whom considered the belief in saints to be &quot;orthodox&quot; doctrine. Examples of classical testimonies include:

* &quot;God has saints (&quot;awliyā&quot;) whom He has specially distinguished by His friendship and whom He has chosen to be the governors of His kingdom… He has made the saints governors of the universe… Through the blessing of their advent the rain falls from heaven, and through the purity of their lives the plants spring up from the earth, and through their spiritual influence the Muslims gain victories over the truth concealers&quot; (Hujwiri [d. 1072-7]; Sunni Hanafi jurist and mystic)
* &quot;The miracles of the saints (&quot;awliyā&quot;) are a reality. The miracle appears on behalf of the saint by way of contradicting the customary way of things... And such a thing is reckoned as an evidentiary miracle on behalf of the Messenger to one of whose people this act appears, because it is evident from it that he is a saint, and he could never be a saint unless he were right in his religion; and his religion is the confession of the message of the Messenger&quot; (al-Nasafī [d. 1142], &quot;Creed&quot; XV; Sunni Hanafi theologian)
* &quot;The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The Qur&#x27;an has pointed to it in different places, and the Hadith of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators&quot; (Ibn Taymiyya [d. 1328], &quot;Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya&quot;; Sunni Hanbali theologian and jurisconsult)

===Seeking of blessings===
The rationale for veneration of deceased saints by pilgrims in an appeal for blessings (&quot;Barakah&quot;) even though the saints will not rise from the dead until the Day of Resurrection (&quot;Yawm ad-Dīn&quot;) may come from the hadith that states &quot;the Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray&quot;. (According to the Islamic concept of Punishment of the Grave—established by hadith—the dead are still conscious and active, with the wicked suffering in their graves as a prelude to hell and the pious at ease.) According to Islamic historian Jonathan A.C. Brown, &quot;saints are thought to be no different&quot; than prophets, &quot;as able in death to answer invocations for assistance&quot; as they were while alive.

==Types and hierarchy==

Saints were envisaged to be of different &quot;types&quot; in classical Islamic tradition. Aside from their earthly differences as regard their temporal duty (i.e. jurist, hadith scholar, judge, traditionist, historian, ascetic, poet), saints were also distinguished cosmologically as regards their celestial function or standing. In Islam, however, the saints are represented in traditional texts as serving separate celestial functions, in a manner similar to the angels, and this is closely linked to the idea of a celestial hierarchy in which the various types of saints play different roles. A fundamental distinction was described in the ninth century by al-Tirmidhi in his &quot;Sīrat al-awliyāʾ&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Saints&quot;), who distinguished between two principal varieties of saints: the &quot;walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh&quot; on the one hand and the &quot;walī Allāh&quot; on the other. According to the author, &quot;the [spiritual] ascent of the &quot;walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh&quot; must stop at the end of the created cosmos ... he can attain God&#x27;s proximity, but not God Himself; he is only admitted to God&#x27;s proximity (&quot;muḳarrab&quot;). It is the &quot;walī Allāh&quot; who reaches God. Ascent beyond God&#x27;s throne means to traverse consciously the realms of light of the Divine Names... When the &quot;walī Allāh&quot; has traversed all the realms of the Divine Names, i.e. has come to know God in His names as completely as possible, he is then extinguished in God&#x27;s essence. His soul, his ego, is eliminated and ... when he acts, it is God Who acts through him. And so the state of extinction means at the same time the highest degree of activity in this world.&quot;

Although the doctrine of the hierarchy of saints is already found in written sources as early as the eighth-century, it was al-Tirmidhi who gave it its first systematic articulation.
According to the author, forty major saints, whom he refers to by the various names of &quot;ṣiddīḳīn&quot;, &quot;abdāl&quot;, &quot;umanāʾ&quot;, and &quot;nuṣaḥāʾ&quot;, were appointed after the death of Muhammad to perpetuate the knowledge of the divine mysteries vouchsafed to them by the prophet. These forty saints, al-Tirmidhi stated, would be replaced in each generation after their earthly death; and, according to him, &quot;the fact that they exist is a guarantee for the continuing existence of the world.&quot; Among these forty, al-Tirmidhi specified that seven of them were especially blessed. Despite their exalted nature, however, al-Tirmidhi emphasized that these forty saints occupied a rank below the prophets. Later important works which detailed the hierarchy of saints were composed by the mystic ʿAmmār al-Bidlīsī (d. between 1194 and 1207), the spiritual teacher of Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1220), and by Ruzbihan Baqli (d. 1209), who evidently knew of &quot;a highly developed hierarchy of God&#x27;s friends.&quot; The differences in terminology between the various celestial hierarchies presented by these authors were reconciled by later scholars through their belief that the earlier mystics had highlighted particular parts and different aspects of a single, cohesive hierarchy of saints.

===Sufism===
The goal of the Sufi path is to achieve unification of the self with God (&quot;fanāʾ&quot;). The concept is often described in Sufi allegories as the self mirroring the light of God. Accordingly, the soul is tainted and in need of purification. In the purified state of the Sufi saint, the Sufi&#x27;s spotless mind realizes that it has no real existence in itself; his existence is only God&#x27;s light and he is only the mirror.

In certain esoteric teachings of Islam, there is said to be a cosmic spiritual hierarchy whose ranks include &quot;walis&quot; (saints, friends of God), &quot;abdals&quot; (changed ones), headed by a &quot;ghawth&quot; (helper) or &quot;qutb&quot; (pole, axis). The details vary according to the source.

One source is the 12th Century Persian Ali Hujwiri. In his divine court, there are three hundred &quot;akhyār&quot; (&quot;excellent ones&quot;), forty &quot;abdāl&quot; (&quot;substitutes&quot;), seven &quot;abrār&quot; (&quot;piously devoted ones&quot;), four &quot;awtād&quot; (&quot;pillars&quot;), three &quot;nuqabā&quot; (&quot;leaders&quot;) and one qutb.

All these saints know one another and cannot act without mutual consent. It is the task of the Awtad to go round the whole world every night, and if there should be any place on which their eyes have not fallen, next day some flaw will appear in that place, and they must then inform the Qutb in order that he may direct his attention to the weak spot and that by his blessings the imperfection may be remedied.

Another is from Ibn Arabi, who lived in Moorish Spain. It has a more exclusive structure. There are eight &quot;nujabā&quot; (&quot;nobles&quot;), twelve &quot;nuqabā&quot;, seven &quot;abdāl&quot;, four &quot;awtād&quot;, two &quot;a&#x27;immah&quot; (&quot;guides&quot;), and the qutb.

According to the 20th-century Sufi Inayat Khan, there are seven degrees in the hierarchy. In ascending order, they are pir, buzurg, wali, ghaus, qutb, nabi and rasul He does not say how the levels are populated. Pirs and buzurgs assist the spiritual progress of those who approach them. Walis may take responsibility for protecting a community and generally work in secret. Qutbs are similarly responsible for large regions. Nabis are charged with bringing a reforming message to nations or faiths, and hence have a public role. Rasuls likewise have a mission of transformation of the world at large.

==Regional veneration==
The amount of veneration a specific saint received varied from region to region in Islamic civilization, often on the basis of the saint&#x27;s own history in that region. While the veneration of saints played a crucial role in the daily piety of Sunni Muslims all over the Islamic world for more than a thousand years (ca. 800–1800), exactly &quot;which&quot; saints were most widely venerated in any given cultural climate depended on the hagiographic traditions of that particular area. Thus, while Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236), for example, was honored throughout the Sunni world in the medieval period, his &quot;cultus&quot; was especially prominent in the Indian subcontinent, as that is where he was believed to have preached, performed the majority of his miracles, and ultimately settled at the end of his life.

===North Africa===
The veneration of saints has played an essential role in the religious and social life of the Maghreb for about 1000 years; in other words, since Islam first reached the lands of North Africa in the eighth century. The first written references to ascetic Muslim saints in Africa, &quot;popularly admired and with followings,&quot; appear in tenth-century hagiographies. As has been noted by scholars, however, &quot;the phenomenon may well be older,&quot; for many of the stories of the Islamic saints were passed down orally before finally being put to writing. One of the most widely venerated saints in early North African Islamic history was Abū Yaʿzā (or Yaʿazzā, d. 1177), an illiterate Sunni Maliki miracle worker whose reputation for sanctity was admired even in his own life. Another immensely popular saint of the time-period was Ibn Ḥirzihim (d. 1163), who also gained renown for his personal devoutness and his ability to work miracles. It was Abu Madyan (d. 1197), however, who eventually became one of the &quot;Awliya Allah&quot; of the entire Maghreb. A &quot;spiritual disciple of these two preceding saints,&quot; Abū Madyan, a prominent Sunni Maliki scholar, was the first figure in Maghrebi Sufism &quot;to exercise an influence beyond his own region.&quot; Abū Madyan travelled to the East, where he is said to have met prominent mystics like the Hanbali jurist Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. 1166). Upon returning to the Maghreb, Abū Madyan stopped at Béjaïa and &quot;formed a circle of disciples.&quot; Abū Madyan eventually died in Tlemcen, while making his way to the Almohad court of Marrakesh; he was later venerated as a prime &quot;Awliya Allah&quot; of Tlemcen by popular acclaim.

One of Abū Madyan&#x27;s most notable disciples was ʿAbd al-Salām Ibn Mas̲h̲īs̲h̲ (d. 1127), a &quot;saint ... [who] had a posthumous fame through his being recognised as a master and a &#x27;pole&#x27; by&quot; Abu &#x27;l-Ḥasan al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī (d. 1258). It was this last figure who became &quot;the&quot; preeminent saint in Maghrebi piety, due to his being the founder of one of the most famous Sunni Sufi orders of North Africa: the Shadhiliyya &quot;tariqa&quot;. Adhering to the Maliki &quot;maddhab&quot; in its jurisprudence, the Shadhili order produced numerous widely honored Sunni saints in the intervening years, including Fāsī Aḥmad al-Zarrūq (d. 1494), who was educated in Egypt but taught in Libya and Morocco, and Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Jazūlī (d. 1465), &quot;who returned to Morocco after a long trip to the East and then began a life as a hermit,&quot; and who achieved widespread renown for the miracles he is said to have wrought by the leave of God. Eventually, the latter was buried in Marrakesh, where he ended up becoming of the city&#x27;s seven most famous &quot;Awliya Allah&quot; for the Sunnis of the area. Some of the most popular and influential Maghrebi saints and mystics of the following centuries were Muḥammad b. Nāṣir (d. 1674), Aḥmad al-Tij̲ānī (d. 1815), Abū Ḥāmid al-ʿArabī al-Darqāwī (d. 1823), and Aḥmad b. ʿAlāwī (d. 1934), with the latter three originating Sufi orders of their own. Famous adherents of the Shadhili order amongst modern Islamic scholars include Abdallah Bin Bayyah (b. 1935), Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki (d. 2004), Hamza Yusuf (b. 1958), and Muhammad al-Yaqoubi (b. 1963).

The veneration of saints in Maghrebi Sunni Islam has been studied by scholars with regard to the various &quot;types&quot; of saints venerated by Sunnis in those areas. These include:

* (1) the &quot;pure, ascetic hermit,&quot; who is honored for having refused all ostentation, and is commemorated not on account of his written works but by virtue of the reputation he is believed to have had for personal sanctity, miracles, and &quot;inward wisdom or gnosis&quot;;
* (2) &quot;the ecstatic and eccentric saint&quot; (&quot;mad̲j̲d̲h̲ūb&quot;), who is believed to have maintained orthodoxy in his fulfillment of the pillars of the faith, but who is famous for having taught in an unusually direct style or for having divulged the highest truths before the majority in a manner akin to Hallaj (d. 922). Famous and widely venerated saints of this &quot;type&quot; include Ibn al-Marʾa (d. 1214), ʿAlī al-Ṣanhāj̲ī (ca. 16th-century), ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Mad̲j̲d̲h̲ūb (literally &quot;ʿAbd al-Raḥmān the Ecstatic&quot;, d. 1569);
* (3) the &quot;warrior saint&quot; (pl. &quot;murābiṭūn&quot;) or martyr;
* (4) female saints, who may belong to one of the aforementioned three categories or some other. It has been remarked that &quot;Maghrebi sainthood is by no means confined to men, and ... some of the tombs of female saints are very frequently visited.&quot;
* (5) &quot;Jewish saints&quot;, that is to say, venerable Jewish personages whose tombs are frequented by Sunni Muslims in the area for the seeking of blessings

Regarding the veneration of saints amongst Sunni Muslims in the Maghreb in the present day, scholars have noted the presence of many &quot;thousands of minor, local saints whose tombs remain visible in villages or the quarters of towns.&quot; Although many of these saints lack precise historiographies or hagiographies, &quot;their presence and their social efficacity ... [are] immense&quot; in shaping the spiritual life of Muslims in the region. For the vast majority of Muslims in the Maghreb even today, the saints remain &quot;very much alive at their tomb, to the point that the person&#x27;s name most often serves to denote the place.&quot; While this classical type of Sunni veneration represents the most widespread stance in the area, the modern influence of Salafism and Wahhabism have challenged the traditional practice in some quarters.

===Anatolia, the Balkans, and Caucasus===
Scholars have noted the tremendously &quot;important role&quot; the veneration of saints has historically played in Islamic life all these areas, especially amongst Sunni Muslims who frequent the many thousands of tombs scattered throughout the region for blessings in performing the act of &quot;ziyāra&quot;. According to scholars, &quot;between the Turks of the Balkans and Anatolia, and those in Central Asia, despite the distance separating them, the concept of the saint and the organisation of pilgrimages displays no fundamental differences.&quot; The veneration of Muslim saints really spread in Turkic-inhabited lands from the 10th to the 14th centuries, and played a crucial role in medieval Turkic Sunni piety not only in cosmopolitan cities but also &quot;in rural areas and amongst nomads of the whole Turkish world.&quot; One of the reasons proposed by scholars for the popularity of Muslim saints in pre-modern Turkey is that Islam was majorly spread by the early Sunni Sufis in Turkic-inhabited lands, rather than by purely exoteric teachers. Most of the Muslim saints venerated in Turkey belonged to the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence.

As scholars have noted, Muslim saints venerated in traditional Turkish Sunni Islam may be classified into three principal categories:
* (1) The &quot;g̲h̲āzīs&quot; or early Muslims saints who preached the faith in the region and were often martyred for their religion. Some of the most famous and widely venerated saints of this category include Muhammad&#x27;s companion Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī (d. 674), who was killed beneath the walls of Constantinople and was honored as a martyr shortly thereafter, and Sayyid Baṭṭāl G̲h̲āzī (d. ninth-century), who fought the Christians in Anatolia during the Umayyad period.
* (2) Sufi saints, who were most often Sunni mystics who belonged to the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence and were attached to one of the orthodox Sufi orders like the Naqshbandi or the Mevlevi.
* (3) The &quot;greats figures of Islam&quot;, both pre-Islamic and those who came after Muhammad, as well as certain sainted rulers.

==Reverence of Awliya Allah==
Reverence for Awliya Allah have been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic tradition that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages. With regard to the sheer omnipresence of this belief, the late Martin Lings wrote: &quot;There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint.&quot; As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, the &quot;Awliya Allah&quot; are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration. Traditionally, it has been understood that the &quot;Wali&#x27;Allah&quot; of a particular place prays for that place&#x27;s well-being and for the health and happiness of all who live therein. Here is a partial list of Muslim &quot;Awliya Allah&quot;:

<doc id="274741" wikidata="Q714997" url="?curid=274741" title="Statler and Waldorf">
<text>Statler and Waldorf are a pair of Muppet characters from the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, best known for their cantankerous opinions and shared penchant for heckling. The two elderly men first appeared in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1975, where they consistently jeered the entirety of the cast and their performances from their box seats.

Created by Jim Henson, the characters have been performed by numerous puppeteers, including Henson, in a variety of films and television productions within the Muppet franchise. Statler and Waldorf are named after two landmark New York City hotels, the Statler Hilton and the Waldorf-Astoria (in turn named after Ellsworth Milton Statler and the hometown of the Astor family).

== Characters ==

The characters are known for their heckling. In &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the two are always criticizing Fozzie Bear&#x27;s humor, except for one occasion when Fozzie heckles them back. In contrast, they find &quot;themselves&quot; vastly entertaining and inevitably burst into mutual laughter at their own witticisms. It is later revealed in the &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; special that the two hecklers are friends with Fozzie&#x27;s mother, Emily Bear. Despite constantly complaining about the show and how terrible some acts are, they always return for the following week and occupy their usual box seats. Their reasons for doing so are a mystery even to them, according to one version of the &quot;Muppet Show&quot; theme (Waldorf: &quot;Why do we always come here?&quot; / Statler: &quot;I guess we&#x27;ll never know&quot;).

They also have a predisposition for breaking the fourth wall. Author Ben Underwood remarked on how the characters generally &quot;blur the boundary between performer and audience&quot;, as they are &quot;concurrently audience members and performers&quot;. Underwood points to a second season incident in which the characters see themselves watching the Muppets, with Statler skeptical, saying &quot;No one would watch junk like that&quot;.

== History ==

The puppets were designed by Bonnie Erickson. They were named after two historic New York City hotels, the Statler Hilton and the Waldorf-Astoria.

In &quot;Sex and Violence&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Statler and Waldorf were performed by Jerry Nelson and Jim Henson, respectively. Nelson was unavailable for the first few weeks of production on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. As a result, Richard Hunt took on the role of Statler. Hunt and Henson would continue to perform the two characters until Henson&#x27;s death in 1990. To portray the characters, Hunt and Henson shared very close space, often for hours at a time.

Beginning with &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; (1992), Statler and Waldorf were performed by Jerry Nelson and Dave Goelz, respectively. When Jerry Nelson left the Muppets, citing health reasons, Muppeteer Steve Whitmire took over as Statler. The two were occasionally performed by Drew Massey (Statler) and Victor Yerrid (Waldorf) in 2005 and 2006, most notably in the web series &quot;Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony&quot;. Kevin Clash filled in for Goelz as Waldorf in a few episodes of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;.

In 2017, Whitmire departed from the &quot;Muppets&quot; franchise, including the part of Statler, after being unwillingly dismissed from the part of Kermit the Frog in October 2016. While Matt Vogel was announced for the replacement for Kermit, Peter Linz had already replaced Whitmire as the voice of Statler in advertisements.

== Appearances ==

Statler and Waldorf also appeared (as adults) in the Saturday morning animated television series &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. Both characters were voiced by Dave Coulier.

In &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, they played the ghosts of Jacob and Robert Marley. Whereas the novel &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; features only a Jacob Marley, creating a Robert allowed for including the two Muppets, and possibly also references Bob Marley. When Ebenezer Scrooge, played by Michael Caine, accuses them of always criticizing him, they reply &quot;We were always &quot;heckling&quot; you.&quot; In &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;, they were the figureheads of the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;. Statler complains about being stuck on the front of the ship, to which Waldorf replies it is better than being in the audience.

In the 1996 series &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, based on a television rather than theatre show, Statler and Waldorf were shown watching the show at an assisted living facility, still making disparaging remarks. The duo are featured characters at Disney&#x27;s &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios as audio-animatronic Muppets helping Bean Bunny escape the theater and, of course, heckling the show. They also make a cameo appearance in Pixar&#x27;s 2008 short film &quot;Presto&quot;, where they can be seen in their theater box.

&quot;The Muppet Newsflash: A Jim Henson News Blog&quot; announced on September 17, 2009, that Statler and Waldorf would release a book titled &quot;From the Balcony&quot; in 2010. However, the book was never released.

Statler and Waldorf appear in featured roles in &quot;The Muppets&quot; film. They are shown in Kermit&#x27;s old office where they inform evil oil baron Tex Richman that the only thing that could stop his purchase of The Muppet Theater would be Kermit raising $10 million. They appear during one scene of the 2014 sequel &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;. When the Muppets arrive in Berlin to perform at a run-down cabaret theater, marked by a sign reading &quot;Die Muppets&quot; (&quot;The Muppets&quot; in German), the two joke as to whether this is an early review or a suggestion. This scene is presented in the &quot;Statler and Waldorf Cut&quot; of the film in its home video release.

They appear as audience members in &quot;The Muppets&quot; TV series. The episode &quot;Pig Out&quot; features a B-plot focusing on Statler without Waldorf. They also appear on &quot;Muppets Now&quot;.

=== &quot;From the Balcony&quot; ===

&quot;Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony&quot; is a multi-award-winning web show which ran biweekly on Movies.com from June 2005 until September 2006. The series spawned more than 35 episodes and featured many Muppet characters, both well-known classics and newly created characters. The two elderly would discuss upcoming films, watch the latest movie trailers and share the week&#x27;s &quot;balconism&quot; from their theater box.

=== Guest appearances ===

* Both made an appearance in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #74. In this issue, Spider-Man teams up with the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to battle the Silver Samurai. Statler and Waldorf appear in typical style as hecklers on a balcony.
* Both made an appearance in the 2012 final chapter of &quot;Major League Chew&quot;, set in the Image Universe.
* They appear at the end of Weezer&#x27;s video for the song &quot;&#x27;Keep Fishin&#x27;&quot;. They comment that the performance was not half bad, before adding that it was all bad.
* On the song &quot;The Black Hole&quot; by HORSE the band, the track ends with Statler and Waldorf celebrating the song and then talking themselves into decrying it as &quot;terrible&quot;.
* On September 18, 2009, Statler and Waldorf were shown in a routine on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; called &quot;Statler and Waldorf Heckle Obama&quot;, consisting of a video recording of President Barack Obama at a health care rally, with old &quot;Muppet Show&quot; clips of Statler and Waldorf interspersed within it.
* Statler and Waldorf are feature characters in the 2011 movie &quot;The Muppets&quot;. To promote the film, they also appeared with several other Muppets on the 2011 Halloween episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, with the duo offering their usual commentary from a skybox.
* The pair make occasional cameos in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, such as heckling &quot;Lost&quot; after Peter builds a balcony in his living room (&quot;Petergeist&quot;) or a cutaway where Statler is shown without Waldorf and realises he enjoys the show without &quot;the other guy&quot; there to egg him on (&quot;Jerome is the New Black&quot;).
* The pair also appeared &quot;via satellite&quot; as BFCA critics at the 2012 Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards on January 12, 2012.
* Statler and Waldorf appeared several times from the balcony to critique the performers at The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball 2012 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 4, 2012.
* Statler and Waldorf also appeared at The Game Awards 2024 to heckle the presenter, Geoff Keighley, during his announcement speech.

== Reception ==

In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Hadley Freeman wrote &quot;Not even celebrity guest Milton Berle could compete with their sharp banter. My heroes&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Esquire&quot;″s Nick Schager named them one of The 10 Most Entertaining Fictional Critics, writing &quot;the funniest Muppets characters have always been Statler and Waldorf&quot;. In 2015, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; identified Statler and Waldorf as popular Muppets, and said to the fans who love them above others, &quot;You know the best way to cope with life&#x27;s difficulties is by laughing at someone else&#x27;s expense&quot;.

Commentators sometimes make comparisons between people and Statler and Waldorf in attention to, or preoccupation with, details, &quot;loud&quot; opinion, or &quot;cantankerous&quot; personality. In 2012, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; described the United Kingdom as &quot;at best spectators in the gallery, like Statler and Waldorf&quot;, within Europe, drawing the ire of British media.

<doc id="274745" wikidata="Q7374226" url="?curid=274745" title="Royal Gorge">
<text>The Royal Gorge is a canyon of the Arkansas River located west of Cañon City, Colorado. The canyon begins at the mouth of Grape Creek, about west of central Cañon City, and continues in a west-northwesterly direction for approximately until ending near U.S. Route 50. Being one of the deepest canyons in Colorado, it is also known as the Grand Canyon of the Arkansas (River), with a maximum depth of . The canyon is also very narrow, measuring from wide at its base to wide at its top, as it carves a path through the granite formations below Fremont Peak and YMCA Mountain, which rise above the north and south rims, respectively.

==Natural history==

The path of the Arkansas River was already set when the granite uplift that would eventually form the Rocky Mountains began. About 3 million years ago, as the mountains began to rise from the surrounding plains, the Arkansas Riverthen only a small streambegan to wear away at the stone it flowed across. Scientists estimate that the mountains surrounding the canyon rose at a rate of approximately one foot every 2500 years. Over the millennia, this small stream grew, cutting a deep channel for itself through the surrounding granite. The gorge&#x27;s peculiar shape, contrasted to broad canyons such as the Grand Canyon, can be attributed to this long, direct erosion through hard rock.

==Early history and European settlement==
Before European settlement, Native Americans of the Ute people wintered in Royal Gorge for its protection from wind and its relatively mild climate. The Comanche, Kiowa, Sioux and Cheyenne used Royal Gorge on buffalo hunting expeditions as an access point to mountain meadow regions such as South Park Basin. Colorado&#x27;s Rocky Mountain region fell under Spanish claims, and conquistador expeditions of the 17th century or fur traders may have seen Royal Gorge in their traversal of the area. The first recorded instance of a European arrival, however, is the Pike Expedition of 1806. Zebulon Pike&#x27;s group built a crude shelter in the gorge and explored the area, descending on horseback over the frozen Arkansas River.

Nearby Cañon City was founded in 1860 to exploit possible mineral deposits in the area. Discovery of silver and lead near Leadville in 1877 prompted a race to build rail access to the area. Royal Gorge was a bottleneck along the Arkansas too narrow for both the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad to pass through, and there was no other reasonable access to the South Park area. Both railroads thus took to fighting the &quot;Royal Gorge Railroad War&quot;, two years of essentially low-level guerrilla warfare between the two companies. Federal intervention prompted the so-called &quot;Treaty of Boston&quot; to end the struggle. The D&amp;RGW completed its line and leased it for use by the Santa Fe.

In the 1890s Royal Gorge was used as a passenger route for transcontinental rail travel. As many as four trains per day went through the gorge, though in time the establishment of alternate routes through the mountains made the Royal Gorge fall from favor for transcontinental use, and passenger train service on the main line was discontinued in 1967. A sightseeing train now follows the route through the gorge.

==Modern history==
On May 7, 1879, the first excursion train traveled through the Royal Gorge after years of court battles between the Denver &amp; Rio Grande and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe (AT&amp;SF or Santa Fe) railroads.

The Royal Gorge Route Railroad now operates excursion trains through the Royal Gorge throughout the year. The train travels 11 miles through the canyon from Cañon City, Colorado to the caretakers house.

In 1906 Guy U. Hardy, a local newspaper editor and future Congressman, lobbied to establish an park at Royal Gorge by having the land ceded to the City of Cañon City. Royal Gorge Park was then created.

In 1929 Cañon City authorized the building of the Royal Gorge Bridge, which at above the river held the record of highest bridge in the world from 1929 to 2001. The bridge is the centerpiece of Royal Gorge Bridge and Park, an amusement park with rides and attractions on both sides of the gorge. The land and bridge are owned by the city and leased to a Dallas-based company called the &quot;Royal Gorge Bridge Company&quot; which has held the leasing rights since 1947. Another Dallas-based company called &quot;Leisure and Recreational Concepts&quot; was hired by the Royal Gorge Bridge Company in 1984 to handle daily operations of the park.

In the movie Sensations of 1945, Hubert Castle plays the role of Olaf, “The Great Gustafson,” who performs a high-wire publicity stunt above the canyon. It is notable that Cañon City’s own Bird Millman never did attempt such a feat herself.

In 1948, images from the park appeared in Canon City (film), which is based on the true story of a prison break.

In 1955, portions of the film &quot;Big House, U.S.A.&quot;, starring Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Lon Chaney Jr., William Talman, Charles Bronson and Felicia Farr (credited as Randy Farr), were filmed in Royal Gorge Park and Cañon City.
On June 11, 2013, a wildfire broke out near the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park which ultimately destroyed 48 of 52 buildings in the park on both sides of the gorge. The bridge was only lightly damaged, with some scorched planks requiring replacement. The park was rebuilt and opened once again on August 30, 2014.

In the summer months, rafting is a very popular activity in the Royal Gorge. Tourists travel from around the world to tackle the Class IV rapids of the Arkansas River and enjoy the scenery of the gorge. Named rapids in the gorge include Sunshine Falls, Sledgehammer, Wallslammer, Corkscrew, the Narrows, Boateater and Soda Pop Rock. River recreation in the gorge is regulated by the Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area (AHRA) and daily user fees are required to launch at all of the recreation sites upstream of the gorge. There are many commercial rafting companies which are licensed by the AHRA to run the gorge and summer weekends can see hundreds of rafts packing the river.

BASE jumping, bungee jumping and rock climbing are generally not permitted at the Royal Gorge. Occasionally, during special events such as the &quot;GoFast Games&quot;, bridge jumps have been allowed by the city and the lessee of the bridge and park.

The cost of admission has increased over the years. In 2023, the price was USD$32 for adults, USD$27 for age 3 to 11.

<text>The decimetre (or  in American English; symbol: dm), is a unit of length in the International System of Units, equal to one tenth of a metre, ten centimetres, one hundred millimetres, and 3.937 inches.

The common non-SI metric unit of volume, the litre, is defined as one cubic decimetre, although, from 1901 to 1964, there was a slight difference between the two due to the litre being defined using the kilogram rather than the metre.

Markings of a ship&#x27;s draft are shown in decimeters in most of the world.

<text>The Al-Azhar University ( ; , , ) is a public university in Cairo, Egypt. Associated with Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Islamic Cairo, it is Egypt&#x27;s oldest degree-granting university and is known as one of the most prestigious universities for Islamic learning. In addition to higher education, Al-Azhar oversees a national network of schools with approximately two million students. over 4,000 teaching institutes in Egypt were affiliated with the university.

Founded in 970 or 972 by the Fatimid Caliphate as a centre of Islamic learning, its students studied the Qur&#x27;an and Islamic law, along with logic, grammar, rhetoric, and how to calculate the phases of the moon. Today it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Islamic learning in the world. In 1961 additional non-religious subjects were added to its curriculum.

Its library is considered second in importance in Egypt only to the Egyptian National Library and Archives. In May 2005, Al-Azhar in partnership with a Dubai information technology enterprise, IT Education Project (ITEP) launched the H.H. Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum project to preserve Al-Azhar scripts and publish them online (the &quot;Al-Azhar Online Project&quot;) to eventually publish online access to the library&#x27;s entire rare manuscripts collection, comprising about seven million pages of material.

==History==

=== Beginnings under the Fatimids ===

Al-Azhar is one of the relics of the Isma&#x27;ili Shi&#x27;a Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descent from Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad and wife of Ali, son-in-law, and cousin of Muhammad. Fatimah was called &quot;al-Zahra&quot; (the luminous), and the institution was named in her honor. It was founded as a mosque by the Fatimid commander Jawhar al-Siqilli at the orders of the Caliph and Imam Al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah as he founded the city for Cairo. It was begun (probably on Saturday) in Jumada al-Awwal in the year AH 359 (March/April 970 CE). Its building was completed on the 9th of Ramadan in AH 361 (24 June 972 CE). Both Caliph al-Aziz Billah and Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah added to its premises. It was further repaired, renovated, and extended by al-Mustansir Billah and al-Hafiz li-Din Allah.

The Fatimid caliphs always encouraged scholars and jurists to have their study-circles and gatherings in this mosque and thus it was turned into a madrasa which has the claim to be considered as the oldest such institution still functioning. The mosque provided teaching on a variety of subjects from a variety of scholars. According to Syed Farid Alatas, these subjects included Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, Islamic philosophy, and logic. Under the Fatimids, Al-Azhar also notably promoted Shia Islam.

=== Saladin ===
In the 12th century, following the overthrow of the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid dynasty, Saladin (the founder of the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty) converted Al-Azhar to a Shafi&#x27;ite Sunni center of learning. Therefore, &quot;he had all the treasures of the palace, including the books, sold over a period of ten years. Many were burned, thrown into the Nile, or thrown into a great heap, which was covered with sand, so that a regular &quot;hill of books&quot; was formed and the soldiers used to sole their shoes with the fine bindings. The number of books said to have been disposed of varies from 120,000 to 2,000,000.&quot; Abd-el-latif delivered lectures on Islamic medicine at Al-Azhar, while according to legend the Jewish philosopher Maimonides delivered lectures on medicine and astronomy there during the time of Saladin though no historical proof has corroborated this.

Saladin introduced the college system in Egypt, which was also adopted in Al-Azhar. Under this system, the college was a separate institution within the mosque compound, with its own classrooms, dormitories and a library.

===Mamluks===
Under the Mamluks, Al-Azhar gained influence and rose in prestige.
The Mamluks established salaries for instructors and stipends for the students and gave the institution an endowment. A college was built for the institution in 1340, outside of the mosque. In the late 1400s, the buildings were renovated and new dormitories were built for the students.

During this time Cairo had 70 other institutions of Islamic learning, however, Al-Azhar attracted many scholars due to its prestige. The famed Ibn Khaldun taught at Al-Azhar starting in 1383.

During this time texts were few and much of the learning happened by students memorizing their teachers&#x27; lectures and notes. In fact, blind young boys were enrolled at Al-Azhar in the hopes that they could eventually earn a living as teachers.

===Ottomans===

During the Ottoman period, Al-Azhar&#x27;s prestige and influence grew to the point of becoming the preeminent institution for Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world. During this time, the &quot;Shaykh Al-Azhar&quot; was established, an office given to the leading scholar at the institution; prior to this the head of the institution was not necessarily a scholar. In 1748, the Ottoman pasha tried to get Al-Azhar to teach astronomy and mathematics, to little avail.

During the time there wasn&#x27;t a system of academic degrees, instead the &quot;shaykh&quot; (professor) determined if the student was sufficiently trained to enter a professor (ijazah). The average length of study was 6 years. Despite the lack of bureaucracy, the training remained rigorous and prolonged. Students were loosely organized into &quot;riwaq&quot; (a sort of fraternity) organized according to their nationality and branch of Islamic law they studied. Each &quot;riwaq&quot; was supervised by a professor. A rector, usually a senior professor, oversaw the finances.

===Post-Ottoman===

By the mid 19th century, al-Azhar had surpassed Istanbul and was considered the capital of Sunni legal expertise; a main centre of power in the Islamic world; and a rival to Damascus, Mecca and Baghdad.

When the Kingdom of Egypt was established in 1923, the signing of the new nation&#x27;s constitution was delayed because of King Fuad I&#x27;s insistence that Al-Azhar and other religious institutions were to be subject to him and not the Egyptian parliament. The King Fuad I Edition of the Qur&#x27;an was first published on 10 July 1924 by a committee from Al-Azhar University Prominent committee members included Islamic scholar, Muhammad b. &#x27;Ali al-Husayni al-Haddad. Noteworthy Western scholars/academics working in Egypt at the time include Bergsträsser and Jeffery. Methodological differences aside, speculation alludes to a spirit of cooperation. Bergsträsser was certainly impressed with the work.

In March 1924, Abdülmecid II had been deposed as Caliph, nominally the supreme religious and political leader of all Sunni Muslims across the world. The Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar repudiated the abolition and was part of a call from Al-Azhar for an Islamic Conference. The unsuccessful &quot;caliphate conference&quot; was held under the presidency of the Grand Chancellor of Azhar in 1926 but no one was able to gain a consensus for the candidacy across the Islamic world. Candidates proposed for the caliphate included King Fuad.

===Modernization===
The pioneering Pakistani journalist Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah became the first woman to address the university in 1955. In 1961, Al-Azhar was re-established as a university under the government of Egypt&#x27;s second President Gamal Abdel Nasser when a wide range of secular faculties were added for the first time, such as business, economics, science, pharmacy, medicine, engineering and agriculture. Before that date, the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; classifies the Al-Azhar variously as madrasa, center of higher learning and, since the 19th century, religious university, but not as a university in the full sense, referring to the modern transition process as &quot;from madrasa to university&quot;. Other academic sources also refer to al-Azhar as a madrasa in pre-modern times before its transformation into a university. An Islamic women&#x27;s faculty was also added in the same year.

==Religious ideology==
Historically, Al-Azhar had a membership that represented diverse opinions within Islam. The theological schools of al-Ash&#x27;ari and al-Maturidi were both represented. It has a long tradition of teaching all four schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi, and Hanbali). The chief mufti of each school of thought acted as the dean, responsible for the teachers and students in that group. During the time of the Ottomans, the Hanafi dean came to hold a position as &quot;primus inter pares&quot;. It also had membership from the seven main Sufi orders. Al-Azhar has had an antagonistic relationship with Wahhabism. According to a 2011 report issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Al Azhar is strongly Sufi in character:
Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the al-Azhar mosque and university system. Although al-Azhar is not monolithic, its identity has been strongly associated with Sufism. The current Shaykh al-Azhar (rector of the school), Ahmed el-Tayeb, is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league; the former Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar Ali Gomaa is also a highly respected Sufi master.

However, in the early 20th century, enlightened Modernist thinkers such as Muhammad Abduh led a reform of the curriculum, reintroducing a desire for legal reform through ijtihad. Subsequently, disputes were had between modernist intellectuals and traditionalists within al-Azhar. Al-Azhar now maintains a modernist position, advocating &quot;Wasatiyya&quot; (centrism), a reaction against the extreme textualism of many Wahhabi Salafi ideologues. Wasatiyya covers a range of thinkers, some of whom are liberal intellectuals with religious inclinations, preachers such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi and many members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Since the 2013 coup however, Al-Azhar has taken a position against the brotherhood.

The nineteenth and current Grand Mufti of Egypt and Al Azhar scholar, is Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam. The university is opposed to overt liberal reform of Islam and issued a fatwa against the liberal Ibn Rushd-Goethe mosque in Berlin because it banned face-covering veils such as burqa and niqab on its premises while allowing women and men to pray together. The fatwa encompassed all present and future liberal mosques.

==Council of Senior Scholars==

Al-Azhar University&#x27;s Council of Senior Scholars was founded in 1911 but was replaced in 1961 by the Center for Islamic Research. In July 2012, after the law restricting Al-Azhar University&#x27;s autonomy was modified by the incoming president Mohamed Morsi, the council was reformed. The Council consists of 40 members and as of February 2013 had 14 vacancies all appointed by the current imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed El-Tayeb, who was appointed by the prior president, Hosni Mubarak. Once the remaining 14 vacancies are filled, new vacancies will be appointed by the existing Council itself. All four madhahib (schools) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence are proportionally represented on the council (Hanafi, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali, Maliki) and voting is on a majority basis. In addition to El-Tayeb, other prominent members of the Council include the outgoing Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa. The council is tasked with nominating the Grand Mufti of Egypt (subject to presidential approval), electing the next Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, and is expected to be the final authority in determining if new legislation is compliant with Islamic law. Although the council&#x27;s decisions are not binding (absent new legislation), it is expected that it would be difficult for the parliament to pass legislation deemed by the council as against Islamic law.

In January 2013, Al-Tayeb referred a relatively minor issue related to Islamic bonds to the council, for the first time asserting the council&#x27;s jurisdiction. In 2013, the Council elected Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam to be the next Grand Mufti of Egypt. This marks the first time that the Grand Mufti would be elected by Islamic scholars since the position was created in 1895. Prior to this, the Egyptian head of state made the appointment.

==Views==
Al-Azhar&#x27;s muftis have a history of being consulted on political issues. Muhammad Ali Pasha appointed Al-Azhar muftis to the &quot;Consultative Council&quot; in 1829 and this would be repeated by Abbas I and later Isma&#x27;il Pasha. At the same time, there were many cases where the Egyptian ruler would disregard the opinion of Al-Azhar scholars.
Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy noted that among the priorities of Muslims are &quot;to master all knowledge of the world and the hereafter, not least the technology of modern weapons to strengthen and defend the community and faith&quot;. He added that &quot;mastery over modern weaponry is important to prepare for any eventuality or prejudices of the others, although Islam is a religion of peace&quot;.

Sheikh Tantawy also reasserted that his is the best faith to follow and that Muslims have the duty of active da&#x27;wa. He has made declarations about Muslims interacting with non-Muslims who are not a threat to Muslims. There are non-Muslims living apart from Muslims and who are not enemies of Islam (&quot;Muslims are allowed to undertake exchanges of interests with these non-Muslims so long as these ties do not tarnish the image of the faith&quot;), and there are &quot;the non-Muslims who live in the same country as the Muslims in cooperation and on friendly terms, and are not enemies of the faith&quot; (&quot;in this case, their rights and responsibilities are the same as the Muslims so long as they do not become enemies of Islam&quot;). Shi&#x27;a fiqh (according to a fatwa by Al-Azhar) is accepted as a fifth school of Islamic thought.

In October 2007, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, then the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, drew allegations of stifling freedom of speech when he asked the Egyptian government to toughen its rules and punishments against journalists. During a Friday sermon in the presence of Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and a number of ministers, Tantawy was alleged to have stated that journalism which contributes to the spread of false rumours rather than true news deserved to be boycotted, and that it was tantamount to sinning for readers to purchase such newspapers. Tantawy, a supporter of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also called for a punishment of eighty lashes to &quot;those who spread rumors&quot; in an indictment of speculation by journalists over Mubarak&#x27;s ill health and possible death. This was not the first time that he had criticized the Egyptian press regarding its news coverage nor the first time he in return had been accused by the press of opposing freedom of speech. During a religious celebration in the same month, Tantawy had released comments alluding to &quot;the arrogant and the pretenders who accuse others with the ugliest vice and unsubstantiated charges&quot;. In response, Egypt&#x27;s press union issued a statement suggesting that Tantawy appeared to be involved in inciting and escalating a campaign against journalists and freedom of the press. Tantawy died in 2010 and was succeeded by Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb.

In 2016 Ahmed el-Tayeb reissued the fatwa on Shia Muslims, calling Shia the fifth school of Islam and seeing no problem with conversions from Sunni to Shia Islam. However, the NGOs report that violence and propaganda against the country&#x27;s Shia minority continues. Shia Muslims are frequently denied services in addition to being called derogatory names. Anti-Shia sentiment is spread through education at all levels. Clerics educated at Al-Azhar University publicly promote sectarian beliefs by calling Shia Muslims infidels and encourage isolation and marginalization of Shia Muslims in Egypt.

Scholars from Al-Azhar declared the writings to Farag Foda to be blasphemous. Muhammad al-Ghazali, a member of Al-Azhar, declared Foda to be guilty of apostasy. According to Geneive Abdo, Muhammad al-Ghazali also added that anyone killing an apostate would not be punished, while according to Nathan Brown, Muhammad al-Ghazali stopped just short of condoning Foroda&#x27;s assassination.
 Foda was assassinated in June 1992, by an Egyptian terrorist group al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, who claimed justification from Al-Azhar&#x27;s fatwas. In response, a scholar at Al-Azhar published &quot;Man Qatala Faraj Fawda&quot;.

<doc id="274752" wikidata="Q739820" url="?curid=274752" title="Ken Dryden">
<text>Kenneth Wayne Dryden (born August 8, 1947) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender, politician, lawyer, businessman, and author. He is an Officer of the Order of Canada and a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 2004 to 2011 and Minister of Social Development from 2004 to 2006. In 2017, the league counted him in history&#x27;s 100 Greatest NHL Players. He received the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Dryden was born in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1947. His parents were Murray Dryden (1911–2004) and Margaret Adelia Campbell (1912–1985). He has a sister, Judy, and a brother, Dave, who was also an NHL goaltender. Dryden was raised in Islington, Ontario, then a suburb of Toronto. He played with the Etobicoke Indians of the Metro Junior B Hockey League as well as Humber Valley Packers of the Metro Toronto Hockey League.

Dryden was drafted fourteenth overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1964 NHL Amateur Draft. Days later, June 28, Boston traded Dryden, along with Alex Campbell, to the Montreal Canadiens for Paul Reid and Guy Allen. Dryden was told by his agent that he had been drafted by the Canadiens and did not find out until the mid-1970s that he had been drafted by the Bruins.

Rather than play for the Canadiens in 1964, Dryden pursued a B.A. degree in History at Cornell University, where he also played hockey until his graduation in 1969. He backstopped the Cornell Big Red to the 1967 National Collegiate Athletic Association championship and to three consecutive ECAC tournament championships, and won 76 of his 81 varsity starts. At Cornell, he was a member of the Quill and Dagger society. He also was a member of the Canadian amateur national team at the 1969 World Ice Hockey Championships tournament in Stockholm.

Dryden took a break from the NHL for the 1973–74 season to article for a Toronto law firm, and to earn an LL.B. degree he received from McGill University in 1973. During this time Dryden interned with Ralph Nader&#x27;s Public Citizen organization. Inspired by Nader&#x27;s call in Action for a Change for establishing Public Interest Research Group&#x27;s, Dryden tried to establish the Ontario Public Interest Research Group in the Province of Ontario.

Dryden&#x27;s jersey number 1 was retired by the Cornell Big Red on February 25, 2010; along with Joe Nieuwendyk, he is one of only two players to have their numbers retired by Cornell&#x27;s hockey program.

==Playing career==
Dryden made his NHL debut on Sunday March 14, 1971 against the Pittsburgh Penguins in Pittsburgh. The Canadiens won the game 5-1, and the only goal scored against Ken was by a player named John Stewart. Later, on March 20, 1971, he played in a home game against his brother Dave Dryden, a fellow backup goaltender for Buffalo Sabres, when Canadiens starter Rogie Vachon suffered an injury; this still stands, as of 2021, as the only time a pair of brothers faced against each other as goaltenders. He was called up from the minors late in the season and played only six regular-season games, but rang up 1.65 goals-against average. This earned him the starting goaltending job for the playoffs ahead of veteran Rogie Vachon, and he helped the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup. He also won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. He helped the Habs win five more Stanley Cups in 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979.

The following year Dryden won the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the year; he was not eligible for it the previous year because he did not play enough regular-season games. He is the only player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy before winning the rookie of the year award, and the only goaltender to win both the Conn Smythe and the Stanley Cup before losing a regular-season game. In the autumn of 1972 Dryden played for Team Canada in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet national ice hockey team.

Dryden played from 1971 to 1979, with a break during the entire 1973–74 season; he was unhappy with the contract that the Canadiens offered him, which he considered less than his market worth, given that he had won the Stanley Cup and Vezina Trophy. He announced on September 14, 1973, that he was joining the Toronto law firm of Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt as a legal clerk for the year, for $135 a week. He skipped training camp and held out that season. The Canadiens still had a good year, going 45-24-9, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the New York Rangers in six games. The Canadiens allowed 56 more goals in the 1973–74 season than they had the year before with Dryden. Dryden used that year to fulfill the requirements for his law degree at McGill and article for a law firm. He retired for the last time on July 9, 1979.

Compared to those of most other great hockey players, Dryden&#x27;s NHL career was very short: just over seven full seasons. Thus he did not amass record totals in most statistical categories. As he played all his years with a dynasty and retired before he passed his prime, his statistical percentages are unparalleled. His regular-season totals include a 74.3 winning percentage, a 2.24 goals-against average, a 92.2 save percentage, 46 shutouts, and 258 wins, only 57 losses and 74 ties in just 397 NHL games. He won the Vezina Trophy five times, at the time awarded to the goaltender on the team who allowed the fewest goals, and in the same years was selected as a First Team All-Star. In 1998, he was ranked number 25 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, a remarkable achievement for a player with a comparatively brief career.

At 6 feet, 4 inches, Dryden was so tall that during stoppages in play he struck what became his trademark pose: leaning upon his stick. He was known as the &quot;four-storey goalie,&quot; and was once referred to as &quot;that thieving giraffe&quot; by Boston Bruins superstar Phil Esposito, in reference to Dryden&#x27;s skill and height. Unbeknownst to him, his pose was exactly the same as the one struck by fellow Canadiens goaltender, Georges Vézina, 60 years prior.

Dryden was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983, as soon as he was eligible. His jersey number 29 was retired by the Canadiens on January 29, 2007. He was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.

===Writing===
Dryden wrote one book during his hockey career: &quot;Face-Off at the Summit&quot;. It was a diary about Team Canada in the Canada vs. Soviet Union series of 1972. The book has been out of print for many years.

After retiring from hockey Dryden wrote several more books. &quot;The Game&quot; was a commercial and critical success, and was nominated for a Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1983. His next book, &quot;Home Game: Hockey and Life in Canada&quot; (1990), written with Roy MacGregor, was developed into an award-winning Canadian Broadcasting Corporation six-part documentary series for television. His fourth book was &quot;The Moved and the Shaken: The Story of One Man&#x27;s Life&quot; (1993). His fifth book, &quot;In School: Our Kids, Our Teachers, Our Classrooms&quot; (1995), written with Roy MacGregor, was about Canada’s educational system. &quot;Becoming Canada&quot; (2010) argued for a new definition of Canada and its unique place in the world.

In 2019, he published &quot;Scotty: A Hockey Life Like No Other,&quot; his biography of his Canadiens coach Scotty Bowman. Dryden says at the beginning that he &quot;&#x27;needed&quot; to write this book,&#x27; because &#x27;Scotty had lived a truly unique life. He has experienced almost &quot;everything&quot; in hockey, up close, for the best part of a century - and his is a life that no on else will live again. It&#x27;s a life that had to be captured. And it needs to be captured now, because time is moving on.&#x27; 

Feeling that Bowman was &#x27;too practical and focused&#x27; to be a natural storyteller, Dryden instead asked Bowman to think like a coach and select the 8 greatest teams of all time (but only one per dynasty) and explain what he thought about them, how we coach against them but also what was happening in his life at that time and through that process, Bowman&#x27;s story would be told.

===Commentator===

Dryden worked as a television hockey commentator at the 1980, 1984 and 1988 Winter Olympics. He served as a colour commentator with play-by-play man Al Michaels for ABC&#x27;s coverage of the &quot;Miracle on Ice.&quot; Immediately before Mike Eruzione&#x27;s game-winning goal for the US, Dryden expressed his concern that the team was &quot;depending a little bit too much&quot; on goaltender Jim Craig after Craig had just made &quot;too many good saves.&quot;

===Sports executive===
In 1997, Dryden was hired as president of the Toronto Maple Leafs by minority owner Larry Tanenbaum. Pat Quinn became head coach in 1998, and there were reports that the two men had a frosty relationship. A few months after joining the Leafs, Quinn became general manager, a move thought by some to preempt Dryden from hiring former Canadiens teammate Bob Gainey.

Dryden spoke at the Open Ice Summit in 1999, to discuss improvements needed to ice hockey in Canada. He wanted delegates to accept that progress made at the lower levels and off the ice was important in achieving international results. He was cautious that change would come slowly and be costly, but felt the summit was an important step in making progress. He also urged for the end to persistent abuse of on-ice officials, or Canada would lose 10,000 referees each year. As a result of the summit, Hockey Canada started to educate on the importance of respect for game officials.

On August 29, 2003, with the hiring of John Ferguson, Jr. as general manager, there was a major management shakeup. Majority owner Steve Stavro was bought out by the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan and he stepped down as chairman in favour of Larry Tanenbaum. Quinn continued as head coach. Dryden&#x27;s position was abolished, in favour of having both the Leafs&#x27; and Raptors&#x27; managers reporting directly to MLSE President and CEO Richard Peddie. Dryden was shuffled to the less important role of vice-chairman and given a spot on MLSE&#x27;s board of directors. This was described by commentators as &quot;sitting outside the loop&quot;, as Dryden did not report directly to Leafs ownership. He stayed on until 2004 when he resigned to enter politics.

===Teaching===
In January 2012, Dryden was appointed a &quot;Special Visitor&quot; at his alma mater McGill University&#x27;s Institute for the Study of Canada. He taught a Canadian Studies course entitled &quot;Thinking the Future to Make the Future,&quot; which focused on issues facing Canada in the future and possible solutions to them.

==Political career==
Dryden joined the Liberal Party of Canada and ran for the House of Commons in the 2004 federal election. He was selected by party leader and Prime Minister Paul Martin as a &quot;star candidate&quot; in the Toronto riding of York Centre, then considered a safe Liberal riding.

Dryden was elected by a margin of over 11,000 votes. He was named to Cabinet as Minister of Social Development. He made headlines on February 16, 2005, as the target of a remark by Conservative Member of Parliament Rona Ambrose who said about Dryden, &quot;working women want to make their own choices, we don&#x27;t need old white guys telling us what to do.&quot; Ambrose made the remarks after Dryden commented on a poll that analyzed child care choices by Canadian families. Dryden won generally favourable reviews for his performance in Cabinet.

Dryden was re-elected in the 2006 federal election, while the Liberals were defeated and Paul Martin resigned the party leadership. Interim party and opposition leader Bill Graham named Dryden to his shadow cabinet as health critic.

Dryden&#x27;s margin of victory in York Centre dwindled in the 2006 and 2008 elections. In the 2011 federal election, he focused his efforts on his own re-election instead of campaigning for other candidates as he did in the past, and he received a visit from former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Still, Dryden lost his seat to Conservative candidate Mark Adler by nearly 6,000 votes.

===Leadership bid===

On April 28, 2006, Dryden announced that he would run for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada, which would be choosing a successor to Paul Martin at a convention in Montreal on December 2, 2006.

A poll found that Dryden&#x27;s potential pool of support exceeded that of his opponents, due mainly to his former NHL career. His fundraising fell well below that of top leadership contenders (Michael Ignatieff, Gerard Kennedy, Stéphane Dion and Bob Rae). A variety of media pundits criticized his ponderous speaking style and limited French. Supporters argued that few people were strongly opposed to him and that if he ran he could attract more support on later ballots as a consensus candidate.

At the convention, Dryden came in fifth place on the first ballot with 238 delegates, 4.9% of the vote. On the second ballot, he came in last place with 219 votes (4.7%) and was eliminated. He initially threw his support to Bob Rae, but after Rae was eliminated in the third ballot and released all of his delegates, Dryden endorsed Stéphane Dion, who went on to win the leadership.

According to Elections Canada filings, as of 2013 Dryden&#x27;s campaign still owed $225,000.

==Personal life==
Ken is the son of Margaret and Murray Dryden. 
Dryden and his wife Lynda have two children and four grandchildren. He is a first cousin, twice removed, of Murray Murdoch, another former NHL player and a longtime coach of Yale University&#x27;s hockey team, and Andrew Dryden Blair, who played on the 1931-32 Leafs Stanley Cup winning team. There is another distant relationship with the Apps family: Syl Apps also served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, serving as Minister of Correctional Services, and his father&#x27;s uncle, John C. Dryden, was Treasurer in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. His older brother Dave also played in the NHL and the WHA as a goalie, from 1961 to 1980.

<text>Eugène-Auguste Ysaÿe (; 16 July 185812 May 1931) was a Belgian virtuoso violinist, composer, and conductor. He was regarded as &quot;The King of the Violin&quot;, or, as Nathan Milstein put it, the &quot;tsar&quot;.

==Legend of the Ysaÿe violin==
Eugène Ysaÿe came from a background of &quot;artisans&quot;, though a large part of his family played instruments. As violinist Arnold Steinhardt recounts, a legend was passed down through the Ysaÿe family about the first violin brought to the lineage:
It was told of a boy whom some woodcutters found in the forest and brought to the village. The boy grew up to be a blacksmith. Once, at a village festival, he astonished everyone by playing the viol beautifully. From then on the villagers took pleasure in dancing and singing to the strains of his viol. One day an illustrious stranger stopped in front of the smithy to have his horse shod. The count&#x27;s servant saw the viol inside and told the young smith that he had heard a new Italian instrument played by some minstrels at the count&#x27;s court. That instrument, called the violin, was much better than the viol – its tone was like the human voice and could express every feeling and passion. From that moment the young man no longer took pleasure in his viol. Day and night he was thinking of that wonderful new instrument that could express joy and sorrow and whose tones went straight to the human heart.
Then he had a dream: he saw before him a young woman of indescribable beauty, not unlike his own love, Biethline. She came to him and kissed his brow. The young man awoke and looked at the wall his broken and neglected viol used to hang on and could barely believe his eyes: there, instead of the viol, was a new instrument of beautiful proportions. He put it against his shoulder and drew the bow over the strings, producing sounds that were truly divine. The violin sang in a heartwarming tone: it rejoiced and wept for happiness – and so did the musician. Thus, goes the legend, came the first violin to the Ardennes and to the Ysaÿe family.
==Early years==
Born in Liège, Ysaÿe began violin lessons at age five with his father. He would later recognize his father&#x27;s teaching as the foundation of everything he knew on his instrument, even though he went on to study with highly reputed masters. In 1867, Ysaÿe entered the Royal Conservatory of Liège to study with Désiré Heynberg, and in the process won a shared second prize with the Viotti 22nd Violin Concerto. He then went on to study with Henryk Wieniawski for two years in Brussels and Henri Vieuxtemps in Paris.

Studying with these teachers meant that he was part of the so-called Franco-Belgian school of violin playing, which dates back to the development of the modern violin bow by François Tourte. Qualities of this &quot;École&quot; included elegance, a full tone with a sense of drawing a &quot;long&quot; bow with no jerks, precise left hand techniques, and bowing using the whole forearm while keeping both the wrist and upper arm quiet (as opposed to Joseph Joachim&#x27;s German school of wrist bowing and Leopold Auer&#x27;s Russian concept of using the whole arm.)

==Early career==

After his graduation from the Royal Conservatory of Liège, Ysaÿe was the principal violin of the Benjamin Bilse beer-hall orchestra, which later developed into the Berlin Philharmonic. Many musicians of note and influence came regularly to hear this orchestra and Ysaÿe in particular, among them Joseph Joachim, Franz Liszt, Clara Schumann, and Anton Rubinstein, who asked that Ysaÿe be released from his contract to accompany him on tour.

When Ysaÿe was 27 years old, he was recommended as a soloist for one of the Concerts Colonne in Paris, which was the start of his great success as a concert artist. The next year, Ysaÿe received a professorship at the Brussels Conservatoire. His teaching career continued for the rest of his life, even after he left the Conservatory in 1898. Among his notable pupils were Josef Gingold, the viola virtuoso William Primrose, the violin virtuoso Nathan Milstein (who primarily studied with Pyotr Stolyarsky), Oskar Back, Ernest Bloch, Jascha Brodsky, Mathieu Crickboom, George Enescu, Aldo Ferraresi, Jonny Heykens, Nellie A. Hope, Charles Houdret, Julia Klumpke, Louis Persinger, Oscar Shumsky, and Jacques Thibaud. ()
During his tenure as professor at the Conservatoire, Ysaÿe continued to tour ever more widely, visiting all of Europe, Russia, and the United States. Despite health concerns, particularly regarding the condition of his hands, Ysaÿe was at his best when performing, and many prominent composers dedicated major works to him, including Claude Debussy, Camille Saint-Saëns, César Franck, and Ernest Chausson. He arranged for violin and orchestra Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Étude en forme de valse&quot;, which had originally been written for solo piano.

Franck&#x27;s Violin Sonata in A was written as a wedding present for Ysaÿe and his wife in 1886. Ysaÿe played it often for the rest of his life. Chausson&#x27;s &quot;Poème&quot; was his response to Ysaÿe&#x27;s request for a concerto. Joseph Szigeti thought those two dedications demonstrated the enormous respect in which Ysaÿe was held.

In 1886, he established the Ysaÿe Quartet, which premiered Debussy&#x27;s String Quartet.

==Teaching and composing==

As his physical ailments grew more prohibitive, Ysaÿe turned more to teaching, conducting and an early love, composition. Among his most famous works are the six &quot;Sonatas for Solo Violin&quot; op. 27, the unaccompanied &quot;Sonata for Cello&quot;, op. 28, one &quot;Sonata for Two Violins&quot;, eight &quot;Poèmes&quot; for various instruments (one or two violins, violin and cello, string quartet) and orchestra (&quot;Poème élégiaque&quot;, &quot;Poème de l&#x27;Extase&quot;, &quot;Chant d&#x27;hiver&quot;, &quot;Poème nocturne&quot;, among others), pieces for string orchestra without basses (including &quot;Exil&quot;), several violin concertos, various shorter pieces for violin and piano, two string trios, an early string quintet, and an opera, &quot;Peter the Miner&quot;, written near the end of his life in the Walloon language.

Ysaÿe had been offered the post of music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1898, but declined it due to his busy solo performance schedule. In 1918, he accepted the music director&#x27;s position with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1922 and with which he made several recordings.

Finally, in 1931, suffering from the extreme ravages of diabetes that had necessitated the amputation of his left foot, Eugène Ysaÿe died in his house in Forest, Belgium, 48 Avenue Brugmann, and was interred in the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels.

==Performing career==
As a performer, Ysaÿe was compelling and highly original. Pablo Casals claimed never to have heard a violinist play in tune before Ysaÿe, and Carl Flesch called him &quot;the most outstanding and individual violinist I have ever heard in my life.&quot;

Ysaÿe possessed a large and flexible tone, influenced by a considerable variety of vibrato — from no vibrato at all to very intense. He said, &quot;Don&#x27;t always vibrate, but always be vibrating&quot;. His &quot;modus operandi&quot; was, in his own words: &quot;Nothing which wouldn&#x27;t have for goal emotion, poetry, heart.&quot; The conductor Sir Henry Wood said, &quot;The quality of tone was ravishingly beautiful... He seemed to get more colour out of a violin than any of his contemporaries.&quot;

Possibly the most distinctive feature of Ysaÿe&#x27;s interpretations was his masterful rubato (in English: &quot;stolen&quot;). Sir Henry Wood said, &quot;Whenever he stole time from one note, he faithfully paid it back within four bars&quot;, allowing his accompanist to maintain strict tempo under his free cantilena. Incidentally, this kind of rubato fits the description of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s rubato.

Although Ysaÿe was a great interpreter of late Romantic and early modern composers — Max Bruch, Camille Saint-Saëns, and César Franck, who said he was their greatest interpreter — he was admired for his Bach and Beethoven interpretations. His technique was brilliant and finely honed, and in this respect he is the first modern violinist whose technique was without the shortcomings of some earlier artists.

An international violin competition in Brussels was created in his memory: in 1951, this became the violin section of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition.

==Personal life==

Ysaÿe was married twice. His first marriage, on 28 September 1886 in Arlon, was to Louise Bourdau (from Dendermonde), with whom he had three sons and two daughters: Gabriel (1887–1961), Carry (1889–1930), Thérèse called Thésy (1890–1956), Antoine (1894–1979) and Théodore (1898–1934). César Franck presented his Violin Sonata in A to them as a gift on the morning of the wedding, and after a hurried rehearsal Ysaÿe performed the piece at the marriage celebration. The sonata had its formal concert premiere in Brussels on 15 December 1886 with Franck in the audience.

After Louise&#x27;s death (9 February 1924) he married a pupil of his, Jeanette Dincin (1902–1967), 44 years his junior. She was a violinist who in her teens had studied with prominent teachers such as Franz Kneisel, Leopold Auer, and Otakar Ševčík. Ysaÿe met her in 1922 while conductor of the Cincinnati Orchestra. She cared for him in his ailing years. Eugène&#x27;s only request of her after he died was that she carry on her performances under his name.

His brother was pianist and composer Théo Ysaÿe (1865–1918), and his great-grandson is Marc Ysaÿe, founder-controller of radio Classic 21 and drummer of rock band Machiavel. Eugène Ysaÿe was also close friends with Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, whom he taught violin despite her lack of talent. His widow took over the royal teaching herself after his death, and the queen began the competition in his honor. His granddaughter, Nadine Ysaye Mosbaugh, was a noted concert pianist who toured Europe with José Iturbi before settling down in Canada. She also hosted and performed on a classical radio program on CKAR Radio in Huntsville, Ontario. Ysaÿe&#x27;s great-grandson, Franc Mosbaugh, is a Canadian musician/singer and award-winning commercial jingle composer.

Ysaÿe was also a friend of Claude Debussy and would sometimes correspond with him by letter. The two had great respect for each other and Ysaÿe was a significant supporter of the younger composer&#x27;s early career. Debussy dedicated his only string quartet to the violinist, who studied the score with great care. The quartet received its premiere on 29 December 1893 by the Ysaÿe Quartet at the Société Nationale in Paris, to mixed reviews. The virtuoso and the composer also corresponded during the writing of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot;.

==The Eugène Ysaÿe Collection==

The Eugène Ysaÿe Collection, housed in the Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium, combines four decades of purchases with a donation made by the Ysaÿe family in 2007. An essential source for the study of musician&#x27;s life and works, it includes some 700 letters and autograph scores, over 1,000 printed scores and books, abundant collection of photographs, four films, and about fifty 78 RPM and 33 RPM recordings. A second collection of handwritten and printed scores is conserved in New York at the Juilliard School.

===Operas===
* &quot;Piére li houyeû&quot; (Pierre le mineur) 1931 (Original in Walloon language, perhaps the only opera composed for a libretto in that language)

:The première of &quot;Piére li houyeû&quot; (the composer&#x27;s only opera) took place at the Opéra de Liège on 4 March 1931, during a long evening dedicated to the composer&#x27;s works, in the presence of Queen Elisabeth of Belgium who had been his pupil. Ysaÿe, very ill with diabetes, listened to the performance from his hospital room. The Queen, informed of the seriousness of Ysaÿe&#x27;s condition, had organised a radio broadcast of the work and Ysaÿe addressed the audience from his room. The work was then performed in Brussels on 25 April. Ysaÿe, transported on a stretcher to a box in the theater, was able to view the performance. He died 18 days later.
The critics were appreciative but the opera did not find a place in the standard repertoire. It was performed again by Opéra Royal de Wallonie in Liege, 25 November 2006. This performance was recorded and is published by the non-profit association in a two CD set accompanied by a book containing the Walloon text and its French, Dutch and English translations, and introductory texts in French, Dutch, German and English. The story is based on an incident that occurred in 1877 during a miners&#x27; strike in the Liège region. During clashes with the police, some shots were fired. The wife of a foreman rushed forward to seize a grenade which had been placed in the offices by a striker, but the grenade exploded and she was killed.

* &quot;L’avièrge di pièr&quot; (La vierge de pierre) – not completed, not performed

A complete list of available orchestral works, including concerto works, is available on the Symphony Orchestra Library Center.

<text>Rodney Cory Langway (born May 3, 1957) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman who played for the Montreal Canadiens and Washington Capitals in the National Hockey League (NHL) and Birmingham Bulls of the World Hockey Association (WHA). He won the 1979 Stanley Cup with the Canadiens.

Langway also spent time with teams in the American Hockey League (AHL) and East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) as a player-coach after his NHL career ended. A two-time winner of the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the top defenseman in the NHL, Langway was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Early life and amateur career==
Langway was born to a US military family in Taipei, Taiwan, and is the only NHL player to have been born there. He grew up in Randolph, Massachusetts, and did not begin playing hockey until age 13 in 1970, aside from pick-up street hockey games with the neighborhood boys. He then led Randolph High School to three straight state tournament appearances in 1973, 1974 and 1975. He was also a standout quarterback for the Blue Devils and was one of the top football recruits in the nation. As a catcher on the Randolph High baseball team, Langway was considered a baseball pro-prospect. He was an honor student. However, the top college football programs in the country had identified Langway as a future NFL quarterback. It was a football recruiter from the University of New Hampshire who convinced him to play college hockey at UNH, one of the few schools that would allow him to play &quot;both&quot; football and hockey in college, which he did without having to choose one over the other as an incoming freshman. Langway went on to lead UNH to the NCAA hockey final four in 1977. Ultimately, hockey ended up being the direction for him as a professional career. He was inducted into the Randolph High and UNH Athletic Halls of Fame.

==Professional career==
A left-handed shot, Langway was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL in 1977 and by the Birmingham Bulls of the WHA in the same year. He played one season for the Bulls (1977–78) before joining the Canadiens for the 1978–79 NHL season. He was 22 years old when he helped the Canadiens win the Stanley Cup that year. He played for Montreal until he was traded to the Washington Capitals for the start of the 1982–83 season.

The Capitals acquired Langway from the Canadiens in a blockbuster trade—going with Doug Jarvis, Craig Laughlin, and Brian Engblom in exchange for Ryan Walter and Rick Green. That trade not only saved the franchise from moving out of D.C., but also stocked them for an extended string of postseason appearances. After not making the playoffs in their first eight seasons in the league, the Capitals competed in the postseason in every one of the 11 years that Langway was with the team. Following that trade, the Capitals named Langway their captain (succeeding the aforementioned Ryan Walter), which he would hold for the next 11 seasons until his NHL retirement.
As captain, Langway became known as an accomplished leader who demanded greatness from himself and others, earning the nickname &quot;Secretary of Defense&quot;. Many people considered him the franchise&#x27;s savior, despite not being the sort of player that one would expect to prevent the club from moving. Langway&#x27;s predecessors as Norris Trophy winners were the dominant defensemen of the 1970s, like Bobby Orr, Larry Robinson, and Denis Potvin, who had put up high scoring numbers. By contrast, Langway was a traditional defender whose shot was likened to a &quot;cool summer breeze&quot;, scoring only three goals during one of his best seasons, though he is remembered by Capitals fans for a game–winning goal in overtime against the New York Rangers&#x27; Mike Richter in the 1990 playoffs. Despite his lack of offensive production, his excellence at his position was credited with significantly reducing the Capitals&#x27; goals-against average, which enabled them to finally make the playoffs.

Langway won the Norris Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defenseman in both 1983 and 1984. He earned two postseason All-Star first team selections and one Second Team selection as a defenseman—the first American NHL All-Star since Frank Brimsek in 1948. Langway finished runner-up to Wayne Gretzky for the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1984. He was also part of the NHL All-Star team that played the Soviet national hockey team in Rendez-Vous &#x27;87. Upon his retirement from the NHL during the 1992–93 season, Langway was the last active player who won a Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens during their late-70s dynasty. In international hockey, he represented the United States in the 1981, 1984, and 1987 Canada Cup as well as the 1982 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments.

==Coaching career==
Langway served as player-coach for the San Francisco Spiders during their single season as an IHL team in 1995–1996. Langway began his career before helmets were mandatory and was the only member of the Spiders who played without a helmet under a league grandfather clause. He played without a helmet even while he was playing for the Washington Capitals and was normally the only player on the ice who was not wearing a helmet.

Langway was also an assistant coach under Tom McVie with the American Hockey League&#x27;s Providence Bruins during the 1997–98 season. He played in ten games that year to assist with on-ice development, during which time he was not granted an exemption to play without a helmet. Providence finished with a mere 19 victories that season, and Langway did not return the following year after McVie was reassigned to be a scout by the Boston organization.

During the 2003–04 season, Langway coached the Richmond Riverdogs expansion franchise in the United Hockey League to a division championship, and a first-round playoff loss to the Elmira Jackals. Team management did not extend Langway&#x27;s contract after the first season.

<text>John Machin (bapt. c. 1686 – June 9, 1751) was a professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London. He is best known for developing a quickly converging series for pi in 1706 and using it to compute pi to 100 decimal places.

== History ==
John Machin served as secretary of the Royal Society from 1718 to 1747. 
He was also a member of the commission which decided the Calculus priority dispute between Leibniz and Newton in 1712.

On 16 May 1713 he succeeded Alexander Torriano as professor of astronomy in Gresham College, and held the post until his death, which occurred in London on 9 June 1751. 
Machin enjoyed a high mathematical reputation. In 1706, Machin computed the value of π with the formula given below to one hundred decimal places. His ingenious quadrature of the circle was later investigated by Charles Hutton. A mass of his manuscripts is preserved by the Royal Astronomical Society; and writing to William Jones in 1727, he asserted his claim to the parliamentary reward of £10,000 for amending the lunar tables.

In 1728, he was listed as one of the subscribers to the &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; of Ephraim Chambers.

== Formula ==
Machin&#x27;s formula (for which the derivation is straightforward) is:

: formula_1

The benefit of the new formula, a variation on the Gregory–Leibniz series ( = arctan 1), was that it had a significantly increased rate of convergence, which made it a much more practical method of calculation.

To compute π to 100 decimal places, he combined his formula with the Taylor series expansion for the inverse tangent. (Brook Taylor was Machin&#x27;s contemporary in Cambridge University.) Machin&#x27;s formula remained the primary tool of pi-hunters for centuries (well into the computer era).

Several other Machin-like formulae are known.

<doc id="274757" wikidata="Q1157848" url="?curid=274757" title="Dale Hunter">
<text>Dale Robert Hunter (born July 31, 1960) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and the former head coach of the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League and current co-owner, president, and head coach of the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League. He was born in Petrolia, Ontario, but grew up in nearby (13 km) Oil Springs, Ontario. He is the middle of three Hunter brothers, with older brother Dave and younger brother Mark, to play in the NHL.

==NHL career==

===Quebec Nordiques===
He was selected 41st overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. He would begin his NHL career a year later in 1980 and played seven years with the Nordiques. 

According to his former Quebec Nordiques coach Michel Bergeron, even though Hunter was nicknamed the &quot;Nuisance&quot; on ice (&quot;La Petite Peste&quot; in French), he was known to be &quot;humble&quot; in the dressing room and a sort of &quot;gentleman&quot;, close to all the players. He was the &quot;perfect player&quot;, always the first to arrive at practice and ready to do all his best for the team. Thanks to his charisma, Hunter was a fan favourite in both Quebec and Washington. His leaving Quebec was seen as an obvious &quot;mistake&quot; linked to the team&#x27;s future decline.

At the end of the , Hunter was traded to the Washington Capitals along with Clint Malarchuk in return for Gaetan Duchesne, Alan Haworth, and a 1987 first-round draft pick the Nordiques then used to select future Hall of Famer Joe Sakic.

===Washington Capitals===
Hunter played for 12 seasons with the Washington Capitals, serving as team captain from 1994 to 1999.

In the 1988 Patrick Division Semifinals between the Capitals and Philadelphia Flyers, Hunter scored one of the biggest goals in Caps history. That goal was scored on a breakaway at 5:57 of overtime, beating Ron Hextall and gave Washington the 5–4 win in the deciding game 7.

During the 1991–92 Washington Capitals season, younger brother Mark briefly joined Hunter with the Capitals, playing seven games with the club.

In the 1993 Patrick Division Semifinals between the Capitals and New York Islanders, Hunter led his team with seven postseason goals. That performance was marred by an illegal and potentially career-ending check on Islanders&#x27; star Pierre Turgeon. This illegal check occurred after Turgeon had stolen an errant pass of Hunter&#x27;s and subsequently scored. As Turgeon was celebrating, Hunter came up from behind and checked the unaware Turgeon into the boards, leading to a concussion and a separated right shoulder. As a result of the incident, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the 1993–94 season as part of new commissioner Gary Bettman&#x27;s effort to crack down on violent play.

He played in the 1997 NHL All-Star Game.

Hunter broke the 1,000 points barrier during the , becoming the NHL record holder for requiring the most games to do so by a forward, at 1,308; the record stood until Patrick Marleau achieved the feat in his 1,349th game, during the . Hunter holds the record for the player with the most penalty minutes to have scored 1,000 or more points.

In 1998, he led the fourth-seeded Capitals to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, defeating the Boston Bruins, Ottawa Senators, and Buffalo Sabres in the earlier rounds. In the finals, the Capitals were swept by the defending Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, with the first three games being decided by one goal.

In March 1999, at the trade deadline for the , Hunter was traded back to his original franchise, albeit since relocated and renamed the Colorado Avalanche.

===Colorado Avalanche===
Hunter finished the 1998–99 season with the Colorado Avalanche, the successor to the Nordiques. He helped the team reach that season&#x27;s Western Conference finals, losing in seven games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars. On that team, he often played on the same line as two other renowned pest role playersClaude Lemieux and Theoren Fleury.

Hunter retired at the end of that playoff run, after 19 full seasons in the NHL.

==Post-NHL==

Hunter&#x27;s sweater number (#32) was retired by the Capitals on March 11, 2000. During the ceremony, the Capitals presented Hunter with one of the penalty boxes from the Capital Centre (the Capitals former home arena), symbolic of his exceptional amount of time served for penalties.

In 2000, Hunter and his brother, Mark—also a former NHL player—teamed up with Dale&#x27;s former teammate on the Nordiques, Basil McRae, to buy the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League. Dale became team president and head coach. He led the Knights to the 2005 and 2016 Memorial Cup. On January 1, 2006, the Hunter brothers were named to the 2006 Mayor&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Honours List for Sports by the City of London, Ontario. Hunter&#x27;s older brother Dave Hunter is also a former NHLer. His son Dylan Hunter is an assistant coach for the Knights and his other son Tucker also played for the London Knights before pursuing his education at the University of Western Ontario.

On November 28, 2011, Hunter resigned his position as head coach of the Knights to take the same position with the Washington Capitals, succeeding Bruce Boudreau. His brother Mark then took over as Knights coach. Hunter&#x27;s defense oriented system caused some conflict with star Alexander Ovechkin but it helped the struggling Capitals make the playoffs, where they upset the defending Stanley Cup champions Boston Bruins in the first round before being eliminated by the New York Rangers, both postseason series going to seven games. On May 14, 2012, Hunter announced he was not returning to coach the Capitals in the 2012-2013 season, choosing instead to return to the London Knights.

On May 14, 2019, Hockey Canada named Hunter as the head coach for Canada’s National Junior Team at the 2020 IIHF World Junior Championship. Hunter guided the team to the gold medal with a dramatic come-from-behind victory over Russia in the final game.

==Accolades and controversy==
With amassing a staggering 3565 penalty minutes, Hunter currently has the second-most penalty minutes in NHL history, after Dave &quot;Tiger&quot; Williams (although Hunter played 1,407 games to Williams&#x27; 962). He also holds the NHL record for most penalty minutes in the playoffs, at 731. The Capitals retired his No. 32 jersey. Hunter is the only NHL player ever to score over 1,000 points and rack up over 3,000 penalty minutes (1,020 points and 3,565 PIMs over 1,407 NHL games).

He scored in overtime for Quebec in Game 5 of their 1982 opening round best-of-five series vs. the Montreal Canadiens, and in 1988 scoring against Ron Hextall on a breakaway in overtime for Washington in Game 7 of their opening round best-of-7 series vs. the Philadelphia Flyers, making Hunter the first player in NHL history to score two overtime series-clinching goals in the playoffs.

In July 2006, Hunter was arrested and charged with DUI. The charges were dropped when the presiding judge ruled that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated for unlawful detention and being denied his right to his lawyer.

In September 2005, Hunter was suspended by the Ontario Hockey League for four games after a player left the bench to initiate a fight in an exhibition game.

On January 20, 2006, Hunter was suspended for two games and his team was fined $5,000 for Hunter&#x27;s off ice abuse of the officials. In May 2006, Hunter was fined $5,000 by the OHL for criticizing officials after the Knights were eliminated from the playoffs in four straight games. In September 2006, Hunter was suspended by the OHL for two games after forward Matt Davis left the bench to engage in a fight during a game; OHL rules state that there is an automatic suspension for both the player and the coach if a player leaves the bench to become involved in an altercation.

===Pierre Turgeon incident===
Late in the deciding Game 6 of the 1993 Patrick Division Semifinals between the Capitals and New York Islanders, Pierre Turgeon stole the puck from Hunter and scored, putting the game out of reach. Hunter, who was trailing Turgeon on the play, checked Turgeon from behind well after the goal as he started to celebrate. Turgeon sustained a separated shoulder from the hit, causing him to miss all but Game 7 against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round, as well as most of the series against the Montreal Canadiens in the conference finals. New NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who had earlier promised to crack down on violence, suspended Hunter for the first 21 games of the 1993–94 season—at the time, the longest suspension in league history for an on-ice incident (in terms of games missed).
