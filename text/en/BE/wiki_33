<text>The strength of materials is determined using various methods of calculating the stresses and strains in structural members, such as beams, columns, and shafts. The methods employed to predict the response of a structure under loading and its susceptibility to various failure modes takes into account the properties of the materials such as its yield strength, ultimate strength, Young&#x27;s modulus, and Poisson&#x27;s ratio. In addition, the mechanical element&#x27;s macroscopic properties (geometric properties) such as its length, width, thickness, boundary constraints and abrupt changes in geometry such as holes are considered.

The theory began with the consideration of the behavior of one and two dimensional members of structures, whose states of stress can be approximated as two dimensional, and was then generalized to three dimensions to develop a more complete theory of the elastic and plastic behavior of materials. An important founding pioneer in mechanics of materials was Stephen Timoshenko.

==Definition==
In the mechanics of materials, the strength of a material is its ability to withstand an applied load without failure or plastic deformation. The field of strength of materials deals with forces and deformations that result from their acting on a material. A load applied to a mechanical member will induce internal forces within the member called stresses when those forces are expressed on a unit basis. The stresses acting on the material cause deformation of the material in various manners including breaking them completely. Deformation of the material is called strain when those deformations too are placed on a unit basis.

The stresses and strains that develop within a mechanical member must be calculated in order to assess the load capacity of that member. This requires a complete description of the geometry of the member, its constraints, the loads applied to the member and the properties of the material of which the member is composed. The applied loads may be axial (tensile or compressive), or rotational (strength shear). With a complete description of the loading and the geometry of the member, the state of stress and state of strain at any point within the member can be calculated. Once the state of stress and strain within the member is known, the strength (load carrying capacity) of that member, its deformations (stiffness qualities), and its stability (ability to maintain its original configuration) can be calculated.

The calculated stresses may then be compared to some measure of the strength of the member such as its material yield or ultimate strength. The calculated deflection of the member may be compared to deflection criteria that are based on the member&#x27;s use. The calculated buckling load of the member may be compared to the applied load. The calculated stiffness and mass distribution of the member may be used to calculate the member&#x27;s dynamic response and then compared to the acoustic environment in which it will be used.

Material strength refers to the point on the engineering stress–strain curve (yield stress) beyond which the material experiences deformations that will not be completely reversed upon removal of the loading and as a result, the member will have a permanent deflection. The ultimate strength of the material refers to the maximum value of stress reached. The fracture strength is the stress value at fracture (the last stress value recorded).

===Types of loadings===
*Transverse loadings – Forces applied perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of a member. Transverse loading causes the member to bend and deflect from its original position, with internal tensile and compressive strains accompanying the change in curvature of the member. Transverse loading also induces shear forces that cause shear deformation of the material and increase the transverse deflection of the member.
*Axial loading – The applied forces are collinear with the longitudinal axis of the member. The forces cause the member to either stretch or shorten.
*Torsional loading – Twisting action caused by a pair of externally applied equal and oppositely directed force couples acting on parallel planes or by a single external couple applied to a member that has one end fixed against rotation.

===Stress terms===
Uniaxial stress is expressed by
:formula_1
where &quot;F&quot; is the force acting on an area &quot;A&quot;. The area can be the undeformed area or the deformed area, depending on whether engineering stress or true stress is of interest.

* &quot;Compressive stress&quot; (or compression) is the stress state caused by an applied load that acts to reduce the length of the material (compression member) along the axis of the applied load; it is, in other words, a stress state that causes a squeezing of the material. A simple case of compression is the uniaxial compression induced by the action of opposite, pushing forces. Compressive strength for materials is generally higher than their tensile strength. However, structures loaded in compression are subject to additional failure modes, such as buckling, that are dependent on the member&#x27;s geometry.
* &quot;Tensile stress&quot; is the stress state caused by an applied load that tends to elongate the material along the axis of the applied load, in other words, the stress caused by &quot;pulling&quot; the material. The strength of structures of equal cross-sectional area loaded in tension is independent of shape of the cross-section. Materials loaded in tension are susceptible to stress concentrations such as material defects or abrupt changes in geometry. However, materials exhibiting ductile behaviour (many metals for example) can tolerate some defects while brittle materials (such as ceramics and some steels) can fail well below their ultimate material strength.
* &quot;Shear stress&quot; is the stress state caused by the combined energy of a pair of opposing forces acting along parallel lines of action through the material, in other words, the stress caused by faces of the material &quot;sliding&quot; relative to one another. An example is cutting paper with scissors or stresses due to torsional loading.

=== Stress parameters for resistance ===
Material resistance can be expressed in several mechanical stress parameters. The term &quot;material strength&quot; is used when referring to &quot;mechanical stress&quot; parameters. These are physical quantities with dimension homogeneous to &quot;pressure&quot; and &quot;force per unit surface&quot;. The traditional measure unit for strength are therefore MPa in the International System of Units, and the psi between the United States customary units. Strength parameters include: yield strength, tensile strength, fatigue strength, crack resistance, and other parameters.

*&quot;Yield strength&quot; is the lowest stress that produces a permanent deformation in a material. In some materials, like aluminium alloys, the point of yielding is difficult to identify, thus it is usually defined as the stress required to cause 0.2% plastic strain. This is called a 0.2% proof stress.

*&quot;Compressive strength&quot; is a limit state of compressive stress that leads to failure in a material in the manner of ductile failure (infinite theoretical yield) or brittle failure (rupture as the result of crack propagation, or sliding along a weak plane – see shear strength).
*&quot;Tensile strength&quot; or &quot;ultimate tensile strength&quot; is a limit state of tensile stress that leads to tensile failure in the manner of ductile failure (yield as the first stage of that failure, some hardening in the second stage and breakage after a possible &quot;neck&quot; formation) or brittle failure (sudden breaking in two or more pieces at a low-stress state). The tensile strength can be quoted as either true stress or engineering stress, but engineering stress is the most commonly used.
*&quot;Fatigue strength&quot; is a more complex measure of the strength of a material that considers several loading episodes in the service period of an object, and is usually more difficult to assess than the static strength measures. Fatigue strength is quoted here as a simple range (formula_2). In the case of cyclic loading it can be appropriately expressed as an amplitude usually at zero mean stress, along with the number of cycles to failure under that condition of stress.

*&quot;Impact strength&quot; is the capability of the material to withstand a suddenly applied load and is expressed in terms of energy. Often measured with the Izod impact strength test or Charpy impact test, both of which measure the impact energy required to fracture a sample. Volume, modulus of elasticity, distribution of forces, and yield strength affect the impact strength of a material. In order for a material or object to have a high impact strength, the stresses must be distributed evenly throughout the object. It also must have a large volume with a low modulus of elasticity and a high material yield strength.

=== Strain parameters for resistance ===
* &quot;Deformation&quot; of the material is the change in geometry created when stress is applied (as a result of applied forces, gravitational fields, accelerations, thermal expansion, etc.). Deformation is expressed by the displacement field of the material.
* &quot;Strain&quot;, or &quot;reduced deformation&quot;, is a mathematical term that expresses the trend of the deformation change among the material field. Strain is the deformation per unit length. In the case of uniaxial loading the displacement of a specimen (for example, a bar element) lead to a calculation of strain expressed as the quotient of the displacement and the original length of the specimen. For 3D displacement fields it is expressed as derivatives of displacement functions in terms of a second-order tensor (with 6 independent elements).
* &quot;Deflection&quot; is a term to describe the magnitude to which a structural element is displaced when subject to an applied load.

===Stress–strain relations===

*&quot;Elasticity&quot; is the ability of a material to return to its previous shape after stress is released. In many materials, the relation between applied stress is directly proportional to the resulting strain (up to a certain limit), and a graph representing those two quantities is a straight line.
The slope of this line is known as Young&#x27;s modulus, or the &quot;modulus of elasticity&quot;. The modulus of elasticity can be used to determine the stress–strain relationship in the linear-elastic portion of the stress–strain curve. The linear-elastic region is either below the yield point, or if a yield point is not easily identified on the stress–strain plot it is defined to be between 0 and 0.2% strain, and is defined as the region of strain in which no yielding (permanent deformation) occurs.

*&quot;Plasticity&quot; or plastic deformation is the opposite of elastic deformation and is defined as unrecoverable strain. Plastic deformation is retained after the release of the applied stress. Most materials in the linear-elastic category are usually capable of plastic deformation. Brittle materials, like ceramics, do not experience any plastic deformation and will fracture under relatively low strain, while ductile materials such as metallics, lead, or polymers will plastically deform much more before a fracture initiation.

Consider the difference between a carrot and chewed bubble gum. The carrot will stretch very little before breaking. The chewed bubble gum, on the other hand, will plastically deform enormously before finally breaking.

==Design terms==
Ultimate strength is an attribute related to a material, rather than just a specific specimen made of the material, and as such it is quoted as the force per unit of cross section area (N/m2). The ultimate strength is the maximum stress that a material can withstand before it breaks or weakens. For example, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of AISI 1018 Steel is 440 MPa. In Imperial units, the unit of stress is given as lbf/in2 or pounds-force per square inch. This unit is often abbreviated as psi. One thousand psi is abbreviated ksi.

A factor of safety is a design criteria that an engineered component or structure must achieve. formula_3, where FS: the factor of safety, Rf The applied stress, and F: ultimate allowable stress (psi or MPa)

Margin of Safety is the common method for design criteria. It is defined MS = Pu/P − 1.

For example, to achieve a factor of safety of 4, the allowable stress in an AISI 1018 steel component can be calculated to be formula_4 = 440/4 = 110 MPa, or formula_5 = 110×106 N/m2. Such allowable stresses are also known as &quot;design stresses&quot; or &quot;working stresses&quot;.

Design stresses that have been determined from the ultimate or yield point values of the materials give safe and reliable results only for the case of static loading. Many machine parts fail when subjected to a non-steady and continuously varying loads even though the developed stresses are below the yield point. Such failures are called fatigue failure. The failure is by a fracture that appears to be brittle with little or no visible evidence of yielding. However, when the stress is kept below &quot;fatigue stress&quot; or &quot;endurance limit stress&quot;, the part will endure indefinitely. A purely reversing or cyclic stress is one that alternates between equal positive and negative peak stresses during each cycle of operation. In a purely cyclic stress, the average stress is zero. When a part is subjected to a cyclic stress, also known as stress range (Sr), it has been observed that the failure of the part occurs after a number of stress reversals (N) even if the magnitude of the stress range is below the material&#x27;s yield strength. Generally, higher the range stress, the fewer the number of reversals needed for failure.

===Failure theories===
There are four failure theories: maximum shear stress theory, maximum normal stress theory, maximum strain energy theory, and maximum distortion energy theory (von Mises criterion of failure). Out of these four theories of failure, the maximum normal stress theory is only applicable for brittle materials, and the remaining three theories are applicable for ductile materials.
Of the latter three, the distortion energy theory provides the most accurate results in a majority of the stress conditions. The strain energy theory needs the value of Poisson&#x27;s ratio of the part material, which is often not readily available. The maximum shear stress theory is conservative. For simple unidirectional normal stresses all theories are equivalent, which means all theories will give the same result.

* Maximum shear stress theory postulates that failure will occur if the magnitude of the maximum shear stress in the part exceeds the shear strength of the material determined from uniaxial testing.
* Maximum normal stress theory postulates that failure will occur if the maximum normal stress in the part exceeds the ultimate tensile stress of the material as determined from uniaxial testing. This theory deals with brittle materials only. The maximum tensile stress should be less than or equal to ultimate tensile stress divided by factor of safety. The magnitude of the maximum compressive stress should be less than ultimate compressive stress divided by factor of safety.
* Maximum strain energy theory postulates that failure will occur when the strain energy per unit volume due to the applied stresses in a part equals the strain energy per unit volume at the yield point in uniaxial testing.
* Maximum distortion energy theory, also known as maximum distortion energy theory of failure or von Mises–Hencky theory. This theory postulates that failure will occur when the distortion energy per unit volume due to the applied stresses in a part equals the distortion energy per unit volume at the yield point in uniaxial testing. The total elastic energy due to strain can be divided into two parts: one part causes change in volume, and the other part causes a change in shape. Distortion energy is the amount of energy that is needed to change the shape.
* Fracture mechanics was established by Alan Arnold Griffith and George Rankine Irwin. This important theory is also known as numeric conversion of toughness of material in the case of crack existence.

A material&#x27;s strength depends on its microstructure. The engineering processes to which a material is subjected can alter its microstructure. Strengthening mechanisms that alter the strength of a material include work hardening, solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, and grain boundary strengthening.

Strengthening mechanisms are accompanied by the caveat that some other mechanical properties of the material may degenerate in an attempt to make a material stronger. For example, in grain boundary strengthening, although yield strength is maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately, very small grain sizes make the material brittle. In general, the yield strength of a material is an adequate indicator of the material&#x27;s mechanical strength. Considered in tandem with the fact that the yield strength is the parameter that predicts plastic deformation in the material, one can make informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending on its microstructural properties and the desired end effect. Strength is expressed in terms of the limiting values of the compressive stress, tensile stress, and shear stresses that would cause failure. The effects of dynamic loading are probably the most important practical consideration of the theory of elasticity, especially the problem of fatigue. Repeated loading often initiates cracks, which grow until failure occurs at the corresponding residual strength of the structure. Cracks always start at a stress concentrations especially changes in cross-section of the product or defects in manufacturing, near holes and corners at nominal stress levels far lower than those quoted for the strength of the material.

==Program==
HRIC undertakes individual advocacy and systemic and policy interventions addressing human rights, technology, and legal and administrative reform issues. HRIC&#x27;s core programs and reports address human rights violations affecting China&#x27;s rural population, migrant workers, ethnic minorities, women, and children.

===Domestic advocacy===
HRIC&#x27;s domestic work includes providing support for legal representation and assistance to activists in China. HRIC works with domestic Chinese groups and calls upon the Chinese government to reassess the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.

HRIC supports domestic groups such as the Tiananmen Mothers, connecting Chinese calls for redress to international debates such as lifting the European Union arms embargo on China. HRIC&#x27;s online June 4 Archive documents the history of the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement. HRIC also maintains Fill the Square, an online petition related to the Tiananmen Mothers&#x27; demands.

===International advocacy===
HRIC contributes to multilateral and bilateral human rights policy discussions. HRIC provides briefings and reports to United Nations bodies, international conferences, WTO processes, and the EU-China Dialogue. As of 2006, HRIC submitted over 40 cases of alleged human rights abuses to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; 13 of these cases resulted in decisions, all of which deemed the detentions arbitrary.

HRIC addresses the relationship between corporate social responsibility, trade, and human rights through reports and presentations. HRIC has outlined a best practices matrix for IT companies doing business in China related to information communication technology (ICT), surveillance, and security.

===Online advocacy===
HRIC&#x27;s online advocacy project supports Chinese citizens&#x27; activism and promotes the free flow of information in China using proxy server technology and a biweekly e-newsletter. The project includes six websites with online Chinese publications and advocacy resources.

==Ongoing publications==
&quot;China Rights Forum&quot; is HRIC&#x27;s bilingual semiannual journal. Since 1990, it has covered China&#x27;s human rights developments. Articles are available online.

&quot;China Human Rights Biweekly&quot; () is a Chinese-language biweekly journal.

&quot;Daily News Brief&quot; is HRIC&#x27;s daily news roundup.

==Reports==
HRIC publishes reports and briefings on various human rights issues.

==Funding==
HRIC is funded by private foundations and individuals. It has received support from groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Open Society Institute, the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development, the European Human Rights Foundation, Human Rights Watch, and Asia Watch. In 2006, the New York University School of Law established the Robert L. Bernstein Fellowship in International Human Rights, which supports a fellowship with HRIC.

<text>José Miguel Cotto Vázquez (born June 22, 1977) is a Puerto Rican professional boxer and a four-time regional level champion. He is the brother of six-time world boxing champion Miguel Cotto and the cousin of lightweight contender Abner Cotto.

==Amateur career==
In 1995, as an amateur, he participated at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina, and won a silver medal. A year later, he represented his native country at the 1996 Summer Olympics, where he was defeated in the first round.

==Pro career==
He won the WBC Youth World super bantamweight title on August 20, 2000, a split decision win against a capable young Fernando Velardez (who would later fight Mexican legend Erik Morales for Morales&#x27; WBC Featherweight title).

On July 25, 2003, Cotto was supposed to fight in Phoenix, Arizona. However, his opponent had trouble getting a license to fight, as he had been knocked out recently and was serving a 45-day suspension from another state. The Arizona boxing commission was unable to find Cotto an opponent in time, and the fight got cancelled.

On September 9, at his native Caguas, Cotto finally returned to action, with a first-round knockout win over Johnny Walker. On December 19, he fought Anthony Martinez in Aibonito, winning by an eighth-round knockout.

Cotto moved to Phoenix early in 2004. On April 14 of that year, he stopped Mexican Luis Lizarraga at two minutes and thirty-seven seconds of the first round to win the regional, International Boxing Council (IBC) Intercontinental super featherweight title. He has also won the vacant WBO intercontinental super featherweight title during his fight with Genaro Trazancos.

On August 6, he beat former WBA Bantamweight champion Al Kotey by a ten-round unanimous decision in San Juan. On August 20, 2005, Cotto would have boxed Manuel Medina, with a world title shot at stake. But he was unable to make the fight&#x27;s weight limit and the fight was cancelled.

On January 29, 2005, Cotto knocked out Armando Cordoba in the first round to win the vacant WBO NABO lightweight title.

On January 20, 2006, Cotto knocked Ubaldo Hernandez out in seven rounds at Mayfield, California. On April 8, he received his first world title try, losing a twelve-round decision to Juan Díaz as part of a Pay Per View undercard, for the WBA world Lightweight title in an exciting fight where both contestants threw nearly a hundred punches per round.

In May 2007, he and Prawat Singwangcha (30-3-1, 18 KOs) battled to a twelve-round draw in a bout for the vacant WBA lightweight title.

Cotto then proceeded to fight Canelo Álvarez at welterweight. Cotto got off to a good start and almost knocked out Alvarez, in round 2, Cotto went down after missing a hook. The referee stopped the fight in round 9 after Cotto was trapped in the corner and was taking many flush right hands by Alvarez.

On April 9, 2011, he lost a 10-round unanimous decision to former IBF Light Welterweight champion Paulie Malignaggi, managing to buckle Maligaggi a couple of times.
He was scheduled to face former two time lightweight champion José Luis Castillo on February 11, 2012, though it was cancelled due to Castillo coming in overweight. On April 21, 2012, Jose Cotto beat Eric Cruz (13-8 13 KO&#x27;s) by UD over 10 rounds, knocking the overmatched opponent down twice.

<text>The Webster method, also called the Sainte-Laguë method (), is a highest averages apportionment method for allocating seats in a parliament among federal states, or among parties in a party-list proportional representation system. The Sainte-Laguë method shows a more equal seats-to-votes ratio for different sized parties among apportionment methods.

The method was first described in 1832 by American statesman and senator Daniel Webster. In 1842, the method was adopted for proportional allocation of seats in United States congressional apportionment (Act of 25 June 1842, ch 46, 5 Stat. 491). The same method was independently invented in 1910 by the French mathematician André Sainte-Laguë.

== Motivation ==
Proportional electoral systems attempt to distribute seats in proportion to the votes for each political party, i.e. a party with 30% of votes would receive 30% of seats. Exact proportionality is not possible because only whole seats can be distributed. Different apportionment methods, of which the Sainte-Laguë method is one, exist to distribute the seats according to the votes. Different apportionment methods show different levels of proportionality, apportionment paradoxes and political fragmentation. 
The Sainte-Laguë method minimizes the average seats-to-votes ratio deviation and empirically shows the best proportionality behavior and more equal seats-to-votes ratio for different sized parties among apportionment methods. Among other common methods, the D&#x27;Hondt method favours large parties and coalitions over small parties. While favoring large parties reduces political fragmentation, this can be achieved with electoral thresholds as well. The Sainte-Laguë method shows fewer apportionment paradoxes compared to largest remainder methods such as the Hare quota and other highest averages methods such as d&#x27;Hondt method.

==Description==
After all the votes have been tallied, successive quotients are calculated for each party. The formula for the quotient is

:: formula_1

where:

* &quot;V&quot; is the total number of votes that party received, and
* &quot;s&quot; is the number of seats that have been allocated so far to that party, initially 0 for all parties.

Whichever party has the highest quotient gets the next seat allocated, and their quotient is recalculated. The process is repeated until all seats have been allocated.

The Webster/Sainte-Laguë method does not ensure that a party receiving more than half the votes will win at least half the seats, which can happen when a party with just over half the vote gets &quot;rounded down&quot; to under half the seats. It also does not ensure that a party with a minority of the vote will not win a majority of the seats, for roughly the same reason.

Often there is an electoral threshold; that is, in order to be allocated seats, a minimum percentage of votes must be gained.
===Example===
In this example, 230,000 voters decide the disposition of 8 seats among 4 parties. Since 8 seats are to be allocated, each party&#x27;s total votes are divided by 1, then by 3, and 5 (and then, if necessary, by 7, 9, 11, 13, and so on by using the formula above) every time the number of votes is the biggest for the current round of calculation.

For comparison, the &quot;True proportion&quot; column shows the exact fractional numbers of seats due, calculated in proportion to the number of votes received. (For example, 100,000/230,000 × 8 = 3.48.)

The 8 highest entries (in the current round of calculation) are marked by asterisk: from 100,000 down to 16,000; for each, the corresponding party gets a seat. 

The below chart is an easy way to perform the calculation: 


In comparison, the D&#x27;Hondt method would allocate four seats to party A and no seats to party D, reflecting the D&#x27;Hondt method&#x27;s overrepresentation of larger parties.

== Properties ==
When apportioning seats in proportional representation, it is particularly important to avoid bias between large parties and small parties to avoid strategic voting. André Sainte-Laguë showed theoretically that the Sainte-Laguë method shows the lowest average bias in apportionment, confirmed by different theoretical and empirical ways. The European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003 stipulates each region must be allocated at least 3 seats and that the ratio of electors to seats is as nearly as possible the same for each, the Commission found the Sainte-Laguë method produced the smallest standard deviation when compared to the D&#x27;Hondt method and Hare quota.

=== Proportionality under Sainte-Laguë method ===
The seats-to-votes ratio formula_2 for a political party formula_3 is the ratio between the fraction of seats formula_4 and the fraction of votes formula_5 for that party:
: formula_6

The Sainte-Laguë method approximates proportionality by optimizing the seats-to-votes ratio among all parties formula_3 with the least squares approach. First, the difference between the seats-to-votes ratio for a party and the ideal seats-to-votes ratio is calculated and squared to obtain the error for the party formula_3. To achieve equal representation of each voter, the ideal ratio of seats share to votes share is formula_9. 

formula_10

Second, the error for each party is weighted according to the vote share of each party to represent each voter equally. In the last step, the errors for each party are summed up. This error is identical to the Sainte-Laguë Index.

formula_11

It was shown that this error is minimized by the Sainte-Laguë method.

==Modified Sainte-Laguë method==
To reduce political fragmentation, some countries, e.g. Nepal, Norway and Sweden, change the quotient formula for parties with no seats (&quot;s&quot; = 0). These countries changed the quotient from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;/1.4, though from the general 2018 elections onwards, Sweden has been using &quot;V&quot;/1.2. That is, the modified method changes the sequence of divisors used in this method from (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) to (1.4, 3, 5, 7, ...). This makes it more difficult for parties to earn only one seat, compared to the unmodified Sainte-Laguë&#x27;s method. With the modified method, such small parties do not get any seats; these seats are instead given to a larger party.

Norway further amends this system by utilizing a two-tier proportionality. The number of members to be returned from each of Norway&#x27;s 19 constituencies (former counties) depends on the population and area of the county: each inhabitant counts one point, while each km2 counts 1.8 points. Furthermore, one seat from each constituency is allocated according to the national distribution of votes.

== History ==
Webster proposed the method in the United States Congress in 1832 for proportional allocation of seats in United States congressional apportionment. In 1842 the method was adopted (Act of June 25, 1842, ch 46, 5 Stat. 491). It was then replaced by Hamilton method and in 1911 the Webster method was reintroduced.

Webster and Sainte-Laguë methods should be treated as two methods with the same result, because the Webster method is used for allocating seats based on states&#x27; population, and the Sainte-Laguë based on parties&#x27; votes. Webster invented his method for legislative apportionment (allocating legislative seats to regions based on their share of the population) rather than elections (allocating legislative seats to parties based on their share of the votes) but this makes no difference to the calculations in the method.

Webster&#x27;s method is defined in terms of a quota as in the largest remainder method; in this method, the quota is called a &quot;divisor&quot;. For a given value of the divisor, the population count for each region is divided by this divisor and then rounded to give the number of legislators to allocate to that region. In order to make the total number of legislators come out equal to the target number, the divisor is adjusted to make the sum of allocated seats after being rounded give the required total.

One way to determine the correct value of the divisor would be to start with a very large divisor, so that no seats are allocated after rounding. Then the divisor may be successively decreased until one seat, two seats, three seats and finally the total number of seats are allocated. The number of allocated seats for a given region increases from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;s&quot; + 1 exactly when the divisor equals the population of the region divided by &quot;s&quot; + 1/2, so at each step the next region to get a seat will be the one with the largest value of this quotient. That means that this successive adjustment method for implementing Webster&#x27;s method allocates seats in the same order to the same regions as the Sainte-Laguë method would allocate them.

In 1980 the German physicist Hans Schepers, at the time Head of the Data Processing Group of the German Bundestag, suggested that the distribution of seats according to d&#x27;Hondt be modified to avoid putting smaller parties at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sainte-Laguë/Schepers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; German media started using the term Schepers Method and later German literature usually calls it Sainte-Laguë/Schepers.

== Threshold for seats ==
An election threshold can be set to reduce political fragmentation, and any list party which does not receive at least a specified percentage of list votes will not be allocated any seats, even if it received enough votes to have otherwise receive a seat. Examples of countries using the Sainte-Laguë method with a threshold are Germany and New Zealand (5%), although the threshold does not apply if a party wins at least one electorate seat in New Zealand or three electorate seats in Germany. Sweden uses a modified Sainte-Laguë method with a 4% threshold, and a 12% threshold in individual constituencies (i.e. a political party can gain representation with a minuscule representation on the national stage, if its vote share in at least one constituency exceeded 12%). Norway has a threshold of 4% to qualify for leveling seats that are allocated according to the national distribution of votes. This means that even though a party is below the threshold of 4% nationally, they can still get seats from constituencies in which they are particularly popular.

== Usage by country ==
The Webster/Sainte-Laguë method is currently used in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iraq, Kosovo, Latvia, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. 

In Germany it is used on the federal level for the Bundestag, and on the state level for the legislatures of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. To correct for the deficiency where a party can win a majority of votes but not a majority of seats, in federal elections the law provides such a party will receive extra seats until it has a majority of one.

In Denmark it is used for leveling seats in the Folketing, correcting the disproportionality of the D&#x27;Hondt method for the other seats.

Some cantons in Switzerland use the Sainte-Laguë method for biproportional apportionment between electoral districts and for votes to seats allocation.

The Webster/Sainte-Laguë method was used in Bolivia in 1993, in Poland in 2001, and the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006. The United Kingdom Electoral Commission has used the method from 2003 to 2013 to distribute British seats in the European Parliament to constituent countries of the United Kingdom and the English regions. 

The method has been proposed by the Green Party in Ireland as a reform for use in Dáil Éireann elections, and by the United Kingdom Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2011 as the method for calculating the distribution of seats in elections to the House of Lords, the country&#x27;s upper house of parliament.

== Comparison to other methods ==
The method belongs to the class of &quot;highest-averages methods&quot;. It is similar to the Jefferson/D&#x27;Hondt method, but uses different divisors. The Jefferson/D&#x27;Hondt method favors larger parties while the Webster/Sainte-Laguë method doesn&#x27;t. The Webster/Sainte-Laguë method is generally seen as more proportional, but risks an outcome where a party with more than half the votes can win fewer than half the seats.

When there are two parties, the Webster method is the unique divisor method which is identical to the Hamilton method.

<text>Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative, public manner. Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration, meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, making the number of possible contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software.

Open-source software development can bring in diverse perspectives beyond those of a single company. A 2024 estimate of the value of open-source software to firms is $8.8 trillion, as firms would need to spend 3.5 times the amount they currently do without the use of open source software.

Open-source code can be used for studying and allows capable end users to adapt software to their personal needs in a similar way user scripts and custom style sheets allow for web sites, and eventually publish the modification as a fork for users with similar preferences, and directly submit possible improvements as pull requests.

== Definitions ==

The Open Source Initiative&#x27;s (OSI) definition is recognized by several governments internationally as the standard or &quot;de facto&quot; definition. OSI uses &quot;The Open Source Definition&quot; to determine whether it considers a software license open source. The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Perens. Perens did not base his writing on the &quot;four freedoms&quot; from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), which were only widely available later.

Under Perens&#x27; definition, &quot;open source&quot; is a broad software license that makes source code available to the general public with relaxed or non-existent restrictions on the use and modification of the code. It is an explicit &quot;feature&quot; of open source that it puts very few restrictions on the use or distribution by any organization or user, in order to enable the rapid evolution of the software.

According to Feller et al. (2005), the terms &quot;free software&quot; and &quot;open-source software&quot; should be applied to any &quot;software products distributed under terms that allow users&quot; to use, modify, and redistribute the software &quot;in any manner they see fit, without requiring that they pay the author(s) of the software a royalty or fee for engaging in the listed activities.&quot;

Despite initially accepting it, Richard Stallman of the FSF now flatly opposes the term &quot;Open Source&quot; being applied to what they refer to as &quot;free software&quot;. Although he agrees that the two terms describe &quot;almost the same category of software&quot;, Stallman considers equating the terms incorrect and misleading. Stallman also opposes the professed pragmatism of the Open Source Initiative, as he fears that the free software ideals of freedom and community are threatened by compromising on the FSF&#x27;s idealistic standards for software freedom. The FSF considers free software to be a subset of open-source software, and Richard Stallman explained that DRM software, for example, can be developed as open source, despite that it does not give its users freedom (it restricts them), and thus does not qualify as free software.

== Open-source software development ==

=== Development model ===
In his 1997 essay &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;, open-source influential contributor Eric S. Raymond suggests a model for developing OSS known as the &quot;bazaar&quot; model. Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral, with careful isolated work by individuals or small groups. He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style, with differing agendas and approaches.

In the traditional model of development, which he called the &quot;cathedral&quot; model, development takes place in a centralized way. Roles are clearly defined. Roles include people dedicated to designing (the architects), people responsible for managing the project, and people responsible for implementation. Traditional software engineering follows the cathedral model.

The bazaar model, however, is different. In this model, roles are not clearly defined. Some proposed characteristics of software developed using the bazaar model should exhibit the following patterns:

&quot;Users should be treated as co-developers:&quot; The users are treated like co-developers and so they should have access to the source code of the software. Furthermore, users are encouraged to submit additions to the software, code fixes for the software, bug reports, documentation, etc. Having more co-developers increases the rate at which the software evolves. Linus&#x27;s law states that given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow. This means that if many users view the source code, they will eventually find all bugs and suggest how to fix them. Some users have advanced programming skills, and furthermore, each user&#x27;s machine provides an additional testing environment. This new testing environment offers the ability to find and fix a new bug.

&quot;Early releases:&quot; The first version of the software should be released as early as possible so as to increase one&#x27;s chances of finding co-developers early.

&quot;Frequent integration:&quot; Code changes should be integrated (merged into a shared code base) as often as possible so as to avoid the overhead of fixing a large number of bugs at the end of the project life cycle. Some open-source projects have nightly builds where integration is done automatically.

&quot;Several versions:&quot; There should be at least two versions of the software. There should be a buggier version with more features and a more stable version with fewer features. The buggy version (also called the development version) is for users who want the immediate use of the latest features and are willing to accept the risk of using code that is not yet thoroughly tested. The users can then act as co-developers, reporting bugs and providing bug fixes.

&quot;High modularization:&quot; The general structure of the software should be modular allowing for parallel development on independent components.

&quot;Dynamic decision-making structure:&quot; There is a need for a decision-making structure, whether formal or informal, that makes strategic decisions depending on changing user requirements and other factors. Compare with extreme programming.

The process of Open source development begins with a requirements elicitation where developers consider if they should add new features or if a bug needs to be fixed in their project. This is established by communicating with the OSS community through avenues such as bug reporting and tracking or mailing lists and project pages. Next, OSS developers select or are assigned to a task and identify a solution. Because there are often many different possible routes for solutions in OSS, the best solution must be chosen with careful consideration and sometimes even peer feedback. The developer then begins to develop and commit the code. The code is then tested and reviewed by peers. Developers can edit and evolve their code through feedback from continuous integration. Once the leadership and community are satisfied with the whole project, it can be partially released and user instruction can be documented. If the project is ready to be released, it is frozen, with only serious bug fixes or security repairs occurring. Finally, the project is fully released and only changed through minor bug fixes.

===Advantages===
Open source implementation of a standard can increase adoption of that standard. This creates developer loyalty as developers feel empowered and have a sense of ownership of the end product.

Moreover, lower costs of marketing and logistical services are needed for OSS. OSS can be a tool to promote a company&#x27;s image, including its commercial products. The OSS development approach has helped produce reliable, high quality software quickly and inexpensively.

Open source development offers the potential to quicken innovation and create of social value. In France for instance, a policy that incentivized government to favor free open-source software increased to nearly 600,000 OSS contributions per year, generating social value by increasing the quantity and quality of open-source software. This policy also led to an estimated increase of up to 18% of tech startups and a 14% increase in the number of people employed in the IT sector.

OSS can be highly reliable when it has thousands of independent programmers testing and fixing bugs of the software. Open source is not dependent on the company or author that originally created it. Even if the company fails, the code continues to exist and be developed by its users.

OSS is flexible because modular systems allow programmers to build custom interfaces, or add new abilities to it and it is innovative since open-source programs are the product of collaboration among a large number of different programmers. The mix of divergent perspectives, corporate objectives, and personal goals speeds up innovation.

Moreover, free software can be developed in accordance with purely technical requirements. It does not require thinking about commercial pressure that often degrades the quality of the software. Commercial pressures make traditional software developers pay more attention to customers&#x27; requirements than to security requirements, since such features are somewhat invisible to the customer.

===Development tools===
In open-source software development, tools are used to support the development of the product and the development process itself.

Version control systems such as Centralized Version control system (CVCS) and the distributed version control system (DVCS) are examples of tools, often open source, that help manage the source code files and the changes to those files for a software project in order to foster collaboration. CVCS are centralized with a central repository while DVCS are decentralized and have a local repository for every user. concurrent versions system (CVS) and later Subversion (SVN) and Git are examples of CVCS. The repositories are hosted and published on source-code-hosting facilities such as GitHub.

Open-source projects use utilities such as issue trackers to organize open-source software development. Commonly used bug trackers include Bugzilla and Redmine.

Tools such as mailing lists and IRC provide means of coordination and discussion of bugs among developers. Project web pages, wiki pages, roadmap lists and newsgroups allow for the distribution of project information that focuses on end users.

== Opportunities for participation ==
=== Contributing ===
The basic roles OSS participants can fall into multiple categories, beginning with leadership at the center of the project who have control over its execution. Next are the core contributors with a great deal of experience and authority in the project who may guide the other contributors. Non-core contributors have less experience and authority, but regularly contribute and are vital to the project&#x27;s development. New contributors are the least experienced but with mentorship and guidance can become regular contributors.

Some possible ways of contributing to open-source software include such roles as programming, user interface design and testing, web design, bug triage, accessibility design and testing, UX design, code testing, and security review and testing. However, there are several ways of contributing to OSS projects even without coding skills. For example, some less technical ways of participating are documentation writing and editing, translation, project management, event organization and coordination, marketing, release management, community management, and public relations and outreach.

Funding is absolutely another terrific way that individuals and organizations choose to contribute to open source projects. Groups like Open Collective provide a means for individuals to contribute monthly to supporting their favorite projects. Organizations like the Sovereign Tech Fund is able to contribute to millions to supporting the tools the German Government uses. The National Science Foundation established a Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program to support open source innovation.

=== Industry participation ===
The adoption of open-source software by industry is increasing over time. OSS is popular in several industries such as telecommunications, aerospace, healthcare, and media &amp; entertainment due to the benefits it provides. Adoption of OSS is more likely in larger organizations and is dependent on the company&#x27;s IT usage, operating efficiencies, and the productivity of employees.

Industries are likely to use OSS due to back-office functionality, sales support, research and development, software features, quick deployment, portability across platforms and avoidance of commercial license management. Additionally, lower cost for hardware and ownership are also important benefits.

=== Prominent organizations ===
Organizations that contribute to the development and expansions of free and open-source software movements exist all over the world. These organizations are dedicated to goals such as teaching and spreading technology. As listed by a former vice president of the Open Source Initiative, some American organizations include the Free Software Foundation, Software Freedom Conservancy, the Open Source Initiative and Software in the Public Interest. Within Europe some notable organizations are Free Software Foundation Europe, open-source projects EU (OSP) and OpenForum Europe (OFE). One Australian organization is Linux Australia while Asia has Open source Asia and FOSSAsia. Free and open source software for Africa (FOSSFA) and OpenAfrica are African organizations and Central and South Asia has such organizations as FLISOL and GRUP de usuarios de software libre Peru. Outside of these, many more organizations dedicated to the advancement of open-source software exist.

== Legal and economic issues ==

=== Licensing ===


FOSS products are generally licensed under two types of licenses: permissive licensing and copyleft licensing. Both of these types of licenses are different than proprietary licensing in that they can allow more users access to the software and allow for the creation of derivative works as specified by the terms of the specific license, as each license has its own rules. Permissive licenses allow recipients of the software to implement the author&#x27;s copyright rights without having to use the same license for distribution. Examples of this type of license include the BSD, MIT, and Apache licenses. Copyleft licenses are different in that they require recipients to use the same license for at least some parts of the distribution of their works. Strong copyleft licenses require all derivative works to use the same license while weak copyleft licenses require the use of the same license only under certain conditions. Examples of this type of license include the GNU family of licenses, and the MPL and EPL licenses. The similarities between these two categories of licensing include that they provide a broad grant of copyright rights, require that recipients preserve copyright notices, and that a copy of the license is provided to recipients with the code.

One important legal precedent for open-source software was created in 2008, when the Jacobson v Katzer case enforced terms of the Artistic license, including attribution and identification of modifications. The ruling of this case cemented enforcement under copyright law when the conditions of the license were not followed. Because of the similarity of the Artistic license to other open-source software licenses, the ruling created a precedent that applied widely.

Examples of free-software license / open-source licenses include Apache licenses, BSD licenses, GNU General Public Licenses, GNU Lesser General Public License, MIT License, Eclipse Public License and Mozilla Public License.

=== Legal issues ===
Several gray areas exist within software regulation that have great impact on open-source software, such as if software is a good or service, what can be considered a modification, governance through contract vs license, ownership and right of use. While there have been developments on these issues, they often lead to even more questions. The existence of these uncertainties in regulation has a negative impact on industries involved in technologies as a whole.

Within the legal history of software as a whole, there was much debate on whether to protect it as intellectual property under patent law, copyright law or establishing a unique regulation. Ultimately, copyright law became the standard with computer programs being considered a form of literary work, with some tweaks of unique regulation.

Software is generally considered source code and object code, with both being protectable, though there is legal variety in this definition. Some jurisdictions attempt to expand or reduce this conceptualization for their own purposes. For example, The European Court of Justice defines a computer program as not including the functionality of a program, the programing language, or the format of data files. By limiting protections of the different aspects of software, the law favors an open-source approach to software use. The US especially has an open approach to software, with most open-source licenses originating there. However, this has increased the focus on patent rights within these licenses, which has seen backlash from the OSS community, who prefer other forms of IP protection.

Another issue includes technological protection measures (TPM) and digital rights management (DRM) techniques which were internationally legally recognized and protected in the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Treaty. Open source software proponents disliked these technologies as they constrained end-users potentially beyond copyright law. Europe responded to such complaints by putting TPM under legal controls, representing a victory for OSS supporters.

=== Economic/business implications ===
In open-source communities, instead of owning the software produced, the producer owns the development of the evolving software. In this way, the future of the software is open, making ownership or intellectual property difficult within OSS. Licensing and branding can prevent others from stealing it, preserving its status as a public good. Open source software can be considered a public good as it is available to everyone and does not decrease in value for others when downloaded by one person. Open source software is unique in that it becomes more valuable as it is used and contributed to, instead of diminishing the resource. This is explained by concepts such as investment in reputation and network effects.

The economic model of open-source software can be explained as developers contribute work to projects, creating public benefits. Developers choose projects based on the perceived benefits or costs, such as improved reputation or value of the project. The motivations of developers can come from many different places and reasons, but the important takeaway is that money is not the only or even most important incentivization.

Because economic theory mainly focuses on the consumption of scarce resources, the OSS dynamic can be hard to understand. In OSS, producers become consumers by reaping the rewards of contributing to a project. For example, a developer becomes well regarded by their peers for a successful contribution to an OSS project. The social benefits and interactions of OSS are difficult to account for in economic models as well. Furthermore, the innovation of technology creates constantly changing value discussions and outlooks, making economic model unable to predict social behavior.

Although OSS is theoretically challenging in economic models, it is explainable as a sustainable social activity that requires resources. These resources include time, money, technology and contributions. Many developers have used technology funded by organizations such as universities and governments, though these same organizations benefit from the work done by OSS. As OSS grows, hybrid systems containing OSS and proprietary systems are becoming more common.

Throughout the mid 2000s, more and more tech companies have begun to use OSS. For example, Dell&#x27;s move of selling computers with GNU/Linux already installed. Microsoft itself has launched a Linux-based operating system despite previous animosity with the OSS movement. Despite these developments, these companies tend to only use OSS for certain purposes, leading to worries that OSS is being taken advantage of by corporations and not given anything in return.

=== Government uses ===
While many governments are interested in implementing and promoting open-source software due to the many benefits provided, a huge issue to be considered is cybersecurity. While accidental vulnerabilities are possible, so are attacks by outside agents. Because of these fears, governmental interest in contributing to the governance of software has become more prominent. However, these are the broad strokes of the issue, with each country having their own specific politicized interactions with open-source software and their goals for its implementation. For example, the United States has focused on national security in regard to open-source software implementation due to the perceived threat of the increase of open-source software activity in countries like China and Russia, with the Department of Defense considering multiple criteria for using OSS. These criteria include: if it comes from and is maintained by trusted sources, whether it will continue to be maintained, if there are dependencies on sub-components in the software, component security and integrity, and foreign governmental influence.

Another issue for governments in regard to open source is their investments in technologies such as operating systems, semiconductors, cloud, and artificial intelligence. These technologies all have implications for global cooperation, again opening up security issues and political consequences. Many countries have to balance technological innovation with technological dependence in these partnerships. For example, after China&#x27;s open-source dependent company Huawei was prevented from using Google&#x27;s Android system in 2019, they began to create their own alternative operating system: Harmony OS.

Germany recently established a Sovereign Tech Fund, to help support the governance and maintenance of the software that they use.

== Open software movement ==

=== History ===
In the early days of computing, such as the 1950s and into the 1960s, programmers and developers shared software to learn from each other and evolve the field of computing. For example, Unix included the operating system source code for users. Eventually, the commercialization of software in the years 1970–1980 began to prevent this practice. However, academics still often developed software collaboratively.

In response, the open-source movement was born out of the work of skilled programmer enthusiasts, widely referred to as hackers or hacker culture. One of these enthusiasts, Richard Stallman, was a driving force behind the free software movement, which would later allow for the open-source movement. In 1984, he resigned from MIT to create a free operating system, GNU, after the programmer culture in his lab was stifled by proprietary software preventing source code from being shared and improved upon. GNU was UNIX compatible, meaning that the programmer enthusiasts would still be familiar with how it worked. However, it quickly became apparent that there was some confusion with the label Stallman had chosen of free software, which he described as free as in free speech, not free beer, referring to the meaning of free as freedom rather than price. He later expanded this concept of freedom to the four essential freedoms. Through GNU, open-source norms of incorporating others&#x27; source code, community bug fixes and suggestions of code for new features appeared. In 1985, Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to promote changes in software and to help write GNU. In order to prevent his work from being used in proprietary software, Stallman created the concept of copyleft, which allowed the use of his work by anyone, but under specific terms. To do this, he created the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989, which was updated in 1991. In 1991, GNU was combined with the Linux kernel written by Linus Torvalds, as a kernel was missing in GNU. The operating system is now usually referred to as Linux. Throughout this whole period, there were many other free software projects and licenses around at the time, all with different ideas of what the concept of free software was and should be, as well as the morality of proprietary software, such as Berkeley Software Distribution, TeX, and the X Window System.

As free software developed, the Free Software Foundation began to look how to bring free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. It was concluded that FSF&#x27;s social activism was not appealing to companies and they needed a way to rebrand the free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. The term open source was suggested by Christine Peterson in 1998 at a meeting of supporters of free software. Many in the group felt the name free software was confusing to newcomers and holding back industry interest and they readily accepted the new designation of open source, creating the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and the OSI definition of what open source software is. The Open Source Initiative&#x27;s (OSI) definition is now recognized by several governments internationally as the standard or &quot;de facto&quot; definition. The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens. The OSI definition differed from the free software definition in that it allows the inclusion of proprietary software and allows more liberties in its licensing. Some, such as Stallman, agree more with the original concept of free software as a result because it takes a strong moral stance against proprietary software, though there is much overlap between the two movements in terms of the operation of the software.

While the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application&#x27;s source code, with an executive of Microsoft calling open source an intellectual property destroyer in 2001. However, while free and open-source software (FOSS) has historically played a role outside of mainstream private software development, companies as large as Microsoft have begun to develop official open source presences on the Internet. IBM, Oracle, and State Farm are just a few of the companies with a serious public stake in today&#x27;s competitive open source market, marking a significant shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of FOSS.

=== Future ===
The future of the open source software community, and the free software community by extension, has become successful if not confused about what it stands for. For example, Android and Ubuntu are examples milestones of success in the open source software rise to prominence from the sidelines of technological innovation as it existed in the early 2000s. However, some in the community consider them failures in their representation of OSS due to issues such as the downplaying of the OSS center of Android by Google and its partners, the use of an Apache license that allowed forking and resulted in a loss of opportunities for collaboration within Android, the prioritization of convenience over freedom in Ubuntu, and features within Ubuntu that track users for marketing purposes.

The use of OSS has become more common in business with 78% of companies reporting that they run all or part of their operations on FOSS. The popularity of OSS has risen to the point that Microsoft, a once detractor of OSS, has included its use in their systems. However, this success has raised concerns that will determine the future of OSS as the community must answer questions such as what OSS is, what should it be, and what should be done to protect it, if it even needs protecting. All in all, while the free and open source revolution has slowed to a perceived equilibrium in the market place, that does not mean it is over as many theoretical discussions must take place to determine its future.

== Comparisons with other software licensing/development models ==

=== Closed source / proprietary software ===
Open source software differs from proprietary software in that it is publicly available, the license requires no fees, modifications and distributions are allowed under license specifications. All of this works to prevent a monopoly on any OSS product, which is a goal of proprietary software. Proprietary software limits their customers&#x27; choices to either committing to using that software, upgrading it or switching to other software, forcing customers to have their software preferences impacted by their monetary cost. The ideal case scenario for the proprietary software vendor would be a lock-in, where the customer does not or cannot switch software due to these costs and continues to buy products from that vendor.

Within proprietary software, bug fixes can only be provided by the vendor, moving platforms requires another purchase and the existence of the product relies on the vendor, who can discontinue it at any point. Additionally, proprietary software does not provide its source code and cannot be altered by users. For businesses, this can pose a security risk and source of frustration, as they cannot specialize the product to their needs, and there may be hidden threats or information leaks within the software that they cannot access or change.

=== Free software ===

Under OSI&#x27;s definition, open source is a broad software license that makes source code available to the general public with relaxed or non-existent restrictions on the use and modification of the code. It is an explicit feature of open source that it puts very few restrictions on the use or distribution by any organization or user, in order to enable the rapid evolution of the software.

Richard Stallman, leader of the Free software movement and member of the free software foundation opposes the term open source being applied to what they refer to as free software. Although he agrees that the two terms describe almost the same category of software, Stallman considers equating the terms incorrect and misleading. He believes that the main difference is that by choosing one term over the other lets others know about what one&#x27;s goals are: development (open source) or a social stance (free software). Nevertheless, there is significant overlap between open source software and free software. Stallman also opposes the professed pragmatism of the Open Source Initiative, as he fears that the free software ideals of freedom and community are threatened by compromising on the FSF&#x27;s idealistic standards for software freedom. The FSF considers free software to be a subset of open-source software, and Richard Stallman explained that DRM software, for example, can be developed as open source, despite how it restricts its users, and thus does not qualify as free software.

The FSF said that the term open source fosters an ambiguity of a different kind such that it confuses the mere availability of the source with the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute it. On the other hand, the term free software was criticized for the ambiguity of the word free, which was seen as discouraging for business adoption, and for the historical ambiguous usage of the term.

Developers have used the alternative terms &quot;Free and Open Source Software&quot; (FOSS), or &quot;Free/Libre and Open Source Software&quot; (FLOSS), consequently, to describe open-source software that is also free software.

=== Source-available software ===
Software can be distributed with source code, which is a code that is readable. Software is source available when this source code is available to be seen. However to be source available or FOSS, the source code does not need to be accessible to all, just the users of that software. While all FOSS software is source available because this is a requirement made by the Open Source Definition, not all source available software is FOSS. For example, if the software does not meet other aspects of the Open Source Definition such as permitted modification or redistribution, even if the source code is available, the software is not FOSS.

=== Open-sourcing ===
A recent trend within software companies is open sourcing, or transitioning their previous proprietary software into open source software through releasing it under an open-source license. Examples of companies who have done this are Google, Microsoft and Apple. Additionally, open sourcing can refer to programming open source software or installing open source software. Open sourcing can be beneficial in multiple ways, such as attracting more external contributors who bring new perspectives and problem solving capabilities. The downsides of open sourcing include the work that has to be done to maintaining the new community, such as making the base code easily understandable, setting up communication channels for new developers and creating documentation to allow new developers to easily join. However, a review of several open sourced projects found that although a newly open sourced project attracts many newcomers, a great amount are likely to soon leave the project and their forks are also likely to not be impactful.

=== Other ===
Other concepts that may share some similarities to open source are shareware, public domain software, freeware, and software viewers/readers that are freely available but do not provide source code. However, these differ from open source software in access to source code, licensing, copyright and fees.

== Society and culture ==

=== Demographics ===
Despite being able to collaborate internationally, open source software contributors were found to mostly be located in large clusters such as Silicon Valley that largely collaborate within themselves. Possible reasons for this phenomenon may be that the OSS contributor demographic largely works in software, meaning that the OSS geographic location is closely related to that dispersion and collaborations could be encouraged through work and social networks. Code acceptance can be impacted by status within these social network clusters, creating unfair predispositions in code acceptance based on location. Barriers to international collaboration also include linguistic or cultural differences. Furthermore, each country has been shown to have a higher acceptance rate for code from contributors within their country except India, indicating a bias for culturally similar collaborators.

In 2021, the countries with the highest open source software contributions included the United States, China, Germany, India, and the UK, in that order. The counties with the highest OSS developers per capita from a study in 2021 include, in order, Iceland, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, while in 2008 the countries with top amount of estimated contributors in SourceForge were the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada and France. Though there have been several studies done on the distribution and contributions of OSS developers, this is still an open field that can be measured in several different ways. For instance, Information and communication technology participation, population, wealth and proportion of access to the internet have been shown to be correlated with OSS contributions.

Although gender diversity has been found to enhance team productivity, women still face biases while contributing to open source software projects when their gender is identifiable. In 2002, only 1.5% of international open-source software developers were women, while women made up 28% of tech industry roles, demonstrating their low representation in the software field. Despite OSS contributions having no prerequisites, this gender bias may continue to exist due to the common belief of contributors that gender should not matter, and the quality of code should be the only consideration for code acceptance, preventing the community from addressing the systemic disparities in female representation. However, a more recent figure of female OSS participation internationally calculated across 2005 to 2021 is 9.8%, with most being recent contributors, indicating that female participation may be growing.

=== Motivations ===
There are many motivations for contributing to the OSS community. For one, it is an opportunity to learn and practice multiple skills such as coding and other technology related abilities, but also fundamental skills such as communication and collaboration and practical skills needed to excel in technology related fields such as issue tracking or version control. Instead of learning through a classroom or a job, learning through contributing to OSS allows participants to learn at their own pace and follow what interests them. When contributing to OSS, the contributor can learn the current industry best practices, technology and trends and even have the opportunity to contribute to the next big innovation as OSS grows increasingly popular within the tech field. Contributing to OSS without payment means there is no threat of being fired, though reputations can take a hit. On the other hand, a huge motivation to contribute to OSS is the reputation gained as one grows one&#x27;s public portfolio.

=== Disparities ===
Even though programming was originally seen as a female profession, there remains a large gap in computing. Social identity tends to be a large concern as women in the tech industry face insecurity about attracting unwanted male attention and harassment or being unfeminine in their technology knowledge, having a large impact on confidence. Some male tech participants make clear that they believe women fitting in within the culture is impossible, furthering the insecurity for women and their place in the tech industry. Additionally, even in a voluntary contribution environment like open source software, women tend to end up doing the less technical aspects of projects, such as manual testing or documentation despite women and men showing the same productivity in OSS contributions. Explicit biases include longer feedback time, more scrutinization of code and lower acceptance rate of code. Specifically in the open-source software community, women report that sexually offensive language is common and the women&#x27;s identity as female is given more attention that as an OSS contributor Bias is hard to address due to the belief that gender should not matter, with most contributors feeling that women getting special treatment is unfair and success should be dependent on skill, preventing any changes to be more inclusive.

== Adoption and application ==

=== Key projects ===
Open source software projects are built and maintained by a network of programmers, who may often be volunteers, and are widely used in free as well as commercial products.

Unix: Unix is an operating system created by AT&amp;T that began as a precursor to open source software in that the free and open-source software revolution began when developers began trying to create operating systems without Unix code. Unix was created in the 1960s, before the commercialization of software and before the concept of open source software was necessary, therefore it was not considered a true open source software project. It started as a research project before being commercialized in the mid 1980s. Before its commercialization, it represented many of the ideals held by the Free and Open source software revolution, including the decentralized collaboration of global users, rolling releases and a community culture of distaste towards proprietary software.

BSD: Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) is an operating system that began as a variant of Unix in 1978 that mixed Unix code with code from Berkeley labs to increase functionality. As BSD was focused on increasing functionality, it would publicly share its greatest innovations with the main Unix operating system. This is an example of the free public code sharing that is a central characteristic of FOSS today. As Unix became commercialized in the 1980s, developers or members of the community who did not support proprietary software began to focus on BSD and turning it into an operating system that did not include any of Unix&#x27;s code. The final version of BSD was released in 1995.

GNU: GNU is a free operating system created by Richard Stallman in 1984 with its name meaning Gnu&#x27;s Not Unix. The idea was to create a Unix alternative operating system that would be available for anyone to use and allow programmers to share code freely between them. However, the goal of GNU was not to only replace Unix, but to make a superior version that had more technological capabilities. It was released before the philosophical beliefs of the Free and Open source software revolution were truly defined. Because of its creation by prominent FOSS programmer Richard Stallman, GNU was heavily involved in FOSS activism, with one of the greatest achievements of GNU being the creation of the GNU General Public License or GPL, which allowed developers to release software that could be legally shared and modified.

Linux: Linux is an operating system kernel that was introduced in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Linux was inspired by making a better version of the for profit operating service Minux. It was radically different than what other hackers were producing at the time due to it being totally free of cost and being decentralized. Later, Linux was put under the GPL license, allowing people to make money with Linux and bringing Linux into the FOSS community.

Apache: Apache began in 1995 as a collaboration between a group of developers releasing their own web server due to their frustration with NCSA HTTPd code base. The name Apache was used because of the several patches they applied to this code base. Within a year of its release, it became the worldwide leading web server. Soon, Apache came out with its own license, creating discord in the greater FOSS community, though ultimately proving successful. The Apache license allowed permitted members to directly access source code, a marked difference from GNU and Linux&#x27;s approaches.

=== Extensions for non-software use ===
While the term open source applied originally only to the source code of software, it is now being applied to many other areas such as open-source ecology, a movement to decentralize technologies so that any human can use them. However, it is often misapplied to other areas that have different and competing principles, which overlap only partially.

The same principles that underlie open-source software can be found in many other ventures, such as open source, open content, and open collaboration.

This &quot;culture&quot; or ideology takes the view that the principles apply more generally to facilitate concurrent input of different agendas, approaches, and priorities, in contrast with more centralized models of development such as those typically used in commercial companies.

==Value==
More than 90 percent of companies use open-source software as a component of their proprietary software. The decision to use open-source software, or even engage with open-source projects to improve existing open-source software, is typically a pragmatic business decision. When proprietary software is in direct competition with an open-source alternative, research has found conflicting results on the effect of the competition on the proprietary product&#x27;s price and quality.

For decades, some companies have made servicing of an open-source software product for enterprise users their business model. These companies control an open-source software product, and instead of charging for licensing or use, charge for improvements, integration, and other servicing. Software as a service (SaaS) products based on open-source components are increasingly common.

Open-source software is preferred for scientific applications, because it increases transparency and aids in the validation and acceptance of scientific results.

<doc id="277664" wikidata="Q400083" url="?curid=277664" title="Aharonov–Bohm effect">
<text>The Aharonov–Bohm effect, sometimes called the Ehrenberg–Siday–Aharonov–Bohm effect, is a quantum-mechanical phenomenon in which an electrically charged particle is affected by an electromagnetic potential (formula_1, formula_2), despite being confined to a region in which both the magnetic field formula_3 and electric field formula_4 are zero. The underlying mechanism is the coupling of the electromagnetic potential with the complex phase of a charged particle&#x27;s wave function, and the Aharonov–Bohm effect is accordingly illustrated by interference experiments.

The most commonly described case, sometimes called the Aharonov–Bohm solenoid effect, takes place when the wave function of a charged particle passing around a long solenoid experiences a phase shift as a result of the enclosed magnetic field, despite the magnetic field being negligible in the region through which the particle passes and the particle&#x27;s wavefunction being negligible inside the solenoid. This phase shift has been observed experimentally. There are also magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effects on bound energies and scattering cross sections, but these cases have not been experimentally tested. An electric Aharonov–Bohm phenomenon was also predicted, in which a charged particle is affected by regions with different electrical potentials but zero electric field, but this has no experimental confirmation yet. A separate &quot;molecular&quot; Aharonov–Bohm effect was proposed for nuclear motion in multiply connected regions, but this has been argued to be a different kind of geometric phase as it is &quot;neither nonlocal nor topological&quot;, depending only on local quantities along the nuclear path.

Werner Ehrenberg (1901–1975) and Raymond E. Siday first predicted the effect in 1949. Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm published their analysis in 1959. After publication of the 1959 paper, Bohm was informed of Ehrenberg and Siday&#x27;s work, which was acknowledged and credited in Bohm and Aharonov&#x27;s subsequent 1961 paper. The effect was confirmed experimentally, with a very large error, while Bohm was still alive. By the time the error was down to a respectable value, Bohm had died.

== Significance ==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, physics was dominated by Newtonian dynamics, with its emphasis on forces. Electromagnetic phenomena were elucidated by a series of experiments involving the measurement of forces between charges, currents and magnets in various configurations. Eventually, a description arose according to which charges, currents and magnets acted as local sources of propagating force fields, which then acted on other charges and currents locally through the Lorentz force law. In this framework, because one of the observed properties of the electric field was that it was irrotational, and one of the observed properties of the magnetic field was that it was divergenceless, it was possible to express an electrostatic field as the gradient of a scalar potential (e.g. Coulomb&#x27;s electrostatic potential, which is mathematically analogous to the classical gravitational potential) and a stationary magnetic field as the curl of a vector potential (then a new concept – the idea of a scalar potential was already well accepted by analogy with gravitational potential). The language of potentials generalised seamlessly to the fully dynamic case but, since all physical effects were describable in terms of the fields which were the derivatives of the potentials, potentials (unlike fields) were not uniquely determined by physical effects: potentials were only defined up to an arbitrary additive constant electrostatic potential and an irrotational stationary magnetic vector potential.

The Aharonov–Bohm effect is important conceptually because it bears on three issues apparent in the recasting of (Maxwell&#x27;s) classical electromagnetic theory as a gauge theory, which before the advent of quantum mechanics could be argued to be a mathematical reformulation with no physical consequences. The Aharonov–Bohm thought experiments and their experimental realization imply that the issues were not just philosophical.

The three issues are: 
#whether potentials are &quot;physical&quot; or just a convenient tool for calculating force fields;
#whether action principles are fundamental; 
#the principle of locality.

Because of reasons like these, the Aharonov–Bohm effect was chosen by the &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;seven wonders of the quantum world&quot;.

Chen-Ning Yang considered the Aharonov–Bohm effect to be the only direct experimental proof of the gauge principle. The philosophical importance is that the magnetic four-potential formula_5 over describes the physics, as all observable phenomena remain unchanged after a gauge transformation. Conversely, the Maxwell fields under describe the physics, as they do not predict the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Moreover, as predicted by the gauge principle, the quantities that remain invariant under gauge transforms are precisely the physically observable phenomena.

=== Potentials vs. fields ===
It is generally argued that the Aharonov–Bohm effect illustrates the physicality of electromagnetic potentials, &quot;Φ&quot; and A, in quantum mechanics. Classically it was possible to argue that only the electromagnetic fields are physical, while the electromagnetic potentials are purely mathematical constructs, that due to gauge freedom are not even unique for a given electromagnetic field.

However, Vaidman has challenged this interpretation by showing that the Aharonov–Bohm effect can be explained without the use of potentials so long as one gives a full quantum mechanical treatment to the source charges that produce the electromagnetic field. According to this view, the potential in quantum mechanics is just as physical (or non-physical) as it was classically. Aharonov, Cohen, and Rohrlich responded that the effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields.

Two papers published in the journal &quot;Physical Review A&quot; in 2017 have demonstrated a quantum mechanical solution for the system. Their analysis shows that the phase shift can be viewed as generated by a solenoid&#x27;s vector potential acting on the electron or the electron&#x27;s vector potential acting on the solenoid or the electron and solenoid currents acting on the quantized vector potential.

=== Global action vs. local forces ===

Similarly, the Aharonov–Bohm effect illustrates that the Lagrangian approach to dynamics, based on energies, is not just a computational aid to the Newtonian approach, based on forces. Thus the Aharonov–Bohm effect validates the view that forces are an incomplete way to formulate physics, and potential energies must be used instead. In fact Richard Feynman complained that he had been taught electromagnetism from the perspective of electromagnetic fields, and he wished later in life he had been taught to think in terms of the electromagnetic potential instead, as this would be more fundamental. In Feynman&#x27;s path-integral view of dynamics, the potential field directly changes the phase of an electron wave function, and it is these changes in phase that lead to measurable quantities.

=== Locality of electromagnetic effects ===
The Aharonov–Bohm effect shows that the local E and B fields do not contain full information about the electromagnetic field, and the electromagnetic four-potential, (&quot;Φ&quot;, A), must be used instead. By Stokes&#x27; theorem, the magnitude of the Aharonov–Bohm effect can be calculated using the electromagnetic fields alone, &quot;or&quot; using the four-potential alone. But when using just the electromagnetic fields, the effect depends on the field values in a region from which the test particle is excluded. In contrast, when using just the four-potential, the effect only depends on the potential in the region where the test particle is allowed. Therefore, one must either abandon the principle of locality, which most physicists are reluctant to do, or accept that the electromagnetic four-potential offers a more complete description of electromagnetism than the electric and magnetic fields can. On the other hand, the Aharonov–Bohm effect is crucially quantum mechanical; quantum mechanics is well known to feature non-local effects (albeit still disallowing superluminal communication), and Vaidman has argued that this is just a non-local quantum effect in a different form.

In classical electromagnetism the two descriptions were equivalent. With the addition of quantum theory, though, the electromagnetic potentials &quot;Φ&quot; and A are seen as being more fundamental. Despite this, all observable effects end up being expressible in terms of the electromagnetic fields, E and B. This is interesting because, while you can calculate the electromagnetic field from the four-potential, due to gauge freedom the reverse is not true.

==Magnetic solenoid effect==

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect can be seen as a result of the requirement that quantum physics must be invariant with respect to the gauge choice for the electromagnetic potential, of which the magnetic vector potential formula_2 forms part.

Electromagnetic theory implies that a particle with electric charge formula_7 traveling along some path formula_8 in a region with zero magnetic field formula_3, but non-zero formula_2 (by formula_11), acquires a phase shift formula_1, given in SI units by

:formula_13

Therefore, particles, with the same start and end points, but traveling along two different routes will acquire a phase difference formula_14 determined by the magnetic flux formula_15 through the area between the paths (via Stokes&#x27; theorem and formula_16), and given by:

:formula_17
In quantum mechanics the same particle can travel between two points by a variety of paths. Therefore, this phase difference can be observed by placing a solenoid between the slits of a double-slit experiment (or equivalent). An ideal solenoid (i.e. infinitely long and with a perfectly uniform current distribution) encloses a magnetic field formula_3, but does not produce any magnetic field outside of its cylinder, and thus the charged particle (e.g. an electron) passing outside experiences no magnetic field formula_3. (This idealization simplifies the analysis but it&#x27;s important to realize that the Aharonov-Bohm effect does not rely on it, provided the magnetic flux returns outside the electron paths, for example if one path goes through a toroidal solenoid and the other around it, and the solenoid is shielded so that it produces no external magnetic field.) However, there is a (curl-free) vector potential formula_2 outside the solenoid with an enclosed flux, and so the relative phase of particles passing through one slit or the other is altered by whether the solenoid current is turned on or off. This corresponds to an observable shift of the interference fringes on the observation plane.

The same phase effect is responsible for the quantized-flux requirement in superconducting loops. This quantization occurs because the superconducting wave function must be single valued: its phase difference formula_14 around a closed loop must be an integer multiple of formula_22 (with the charge formula_23 for the electron Cooper pairs), and thus the flux must be a multiple of formula_24. The superconducting flux quantum was actually predicted prior to Aharonov and Bohm, by F. London in 1948 using a phenomenological model.

The first claimed experimental confirmation was by Robert G. Chambers in 1960, in an electron interferometer with a magnetic field produced by a thin iron whisker, and other early work is summarized in Olariu and Popèscu (1984). However, subsequent authors questioned the validity of several of these early results because the electrons may not have been completely shielded from the magnetic fields. An early experiment in which an unambiguous Aharonov–Bohm effect was observed by completely excluding the magnetic field from the electron path (with the help of a superconducting film) was performed by Tonomura et al. in 1986. The effect&#x27;s scope and application continues to expand. Webb &quot;et al.&quot; (1985) demonstrated Aharonov–Bohm oscillations in ordinary, non-superconducting metallic rings; for a discussion, see Schwarzschild (1986) and Imry &amp; Webb (1989). Bachtold &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) detected the effect in carbon nanotubes; for a discussion, see Kong &quot;et al.&quot; (2004).

===Monopoles and Dirac strings===

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect is also closely related to Dirac&#x27;s argument that the existence of a magnetic monopole can be accommodated by the existing magnetic source-free Maxwell&#x27;s equations if both electric and magnetic charges are quantized.

A magnetic monopole implies a mathematical singularity in the vector potential, which can be expressed as a Dirac string of infinitesimal diameter that contains the equivalent of all of the 4π&quot;g&quot; flux from a monopole &quot;charge&quot; &quot;g&quot;. The Dirac string starts from, and terminates on, a magnetic monopole. Thus, assuming the absence of an infinite-range scattering effect by this arbitrary choice of singularity, the requirement of single-valued wave functions (as above) necessitates charge-quantization. That is, formula_25 must be an integer (in cgs units) for any electric charge &quot;q&quot;e and magnetic charge &quot;q&quot;m.

Like the electromagnetic potential A the Dirac string is not gauge invariant (it moves around with fixed endpoints under a gauge transformation) and so is also not directly measurable.

==Electric effect==

Just as the phase of the wave function depends upon the magnetic vector potential, it also depends upon the scalar electric potential. By constructing a situation in which the electrostatic potential varies for two paths of a particle, through regions of zero electric field, an observable Aharonov–Bohm interference phenomenon from the phase shift has been predicted; again, the absence of an electric field means that, classically, there would be no effect.

From the Schrödinger equation, the phase of an eigenfunction with energy formula_26 goes as formula_27. The energy, however, will depend upon the electrostatic potential formula_28 for a particle with charge formula_7. In particular, for a region with constant potential formula_28 (zero field), the electric potential energy formula_31 is simply added to formula_26, resulting in a phase shift:

:formula_33

where &quot;t&quot; is the time spent in the potential.

For example, we may have a pair of large flat conductors, connected to a battery of voltage formula_34. Then, we can run a single electron double-slit experiment, with the two slits on the two sides of the pair of conductors. If the electron takes time formula_35 to hit the screen, then we should observe a phase shift formula_36. By adjusting the battery voltage, we can horizontally shift the interference pattern on the screen.

The initial theoretical proposal for this effect suggested an experiment where charges pass through conducting cylinders along two paths, which shield the particles from external electric fields in the regions where they travel, but still allow a time dependent potential to be applied by charging the cylinders. This proved difficult to realize, however. Instead, a different experiment was proposed involving a ring geometry interrupted by tunnel barriers, with a constant bias voltage &quot;V&quot; relating the potentials of the two halves of the ring. This situation results in an Aharonov–Bohm phase shift as above, and was observed experimentally in 1998, albeit in a setup where the charges do traverse the electric field generated by the bias voltage. The original time dependent electric Aharonov–Bohm effect has not yet found experimental verification.

== Gravitational effect ==

The Aharonov–Bohm phase shift due to the gravitational potential should also be possible to observe in theory, and in early 2022 an experiment was carried out to observe it based on an experimental design from 2012. In the experiment, ultra-cold rubidium atoms in superposition were launched vertically inside a vacuum tube and split with a laser so that one part would go higher than the other and then recombined back. Outside of the chamber at the top sits an axially symmetric mass that changes the gravitational potential. Thus, the part that goes higher should experience a greater change which manifests as an interference pattern when the wave packets recombine resulting in a measurable phase shift. Evidence of a match between the measurements and the predictions was found by the team. Multiple other tests have been proposed.

== Non-abelian effect ==
In 1975 Tai-Tsun Wu and Chen-Ning Yang formulated the non-abelian Aharonov–Bohm effect, and in 2019 this was experimentally reported in a system with light waves rather than the electron wave function. The effect was produced in two different ways. In one light went through a crystal in strong magnetic field and in another light was modulated using time-varying electrical signals. In both cases the phase shift was observed via an interference pattern which was also different depending if going forwards and backwards in time.

==Aharonov–Bohm nano rings==

Nano rings were created by accident while intending to make quantum dots. They have interesting optical properties associated with excitons and the Aharonov–Bohm effect. Application of these rings used as light capacitors or buffers includes photonic computing and communications technology. Analysis and measurement of geometric phases in mesoscopic rings is ongoing. It is even suggested they could be used to make a form of slow glass.

Several experiments, including some reported in 2012, show Aharonov–Bohm oscillations in charge density wave (CDW) current versus magnetic flux, of dominant period &quot;h&quot;/2&quot;e&quot; through CDW rings up to 85 μm in circumference above 77 K. This behavior is similar to that of the superconducting quantum interference devices (see SQUID).

==Mathematical interpretation==
The Aharonov–Bohm effect can be understood from the fact that one can only measure absolute values of the wave function. While this allows for measurement of phase differences through quantum interference experiments, there is no way to specify a wavefunction with constant absolute phase. In the absence of an electromagnetic field one can come close by declaring the eigenfunction of the momentum operator with zero momentum to be the function &quot;1&quot; (ignoring normalization problems) and specifying wave functions relative to this eigenfunction &quot;1&quot;. In this representation the i-momentum operator is (up to a factor formula_37) the differential operator formula_38. However, by gauge invariance, it is equally valid to declare the zero momentum eigenfunction to be formula_39 at the cost of representing the i-momentum operator (up to a factor) as formula_40 i.e. with a pure gauge vector potential formula_41. There is no real asymmetry because representing the former in terms of the latter is just as messy as representing the latter in terms of the former. This means that it is physically more natural to describe wave &quot;functions&quot;, in the language of differential geometry, as sections in a complex line bundle with a hermitian metric and a U(1)-connection formula_42. The curvature form of the connection, formula_43, is, up to the factor i, the Faraday tensor of the electromagnetic field strength. The Aharonov–Bohm effect is then a manifestation of the fact that a connection with zero curvature (i.e. flat), need not be trivial since it can have monodromy along a topologically nontrivial path fully contained in the zero curvature (i.e. field-free) region. By definition this means that sections that are parallelly translated along a topologically non trivial path pick up a phase, so that covariant constant sections cannot be defined over the whole field-free region.

Given a trivialization of the line-bundle, a non-vanishing section, the U(1)-connection is given by the 1-form corresponding to the electromagnetic four-potential &quot;A&quot; as formula_44 where &quot;d&quot; means exterior derivation on the Minkowski space. The monodromy is the holonomy of the flat connection. The holonomy of a connection, flat or non flat, around a closed loop formula_45 is formula_46 (one can show this does not depend on the trivialization but only on the connection). For a flat connection one can find a gauge transformation in any simply connected field free region(acting on wave functions and connections) that gauges away the vector potential. However, if the monodromy is nontrivial, there is no such gauge transformation for the whole outside region. In fact as a consequence of Stokes&#x27; theorem, the holonomy is determined by the magnetic flux through a surface formula_47 bounding the loop formula_45, but such a surface may exist only if formula_47 passes through a region of non trivial field:

:formula_50

The monodromy of the flat connection only depends on the topological type of the loop in the field free region (in fact on the loops homology class). The holonomy description is general, however, and works inside as well as outside the superconductor. Outside of the conducting tube containing the magnetic field, the field strength formula_51. In other words, outside the tube the connection is flat, and the monodromy of the loop contained in the field-free region depends only on the winding number around the tube. The monodromy of the connection for a loop going round once (winding number 1) is the phase difference of a particle interfering by propagating left and right of the superconducting tube containing the magnetic field. 
If one wants to ignore the physics inside the superconductor and only describe the physics in the outside region, it becomes natural and mathematically convenient to describe the quantum electron by a section in a complex line bundle with an &quot;external&quot; flat connection formula_42 with monodromy

:formula_53 magnetic flux through the tube / formula_54

rather than an external EM field formula_55. The Schrödinger equation readily generalizes to this situation by using the Laplacian of the connection for the (free) Hamiltonian

:formula_56.

Equivalently, one can work in two simply connected regions with cuts that pass from the tube towards or away from the detection screen. In each of these regions the ordinary free Schrödinger equations would have to be solved, but in passing from one region to the other, in only one of the two connected components of the intersection (effectively in only one of the slits) a monodromy factor formula_57 is picked up, which results in the shift in the interference pattern as one changes the flux.

Effects with similar mathematical interpretation can be found in other fields. For example, in classical statistical physics, quantization of a molecular motor motion in a stochastic environment can be interpreted as an Aharonov–Bohm effect induced by a gauge field acting in the space of control parameters.

<text>Jack Frost is a personification of frost, ice, snow, sleet, winter, and freezing cold. He is a variant of Old Man Winter who is held responsible for frosty weather, nipping the fingers and toes in such weather, coloring the foliage in autumn, and leaving fern-like patterns on cold windows in winter.

Starting in late 19th century literature, more developed characterizations of Jack Frost depict him as a sprite-like character, sometimes appearing as a sinister mischief-maker or as a hero.

==Background==

Jack Frost is traditionally said to leave the frosty, fern-like patterns on windows on cold winter mornings (window frost or fern frost) and nipping the extremities in cold weather. Over time, window frost has become far less prevalent in the modern world due to the advance of double-glazing, but Jack Frost remains a well-known figure in popular culture. He is sometimes described or depicted with paint brush and bucket coloring the autumnal foliage red, yellow, brown, and orange. According to other customs, he is said to be the husband of Suzy Snowflake.

==History==

Tales of Jack Frost may originate from Anglo-Saxon and Norse winter customs. The Finnish equivalent &quot;Pakkasukko&quot; has an entire chapter named after him in &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish national epic compiled from their ancient oral tradition. In Swedish folklore, the equivalent is &quot;Kung Bore&quot; (King Bore); the name originating from Swedish 17th century writer Olaus Rudbeck.

There are various other mythological beings who take on a similar role yet have a unique folklore to them. In Russia, he has taken on a different form as Grandfather Frost, and in Germany there is instead a different entity altogether known as Mrs. Holle. The Hindu Kush mountain range is named after stories of a resident giant who would kill (&quot;kesh&quot;) those who attempted to pass, and has been compared to England&#x27;s Jack Frost.

The earliest reference to Jack Frost in literature is in the book &#x27;Round About Our Coal Fire, or Christmas Entertainments&#x27; published in 1732.

Jack Frost is mentioned in many songs – such as the wintertime song &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (aka &quot;Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;) – and movies. He has been presented as a villain in some media and a hero in others.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
* Hannah Flagg Gould&#x27;s (1789-1865) poem &quot;The Frost&quot; features a mischievous being responsible for the quieter phenomena of winter, beautiful ice paintings on windows but who also got upset at lack of gifts and caused the cold to break and ruin things.
* In Margaret T. Canby&#x27;s &quot;Birdie and His Fairy Friends&quot; (1874), there is a short story titled &quot;The Frost Fairies.&quot; In this story, Jack Frost is the king of the Winter Spirits and is described as a kind fellow who wants to help children, whereas a king of a neighboring kingdom, King Winter, is cruel to them. The story tells the origins of how Jack Frost began to oversee the coloring of the leaves of the forest in fall.
** In 1891 Helen Keller made her own reproduction of the story, titled The Frost King.
* In Charles Sangster&#x27;s &quot;Little Jack Frost&quot;, published in The Aldine, (Vol.7, No.16, 1875) Jack Frost is a playful being who runs around playing pranks and &#x27;nose-biting&#x27;, coating places with snow before being chased off by Dame Nature for spring.
* In L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot; (1902), Jack Frost is the son of the otherwise unnamed Frost King.

* In comic books, Jack Frost appears as a superhero in works published by Timely Comics ( Marvel Comics) in the 1940s.
* Marvel Comics had a second Jack Frost, the first alias of the original Blizzard.
* Jack Frost is the alias of Dane McGowan one of the main characters from the 1990s Vertigo series &quot;The Invisibles&quot;.

<doc id="277666" wikidata="Q1467987" url="?curid=277666" title="Tomcats (2001 film)">
<text>Tomcats is a 2001 American sex comedy film written and directed by Gregory Poirier. It stars Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Shannon Elizabeth, and Jake Busey. This film also features Dakota Fanning in her film acting debut. It is the first film released by Revolution Studios.

== Plot ==
A group of men, Michael Delaney, Kyle Brenner, Steve and others, are talking before the wedding ceremony of one of their friends. They agree to a pact whereby they will all invest in a fund that only the last bachelor will inherit.

Michael goes to Las Vegas years later with Steve and his girlfriend. After going back to their room, he mistakenly thinks she wants him to say &quot;I love you&quot;. He panics and kicks her out of the room and she dumps him. He goes on a bender and picks up a sultry redhead who encourages him to gamble at the roulette table. He goes on an amazing run of bad luck, losing everything and taking out credit from the casino. In the end, the casino intervenes and he is summoned to meet the pit boss Carlos. Carlos informs Michael how serious the trouble he is in and what will happen if he fails to repay the debt.

Michael realizes that he and Kyle are now the last men standing and stand to inherit the entire fund, which has swelled to an enormous amount. He approaches Kyle and learns that the latter is wealthy and a jerk. He decides that his only option is to set Kyle up so that Michael can inherit the fund. He learns on a drunken night that Kyle has only ever loved one woman, a lady named Natalie, whom he met at Steve&#x27;s wife Tricia&#x27;s sister&#x27;s wedding.

Michael approaches Steve and Tricia and finds out where Natalie is. Unfortunately, they neglect to tell him that Natalie is a police detective. Natalie is working undercover as a streetwalker when Michael finds her and he inadvertently gets himself arrested for solicitation. During interrogation, he admits everything and is eventually released.

Natalie visits him and agrees to go in with his plan on the basis that she gets half the money. He finds out that Kyle&#x27;s memory of Natalie and his night together left out some important details, notably that, when Natalie woke up, Kyle had bolted, leaving her with a bag of quarters to get a cab home.

Michael and Natalie decide to spend time together investigating Kyle in order to ensure their plan works. It all appears to be working until Michael realizes he is falling in love with Natalie. Natalie too is falling for Michael, but decides to go ahead with marrying Kyle. During the bachelor party, Kyle informs Michael that he has no intention of quitting womanizing and believes Natalie to be the perfect stay-at-home wife.

Before Michael can act and prevent the wedding, he is knocked unconscious by a bowling ball. He wakes up and discovers that his clothes are missing. He grabs some clothing from an unconscious stripper and tries to run to the civic hall to prevent the marriage. After a number of misadventures, Michael finally arrives, but learns that he is too late and Kyle has already married Natalie. He leaves, somewhat dejected.

Michael goes on to claim the fund and thereby settles his debt with Carlos. He later bumps into Kyle who is on a date with another girl and punches him as he believes Kyle to be cheating on Natalie. Kyle beats up Michael and then discloses that he has split with Natalie. On their wedding night, she knocked him unconscious and when he woke up, he found a bag of quarters. Michael runs off to find Natalie and finds her again working undercover. He proposes that they date and he gives up his tomcat ways. The pair ultimately marry. Kyle ends up with the librarian Michael was with earlier.

The film grossed $6.4 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, debuting in fourth place. Overall, the film grossed $13.6 million in the United States and Canada, contributing to a $23.4 million worldwide total.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Tomcats&quot; holds a 14% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 77 critic reviews with an average rating of 3.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus is: &quot;Why even bother? You already know if you&#x27;re going to see it or not.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 15 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;&quot;Tomcats&quot; is laced with such rampant misogyny that the laughs stick in your throat.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; said, &quot;The film is enthusiastically vulgar but not particularly funny, perhaps because it too often loses the distinction between gross-out humor and the merely gross.&quot;

<doc id="277667" wikidata="Q219424" url="?curid=277667" title="Scary Movie">
<text>Scary Movie is a 2000 American slasher parody film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and written by Marlon and Shawn Wayans (who both also star), alongside Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra, Shannon Elizabeth, Anna Faris, Kurt Fuller, Regina Hall, Lochlyn Munro, Cheri Oteri, and Dave Sheridan, it follows a group of teenagers who accidentally hit a man with their car, dump his body in a lake, and swear to secrecy. A year later, someone wearing a Ghostface mask and robe begins hunting them one by one.

The film is a parody of multiple genres including the horror, slasher, and mystery film genres. Several 1990s films and TV shows are also spoofed, and the script primarily follows the plot of the slasher films &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. Some films and TV shows like &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; were also parodied in some scenes.

Dimension Films released &quot;Scary Movie&quot; in the United States on July 7, 2000. The film grossed $278 million worldwide on a $19 million budget. It was the ninth-highest-grossing film of the year domestically in the United States. The film is the first installment in the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; film series, as well as being the highest-grossing film in the series. The film received mixed reviews from critics, although it has received more favourable reviews from audiences and has subsequently become a cult classic. It later spawned four sequels, starting with 2001&#x27;s &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;.

== Plot ==

On Halloween night, Drew Decker receives a threatening phone call while home alone. Chased outside by somebody dressed as Ghostface, she is stripped to her bra and panties before being stabbed in the breast, removing one of her silicone implants. Her father, who is distracted by receiving fellatio, accidentally hits her with his vehicle, and she looks at her murderer just before she is fatally stabbed.

Cindy Campbell meets up with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze and her friends, Brenda Meeks, Ray Wilkins, Greg Phillippe, Buffy Gilmore, and Brenda&#x27;s stoner brother Shorty. News teams, including hack reporter Gail Hailstorm, converge on the school because of Drew&#x27;s murder. Gail seduces Buffy&#x27;s intellectually disabled brother, Special Officer Doofy, to elicit information from him.

While in class, Cindy notices the killer watching her from outside before receiving an ominous note and realizes Drew was murdered exactly one year after she and her friends accidentally killed a man by running him over with a car then dumping his body in a lake. After football practice, Greg finds a photo of his small penis on his locker saying &quot;I KNOW&quot; on it. Believing Ray took the photo, he confronts him &amp; their friends.

Cindy tells her friends about the note, attempting to convince them to tell the police, but Greg beats her instead, fearing imprisonment for the murder of the previous year. At Buffy&#x27;s beauty pageant that evening, the killer murders Greg in plain view, while the audience mistakes her pleas for help as part of her dramatic reading. Buffy eventually wins the pageant and forgets Greg.

The killer attacks Cindy while home alone but retreats when she contacts the police. Bobby arrives and is arrested after a cellphone, knife, and gloves fall out of his pocket. As Cindy spends the night at Buffy and Doofy&#x27;s, she receives a call from the killer.

The following day, Bobby is released from jail. Buffy is beheaded by the killer with a cleaver. That night, Gail and her cameraman Kenny go to a makeout spot to get a murder on camera. After they film the killer murdering teenager Heather, he chases them into the woods and murders Kenny. Gail later gives a snot-filled apology to Kenny&#x27;s family, a parody of a scene from &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;.

Later that night, Ray and Brenda go to the movies to see &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, where Ray is stabbed through his ear in a bathroom stall through a glory hole. The killer nearly murders Brenda, but angry movie patrons, weary of her talking during the film and her obnoxious behavior, stab her to death to silence her, as revenge for spoiling several films.

Meanwhile, Cindy has a house party, hoping for safety in numbers. One of her friends, Tina, is killed while getting beer from the garage. During the party, Cindy and Bobby go upstairs and have sex. The killer gets stoned with Shorty and his friends in the basement, but accidentally kills all but Shorty. After the pair has sex, the killer stabs Bobby and disappears. Cindy gets a gun from a drawer and Bobby follows. Shorty comes up from the basement warning about the killer, but Bobby shoots him. Ray arrives on the scene, still alive, with a voice changer.

Bobby and Ray confront Cindy in the kitchen, announcing they will only kill her and her father, and that they are merely copying the real killer. Bobby admits to being gay, while Ray denies it. The plan backfires when Ray stabs and kills Bobby out of anger because his favorite show, &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, has been canceled after five seasons without getting a final episode. The killer abruptly arrives and stabs Ray and fights Cindy until she kicks him out a window, employing moves from &quot;The Matrix&quot;. However, the killer vanishes before the police arrive, to Cindy&#x27;s dismay.

At the police station, Cindy and the sheriff discover that David Keegan, the man the teens killed the previous year was not the killer who came back for revenge but was actually Doofy who was faking his disability and has escaped with Gail Hailstorm after removing his disguise, similarly to the ending of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. Finding his discarded backpack with his Ghostface mask and knife in the street, Cindy begins screaming but is run over by a car as the sheriff walks away.

== Production ==

The screenplay was developed by Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans with Buddy Johnson and Phil Beauman, writers for the sitcom &quot;The Wayans Bros&quot;.
At the same time, Miramax was developing a spoof of &quot;Scream&quot; scripted by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Due to a WGA decision, all six writers were credited, despite Friedberg and Seltzer not actually working on the filmed script.
Anna Faris had graduated from the University of Washington and planned to travel to London, but decided instead to go to Los Angeles and after meeting with some managers; she then auditioned for the film and booked her first acting job. Keenen had rejected many other actresses, and was willing to take the chance on Faris despite her lack of experience because of her instinctual performance. He said: &quot;She had this natural innocence and was funny. 
Jenny McCarthy and Melissa Joan Hart auditioned for the part of Drew Decker, before Carmen Electra was cast.

=== Parodies ===
Much of the humor of &quot;Scary Movie&quot; relies upon specific references to other contemporary films. Roger Ebert remarked in his review that &quot;to get your money&#x27;s worth, you need to be familiar with the various teenage horror franchises.&quot; The two films on which the script is most heavily based are &quot;Scream&quot; (1996) and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997) (both written by Kevin Williamson), using the general narrative arcs of both films, and featuring comedic recreations of key scenes. The backstory in which the teenagers are responsible for accidentally killing a man following a beauty pageant recalls the same plot point in &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. Major references to &quot;Scream&quot; include the identity of Ghostface and the murder of Drew Decker in the opening scene, a reference to the opening scene of &quot;Scream&quot; in which the same thing occurs to the character of Casey Becker, played by Drew Barrymore. Additionally, the characters of &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; are mirrored in the film, and the title &quot;Scary Movie&quot; was originally the working title for the project that would eventually become &quot;Scream&quot;. At one point the title of this film was going to be &quot;Scream If You Still Know What I Did Last Halloween&quot;. Although the Ghostface mask and costume was a replica, the original costume in the &quot;Scream&quot; series was used when Cindy notices the killer outside of the school.

Many scenes and jokes parody or reference other films outside the horror film genre. The fight between Cindy and the killer heavily mimics &quot;The Matrix&quot;, particularly its use of bullet time. The final scene, in which Doofy stops feigning his disability and drives away with Gail, is a takeoff of the final scene of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. When asked about her favorite horror movie, Drew answers &quot;Kazaam&quot; due to Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s acting. Cindy becomes aggressive and roars &quot;Say my name!&quot; during sex with Bobby, similar to the sex scene between Michelle and Jim in &quot;American Pie&quot;. The movie theater scene shows a screening of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; and a trailer for a fictitious sequel to &quot;Amistad&quot; titled &quot;Amistad II&quot; with elements of &quot;Titanic&quot; also appears in the movie theater scene. When Gail and her cameraman are attacked by the killer, she partakes in a parody of the famous scene in &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; where Hailstorm records an apology to her friends&#x27; parents.

The film also makes other pop culture references beyond the scope of film, such as the parodied version of Sarah Michelle Gellar&#x27;s character Helen Shivers in &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; being named Buffy, which is a reference to her character in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Others include a brief references to &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Candyman&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and a parody of the &quot;Whassup?&quot; ad campaign by Budweiser.

The tagline for the movie&#x27;s poster was &quot;No Mercy. No Shame. No Sequel.&quot; When &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; was released a year later, the tagline for the sequel was &quot;We Lied.&quot;

; Films parodied 
* &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997): Main parody
* &quot;Scream&quot; (1996): Main parody
** &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997): Brenda&#x27;s death parodies Maureen Evans&#x27; in the opening theater scene, and Cindy&#x27;s chase scene references CiCi Cooper throwing a bicycle down the stairs, as well as the killer falling over a chair from Sidney Prescott&#x27;s chase scene.
** &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000): Post video of Shorty giving advice what to do in a sequel.
* &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999): Character of Shorty says &quot;I see dead people&quot;.
* &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999): Gail Hailstorm references famous &quot;I&#x27;m so scared&quot; scene. 
* &quot; Halloween&quot; (1978): The scene in which Cindy spots the killer outside her classroom window is a direct parody to the scene from &quot;Halloween&quot;, in which Laurie Strode first spots Michael Myers outside her classroom window.
* &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980): Killer says &quot;ch ch ch ah ah ah&quot;, a famous sound effect in the &quot;Friday the 13th franchise&quot;. 
* &quot; The Shining&quot; (1980): Killer says &quot;Redrum&quot;.
* &quot; The Matrix&quot; (1999): Climax references several fight scenes.

== Release ==
=== Home media ===
&quot;Scary Movie&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on December 12, 2000 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Dimension Home Video banner).

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Scary Movie&quot; opened theatrically in the United States and Canada on July 7, 2000, on 1,912 screens, and debuted at number one at the US box office, grossing $42,346,669 during its opening weekend. It went on to break &quot;Air Force One&quot;″s record for having the biggest opening weekend for any R-rated film. The film ultimately grossed $157,019,771 in the United States and Canada, surpassing &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; as Miramax&#x27;s highest-grossing film in that market. It grossed $121,000,000 in other markets, for a worldwide gross of $278 million.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Scary Movie&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 51% based on 117 reviews, with an average score of 5.50/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Critics say &quot;Scary Movie&quot; overloads on crudity and grossness to get its laughs.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 48 based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; said that the film was &quot;unbounded by taste, inhibition or political correctness&quot; and that &quot;the outer limits of R-rated respectability are stretched, if not shredded&quot;. Leydon concluded the film is &quot;practically guaranteed to make you laugh until you&#x27;re ashamed of yourself&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying it &quot;delivers the goods&quot;, calling the film a &quot;raucous, satirical attack on slasher movies.&quot; However, Ebert was critical of the film for not being as innovative as other films, saying it lacked &quot;the shocking impact of &quot;Airplane!&quot;, which had the advantage of breaking new ground.&quot;

Bob Longino of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; felt that the film&#x27;s crude humor detracted from the film, saying that &quot;Scary Movie&quot; &quot;dives so deep into tasteless humor that it&#x27;s a wonder it landed an R rating instead of an NC-17.&quot; Other reviewers, such as A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, argued that the jokes were &quot;annoying less for their vulgarity than for their tiredness.&quot; Scott remarked &quot;Couch-bound pot smokers, prison sex, mannish female gym teachers, those &quot;Whassssup&quot; Budweiser commercials—hasn&#x27;t it all been done to death?&quot;

Peter Howell of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; wrote that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t just push the gross-out envelope, it folds, spindles, mutilates and mails it to your mama.&quot; He adds, however, that &quot;&quot;Scary Movie&quot; has a nasty side to it that negates much of the humour. Many jokes are just plain sexist, racist, homophobic, violent . . . and not funny. A scene where a woman is knocked to the ground by an angry man who then proceeds to brutally kick her is sickening to watch. The film&#x27;s frequent use of profanity also seems gratuitous, even by these standards, but that may be beside the point. By the time you realize the four-letter word count is running high, the plot itself has become repetitious and forced.&quot;

<text>Walter Olmo (28 November 1938, Alba, Piedmont, Italy – 16 May 2019) was an Italian musician and composer. In 1957 he wrote &quot;Towards a Conception of Musical Experimentation&quot; (&quot;Pour un concept d&#x27;expérimentation musicale&quot;). He advocated avant-garde electronic and contemporary music. In his 1975 he published the essay &quot;La fine della preistoria musicale&quot; (The End of Musical Prehistory).

He attended the Milan Conservatory graduating in piano and composition. He then studied under Mauricio Kagel, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Christian Wolff and Iannis Xenakis in Darmstadt. Then he moved to Accademia Musicale Chigiana, Siena where he studied with Franco Donatoni and Franco Ferrara.

With Piero Simondo, Elena Verrone, Michèle Bernstein, Guy Debord, Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio and Asger Jorn, Olmo founded the Situationist International on July 28, 1957. Following a row with Debord, the Italian Section consisting of Olmo, Simondo and Verrone was expelled in January 1958. However he continued to collaborate with Gallizio, providing his &quot;tereminofono&quot;, a musical instrument he had devised by adapting a theremin, for Gallizio&#x27;s first public exhibition of &quot;Industrial Painting&quot; held at the Notizie Gallery, Turin on 30 May 1958.

During the 1980s, he was a lecturer at the Licinio Refice Conservatory Frosinone.

<text>Magnus Magnusson (born Magnús Sigursteinsson; 12 October 1929 – 7 January 2007) was an Icelandic-born British-based journalist, translator, writer and television presenter. Born in Reykjavík, he lived in Scotland for almost all his life, although he never took British citizenship. He came to prominence as a BBC television journalist and was the presenter of the BBC television quiz programme &quot;Mastermind&quot; for 25 years.

==Early life==
Magnús Sigursteinsson was born in Reykjavík on 12 October 1929, but grew up in Edinburgh, where his father, Sigursteinn Magnússon, was the Icelandic consul. In Scotland his family adopted a British naming convention, and from childhood Magnus used his father&#x27;s patronymic as a surname.

Magnusson lived with his family in John Street, Portobello, an eastern suburb of Edinburgh. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, where he was in the school&#x27;s marching brass band, and at Jesus College, Oxford.

==Career==

===Journalism and television===
After graduating from Oxford he became a reporter with the &quot;Scottish Daily Express&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot;. Between 1962 and 1964 he edited the Saltire Society&#x27;s magazine &quot;New Saltire&quot;. He went freelance in 1967, then joined the BBC. In 1968 he appeared as a storyteller in five episodes of the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;, narrating English translations of &#x27;Stories from Iceland&#x27;. He presented programmes on history and archaeology including &quot;Chronicle&quot; and &quot;BC The Archaeology of the Bible Lands&quot;, and appeared in news programmes. In later years Magnusson wrote for the &quot;New Statesman.&quot;

====&quot;Mastermind&quot;====
Magnusson presented the long-running quiz show &quot;Mastermind&quot; from 1972 to 1997 on BBC1. His catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;ve started, so I&#x27;ll finish&quot;, which his successors continued to use, was said whenever the time for questioning a contestant ran out while he was reading a question on the show. Magnusson made cameo appearances as himself, hosting &quot;Mastermind&quot; in &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot; as well as the children&#x27;s series &quot;Dizzy Heights&quot; and as Magnus Magnesium in &quot;The Goodies&quot; episode &quot;Frankenfido&quot;. He also used his &quot;Mastermind&quot; catchphrase in a television advertisement for cheese.

Magnusson ended his 25-year run hosting &quot;Mastermind&quot; in September 1997, and the original black chair was given to him at the end of the production, passing to his daughter Sally Magnusson after his death.

Magnusson later returned to present a one-off celebrity special, originally broadcast on 30 December 2002 on BBC Two, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the first ever &quot;Mastermind&quot; final. This was a precursor to the main show returning to the BBC with Humphrys as host. Shortly before his death, Magnusson returned to the regular &quot;Mastermind&quot; series to present the trophy to the 2006 champion Geoff Thomas. Sally Magnusson presented the trophy to the next series winner, David Clark, while also paying tribute to her father and his legacy to the show.

===Translator===
Magnusson translated or co-translated a variety of books from modern Icelandic and Old Norse into English. Among these are several works by Halldór Laxness, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist from Iceland, as well as a number of Norse sagas, which he co-translated (with Hermann Pálsson) for Penguin Classics: &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot; (1960), &quot;The Vinland Sagas&quot; (1965), &quot;King Harald&#x27;s Saga&quot; (1966) and &quot;Laxdæla Saga&quot; (1969).

==Awards and charity positions==
Magnusson was given the honorary award of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1989. 

He was elected President of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds at its 94th annual general meeting in October 1995, succeeding Max Nicholson, and held the office until 2000. He was founder chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage from 1992 and founder chairman of the Scottish Churches Architectural Heritage Trust in 1978 (it became Scotland&#x27;s Churches Trust in 2012).

He was Lord Rector of Edinburgh University from 1975 to 1978 and in 2002 he became Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University. The Magnus Magnusson Fellowship, an intellectual group based at the Glasgow Caledonian University, was named in his honour.

==Death==

On 12 October 2006, his 77th birthday, Magnusson was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. His condition forced him to cancel a string of public appearances. He died on 7 January 2007. The Aigas Field Centre has a building named the Magnus House in his honour.

==Family==
Magnusson was married to Mamie Baird from 1954 until his death. They had five children. Their eldest son, Siggi, died in a traffic accident in 1973, when he was struck by a vehicle close to the Glasgow Academy playing fields at Anniesland in the city&#x27;s West End. Their daughter Sally is a journalist, writer and television presenter, and youngest son Jon is a television producer, writer and director.

<text>&#x27; (; feminine: &#x27; ) is a historical title of the German nobility and later also of the Russian nobility, usually translated as &quot;count&quot;. Considered to be intermediate among noble ranks, the title is often treated as equivalent to the British title of &quot;earl&quot; (whose female version is &quot;countess&quot;).

The German nobility was gradually divided into high and low nobility. The high nobility included those counts who ruled immediate imperial territories of &quot;princely size and importance&quot; for which they had a seat and vote in the Imperial Diet.

==Etymology and origin==
The word derives from , which is usually derived from . is in turn thought to come from the Byzantine title , which ultimately derives from the Greek verb () &#x27;to write&#x27;. Other explanations have been put forward, however; Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, while still noting the potential of a Greek derivation, suggested a connection to , meaning &#x27;decision, decree&#x27;. However, the Grimms preferred a solution that allows a connection to &#x27;reeve&#x27;, in which the &quot;ge-&quot; is a prefix, and which the Grimms derive from Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot; &#x27;number&#x27;.

==History==

The comital title of is common to various European territories where German was or is the official or vernacular tongue, including Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Alsace, the Baltic states and other former Habsburg crown lands. In Germany, all legal privileges of the nobility have been officially abolished since August 1919, and , like any other hereditary title, is treated as part of the legal surname. In Austria, its use is banned by law, as with all hereditary titles and nobiliary particles. In Switzerland, the title is not acknowledged in law. In the monarchies of Belgium, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, where German is one of the official languages, the title continues to be recognised, used and, occasionally, granted by the national , the reigning monarch.

From the Middle Ages, a usually ruled a territory known as a (&#x27;county&#x27;). In the Holy Roman Empire, many Imperial counts () retained near-sovereign authority in their lands until the Congress of Vienna subordinated them to larger, neighboring monarchs through the German mediatisation process of 1815, preserving their precedence, allocating familial representation in local legislatures, some jurisdictional immunities and the prestigious privilege of . In regions of Europe where nobles did not actually exercise over the populace, the long retained specific feudal privileges over the land and in the villages in his county, such as rights to peasant service, to periodic fees for use of common infrastructure such as timber, mills, wells and pastures. 

These rights gradually eroded and were largely eliminated before or during the 19th century, leaving the with few legal privileges beyond land ownership, although comital estates in German-speaking lands were often substantial. Nonetheless, various rulers in German-speaking lands granted the hereditary title of to their subjects, particularly after the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Although lacking the prestige and powers of the former Imperial counts, they remained legal members of the local nobility, entitled to whatever minor privileges were recognised at the ruler&#x27;s court. The title, translated as &quot;count&quot;, was generally accepted and used in other countries by custom. 

Many Continental counts in Germany and Austria were titled without any additional qualification. Except in the Kingdom of Prussia from the 19th century, the title of was not restricted by primogeniture: it was inherited by all legitimate descendants in the male line of the original titleholder, the males also inheriting an approximately equal share of the family&#x27;s wealth and estates. Usually a hyphenated suffix indicated which of the familial lands a particular line of counts held, e.g. .

In the medieval Holy Roman Empire, some counts took or were granted unique variations of the title, often relating to a specific domain or jurisdiction of responsibility, e.g. , , (Count Palatine), , , , , , etc. Although as a title ranked, officially, below those of (duke) and (prince), the Holy Roman Emperor could and did recognise unique concessions of authority or rank to some of these nobles, raising them to the status of or &quot;princely count&quot;. But a title with such a prefix did not always signify a higher than comital rank or membership in the . Only the more important of these titles, historically associated with degrees of sovereignty, remained in use by the 19th century, specifically and .

In Russia, the title of &quot;Graf&quot; (; feminine: Графиня, romanized &quot;Grafinya&quot;) was introduced by Peter the Great. The first Russian &quot;graf&quot; (or count) was Boris Petrovich Sheremetev, elevated to this dignity in 1706 for the pacification of the . Then Peter granted six more &quot;graf&quot; dignities. Initially, when someone was elevated to the &quot;graf&#x27;s&quot; dignity of the Russian Empire, the elevated person&#x27;s recognition by the German Emperor in the same dignity of the Holy Roman Empire was required. Subsequently, the latter ceased to be obligatory.

====

A was a nobleman whose title of &quot;count&quot; was conferred or confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor, and meant &quot;Imperial Count&quot;, i.e., a count of the Holy Roman Empire. Since the feudal era, any count whose territory lay within the Empire and was under the immediate jurisdiction of the Emperor with a shared vote in the came to be considered a member of the &quot;upper nobility&quot; () in Germany, along with princes (), dukes (), electors (), and the emperor himself. A count who was not a was likely to possess only a mesne fief () — he was subject to an immediate prince of the empire, such as a duke or prince elector.

However, the Holy Roman Emperors also occasionally granted the title of to subjects and foreigners who did not possess and were not granted immediate territories — or, sometimes, any territory at all. Such titles were purely honorific.

In English, is usually translated simply as &quot;count&quot; and is combined with a territorial suffix (e.g., Count of Holland, Count Reuss) or a surname (Count Fugger, Count von Browne). Even after the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the retained precedence above other counts in Germany. Those who had been quasi-sovereign until German mediatisation retained, until 1918, status and privileges pertaining to members of reigning dynasties.

Notable have included:
* 
* , a title merged into the imperial dignity
* since 26 September 1366 (previously, simply )
* 
* Tyrol as a dominion of the Austrian crown

A complete list of with immediate territories as of 1792 can be found in the List of Reichstag participants (1792).

== Margrave ==

A or &quot;Margrave&quot; was originally a military governor of a Carolingian &quot;mark&quot; (march), a border province. In medieval times the borders of the Holy Roman Empire were especially vulnerable to foreign attack, so the hereditary count of these &quot;marches&quot; of the realm was sometimes granted greater authority than other vassals to ensure security. They bore the title &quot;margrave&quot; until the few who survived as sovereigns assumed higher titles when the Empire was abolished in 1806. 

Examples: Margrave of Baden, Margrave of. Since the abolition of the German Empire at the end of World War I, the heirs of some of its former monarchies have resumed use of &quot;margrave&quot; as a title of pretence, e.g. , Margrave of and Maximilian, Margrave of Baden.

== Landgrave ==

A or &quot;Landgrave&quot; was a nobleman of comital rank in feudal Germany whose jurisdiction stretched over a territory larger than usually held by a count within the Holy Roman Empire. The status of a landgrave was elevated, usually being associated with suzerains who were subject to the Holy Roman Emperor but exercised sovereign authority within their lands and independence greater than the prerogatives to which a simple was entitled, but the title itself implied no specific, legal privileges.

 occasionally continued in use as the subsidiary title of such minor royalty as the Elector of Hesse or the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, who functioned as the &quot;Landgrave&quot; of Thuringia in the first decade of the 20th century. The jurisdiction of a landgrave was a or landgraviate, and the wife of a landgrave was a or landgravine.

Examples: Landgrave of Thuringia, Landgrave of Hesse, Landgrave of , Landgrave of . The title is now borne by the hereditary heirs to the deposed monarchs of Hesse (Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse and Wilhelm, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld), who lost their throne in 1918.
A () is a who was recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor as bearing the higher rank or exercising the more extensive authority of an Imperial prince (). While nominally retaining only a comital title, he was accorded princely rank and, usually, arms by the emperor. An example of this would be the Princely County of Habsburg, the namesake of the Habsburg Dynasty, which at various points in time controlled vast amounts of lands throughout Europe.

== Burgrave/Viscount ==

A , or &quot;Burgrave&quot;, was a 12th- and 13th-century military and civil judicial governor of a castle (compare castellan, , keeper) of the town it dominated and of its immediate surrounding countryside. His jurisdiction was a , burgraviate.

Over time the office and domain to which it was attached tended to become hereditary by Imperial grant or retention over generations by members of the same family.

Examples: Burgrave of Nuremberg, Burgrave of () , Burg grafschaft Colditz.

Initially &quot;burgrave&quot; suggested a similar function and history as other titles rendered in German by , in Dutch as or in English as &quot;Viscount&quot; (); the deputy of a count charged with exercising the count&#x27;s prerogatives in overseeing one or more of the count&#x27;s strongholds or fiefs, as the burgrave dwelt usually in a castle or fortified town. Some became hereditary and by the modern era obtained rank just below a count, though above a &#x27; (baron) who might hold a fief as vassal of the original count.

==Rhinegrave, Wildgrave, Raugrave, Altgrave==

Unlike the other comital titles, Rhinegrave, Wildgrave (Waldgrave), Raugrave, and Altgrave are not generic titles. Rather, each is linked to a specific countship, whose unique title emerged during the course of its history. These unusually named countships were equivalent in rank to other Counts of the Empire who were of status, being entitled to a shared seat and vote in the Imperial Diet and possessing Imperial immediacy, most of which would be mediatised upon dissolution of the Empire in 1806.

* Rhinegrave () was the title of the count of the , a county located between and on the right bank of the Rhine. Their castle was known as the Castle. After the Rhinegraves inherited the Wildgraviate (see below) and parts of the Countship of Salm, they called themselves &quot;Wild-and-Rhinegraves of Salm&quot;.
* When the (a countship named after the river Nahe) split into two parts in 1113, the counts of the two parts, belonging to the House of Salm, called themselves Wildgraves and Raugraves, respectively. They were named after the geographic properties of their territories: Wildgrave (; ) after (&quot;forest&quot;), and Raugrave (; ) after the rough (i.e. mountainous) terrain.
** The first Raugrave was Count I (died 1172). The dynasty died out in the 18th century. Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine purchased the estates, and after 1667 accorded the wife and children of his arguably bigamous (morganatic) second marriage to Baroness , the title of &quot;Raugravine/Raugrave&quot;.
* Altgrave (, &quot;old count&quot;) was a title used by the counts of Lower Salm to distinguish themselves from the Wild- and Rhinegraves of Upper Salm, since Lower Salm was the senior branch of the family.

==In Scandinavia==
The corresponding titles in Scandinavia are (m.) and (f.) and would commonly be used in the third-person in direct address as a mark of courtesy, as in .

==Modern usage in German surnames==
German nobility, although not abolished (unlike the Austrian nobility by the new First Austrian Republic in 1919), lost recognition as a legal class in Germany under the Weimar Republic in 1919 under the Weimar Constitution, article 109. Former hereditary noble titles legally simply transformed into dependent parts of the legal surname (with the former title thus now following the given name, e.g. ). As dependent parts of the surnames (), they are ignored in alphabetical sorting of names, as is any nobiliary particle, such as or , and might or might not be used by those bearing them. The distinguishing main surname is the name following the , or , and the nobiliary particle if any. Today, having lost their legal status, these terms are often not translated, unlike before 1919. The titles do, however, retain prestige in some circles of society.

==Other uses==
The suffix occurs in various office titles which did not attain nobiliary status but were either held as a sinecure by nobleman or courtiers, or functional officials such as the (in a polder management organization).

<text>Politics of the Australian state of Victoria takes place in the context of a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliamentary system, and like other Australian states, Victoria is part of the federation known as the Commonwealth of Australia. 

Victorians, and Melburnians in particular, are considered by some analysts to be more progressive than other Australians. The state recorded the highest &quot;Yes&quot; votes of any state in the republic referendum, same-sex marriage survey and Indigenous Voice referendum. Victorians are said to be &quot;generally socially progressive, supportive of multiculturalism, wary of extremes of any kind&quot;. However, the Liberal Party along with the Nationals at varying points had continuous governance from the 1955 Victorian state election to the 1982 Victorian state election, in part due to the Australian Labor Party split of 1955.

==State government==

The nominal head of the Government of Victoria is the King of Australia, represented in the state by the Governor of Victoria. Legislative power rests with the Crown and the two houses of the Parliament of Victoria. The powers and responsibilities of the parliament are defined in the &quot;Constitution Act 1975&quot;.

The Victorian Government is often referred to as &quot;Spring Street&quot;, a metonym of the street of that name where the Parliament House of Victoria is located in Melbourne.

==Parliament of Victoria==

The Parliament of Victoria is bicameral, consisting of a Lower and an Upper house.

The Victorian Legislative Assembly (lower house) is composed of 88 members of parliament, each of whom represent a single electoral district and are elected using a preferential voting system/Instant-runoff voting. The Legislative Assembly currently sits for fixed four-year terms. The leader of the party with a majority in the Legislative Assembly (or with the confidence of the Assembly) is appointed by the Governor as the Premier of Victoria.

The Victorian Legislative Council (upper house) has 40 members (or MLCs), representing eight electoral regions. Five members are elected for each province using a proportional voting system/Single transferable voting. Prior to 2003, the Legislative Council comprised 44 members from 22 two-member provinces until a 2001 constitutional committee recommended the council be re-organised to the current system.

General elections are held every four years, electing the entire Legislative Assembly and half of the Legislative Council. The last state election was on Saturday, 26 November 2022.

==Federal politics==

Victoria is divided into 38 federal electoral divisions, each represented by a seat in the Australian House of Representatives. Like other Australian states, Victoria is represented by twelve Senators in the Australian Senate, with six of those Senators elected for two three-year Senate terms at each half-Senate election.

==Political parties==
The centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, the centre-right National Party of Australia, and the left-wing environmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria&#x27;s main political parties. Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne&#x27;s working and middle class western, northern and inner-city suburbs, and the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. The Liberals&#x27; main support lies in Melbourne&#x27;s more affluent eastern suburbs and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres. The Nationals are strongest in Victoria&#x27;s North Western and Eastern rural regional areas. The Greens, who won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne.

Victoria is currently governed by the Australian Labor Party, which regained power in the 2014 Victorian state election; the Labor Party have governed Victoria for all but eleven of the past years (1982–1992, 1999–2010, 2014–present). The other major parties are the Liberal and National Coalition parties.

Other current Parliamentary parties in Victorian politics include the Greens, the Libertarian Party, the Animal Justice Party, the Democratic Labour Party (DLP), the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party, and Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation. All state Parliamentary parties except for the DLP and Transport Matters are registered to contest federal elections.

Parties not represented in the Parliament include the Companions and Pets Party, the Health Australia Party, and the Victorian Socialists. Of these four parties, only One Nation is registered to contest federal elections.

==Notable Victorian political figures==

Daniel Mannix: Catholic archbishop and opponent of conscription in World War I.

John Wren: Bookmaker, underworld figure and politician. The famous novel &quot;Power Without Glory&quot; by communist author Frank Hardy was allegedly based on his exploits, although a short TV documentary appearing on &quot;Rewind&quot; showed Hardy&#x27;s portrayal of Wren as a lifelong crime figure was itself politically motivated. Unsuccessful attempts were made to suppress the novel on the grounds of libel, although these backfired and caused the fictional life of Hardy&#x27;s John West to become tangled with Wren&#x27;s in the minds of most Australians.

Robert Menzies: Australia&#x27;s longest serving Prime Minister held office during the 1950s and 1960s. Remembered for anti-communism, extreme devotion to the Queen and Empire, and for a period of particular prosperity and a sense of well-being and stability in Australia.

Henry Bolte: Premier of Victoria from 1955 to 1972, notable for his conservative populist style and for his role in the last judicial execution (the hanging of Ronald Ryan in 1967) in Australia.

Jeff Kennett: Premier from 1992 to 1999. His aggressive reforms and populist style led to a surprise electoral loss in 1999 to Steve Bracks.

Daniel Andrews: Premier from 2014 to 2023.

<doc id="277682" wikidata="Q718929" url="?curid=277682" title="Joey Giardello">
<text>Carmine Orlando Tilelli (July 16, 1930 – September 4, 2008) was an American boxer who was the world middleweight champion from 1963 to 1965. He adopted the name Joey Giardello (the name of a cousin&#x27;s friend) in order to join the U.S. Army while underage, and continued to use the pseudonym throughout his boxing career.

==Early life==
Giardello was born in Brooklyn, but lived most of his life in the Lower Moyamensing area of South Philadelphia. He joined the U.S. Army while underage towards the end of World War II, using a cousin&#x27;s friend&#x27;s name, and volunteered for airborne duty. During his military time, he took part in Army boxing matches, and after his discharge in 1948, began boxing professionally. He continued to use the name he had enlisted under, Joey Giardello, in his boxing career.

==Professional career==
During his early career, he had a scuffle at a gas station which cost him $100,000 in prize fight money and five months in jail.

As a pro, he quickly racked up a 15–1–2 record in his first 18 fights while facing less-than-stellar opposition. His only loss was a decision to undefeated boxer Jimmy Morton. During this time, he fought just three men who had previously won a fight. It caught up with Giardello on January 16, 1950, when he was handed his second defeat by Joe DiMartino, a journeyman with a 6–10 record.

After that embarrassment, he began to face better opposition and by 1951, was beating some of the better middleweight boxers on the Philadelphia scene. On June 4, 1954, Los Angeles-based heavyweight boxer Clarence Henry, who was managed by Mafiosi Frank &quot;Blinky&quot; Palermo, was arrested in New York City for attempting to bribe Oakland middleweight Bobby Jones to throw his June 11 Madison Square Garden match with Giardello. Henry allegedly offered $15,000 to Jones to throw the fight. Once the third-ranked heavyweight contender, Henry was released after posting $2,000 bail and subsequently retired from the ring. Giardello beat Jones in a close decision.

Giardello&#x27;s fight vs. Billy Graham was the next significant bout. The decision first was awarded to Giardello, then later reversed to a decision in favor of Graham, then reversed again, some time later as a result of litigation, in favor of Giardello. This fight is known in boxing lore as &quot;The reversed reversal.&quot;

In 1960, Giardello received his first championship opportunity. On April 20, he faced Gene Fullmer for the National Boxing Association version of the world middleweight title. He missed out on the title when he and Fullmer fought to a draw over 15 rounds.

Giardello lost four of his next six fights, but then came back strong with an 8–1–1 record in his next 10, all of which were over some of the biggest names in the division at that time. One of his wins, a 10-round decision over Henry Hank on January 30, 1962, was chosen as Ring Magazine&#x27;s fight of the year. Then, on June 24, 1963, Giardello upset boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson, and at the age of 33, was finally named as the No. 1 challenger for the world middleweight title.

On December 7, 1963, Giardello faced Dick Tiger in Atlantic City for the title and won a controversial decision in 15 rounds.

He reigned as world champion for nearly two years, winning four fights during that time. On December 14, 1964, he fought &quot;Hurricane&quot; Rubin Carter in a title defense. In the first three rounds, Carter stalked Giardello and was the aggressor, as the champion looked to stay away from Carter&#x27;s left hook. In the 4th round, Carter opened a cut over Giardello&#x27;s left eye and staggered him with several head shots. By the 13th round, Carter had begun to tire, and Giardello began pounding Carter&#x27;s head and body, which continued through the 15th and final round. According to Carter, he dominated Giardello the first ten rounds, but Giardello was awarded a unanimous decision, an event dramatized in the 1999 film The Hurricane. Carter would later revise his claims, admitting he should have fought Giardello more aggressively.

In a rematch with Dick Tiger on October 21, 1965, the Nigerian won a unanimous decision over Giardello in 15 rounds to regain the belt. Giardello was described as &quot;back pedaling for most of the fight.&quot; Giardello fought just four more times over the next two years before retiring.

==Professional boxing record==

==Life after boxing==
After retirement, he went into private business and went back to his real name.
He was an insurance salesman and later joined the Misco International Chemical Company as their New York-Philadelphia-New Jersey distributor. He had married his wife Rosalie in 1950, with whom he had four children. He did work with the intellectually disabled, particularly for St. John of God School Community Services in Westville Grove, New Jersey, where his son, Carman, who had Down Syndrome, lived for ten years. He met the pope and was invited to President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Inauguration. With his celebrity and title, he participated in countless fundraising events for the intellectually disabled and contributed his time and talent to the Special Olympics, founded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. At one event he taught the Special Olympians to jump rope.

He had a small role as a man from &quot;The Syndicate&quot; in the 1975 movie &quot;Moonrunners&quot;.

In 1996, he was invited to a Hungarian TV talk-show, (Friderikusz show) in which he made appearance in Budapest, Hungary, to celebrate Laszlo Papp&#x27;s 70th birthday, that was a honorary invitation because of eastern communist block did not let Papp to match with Giardello in 1966, therefore Giardello could keep holding the 2 world titles, while Laszlo Papp was forced by the communist Hungarian government to bring his boxing career to an end.

He later filed a federal lawsuit against Universal Pictures, Beacon Communications and Aloof Films, for unspecified damages, for its &quot;thoroughly false depiction&quot; of his bout with Rubin Carter in Norman Jewison&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;The Hurricane&quot;. The case was settled out-of-court and the DVD version of the film included scenes from the actual fight, as well as Jewison&#x27;s statement that Giardello &quot;no doubt&quot; was a great fighter.

He died on September 4, 2008, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He was 78 years old.

==Honors==
Giardello was inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2009, the 3rd boxer to be inducted after Joe Frazier (2004) and Tommy Loughran (2008). He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993. His career record was 101 wins, 25 losses and 7 draws. He was 5-3-1 against other boxers in the Hall of Fame, including a 2–2 mark against Tiger.

A public statue honoring Giardello is situated in the East Passyunk Crossing section of South Philadelphia.

<doc id="277683" wikidata="Q116293" url="?curid=277683" title="Highest averages method">
<text>The highest averages, divisor, or divide-and-round methods are a family of apportionment rules, i.e. algorithms for fair division of seats in a legislature between several groups (like political parties or states). More generally, divisor methods are used to round shares of a total to a fraction with a fixed denominator (e.g. percentage points, which must add up to 100).

The methods aim to treat voters equally by ensuring legislators represent an equal number of voters by ensuring every party has the same seats-to-votes ratio (or &quot;divisor&quot;). Such methods divide the number of votes by the number of votes needed to win a seat. The final apportionment. In doing so, the method approximately maintains proportional representation, meaning that a party with e.g. twice as many votes will win about twice as many seats.

The divisor methods are generally preferred by social choice theorists and mathematicians to the largest remainder methods, as they produce more-proportional results by most metrics and are less susceptible to apportionment paradoxes. In particular, divisor methods avoid the population paradox and spoiler effects, unlike the largest remainder methods.

== History ==

Divisor methods were first invented by Thomas Jefferson to comply with a constitutional requirement, that states have at most one representative per 30,000 people. His solution was to divide each state&#x27;s population by 30,000 before rounding down.

Apportionment would become a major topic of debate in Congress, especially after the discovery of pathologies in many superficially-reasonable rounding rules. Similar debates would appear in Europe after the adoption of proportional representation, typically as a result of large parties attempting to introduce thresholds and other barriers to entry for small parties. Such apportionments often have substantial consequences, as in the 1870 reapportionment, when Congress used an ad-hoc apportionment to favor Republican states. Had each state&#x27;s electoral vote total been exactly equal to its entitlement, or had Congress used Webster&#x27;s method or a largest remainders method (as it had since 1840), the 1876 election would have gone to Tilden instead of Hayes.

The two names for these methods—highest averages and divisors—reflect two different ways of thinking about them, and their two independent inventions. However, both procedures are equivalent and give the same answer.

Divisor methods are based on rounding rules, defined using a &quot;signpost sequence&quot; &quot;,&quot; where &quot;.&quot; Each signpost marks the boundary between natural numbers, with numbers being rounded down if and only if they are less than the signpost.

=== Divisor procedure ===
The divisor procedure apportions seats by searching for a &quot;divisor&quot; or &quot;electoral quota&quot;. This divisor can be thought of as the number of votes a party needs to earn one additional seat in the legislature, the ideal population of a congressional district, or the number of voters represented by each legislator.

If each legislator represented an equal number of voters, the number of seats for each state could be found by dividing the population by the divisor. However, seat allocations must be whole numbers, so to find the apportionment for a given state we must round (using the signpost sequence) after dividing. Thus, each party&#x27;s apportionment is given by:

formula_1

Usually, the divisor is initially set to equal the Hare quota. However, this procedure may assign too many or too few seats. In this case the apportionments for each state will not add up to the total legislature size. A feasible divisor can be found by trial and error.

=== Highest averages procedure ===
With the highest averages algorithm, every party begins with 0 seats. Then, at each iteration, we allocate a seat to the party with the &quot;highest vote average,&quot; i.e. the party with the most votes per seat&quot;.&quot; This method proceeds until all seats are allocated.

However, it is unclear whether it is better to look at the vote average &quot;before&quot; assigning the seat, what the average will be &quot;after&quot; assigning the seat, or if we should compromise with a continuity correction. These approaches each give slightly different apportionments. In general, we can define the averages using the signpost sequence:

formula_2

With the highest averages procedure, every party begins with 0 seats. Then, at each iteration, we allocate a seat to the party with the &quot;highest vote average,&quot; i.e. the party with the most votes per seat&quot;.&quot; This method proceeds until all seats are allocated.

== Specific methods ==
While all divisor methods share the same general procedure, they differ in the choice of signpost sequence and therefore rounding rule. Note that for methods where the first signpost is zero, every party with at least one vote will receive a seat before any party receives a second seat; in practice, this typically means that every party must receive at least one seat, unless disqualified by some electoral threshold.
===Jefferson (D&#x27;Hondt) method===
Thomas Jefferson was the first to propose a divisor method, in 1792; it was later independently developed by Belgian political scientist Victor d&#x27;Hondt in 1878. It assigns the representative to the list that would be most underrepresented at the end of the round. It remains the most-common method for proportional representation to this day.

Jefferson&#x27;s method uses the sequence formula_3, i.e. (1, 2, 3, ...), which means it will always round a party&#x27;s apportionment down.

Jefferson&#x27;s apportionment never falls below the lower end of the ideal frame, and it minimizes the worst-case overrepresentation in the legislature. However, it performs poorly when judged by most other metrics of proportionality. The rule typically gives large parties an excessive number of seats, with their seat share often exceeding their entitlement rounded up.

This pathology led to widespread mockery of Jefferson&#x27;s method when it was learned Jefferson&#x27;s method could &quot;round&quot; New York&#x27;s apportionment of 40.5 up to 42, with Senator Mahlon Dickerson saying the extra seat must come from the &quot;ghosts of departed representatives&quot;.

===Adams&#x27; method===
Adams&#x27; method was conceived of by John Quincy Adams after noticing Jefferson&#x27;s method allocated too few seats to smaller states. It can be described as the inverse of Jefferson&#x27;s method; it awards a seat to the party that has the most votes per seat &quot;before&quot; the new seat is added. The divisor function is , which is equivalent to always rounding up.

Adams&#x27; apportionment never exceeds the upper end of the ideal frame, and minimizes the worst-case underrepresentation. However, like Jefferson&#x27;s method, Adams&#x27; method performs poorly according to most metrics of proportionality. It also often violates the lower seat quota.

Adams&#x27; method was suggested as part of the Cambridge compromise for apportionment of European parliament seats to member states, with the aim of satisfying degressive proportionality.

===Webster (Sainte-Laguë) method===
The Sainte-Laguë or Webster method, first described in 1832 by American statesman and senator Daniel Webster and later independently in 1910 by the French mathematician André Sainte-Lague, uses the fencepost sequence (i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5); this corresponds to the standard rounding rule. Equivalently, the odd integers (1, 3, 5...) can be used to calculate the averages instead.

The Webster method produces more proportional apportionments than Jefferson&#x27;s by almost every metric of misrepresentation. As such, it is typically preferred to D&#x27;Hondt by political scientists and mathematicians, at least in situations where manipulation is difficult or unlikely (as in large parliaments). It is also notable for minimizing seat bias even when dealing with parties that win very small numbers of seats. The Webster method can theoretically violate the ideal frame, although this is extremely rare for even moderately-large parliaments; it has never been observed to violate quota in any United States congressional apportionment.

In small districts with no threshold, parties can manipulate Webster by splitting into many lists, each of which wins a full seat with less than a Hare quota&#x27;s worth of votes. This is often addressed by modifying the first divisor to be slightly larger (often a value of 0.7 or 1), which creates an implicit threshold.

=== Huntington–Hill method ===

In the Huntington–Hill method, the signpost sequence is , the geometric mean of the neighboring numbers. Conceptually, this method rounds to the integer that has the smallest relative (percent) difference. For example, the difference between 2.47 and 3 is about 19%, while the difference from 2 is about 21%, so 2.47 is rounded up. This method is used for allotting seats in the US House of Representatives among the states.

The Huntington-Hill method tends to produce very similar results to the Webster method, except that it guarantees every state or party at least one seat (see ). When first used to assign seats in the House, the two methods produced identical results; in their second use, they differed only in assigning a single seat to Michigan or Arkansas.

== Comparison of properties ==

=== Zero-seat apportionments ===
Huntington-Hill, Dean, and Adams&#x27; method all have a value of 0 for the first fencepost, giving an average of ∞. Thus, without a threshold, all parties that have received at least one vote will also receive at least one seat. This property can be desirable (as when apportioning seats to states) or undesirable (as when apportioning seats to party lists in an election), in which case the first divisor may be adjusted to create a natural threshold.

=== Bias ===
There are many metrics of seat bias. While the Webster method is sometimes described as &quot;uniquely&quot; unbiased, this uniqueness property relies on a technical definition of bias, which is defined as the average difference between a state&#x27;s number of seats and its seat entitlement. In other words, a method is called unbiased if the number of seats a state receives is, on average across many elections, equal to its seat entitlement.

By this definition, the Webster method is the least-biased apportionment method, while Huntington-Hill exhibits a mild bias towards smaller parties. However, other researchers have noted that slightly different definitions of bias, generally based on &quot;percent&quot; errors, find the opposite result (The Huntington-Hill method is unbiased, while the Webster method is slightly biased towards large parties).

In practice, the difference between these definitions is small when handling parties or states with more than one seat. Thus, both the Huntington-Hill and Webster methods can be considered unbiased or low-bias methods (unlike the Jefferson or Adams methods). A 1929 report to Congress by the National Academy of Sciences recommended the Huntington-Hill method, while the Supreme Court has ruled the choice to be a matter of opinion.

==Comparison and examples==

=== Example: Jefferson ===
The following example shows how Jefferson&#x27;s method can differ substantially from less-biased methods such as Webster. In this election, the largest party wins 46% of the vote, but takes 52.5% of the seats, enough to win a majority outright against a coalition of all other parties (which together reach 54% of the vote). Moreover, it does this in violation of quota: the largest party is entitled only to 9.7 seats, but it wins 11 regardless. The largest congressional district is nearly twice the size of the smallest district. The Webster method shows none of these properties, with a maximum error of 22.6%.
=== Example: Adams ===
The following example shows a case where Adams&#x27; method fails to give a majority to a party winning 55% of the vote, again in violation of their quota entitlement.

=== Example: All systems ===
The following shows a worked-out example for all voting systems. Notice how Huntington-Hill and Adams&#x27; methods give every party one seat before assigning any more, unlike Webster or Jefferson.
=== Stationary calculator ===
The following table calculates the apportionment for any stationary signpost function. In other words, it rounds an apportionment if the vote average is above the selected bar.


== Properties ==

=== Monotonicity ===
Divisor methods are generally preferred by mathematicians to largest remainder methods because they are less susceptible to apportionment paradoxes. In particular, divisor methods satisfy population monotonicity, i.e. voting &quot;for&quot; a party can never cause it to &quot;lose&quot; seats. Such population paradoxes occur by increasing the electoral quota, which can cause different states&#x27; remainders to respond erratically. Divisor methods also satisfy resource or house monotonicity, which says that increasing the number of seats in a legislature should not cause a state to lose a seat.

=== Min-Max inequality ===
Every divisor method can be defined using the min-max inequality. Letting brackets denote array indexing, an allocation is valid if-and-only-if:In other words, it is impossible to lower the highest vote average by reassigning a seat from one party to another. Every number in this range is a possible divisor. If the inequality is strict, the solution is unique; otherwise, there is an exactly tied vote in the final apportionment stage.

== Method families ==
The divisor methods described above can be generalized into families.

=== Generalized average ===
In general, it is possible to construct an apportionment method from any generalized average function, by defining the signpost function as .

==== Stationary family ====
A divisor method is called stationary if for some real number formula_4, its signposts are of the form formula_5. The Adams, Webster, and d&#x27;Hondt methods are stationary, while Dean and Huntington-Hill are not. A stationary method corresponds to rounding numbers up if they exceed the weighted arithmetic mean of and . Smaller values of are friendlier to smaller parties.

Danish elections allocate leveling seats at the province level using-member constituencies. It divides the number of votes received by a party in a multi-member constituency by 0.33, 1.33, 2.33, 3.33 etc. The fencepost sequence is given by ; this aims to allocate seats closer to equally, rather than exactly proportionally.

==== Power mean family ====
The power mean family of divisor methods includes the Adams, Huntington-Hill, Webster, Dean, and Jefferson methods (either directly or as limits). For a given constant , the power mean method has signpost function . The Huntington-Hill method corresponds to the limit as tends to 0, while Adams and Jefferson represent the limits as tends to negative or positive infinity.

The family also includes the less-common Dean&#x27;s method for , which corresponds to the harmonic mean. Dean&#x27;s method is equivalent to &quot;rounding to the nearest average&quot;—every state has its seat count rounded in a way that minimizes the difference between the average district size and the ideal district size. For example:The 1830 representative population of Massachusetts was 610,408: if it received 12 seats its average constituency size would be 50,867; if it received 13 it would be 46,954. So, if the divisor were 47,700 as Polk proposed, Massachusetts should receive 13 seats because 46,954 is closer to 47,700 than is 50,867.Rounding to the vote average with the smallest relative error once again yields the Huntington-Hill method because , i.e. relative differences are reversible. This fact was central to Edward V. Huntington&#x27;s use of relative (instead of absolute) errors in measuring misrepresentation, and to his advocacy for Hill&#x27;s rule: Huntington argued the choice of apportionment method should not depend on how the equation for equal representation is rearranged, and only the relative error (minimized by Hill&#x27;s rule) satisfies this property.

==== Stolarsky mean family ====
Similarly, the Stolarsky mean can be used to define a family of divisor methods that minimizes the generalized entropy index of misrepresentation. This family includes the logarithmic mean, the geometric mean, the identric mean and the arithmetic mean. The Stolarsky means can be justified as minimizing these misrepresentation metrics, which are of major importance in the study of information theory.

== Modifications ==
=== Thresholds ===

Many countries have electoral thresholds for representation, where parties must win a specified fraction of the vote in order to be represented; parties with fewer votes than the threshold requires for representation are eliminated. Other countries modify the first divisor to introduce a &quot;natural threshold&quot;; when using the Webster method, the first divisor is often set to 0.7 or 1.0 (the latter being called the &quot;full-seat modification&quot;).

=== Majority-preservation clause ===
A majority-preservation clause guarantees any party winning a majority of the vote will receive at least half the seats in a legislature. Without such a clause, it is possible for a party with slightly more than half the vote to receive just barely less than half the seats (if using a method other than D&#x27;Hondt). This is typically accomplished by adding seats to the legislature until an apportionment that preserves the majority for a parliament is found.

=== Quota-capped divisor method ===
A &quot;quota-capped divisor method&quot; is an apportionment method where we begin by assigning every state its lower quota of seats. Then, we add seats one-by-one to the state with the highest votes-per-seat average, so long as adding an additional seat does not result in the state exceeding its upper quota. However, quota-capped divisor methods violate the participation criterion (also called population monotonicity)—it is possible for a party to &quot;lose&quot; a seat as a result of winning &quot;more&quot; votes.

<text>Piero Simondo (25 August 1928 – 6 November 2020) was an Italian artist born in Cosio di Arroscia, Liguria, Italy.

<text>Bhagwan Das (12 January 1869 – 18 September 1958) was an Indian Theosophist and public figure. For a time he served in the Central Legislative Assembly of British India. He became allied with the Hindustani Culture Society and was active in opposing rioting as a form of protest. As an advocate for national freedom from the British rule, he was often in danger of reprisals from the Colonial government. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1955.

==Life==
Born in Varanasi, India, he graduated school to become a deputy in the collections bureau, and later left to continue his academic pursuits. Das joined the Theosophical Society in 1894 inspired by a speech by Annie Besant. After the 1895 split, he sided with the Theosophical Society Adyar. Within that society, he was an opponent of Jiddu Krishnamurti and his Order of the Star in the East organisation. Das joined the Indian National Congress during the Non-co-operation movement and was honoured with the Bharat Ratna in 1955.

With Besant he formed a professional collaboration which led to the founding of the Central Hindu College, which became Central Hindu School. Das would later found the Kashi Vidya Peeth, a national university where he served as headmaster. Das was a scholar of Sanskrit, from which he added to the body of Hindi language. He wrote approximately 30 books, many of these in Sanskrit and Hindi.

A prominent road in New Delhi, on which the Supreme Court of India is situated, is named after him and a colony is also named after his name in Sigra area of Varanasi &#x27;Dr. Bhagwan Das Nagar.&#x27;

In Banaras Hindu University, Law hostel is named after him (Dr.Bhagwan Das Hostel). The Indian Law Institute and office of the Bar Council of India is located on the road named after Dr. Bhagwan Das near Pragati Maidan in New Delhi.

== The Pranava-Vada of Gargyayana ==

The Pranava-Vada of Gargyayana (&quot;pranava-vāda&quot; is the Sanskrit for &quot;uttering of Pranava (AUM)&quot;) was published in three volumes in years 1910-1913 by the Theosophical Society, Adyar with notes by Annie Besant. Das alleges that the work is a &quot;summarised translation&quot; of an otherwise unknown &quot;ancient text&quot; by a sage called Gargyayana. Das states that the text was dictated to him from memory by &quot;Pandit Dhanaraja Mishra&quot;, a theosophist friend of his who was blind in both eyes and had died before the book&#x27;s publication.

This book has nothing to do with the original Pranava Veda by Mamuni Mayan

<text>Elena Davidovna Kats-Chernin (born 4 November 1957) is an Uzbek-born Australian composer and pianist, best known for her ballet &quot;Wild Swans&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Elena Kats-Chernin was born in Tashkent (now the capital of independent Uzbekistan, but then part of the Soviet Union) and is Jewish. She studied at the Yaroslavl Music School and the Gnessin State Musical College in Moscow from age 14, and migrated to Australia in 1975, continuing her studies at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, under Richard Toop (composition) and Gordon Watson (piano). She also participated in the Darlinghurst underground theatre scene, with groups such as Cabaret Conspiracy, Fifi Lamour, Boom Boom La Burn and others, often under the name Elena Kats.

==Europe==
Kats-Chernin studied with Helmut Lachenmann in Germany. She remained in Europe for thirteen years, and became active in theatre and ballet, composing for state theatres in Berlin, Vienna, Hamburg and Bochum. In 1993 she wrote &quot;Clocks&quot; for the Ensemble Modern. It has since been performed around the world.

==Australia==
Since returning to Australia in 1994, Kats-Chernin has written several operas, two piano concertos and compositions for many performers and ensembles, including The Seymour Group, The Song Company, The Sydney Jewish Choral Society, the Sydney Alpha Ensemble, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Bang on a Can All-Stars, Chamber Made Opera, the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. She was commissioned to write a piece, &quot;Page Turn&quot;, for the 2000 Sydney International Piano Competition. Her music was featured at the opening ceremonies of both the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

She wrote three silent film soundtracks for a co-production between German/French TV channels ZDF/ARTE: Victor Sjöström&#x27;s &#x27; (&quot;The Phantom Carriage&quot;, 1921), Billy Wilder and Robert Siodmak&#x27;s &quot;People on Sunday&quot; (&#x27;, 1930), and G. W. Pabst&#x27;s &quot;The Devious Path&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1928). Kats-Chernin&#x27;s other works include &quot;Charleston Noir&quot; for solo piano, &quot;Rockhampton Garden Symphonies&quot; with Mark Svendsen for solo voices, mixed choirs and orchestra, and &quot;Wild Swans&quot;, a collaboration with choreographer Meryl Tankard.

She has won numerous music composition prizes in Australia, and her pieces are regularly broadcast on ABC Classic FM radio. In 2009, Kats-Chernin was commissioned by the National Museum of Australia to write a piece for orchestra called &quot;Garden of Dreams&quot;, named for one of the architectural features of the museum, which premiered at the museum the same year.

Performances of Kats-Chernin&#x27;s music are available on several commercially released recordings. One album is &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot;, released in August 2006 by Tall Poppies Records. &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot; includes &quot;Charleston Noir&quot;, for four basses; &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot;, for harp (1995), played by Alice Giles; &quot;Still Life&quot;, for viola and piano (2001); &quot;Gypsy Ramble&quot;, for viola, cello and piano (1996); &quot;Wild Rice&quot;, for cello (1996); and &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot;, for horn, violin and piano (1999).

Kats-Chernin&#x27;s &quot;Eliza Aria&quot; from her score for the ballet &quot;Wild Swans&quot; (ABC Classics) is used in Lloyds TSB&#x27;s 2007 television advertisements. In 2010, &quot;Wild Swans&quot; became the theme music for ABC Radio National&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Live&quot; program until the end of 2015.

Kats-Chernin has written a number of ragtime pieces for piano; one of these, &quot;Russian Rag&quot;, was used in two different instrumental ensemble arrangements, as the theme of &quot;Late Night Live&quot; until 2010. It is also used as the New York theme in Adam Elliot&#x27;s feature film, &quot;Mary and Max&quot;.

Kats-Chernin is a represented composer of the Australian Music Centre.

A portrait of Kats-Chernin by Australian portrait artist Wendy Sharpe was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery (Australia) in 2019.

<text>The Cumberland Presbyterian Church is a Presbyterian denomination spawned by the Second Great Awakening. In 2019, it had 65,087 members and 673 congregations, of which 51 were located outside of the United States. The word &quot;Cumberland&quot; comes from the Cumberland River valley where the church was founded.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The divisions which led to the formation of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church can be traced back to the First Great Awakening. At that time, Presbyterians in North America split between the &quot;Old Side&quot; (mainly congregations of Scottish and Scotch-Irish extraction) who favored a doctrinally oriented church with a highly educated ministry and a &quot;New Side&quot; (mainly of English extraction) who put greater emphasis on the experiential techniques championed by the Great Awakening. The formal split between Old Side and New Side lasted only from 1741 to 1758, but the two orientations remained present in the reunified church and would come to the fore again during the Second Great Awakening.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Presbyterians on the frontier suffered from a shortage of educated clergy willing to move to the frontier beyond the Appalachian Mountains. At the same time, Methodists and Baptists were sending preachers with little or no formal training into frontier regions and were very successful in organizing Methodist and Baptist congregations. Drawing on New Side precedents, Cumberland Presbytery in Kentucky began ordaining men without the educational background required by the Kentucky Synod. This was bad enough for supporters of the Old Side, but what was even worse was that the presbytery allowed ministers to offer a qualified assent to the Westminster Confession, only requiring them to swear assent to the Confession &quot;so far as they deemed it agreeable to the Word of God&quot;. Old Siders in the Kentucky Synod (which had oversight over Cumberland Presbytery) sought to discipline the presbytery. Presbytery and synod were involved in a protracted dispute which touched upon the nature of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Ultimately, the synod decided to dissolve Cumberland Presbytery and expel a number of its ministers.

The Cumberland Presbyterian denomination was made up of the expelled members of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) and others in the area when the Kentucky Synod dissolved the original Cumberland Presbytery. There is historical evidence in the writings of several of the founders that indicate they did not intend the split to be permanent and certainly did not anticipate a long-standing separate denomination.

On February 4, 1810, near what later became Burns, Tennessee, in the log cabin home of the Rev. Samuel McAdow, he, the Rev. Finis Ewing and the Rev. Samuel King reorganized Cumberland Presbytery. After rapid growth, Cumberland Presbytery became Cumberland Synod in 1813 and the Cumberland Presbyterian denomination in 1829 when the General Assembly of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was established.

A replica of the Rev. Samuel McAdow&#x27;s cabin now stands where the three founded the church, and a sandstone chapel commemorating the event has been erected nearby. These two buildings are two of the main attractions in the surrounding Montgomery Bell State Park. An outgrowth of the Great Revival of 1800, also called the Second Great Awakening, the new denomination arose to minister to the spiritual needs of a pioneer people who turned from the doctrine of predestination as they interpreted it to embrace the so-called &quot;Whosoever Will&quot; gospel of the new church. The Red River Meeting House in Logan County, Kentucky, marks the location of the revival meeting thought by some to have given rise to the first organized Cumberland Presbyterian congregation.

=== Subsequent history ===
In 1826, Cumberland Presbyterians established Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, in order to better train their candidates for the ministry. Although very much a frontier institution, under the presidency of Franceway Ranna Cossitt, Cumberland College was one of the first colleges in the United States to accept women as students. Ann Harpending and Melinda Barnett, for example, enrolled in the very first class.

The Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, a primarily African-American denomination, split from the primarily white Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1874. Relations between the two groups have for the most part been very cordial, and many of the CPCA ministers have trained at Memphis Theological Seminary. A reunion attempt on the part of both denominations failed to win approval in the late 1980s. The African American church wanted equal representation on all boards and agencies, feeling that otherwise they would be swallowed up by the larger white church. The joint committee drafting the plan of union agreed and made such a stipulation in its reporting to the General Assembly. However, many in the white, rural, southern-based church were not willing to cede that much power and balked at the plan. No other plans for union have been attempted. However, the two denominations share a confession of faith and cooperate in many common ministries.

In 1889, Cumberland Presbyterians were the first body in the Presbyterian or Reformed traditions to ordain a woman as a minister, Louisa Mariah Layman Woosley. A relatively conservative body, Nolin Presbytery, ordained Woosley while a relatively liberal body, Kentucky Synod, opposed her ordination and instructed the presbytery to remove her from the ministerial roll.

====Upper Cumberland Presbyterian Church====
The Upper Cumberland Presbyterian Church is a small denomination which broke off from the Cumberland Presbyterian church over issues of membership in the National Council of Churches and the use of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible; it has fewer than 1,000 members among twelve congregations in Alabama and Tennessee. The Upper Cumberland Presbyterian Church uses a slightly revised version of the 1883 Confession of Faith of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC); the main body of the CPC adopted a new Confession Of Faith in 1984. The seeds of the Upper Cumberland Presbyterian Church arose from a group known as the Fellowship of Cumberland Presbyterian Conservatives. Members of this group protested modernizing trends within that denomination, in particular the widespread usage of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible. The Fellowship of Cumberland Presbyterian Conservatives formed a conference and planned a second one in Memphis, Tennessee. When the CP General Assembly declared its actions to be unconstitutional, several leaders of the group left the CPC and formed the new Upper Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The &quot;Upper Cumberland&quot; part of the name refers to the fact that the denomination was established in Gallatin, Tennessee, on the Upper Cumberland River, the section of the Cumberland River east of Nashville, Tennessee. The King James Version is the official Bible of the denomination.

The Upper Cumberland Presbyterian congregations are mostly rural, country churches. They are located in three geographic areas: East of Nashville, South of Nashville and North Central Alabama. The representatives of the twelve congregations meet twice a year to form a presbytery. This is the highest church court of the denomination. There are no synods or general assemblies as in other Presbyterian bodies. A moderator of presbytery is elected for a six-month term. The denomination&#x27;s official publication is called &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. The denomination does not have a college or seminary. Ministers are usually self-taught men who are then further trained by the Ministerial Training Committee. Some prominent ministers of the denomination have held other careers while serving as pastors.

=== Reunion ===
By 1900, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was the third largest Presbyterian or Reformed body in the United States and was rapidly growing. After making revisions to the Westminster Confession in 1903, the PCUSA (the so-called &quot;Northern&quot; denomination) proposed reunification with the CPC. The General Assembly voted by a significant majority for the union in the 1906 meeting. As a result, a large number of Cumberland congregations re-entered the PCUSA in 1906 and those who remained in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church felt somewhat antagonistic towards the PCUSA for generations afterward. About 1,000 pastors and 90,000 former Cumberland Presbyterian Church members joined the Northern Presbyterian Church, but about 50,000 stayed out and continued on as Cumberland Presbyterian Church.

=== Recent history ===

The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America held concurrent 2006 general assemblies in Birmingham, Alabama in celebration of 300 years of Presbyterianism in North America. The confessional differences between the denominations that resulted in the CPC&#x27;s split have largely disappeared. However, new differences have arisen such as the stances on homosexuality and views toward the scriptures. The CPC, for the most part, holds to more conservative beliefs than the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), with an orientation toward Arminianism as opposed to the strict Calvinism of other conservative Presbyterian churches in the U.S.

== Beliefs and practices ==
Cumberland Presbyterians were among the first denominations to admit women to their educational institutions and to accept them in leadership roles. They were the first to include women as ordained clergy. Cumberland Presbyterians were also early to ordain African-Americans to the ministry. The 1984 revision of the Cumberland Presbyterian Confession of Faith, reflecting the denomination&#x27;s long-standing traditions, was one of the first inclusive confessional documents in the Reformed tradition. This Confession was revised by a broad composite of theologians of both Cumberland Presbyterian Churches.

However, for the most part, the CPC&#x27;s constituency and theology resembles that of the United Methodist Church, appealing mainly to long-established families with revivalistic religious tastes and generally conservative cultural dispositions, derived chiefly from the agricultural orientation of most of its historic territory, the Upper South. Although explicit fundamentalism and liberalism are rare in the CPC, neither is entirely absent, and recent trends in the denomination seem to be moving it further towards traditionalism. As the denomination has become more conservative, some of its liberal ministers and members have transferred membership to the Presbyterian Church (USA), thereby intensifying already-present theological and social tendencies in the remaining CPC faithful toward evangelicalism.

== Structure ==
As with any church holding to a Presbyterian polity, individual congregations are represented by elders (who form a session to govern the local church) at presbyteries. Presbyteries, in turn, send delegates to synods. Finally, the entire structure is governed by the General Assembly. The Assembly charges various boards and agencies with the day-to-day operation of the denomination.

Cumberland Presbyterian congregations may be found throughout the U.S. as well as in several foreign countries (Japan, Hong Kong, Colombia, etc.) but are primarily located in the American South and border states, with strong concentrations in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Missouri, southern Illinois, Arkansas, and Texas. Many of those congregations are located outside major metropolitan areas, in small towns and rural communities. The majority of those churches founded in towns and cities in the 19th century joined in the union with the PCUSA in 1906 after the General Assembly voted to unite with that body. However, so did a fair number of the country churches, who were likely served at the time by pastors with relatively greater theological training, which would have been required by the mainstream Presbyterian tradition for admission to the ministry.

=== Presbyteries ===
==== Cumberland Presbytery, Cumberland Presbyterian Church, 1810–1813 ====
The genesis of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was the reformed Cumberland Presbytery organized on February 4, 1810. The presbytery was made up of members of the Presbyterian Church and others in the area left abandoned when Kentucky Synod PCUSA dissolved the original Cumberland Presbytery and expelled many of its ministers. The new independent presbytery struggled to be reunited with the larger Presbyterian Church. At the same time, it grew rapidly and divided into three smaller presbyteries in 1813. Cumberland Presbytery was succeeded by Cumberland Synod.

==== Cumberland Presbytery, Cumberland Presbyterian Church, 1845–1988 ====
King Presbytery of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church met only three times in 1843 and 1844 before being renamed Cumberland Presbytery by Green River Synod in 1844. Located primarily in South-Central and Eastern Kentucky, this Cumberland Presbytery was a member judicatory of Green River Synod from 1844 to 1888 and of Kentucky Synod from 1888 to 1988. This Cumberland Presbytery was one of the best organized and funded of all Cumberland Presbyterian judicatories. After the partial reunion of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in 1906, it was the financial stability of Cumberland Presbytery that enabled the Cumberland Presbyterian Denomination to survive. In 1988, as part of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church middle judicatory realignment, this Cumberland Presbytery was dissolved only to be reformed as a much larger presbytery. The last stated clerk was Rev. James W. Knight.

==== Cumberland Presbytery, Cumberland Presbyterian Church, 1988–present ====
Primarily located in central and eastern Kentucky with one congregation in Pennsylvania, Cumberland Presbytery forms the traditional heart of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. This incarnation of the presbytery was formed in the Cumberland Presbyterian middle judicatory realignment of 1988. Cumberland Presbytery is a part of Midwest Synod of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.

==== Kentucky Synod, Cumberland Presbyterian Church, 1845–1865 ====
Formed from Green River Synod in 1845 and dissolved back into Green River Synod in 1865. This Kentucky Synod&#x27;s history is largely unknown. It was dissolved for repeatedly failing to meet.

==== Kentucky Synod, Cumberland Presbyterian Church 1888–1988 ====
In 1888, the name of Green River Synod was changed to Kentucky Synod. In 1988, Kentucky Synod merged with North Central Synod to form the Synod of the Midwest. Kentucky Synod was, perhaps, the best funded and organized of all Cumberland Presbyterian synods. Few other judicatories exercised synodic authority to the same degree. The synod maintained a &quot;Center&quot; in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and employed an executive and staff. The last Executive Presbyter was Rev. James W. Knight.

== Demographics ==
The Cumberland Presbyterian Church is present in 23 US states, mainly in the South. Tennessee has far the highest adherents rate 4.64 /1,000 people, about 30,000 members, followed by Kentucky with 10,000 members. Arkansas and Alabama has a large followers of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church represents both 1.23/1,000 adherents rate, with about 6,000 members in 59 churches in Alabama, and 3,600 members in 61 congregations in Arkansas. In the South churches are in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida. The denomination is present also in Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Arizona and California.

The church has Korean language speaking Presbyteries.

== Schools and institutions ==
Prior to the 1906 partial union, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church placed a great deal of emphasis on education and sponsored 22 colleges and universities. All but one united with the Presbyterian Church. The denomination now maintains a single four-year liberal arts college, Bethel University, formerly Bethel College, located in McKenzie, Tennessee. Recently, the denomination has related to this institution through a covenant agreement, forgoing direct ownership and control. The denomination also operates a seminary, Memphis Theological Seminary, in Memphis, Tennessee. The Cumberland Presbyterian Center, also located in Memphis, houses other church boards and agencies. The denomination maintains a Children&#x27;s Home in Denton, Texas. The Historical Foundation of the CPC and the CPCA maintains its library and archives at the Cumberland Presbyterian Center in Memphis.

In recent years, the denomination adopted an alternate educational route to ordination of ministers, known as the Program of Alternate Studies. PAS, as it became known, was intended to serve persons embarking on a second vocation but not as an alternate a seminary education. However, a larger and larger percentage of candidates for the ministry are being allowed by their presbyteries to choose this non-seminary route to ordination, prompting a debate over what many in the church regard as a lessening of educational standards. At the present rate, the number of Cumberland Presbyterian clergy ordained without a seminary degree will surpass seminary-trained clergy within a few years.

<text>Anna Kay Faris ( ; born November 29, 1976) is an American actress and podcaster. Known for playing comedic roles, she rose to prominence with the lead part of Cindy Campbell in the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; film series (2000–2006). Her film credits include &quot;The Hot Chick&quot; (2002), &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003), &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), &quot;Just Friends&quot; (2005), &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot; (2006), &quot;Smiley Face&quot; (2007), &quot;The House Bunny&quot; (2008), &quot;What&#x27;s Your Number?&quot; (2011), &quot;The Dictator&quot; (2012), and &quot;Overboard&quot; (2018).

Faris has had voice-over roles in the film series &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot; (2009–2013) and &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; (2009–2015), and in &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot; (2017). On television, she had a recurring role as Erica in the final season of the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (2004) and starred as Christy Plunkett in the CBS sitcom &quot;Mom&quot; (2013–2020).

In 2015, Faris launched &quot;Unqualified&quot;, an advice podcast, and in 2017, her memoir of the same name was published, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller.

==Early life==
Faris was born on November 29, 1976, in Baltimore, Maryland, the second child of Jack, a sociology professor, and Karen Faris, a special education teacher. Both her parents, natives of Seattle, Washington, were living in Baltimore as her father had accepted a professorship at Towson University. When Faris was six, the family moved to Edmonds, Washington. Her father worked at the University of Washington as a vice president of internal communications, and later headed the Washington Biotechnology and Biomedical Association, while her mother taught at Seaview Elementary School in Edmonds.

Faris has an older brother, Robert, who is also a sociologist and professor at the University of California, Davis. In interviews, she has described her parents as &quot;ultra liberal&quot; and said that she and her brother were raised in an irreligious but &quot;very conservative&quot;, traditional atmosphere. At age six, her parents enrolled her in a community drama class for children, as they usually encouraged her to act. She enjoyed watching plays and eventually produced her own material in her bedroom with neighborhood friends. She has said in interviews she often imagined her orthodontal retainer talking to her, and that she pictured herself &quot;on talk shows to talk about [her] talking retainer&quot;.

Faris attended Edmonds Woodway High School. While studying, performed onstage with a Seattle repertory company and in nationally broadcast radio plays. She once described herself as &quot;a drama-club dork,&quot; and said she used to wear a Christmas-tree skirt in school. She graduated in 1994). She attended the University of Washington, where she earned a degree in English literature in 1999. Despite her love of acting, she admitted she &quot;never really thought [she] wanted to become a movie star&quot; and continued to act &quot;just to make some extra money,&quot; hoping one day to publish a novel. After graduating from college, she was going to travel to London, where she had a receptionist job lined up at an ad agency. However, she ended up living in Los Angeles &quot;at the last minute,&quot; once she committed to the idea of pursuing acting. Shortly afterwards, she obtained the starring role in &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. At 22, she lived in a studio apartment at The Ravenswood in Hancock Park.

==Career==
===Early acting credits (1986–1999)===
Encouraged by her parents to pursue acting when she was young, Faris gave her first professional performance at age nine in a three-month run of Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;Danger: Memory!&quot; at the Seattle Repertory Theater. She made US$250 for the role, which was &quot;huge&quot; for her at the time. &quot;I felt like I was rolling in the dough,&quot; she recalled. She went on to play Scout in a production of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; at the Village Theatre in Issaquah, Washington, the title character in &quot;Heidi&quot;, and Rebecca in &quot;Our Town&quot;. Her theater credits during that period included productions of &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Some Fish&quot;, &quot;No Elephants&quot;, and &quot;Life Under Water&quot;.

While in high school, Faris appeared in a television commercial for a frozen yogurt brand and in a training video for Red Robin. On the latter, she said in May 2012: &quot;I play, like, the perfect hostess. And I think they still use it.&quot;

Faris played brief roles in the made-for-TV film &quot;Deception: A Mother&#x27;s Secret&quot; and the independent drama &quot;Eden&quot;, the latter of which screened at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival. Her first major film role came shortly after college, in the independent slasher film &quot;Lovers Lane&quot; (1999), in which she played an ill-fated cheerleader. A B-movie, it received a straight-to-DVD release. Critical reception was mixed, but for her part, Faris garnered her first acting reviews by writers; &quot;efilmcritic.com&quot; Greg Muskewitz found her the film&#x27;s &quot;one center of interest&quot;.

===Breakthrough with &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000–2006)===
Faris&#x27;s breakout role came in 2000 when she starred in the horror-comedy parody film &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, portraying Cindy Campbell, a play on the character of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in the slasher thriller &quot;Scream&quot;. It marked her first starring credit, as she had appeared only in small and supporting parts in theater plays and low-budget features. She found the experience a &quot;great boot camp&quot; for her, as she told UK&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2009, explaining that she &quot;hadn&#x27;t done much before that. With those movies, you have to be so exact with your props and the physical comedy and everything, so it was a great training ground.&quot; &quot;Scary Movie&quot; was a major commercial success, ranking atop the box office charts with a US$42 million opening weekend gross. It went on to earn US$278 million worldwide. For her performance, Faris received nominations for the Breakthrough Female Performance and Best Kiss Awards at the 2001 MTV Movie Awards. She subsequently reprised her role in &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;, released on July 4, 2001.

Her next film role was that of the lesbian colleague of a lonely and traumatized young woman in the independent psychological thriller &quot;May&quot; (2002), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was released in selected theaters. In its review, &quot;The Digital Fix&quot; found it &quot;one of the finest examples of independent American genre filmmaking&quot; and asserted that Faris played her role &quot;with an infectious level of enthusiasm, frequently skirting the border between a believable performance and one that is completely over the top, but always managing to come down on the right side.&quot; Later in 2002, she starred alongside Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams in the comedy &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;, about a teenage girl whose mind is magically swapped with that of a 30-year-old criminal. It was a modest commercial success, grossing US$54 million worldwide.

In 2003, Faris was &quot;cast last-minute&quot; opposite Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s drama &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, where she played a &quot;bubbly, extroverted&quot; actress getting in with an aging actor in Tokyo. She felt the film gave her the chance to get people to know her body of work a &quot;little more,&quot; and called it &quot;the best experience of [her] life&quot; at the time. While &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that Faris &quot;contributes an amusing turn&quot; as her &quot;vacuous movie star&quot; character, &quot;New York Times&quot; concluded that the actress, &quot;who barely registers in the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; pictures—and she&#x27;s the star—comes to full, lovable and irritating life as a live-wire starlet [...] this movie will secure her a career.&quot; Budgeted at US$4 million, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; grossed US$119.7 million globally. She portrayed Cindy Campbell for the third time in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot;.

In 2004, Faris debuted on the last season of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; in the recurring role of Erica, the mother whose twin babies are adopted by Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica (Courteney Cox); and in the summer that year, she filmed a small part in Ang Lee&#x27;s drama &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005). As her character had just &quot;one scene in the movie,&quot; she only spent two days on set in Calgary. For the film, Faris, along with her co-stars, received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

Faris starred in the 2005 comedies &quot;Waiting...&quot; and &quot;Just Friends&quot;, both alongside Ryan Reynolds. &quot;Waiting...&quot; was an independent production about restaurant employees who collectively stave off boredom and adulthood with their antics. Budgeted at US$3 million, it made US$18.6 million, but a &quot;View London&quot; reviewer, remarking that the director had &quot;assembled a decent comic cast,&quot; felt that &quot;he gives them practically nothing to do. Reynolds and [...] Faris were hilarious together in &quot;Just Friends&quot;, so it&#x27;s a shame that their talents are so wasted here.&quot; In &quot;Just Friends&quot;, Faris portrayed Samantha James, an emerging, self-obsessed pop singer landing in New Jersey with a formerly overweight nerd (played by co-star Reynolds), now a successful record producer. It grossed US$50.9 million around the globe, and earned Faris nominations for an MTV Movie Award and two Teen Choice Awards.

Faris played Cindy Campbell for the fourth and final time in &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot;, which premiered on April 14, 2006. In 2006, she also appeared opposite Uma Thurman and Luke Wilson in Ivan Reitman&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, playing Hannah, the co-worker of a man (Wilson) dating a neurotic and aggressive superhero (Thurman). While critical response was mixed, it made US$61 million worldwide, and Faris and Thurman both got MTV Movie Award nominations for Best Fight.

===Continued comedic roles (2007–2012)===

In Gregg Araki&#x27;s independent stoner comedy &quot;Smiley Face&quot; (2007), Faris starred as Jane F, a young woman who has a series of misadventures after eating a large number of cupcakes laced with cannabis. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and received a limited theatrical release in Los Angeles. Reviews were largely positive; according to the film-critics aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, writers agreed that her &quot;bright performance and Gregg Araki&#x27;s sharp direction&quot; made the film &quot;more than [the] average stoner comedy.&quot; It earned her the &quot;Stonette of the Year&quot; prize at &quot;High Times&quot; magazine&#x27;s Stony Awards.

She appeared opposite Diane Keaton and Jon Heder in the independent comedy &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot;, playing an aspiring singer and the love interest of a self-absorbed 29-year-old (Heder). Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot; premiered on November 30, 2007, to lukewarm critical and commercial responses. She followed it with a starring part in a mainstream feature, Fred Wolf&#x27;s comedy &quot;The House Bunny&quot;, where she appeared as Shelley, a former Playboy bunny who signs up to be the &quot;house mother&quot; of an unpopular university sorority after being expelled from the Playboy Mansion. Although it received average reviews, critics were unanimously favorable towards Faris&#x27;s part, most of them agreeing, according to website Rotten Tomatoes, that she was &quot;game&quot; in what they called a &quot;middling, formulaic comedy.&quot; The film was released on August 22, 2008, in the US, and made US$70 million in its global theatrical run.

Faris&#x27;s first movie of 2009 was the British science fiction-comedy &quot;Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel&quot;, which follows two social outcasts and their cynical friend as they attempt to navigate a time-travel conundrum in the middle of a British pub. Faris played Cassie, a girl from the future who sets the adventure in motion. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her appearance as a &quot;bewildered cameo&quot;. It received a theatrical release only in the UK, and later had several television premiere airings across Europe. 

In the black comedy &quot;Observe and Report&quot; (2009), Faris co-starred opposite Seth Rogen, portraying a vulgar, hard-partying cosmetic counter employee on whom Rogen has a crush. She was drawn to appear in the movie, as it gave Faris the opportunity to play an &quot;awful character&quot; rather than the usual &quot;roles where you have to win the audience over or win the guy over, and be charming.&quot; Controversy arose regarding a scene where Rogen has sex with Faris&#x27;s intoxicated character, with various advocacy groups commenting that it constituted date rape. Budgeted at US$18 million, &quot;Observe and Report&quot; made US$26 million. Faris voiced a weather intern and the love interest of a wannabe scientist in the animated &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot; as well as Jeanette Miller (one of the Chipettes) in the live-action hybrid &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot;, both of which were box office successes.

Faris starred in the animated live-action film &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; as a nature documentary filmmaker befriending the titular character. It was released by Warner Bros. on December 17, 2010, receiving largely negative reviews, with many critics unimpressed by its screenplay. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, while admitting to find her &quot;very talented&quot; in its verdict, wondered &quot;what on earth&quot; made her agree to play her role. The film, however, made US$201 million worldwide.

Faris&#x27;s subsequent film release was the retro comedy &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, about a group of friends partying on one summer night during the 1980s. Filmed in 2007, it received a wide theatrical release four years later, on March 4, 2011, to negative reviews and lackluster earnings. Faris, however, obtained a Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy. She next had the starring part and served as executive producer of &quot;What&#x27;s Your Number?&quot;, where she appeared with Chris Evans. In the movie, she played a woman who looks back at the past 19 men she has had relationships with and wonders if one of them might be her one true love. It garnered generally mediocre reviews, who concluded that the &quot;comic timing&quot; of Faris was &quot;sharp as always,&quot; but felt it was wasted in &quot;this predictable, boilerplate comedy.&quot; It was released on September 30, 2011, and made US$30 million worldwide. She also reprised her voice-over role in &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked&quot;, released on December 16, 2011.

Her next film role was that of a human rights activist befriending a childish autocrat in the political satire &quot;The Dictator&quot; (2012), co-starring Sacha Baron Cohen. Faris, who was eager to work with Baron Cohen as she had been his fan &quot;for years,&quot; stated that &quot;90 percent&quot; of the acting in the film was improvised. Critics gave it decent reviews, with Faris&#x27;s role garnering a similar reception; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her &quot;the film&#x27;s standout&quot; and stated that when &quot;she opens her mouth, that rasp that has made her so much fun to watch (the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; franchise most memorably) takes hold and turns the dialogue inside out. The kind of true-believer purity she brings to Zoey&#x27;s eco-terrorizing rants comes close to stealing Baron Cohen&#x27;s comic thunder.&quot; The picture was a box office success, grossing US$179 million globally, and earned Faris the Star of the Year Award at the National Association of Theatre Owners.

===&quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Unqualified&quot; (2013–present)===

In 2013, Faris acted for the third time with then-husband Chris Pratt, following &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Your Number?&quot; in a segment of &quot;Movie 43&quot;, an independent anthology black comedy that featured 14 different storylines, with each segment having a different director. The film was universally panned by critics, with the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; calling it &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of awful.&quot; In the British romantic comedy &quot;I Give It a Year&quot; (2013), Faris played an old flame of a writer (Rafe Spall) who hastily tied the knot. Released shortly after &quot;Movie 43&quot;, the film received mixed reviews and was a commercial success in the UK.

Faris obtained the main role of the CBS sitcom series &quot;Mom&quot;, which debuted on September 23, 2013. Her character is Christy, a newly sober single mom who tries to pull her life together in Napa Valley. As she landed the part, the show gave Faris, who had guest-starred in various television programs until then, her first full-time television role. Throughout its eight-season run, the sitcom has become the third most-watched comedy on television, and has received generally favorable reviews; &quot;Vulture&quot; called her &quot;the most talented comic actress of her generation,&quot; and &quot;Boston Herald&quot; critic, Mark A. Perigard wrote in his verdict: &quot;This is dark material, yet Faris balances it with a genuine winsomeness, able to wring laughs out of the most innocuous lines.&quot; She has been nominated for one Prism Award and two People&#x27;s Choice Awards. In 2020, Faris left the show after seven seasons.

Faris reprised her voice-role in the animated science-fiction comedy sequel &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2&quot;, released in theaters four days after &quot;Mom&quot; premiered on television. Like the first film, &quot;Meatballs 2&quot; was a commercial success, grossing US$274.3 million worldwide. The following year, she had an uncredited cameo in the closing-credits sequence of the action-comedy &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;, appearing in a segment called &quot;30 Jump Street: Flight Academy&quot;.

Faris and &quot;Mom&quot; co-star Allison Janney hosted the 41st People&#x27;s Choice Awards, which were held January 7, 2015. In November, she launched &quot;Unqualified&quot;, a free-form advice podcast; along with producer Sim Sarna, she is the host of the show, which consists of interviews with celebrities and cultural figures, followed by personal phone-calls to listeners asking for relationship and other advice. Faris was inspired to create the podcast after listening to &quot;Serial&quot;, and explaining the evolution of the idea, she said: &quot;I love to talk about relationships; that&#x27;s all I want to talk about with my friends. And then I just thought, I kind of want a hobby [...] So I started asking around to some friends, and I asked this technical producer guy what equipment I should buy on Amazon. And I just started recording my friends when they would come over. And then with my dear friend Sim, we started flushing out the whole thing, which clearly there&#x27;s still a lot more flushing out to do. It started out as a dinky hobby.&quot; As of May 2021, 249 episodes have been released.

Faris reprised her voice-over role in &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip in 2015&quot;, the fourth installment in the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; film series. In 2016, she had a brief appearance as an exaggerated version of herself in the action-comedy &quot;Keanu&quot;, and starred in the music video for the song &quot;Hold on to Me&quot; by Mondo Cozmo. She is also a musician, and knows how to play percussion instruments. An example of this was when she played a Brazilian instrument called Timbau on the program &quot;Build&quot;, and since then she has stood out as an actress and musician. Faris voiced one of the lead characters, Jailbreak, in the animated comedy &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot; (originally set to be voiced by Ilana Glazer), which was universally panned by critics.

Faris published her first book, &quot;Unqualified&quot;, in October 2017. The memoir became one of the &quot;top 20 blockbuster books of autumn,&quot; according to Amazon, and received a positive critical response; &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the book to be &quot;goofily self-deprecating, casually profane and occasionally raw, earnest and blunt, like Ms. Faris herself,&quot; and &quot;The Ringer&quot; remarked: &quot;&quot;Unqualified&quot; is observant, sharp, and startlingly revealing, not only about Faris&#x27;s romantic history, but of the broader discrepancies between modern male and female Hollywood stardom writ large.&quot;

In &quot;Overboard&quot; (2018), a remake of the 1987 film of the same name starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Faris played a single, working-class mother who convinces a spoiled wealthy playboy (Eugenio Derbez) with amnesia that they are married. While publications such as IndieWire and &quot;Film Inquiry&quot; praised the chemistry between Derbez and Faris, most critics felt that the film made &quot;poor use of the ever-charming&quot; Faris. Her first leading film role since 2011&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Your Number&quot;, &quot;Overboard&quot; was a commercial success, grossing over US$91.2 million worldwide.

==Media image==

During her career, Faris has been called one of the &quot;most talented comedic actresses&quot; of her generation by several publications. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine named her &quot;the &quot;Cosmo&quot;″s Fun Fearless Female of the Year&quot; in 2010, and Tad Friend described her in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s most original comedic actress.&quot; A &quot;Vulture&quot; article called Faris &quot;her generation&#x27;s Goldie Hawn&quot; and she has been often compared to comedian Lucille Ball. &quot;The Wrap&quot;, likening her to Ball, asserted the actress &quot;has impeccable timing and isn&#x27;t afraid to cast dignity aside in pursuit of a hearty laugh,&quot; while NPR described her as &quot;Hawn&#x27;s heir apparent—a modern-day Lucille Ball with an up-for-anything mania and a gift for the low arts of slapstick and pulling faces.&quot;

Although some of her movies have been critically panned or flopped at the box office, Faris remains often acclaimed for her portrayals in most of them. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; once stated it was a &quot;pleasure to watch&quot; Faris on screen and described her as &quot;a gifted, likeable comedian who tends to be the best element of many terrible movies.&quot; &quot;Slate&quot; magazine&#x27;s Dana Stevens wrote in her review for Faris&#x27;s vehicle &quot;What&#x27;s Your Number?&quot;: &quot;More than any contemporary comedienne I can think of [...] Faris demonstrates this fearless anything-for-a-laugh quality. It would be wonderful to see her in a movie that tested the limits of that audacity, rather than forcing her to tamp it down.&quot; Most critics agree that her 2007 independent comedy &quot;Smiley Face&quot; remains one of her best films; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that this film was &quot;an opportunity for the actress to show that she can carry a movie composed of often hilarious nonstop misadventures. No matter how outrageously or foolishly Faris&#x27; Jane behaves, she remains blissfully appealing—such are Faris&#x27; fearless comedic skills and the freshness of her radiant blond beauty.&quot;

Faris has appeared on the covers and photo sessions of several magazines throughout her career; she graced the September 2000 cover of &quot;Raygun&quot;, and in subsequent years the list has included &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Self&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot;, &quot;Paper&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, among others. She was featured in &quot;GQ UK&quot; June 2001 pictorial of &quot;Young Hollywood.&quot; She has been listed as No. 57, No. 39, No. 42 and No. 44 in &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Hot 100&quot; in 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively. In 2009, she was ranked No. 60 in &quot;FHM&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World,&quot; and ranked No. 96 on the same list in 2010. &quot;Ask Men&quot; also featured her as No. 78 on its 2009 &quot;100 Most Desirable Women in the World&quot; list.

==Personal life==

Faris started dating actor Ben Indra shortly after they met on the set of the 1999 indie slasher film &quot;Lovers Lane&quot;. They married in June 2004. Faris filed for divorce in April 2007 citing irreconcilable differences. As part of their divorce agreement in February 2008, she agreed to pay Indra $900,000 in addition to other property and acting royalties.

During her divorce from Indra and after filming &quot;The House Bunny&quot;, Faris got breast implants, which she first revealed in an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in April 2011. She said it &quot;wasn&#x27;t a career thing—it was a divorce thing&quot;, and recalled in her memoir &quot;Unqualified&quot; that she had previously been insecure about her breasts.

Faris met actor Chris Pratt in early 2007 at the table read in Los Angeles for the film &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot; where their characters were love interests. They started dating shortly after, became engaged in late 2008, and married on July 9, 2009, in a small ceremony in Bali, Indonesia, eloping on a whim after a friend&#x27;s wedding. They have a son, Jack, who was born on August 25, 2012, nine weeks premature and spent a month in intensive care before going home. The family lived in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. On August 6, 2017, the couple announced their separation, and filed for divorce on December 1, 2017. On October 16, 2018, it was announced that it had been finalized.

In September 2017, Faris reportedly began dating cinematographer Michael Barrett, whom she met while working on the film &quot;Overboard&quot;. In a February 2020 appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;, she confirmed rumors of their engagement. In 2021, she confirmed they had married in a courthouse ceremony in Washington State.

During a Thanksgiving 2019 dinner, Faris and her guests began experiencing mysterious health symptoms in a Lake Tahoe rental cottage. Local first responders detected carbon monoxide levels six times the recommended maximum.

On January 8, 2025, Faris lost her home in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles due to the Palisades Fire.

<text>The Scarlet Letter: A Romance is a work of historical fiction by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, published in 1850. Set in the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony during the years 1642 to 1649, the novel tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter with a man to whom she is not married and then struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity. As punishment, she must wear a scarlet letter &#x27;A&#x27; (for &quot;adultery&quot;). Containing a number of religious and historic allusions, the book explores themes of legalism, sin and guilt.

&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; was one of the first mass-produced books in the United States. It was popular when first published and is considered a classic work of American literature. Commonly listed among the Great American Novels, it has inspired numerous film, television, and stage adaptations. Critics have described &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; as a masterwork, and novelist D. H. Lawrence called it a &quot;perfect work of the American imagination&quot;.

==Plot==
In Puritan Boston, Massachusetts, a crowd gathers to witness the punishment of Hester Prynne, a young woman who has given birth to a baby of unknown paternity. Her sentence requires her to stand on the scaffold of a former gallows for three hours, exposed to public humiliation, and to wear a scarlet &quot;A&quot; (standing for &quot;adultery&quot;) for the rest of her life. As Hester approaches the scaffold, many of the women in the crowd are angered by her beauty and quiet dignity. When commanded to confess and name the father of her child, Hester refuses.

As Hester looks out over the crowd, she notices a small, misshapen man and recognizes him as her long-lost husband, who had been presumed lost at sea. When he sees Hester&#x27;s shame, he asks a man in the crowd about her and is told the story of his wife&#x27;s pregnancy. He angrily exclaims that the child&#x27;s father should also be punished for his immoral act and vows to find the man. He chooses a new name, Roger Chillingworth, to aid him in his plan.

The Reverend John Wilson and the minister of Hester&#x27;s church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question her, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Chillingworth, now a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage and the fact that they were both in the wrong. Chillingworth demands to know who fathered Hester&#x27;s child, but Hester refuses to divulge that information. He accepts Hester&#x27;s refusal, stating that he will find out the man&#x27;s identity anyway. Chillingworth threatens to destroy the father of Hester&#x27;s child if Hester ever reveals the fact that Chillingworth is her husband. Hester agrees to Chillingworth&#x27;s terms, although she suspects she will regret it.

Following her release from prison, Hester settles in a cottage at the edge of town and earns a meager living with her needlework, which is of extraordinary quality. She lives a quiet, somber life with her daughter, Pearl, and performs acts of charity for the poor. She is troubled by her daughter&#x27;s unusual fascination with the scarlet &quot;A&quot;. The shunning of Hester also extends to Pearl, who has no playmates or friends except her mother. As she grows older, Pearl becomes capricious and unruly. Her conduct sparks controversy, and the church members suggest Pearl be taken away from Hester. Hester, hearing that she may lose Pearl, goes to speak to Governor Bellingham and ministers Wilson and Dimmesdale. Hester appeals to Dimmesdale in desperation, and the minister persuades the governor to let Pearl remain in Hester&#x27;s care.

Because Dimmesdale&#x27;s health has begun to fail, the townspeople are happy to have Chillingworth, the newly arrived physician, take up lodgings with their beloved minister. In close contact with Dimmesdale, Chillingworth begins to suspect that the minister&#x27;s illness is the result of unconfessed guilt. He applies psychological pressure to the minister because he suspects Dimmesdale is Pearl&#x27;s father. One evening, pulling the sleeping Dimmesdale&#x27;s vestment aside, Chillingworth sees a symbol that represents his shame on the minister&#x27;s pale chest.

Tormented by his guilty conscience, Dimmesdale goes to the square where Hester was punished years earlier. Climbing the scaffold in the dead of night, he admits his guilt but cannot find the courage to do so publicly in the light of day. Hester, shocked by Dimmesdale&#x27;s deterioration, decides to obtain a release from her vow of silence to her husband.

Hester meets Dimmesdale in the forest and tells him of her husband and his desire for revenge. She convinces Dimmesdale to leave Boston in secret on a ship to Europe where they can start life anew. Inspired by this plan, the minister seems to gain energy.

On Election Day, Dimmesdale gives one of his most inspired sermons. As the procession leaves the church, however, Dimmesdale climbs upon the scaffold, confesses his sin, and dies in Hester&#x27;s arms. Later, most witnesses swear that they saw a stigma in the form of a scarlet &quot;A&quot; upon his chest, although some deny this statement. Chillingworth loses his vengeance and dies within a year, leaving Pearl a substantial inheritance both in New England as well as in Europe; Hester and Pearl leave for Europe shortly thereafter.

After several years, Hester returns to her cottage without Pearl and resumes wearing the scarlet letter. When she dies, she is buried near the grave of Dimmesdale, and they share a simple slate tombstone engraved with an epitaph described as: &quot;On a field, sable, the letter A, gules&quot; (“On a black background, the letter A in red&quot;).

==Major theme==

Elmer Kennedy-Andrews remarks that Hawthorne in &quot;The Customhouse&quot; sets the context for his story and &quot;tells us about &#x27;romance&#x27;, which is his preferred generic term to describe &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, as his subtitle for the book– &#x27;A Romance&#x27;– would indicate.&quot; In this introduction, Hawthorne describes a space between materialism and &quot;dreaminess&quot; that he calls &quot;a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairyland, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbues itself with nature of the other&quot;. This combination of &quot;dreaminess&quot; and realism gave the author space to explore major themes.

===Other themes===
The experience of Prynne and Dimmesdale recalls the story of Adam and Eve because, in both cases, sin results in expulsion and suffering. But it also results in knowledge – specifically, in knowledge of what it means to be immoral. For Prynne, the Scarlet Letter is a physical manifestation of her sin and reminder of her painful solitude. She contemplates casting it off to obtain her freedom from an oppressive society and a checkered past as well as the absence of God. Because the society excludes her, she considers the possibility that many of the traditions upheld by the Puritan culture are untrue and are not designed to bring her happiness.

As for Dimmesdale, the &quot;cheating minister&quot;, his sin gives him &quot;sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind&quot; &quot;that his chest vibrate[s] in unison with theirs.&quot; His eloquent and powerful sermons derive from this sense of empathy. The Dimmesdale narrative is quite in keeping with the oldest and most fully authorized principles in Christian thought. His &quot;fall&quot; is a descent from apparent grace to his own damnation; he appears to begin in purity, but he ends in corruption. The subtlety is that the minister&#x27;s belief is his own cheating, convincing himself at every stage of his spiritual pilgrimage that he is saved.

Throughout the work, the nature images contrast with the stark darkness of the Puritans and their systems. A rose bush&#x27;s beauty forms a striking contrast to all that surrounds it. Later, the beautifully embroidered scarlet &quot;A&quot; is held out in part as an invitation to find &quot;some sweet moral blossom&quot; in the ensuing, tragic tale and in part as an image that &quot;the deep heart of nature&quot; (perhaps God) may look kindlier on the errant Prynne and her child than her Puritan neighbors do.

Chillingworth&#x27;s misshapen body reflects (or symbolizes) the anger in his soul, just as Dimmesdale&#x27;s illness reveals his inner turmoil. The outward man reflects the condition of the heart. This observation is thought to have been inspired by the deterioration of Edgar Allan Poe, whom Hawthorne &quot;much admired&quot;.

Another theme is the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Prynne chose not to conform to their rules and beliefs. Prynne was rejected by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor. Because she was shunned, she spent her life mostly in solitude and did not attend church. Instead, she retreated into her own mind and her own thinking. Her thoughts began to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the Puritans as safe. She still saw her sin, but she began to look on it differently than the villagers did. Prynne began to believe that a person&#x27;s earthly sins do not necessarily condemn them. She even went so far as to tell Dimmesdale that their sin had been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin would not prevent them from reaching heaven.

Prynne was alienated from Puritan society, both in her physical life and spiritual life. When Dimmesdale died, she knew she had to move on because she could no longer conform to the Puritans&#x27; strictness. Her thinking was free from Puritan religious bounds, and she had established her own moral standards and beliefs.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; was first published in the spring of 1850 by Ticknor and Fields, beginning Hawthorne&#x27;s most lucrative period. When he delivered the final pages to Fields in February 1850, Hawthorne said that &quot;some portions of the book are powerfully written&quot; but doubted it would be popular. In fact, the book was an instant best-seller, though, over fourteen years, it brought its author only $1,500. Its initial publication brought wide protest from natives of Salem, who did not approve of how Hawthorne had depicted them in his introduction &quot;The Custom-House&quot;. A 2,500-copy second edition included a preface by Hawthorne dated March 30, 1850, that stated he had decided to reprint his Introduction &quot;without the change of a word... The only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine good humor... As to enmity, or ill-feeling of any kind, personal or political, he utterly disclaims such motives&quot;.

Hawthorne wrote the manuscript at the Peter Edgerley House in Salem, Massachusetts, still standing as a private residence at 14 Mall Street. It was the last Salem home where the Hawthorne family lived.

&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; was also one of the first mass-produced books in America. In the mid-nineteenth century, bookbinders of home-grown literature typically hand-made their books and sold them in small quantities. The first mechanized printing of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, 2,500 volumes, sold out within ten days. 

It was long held that Hawthorne originally planned &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; to be a shorter novelette, part of a collection named &quot;Old Time Legends&quot;, and that his publisher, James T. Fields, convinced him to expand the work to a full-length novel. This is not true: Fields persuaded Hawthorne to publish &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; alone (along with the earlier-completed &quot;Custom House&quot; essay) but he had nothing to do with the length of the story. Hawthorne&#x27;s wife Sophia later challenged Fields&#x27; claims a little inexactly: &quot;he has made the absurd boast that &quot;he&quot; was the sole cause of the Scarlet Letter being published!&quot; She noted that her husband&#x27;s friend Edwin Percy Whipple, a critic, approached Fields to consider its publication. 

A signed first edition, first printing of &quot;Scarlet Letter&quot; from March 1850 published by Ticknor, Reed and Fields sold for $22,500. Unsigned, the retail price was estimated in 2014 at $12,500.

==Critical response==
On its publication, critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck, a friend of Hawthorne&#x27;s, said he preferred the author&#x27;s Washington Irving-like tales. Another friend, critic Edwin Percy Whipple, objected to the novel&#x27;s &quot;morbid intensity&quot; with dense psychological details, writing that the book &quot;is therefore apt to become, like Hawthorne, too painfully anatomical in his exhibition of them&quot;. English writer Mary Anne Evans writing as &quot;George Eliot&quot;, called &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, along with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1855 book-length poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, the &quot;two most indigenous and masterly productions in American literature&quot;. Most literary critics praised the book but religious leaders took issue with the novel&#x27;s subject matter. Orestes Brownson alleged that Hawthorne did not understand Christianity, confession, and remorse. A review in &quot;The Church Review and Ecclesiastical Register&quot; concluded the author &quot;perpetrates bad morals.&quot;

On the other hand, 20th-century writer D. H. Lawrence said that there could not be a more perfect work of the American imagination than &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. Henry James once said of the novel, &quot;It is beautiful, admirable, extraordinary; it has in the highest degree that merit which I have spoken of as the mark of Hawthorne&#x27;s best things—an indefinable purity and lightness of conception...One can often return to it; it supports familiarity and has the inexhaustible charm and mystery of great works of art.&quot;

==Allusions==
The following historical and Biblical references appear in &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;.
* Anne Hutchinson, mentioned in Chapter 1, &quot;The Prison Door&quot;, was a religious dissenter (1591–1643). In the 1630s she was excommunicated by the Puritans and exiled from Boston, and moved to Rhode Island.
* Ann Hibbins, who historically was executed for witchcraft in Boston in 1656, is depicted in &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; as a witch who tries to tempt Prynne to the practice of witchcraft.
* Richard Bellingham (c. 1592–1672), who historically was the governor of Massachusetts and deputy governor at the time of Hibbins&#x27;s execution, was depicted in &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; as the brother of Ann Hibbins.
* Martin Luther (1483–1545) was a leader of the Protestant Reformation in Germany.
* Increase Mather (1639–1723), a powerful leader of the early Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was a Puritan minister involved with the government of the colony, and also the Salem Witch Trials.
* Sir Thomas Overbury and Dr. Forman were the subjects of an adultery scandal in 1615 in England. Dr. Forman was charged with trying to poison his adulterous wife and her lover. Overbury was a friend of the lover and was perhaps poisoned.
* John Winthrop (1588–1649), second governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
* King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground, mentioned in the final paragraph, exists; the Elizabeth Pain gravestone is traditionally considered an inspiration for the protagonists&#x27; grave.
* The story of King David and Bathsheba is depicted in the tapestry in Mr. Dimmesdale&#x27;s room (chapter 9). (See II Samuel 11–12 for the Biblical story.)
* John Eliot (c. 1604–1690) was a Puritan missionary to the American Indians whom some called &quot;the apostle to the Indians&quot;. He is referred to as &quot;the Apostle Eliot&quot; whom Dimmesdale has gone to visit at the beginning of Chapter 16, &quot;A Forest Walk&quot;.

==Symbols==
The following are symbols that are embedded in &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;:
* The Scarlet Letter &quot;A&quot;: In the beginning of the novel, Hester&#x27;s letter &quot;A&quot; is a representation of her sin and adultery. However, as time progresses, the meaning of the letter changed. To some, it now meant &quot;able&quot;. The novel states, &quot;The letter was the symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness was found in her—so much power to do, and power to sympathize—that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification. They said that it meant Able, so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman&#x27;s strength&quot;.
* Meteor: The meteor shaped as an A serves as another symbol in the book. To Reverend Dimmesdale, the meteor is a sign from God. God is revealing Dimmesdale&#x27;s sin to everyone, and Dimmesdale is ridden with guilt. However, others perceived the letter to be the symbol of an angel.
* Dimmesdale&#x27;s name: Dimmesdale&#x27;s name itself also holds symbolism. His name contains the root word &quot;dim&quot;, which evokes faintness, weakness, and gloom and represents Dimmesdale&#x27;s constant state since the commission of his sin.
* Pearl: Pearl is the embodiment of her parents&#x27; sin and passion. She is a constant reminder of the sin from which her mother cannot escape. It is mentioned she &quot;was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed in life&quot;.
* Rosebush: The rosebush is mentioned twice within the course of the story. It is first viewed as nature&#x27;s way of offering beauty to those who leave and enter the prison, as well as providing a glimmer of hope to those who inhabit it. The rosebush is perceived as a symbol of brightness in a story filled with human sorrow.
* The Scaffold: The scaffold is mentioned three times throughout the novel. It can be viewed as separating the book into its beginning, middle, and end. It symbolizes shame, revelation of sin, and guilt, for it is the location where Hester received her scarlet letter as punishment and where Dimmesdale experienced his revelation through the meteor.

==Adaptations and influence==

&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; has inspired numerous film, television, and stage adaptations, and plot elements have influenced several novels, musical works, and screen productions.

===Stage===
&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; appeared as a stage play as early as February 24, 1858, when an adaptation by George L. Aiken opened at Barnum&#x27;s American Museum. George C. Howard and his wife starred as Dimmesdale and Hester.

Walter Damrosch in 1896 premiered an opera, &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Twentieth century American composer Marjorie Rusche’s opera &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is based on Hawthorne’s work.

===Film===

The story has been adapted to film multiple times, typically using the same title as the novel. The first film adaptation was a 1908 short film. This lost silent film was directed by Sidney Olcott from a screenplay by Gene Gauntier, who also starred as Hester. The oldest surviving film adaptation is a The Scarlet Letter (1911 film) directed by Joseph W. Smiley and George Loane Tucker, with Lucille Young as Hester and King Baggot as Dimmesdale. The film has been subsequently adapted in 1926 (dir. Victor Sjöström), 1934 (dir. Robert G. Vignola), 1973 (dir. Wim Wenders), as television miniseries in 1979, another film in 1995 (dir. by Roland Joffé starring Demi Moore) and the novel also partially inspired &quot;Easy A&quot; (dir. by Will Gluck) from a screenplay by Bert V. Royal and starring Emma Stone.

===Literary sequels===

John Updike rewrote &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; in his &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; trilogy &quot;S.&quot;, &quot;A Month of Sundays&quot; and &quot;Roger&#x27;s Version&quot;. Patricia Suprenant&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Scarlet Letter: Based on a True Story&quot; (2024) tells the story of the actual 19th-century legal case which formed the basis for Hawthorne&#x27;s novel and which, as a chapter in the history of the criminalization of abortion in America, prefigured &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

<text>Varahagiri Venkata Giri (; 10 August 1894 – 24 June 1980), better known as V. V. Giri was an Indian politician and activist who served as the president of India from 24 August 1969 to 24 August 1974. He also served as the vice president of India from 13 May 1967 to 3 May 1969. He was the first president to be elected as an independent candidate. He was succeeded by Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed as president in 1974. After the end of his full term, Giri was honoured by the Government of India with the Bharat Ratna in 1975. Giri died on 24 June 1980.

==Early life and family==
V. V. Giri was born in Berhampur, Madras Presidency (present-day Odisha) in a Telugu Brahmin family. His parents hailed from Chintalapudi village in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh and shifted to Berhampur for their bright future. His father, V. V. Jogayya Pantulu, was a successful lawyer and political activist of the Indian National Congress who had been working at Berhampur. Giri&#x27;s mother Subhadramma was active in the national movement in Berhampur during the Non Cooperation and Civil Disobedience Movements and was arrested for leading a strike for prohibition during the Civil Disobedience Movement.

Giri was married to Saraswati Bai and the couple had 14 children.

Giri completed his initial primary education at Hillpatna Primary School, Berhampur and higher education at the Khallikote College {now Khallikote College (Autonomous) and Unitary University}, then affiliated with Madras University, in Chennai. V.V. Giri was also elected to the student union of Khallikote College for three consecutive times and highly active in freedom movement during his student days in Berhampur.

In 1913, he moved to Ireland to study law at University College Dublin and the Honourable Society of King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin between 1913 and 1916. Giri was one among the first group of thirteen Indian students who sat the obligatory year long course at UCD in 1914–15. This was a requirement for being called to the Irish Bar through study at the King&#x27;s Inns. In total, 50 Indian students studied at UCD between 1914 and 1917.

Giri and a fellow law student also enrolled in the full bachelor of arts course in UCD. Giri studied English, where he was met Thomas MacDonagh, and Political Economy. His lecturer in political economy was the reformer and co-operativist Thomas A. Finlay SJ.

During the First World War, Giri travelled from Dublin to London and met Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi wanted Giri to join the Imperial war effort as a Red Cross Volunteer. Giri initially acceded to Gandhi&#x27;s request but later regretted his decision. According to one of Giri&#x27;s biographers, &quot;Gandhiji with his characteristic magnanimity relieved Giri of the obligation to join the Red Cross and did not breathe a word about it to anyone.”

Giri was active in both Indian and Irish politics during his studies. Along with fellow Indian students he produced a pamphlet documenting the abuse of Indians in South Africa. The pamphlet was intercepted by Indian Political Intelligence and resulted in increased police scrutiny of Giri and his fellow students in Dublin. Meanwhile, anonymous articles were written by Indian students for the newspaper of the Irish Volunteers and in &quot;The National Student&quot;, a UCD student magazine.

He was suspected of association with prominent ring leaders in the 1916 Rising including James Connolly, Pádraig H. Pearse and the young Éamon de Valera. Giri was called to the Irish Bar on 21 June 1916 but he did not complete his studies for BA in UCD. Indian students were subjected to police raids following the 1916 Rising and Giri recounts how he was served with one month&#x27;s notice to leave Ireland on 1 June 1916.

==Career==
Upon returning to India in 1916 Giri enrolled at the Madras High Court. He also became a member of the Congress party, attended its Lucknow session and joined the Home Rule Movement of Annie Besant. Giri abandoned a flourishing legal career in response to Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s call for a Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920. In 1922, he was arrested for the first time for demonstrating against the sale of liquor shops.

=== Role in the labour movement ===
Giri was closely associated with the labour and trade union movement in India throughout his career. Giri was a founding member of the All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation which was formed in 1923 and served as its general secretary for over a decade. He was elected president of the All India Trade Union Congress for the first time in 1926. Giri also founded the Bengal Nagpur Railway Association and in 1928 led the workers of the Bengal Nagpur Railway in a non violent strike for the rights of retrenched workers. The strike succeeded in forcing the British Indian government and the management of the railway company to concede the workers&#x27; demands and is regarded as a milestone in the labour movement in India. In 1929, the Indian Trade Union Federation (ITUF) was formed by Giri, N. M. Joshi and others with Giri as the president. The split with the AITUC came about over the issue of cooperating with the Royal Commission on Labour. Giri and the ITUF leadership of liberals decided to cooperate with the commission while the AITUC decided to boycott it. The ITUF merged with the AITUC in 1939 and Giri became president of the AITUC for a second time in 1942.

Giri was the Workers&#x27; Delegate of the Indian delegation at the International Labour Conference of the ILO in 1927. At the Second Round Table Conference, Giri was present as a representative of the industrial workers of India. Giri worked towards getting the trade unions to support the freedom movement in India and was twice president of the AITUC which was closely allied with the Indian National Congress.

==Electoral career in British India ==
Giri became a member of the Imperial Legislative Assembly in 1934. He remained its member until 1937 and emerged a spokesman for matters of labour and trade unions in the Assembly.

In the General Elections of 1936, Giri defeated the Raja of Bobbili to become a member of the Madras Legislative Assembly. Between 1937 and 1939, he was Minister for Labour and Industry in the Congress government headed by C Rajagopalachari. Giri was appointed Governor of the National Planning Committee of the Indian National Congress in 1938. In 1939, the Congress ministries resigned in protest against the British decision to make India a party in the Second World War. Having returned to the labour movement, Giri was arrested and spent 15 months in prison until March 1941.

Following the launch of the Quit India Movement, Giri was imprisoned again by the colonial government in 1942. He remained in prison when the AITUC met in Nagpur in 1943 where he was the president elect. Giri served his sentence in the Vellore and Amaravathi prisons. Giri remained in prison for three years, his longest sentence, until his release in 1945.

In the General Elections of 1946, Giri was reelected to the Madras Legislative Assembly and became a minister again in charge of the labour portfolio under T. Prakasam.

==Career in independent India==
From 1947 to 1951, Giri served as India&#x27;s first High Commissioner to Ceylon. In the General Elections of 1951, he was elected to the 1st Lok Sabha from Pathapatnam Lok Sabha Constituency in the Madras State.

=== Union Minister for Labour (1952–1954) ===
On being elected to Parliament, Giri was appointed Minister of Labour in 1952. His policy initiatives as minister gave rise to the &quot;Giri Approach&quot; in industrial dispute resolution. The Giri approach emphasizes negotiations between the management and workers as the means for resolving industrial disputes. It holds that the failure of such negotiations should lead not to compulsory adjudication but to further negotiations through conciliation officers. However, differences with the government over patronage to trade unions, trade union and government opposition to the Giri Approach and the government&#x27;s decision to reduce the wages of bank employees led him to resign from government in August 1954.

In the General Elections of 1957, Giri lost from the Parvatipuram double-member constituency. Giri played an important role in founding the Indian Society of Labour Economics (ISLE). In June 1957, he was appointed Governor of Uttar Pradesh.

=== Gubernatorial tenures (1957–1967) ===
Between 1957 and 1967, Giri served as governor of Uttar Pradesh (1957–1960), Kerala (1960–1965) and Karnataka (1965–1967).

==== Governor of Kerala (1960–1965) ====
Giri was sworn in as the second Governor of Kerala on 1 July 1960. As Governor, Giri&#x27;s active voicing of Kerala&#x27;s fiscal needs with the Planning Commission led to the state being allocated significantly more funds in the Third Five Year Plan. When defections from the ruling Congress Party reduced the government to a minority, Giri recommended the imposition of President&#x27;s Rule in Kerala after determining that an alternative government could not be formed. A hung assembly resulted from the elections to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1965. Since no party had a majority and no alliances commanding a majority could be formed, Giri again recommended the dissolution of the assembly and the imposition of President&#x27;s Rule in the state.

=== Vice president (1967–1969) and acting president of India (1969) ===
Giri was elected the third vice president of India on 13 May 1967, a post he held for nearly two years until 3 May 1969. Giri was the first vice president to not complete his full term in office on account of being elevated to the office of the president and was the third vice president to be elected to the presidency.

Following the death in office of President Zakir Husain on 3 May 1969, Giri was sworn in as acting president the same day. Giri resigned from his post on 20 July 1969 to contest the presidential elections as an independent candidate. Immediately before resigning, Giri, in his capacity as acting president, promulgated an ordinance that nationalised 14 banks and insurance companies. He was succeeded as acting president by Mohammad Hidayatullah, the Chief Justice of India.

=== Presidential election of 1969 ===
The election of a new president became a contest between the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the old guard of the Congress Party known as the Syndicate. The All India Congress Committee decided to support Neelam Sanjiva Reddy as the presidential candidate, disregarding the Prime Minister&#x27;s opposition. Giri, who was vice president, resigned and decided to contest as an independent candidate. Prime Minister Gandhi then decided to support him, endorsing a &quot;vote of conscience&quot; that allowed Congress legislators to vote for Giri. The election, held on 16 August 1969, witnessed a contest between Reddy, Giri and the opposition candidate C D Deshmukh. In the closely fought election V V Giri emerged victorious, winning 48.01 per cent of the first preference votes and subsequently getting a majority on counting the second preference votes. In the final tally, Giri had 420,077 votes against the quota of 418,169 votes required to be elected president.

Following Giri&#x27;s election, an election petition was filed in the Supreme Court of India contesting its validity on the grounds of having used corrupt practices to influence voters. Giri, unusually for an incumbent president of India, chose to appear in person before the Court where he was examined as a witness. The Court ultimately dismissed the petition and upheld Giri&#x27;s election as president.

== President of India ==

Giri was sworn in as President of India on 24 August 1969 and held office until 24 August 1974 when he was succeeded by Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. On his election, Giri became the only president to have also been an acting president and the only person to be elected president as an independent candidate.

As president, Giri unquestioningly accepted Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s decision to sack the Charan Singh ministry in Uttar Pradesh and advised her to go in for early elections in 1971. The ordinance abolishing privy purses and privileges of the erstwhile rulers of India&#x27;s princely states was promulgated by Giri after the government&#x27;s original amendment was defeated in the Rajya Sabha. His advice to Prime Minister Gandhi against the appointment of A. N. Ray as the Chief Justice of India superseding three judges senior to him was ignored by her as was his warning that a crackdown on striking railwaymen would only exacerbate the situation. As president, Giri made 14 state visits to 22 countries in south and southeast Asia, Europe and Africa.

Giri is regarded as a president who completely subordinated himself to the prime minister and has been described as a &quot;Prime Minister’s President&quot;, a loyalist president and a rubber stamp president under whom the independence of the office eroded. When Giri&#x27;s term ended in 1974, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi chose not to renominate him to the presidency and instead chose Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, who was elected in the presidential election of 1974.

==Awards and honours==

===National honours===
** Bharat Ratna (1975)
===Foreign honours===
** Commemorative Medal of the 2500th Anniversary of the Founding of the Persian Empire (1971)
Giri was honoured with India&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, in 1975 for his contributions in the area of public affairs. As president, Giri had suo motu conferred the Bharat Ratna on Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1971. Giri was in turn conferred the Bharat Ratna in 1975 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Gandhi, in an act seen as a quid pro quo measure. Giri was the fourth of the six Presidents of India to have been conferred the Bharat Ratna (viz. Rajendra Prasad, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Zakir Husain, V. V. Giri, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Pranab Mukherjee).

==Death ==
V.V. Giri died of a heart attack in his Madras residency, on 24 June 1980.

He was given a state funeral the next day and a week-long mourning period was declared by the Government of India. Rajya Sabha, of which Giri had been ex-officio chairman as Vice President of India, adjourned for two days as a mark of respect to him.

== Commemoration ==

A commemorative postage stamp on V.V. Giri was released by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department in 1974. The National Labour Institute was renamed in honour of V.V. Giri in 1995. V.V. Giri&#x27;s hometown of Berhampur in Odisha has a major road, a secondary training school and a big market that are named after him. V.V.Giri donated his huge &amp; historic bungalow in Brahmapur for a Girls School (Now its famous as GIRI Girls High School. It is also the first girls&#x27; school and a famous secondary government school in Odisha). The British time market &#x27;Victoria Market&#x27; is also renamed as GIRI Market in Berhampur. The family members of VV Giri resides in another small bungalow at Giri Road in Berhampur.

Giri authored &quot;Industrial Relations&quot; and &quot;Labour Problems in Indian Industry&quot;, two popular books on issues of labour in India. His memoirs, published in 1976, are titled &quot;My Life and Times&quot;.

<text>Electron diffraction is a generic term for phenomena associated with changes in the direction of electron beams due to elastic interactions with atoms. It occurs due to elastic scattering, when there is no change in the energy of the electrons. The negatively charged electrons are scattered due to Coulomb forces when they interact with both the positively charged atomic core and the negatively charged electrons around the atoms. The resulting map of the directions of the electrons far from the sample is called a diffraction pattern, see for instance Figure 1. Beyond patterns showing the directions of electrons, electron diffraction also plays a major role in the contrast of images in electron microscopes.

This article provides an overview of electron diffraction and electron diffraction patterns, collective referred to by the generic name electron diffraction. This includes aspects of how in a general way electrons can act as waves, and diffract and interact with matter. It also involves the extensive history behind modern electron diffraction, how the combination of developments in the 19th century in understanding and controlling electrons in vacuum and the early 20th century developments with electron waves were combined with early instruments, giving birth to electron microscopy and diffraction in 1920–1935. While this was the birth, there have been a large number of further developments since then.

There are many types and techniques of electron diffraction. The most common approach is where the electrons transmit through a thin sample, from 1 nm to 100 nm (10 to 1000 atoms thick), where the results depending upon how the atoms are arranged in the material, for instance a single crystal, many crystals or different types of solids. Other cases such as larger repeats, no periodicity or disorder have their own characteristic patterns. There are many different ways of collecting diffraction information, from parallel illumination to a converging beam of electrons or where the beam is rotated or scanned across the sample which produce information that is often easier to interpret. There are also many other types of instruments. For instance, in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction can be used to determine crystal orientation across the sample. Electron diffraction patterns can also be used to characterize molecules using gas electron diffraction, liquids, surfaces using lower energy electrons, a technique called LEED, and by reflecting electrons off surfaces, a technique called RHEED.

There are also many levels of analysis of electron diffraction, including:
# The simplest approximation using the de Broglie wavelength for electrons, where only the geometry is considered and often Bragg&#x27;s law is invoked. This approach only considers the electrons far from the sample, a far-field or Fraunhofer approach.
# The first level of more accuracy where it is approximated that the electrons are only scattered once, which is called kinematical diffraction and is also a far-field or Fraunhofer approach. 
# More complete and accurate explanations where multiple scattering is included, what is called dynamical diffraction (e.g. refs). These involve more general analyses using relativistically corrected Schrödinger equation methods, and track the electrons through the sample, being accurate both near and far from the sample (both Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction).

Electron diffraction is similar to x-ray and neutron diffraction. However, unlike x-ray and neutron diffraction where the simplest approximations are quite accurate, with electron diffraction this is not the case. Simple models give the geometry of the intensities in a diffraction pattern, but dynamical diffraction approaches are needed for accurate intensities and the positions of diffraction spots.

== A primer on electron diffraction ==
All matter can be thought of as matter waves, from small particles such as electrons up to macroscopic objects – although it is impossible to measure any of the &quot;wave-like&quot; behavior of macroscopic objects. Waves can move around objects and create interference patterns, and a classic example is the Young&#x27;s two-slit experiment shown in Figure 2, where a wave impinges upon two slits in the first of the two images (blue waves). After going through the slits there are directions where the wave is stronger, ones where it is weaker – the wave has been diffracted. If instead of two slits there are a number of small points then similar phenomena can occur as shown in the second image where the wave (red and blue) is coming in from the bottom right corner. This is comparable to diffraction of an electron wave where the small dots would be atoms in a small crystal, see also note. Note the strong dependence on the relative orientation of the crystal and the incoming wave.
Close to an aperture or atoms, often called the &quot;sample&quot;, the electron wave would be described in terms of near field or Fresnel diffraction. This has relevance for imaging within electron microscopes, whereas electron diffraction patterns are measured far from the sample, which is described as far-field or Fraunhofer diffraction. A map of the directions of the electron waves leaving the sample will show high intensity (white) for favored directions, such as the three prominent ones in the Young&#x27;s two-slit experiment of Figure 2, while the other directions will be low intensity (dark). Often there will be an array of spots (preferred directions) as in Figure 1 and the other figures shown later.

== History ==
The historical background is divided into several subsections. The first is the general background to electrons in vacuum and the technological developments that led to cathode-ray tubes as well as vacuum tubes that dominated early television and electronics; the second is how these led to the development of electron microscopes; the last is work on the nature of electron beams and the fundamentals of how electrons behave, a key component of quantum mechanics and the explanation of electron diffraction.

=== Electrons in vacuum ===

Experiments involving electron beams occurred long before the discovery of the electron; (ἤλεκτρον) is the Greek word for amber, which is connected to the recording of electrostatic charging by Thales of Miletus around 585 BCE, and possibly others even earlier.

In 1650, Otto von Guericke invented the vacuum pump allowing for the study of the effects of high voltage electricity passing through rarefied air. In 1838, Michael Faraday applied a high voltage between two metal electrodes at either end of a glass tube that had been partially evacuated of air, and noticed a strange light arc with its beginning at the cathode (negative electrode) and its end at the anode (positive electrode). Building on this, in the 1850s, Heinrich Geissler was able to achieve a pressure of around 10−3 atmospheres, inventing what became known as Geissler tubes. Using these tubes, while studying electrical conductivity in rarefied gases in 1859, Julius Plücker observed that the radiation emitted from the negatively charged cathode caused phosphorescent light to appear on the tube wall near it, and the region of the phosphorescent light could be moved by application of a magnetic field.

In 1869, Plücker&#x27;s student Johann Wilhelm Hittorf found that a solid body placed between the cathode and the phosphorescence would cast a shadow on the tube wall, e.g. Figure 3. Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls. In 1876 Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays were emitted perpendicular to the cathode surface, which differentiated them from the incandescent light. Eugen Goldstein dubbed them cathode rays. By the 1870s William Crookes and others were able to evacuate glass tubes below 10−6 atmospheres, and observed that the glow in the tube disappeared when the pressure was reduced but the glass behind the anode began to glow. Crookes was also able to show that the particles in the cathode rays were negatively charged and could be deflected by an electromagnetic field.

In 1897, Joseph Thomson measured the mass of these cathode rays, proving they were made of particles. These particles, however, were 1800 times lighter than the lightest particle known at that time – a hydrogen atom. These were originally called &quot;corpuscles&quot; and later named electrons by George Johnstone Stoney.

The control of electron beams that this work led to resulted in significant technology advances in electronic amplifiers and television displays.

=== Waves, diffraction and quantum mechanics ===
Independent of the developments for electrons in vacuum, at about the same time the components of quantum mechanics were being assembled. In 1924 Louis de Broglie in his PhD thesis &quot;Recherches sur la théorie des quanta&quot; introduced his theory of electron waves. He suggested that an electron around a nucleus could be thought of as standing waves, and that electrons and all matter could be considered as waves. He merged the idea of thinking about them as particles (or corpuscles), and of thinking of them as waves. He proposed that particles are bundles of waves (wave packets) that move with a group velocity and have an effective mass, see for instance Figure 4. Both of these depend upon the energy, which in turn connects to the wavevector and the relativistic formulation of Albert Einstein a few years before.

This rapidly became part of what was called by Erwin Schrödinger &quot;undulatory mechanics&quot;, now called the Schrödinger equation or wave mechanics. As stated by Louis de Broglie on September 8, 1927, in the preface to the German translation of his theses (in turn translated into English):&quot;M. Einstein from the beginning has supported my thesis, but it was M. E. Schrödinger who developed the propagation equations of a new theory and who in searching for its solutions has established what has become known as “Wave Mechanics”.&quot;
The Schrödinger equation combines the kinetic energy of waves and the potential energy due to, for electrons, the Coulomb potential. He was able to explain earlier work such as the quantization of the energy of electrons around atoms in the Bohr model, as well as many other phenomena. Electron waves as hypothesized by de Broglie were automatically part of the solutions to his equation, see also introduction to quantum mechanics and matter waves.

Both the wave nature and the undulatory mechanics approach were experimentally confirmed for electron beams by experiments from two groups performed independently, the first the Davisson–Germer experiment, the other by George Paget Thomson and Alexander Reid; see note for more discussion. Alexander Reid, who was Thomson&#x27;s graduate student, performed the first experiments, but he died soon after in a motorcycle accident and is rarely mentioned. These experiments were rapidly followed by the first non-relativistic diffraction model for electrons by Hans Bethe based upon the Schrödinger equation, which is very close to how electron diffraction is now described. Significantly, Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer noticed that their results could not be interpreted using a Bragg&#x27;s law approach as the positions were systematically different; the approach of Hans Bethe which includes the refraction due to the average potential yielded more accurate results. These advances in understanding of electron wave mechanics were important for many developments of electron-based analytical techniques such as Seishi Kikuchi&#x27;s observations of lines due to combined elastic and inelastic scattering, gas electron diffraction developed by Herman Mark and Raymond Weil, diffraction in liquids by Louis Maxwell, and the first electron microscopes developed by Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska.

=== Electron microscopes and early electron diffraction ===
In order to have a practical microscope or diffractometer, just having an electron beam was not enough, it needed to be controlled. Many developments laid the groundwork of electron optics; see the paper by Chester J. Calbick for an overview of the early work. One significant step was the work of Heinrich Hertz in 1883 who made a cathode-ray tube with electrostatic and magnetic deflection, demonstrating manipulation of the direction of an electron beam. Others were focusing of electrons by an axial magnetic field by Emil Wiechert in 1899, improved oxide-coated cathodes which produced more electrons by Arthur Wehnelt in 1905 and the development of the electromagnetic lens in 1926 by Hans Busch.

Building an electron microscope involves combining these elements, similar to an optical microscope but with magnetic or electrostatic lenses instead of glass ones. To this day the issue of who invented the transmission electron microscope is controversial, as discussed by Thomas Mulvey and more recently by Yaping Tao. Extensive additional information can be found in the articles by Martin Freundlich, Reinhold Rüdenberg and Mulvey.

One effort was university based. In 1928, at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin), (Professor of High Voltage Technology and Electrical Installations) appointed Max Knoll to lead a team of researchers to advance research on electron beams and cathode-ray oscilloscopes. The team consisted of several PhD students including Ernst Ruska. In 1931, Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over an anode aperture. The device, a replicate of which is shown in Figure 5, used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, the first electron microscope. (Max Knoll died in 1969, so did not receive a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.)

Apparently independent of this effort was work at Siemens-Schuckert by Reinhold Rudenberg. According to patent law (U.S. Patent No. 2058914 and 2070318, both filed in 1932), he is the inventor of the electron microscope, but it is not clear when he had a working instrument. He stated in a very brief article in 1932 that Siemens had been working on this for some years before the patents were filed in 1932, so his effort was parallel to the university effort. He died in 1961, so similar to Max Knoll, was not eligible for a share of the Nobel Prize.

These instruments could produce magnified images, but were not particularly useful for electron diffraction; indeed, the wave nature of electrons was not exploited during the development. Key for electron diffraction in microscopes was the advance in 1936 where showed that they could be used as micro-diffraction cameras with an aperture—the birth of selected area electron diffraction.

Less controversial was the development of LEED—the early experiments of Davisson and Germer used this approach. As early as 1929 Germer investigated gas adsorption, and in 1932 Harrison E. Farnsworth probed single crystals of copper and silver. However, the vacuum systems available at that time were not good enough to properly control the surfaces, and it took almost forty years before these became available. Similarly, it was not until about 1965 that Peter B. Sewell and M. Cohen demonstrated the power of RHEED in a system with a very well controlled vacuum.

=== Subsequent developments in methods and modelling ===
Despite early successes such as the determination of the positions of hydrogen atoms in NH4Cl crystals by W. E. Laschkarew and I. D. Usykin in 1933, boric acid by John M. Cowley in 1953 and orthoboric acid by William Houlder Zachariasen in 1954, electron diffraction for many years was a qualitative technique used to check samples within electron microscopes. John M Cowley explains in a 1968 paper: &quot;Thus was founded the belief, amounting in some cases almost to an article of faith, and persisting even to the present day, that it is impossible to interpret the intensities of electron diffraction patterns to gain structural information.&quot;This has changed, in transmission, reflection and for low energies. Some of the key developments (some of which are also described later) from the early days to 2023 have been:
* Fast numerical methods based upon the Cowley–Moodie multislice algorithm, which only became possible once the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method was developed. With these and other numerical methods Fourier transforms are fast, and it became possible to calculate accurate, dynamical diffraction in seconds to minutes with laptops using widely available multislice programs.
* Developments in the convergent-beam electron diffraction approach. Building on the original work of Walther Kossel and Gottfried Möllenstedt in 1939, it was extended by Peter Goodman and Gunter Lehmpfuhl, then mainly by the groups of John Steeds and Michiyoshi Tanaka who showed how to determine point groups and space groups. It can also be used for higher-level refinements of the electron density; for a brief history see CBED history. In many cases this is the best method to determine symmetry.
* The development of new approaches to reduce dynamical effects such as precession electron diffraction and three-dimensional diffraction methods. Averaging over different directions has, empirically, been found to significantly reduce dynamical diffraction effects, e.g., see PED history for further details. Not only is it easier to identify known structures with this approach, it can also be used to solve unknown structures in some cases – see precession electron diffraction for further information.
* The development of experimental methods exploiting ultra-high vacuum technologies (e.g. the approach described by in 1953) to better control surfaces, making LEED and RHEED more reliable and reproducible techniques. In the early days the surfaces were not well controlled; with these technologies they can both be cleaned and remain clean for hours to days, a key component of surface science. 
* Fast and accurate methods to calculate intensities for LEED so it could be used to determine atomic positions, for instance references. These have been extensively exploited to determine the structure of many surfaces, and the arrangement of foreign atoms on surfaces.
* Methods to simulate the intensities in RHEED, so it can be used semi-quantitatively to understand surfaces during growth and thereby to control the resulting materials. 
* The development of advanced detectors for transmission electron microscopy such as charge-coupled device and direct electron detectors, which improve the accuracy and reliability of intensity measurements. These have efficiencies and accuracies that can be a thousand or more times that of the photographic film used in the earliest experiments, with the information available in real time rather than requiring photographic processing after the experiment.

== Core elements of electron diffraction ==
=== Plane waves, wavevectors and reciprocal lattice ===
What is seen in an electron diffraction pattern depends upon the sample and also the energy of the electrons. The electrons need to be considered as waves, which involves describing the electron via a wavefunction, written in crystallographic notation (see notes and) as:formula_1for a position formula_2. This is a quantum mechanics description; one cannot use a classical approach. The vector formula_3 is called the wavevector, has units of inverse nanometers, and the form above is called a plane wave as the term inside the exponential is constant on the surface of a plane. The vector formula_3 is what is used when drawing ray diagrams, and in vacuum is parallel to the direction or, better, group velocity or probability current of the plane wave. For most cases the electrons are travelling at a respectable fraction of the speed of light, so rigorously need to be considered using relativistic quantum mechanics via the Dirac equation, which as spin does not normally matter can be reduced to the Klein–Gordon equation. Fortunately one can side-step many complications and use a non-relativistic approach based around the Schrödinger equation. Following Kunio Fujiwara and Archibald Howie, the relationship between the total energy of the electrons and the wavevector is written as:formula_5withformula_6where formula_7 is the Planck constant, formula_8 is a relativistic effective mass used to cancel out the relativistic terms for electrons of energy formula_9 with formula_10 the speed of light and formula_11 the rest mass of the electron. The concept of effective mass occurs throughout physics (see for instance Ashcroft and Mermin), and comes up in the behavior of quasiparticles. A common one is the electron hole, which acts as if it is a particle with a positive charge and a mass similar to that of an electron, although it can be several times lighter or heavier. For electron diffraction the electrons behave as if they are non-relativistic particles of mass formula_8 in terms of how they interact with the atoms.

The wavelength of the electrons formula_13 in vacuum is from the above equationsformula_14and can range from about , roughly the size of an atom, down to a thousandth of that. Typically the energy of the electrons is written in electronvolts (eV), the voltage used to accelerate the electrons; the actual energy of each electron is this voltage times the electron charge. For context, the typical energy of a chemical bond is a few eV; electron diffraction involves electrons up to .

The magnitude of the interaction of the electrons with a material scales asformula_15While the wavevector increases as the energy increases, the change in the effective mass compensates this so even at the very high energies used in electron diffraction there are still significant interactions.

The high-energy electrons interact with the Coulomb potential, which for a crystal can be considered in terms of a Fourier series (see for instance Ashcroft and Mermin), that isformula_16with formula_17 a reciprocal lattice vector and formula_18 the corresponding Fourier coefficient of the potential. The reciprocal lattice vector is often referred to in terms of Miller indices formula_19, a sum of the individual reciprocal lattice vectors formula_20 with integers formula_21 in the form:formula_22(Sometimes reciprocal lattice vectors are written as formula_23, formula_24, formula_25 and see note.) The contribution from the formula_18 needs to be combined with what is called the shape function (e.g.), which is the Fourier transform of the shape of the object. If, for instance, the object is small in one dimension then the shape function extends far in that direction in the Fourier transform—a reciprocal relationship.

Around each reciprocal lattice point one has this shape function. How much intensity there will be in the diffraction pattern depends upon the intersection of the Ewald sphere, that is energy conservation, and the shape function around each reciprocal lattice point—see Figure 6, 20 and 22. The vector from a reciprocal lattice point to the Ewald sphere is called the excitation error formula_27.

For transmission electron diffraction the samples used are thin, so most of the shape function is along the direction of the electron beam. For both LEED and RHEED the shape function is mainly normal to the surface of the sample. In LEED this results in (a simplification) back-reflection of the electrons leading to spots, see Figure 20 and 21 later, whereas in RHEED the electrons reflect off the surface at a small angle and typically yield diffraction patterns with streaks, see Figure 22 and 23 later. By comparison, with both x-ray and neutron diffraction the scattering is significantly weaker, so typically requires much larger crystals, in which case the shape function shrinks to just around the reciprocal lattice points, leading to simpler Bragg&#x27;s law diffraction.

For all cases, when the reciprocal lattice points are close to the Ewald sphere (the excitation error is small) the intensity tends to be higher; when they are far away it tends to be smaller. The set of diffraction spots at right angles to the direction of the incident beam are called the zero-order Laue zone (ZOLZ) spots, as shown in Figure 6. One can also have intensities further out from reciprocal lattice points which are in a higher layer. The first of these is called the first order Laue zone (FOLZ); the series is called by the generic name higher order Laue zone (HOLZ).

The result is that the electron wave after it has been diffracted can be written as an integral over different plane waves:formula_28that is a sum of plane waves going in different directions, each with a complex amplitude formula_29. (This is a three dimensional integral, which is often written as formula_30 rather than formula_31.) For a crystalline sample these wavevectors have to be of the same magnitude for elastic scattering (no change in energy), and are related to the incident direction formula_32 by (see Figure 6)
formula_33
A diffraction pattern detects the intensitiesformula_34For a crystal these will be near the reciprocal lattice points typically forming a two dimensional grid. Different samples and modes of diffraction give different results, as do different approximations for the amplitudes formula_29.

A typical electron diffraction pattern in TEM and LEED is a grid of high intensity spots (white) on a dark background, approximating a projection of the reciprocal lattice vectors, see Figure 1, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 21 later. There are also cases which will be mentioned later where diffraction patterns are not periodic, see Figure 15, have additional diffuse structure as in Figure 16, or have rings as in Figure 12, 13 and 24. With conical illumination as in CBED they can also be a grid of discs, see Figure 7, 9 and 18. RHEED is slightly different, see Figure 22, 23. If the excitation errors formula_36 were zero for every reciprocal lattice vector, this grid would be at exactly the spacings of the reciprocal lattice vectors. This would be equivalent to a Bragg&#x27;s law condition for all of them. In TEM the wavelength is small and this is close to correct, but not exact. In practice the deviation of the positions from a simple Bragg&#x27;s law interpretation is often neglected, particularly if a column approximation is made (see below).

=== Kinematical diffraction ===
In Kinematical theory an approximation is made that the electrons are only scattered once. For transmission electron diffraction it is common to assume a constant thickness formula_37, and also what is called the Column Approximation (e.g. references and further reading). For a perfect crystal the intensity for each diffraction spot formula_17 is then:formula_39where formula_40 is the magnitude of the excitation error formula_41 along z, the distance along the beam direction (z-axis by convention) from the diffraction spot to the Ewald sphere, and formula_42 is the structure factor:formula_43the sum being over all the atoms in the unit cell with formula_44 the form factors, formula_17 the reciprocal lattice vector, formula_46 is a simplified form of the Debye–Waller factor, and formula_3 is the wavevector for the diffraction beam which is:formula_48for an incident wavevector of formula_32, as in Figure 6 and above. The excitation error comes in as the outgoing wavevector formula_3 has to have the same modulus (i.e. energy) as the incoming wavevector formula_32. The intensity in transmission electron diffraction oscillates as a function of thickness, which can be confusing; there can similarly be intensity changes due to variations in orientation and also structural defects such as dislocations. If a diffraction spot is strong it could be because it has a larger structure factor, or it could be because the combination of thickness and excitation error is &quot;right&quot;. Similarly the observed intensity can be small, even though the structure factor is large. This can complicate interpretation of the intensities. By comparison, these effects are much smaller in x-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction because they interact with matter far less and often Bragg&#x27;s law is adequate.

This form is a reasonable first approximation which is qualitatively correct in many cases, but more accurate forms including multiple scattering (dynamical diffraction) of the electrons are needed to properly understand the intensities.

=== Dynamical diffraction ===

While kinematical diffraction is adequate to understand the geometry of the diffraction spots, it does not correctly give the intensities and has a number of other limitations. For a more complete approach one has to include multiple scattering of the electrons using methods that date back to the early work of Hans Bethe in 1928. These are based around solutions of the Schrödinger equation using the relativistic effective mass formula_8 described earlier. Even at very high energies dynamical diffraction is needed as the relativistic mass and wavelength partially cancel, so the role of the potential is larger than might be thought.
The main components of current dynamical diffraction of electrons include:
* Taking into account the scattering back into the incident beam both from diffracted beams and between all others, not just single scattering from the incident beam to diffracted beams. This is important even for samples which are only a few atoms thick.
* Modelling at least semi-empirically the role of inelastic scattering by an imaginary component of the potential, also called an &quot;optical potential&quot;. There is always inelastic scattering, and often it can have a major effect on both the background and sometimes the details, see Figure 7 and 18.
* Higher-order numerical approaches to calculate the intensities such as multislice, matrix methods which are called Bloch-wave approaches or muffin-tin approaches. With these diffraction spots which are not present in kinematical theory can be present, e.g.
* Contributions to the diffraction from elastic strain and crystallographic defects, and also what Jens Lindhard called the string potential.
* For transmission electron microscopes effects due to variations in the thickness of the sample and the normal to the surface. 
* Both in the geometry of scattering and calculations, for both LEED and RHEED, effects due to the presence of surface steps, surface reconstructions and other atoms at the surface. Often these change the diffraction details significantly. 
* For LEED, use more careful analyses of the potential because contributions from exchange terms can be important. Without these the calculations may not be accurate enough.

=== Kikuchi lines ===
Kikuchi lines, first observed by Seishi Kikuchi in 1928, are linear features created by electrons scattered both inelastically and elastically. As the electron beam interacts with matter, the electrons are diffracted via elastic scattering, and also scattered inelastically losing part of their energy. These occur simultaneously, and cannot be separated – according to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, only the probabilities of electrons at detectors can be measured. These electrons form Kikuchi lines which provide information on the orientation.

Kikuchi lines come in pairs forming Kikuchi bands, and are indexed in terms of the crystallographic planes they are connected to, with the angular width of the band equal to the magnitude of the corresponding diffraction vector formula_53. The position of Kikuchi bands is fixed with respect to each other and the orientation of the sample, but not against the diffraction spots or the direction of the incident electron beam. As the crystal is tilted, the bands move on the diffraction pattern. Since the position of Kikuchi bands is quite sensitive to crystal orientation, they can be used to fine-tune a zone-axis orientation or determine crystal orientation. They can also be used for navigation when changing the orientation between zone axes connected by some band, an example of such a map produced by combining many local sets of experimental Kikuchi patterns is in Figure 8; Kikuchi maps are available for many materials.

== Types and techniques ==
=== In a transmission electron microscope ===
Electron diffraction in a TEM exploits controlled electron beams using electron optics. Different types of diffraction experiments, for instance Figure 9, provide information such as lattice constants, symmetries, and sometimes to solve an unknown crystal structure.

It is common to combine it with other methods, for instance images using selected diffraction beams, high-resolution images showing the atomic structure, chemical analysis through energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, investigations of electronic structure and bonding through electron energy loss spectroscopy, and studies of the electrostatic potential through electron holography; this list is not exhaustive. Compared to x-ray crystallography, TEM analysis is significantly more localized and can be used to obtain information from tens of thousands of atoms to just a few or even single atoms.

==== Formation of a diffraction pattern ====

In TEM, the electron beam passes through a thin film of the material as illustrated in Figure 10. Before and after the sample the beam is manipulated by the electron optics including magnetic lenses, deflectors and apertures; these act on the electrons similar to how glass lenses focus and control light. Optical elements above the sample are used to control the incident beam which can range from a wide and parallel beam to one which is a converging cone and can be smaller than an atom, 0.1 nm. As it interacts with the sample, part of the beam is diffracted and part is transmitted without changing its direction. This occurs simultaneously as electrons are everywhere until they are detected (wavefunction collapse) according to the Copenhagen interpretation.

Below the sample, the beam is controlled by another set of magnetic lneses and apertures. Each set of initially parallel rays (a plane wave) is focused by the first lens (objective) to a point in the back focal plane of this lens, forming a spot on a detector; a map of these directions, often an array of spots, is the diffraction pattern. Alternatively the lenses can form a magnified image of the sample. Herein the focus is on collecting a diffraction pattern; for other information see the pages on TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy.

==== Selected area electron diffraction ====

The simplest diffraction technique in TEM is selected area electron diffraction (SAED) where the incident beam is wide and close to parallel. An aperture is used to select a particular region of interest from which the diffraction is collected. These apertures are part of a thin foil of a heavy metal such as tungsten which has a number of small holes in it. This way diffraction information can be limited to, for instance, individual crystallites. Unfortunately the method is limited by the spherical aberration of the objective lens, so is only accurate for large grains with tens of thousands of atoms or more; for smaller regions a focused probe is needed.

If a parallel beam is used to acquire a diffraction pattern from a single-crystal, the result is similar to a two-dimensional projection of the crystal reciprocal lattice. From this one can determine interplanar distances and angles and in some cases crystal symmetry, particularly when the electron beam is down a major zone axis, see for instance the database by Jean-Paul Morniroli. However, projector lens aberrations such as barrel distortion as well as dynamical diffraction effects (e.g.) cannot be ignored. For instance, certain diffraction spots which are not present in x-ray diffraction can appear, for instance those due to Gjønnes-Moodie extinction conditions. 

If the sample is tilted relative to the electron beam, different sets of crystallographic planes contribute to the pattern yielding different types of diffraction patterns, approximately different projections of the reciprocal lattice, see Figure 11. This can be used to determine the crystal orientation, which in turn can be used to set the orientation needed for a particular experiment. Furthermore, a series of diffraction patterns varying in tilt can be acquired and processed using a diffraction tomography approach. There are ways to combine this with direct methods algorithms using electrons and other methods such as charge flipping, or automated diffraction tomography to solve crystal structures.

==== Polycrystalline pattern ====
Diffraction patterns depend on whether the beam is diffracted by one single crystal or by a number of differently oriented crystallites, for instance in a polycrystalline material. If there are many contributing crystallites, the diffraction image is a superposition of individual crystal patterns, see Figure 12. With a large number of grains this superposition yields diffraction spots of all possible reciprocal lattice vectors. This results in a pattern of concentric rings as shown in Figure 12 and 13.

Textured materials yield a non-uniform distribution of intensity around the ring, which can be used to discriminate between nanocrystalline and amorphous phases. However, diffraction often cannot differentiate between very small grain polycrystalline materials and truly random order amorphous. Here high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and fluctuation electron microscopy can be more powerful, although this is still a topic of continuing development.

==== Multiple materials and double diffraction ====
In simple cases there is only one grain or one type of material in the area used for collecting a diffraction pattern. However, often there is more than one. If they are in different areas then the diffraction pattern will be a combination. In addition there can be one grain on top of another, in which case the electrons that go through the first are diffracted by the second. Electrons have no memory (like many of us), so after they have gone through the first grain and been diffracted, they traverse the second as if their current direction was that of the incident beam. This leads to diffraction spots which are the vector sum of those of the two (or even more) reciprocal lattices of the crystals, and can lead to complicated results. It can be difficult to know if this is real and due to some novel material, or just a case where multiple crystals and diffraction is leading to odd results.

==== Bulk and surface superstructures ====
Many materials have relatively simple structures based upon small unit cell vectors formula_54 (see also note). There are many others where the repeat is some larger multiple of the smaller unit cell (subcell) along one or more direction, for instance formula_55. which has larger dimensions in two directions. These superstructures can arise from many reasons:
# Larger unit cells due to electronic ordering which leads to small displacements of the atoms in the subcell. One example is antiferroelectricity ordering.
# Chemical ordering, that is different atom types at different locations of the subcell.
# Magnetic order of the spins. These may be in opposite directions on some atoms, leading to what is called antiferromagnetism.
In addition to those which occur in the bulk, superstructures can also occur at surfaces. When half the material is (nominally) removed to create a surface, some of the atoms will be under coordinated. To reduce their energy they can rearrange. Sometimes these rearrangements are relatively small; sometimes they are quite large. Similar to a bulk superstructure there will be additional, weaker diffraction spots. One example is for the silicon (111) surface, where there is a supercell which is seven times larger than the simple bulk cell in two directions. This leads to diffraction patterns with additional spots some of which are marked in Figure 14. Here the (220) are stronger bulk diffraction spots, and the weaker ones due to the surface reconstruction are marked 7 × 7—see note for convention comments.

==== Aperiodic materials ====

In an aperiodic crystal the structure can no longer be simply described by three different vectors in real or reciprocal space. In general there is a substructure describable by three (e.g. formula_56), similar to supercells above, but in addition there is some additional periodicity (one to three) which cannot be described as a multiple of the three; it is a genuine additional periodicity which is an irrational number relative to the subcell lattice. The diffraction pattern can then only be described by more than three indices.

An extreme example of this is for quasicrystals, which can be described similarly by a higher number of Miller indices in reciprocal space—but not by any translational symmetry in real space. An example of this is shown in Figure 15 for an Al–Cu–Fe–Cr decagonal quasicrystal grown by magnetron sputtering on a sodium chloride substrate and then lifted off by dissolving the substrate with water. In the pattern there are pentagons which are a characteristic of the aperiodic nature of these materials.

==== Diffuse scattering ====

A further step beyond superstructures and aperiodic materials is what is called &quot;diffuse scattering&quot; in electron diffraction patterns due to disorder, which is also known for x-ray or neutron scattering. This can occur from inelastic processes, for instance, in bulk silicon the atomic vibrations (phonons) are more prevalent along specific directions, which leads to streaks in diffraction patterns. Sometimes it is due to arrangements of point defects. Completely disordered substitutional point defects lead to a general background which is called &quot;Laue monotonic scattering.&quot; Often there is a probability distribution for the distances between point defects or what type of substitutional atom there is, which leads to distinct three-dimensional intensity features in diffraction patterns. An example of this is for a Nb0.83CoSb sample, with the diffraction pattern shown in Figure 16. Because of the vacancies at the niobium sites, there is diffuse intensity with snake-like structure due to correlations of the distances between vacancies and also the relaxation of Co and Sb atoms around these vacancies.

==== Convergent beam electron diffraction ====
In convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED), the incident electrons are normally focused in a converging cone-shaped beam with a crossover located at the sample, e.g. Figure 17, although other methods exist. Unlike the parallel beam, the convergent beam is able to carry information from the sample volume, not just a two-dimensional projection available in SAED. With convergent beam there is also no need for the selected area aperture, as it is inherently site-selective since the beam crossover is positioned at the object plane where the sample is located.

A CBED pattern consists of disks arranged similar to the spots in SAED. Intensity within the disks represents dynamical diffraction effects and symmetries of the sample structure, see Figure 7 and 18. Even though the zone axis and lattice parameter analysis based on disk positions does not significantly differ from SAED, the analysis of disks content is more complex and simulations based on dynamical diffraction theory is often required. As illustrated in Figure 18, the details within the disk change with sample thickness, as does the inelastic background. With appropriate analysis CBED patterns can be used for indexation of the crystal point group, space group identification, measurement of lattice parameters, thickness or strain.

The disk diameter can be controlled using the microscope optics and apertures. The larger is the angle, the broader the disks are with more features. If the angle is increased to significantly, the disks begin to overlap. This is avoided in large angle convergent electron beam diffraction (LACBED) where the sample is moved upwards or downwards. There are applications, however, where the overlapping disks are beneficial, for instance with a ronchigram. It is a CBED pattern, often but not always of an amorphous material, with many intentionally overlapping disks providing information about the optical aberrations of the electron optical system.

==== Precession electron diffraction ====
Precession electron diffraction (PED), invented by Roger Vincent and Paul Midgley in 1994, is a method to collect electron diffraction patterns in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The technique involves rotating (precessing) a tilted incident electron beam around the central axis of the microscope, compensating for the tilt after the sample so a spot diffraction pattern is formed, similar to a SAED pattern. However, a PED pattern is an integration over a collection of diffraction conditions, see Figure 19. This integration produces a quasi-kinematical diffraction pattern that is more suitable as input into direct methods algorithms using electrons to determine the crystal structure of the sample. Because it avoids many dynamical effects it can also be used to better identify crystallographic phases.

==== 4D STEM ====

4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM) is a subset of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) methods which uses a pixelated electron detector to capture a convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern at each scan location; see the main page for further information. This technique captures a 2 dimensional reciprocal space image associated with each scan point as the beam rasters across a 2 dimensional region in real space, hence the name 4D STEM. Its development was enabled by better STEM detectors and improvements in computational power. The technique has applications in diffraction contrast imaging, phase orientation and identification, strain mapping, and atomic resolution imaging among others; it has become very popular and rapidly evolving from about 2020 onwards.

The name 4D STEM is common in literature, however it is known by other names: 4D STEM EELS, ND STEM (N- since the number of dimensions could be higher than 4), position resolved diffraction (PRD), spatial resolved diffractometry, momentum-resolved STEM, &quot;nanobeam precision electron diffraction&quot;, scanning electron nano diffraction, nanobeam electron diffraction, or pixelated STEM. Most of these are the same, although there are instances such as momentum-resolved STEM where the emphasis can be very different.

=== Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) ===

Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a technique for the determination of the surface structure of single-crystalline materials by bombardment with a collimated beam of low-energy electrons (30–200 eV). In this case the Ewald sphere leads to approximately back-reflection, as illustrated in Figure 20, and diffracted electrons as spots on a fluorescent screen as shown in Figure 21; see the main page for more information and references. It has been used to solve a very large number of relatively simple surface structures of metals and semiconductors, plus cases with simple chemisorbants. For more complex cases transmission electron diffraction or surface x-ray diffraction have been used, often combined with scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations.

LEED may be used in one of two ways:
# Qualitatively, where the diffraction pattern is recorded and analysis of the spot positions gives information on the symmetry of the surface structure. In the presence of an adsorbate the qualitative analysis may reveal information about the size and rotational alignment of the adsorbate unit cell with respect to the substrate unit cell.
# Quantitatively, where the intensities of diffracted beams are recorded as a function of incident electron beam energy to generate the so-called I–V curves. By comparison with theoretical curves, these may provide accurate information on atomic positions on the surface.

=== Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) ===

Reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), is a technique used to characterize the surface of crystalline materials by reflecting electrons off a surface. As illustrated for the Ewald sphere construction in Figure 22, it uses mainly the higher-order Laue zones which have a reflection component. An experimental diffraction pattern is shown in Figure 23 and shows both rings from the higher-order Laue zones and streaky spots. RHEED systems gather information only from the surface layers of the sample, which distinguishes RHEED from other materials characterization methods that also rely on diffraction of electrons. Transmission electron microscopy samples mainly the bulk of the sample, although in special cases it can provide surface information. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is also surface sensitive, and achieves surface sensitivity through the use of low energy electrons. The main uses of RHEED to date have been during thin film growth, as the geometry is amenable to simultaneous collection of the diffraction data and deposition. It can, for instance, be used to monitor surface roughness during growth by looking at both the shapes of the streaks in the diffraction pattern as well as variations in the intensities.

=== Gas electron diffraction ===

Gas electron diffraction (GED) can be used to determine the geometry of molecules in gases. A gas carrying the molecules is exposed to the electron beam, which is diffracted by the molecules. Since the molecules are randomly oriented, the resulting diffraction pattern consists of broad concentric rings, see Figure 24. The diffraction intensity is a sum of several components such as background, atomic intensity or molecular intensity.

In GED the diffraction intensities at a particular diffraction angle formula_57 is described via a scattering variable defined asformula_58The total intensity is then given as a sum of partial contributions:formula_59where formula_60 results from scattering by individual atoms, formula_61 by pairs of atoms and formula_62 by atom triplets. Intensity formula_63 corresponds to the background which, unlike the previous contributions, must be determined experimentally. The intensity of atomic scattering formula_60 is defined asformula_65where formula_66, formula_67 is the distance between the scattering object detector, formula_68 is the intensity of the primary electron beam and formula_69 is the scattering amplitude of the atom formula_70 of the molecular structure in the experiment. formula_60 is the main contribution and easily obtained for known gas composition. Note that the vector formula_72 used here is not the same as the excitation error used in other areas of diffraction, see earlier.

The most valuable information is carried by the intensity of molecular scattering formula_60, as it contains information about the distance between all pairs of atoms in the molecule. It is given byformula_74where formula_75 is the distance between two atoms, formula_76 is the mean square amplitude of vibration between the two atoms, similar to a Debye–Waller factor, formula_77 is the anharmonicity constant and formula_78 a phase factor which is important for atomic pairs with very different nuclear charges. The summation is performed over all atom pairs. Atomic triplet intensity formula_62 is negligible in most cases. If the molecular intensity is extracted from an experimental pattern by subtracting other contributions, it can be used to match and refine a structural model against the experimental data.

Similar methods of analysis have also been applied to analyze electron diffraction data from liquids.

=== In a scanning electron microscope ===

In a scanning electron microscope the region near the surface can be mapped using an electron beam that is scanned in a grid across the sample. A diffraction pattern can be recorded using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), as illustrated in Figure 25, captured with a camera inside the microscope. A depth from a few nanometers to a few microns, depending upon the electron energy used, is penetrated by the electrons, some of which are diffracted backwards and out of the sample. As result of combined inelastic and elastic scattering, typical features in an EBSD image are Kikuchi lines. Since the position of Kikuchi bands is highly sensitive to the crystal orientation, EBSD data can be used to determine the crystal orientation at particular locations of the sample. The data are processed by software yielding two-dimensional orientation maps. As the Kikuchi lines carry information about the interplanar angles and distances and, therefore, about the crystal structure, they can also be used for phase identification or strain analysis.

<doc id="277706" wikidata="Q3518013" url="?curid=277706" title="N. Chandrababu Naidu">
<text>Nara Chandrababu Naidu (; born 20 April 1950), commonly known as CBN, is an Indian politician who is currently serving as the 13th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He holds the record of longest-serving Chief Minister in the political history of Telugu states. He is the national president of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

In 1978, he was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Indian National Congress party, and from 1980 to 1982, he served as a minister in the state cabinet. Afterwards, he switched party allegiance and joined TDP, which had been founded by his father-in-law N. T. Rama Rao. Naidu served as a TDP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1989 to 1995. In 1995, he became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

During his two previous terms as Chief Minister, Naidu&#x27;s public image was that of an economic reformer and proponent of information technology-based economic growth. His policies brought modernisation and investments particularly to Hyderabad, where he directed the founding of HITEC City. He also had a role in national politics, first as the convener of the United Front in 1996. He supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, in which TDP won 29 seats, enhancing Naidu&#x27;s reputation as a nationally prominent politician. In 2014, Naidu returned as Chief Minister, winning in the now-residuary (due to bifurcation) Andhra Pradesh.

In the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, Naidu&#x27;s party faced an electoral setback, with TDP winning only 23 out of 175 seats. In September 2023, Naidu was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) police in Andhra Pradesh due to alleged involvement in the skills development case and was granted bail by Andhra Pradesh High Court in November 2023. In the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, the TDP returned to power once again in a landslide topling the incumbent YSRCP government and Naidu became Chief Minister for the fourth time.

== Early life and education ==
Naidu was born on 20 April 1950 in a Telugu agrarian family to Nara Kharjura Naidu and his mother Amanamma in Naravaripalle, Tirupati district, in present-day Andhra Pradesh. He has a younger brother Nara Ramamurthy Naidu and two younger sisters. Naidu has vitiligo, an autoimmune disease that causes white patches on the skin.

Since his village had no school, Naidu attended primary school in Seshapuram up to class five and the Chandragiri Government High School up to class 10. He completed his B.A. degree in 1972 from Sri Venkateswara Arts College, Tirupati. Later, he got his master&#x27;s degree in economics from Sri Venkateswara University. In 1974, under the guidance of professor Dr. D. L. Narayana he started work on his Ph.D. on the topic of &quot;Economic ideas of Professor N. G. Ranga,&quot; but did not complete his Ph.D.

== Political career ==
=== Indian National Congress ===
Naidu started his political activities as a student union leader in Sri Venkateswara University while pursuing his master&#x27;s degree. In 1975, he joined Indian Youth Congress and became the president of its local chapter in Pulicherla. After the emergency was imposed on the country in 1975, he became a supporter of Sanjay Gandhi.

With the help of N. G. Ranga, Naidu secured a candidacy from the Congress party, under its 20% quota for the youth, and became a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the Chandragiri constituency in the 1978 assembly elections. He initially served as a director of Andhra Pradesh Small Scale Industries Development Corporation. Later, he was appointed as a minister in T. Anjaiah&#x27;s government. Between 1980 and 1983, Naidu held various portfolios, including archives, cinematography, technical education, and minor irrigation in the state government. He became the youngest MLA at the age of 28 and a minister at the age of 30 in Andhra Pradesh at that time.

As the cinematography minister, Naidu came in contact with N. T. Rama Rao, a popular film star in Telugu cinema. In September 1981, he married Bhuvaneswari, Rao&#x27;s second daughter.

=== Telugu Desam Party ===

In 1982, N. T. Rama Rao, formed the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and swept the Andhra Pradesh assembly polls held in 1983. Chandrababu Naidu, who was his son-in-law, remained in the Congress Party. However, he was defeated by a TDP candidate in the elections from Chandragiri assembly constituency. Soon after, he joined the Telugu Desam Party. Initially, Naidu involved himself in the party work, organising training camps and computerising membership records. He played an active role during the 1984 August crisis in the government triggered by Nadendla Bhaskara Rao&#x27;s coup. NTR appointed Naidu as general secretary of the TDP in 1986.

=== Legislative career (1989–1994) ===
In the 1989 assembly election, Naidu contested from Kuppam constituency as a TDP candidate and won by 5,000 votes. INC, however, was elected to power, so Naidu was in the opposition. Rama Rao appointed him as a coordinator of the TDP, in which capacity he handled the party&#x27;s role of the main opposition in the assembly which won him wide appreciation from both the party and the public. His role during this phase, both inside the Legislative Assembly and outside, is seen as a critical factor for the subsequent success of the party.

Naidu won the 1994 elections from Kuppam constituency. He became the Finance and Revenue Minister in N. T. Rama Rao&#x27;s ministry.

=== First term as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (1995–1999) ===

On 1 September 1995, Naidu, at the age of 45, was sworn in as the Chief Minister following a successful coup against the leadership of N.T. Rama Rao. The internal rebellion was triggered by the controversial role of Lakshmi Parvathi, NTR&#x27;s second wife, in the party and the government. Naidu was able to secure the support of the majority of the legislators and has hence served as the leader of the party.

=== Second term as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (1999–2004) ===

In the 1999 state legislature elections, Chandrababu Naidu led his party to victory, securing 180 out of 294 seats in the state assembly. Additionally, the TDP won 29 out of 42 seats in the Parliament elections. The TDP&#x27;s tally in the Lok Sabha made it not only the biggest of the BJP&#x27;s allies, but also the fourth largest party in the Lok Sabha. These elections marked a critical juncture for Naidu, as they served as a significant test of his legitimacy both as the Chief Minister of the state and as the President of the TDP. Upon his return to power, the media hailed him as the first economic reformer to secure a strong electoral mandate.

=== Assassination attempt ===
On 1 October 2003, Naidu survived a land mine blast by the People&#x27;s War Group (PWG) near Alipiri tollgate in Tirupati. The Chief Minister&#x27;s convoy was attacked on his way to Tirumala to participate in the annual ritual of Brahmotsavam of Lord Venkateswara atop the seven hills. A total of 17 Claymore mines were planted, of which 9 exploded. Naidu was the first Chief Minister in the country to have been targeted by the ultra-left-wing Naxalites for assassination. Naidu&#x27;s escape with minor injuries was considered miraculous given the severity of the blast. The PWG claimed it attacked him for being a &quot;World Bank agent.&quot;

=== Role in National Politics ===
Chandrababu Naidu&#x27;s involvement in national politics during the period of 1996 to 2004 was dominated by non-Congress coalition politics in Delhi. In the aftermath of the 1996 parliamentary elections, he assumed the role of convenor for the United Front, a coalition comprising 13 political parties that secured power at the Centre. The coalition government was headed by H.D. Deve Gowda and later I.K. Gujral between 1996 and 1998. The United Front had its headquarters at Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in New Delhi.

Subsequently, Chandrababu Naidu&#x27;s significance in national affairs got amplified after the 1999 Lok Sabha elections. The TDP and the BJP, which had a pre-poll understanding in the state, together won 36 MPs out of 42. The BJP emerged as the largest single party in the Lok Sabha. The TDP extended the support of 29 of its MPs to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government headed by A. B. Vajpayee. TDP did not join the government, extending only &#x27;issue-based support&#x27;. Naidu claimed that though Vajpayee had offered eight cabinet berths to his party, the TDP stayed away from the union cabinet and offered external support to the NDA government.

=== Leader of the Opposition (2004–2014) ===

Naidu, soon after the assassination attempt on him, dissolved the state assembly. Elections to the state were held along with the parliamentary polls in April 2004. The TDP government faced anti-incumbency fuelled by high power tariffs and the absence of support to the agricultural sector. Besides, the newly formed Congress(I)-TRS alliance posed a major challenge to the TDP popularity in Telangana. The Telugu Desam Party was defeated in both the state and Lok Sabha elections. The Congress Party won 185 seats while the TDP ended up with 47 seats in the assembly, the then lowest in the party&#x27;s electoral history. The TDP won only 5 seats out of 42 in Parliament. Naidu felt that the severe drought that gripped Andhra Pradesh the previous year as well as advancing the timing of the election were the major reasons for his defeat.

In the 2009 assembly and parliamentary elections, Naidu faced another challenge as popular actor Chiranjeevi formed Praja Rajyam party and turned the election into a three-cornered contest. The TDP, which formed an alliance with TRS this time, once again lost to the incumbent Congress Party. The TDP secured 92 seats in the assembly, whereas the Congress got 156 seats, a thin majority in the assembly. Chiranjeevi&#x27;s Praja Rajyam won in 18 seats. Naidu blamed Chiranjeevi&#x27;s entry into the political arena for his party&#x27;s debacle.

=== Third term as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (2014–2019) ===

After the bifurcation, elections were held in 2014 in the newly formed states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Naidu formed an alliance again with the BJP and Jana Sena Party and returned to power in the bifurcated, residual Andhra Pradesh state, winning 102 seats out of 175 seats. The TDP also won 16 Lok Sabha seats. Naidu took oath as the first Chief Minister of the residuary state of Andhra Pradesh at Mangalagiri on the grounds of Acharya Nagarjuna University near Guntur. His party joined the NDA government at the Centre and held two portfolios in the union cabinet. Two cabinet berths in the state were allocated to the BJP.

The Chief Minister faced a host of challenges in the new state. The newly born state of Andhra Pradesh was left without a capital city and was deprived of a major economic hub. Naidu took up the construction of a new capital city, named Amaravati, on the southern side of river Krishna near Vijayawada. During Naidu&#x27;s term, the state achieved top ranking in the World Bank&#x27;s Ease of Business rankings in the country since 2015. The state attracted mega companies like Kia Motors, Isuzu Motors, Pepsi, Mondelez and Foxconn.

==== 2015 cash-for-vote scam ====

Naidu&#x27;s name figured in the cash-for-vote scandal which pertains to the alleged role of the TDP to buy votes in the 2015 Telangana Legislative Council elections. It started off when the TDP leaders of Telangana state were caught on video footage, aired in the media, allegedly offering bribes to a nominated MLA, Elvis Stephenson, for his vote in the 2015 Council elections. Telangana Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) claimed that it was in possession of a recorded telephonic conversation that purportedly took place between Elvis Stephenson and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu, who was the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister. Both the TRS (now BRS) and YSR Congress Party demanded that Naidu should be named in the case. However, the ACB and later the Enforcement Directorate (ED), in their charge sheets, did not name Naidu as an accused in the case, as they did not find evidence to prove that the money was sent to Stevenson at the behest of Naidu.

==== Special status dispute and break with BJP ====
In March 2018, the TDP withdrew its two ministers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s government over the issue of Andhra special category status (SCS). The SCS had been promised by the previous Congress government on the floor of the Parliament during the passage of the AP Reorganisation Bill. Subsequently, Naidu announced the TDP&#x27;s departure from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) due to the &quot;injustice&quot; inflicted upon Andhra Pradesh by the denial of SCS.

In 2016, Naidu had previously agreed to the announcement made by the then Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley regarding a financial package for Andhra Pradesh instead of granting it special status. In this backdrop, the decision of the ruling TDP to withdraw from the NDA was perceived as a political response to the mounting criticism from the Opposition regarding the non-fulfilment of the special category status. Naidu further criticised the central government on the issue by staging a hunger strike, known as &#x27;Dharma Porata Deeksha&#x27; (a day-long &#x27;protest for justice&#x27;), in Delhi. This event marked a significant deterioration in the relationship between the TDP and the BJP.

As of February 2018, It was reported by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) that he was the richest Chief Minister in India, with total assets of 177 crore.

==== Alliance with the Congress Party ====

In an unexpected turn of events, the TDP forged an alliance with the Congress Party for the 2018 Telangana assembly elections. The alliance, consisting of the Congress, the TDP, and the Communist Party of India (CPI), formed the &quot;Maha Kootami&quot; (grand alliance) with the primary objective of defeating the TRS (now BRS) in the elections. This marked the first time that the TDP, which had been founded on an anti-Congress platform in 1982, joined hands with the Congress party. During this period, Naidu was advocating for a non-BJP coalition comprising regional parties with the support of Congress to make a significant impact in the upcoming parliamentary elections. This experiment faced a failure in the Telangana elections with K.Chandrashekar Rao&#x27;s TRS winning by a big margin. As a result, the TDP and the Congress subsequently parted ways for the 2019 Andhra Pradesh assembly elections. The alliance with the Congress and its aftermath left a bitter outcome for Naidu, leading to a considerable erosion of his credibility due to the perceived flip-flop in alliances.
=== 2019 elections ===
In the 2019 assembly and parliamentary elections, the ruling TDP was decisively defeated by the YSR Congress Party led by Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The YSRCP achieved a landslide victory by securing 151 seats in the assembly out of 175, while the TDP could manage 23 seats. In the Lok Sabha, the TDP won three seats, while the YSRCP secured the remaining 22 seats.

=== Corruption allegations and arrest ===
On 9 September 2023, Naidu was arrested by the Andhra Pradesh Crime Investigation Department (AP-CID), accused of misappropriation of public funds amounting to 371 crore INR. He was listed as accused number 37 in the case. On 10 September 2023, he appeared at the ACB court and the court remanded him in custody for 14 days, for which he was moved to the Central Jail in Rajamahendravaram. After being in judicial custody for 52 days, he was released on bail on 31 October 2023.

=== Fourth term as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (2024–present) ===

Naidu was sworn in as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh for a record fourth term, surpassing N. T. Rama Rao who had served as the chief minister of the state for three terms, on 12 June 2024 after the TDP in alliance with the BJP and the JSP won the 2024 state legislative assembly election in a landslide, garnering 164 out of 175 seats and defeating the YSR Congress Party led by Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

He has vowed to revive Amaravati as the sole capital of Andhra Pradesh and said that he will rebuild the capital as soon as possible. Mr. Naidu said he would seek the Central government’s cooperation to rebuild Amaravati and exuded confidence that the expected support would come. The Centre had provided capital gains exemption for all sales of land and released ₹1,500 crore of the approved ₹2,500 crore for Amaravati.

As of December 2024, it was reported by the Association for Democratic Reforms that he was the richest Chief Minister in India, with total assets of 932 crore.

== Business career ==
Heritage Foods Limited (HFL), a dairy enterprise, was incorporated by Naidu in 1992. The company went public in 1994. The annual turnover of Heritage Foods stood at INR 26,429 million in the financial year 2021–22. Currently, Nara Bhuvaneswari, Naidu&#x27;s wife, holds the position of vice-chairperson &amp; managing director, while Nara Brahmani, Naidu&#x27;s daughter-in-law, serves as the executive director. Heritage has hundreds of outlets throughout Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and a significant presence across many states in the country. Heritage has also a renewable energy vertical which runs captive solar &amp; wind power plants at 11 different locations. HFL comprises a solid portion of Naidu&#x27;s current assets.

== Non-political initiatives ==
=== Global Forum for Sustainable Transformation ===

Chandrababu Naidu serves as the chairman and director of the Global Forum for Sustainable Transformation (GFST), an organisation he established in March 2020 in Hyderabad. It is positioned as a global not-for-profit and apolitical think tank, with the aim of promoting sustainability in economies and communities. In June 2023, GFST hosted a seminar on &#x27;Deep Technologies&#x27; in Hyderabad. Among its projects is the development of Vision India@2047, aligning with India&#x27;s 100th year of Independence. Naidu unveiled a vision document titled India@2047, authored by GFST, on 15 August 2023, in Visakhapatnam.

=== NTR Trust ===
The NTR Memorial Trust was founded in 1997 by Chandrababu Naidu as a non-profit organisation. The Trust is involved in a variety of activities including initiatives like providing free education, offering blood transfusion facilities, conducting health camps, and supporting empowerment and livelihood programs. The Trust manages a blood bank and Thalassemia center in Hyderabad, as well as blood banks in Visakhapatnam and Tirupati. Additionally, it operates schools in Hyderabad and Challapalli (Krishna district), along with NTR Junior &amp; Degree College for Women in Hyderabad. The Trust&#x27;s day-to-day operations are overseen by Naidu&#x27;s wife, Nara Bhuvaneswari, who serves as the managing trustee.

=== Criticism ===
Naidu faced severe criticism from various quarters for his policies. Both the Congress and left parties vehemently opposed his privatisation initiatives, labelling him as a symbol of World Bank policies. The power sector reforms implemented by him encountered strong resistance throughout the state. Naidu attracted criticism for allegedly prioritising information technology over the agriculture sector, which was a vital source of livelihood for a significant portion of the state&#x27;s workforce. While the corporate industry hailed him as the &quot;CEO of Andhra Pradesh Inc.,&quot; a substantial portion of the state&#x27;s population perceived him as &quot;anti-poor&quot;, which reflected in the loss of the 2004 elections. Amaravati, the new capital city that he set out to build in his latest term, ran into rough weather over various controversies.

== Public image ==
Chandrababu Naidu was one of the most recognised Chief Ministers in the country during his nine-and-a-half-year tenure from 1995 to 2004. He was a strong supporter of liberalisation policies at the state level. The western media hailed him as &quot;one of the most promising local leaders not just in India but in the developing world.&quot; Andhra Pradesh was the first state in India to receive a direct World Bank loan for economic restructuring. Naidu was a regular participant at World Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland.

He is credited with commissioning HITEC City, and Genome Valley in 1998 by the erstwhile combined Government of Andhra Pradesh, adjoining Cyberabad to the west of Hyderabad, propelling the information technology industry and enhancing modern infrastructure in Hyderabad, including the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport and the Indian School of Business (ISB). Naidu&#x27;s meetings with Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, in New Delhi in 1997, followed by Gates&#x27; visit to Hyderabad in 2002, and the visit of US President Bill Clinton in 2000, played a significant role in enhancing his reputation.

During his third term between 2014 and 2019, Naidu took up the ambitious project of building a capital city Amaravati for the bifurcated state. Andhra Pradesh also became the number one state in Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Rankings during this period.

Naidu chaired the National IT Panel under the National Democratic Alliance (India) (NDA) government and was described as one of the &quot;hidden seven&quot; working wonders of the world by &quot;Profit&quot; (Oracle Corporation&#x27;s monthly magazine).

<text>Vitellaria paradoxa (formerly &quot;Butyrospermum parkii&quot;), commonly known as shea tree, shi tree (, also ), or vitellaria, is a tree of the family Sapotaceae. It is the only species in the genus Vitellaria, and is indigenous to Africa.

The shea fruit consists of a thin, tart, nutritious pulp that surrounds a relatively large, oil-rich seed from which shea butter is extracted. It is a deciduous tree usually tall, but has reached and a trunk diameter of .

The shea tree is a traditional African food plant. It has been claimed to have potential to improve nutrition, boost food supply in the &quot;annual hungry season&quot;, foster rural development, and support sustainable land care.

==Description==
The tree starts bearing its first fruit when it is 10 to 15 years old; full production is attained when the tree is about 20 to 30 years old. It then produces nuts for up to 200 years.

The fruits resemble large plums 4 to 8 centimetres long weighing between 10 and 57 grams each. These fruits take 4 to 6 months to ripen; the average yield is of fresh fruit per tree, with optimum yields up to . Each kilogram of fruit gives approximately of dry seeds. The fruit is edible.

==Nomenclature and taxonomy==
&quot;Vitellaria&quot; is a monotypic genus, i.e., it comprises only one species.  The species has variously been known botanically as &quot;Vitellaria paradoxa&quot;, &quot;Butyrospermum parkii&quot;, and &quot;Butyrospermum paradoxum&quot;.  Many botanical works from the late 19th and much of the 20th centuries used the name &quot;Butyrospermum parkii&quot;, which is still commonly found in the cosmetics trade.  However, &quot;Vitellaria paradoxa&quot; is the oldest name (published in 1807) and has been generally used in recent decades, as necessitated by the rules of botanical nomenclature; efforts in 1962 to make &quot;Butyrospermum&quot; the official scientific name for the genus (i.e., to &quot;conserve&quot; the name) were unsuccessful. 

The species comprises two subspecies: 

&quot;Vitellaria paradoxa&quot; subsp. &quot;paradoxa&quot;  (roughly from the Nigeria-Cameroon border westward).

&quot;Vitellaria paradoxa&quot; subsp. &quot;nilotica&quot; (Kotschy) A.N. Henry &amp; Chithra &amp; N.C. Nair (roughly from the Nigeria-Cameroon border eastward).

==Distribution and habitat==
The shea tree grows naturally in the wild in the dry savannah belt of West and South from Senegal in the west to Sudan and South Sudan in the east, and onto the foothills of the Ethiopian highlands. It occurs in 19 countries across the African continent, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Guinea. The habitat area extends over more than .

A testa found at the site of the medieval village of Saouga is evidence of shea butter production by the 14th century.

==Uses==
Shea butter has many uses and may or may not be refined. In the West it is most commonly used as an emollient in cosmetics and is less commonly used in food. Throughout Africa it is used extensively for food, is a major source of dietary fat, and for medicinal purposes. In Ghana and Nigeria, shea butter is a major ingredient for making the African black soap.
The edible protein-rich caterpillars of the moth &quot;Cirina butyrospermi&quot; which feed solely on its leaves are widely collected and eaten raw, dried or fried.

===Composition of shea butter===
Shea butter extract is a complex fat that in addition to many nonsaponifiable components (substances that cannot be fully converted into soap by treatment with alkali) contains the following fatty acids: oleic acid (40–60%), stearic acid (20–50%), linoleic acid (3–11%), palmitic acid (2–9%), linolenic acid (&lt;1%) and arachidic acid (&lt;1%).

==Etymology==
The common name is &quot;shíyiri&quot; (in N&#x27;Ko: ) or &quot;shísu&quot; (, lit. &quot;shea tree&quot;) in the Bambara language of Mali. This is the origin of the English word, whose primary pronunciation is (rhyming with &quot;tea&quot;), although the pronunciation (rhyming with &quot;day&quot;) is common and is listed second in major dictionaries. The tree is called &quot;ghariti&quot; in the Wolof language of Senegal, which is the origin of the French name of the tree and the butter, &quot;karité&quot;.

In Hausa language the tree is called &quot;Kaɗe&quot; or &quot;Kaɗanya&quot;. Indeed, the shea tree is so indispensable in Mole-Dagbang culinary and ethno-botanical practices that the Northern Ghanaian city of Tamale etymologically derives its name from the more traditional Dagomba name &#x27;Tama-yile&#x27; (meaning &#x27;Home of Shea nuts&#x27;).

The tree was formerly classified in the genus &quot;Butyrospermum&quot;, meaning &quot;butter seed&quot;. The species name &quot;parkii&quot; honors Scottish explorer Mungo Park, who learned of the tree while exploring Senegal. Park&#x27;s Scottish origin is reflected in the English word shea, with a final -ea.

<text>Heartbreakers is a 2001 American romantic crime comedy film directed by David Mirkin and written by Robert Dunn, Paul Guay, and Stephen Mazur. The film stars Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ray Liotta, Jason Lee, and Gene Hackman. It marks the last onscreen film appearance of Anne Bancroft before her death in June 2005.

&quot;Heartbreakers&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed over $57 million. Weaver was nominated for a Satellite Award for her performance in the film.

==Plot==
Max and Page Conners are a mother-daughter con artist team. When the film opens, the Conners are finishing a con on Dean Cumanno, an auto-body shop owner and small-time crook. The con, which the Conners have played many times before on other men, involves Max marrying Dean, passing out on their wedding night to avoid consummating the marriage, and then Page (posing as Dean&#x27;s secretary) luring Dean into a compromising position to justify Max&#x27;s immediate divorce and hefty settlement. The con is a success.

Page declares that she wants to go solo. Max initially relents, but when they go to the bank to split their earnings, they are confronted by an IRS agent who declares that they owe the government a considerable sum on top of the rest of their savings, which have already been seized. Page reluctantly agrees to work one last con with Max in Palm Beach, to get enough money to pay off the IRS and set Page up to work on her own. For their target, they choose widower William B. Tensy, a tobacco tycoon who is addicted to his own product.

While working the main con with Tensy, Page attempts a side con without her mother&#x27;s knowledge. Page targets beachfront bartender Jack, who is worth $3 million; she tells him that her name is Jane, but develops genuine feelings for him. Max learns of the side con and tells Page to break the relationship off, which Page does reluctantly.

Tensy proposes to Max ahead of schedule, but before they can get married, he accidentally chokes and dies while trying to initiate sex with Max. While Max and Page are deciding what to do with the body, Dean arrives, having tracked Max down to apologize and propose to her again. Dean figures out that Max and Page conned him, and threatens to call the authorities. Max offers to return Dean&#x27;s divorce settlement money if he will help them make Tensy&#x27;s death look like an accident. Max tells Page that their money was never really taken by the IRS; the agent was Max&#x27;s mentor, Barbara, who agreed to help prevent Page from leaving. However, when Max, Page and Dean go to the bank, the money really &quot;is&quot; gone, having been liquidated in an act of betrayal by Barbara.

In order to help Max, Page returns to Jack and accepts his proposal, planning to work it as a regular con. Page insists that Jack will not cheat on her, but is heartbroken when, on their wedding night, she breaks into her mother&#x27;s room and finds him in a compromising position with Max. After the divorce settlement is paid, Dean confronts Max about the ethics of their con, pointing out that even a &quot;goody-goody&quot; like Jack is only human. Max reveals that Jack actually turned her down and that she had to drug him, but she defends her actions by saying that Jack would hurt Page eventually. Dean counters that Max has no right to keep Page from the man she loves because of what &quot;might&quot; happen.

Chastened, Max tells Page the truth, admitting that her efforts to protect her daughter have only hurt her in other ways. Page returns to Jack and both reconcile, giving him back the bar he had sold to sell to pay the settlement, and tells him her real name. Max and Dean also get together, Dean having admitted that he still loves Max despite what she put him through. The final shot of the film is of Dean — using the name &#x27;Stanley&#x27; — romancing Barbara, with Max watching them via binoculars, implying that Max and Dean are now working together to get Max&#x27;s money back from Barbara.

<text>The Tuxedo is a 2002 American science fiction action comedy film directed by Kevin Donovan and starring Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt. It is a spy parody that involves a special tuxedo that grants its wearer superhuman abilities. It also involves a corporate terrorist, threatening to poison the United States&#x27; fresh water supply with bacteria that spills electrolytes into the blood and totally dehydrates the host.

The film received negative reviews from critics upon release and earned a total worldwide box office gross of $104.4 million.

== Plot ==
James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Tong is a taxi driver notorious for his speed and ability to get his customers anywhere in the least amount of time, with no accidents whatsoever. His reputation lands him a job as the personal chauffeur of the mysterious but wealthy Clark Devlin. Jimmy does not really know what his new boss&#x27; job is, but Devlin&#x27;s friendly nature, imperturbable demeanor, and willingness to offer Jimmy advice wins Jimmy over and the two become friends. What Jimmy does not realize is that Devlin is a secret spy and undercover government agent, for an agency called the CSA. When an attempt to kill Devlin with a car bombing sends him into a coma, Jimmy ends up with Devlin&#x27;s recent case notes and a special watch that controls Devlin&#x27;s rather unusual tuxedo.

The tuxedo is a gadget capable of granting its wearer special abilities (including martial arts, speed, the ability to dance, sing, cling to walls, and various acrobatics) which Jimmy must use to stop the criminal organization responsible for Devlin&#x27;s attempted murder. The group is a terrorist organization disguised as a corporation named Banning Corporation and is headed by the notorious and ruthless Dietrich Banning. Its goal is to take over the global drinking water supply, starting with the poisoning of major US reservoirs by means of genetically modified water strider insects. These water striders have bacteria that can spread from person to person, causing severe dehydration. By pure chance, Jimmy is joined by a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, Delilah &quot;Del&quot; Blaine. Blaine is completely new to field work and is delighted to be on assignment with Devlin, only to be very confused by Jimmy as he impersonates Devlin, relying on the tuxedo&#x27;s special abilities to compensate for his lack of skill and training.

At first, Blaine thinks Jimmy is weird and annoying, and then a fraud when Jimmy&#x27;s impersonation is finally exposed. She confiscates his borrowed tuxedo and attempts to stop the evil Dietrich Banning on her own by feigning a desire to become a turncoat for Banning Corporation. Meanwhile, Jimmy is ready to give up and go back to his life as a taxi driver, but while packing his belongings he discovers that Devlin had ordered a second suit for Jimmy himself, believing that Jimmy could also be a great agent. Using his new suit, Jimmy defeats the villain, Banning, by putting a cigarette in Blaine&#x27;s mouth. Banning&#x27;s tuxedo automatically forces him to pull out a lighter and light her cigarette. While Blaine is (comically) puffing on the lit cigarette, Jimmy begins to punch Banning. During the fight, Jimmy throws a glass containing the queen of the water striders into Banning&#x27;s mouth. He is then infected with bacteria from the water strider. The other remaining water striders attack Banning and he then dies instantaneously from terminal dehydration.

As compensation for his role in bringing down Banning, the organization uses its resources to orchestrate an operation so that Jimmy can finally meet his dream girl. However, confused by Blaine&#x27;s and the now-recovered Devlin&#x27;s conflicting instructions on how to act Jimmy succeeds only in alarming the girl into threatening to mace him, resulting in the operation being aborted. Consoling Jimmy afterwards, Blaine admits feeling sad that no one had ever tried to do for her what Jimmy had just done, and Jimmy tells Blaine that she has to change her shrewish personality and be more accommodating if she ever wants to have a boyfriend. Feeling a tentative attraction for each other, they walk away to buy coffee together.

== Production ==
Jackie Chan was unsure about the project adding special effects together with stunts, but was interested to work with DreamWorks for the chance to meet Steven Spielberg. Chan found the American approach to stunts and safety restrictive and wanted to repeat a jump but was not allowed. &quot;American films are different -- it drives me crazy,&quot; said Chan. On her first day of stunts, Jennifer Love Hewitt suffered a broken finger after being struck by one of the stunt men.

Principal photography began in September 2001 and ended in January 2002. During filming in Toronto, Chan and Love Hewitt appeared on an on-set webcam and interacted with fans.

Chan worked on &quot;The Tuxedo&quot; in between shooting &quot;The Medallion&quot;, which started before, and completed shooting later.

==Soundtrack==
After an initial score by Christophe Beck, John Debney was brought in to rescore the film (incorporating Beck&#x27;s thematic material). Both composers ultimately had cues included in the final version.

Varèse Sarabande released a soundtrack album on October 1, 2002, including different cues written by the composers for the same scenes. Cues by Debney are in italics, cues by Beck in bold.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
On a reported budget of $60 million, the film grossed $50.5 million in the United States. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15 million from 3,022 theaters, ranking in second place behind &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;. The film&#x27;s total worldwide gross is $104.4 million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 21% based on 137 reviews and an average rating of 4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Chan is as charming as ever, but his talents are squandered by special effects and bad writing.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 30 out of 100 based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; commented that &quot;The movie is silly beyond comprehension, and even if it weren&#x27;t silly, it would still be beyond comprehension&quot; but does comment that the film has its good moments. He gave the film one and a half stars out of four. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety magazine&quot; says that the film&#x27;s central problem is the mix of Chan&#x27;s actual stunts and effects, which plays against Chan&#x27;s whole career and hard-core commitment to doing all of his own body-defying stunts. He notes that Hewitt &quot;has displayed a Chan-like sweetness herself in past roles&quot; and is disappointed that her character is &quot;a haggling, high-strung shrew who&#x27;s instantly repellent&quot; rather than an amusing sidekick as Chan has had in other Hollywood films. Koehler also criticizes the &quot;pallid direction&quot;, and &quot;virtually incomprehensible plot line&quot;. American film critic Wheeler Winston Dixon described the trademark action comedy as having an &quot;unlikely pairing&quot; of Jennifer Love Hewitt with Chan, and noted that Chan&#x27;s doing his own stunts, even in his middle age, added a &quot;welcome touch of verisimilitude to the endless succession of doubles who normally populate such films.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Asian Journal of Communication&quot; in 2013, academic Zheng Zhu listed the film alongside &quot;&quot; (1993) and &quot;Kiss of the Dragon&quot; (2001) as films that broke from the Western tradition of portraying Asian men as asexual, stating that while they are often featured as heroes in martial arts films, they are rarely portrayed as romantic or loving. Noting the films each show an Asian martial artist with a white female partner, Zhu states they reverse the conventional portrayal of a &quot;dominant white knight and a submissive Oriental lady&quot;. However, he makes critiques of the portrayal of these relationships. For example, each film shows &quot;white women play[ing] the most important role&quot; in helping Chinese men accomplish success. Asian men, Zhu argues, are portrayed as incapable of achieving success in Western society unless they are supported by white femininity.

==Novelization==
A novelization of the film was released by publisher Price Stern Sloan adapted by Ellen Weiss.

<doc id="277716" wikidata="Q1374807" url="?curid=277716" title="John Leech (caricaturist)">
<text>John Leech (29 August 1817 – 29 October 1864) was a British caricaturist and illustrator. He was best known for his work for &quot;Punch&quot;, a humorous magazine for a broad middle-class audience, combining verbal and graphic political satire with light social comedy. Leech catered to contemporary prejudices, such as anti-Americanism and antisemitism and supported acceptable social reforms. Leech&#x27;s critical yet humorous cartoons on the Crimean War helped shape public attitudes toward heroism, warfare, and Britons&#x27; role in the world.

Leech also enjoys fame as the first illustrator of Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. He was furthermore a pioneer in comics, creating the recurring character &quot;Mr. Briggs&quot; and some sequential illustrated gags.

==Early life==
John Leech was born in London. His father, a native of Ireland, was the landlord of the London Coffee House on Ludgate Hill, &quot;a man&quot;, on the testimony of those who knew him, &quot;of fine culture, a profound Shakespearian, and a thorough gentleman.&quot; His mother was descended from the family of Richard Bentley. Like his father. Leech was skillful at drawing with a pencil, which he began doing at a very early age. When he was only three, he was discovered by John Flaxman, who was visiting, seated on his mother&#x27;s knee, drawing with much gravity. The sculptor admired his sketch, adding, &quot;Do not let him be cramped with lessons in drawing; let his genius follow its own bent; he will astonish the world&quot;—advice which was followed. A mail-coach, done when he was six years old, is already full of surprising vigour and variety in its galloping horses. Leech was educated at Charterhouse School, where William Makepeace Thackeray, his lifelong friend, was a fellow pupil, and at sixteen he began to study for the medical profession at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, where he won praise for the accuracy and beauty of his anatomical drawings. He was then placed under a Mr Whittle, an eccentric practitioner, the original of &quot;Rawkins&quot; in Albert Smith&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Mr Ledbury&quot;, and afterwards under John Cockle; but gradually he drifted into the artistic profession. His nickname also being &quot;Blicky&quot; stuck with him during his life, and he used that name to sign some of his works.

==Artistic career==

He was eighteen when his first designs were published, a quarto of four pages, entitled &quot;Etchings and Sketchings by A. Pen, Esq.&quot;, comic character studies from the London streets. Then he drew some political lithographs, did rough sketches for &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot;, produced a popular parody on Mulready&#x27;s postal envelope, and, on the death of Dickens illustrator Robert Seymour in 1836, unsuccessfully submitted his renderings to illustrate &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;.

In 1840 Leech began his contributions to the magazines with a series of etchings in &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, where George Cruikshank had published his plates to &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, and was illustrating &quot;Guy Fawkes&quot; in feebler fashion.

In company with the elder master Leech designed for the &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot; and Stanley Thorn, and until 1847 produced many independent series of etchings. These were not his best work; their technique is imperfect and we never feel that they express the artist&#x27;s individuality, the Richard Savage plates, for instance, being strongly reminiscent of Cruikshank, and &quot;The Dance at Stamford Hall&quot; of Hablot Browne.

In 1845 Leech illustrated St Giles and St James in Douglas William Jerrold&#x27;s new &quot;Shilling Magazine&quot;, with plates more vigorous and accomplished than those in Bentley, but it is in subjects of a somewhat later date, and especially in those lightly etched and meant to be printed with colour, that we see the artist&#x27;s best powers with the needle and acid.
Among such of his designs are four charming plates to Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843), the broadly humorous etchings in the &quot;Comic History of England&quot; (1847–1848), and the still finer illustrations to &quot;The Comic History of Rome&quot; (1851)—which last, particularly in its minor woodcuts, shows some exquisitely graceful touches, as witness the fair faces that rise from the surging water in &quot;Cloelia and her Companions Escaping from the Etruscan Camp&quot;.

Among his other etchings are those in &quot;Young Master Troublesome&quot; or &quot;Master Jacky&#x27;s Holidays&quot;, and the frontispiece to &quot;Hints on Life, or How to Rise in Society&quot; (1845)—a series of minute subjects linked gracefully together by coils of smoke, illustrating the various ranks and conditions of men, one of them—the doctor by his patient&#x27;s bedside—almost equalling in vivacity and precision the best of Cruikshank&#x27;s similar scenes.

Then in the 1850s come the numerous etchings of sporting scenes, contributed, together with woodcuts, to the Handley Cross novels by Robert Smith Surtees.

==Lithographic work==
Leech&#x27;s lithographic work includes the 1841 &quot;Portraits of the Children of the Mobility&quot;, an important series dealing with the humorous and pathetic aspects of London street &quot;Arabs&quot;, which were afterwards so often and so effectively to employ the artist&#x27;s pencil. Amid all the squalor which they depict, they are full of individual beauties in the delicate or touching expression of a face, in the graceful turn of a limb. The book is scarce in its original form, but in 1875 two reproductions of the outline sketches for the designs were published—a lithographic issue of the whole series, and a finer photographic transcript of six of the subjects, which is more valuable than even the finished illustrations of 1841, in which the added light and shade is frequently spotty and ineffective, arid the lining itself has not the freedom which we find in some of Leech&#x27;s other lithographs, notably in the fly leaves, published at the &quot;Punch&quot; office, and in the inimitable subject of the nuptial couch of the Caudles, which also appeared, in woodcut form, as a political cartoon, with Mrs Caudle, personated by Brougham, disturbing by untimely loquacity the slumbers of the lord chancellor, whose haggard cheek rests on the woolsack for pillow.

==Wood engraving==
It was in work for the wood-engravers that Leech was most prolific and individual. Among the earlier of such designs are the illustrations to the &quot;Comic English&quot; and &quot;Latin Grammars&quot; (1840), to &quot;Written Caricatures&quot; (1841), to &quot;Hood&#x27;s Comic Annual&quot;, (1842), and to Albert Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wassail Bowl&quot; (1843), subjects mainly of a small vignette size, transcribed with the best skill of such woodcutters as Orrin Smith, and not, like the larger and later &quot;Punch&quot; illustrations, cut at speed by several engravers working at once on the subdivided block.

It was in 1841 that Leech&#x27;s connection with &quot;Punch&quot; began, a connection which subsisted until his death, and resulted in the production of the best-known and most admirable of his designs. His first contribution appeared in the issue of 7 August, a full-page illustration—entitled &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; of character studies from the neighbourhood of Leicester Square. His cartoons deal at first mainly with social subjects, and are rough and imperfect in execution, but gradually their method gains in power and their subjects become more distinctly political, and by 1849 the artist is strong enough to produce the splendidly humorous national personification which appears in &quot;Disraeli Measuring the British Lion.&quot;

About 1845 we have the first of that long series of half-page and quarter-page pictures of life and manners, executed with a hand as gentle as it was skilful, containing, as Ruskin has said, &quot;admittedly the finest definition and natural history of the classes of our society, the kindest and subtlest analysis of its foibles, the tenderest flattery of its pretty and well-bred ways&quot;, which had yet appeared.

In addition to his work for the weekly issue of &quot;Punch&quot;, Leech contributed largely to the &quot;Punch&quot; almanacks and pocket-books, from &quot;Once a Week&quot; between 1859 and 1862, to &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, where some of his largest and best sporting scenes appeared, and to innumerable novels and miscellaneous volumes besides, of which it is only necessary to specify &quot;A Little Tour in Ireland&quot; (1859). This last piece is noticeable as showing the artist&#x27;s treatment of pure landscape, though it also contains some of his daintiest figure pieces, like that of the wind-blown girl, standing on the summit of a pedestal, with the swifts darting around her and the breadth of sea beyond.

==Public exhibition==
In 1862 Leech appealed to the public with a very successful exhibition of some of the most remarkable of his &quot;Punch&quot; drawings. These were enlarged by a mechanical process, and coloured in oils by the artist himself, with the assistance and under the direction of his friend John Everett Millais. Millais had earlier painted a portrait of a child reading Leech&#x27;s comic book &quot;Mr Briggs&#x27; Sporting Tour&quot;, itself said to have been founded on Leech&#x27;s own visits to Millais, whose favorite shooting and fishing grounds are reproduced in a great number of the drawings.

==Character==
Leech was a rapid and indefatigable worker. Samuel Hole said he observed the artist produce three finished drawings on the wood, designed, traced, and rectified, &quot;without much effort as it seemed, between breakfast and dinner&quot;. The best technical qualities of Leech&#x27;s art, his precision and vivacity in the use of the line, are seen most clearly in the first sketches for his woodcuts, and in the more finished drawings made on tracing paper from these first outlines, before the &quot;chiaroscuro&quot; was added and the designs were transcribed by the engraver. Turning to the mental qualities of his art, it would be a mistaken criticism which ranked him as a comic draughtsman. Like Hogarth he was a true humorist, a student of human life, though he observed humanity mainly in its whimsical aspects,

The earnestness and gravity of moral purpose which is so constant a note in the work of Hogarth is indeed far less characteristic of Leech, but there are touches of pathos and of tragedy in such of the &quot;Punch&quot; designs as the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Friend&quot; (1845), and &quot;General Février turned Traitor&quot; (1855), and in &quot;The Queen of the Arena&quot; in the first volume of &quot;Once a Week&quot;, which are sufficient to prove that more solemn powers, for which his daily work afforded no scope, lay dormant in their artist.

The purity and manliness of Leech&#x27;s own character are impressed on his art. We find in it little of the exaggeration and grotesqueness, and none of the fierce political enthusiasm, of which the designs of James Gillray are so full. Compared with that of his great contemporary, George Cruikshank, his work is restricted both in compass of subject and in artistic dexterity.

==In popular culture==
Leech was played by Simon Callow in the 2017 film &quot;The Man Who Invented Christmas&quot; which depicts the 1843 writing and production of Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

==Death==

Leech died at his home in London on 29 October 1864 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

<text>Jeddah ( ), alternatively transliterated as Jedda, Jiddah or Jidda ( ; , ), is the largest city in Mecca Province, Saudi Arabia, and the country&#x27;s second largest city after Riyadh, located along the Red Sea coast in the Hejaz region. Jeddah is the commercial center of the country. It is not known when Jeddah was founded, but Jeddah&#x27;s prominence grew in 647 when the Caliph Uthman made it a travel hub serving Muslim travelers going to the holy city of Mecca for Islamic pilgrimage. Since those times, Jeddah has served as the gateway for millions of pilgrims who have arrived in Saudi Arabia, traditionally by sea and recently by air.

With a population of about 3,751,722 people as of 2022, Jeddah is the largest city in Mecca Province, the largest city in Hejaz, the second-largest city in Saudi Arabia (after the capital Riyadh), and the ninth-largest in the Middle East. It also serves as the administrative centre of the OIC. Jeddah Islamic Port, on the Red Sea, is the thirty-sixth largest seaport in the world and the second-largest and second-busiest seaport in the Middle East (after Dubai&#x27;s Port of Jebel Ali).

Jeddah is the principal gateway to Mecca Sharif, the holiest city in Islam, to the east, while Medina, the second-holiest city, is to the north. Economically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital investment in scientific and engineering leadership within Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East. Jeddah was ranked fourth in the Africa, MiddIe East, and &#x27;stan countries region in the Innovation Cities Index in 2009.

Jeddah is one of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s primary resort cities and was named a Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). Given the city&#x27;s close proximity to the Red Sea, fishing and seafood dominate the food culture unlike other parts of the country. In Arabic, the city motto is &quot;Jeddah Ghair&quot;, which translates to &quot;Jeddah is different&quot;.

==Etymology and spelling==
There are at least two etymologies of &quot;Jeddah&quot;, according to Jeddah Ibn Al-Qudaa&#x27;iy, the chief of the Quda&#x27;a clan. The more common account has it that the name is derived from &quot;Jaddah&quot;, the Arabic word for &quot;grandmother&quot;. According to folk belief, the Tomb of Eve, who is considered the grandmother of humanity, is located in Jeddah.

The Maghrebi traveler Ibn Battuta visited Jeddah during his world trip in around 1330. He wrote the name of the city into his diary as &quot;Jiddah&quot;.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other branches of the British government formerly used the older spelling of &quot;Jedda&quot;, contrary to other English-speaking usages, but in 2007, it changed to the spelling &quot;Jeddah&quot;.

T. E. Lawrence felt that any transcription of Arabic names into English was arbitrary. In his book &quot;Revolt in the Desert&quot;, Jeddah is spelled in three different ways on the first page alone.

On official Saudi maps and documents, the city name is transcribed &quot;Jeddah&quot;, which is now the prevailing usage.

==History==


===Pre-Islam===
Traces of early activity in the area are testified by some Thamudic inscriptions that were excavated in Wadi Briman (), east of the city, and Wadi Boweb (), northwest of the city. The oldest Mashrabiya found in Jeddah dates back to the pre-Islamic era.

Some believe that Jeddah had been inhabited before Alexander the Great, who had a naval expedition to the Red Sea, by fishermen in the Red Sea, who considered it a center from which they sailed out into the sea as well as a place for relaxation and well-being. According to the Ministry of Hajj, Jeddah has been settled for more than 2500 years.

Excavations in the old city have been interpreted to give the fact that Jeddah was founded as a fishing hamlet by the Yemeni Quda&#x27;a tribe (), who left to settle in Makkah after the collapse of Marib Dam in Yemen in 115 BC.

===Under the Caliphates===
Jeddah first achieved prominence around A.D. 647, when the third Muslim Caliph, Uthman Ibn Affan, turned it into a port making it the port of Makkah instead of Al Shoaib port, which was southwest of Makkah.

The Umayyads inherited the entire Rashidun Caliphate including Hejaz and ruled from 661 to 750. In 702, Jeddah was briefly occupied by pirates from the Kingdom of Axum. However, Jeddah remained a key civilian harbor, serving fishermen and pilgrims travelling by sea for the Hajj. It is also believed that the Sharifdom of Makkah, an honorary Viceroy to the holy land, was first started in this period of the Islamic Caliphate. Jeddah has been established as the main city of the historic Hijaz province and a historic port for pilgrims arriving by sea to perform their Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.

In 750 in the Abbasid Revolution, the Abbasids successfully took control of almost the whole Umayyad Empire, excluding Morocco (Maghrib) and Spain (Al-Andalus). From 876, Jeddah and the surrounding area became the object of wars between the Abbasids and the Tulunids of Egypt, who at one point gained control of the emirates of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Hejaz. The power struggle between the Tulunid Governors and the Abbasids over Hejaz lasted for nearly twenty-five years, until the Tulunids finally withdrew from Arabia in 900.

In 930 AD, the main Hejazi cities of Medina, Mecca and Taif were heavily sacked by the Qarmatians. It is probable, though not historically confirmed, that Jeddah itself was attacked.

Soon after, in early 935, the Ikhshidids, the new power in Egypt, took control of the Hejaz region. There are no historical records that detail the Ikhshidid rule of Hejaz. At this point in time, Jeddah was still unfortified and without walls.

===The Fatimids, Ayyubids, and Mamluks===

In 969 AD, the Fatimids from Algeria took control in Egypt from the Ikhshidid Governors of Abbasids and expanded their empire to the surrounding regions, including The Hijaz and Jeddah. The Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean through the Red Sea. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song dynasty, which eventually determined the economic course of Tihamah during the High Middle Ages.

After Saladin&#x27;s conquest of Jerusalem in 1171, he proclaimed himself sultan of Egypt, after dissolving the Fatimid Caliphate upon the death of al-Adid, thus establishing the Ayyubid dynasty. Ayyubid conquests in Hejaz included Jeddah, which joined the Ayyubid dynasty in 1177 during the leadership of Sharif Ibn Abul-Hashim Al-Thalab (1094–1201). During their relatively short-lived tenure, the Ayyubids ushered in an era of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni dominance in the region by constructing numerous &quot;madrasas&quot; (Islamic schools) in their major cities. Jeddah attracted Muslim sailors and merchants from Sindh, Southeast Asia and East Africa, and other distant regions.

In the year 1258, after the fall of Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Empire, to the Mongols, Hejaz became a part of the Mamluk Sultanate.

The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, having found his way around the Cape and obtaining pilots from the coast of Zanzibar in AD 1497, pushed his way across the Indian Ocean to the shores of Malabar and Calicut, attacked fleets that carried freight and Muslim pilgrims from India to the Red Sea, and struck terror into the surrounding potentates. The Princes of Gujarat and Yemen turned for help to Egypt. Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri accordingly fitted out a fleet of 50 vessels under the Governor of Jeddah, Hussein the Kurd (aka. Mirocem). Jeddah was soon fortified with a wall, using forced labor, as a harbor of refuge from the Portuguese, allowing Arabia and the Red Sea to be protected.

===Ottoman Empire===

In 1517, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, during the reign of Selim I.

The Ottomans rebuilt the weak walls of Jeddah in 1525 following the defense of the city against the Lopo Soares de Albergaria&#x27;s Armada at the Siege of Jeddah (1517). The new stone wall included six watchtowers and six city gates. They were constructed to defend against the Portuguese attack. Of the six gates, the Gate of Mecca was the eastern gate and the Gate of Al-Magharibah, facing the port, was the western gate. The Gate of Sharif faced south. The other gates were the Gate of Al-Bunt, Gate of Al-Sham (also called Gate of Al-Sharaf), and Gate of Medina, facing north. The Turks also built The Qishla of Jeddah, a small castle for the city soldiers. In the 19th century, these seven gates were minimized into four giant gates with four towers. These giant gates were the Gate of Sham to the north, the Gate of Mecca to the east, the Gate of Sharif to the south, and the Gate of Al-Magharibah on the seaside.

Jeddah became a direct Ottoman Eyalet, while the remaining Hejaz under Sharif Barakat II became a vassal state to the Ottoman Empire eight years after the Siege of Jeddah in 1517. The Portuguese attempted to attack the port again in 1541, but were repelled.

Parts of the city wall still survive today in the old city. Even though the Portuguese were successfully repelled from the city, fleets in the Indian Ocean were at their mercy. This was evidenced by the Battle of Diu. The Portuguese soldiers&#x27; cemetery can still be found within the old city today and is referred to as the site of the Christian Graves.

Ahmed Al-Jazzar, the Ottoman military man mainly known for his role in the Siege of Acre, spent the earlier part of his career at Jeddah. In Jeddah in 1750, he killed some seventy rioting nomads in retaliation for the killing of his commander, Abdullah Beg, earning him the nickname &quot;Jezzar&quot; (butcher).

On 15 June 1858, rioting in the city, believed to have been instigated by a former police chief in reaction to British policy in the Red Sea, led to the massacre of 25 Christians, including the British and French consuls, members of their families, and wealthy Greek merchants. The British frigate , anchored at port, bombarded the city for two days in retaliation.

===First Saudi State and Ottoman–Saudi War===
In 1802, Nejdi forces conquered both Mecca and Jeddah from the Ottomans. When Sharif Ghalib Efendi informed Sultan Mahmud II of this, the Sultan ordered his Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha to retake the city. Muhammad Ali successfully regained the city in the Battle of Jeddah in 1813.

===World War I and the Hashemite Kingdom===

During World War I, Sharif Hussein bin Ali declared a revolt against the Ottoman Empire, seeking independence from the Ottoman Turks and the creation of a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen.

King Hussein declared the Kingdom of Hejaz. Later, Hussein was involved in a war with Ibn Saud, who was the Sultan of Nejd. Hussein abdicated following the fall of Mecca, in December 1924, and his son Ali bin Hussein became the new king.

===Kingdom of Saudi Arabia===
A few months later, Ibn Saud, whose clan originated in the central Nejd province, conquered Medina and Jeddah via an agreement with Jeddans following the Second Battle of Jeddah. He deposed Ali bin Hussein, who fled to Baghdad, eventually settling in Amman, Jordan, where his descendants became part of its Hashemite royalty.

As a result, Jeddah came under the sway of the Al-Saud dynasty in December 1925. In 1926, Ibn Saud added the title King of Hejaz to his position of Sultan of Nejd. Today, Jeddah has lost its historical role in peninsular politics after it fell within the new province of Makkah, whose provincial capital is the city of Mecca.

From 1928 to 1932, the new Khuzam Palace was built as the new residence of King Abdul Aziz in Jeddah. The palace lies south of the old walled city and was constructed under the supervision of the engineer Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. After 1963, the palace was used as a royal guest house; since 1995, it has housed the Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography.

The remaining walls and gates of the old city were demolished in 1947. A fire in 1982 destroyed some ancient buildings in the old town center, called Al-Balad, but much is still preserved. A house-by-house survey of the old districts was made in 1979, showing that some 1000 traditional buildings still existed, though the number of structures with great historic value was far less. In 1990, a Jeddah Historical Area Preservation Department was founded.

The modern city has expanded wildly beyond its old boundaries. The built-up area expanded mainly to the north along the Red Sea coastline, reaching the new airport during the 1990s and since edging its way around it toward the Ob&#x27;hur Creek, some from the old city center.

In October 2021, Saudi authorities, led by Mohammad bin Salman, initiated a large-scale demolition and eviction plan in neighborhoods in the southern part of Jeddah to make way for the Jeddah Central Project, a revitalization project under Saudi Vision 2030. The demolitions affected 558,000 people in more than 60 neighborhoods. Amnesty International confirmed through official documents that some of the residents were notified about evictions only 24 hours before, while others were between 1–6 weeks. In some cases &quot;evacuate&quot; was written on the buildings, while the state media and billboards informed others about the demolitions to others. Saudi state media claimed the majority of affected neighborhoods were &quot;rife with diseases, crime, drugs and theft&quot; and home to predominantly undocumented immigrants. In January 2022, Saudi authorities announced a compensation scheme that accounted for 47% of those evicted.

==Geography==
Jeddah is located in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Red Sea coastal plain (called Tihamah). Jeddah lies in the Hijazi Tihama () region which is in the lower Hijaz mountains. Historically, politically and culturally, Jeddah was a major city of Hejaz Vilayet, the Kingdom of Hejaz and other regional political entities according to Hijazi history books. It is the 100th largest city in the world by land area.

===Climate===
Jeddah features an arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) under Koppen&#x27;s climate classification, with a tropical temperature range. Unlike other Saudi Arabian cities, Jeddah retains its warm temperature in winter, which can range from at dawn to in the afternoon. Summer temperatures are extremely hot, often breaking the mark in the afternoon. Summers are also quite steamy, with dew points often exceeding , particularly in September.

Rainfall in Jeddah is generally sparse, and usually occurs in small amounts in November and December. Heavy thunderstorms are common in winter. The thunderstorm of December 2008 was the largest in recent memory, with rain reaching around . The lowest temperature ever recorded in Jeddah was on February 10, 1993. The highest temperature ever recorded in Jeddah was on June 22, 2010, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Saudi Arabia.

Dust storms happen in summer and sometimes in winter, coming from the Arabian Peninsula&#x27;s deserts or from North Africa. Occasionally, the dust storms accompany thunderstorms.

==Economy==
Jeddah has long been a port city. Even before being designated the port city for Mecca, Jeddah was a trading hub for the region. In the 19th century, goods such as mother-of-pearl, tortoise shells, frankincense, and spices were routinely exported from the city. Apart from this, many imports into the city were destined for further transit to the Suez, Africa, or Europe. Many goods passing through Jeddah could not be normally found in the city or even in Arabia.

All of the capitals of the Middle East and North Africa are within two hours flying distance of Jeddah, making it the second commercial center of the Middle East after Dubai.

Also, Jeddah&#x27;s industrial district is the fourth largest in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh, Jubail and Yanbu.

===King Abdullah Street===
King Abdullah Street is one of the most important streets in Jeddah and runs from King Fahd Road by the waterfront in the west of Jeddah to the eastern end of the city. It is famous for hosting numerous corporate offices and commercial developments. It will be near the HSR Entrance in Jeddah central train station which connects Jeddah with Makkah, Al-Madinah, and King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC). It also has the second tallest flagpole in the world at a height of 170 m (558 ft). This road faced a catastrophe in 2011 when it was submerged with rainwater.

===Tahliyah Street===

Tahliyah Street(EXT. Prince Mohamed Bin Abdulaziz St) is an important fashion and shopping street in central Jeddah. It contains many upscale departments and high fashion brands stores as well as boutiques. It has been renamed &quot;Prince Mohammad bin Abdul Aziz Road&quot; by the government, but this official name is not widely used. It also has many fine dining options.

===Madinah Road===
Madinah Road is a historically significant street in Jeddah. It links the Southern districts with the North and contains the Main offices of several companies and showrooms. The northern end of the road links to the King Abdul Aziz Int&#x27;l Airport, which is a contributing factor to heavy traffic on this road at most times during the day.

==Culture==
===Religious significance===
Most citizens are Sunni Muslims. The government, courts, and civil and criminal laws enforce a moral code established by Shari&#x27;ah. A very small minority of Saudi citizens are Shia Muslims, and there is also a large foreign workforce, mainly from countries like the Philippines and Pakistan.

The city has over 1,300 mosques. The law does not allow other religions&#x27; buildings, books, icons, and expressions of faith. However, private religious observance not involving Muslims nor offending public order and morality is tolerated.

Since the 7th century, Jeddah has hosted millions of Muslim pilgrims from all over the world on their way to the Hajj. This merge with pilgrims has a major impact on the society, religion, and economy of Jeddah.

===Cuisine===
Jeddah&#x27;s multi-ethnic citizenry has influenced Jeddah&#x27;s traditional cuisine.

Some dishes are native to the Hejaz, like Saleeg. Mabshūr () is a white-rice dish, cooked in broth, often made with chicken instead of lamb meat. Jeddah cuisine is popular as well, with dishes like Foul, Shorabah Hareira (Hareira soup), Mugalgal, Madhbi (chicken grilled on stone), Madfun (literally meaning &quot;buried&quot;), Magloobah, Kibdah, Manzalah (usually eaten at Eid ul-Fitr), Magliya (a local version of falafel) and Saiyadyia able to be acquired in many traditional restaurants around the city, such as Althamrat, Abu-Zaid, Al-Quarmooshi, Ayaz, and Hejaziyat.

Some dishes popular in the city were imported from other Saudi regions, like Kabsa from Najd and Arīka () and Ma&#x27;sūb () from the southern Saudi region. Other dishes were imported from other cultures through Saudis of different origins, like Mantu, Yaghmush () and Ruz Bukhāri () from Central Asia, Burēk, Šurēk, and Kabab Almīru () from Turkey and the Balkans, Mandi from Yemen, Mutabbag () from Yemen-Malaysia, Biryāni and Kābli () rice dishes from South Asia.

The most popular local fast-food chain, begun in 1974, is Al Baik, with branches in Jeddah and the neighboring cities of Makkah, Madinah and Yanbu. Their main dish is broasted (broiled and roasted) chicken, commonly known by Jeddawis as &quot;Broast&quot;, and a variety of seafood. The popular fast food chain recently opened branches in Riyadh, Dammam, Buraidah, Bahrain, and Dubai in the UAE.

===Open-air art===

During the oil boom in the late 1970s and 1980s, there was a focused civic effort led by Mohamed Said Farsi, who was then the city&#x27;s mayor, to bring art to Jeddah&#x27;s public areas. As a result, Jeddah contains a large number of modern open-air sculptures and works of art, typically situated in roundabouts. Sculptures include works by Jean/Hans Arp, César Baldaccini, Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, Joan Miró, Hubert Minnebo and Victor Vasarely. They often depict traditional Saudi items such as coffee pots, incense burners, palm trees, etc. Islamic tradition prohibits the depiction of living creatures, especially the human form, and this has affected the art. Other statues include a giant geometry set, a giant bicycle, a huge block of concrete with several cars protruding from it at odd angles, and a monumental sculpture by Aref Rayess called &quot;Swords of God (Soyuf Allah)&quot;. At the interchange between Al-Madinah Road, King Abdulaziz Road, and Prince Abullah Al-Faisal Road, there are large sculptures of camels that are the center of a roundabout. The roundabout is commonly known as &#x27;The Camel Roundabout&#x27;.

===Museums and collections===
There are about a dozen museums or collections in Jeddah, with varied educational aims and professionalism. These include the Jeddah Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography run by the Deputy Ministry of Antiquities and Museums, the Jeddah Municipal Museum, the Nasseef House, the Humane Heritage Museum, the private Abdul Rauf Hasan Khalil Museum and the private Arts Heritage Museum.

===Events and festivals===
====Red Sea International Film Festival====
Jeddah was selected as the place for the annual Red Sea International Film Festival that was held in 2020.

====Jeddah International Book Fair====
Jeddah hosts an annual international book fair called Jeddah International Book Fair. It is the second largest book fair in Saudi Arabia, and it was first held in 2015. The book fair is held annually in early December.

====Jeddah Season====
Jeddah Season is a part of the Saudi government&#x27;s Saudi Seasons initiative that aims at launching high-level tourism activities in Saudi Arabia. The first version of the season was held in June–July 2019. Around 150 activities and events were organized in five destinations in Jeddah. Saudi Seasons 2019 aimed at shedding light on the diverse Saudi culture and heritage. Jeddah was chosen because it is one of the most culturally-rich Saudi cities, with a history that spans over 3,000 years. Most of Jeddah Season&#x27;s events and activities were held at King Abdullah Sports City, Jeddah&#x27;s historical area, Al-Hamra Corniche, and the Jeddah Waterfront.
Jeddah Season aims to make Jeddah the most preferred tourist destination in the world and the best season of all the Saudi Seasons.

===Media===
Jeddah is served by four major Arabic-language newspapers, &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot;, &quot;Al Madina&quot;, &quot;Okaz&quot;, and &quot;Al Bilad&quot;, as well as two major English-language newspapers, the &quot;Saudi Gazette&quot; and &quot;Arab News&quot; (which also covers other Middle Eastern events). &quot;Okaz&quot; and &quot;Al-Madina&quot; are the primary newspapers of Jeddah and some other Saudi cities, with over a million readers; their focus is mainly local.

Internet blogs specifically informative of the locality are abundant in Jeddah, catering mostly to the widespread expatriate population. Of these are constituted websites that have garnered international acclaim for informativeness, such as Jeddah Blog, the recipient of the Bronze Expat Blog Award in 2012 and the Gold Award in 2013 and among Feedspot&#x27;s Top 100 Middle East blogs. Other amateur websites relating to specific topics in the region exist as well.

Jeddah represents the largest radio and television market in Saudi Arabia. Television stations serving the city area include Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al Ekhbariya, the ART channels network and hundreds of cable, satellite, and other specialty television providers.

The Jeddah TV Tower is a high television tower with an observation deck.

===Accent===
The Jeddah region&#x27;s distinctive speech pattern is called the Hejazi dialect. It is among the most recognizable of all accents in the Arabic language.

==Cityscape==

===Old Jeddah===

The Old City known as Al-Balad, with its traditional multistory buildings and merchant houses that often still belong to the families that inhabited them before the oil-era, has lost ground to more modern developments. Nonetheless, the Old City contributes to the cultural identity of Jeddah and the Hijaz more generally. Since it was granted UNESCO World Heritage status, in 2014, several traditional buildings have been restored and made open to the public. In 2019, the Saudi crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, issued a royal decree ordering the Ministry of Culture to restore 50 historical buildings in Jeddah. Several historic mosques from different eras are located in al-Balad, as well as one of the oldest museums in the city, called Bayt Naseef (the House of Naseef), which displays local furniture and interior design from the past 150 years, approximately.
===Resorts and hotels===
The city has many popular resorts, including Durrat Al-Arus, Al-Nawras Mövenpick resort at the Red Sea Corniche, Crystal Resort, Radisson Blu, The Signature Al Murjan Beach Resort, Al Nakheel Village, Sands, and Sheraton Abhur. Many are renowned for their preserved Red Sea marine life and offshore coral reefs.

===Consulates===
One of the two consulates of the United States of America in Saudi Arabia is located in Jeddah, along with the consulates for 67 other countries such as Afghanistan, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Italy, Russia and Mainland China. Some of the other consulates present include countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League states.

== Historical Jeddah ==

Historical Jeddah is situated on the eastern shore of the Red Sea. From the 7th century AD, it was established as a major port for Indian Ocean trade routes, channeling goods to Mecca. It was also the gateway for Muslim pilgrims to Mecca who arrived by sea. These twin roles saw the city develop into a thriving multicultural center, characterized by a distinctive architectural tradition, including tower houses built in the late 19th century by the city&#x27;s mercantile elites, and combining Red Sea coastal coral building traditions with influences and crafts from along the trade routes.

Within a defensive wall that was built during Ottoman rule, the old city of Jeddah, Al-Balad, was divided into districts, or &quot;Haras&quot;, where business and trade centered around traditional &quot;souks&quot;, or market places, and &quot;khans&quot;, covered markets that were generally connected to shops.

===Harrat Al-Mathloum (District of the Wronged)===
Located in the northeast of Jeddah, this district was named after Abdulkarim Al-Barzangi, a Hijazi rebel who was crucified by the Ottomans. Some of its landmarks are:

* Dar Al-Qabil
* Dar Al-Ba&#x27;ashin
* Dar Al-Sheikh
* The Al-Shafi&#x27;i mosque 
The oldest mosque in town, its minaret was built in the 13th century, and its pillars date back to Ottoman rule.
* Mosque of Uthman bin Affan

===Jeddah Municipality Tower===
This is the headquarters of the metropolitan area of Jeddah. The municipality&#x27;s new building is going to be not only Jeddah&#x27;s tallest but is also going to dethrone the Burj Khalifa.

This proposed tower, formerly known as the Kingdom Tower, is being built in Jeddah by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and will stand tall. Upon its completion, it will be the tallest skyscraper in the world. The building has been scaled down from its initial proposal, since the ground proved unsuitable for a building that tall, to a height of at least (the exact height is being kept private while in development, similar to the Burj Khalifa), which, at about one kilometer (), would still make it by far the tallest building or structure in the world to date, standing at least taller than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Construction began in April 2013 and there was steady progress, but in January 2018, building owner JEC halted structural concrete work with the tower about one-third completed due to labor issues with a contractor following the 2017–19 Saudi Arabian purge. JEC had said they planned to restart construction in 2020. In September 2023 MEED reported that the construction of the tower had restarted. Completion is expected in 2029.

The flagpole succeeded Dushanbe Flagpole as the tallest flagpole in the world until 26 December 2021, when the Cairo Flagpole in Cairo, Egypt was erected at a height of 201.952 m (662.57 ft).

===Entrance of Mecca===
Bab Makkah, also known as Makkah Gate, is a limestone coral gateway that leads into the historic Al-Balad district of Jeddah.

The Makkah Gate, named the &quot;Quran Gate&quot;, is located 60 km outside Jeddah on the Makkah Mukkarram road of the Jeddah - Makkah Highway. It is the entrance to Mecca and the birthplace of Muhammad. The gate signifies the boundary of the Haram area of the city of Makkah, where non-Muslims are prohibited to enter. The gate was designed in 1979 by Egyptian architect Samir Elabd for the architectural firm IDEA Center. The structure is that of a book, representing the Quran, sitting on a &quot;rehal&quot;, or book stand.

===Libraries===
The central library at King Abdulaziz University (main branch) is a five-story building that has a large collection of Arabic and English language books, rare books, and documents as well as access to several online databases. It is open for public access and allows the borrowing of books after requesting a library card. Saturdays are dedicated to female visitors.

King Abdul Aziz Public Library is a philanthropic institution that was founded and supported by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz, chairman of its board of directors. Established in 1985, the library was officially opened by the King on 27 February 1987. It emphasizes Islamic and Arabic heritage and history of the Kingdom. The library is divided into three branches (men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and children&#x27;s).

The limited number of libraries is criticized by the public. As a result, King Abdullah, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, has approved the King Abdullah Project for the Development of Public Libraries, and approximately SAR150 million is budgeted to be spent.

In April 2014, Prince Mishaal Ibn Abdullah Abdulaziz opened a new public library in Jeddah by Makkah Governor, under the name of King Fahd Public Library.

King Fahd Public Library was built over an area of within the main Campus of King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah. It includes a diverse collection of books and reference material classified into three sections to meet the needs and wants of a wide range of readership. Spaces have been set apart for youths, children and women.

==Sports==
Jeddah is the home of two large and well-known football clubs, Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli. Both teams play their league matches at King Abdullah Stadium, which is located in the northern part of Jeddah near King Abdulaziz Airport. It was the host city for the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup.
The city is also home to the Saudi Arabian basketball Giants Al-Ittihad its the basketball section of the football club, which plays its home games in the Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Basketball Arena. 

On 5 November 2020, it was announced that Jeddah would host the 21st round of the 2021 FIA Formula 1 World Championship. The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is a street circuit, winding through the Jeddah Corniche along the Red Sea, north of the main part of the city. The race debuted on 5 December 2021, and is scheduled to be held in the city until 2030. In the 2022 edition of the race, Mexican driver Sergio Pérez achieved his maiden pole position in his 215th race, becoming the driver with most races before pole position.

==Transport==
===Airport===

Jeddah is served by King Abdulaziz International Airport. The airport has four passenger terminals. One is the Hajj Terminal, a special outdoor terminal covered by large white tents, which was constructed to handle the more than two million pilgrims who pass through the airport during the Hajj season. The Southern Terminal is used by Saudia and Flynas (both based in Saudi Arabia), while the Northern Terminal serves foreign airlines. A plan for the extension of the airport is being developed. The Royal Terminal is a special terminal reserved for VIPs, foreign kings and presidents, and the Saudi royal family. A portion of the airport, King Abdullah Air Base, was used by Coalition B-52 heavy bombers during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.
Before King Abdulaziz Airport opened in 1981, Kandara Airport served Jeddah. It was at Kandara, a neighborhood very near the town center. However, the old Jeddah airport experienced heavy congestions, especially during Hajj seasons. After the airport became defunct, the area was redeveloped for housing.

===Seaport===

Jeddah Seaport is the 40th busiest seaport in the world . It handles the majority of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s commercial movement.

In 2017, Jeddah Seaport handled 4,309,765 TEUs and in the year 2018 handled 4,215,248 TEUs.

Jeddah is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the Upper Adriatic region with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe.

===Road and rail===
Highway 40, which begins in Jeddah, connects the city to Mecca, Riyadh and Dammam on the east coast. Jeddah does not have any rapid transit system, but the Haramain High Speed Rail Project provides a connection to Mecca and Medina. There is a contracted plan to build an extensive light metro system known as the Jeddah Metro, throughout the city, originally by 2020. Jeddah&#x27;s main highways run parallel to each other.

==Issues and challenges==
The city is challenged by pollution, weak sewage systems, a weak storm drain system that led to massive flooding, heavy traffic, epidemics, and water shortages.

===Pollution and environment===
Air pollution is a problem for Jeddah, particularly on hot summer days. The city has experienced bush fires, landfill fires, and pollution from the two industrial zones in the north and the south of the metropolitan area. A water treatment factory and the seaport also contribute to water pollution. Much of the seafront, however, is considered to be safe and clean. Ramboll has acted as Environmental Consultant on the Jeddah Environmental Impact Assessment as well as the Jeddah Environmental Social Masterplan.

===Terrorism===
At mid-day on 6 December 2004, militants loyal to the regional affiliate of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda launched an attack on the U.S. Consulate, killing five employees. The group was led by Fayez ibn Awwad Al-Jeheni, a former member of the religious police. Two of the other assailants were subsequently identified by Saudi authorities as residents of Jeddah&#x27;s Al-Jamia suburb and other slums on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s increasingly urbanized west coast. Buildings were attacked, hostages taken and used as human shields, targeting both Americans and non-Americans alike. Despite enduring a protracted siege, the chancery/consular section of the building was never penetrated. Closed-circuit video feeds documented that the Saudi security personnel assigned to protect the facility fled when the vehicle holding the terrorists pulled up to the front gate and ran past the Delta barrier. Inside the compound, however, an armed Saudi security guard employed by the embassy shot and killed one of the five terrorists before being fatally shot himself.

The attackers spread and ignited a flammable liquid on the front of the chancery building, and opened fire on the front doors, both of which actions did not have any penetrating effect. The Consulate&#x27;s U.S. Marines released tear gas in front of the chancery building, but the terrorists had already left that location. More than an hour later, Saudi special forces made it through traffic and, along with others from their unit who arrived in a helicopter, fought to retake the compound. In the final shootout, two of the terrorists were killed, with another dying later in hospital, and one militant was captured alive. Four Saudi special forces and a further ten hostages were wounded in the crossfire.

The five U.S. Foreign Service employees killed in the terrorist attack were Ali Yaslem Bin Talib, Imad e-Deen Musa Ali, Romeo de la Rosa, Mohammed Baheer Uddin, and Jaufar Sadik, nationals of Yemen, Sudan, Philippines, India and Sri Lanka, respectively.

The attack underscored the ongoing vulnerabilities of Westerners to threats, terrorist actions, and the environs. In a communiqué posted in online publications such as &quot;Sawt al-Jihad&quot; (Voice of Jihad) and &quot;Mu&#x27;askar al-Battar&quot; (Al-Battar Training Camp), Al-Qaeda hinted at the symbolic nature of the U.S. Consulate attack, stating: &quot;Know that the Mujahideen are determined to continue on their path, and they will not be weakened by what has happened to them.&quot;

Terrorist activities have persisted from 2004 to the present day. In 2004, there was an unsuccessful shooting attack on a U.S. Marine visiting the Saudi American Bank and an attempt to simultaneously explode car bombs at Saudi American Bank and Saudi British Bank branches in Jeddah on the anniversary of the 2001 &quot;9-11&quot; terrorist attacks on the U.S. On 26 August 2012, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry announced that terrorists were arrested in Jeddah who had been preparing explosives for attacks within the kingdom.

In 2022, the Houthis launched a missile attack against an Aramco facility near the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, where the Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix was held.

===Traffic===

Roads and highways within and exiting the city are frequently clogged with traffic. Mass transit is rare and planning is nascent; most Jeddawi adults have at least one car. Days immediately preceding and following the holy days are particularly noisome and cost hundreds of thousands of person-hours because of traffic jams.

The &quot;Saudi Gazette&quot; reports that there is a plan in the works to tackle the traffic issue. A reported three billion Saudi Riyals will be put into constructing flyovers and underpasses in an effort to expedite traffic. The plan is scheduled to take about five years from its start to finish.

===Sewage===
Prior to the construction of a waste treatment plant, Jeddah&#x27;s wastewater was disposed of by either discharge into the sea or via absorption into deep underground pits. However, even with the ever-increasing population, the original sewer system has hardly been expanded. The original plant cannot cope with the amount of waste inundating it daily. As a result, some untreated sewage is discharged directly into the sea and the entire northern part of the city remains completely unconnected to the sewage system, instead relying on septic tanks. This has been responsible for a large number of sewage tankers.

In late 2011, a storm drainage system was built in the south Jeddah area (similar to that of the Los Angeles storm drain) to reduce the risk of floods.

===Floods===
On 25 November 2009, heavy floods affected the city and other areas of Makkah Province. The floods were described by civil defence officials as the worst in 27 years. , 77 people were reported to have been killed, and more than 350 were missing. Some roads were under a meter (three feet) of water on 26 November, and many of the victims were believed to have drowned in their cars. At least 3,000 vehicles were swept away or damaged. The death toll was expected to rise as flood waters receded, allowing rescuers to reach stranded vehicles.

On 26 January 2011, again, heavy floods affected the city and other areas of Makkah Province. The cumulative rainfall exceeded the recorded in four hours during the 25 November 2009 flash floods. Streets including Palestine Street, Madinah Road, and Wali Al-Ahad Street were either flooded or jammed with traffic. Cars were seen floating in some places. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses told local newspaper &quot;Arab News&quot; that East Jeddah was swamped and floodwater was rushing west towards the Red Sea, turning streets into rivers once again.

On 17 November 2015, heavy floods affected the city. Streets affected by the flood include Palestine Street, Madinah Road, and many others. Cars were seen burning, and many trees fell as a result of the violent flood. Three deaths were also reported. Two of the fatalities (including a child) were hit by lightning while crossing a street.

On 21 November 2017, heavy floods affected the city once more and Jeddah Islamic Port stopped operations for about three hours. Jeddah police received 11,000 phone calls on 911 from people enquiring about alternative roads and weather conditions. There were 250 reports of electrocution. Five people were electrocuted, two died.

On 24 November 2022, heavy floods affected Jeddah. Jeddah was heavily damaged from the flood and cause more than thousands of cars to be damaged by the flood and caused power outage to most of the city and the flood was approximately 1-2 meters high. As a result, flights were delayed, schools were closed, and two people were killed.

<text>Kathrin Romany Beckinsale (born 26 July 1973) is an English actress. The only child of actors Richard Beckinsale and Judy Loe, she debuted onstage in a 1992 production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;.

In 1993, she made her theatrical film debut with a brief role in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s adaptation &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; whilst studying at the University of Oxford. She played leading roles in numerous British costume dramas such as &quot;Prince of Jutland&quot; (1994), &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1995), &quot;Emma&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (2000). She also starred in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), &quot;Serendipity&quot; (2001), &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), and &quot;Click&quot; (2006).

Since taking the role of Selene in the &quot;Underworld&quot; film series (2003–2016), Beckinsale became known for her work in action films, including &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004), &quot;Whiteout&quot; (2009), &quot;Contraband&quot; (2012), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (2012), and &quot;Jolt&quot; (2021) while also earning praise for her roles in the small-scale dramas &quot;Snow Angels&quot; (2007), &quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot; (2008), &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot; (2009), &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; (2017). She returned to television in the limited series &quot;The Widow&quot; (2019).

==Early life and education==
Kathrin Romany Beckinsale was born on 26 July 1973 in the Chiswick district of London, the only child of actors Richard Beckinsale and Judy Loe. Her half-sister from her father&#x27;s earlier marriage is actress Samantha Beckinsale. Her father was partly of Burmese descent. Her parents did not marry until 1977, prior to Beckinsale starting nursery school, when she made her first television appearance at age four, in an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, dedicated to her father. When she was five, her father died suddenly of a heart attack, aged 31. She was deeply traumatised by the loss and &quot;started expecting bad things to happen.&quot;

Her widowed mother moved in with director Roy Battersby when Beckinsale was nine and she was brought up alongside his four sons and daughter. She had a close relationship with her stepfather, who was a member of the Workers Revolutionary Party during her youth. She helped to sell &quot;The News Line&quot;, a Trotskyist newspaper, as a little girl and has said the household phone was tapped following Battersby&#x27;s blacklisting by the BBC. Family friends included Ken Loach and Vanessa Redgrave.

Beckinsale was educated at Godolphin and Latymer School, an independent school for girls in Hammersmith, West London, and was involved with the Orange Tree Youth Theatre. She was twice a winner of the WH Smith Young Writers Award for both fiction and poetry. She has described herself as a &quot;late bloomer&quot;: &quot;All of my friends were kissing boys and drinking cider way before me. I found it really depressing that we weren&#x27;t making camp fires and everyone was doing stuff like that.&quot; She had a nervous breakdown and developed anorexia aged 15, and underwent Freudian psychoanalysis for four years.

Beckinsale studied Russian at school and read French and Russian literature at New College, Oxford, and was later described by her contemporary Victoria Coren Mitchell, as &quot;whip-clever, slightly nuts, and very charming&quot;. She became friends with
Roy Kinnear&#x27;s daughter Kirsty. She was involved with the Oxford University Dramatic Society, most notably being directed by fellow student Tom Hooper in a production of &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; at the Oxford Playhouse. As a Modern Languages student, she was required to spend her third year abroad, and studied in Paris. She then quit university to focus on her burgeoning acting career: &quot;It was getting to the point where I wasn&#x27;t enjoying either thing enough because both were very high pressure.&quot; Beckinsale has stated she would like to complete her studies at Oxford University.

==Career==
===1991–1997: Early acting roles===
Beckinsale decided at a young age she wanted to be an actress: &quot;I grew up immersed in film. My family were in the business. I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends&#x27; parents.&quot; She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau. She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P. D. James&#x27; &quot;Devices and Desires&quot;. In 1992, she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Dream,&quot; a 30‑minute Channel 4 short. In 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, &quot;Anna Lee,&quot; starring Imogen Stubbs.

In 1993, Beckinsale landed the role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s big-screen adaptation of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University. She attended the film&#x27;s Cannes Film Festival premiere and remembered it as an overwhelming experience. &quot;Nobody even told me I could bring a friend!&quot; &quot;I had Doc Martens boots on, and I think I put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was won over by her &quot;lovely&quot; performance. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard &quot;look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak.&quot; The film grossed over $22 million at the box office.

She made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Prince of Jutland&quot;, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and starred in the murder mystery &quot;Uncovered&quot;. In 1995, while studying in Paris, she filmed the French language &quot;Marie-Louise ou la permission&quot;.

Shortly after leaving Oxford University in 1995, Beckinsale starred in &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, as Flora Poste, a newly orphaned 1930s socialite sent to live with distant family members in rural England. The John Schlesinger-directed film was an adaptation of Stella Gibbons&#x27;s novel and also featured Joanna Lumley, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell and Stephen Fry. Beckinsale was initially considered too young, but was cast after she wrote a pleading letter to the director. Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; was reminded of &quot;the strength of a young Glenda Jackson and the charm of a young Julie Christie.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; classed the actress as &quot;yet another of those effortlessly skilled British beauties who light up the screen.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt she played the role &quot;with the perfect snippy aplomb.&quot; The film grossed over $5 million at the US box office.

Also in 1995, she appeared in &quot;Haunted&quot;, a ghost story in which Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; felt she &quot;holds the screen, with both physical looks and verbal poise.&quot; 1995 saw Beckinsale&#x27;s first professional stage appearance, as Nina in &quot;The Seagull&quot; at Theatre Royal, Bath. She became romantically involved with co-star Michael Sheen after meeting during play rehearsals. She later said: &quot;I was all revved up to feel very intimidated. It was my first-ever play and my mother had cut out reviews of him in previous productions. And then he walked in ... It was almost like, &#x27;God, well, I&#x27;m finished now. That&#x27;s it, then.&#x27;... He&#x27;s the most outrageously talented person I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot; Irving Wardle of &quot;The Independent&quot; felt that &quot;the casting, including Michael Sheen&#x27;s volcanic Kostya and Kate Beckinsale&#x27;s steadily freezing Nina, is mainly spot-on.&quot; In early 1996, she starred in two further plays, &quot;Sweetheart&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre and &quot;Clocks and Whistles&quot; at the Bush Theatre.

Beckinsale next starred in an ITV adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot;, playing Emma to Mark Strong&#x27;s Mr Knightley and Samantha Morton&#x27;s Harriet Smith. &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t necessarily like Emma,&quot; Beckinsale has said of her character. &quot;You do love her, but in the way the family of a young girl could be exasperated by her outrageous behaviour and still love her.&quot; The programme was aired in autumn 1996, just months after Gwyneth Paltrow had starred in a film adaptation of the same story. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that while &quot;Ms. Beckinsale&#x27;s Emma is plainer looking than Ms. Paltrow&#x27;s,&quot; she is &quot;altogether more believable and funnier.&quot; Jonathan Brown of &quot;The Independent&quot; has described Beckinsale&#x27;s interpretation as &quot;the most enduring modern performance&quot; as Emma.

In 1997, Beckinsale appeared opposite Stuart Townsend in the comedy &quot;Shooting Fish&quot;, one of the most commercially successful British films of that year. &quot;I&#x27;d just had my wisdom teeth out,&quot; Beckinsale later recalled of the initial audition. &quot;I was also on very strong painkillers, so it was not the most conventional of meetings.&quot; Elley wrote of &quot;an incredibly laid-back performance&quot;. Thomas felt she &quot;just glows as an aristocrat facing disaster with considerable aplomb.&quot; She narrated Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot; for Hodder &amp; Stoughton AudioBooks and Diana Hendry&#x27;s &quot;The Proposal&quot; for BBC Radio 4. Also in 1997, she played Juliet to Michael Sheen&#x27;s Romeo, in an audio production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, directed by Sheen.

In Beckinsale&#x27;s last film before her move to the US, she starred as Alice in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Alice Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, released in July 1998.

===1998–2002: Move to Hollywood===
At this point in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, something she has said wasn&#x27;t &quot;a conscious decision... My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that&#x27;s why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films.&quot; She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot;. The Whit Stillman film focused on a group of mostly Ivy League and Hampshire College graduates socialising in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale&#x27;s American accent was widely praised. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was &quot;beautifully played.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; was unimpressed by the film but noted that &quot;compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character can get on your nerves even if the actress doesn&#x27;t.&quot; Her performance earned her a London Critics&#x27; Circle Film Award. The film grossed $3 million worldwide.

In 1999, Beckinsale appeared opposite Claire Danes in &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;, a drama about two young Americans forced to deal with the Thai justice system on a post-graduation trip abroad. A then 26-year-old Beckinsale played a young girl. Danes had hoped to become friends with Beckinsale during the shoot but found her &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;prickly.&quot; McCarthy said the leads &quot;confirm their status as two of the young actresses on the scene today most worth watching,&quot; finding Beckinsale &quot;very effective at getting across layered character traits and emotions.&quot; &quot;Danes and Beckinsale are exceptionally talented young actresses,&quot; said Thomas, but &quot;unfortunately, the script&#x27;s seriously underdeveloped context defeats their considerable efforts at every turn.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Beckinsale&#x27;s character &quot;never comes into focus.&quot; The film was a box office failure.

2000&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; marked Beckinsale&#x27;s first role following the birth of her daughter. The Merchant/Ivory production was based on the novel by Henry James and also starred Uma Thurman and Jeremy Northam. Beckinsale&#x27;s partner, Michael Sheen, hit Northam on the film set after he followed Beckinsale to her trailer to scold her for forgetting a line. Holden noted &quot;the most satisfying of the four-lead performances belong to the British cast members, Ms. Beckinsale and Mr. Northam, who are better than their American counterparts at layers of emotional concealment,&quot; adding each beat of Beckinsale&#x27;s performance &quot;registers precisely.&quot; Thomas felt her performance would take her to &quot;a new career level.&quot; Andrew Sarris of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; asserted that she &quot;comes close to capturing the sublimity of Maggie, despite the obvious fact that no movie can capture the elegant copiousness of James&#x27; prose.&quot; The film grossed over $5 million worldwide.

Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with a leading role in the war film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: &quot;It&#x27;s so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It&#x27;s a big, sweeping epic...You just never get the chance to do that.&quot; Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut.&quot; He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn&#x27;t &quot;too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone&#x27;s too pretty.&quot; He asked her to lose weight during filming.

In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were &quot;upsetting&quot; and said she wore leather trousers because &quot;it was snowing out. It wasn&#x27;t exactly like I had my nipple rings in.&quot; She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: &quot;If I had come on to a movie set at [a younger] age and someone had said, &#x27;You&#x27;re a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?&#x27; – I might have jumped off a building. I just didn&#x27;t have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time.&quot; However, speaking in 2011, she said she was &quot;very fond&quot; of Bay.

&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised &quot;the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she&#x27;s like Parker Posey without irony.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;Mr. Affleck and Ms. Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars.&quot; However, Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; felt that the &quot;usually appealing Kate Beckinsale&quot; is &quot;inexplicably submerged – like her hospital colleagues – under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn&#x27;t wear.&quot; The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.

Beckinsale&#x27;s second film appearance of 2001 was in the romantic comedy &quot;Serendipity&quot;, as the love interest of John Cusack. It was filmed directly after &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and Beckinsale found it &quot;a real relief to return to something slightly more familiar.&quot; Turan praised the &quot;appealing and believable&quot; leads, adding that Beckinsale &quot;reinforces the strong impression she made in &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot;, and &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot;&quot; after &quot;recovering nicely&quot; from her appearance in the much-maligned &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; felt that &quot;Beckinsale&#x27;s talents haven&#x27;t been mined as effectively in any other film since &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;.&quot; McCarthy found her &quot;energetic and appealing&quot;. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as &quot;luminous but determined.&quot; In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Roger Ebert described her as &quot;a good actress, but not good enough to play this dumb.&quot; The film grossed over $77 million at the worldwide box office.

In 2002, Beckinsale starred in Lisa Cholodenko&#x27;s &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;, as a strait-laced academic who finds herself increasingly attracted to her free-spirited future mother-in-law. The independent film was another opportunity for Beckinsale to work with Christian Bale, her &quot;Prince of Jutland&quot; co‑star. She found their sex scene awkward because she knew Bale well: &quot;If it was a stranger, it would have been easier.&quot; While Frances McDormand&#x27;s performance as Bale&#x27;s mother was widely praised, Beckinsale received negative reviews. Holden found the film &quot;superbly acted, with the exception of Ms. Beckinsale, whose tense, colourless Alex conveys no inner life.&quot; Critic Lisa Schwarzbaum was unimpressed by the &quot;tedious&quot; characters and criticised &quot;the fussy performances of Bale and Beckinsale&quot; in particular. The film grossed over $4 million worldwide.

===2003–2006: Action roles===

Beckinsale became known as an action star after playing a vampire in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot;. The film was markedly different from her previous work, and Beckinsale has said she was grateful for the change of pace after appearing in &quot;a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies,&quot; adding that &quot;It was quite a challenge for me to play an action heroine and pull off all that training when [in real life] I can&#x27;t catch a ball if it&#x27;s coming my way.&quot; The film received negative to mixed reviews but was a surprise box-office hit and has gained a cult following. Also in 2003, she starred in the little seen &quot;Tiptoes&quot; with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey.

In 2004, Beckinsale starred in the action horror film &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. She was &quot;so surprised&quot; to be appearing in her second action film in two years. &quot;It just seemed like a very good role.&quot; Beckinsale had just separated from her long-term boyfriend Michael Sheen at the time of filming and appreciated the warm atmosphere created on set by director Stephen Sommers and co‑star Hugh Jackman: &quot;I really did find that working with people like Stephen and Hugh made it possible to get through what I was going through.&quot; The film grossed over $120 million at the US box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described her as &quot;a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker&#x27;s whimsy&quot;. Rex Reed of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; felt she was &quot;desperately in need of a new agent.&quot;

Also in 2004, Beckinsale portrayed Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Howard Hughes biopic &quot;The Aviator&quot;. Scorsese decided to cast Beckinsale because, &quot;I&#x27;ve always liked her. I&#x27;ve seen all her work, and I was glad that she agreed to audition.&quot; Beckinsale&#x27;s performance received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; said she played the part &quot;in full va-va-voom blossom&quot;. LaSalle felt that she manages &quot;to convince us that Ava was one of the great broads of all time.&quot; However, Clark described it as &quot;the one performance that doesn&#x27;t come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;Gardner&#x27;s rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role as if she was advertising perfume.&quot; The film grossed over $213 million worldwide.

In 2006, Beckinsale reprised her role as Selene in the successful vampire sequel &quot;&quot;, directed by her husband, Len Wiseman. It was the first time she had &quot;been involved with a movie from the moment it&#x27;s a germ of an idea right through the whole editing process.&quot; Her daughter had a small role as the younger Selene. The film was a box office success, grossing $111 million worldwide. Beckinsale&#x27;s second film appearance of 2006 was opposite Adam Sandler and Christopher Walken in &quot;Click&quot;, a comedy about an overworked family man who discovers a magical remote control that allows him to control time. The opportunity to play a mother &quot;was one of the things that was attractive to me&quot; about the part. It was highly profitable, grossing $237 million worldwide against a production budget of $82.5 million.

===2007–2008: Focus on small-scale drama===

Beckinsale then made a return to smaller-scale projects: &quot;My experience is that I sort of stepped away from the independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that&#x27;s not necessarily how it&#x27;s perceived by everybody else, which I do understand.&quot; &quot;I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [but] it&#x27;s not something that I would like to do solely.&quot; She explained that she had originally decided to appear in &quot;Underworld&quot; because she felt typecast in classical roles – it was &quot;assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers&quot; – but that her action career &quot;kind of took off a little too much.&quot;

In 2007, Beckinsale starred opposite Sam Rockwell in the independent drama &quot;Snow Angels&quot;, based on the novel by Stewart O&#x27;Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale &quot;in kind of a tough place.&quot; &quot;I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love.&quot; Puig felt &quot;Beckinsale gives her best performance in years&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; described it as &quot;her sharpest work yet.&quot; However, Scott felt that &quot;her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it&#x27;s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn.&quot; The film grossed solely $414,404 worldwide.
Also in 2007, Beckinsale appeared alongside Luke Wilson in &quot;Vacancy&quot;, a thriller set in an isolated motel. Sarah Jessica Parker was originally cast in the part, but she dropped out before filming began. Bradshaw felt &quot;Wilson and Beckinsale have the chops for scary movies&quot;. Gleiberman noted &quot;Luke Wilson, with his hangdog defensive mopiness, and Kate Beckinsale, all sexy severity, are ideally matched as a couple who hate each other.&quot; However, Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was unimpressed, referring to Beckinsale as &quot;the reigning queen of the bland B&#x27;s.&quot; The film was profitable, grossing $35 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million.

In 2008, Beckinsale appeared in &quot;Winged Creatures&quot;, a film about how six different witnesses cope with the aftermath of a shooting. Beckinsale played a waitressing single mother in an ensemble cast which included Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, and Forest Whitaker. &quot;It was a really, really nice experience but it was quick,&quot; said Beckinsale of the filming process. &quot;I just felt a bit like I was shot through a cannon.&quot; Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt she played the role &quot;with a white trash verve&quot; and found her character&#x27;s &quot;raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable.&quot; However, Dargis felt that Beckinsale and her cast mates have a &quot;tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clichés.&quot; The film received a very limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles; it was released simultaneously on DVD.

Also in 2008, Beckinsale starred in &quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot;, as a journalist who refuses to reveal her source. The film, co‑starring Vera Farmiga and Matt Dillon, was inspired by the case of Judith Miller. As part of her research for the role, &quot;I spent some time at &quot;The L.A. Times&quot; with some female reporters, and I spoke to Judith Miller about her experience...I really researched the hell out of that one and it was an amazingly fulfilling, brilliant experience.&quot; Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asserted that Beckinsale and Farmiga played &quot;two of the most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while, and they&#x27;ve been brought to life by two gifted actresses, each working at the top of her game.&quot; Beckinsale received a Critic&#x27;s Choice Award nomination for her performance. The film never received a full theatrical release after the distributor filed for bankruptcy and the film grossed solely $186,702 worldwide. &quot;I have prayed – &quot;prayed&quot; – for film companies to go bankrupt on films I&#x27;ve made, and then this happens on the one I love,&quot; said Beckinsale. &quot;Usually it&#x27;s the ones you&#x27;re most embarrassed about that are on the side of every bus.&quot;

===2009–2015: Return to action films===
In 2009, Beckinsale starred in the comic-book adaption &quot;Whiteout&quot;, as a US Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica. It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada. She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in &quot;Underworld&quot; because &quot;three pairs of trousers and a parka gives you a bit more protection than the latex suit.&quot; The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget. With critics consensus: Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold. She also made a brief cameo in the prequel &quot;&quot;; she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot;.

Also in 2009, Beckinsale starred in the family drama &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot; alongside Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, and Rockwell, her &quot;Snow Angels&quot; co-star. Beckinsale was excited by the opportunity to work with De Niro, whom she had first encountered &quot;years and years ago when I just had Lily and he was putting together a reading of &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;.&quot;. &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot; was a box office flop, failing to recoup its production budget. In May 2010, Beckinsale sat on the nine-member 2010 Cannes Film Festival jury, chaired by director Tim Burton. Unable to find a script she felt passionate about, Beckinsale kept a low profile in 2010 and 2011, opting to spend time with her daughter.

Beckinsale returned to acting in 2012 with appearances in three action films. Beckinsale first appeared in the action thriller &quot;Contraband&quot;. She had a supporting role as the wife of Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s character, a former criminal who gets forced back into a life of crime after his family members are threatened. The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who also starred in the Icelandic language version of the film, &quot;Reykjavík-Rotterdam&quot;. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt Beckinsale was &quot;stuck in a bit of a thankless role as the victimised wife, but she does try to infuse a harder edge to the character.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that &quot;Beckinsale, her innate classiness calibrated down a few notches, has little to do but be supportive, worried and, eventually, besieged.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that the &quot;woman-in-peril stuff is second-rate, giving off a whiff of exploitation&quot; while &quot;Variety&quot; found the repeated violence towards Beckinsale&#x27;s character disturbing. The film had a production budget of $25 million and grossed over $96 million worldwide.

Beckinsale next reprised her role as Selene in the fourth instalment of the vampire franchise &quot;&quot;. The franchise was initially conceived of as a trilogy and Beckinsale was not &quot;intending to do another one&quot; but was convinced by the quality of the script. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted that &quot;when she&#x27;s not actually fighting, her performance consists of little more than striding purposefully toward or away from the camera.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that she &quot;finally manages to perfect the monotone delivery she&#x27;d been honing for the series&#x27; first two entries.&quot; The film had a production budget of $70 million and grossed over $160 million worldwide.

Also in 2012, Beckinsale appeared as the wife of a factory worker in the sci-fi action remake &quot;Total Recall&quot;, directed by her husband Len Wiseman. She has said Wiseman joined the project because he was unable to receive studio financing for an original sci-fi idea: &quot;You&#x27;re constantly finding yourself having to defend doing a remake when you didn&#x27;t really want to make one in the first place.&quot; The film received mainly negative reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; found her performance &quot;one-note&quot; while &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described her as &quot;one-dimensional.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; remarked that she &quot;spends much of the movie strutting down hallways and looking relentlessly, though blandly, nasty.&quot; The film grossed $198 million against a production budget of over $125 million. In 2012, she appeared alongside Judy Greer and Andrea Savage in the Funny or Die video &quot;Republicans, Get in My Vagina&quot;, a satire of the Republican Party&#x27;s policies concerning abortion and prenatal care.

In 2013, Beckinsale starred in the legal thriller &quot;The Trials of Cate McCall&quot; opposite Nick Nolte and James Cromwell. The film received negative reviews and was released as a Lifetime movie. She next appeared in the little-seen psychological thriller &quot;Stonehearst Asylum&quot;, loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether.&quot; A lukewarm critical reception greeted the film upon its DVD release; Jeannette Catsoulis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Beckinsale was &quot;emoting as if an Oscar nomination depended on it&quot; while Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; found her performance &quot;overwrought.&quot; In 2014, she provided the voice for Queen Ayrenn, a character in &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot; video game.

Also in 2014, Beckinsale starred in the psychological thriller &quot;The Face of an Angel&quot; alongside Daniel Brühl. The film, directed by Michael Winterbottom, was inspired by the case of Meredith Kercher. Jesse Hassenger of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt her &quot;charismatic&quot; performance was wasted. Also in 2015, she starred alongside Simon Pegg in the poorly received British comedy &quot;Absolutely Anything&quot;, as an author agency employee and the love interest of a man (Pegg) chosen by four aliens to do anything he wants. Tom Huddleston of &quot;Time Out&quot; said her character &quot;is never really developed – which is perhaps a blessing, because her cut-glass-posh performance is almost as grating as Pegg&#x27;s.&quot; A fan of Monty Python growing up, in 2014 Beckinsale appeared on the fourth episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Best Bits (Mostly)&quot; where she spoke of her favourite Python comedy sketch.

===2016–present: &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot; and beyond===

In the 2016 romantic comedy &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Beckinsale reunited with her &quot;Last Days of Disco&quot; collaborators Stillman and Sevigny. Based on Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, the film revolved around her role as the title character, a wry and calculating widow, as she pursues a wealthy and hapless man for marriage originally intended for her daughter, though she eventually marries him herself. The film was universally acclaimed by critics and found commercial success in arthouse cinemas. Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; described the role as &quot;one of the most satisfying screen roles of her career [...] Beckinsale magnetizes the screen in a way that naturally underscores how far ahead of everyone else she is: an effect that doesn&#x27;t always work to the movie&#x27;s advantage.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; remarked, &quot;There aren&#x27;t great depths to the role, but Beckinsale excels with the long speeches and in defining her character as a very self-aware egoist.&quot;

Also in the year, she starred in the horror film &quot;The Disappointments Room&quot;, opposite Mel Raido, both playing a couple in a new house that contains a hidden room with a haunted past. The film was heavily panned by critics and flopped at the box office; it only made $1.4 million in its opening weekend, and a total of $2.4 million in North America. Christian Holub of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; concluded that &quot;[m]ost of the film is just Beckinsale walking around looking worried&quot;, while Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; found her &quot;credible and compelling [...] except for when she&#x27;s trying way too hard in a rather unfortunate scene that calls for drunken ranting.&quot; In late 2016, Beckinsale returned as Selene in the fifth instalment of the &quot;Underworld&quot; franchise, &quot;&quot;, which grossed $81.1 million worldwide.

Beckinsale starred opposite Pierce Brosnan, Callum Turner, and Jeff Bridges in Marc Webb&#x27;s romantic coming-of-age drama &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; (2017), as a book editor and the mistress of a publisher whose son sees his life upended. Reviews of the film were mediocre, while it found a limited audience in theatres. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; found Brosnan and Beckinsale to be &quot;vastly more interesting by the twin virtues of not disguising their voices and fitting so poorly into the sad-faced melodrama this movie wants to be&quot;. She is attached to star in an adaptation of &quot;The Chocolate Money&quot; by Ashley Prentice Norton, with a screenplay by Emma Forrest. In 2018, Beckinsale starred as Ingrid Carpenter in the British film &quot;Farming&quot;.

Beckinsale starred in the ITV/Amazon Prime drama &quot;The Widow&quot; (2019), her first TV series for more than 20 years. The series stars Beckinsale as an Englishwoman who believes her husband, killed in a plane crash three years prior, is still alive in the Congo. Beckinsale starred in the American action comedy film &quot;Jolt&quot; alongside Bobby Cannavale, Laverne Cox, Stanley Tucci and Jai Courtney. &quot;Jolt&quot; was adapted from a screenplay by Scott Wascha and directed by Tanya Wexler and released by Amazon Studios on 23 July 2021. That same year she starred in the Paramount+ dark comedy streaming television &quot;Guilty Party&quot;. In that series, she served as executive producer as well.

In 2021, Deadline announced that Beckinsale would star in the Catherine Hardwicke directed family drama &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

===Modelling===
Labelled an &quot;English rose&quot; by the BBC as early as 2001, Beckinsale has worked occasionally as a model. In 1997, she appeared in the music video for George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Waltz Away Dreaming&quot;. She starred opposite Orlando Bloom in a 2002 Gap television advertisement directed by Cameron Crowe. She appeared in a Diet Coke television advertisement in 2004, directed by Michel Gondry. She advertised Absolut Vodka in a 2009 print campaign photographed by Ellen von Unwerth.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Beckinsale was in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Sheen from 1995 to 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of &quot;The Seagull&quot; in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards. In 1997, they voiced an audiobook production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Their daughter Lily Mo Sheen was born in 1999. In 2001, Beckinsale said she was &quot;embarrassed&quot; that Sheen never proposed, but felt as though she was married. They broke up in early 2003, after the filming of &quot;Underworld&quot;. Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends.
She remarked in 2016, &quot;He&#x27;s really dear, close family. He&#x27;s somebody I&#x27;ve known since I was 21 years old. I really love him a lot.&quot;

Beckinsale met American director Len Wiseman while working together on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot;. She persuaded Wiseman to cast Sheen in the film, but while on set, Beckinsale and Wiseman fell in love. Wiseman&#x27;s then-wife Dana, a kindergarten teacher, accused her husband of infidelity with Beckinsale. Beckinsale and Wiseman married on 9 May 2004 in Bel-Air, California. They separated in November 2015. Wiseman filed for divorce in 2016, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Their divorce was finalised in November 2019. Beckinsale briefly dated American comedian Matt Rife in 2017 and 2018 while she was still married.

In January 2019, Beckinsale was reported to be dating American comedian Pete Davidson. In April they &quot;called time on their romance.&quot;

===Personal and political beliefs===
Beckinsale is a smoker. When she was nine, her mother moved in with Roy Battersby, and his sons introduced her to cigarettes.

She is a teetotaller, stating in 2003, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been drunk even. I&#x27;ve never taken drugs. I&#x27;ve never had a one-night-stand.&quot;

In 2007, she appeared alongside David Schwimmer in the sixth of the Writers Guild of America member-conceived Internet videos for Project &quot;Speechless,&quot; in support of the WGA labour strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture &amp; Television Producers.

In 2012, she appeared alongside Judy Greer and Andrea Savage in the Funny or Die video &quot;Republicans, Get in My Vagina,&quot; a satire of the Republican Party&#x27;s policies concerning abortion and prenatal care.

===Legal issues===
In July 2003, the Press Complaints Commission dismissed a complaint filed by Beckinsale. She alleged that the tabloid &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had invaded her and her daughter&#x27;s privacy by publishing photographs of the actress embracing and kissing her then-boyfriend Len Wiseman. The article in question was headlined, &quot;Mummy&#x27;s latest love scene leaves Lily unimpressed&quot; and included a picture in which her then-four-year-old daughter appeared to be ignoring her mother&#x27;s romantic actions. The Commission found that &quot;the photographs had been taken in a public place and did not reveal any private details about Lilysuch as her health or schoolingbut were restricted to general observations about her apparent reaction to her surroundings.&quot;

In August 2003, Beckinsale received a published apology from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; after it claimed that she had &quot;spent time in a clinic&quot; following her break-up with Michael Sheen. The apology was issued after she filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission. In 2009, Beckinsale was awarded () in damages by the British High Court after taking legal action against &quot;Express Newspapers&quot;. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; had falsely reported that she was &quot;facing heartbreak&quot; after losing out on a role in a remake of &quot;Barbarella&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
The British Heart Foundation has been Beckinsale&#x27;s charity of choice &quot;ever since [she] was six years old&quot; when her father, who had coronary artery disease, died of a massive heart attack. She has also donated film memorabilia to the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation, MediCinema, Habitat For Humanity and the Entertainment Industry Foundation. In 2008, she hosted the 4th Annual Pink Party to raise funds for the Women&#x27;s Cancer Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and organised a screening of &quot;All About Eve&quot; for FilmAid International. In 2012, Beckinsale joined Nestlé&#x27;s Share the Joy of Reading Program to raise awareness about the importance of people&#x27;s literacy.

=== Availability ===
Except for her two appearances on the 1975 British daytime marriage counseling drama &quot;Couples&quot;, which was made before the BBC began to archive all of its productions and so may no longer exist, all of Beckinsale&#x27;s recorded performances are publicly available on various media. The vast majority are available in high definition.

The domestic theatrical cut of &quot;Shooting Fish&quot; contains a few minutes cut from the international release. Only the original UK VHS release includes these scenes on home media; the UK VHS rerelease and all DVD and streaming releases are of the shorter international cut.

The early DVD releases of &quot;Underworld&quot; feature two audio commentaries; one artistic and the other technical. The latter was dropped from all subsequent DVD releases and never released on Blu-ray.

&quot;Guilty Party&quot; was originally available in 4K Dolby Vision on Paramount+ but is now available, after a period of official unavailability, only in 1080p SDR through other services, and has not been released on physical media.

Her narrations of &quot;Emma,&quot; &quot;Emma &amp; Knightley: Perfect Happiness in Highbury,&quot; and &quot;Bold Little Tiger&quot; were released only on cassette.

The dramatization of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in which she plays Juliet was released on cassette and remains available on CD and digitally through Audible and the Naxos Spoken Word Library.

Her narration of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is available exclusively as a digital audiobook through Apple Books.

PIDAX released the complete series of &quot;Anna Lee&quot; (including &quot;Headcase&quot;) on DVD in 2021, but only with a German dub, without the original English audio.

&quot;Rachel&#x27;s Dream,&quot; &quot;Anna Lee&quot; with its original English audio, &quot;Marie-Louise ou la permission,&quot; and &quot;The Proposal&quot; haven&#x27;t been released on home media but can be found on YouTube or the Internet Archive.

All television advertisements and web shorts in which she has appeared in can be viewed on YouTube.

Her five stage performances are not known to have been recorded, although a few photographs exist.

<text>Albert Richard Smith (24 May 181623 May 1860) was an English author, entertainer, and mountaineer.

==Biography==

===Literary career===
Smith was born at Chertsey, Surrey. The son of a surgeon, he studied medicine in London and in Paris, and his first literary effort was an account of his life in Paris, which appeared in the &quot;Mirror&quot;. He gradually abandoned his medical work in favour of writing. Though a journalist rather than a literary figure, he was one of the most popular writers of his time, and a favourite humorist. He was one of the early contributors to &quot;Punch&quot; 1842, and was also a regular contributor to Richard Bentley&#x27;s &quot;Miscellany&quot;, in whose pages his first and best book, the novel &quot;The Adventures of Mr Ledbury&quot;, appeared in 1842. His other novels were &quot;The Fortunes of the Scattergood Family&quot; (1845), &quot;The Marchioness of Brinvilliers: The Poisoner of the Seventeenth Century&quot; (1846), &quot;The Struggles and Adventures of Christopher Tadpole&quot; (1848), and &quot;The Pottleton Legacy: A Story of Town and Country&quot; (1849). He also published a novella, &quot;The Adventures of Jack Holiday, with Something about His Sister&quot; (1844).
In 1842 Smith&#x27;s first play, &quot;Blanche Heriot, or The Chertsey Curfew&quot;, was produced at the Surrey Theatre. In 1843 he published &quot;The Wassail-Bowl: A Comic Christmas Sketchbook&quot;, which included a short story on the same subject as his play of the year before, &quot;Blanche Heriot: A Legend of Old Chertsey Church&quot;. He also wrote a series of so-called natural histories: &quot;The Gent&quot; (1847), &quot;The Ballet Girl&quot; (1847), &quot;&#x27;Stuck-Up&#x27; People&quot; (1847), &quot;The Idler upon Town&quot; (1848) and &quot;The Flirt&quot; (1848). Smith wrote several extravaganzas for the Lyceum Theatre, including &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1844), &quot;Valentine and Orson&quot; (1844) and &quot;Whittington and His Cat&quot; (1845), and adapted for the same theatre Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; (1845) and &quot;The Battle of Life&quot; (1846). With Angus Bethune Reach he founded and edited a monthly magazine called &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;, which ran from January 1847 to June 1849.

===Travels and mountaineering===

In 1849 Smith went on a tour to Constantinople and the Near East. On his return he published &quot;A Month at Constantinople&quot;, and shortly afterwards he appeared at Willis&#x27;s Rooms in a public entertainment about his travels called &quot;The Overland Mail&quot;, which proved a hit. He mentioned of the city &quot;I had never been so strongly moved before but once - when I looked down upon London, by night, from a balloon&quot;. In August 1851 he ascended Mont Blanc. The year after he published a book about his adventures, &quot;The Story of Mont Blanc&quot;, and produced at the Egyptian Hall an entertainment called &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;, describing the ascent of the mountain and the Englishman abroad, which became the most popular exhibition of the kind ever known. In May 1854 he gave his performance before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Osborne House. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Mont Blanc&quot; show ran for 2000 performances over six years and helped to popularize mountain climbing in mid-Victorian Britain. He was one of the founder members of the Alpine Club in 1857. In July 1858 Smith traveled to Hong Kong. On his return he published &quot;To China and Back&quot; (1859), and in December 1858 he commenced at the Egyptian Hall a third entertainment, called &quot;Mont Blanc to China&quot;, which was also very popular.

In 2019, the QC Terme wellness centre opened a sauna named after Albert Smith as a tribute to his work in inspiring people to visit Chamonix.

===Family===
In 1859 Smith married Mary Lucy Keeley (circa 1830–1870), who had been an actress and was the elder daughter of the comedian Robert Keeley and the distinguished actress Mary Anne Keeley. In 1860 he died from bronchitis in Fulham, London, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. Smith received great help from his brother, Arthur W.W. Smith (1825–1861), who had also been educated in medicine and who managed the entertainments at the Egyptian Hall from 1852 to 1860. Arthur also planned Charles Dickens&#x27;s readings in 1858, and made arrangements for a second series, but died before they were completed.

<doc id="277730" wikidata="Q603292" url="?curid=277730" title="Little John">
<text>Little John is a companion of Robin Hood who serves as his chief lieutenant and second-in-command of the Merry Men. He is one of only a handful of consistently named characters who relate to Robin Hood and one of the two oldest Merry Men, alongside Much the Miller&#x27;s Son. His name is an ironic reference to his giant frame, as he is usually portrayed in legend as a huge warrior – a master of the quarterstaff. In folklore, he fought Robin Hood on a tree bridge across a river on their first meeting.

==Folklore==
The first known reference in English verse to Robin Hood is found in The Vision of Piers Plowman, written by William Langland in the second part of the 14th century. Little John appears in the earliest recorded Robin Hood ballads and stories, and in one of the earliest references to Robin Hood by Andrew of Wyntoun in 1420 and by Walter Bower in 1440. In the early tales, Little John is shown to be intelligent and highly capable. In &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;, he captures the sorrowful knight and, when Robin Hood decides to pay the knight&#x27;s mortgage for him, accompanies him as a servant. In &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Death&quot;, he is the only one of the Merry Men that Robin takes with him. In the 15th-century ballad commonly called &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot;, Little John leaves in anger after a dispute with Robin. When Robin Hood is captured, it is Little John who plans his leader&#x27;s rescue. In thanks, Robin offers Little John leadership of the band, but John refuses. Later depictions of Little John portray him as less cunning.

The earliest ballads do not feature an origin story for this character. According to a 17th-century ballad, he was at least seven feet tall and introduced when he tried to prevent Robin from crossing a narrow bridge, whereupon they fought with quarterstaves, and Robin was overcome. Despite having won the duel, John agreed to join his band and fight alongside him. From then on he was called Little John in whimsical reference to his size. This scene is almost always re-enacted in film and television versions of the story. In some modern film versions, Little John loses the duel to Robin.
Starting from the ballad tradition, Little John is commonly shown to be the only Merry Man present at Robin Hood&#x27;s death.

Despite a lack of historical evidence for his existence, Little John is reputed to be buried in a churchyard in the village of Hathersage, Derbyshire. A modern tombstone marks the supposed location of his grave, which lies under an old yew tree. This grave was owned by the Nailor (Naylor) family, and sometimes some variation of &quot;Nailer&quot; is given as John&#x27;s surname. In other versions of the legends, his name is given as John Little, losing the irony of his nickname.

According to local legend, Little John built himself a small cottage across the River Derwent from the family home. The site now has a 15th century Grade 2 listed ex-farmhouse and barn built on it, called Nether House at Offerton.

In Dublin, a local legend suggests that Little John visited the city in the 12th century and was hanged there.

==Film and television==

Alan Hale, Sr. played the role of Little John in three movies. He first played Little John as a young squire in 1922&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; starring Douglas Fairbanks. He reprised the role opposite Errol Flynn&#x27;s Robin in 1938&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. And finally, he played an older Little John opposite John Derek, as Robin&#x27;s son, in &quot;Rogues of Sherwood Forest&quot; from 1951.

Other notable film and TV Little Johns include Archie Duncan in the 1950s TV series, Nicol Williamson in &quot;Robin and Marian&quot;, James Robertson Justice in the 1952 Disney film &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot;, Clive Mantle in the 1980s TV series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, Bin Shimada as the voice of Little John in the anime series &quot;Robin Hood no Daibōken&quot;, Terrence Scammell as the voice of Little John in the animated series &quot;Young Robin Hood&quot;, Phil Harris as the voice of Little John the Bear in the 1973 Disney animated film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, David Morrissey in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and Nick Brimble in &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; – both in 1991, and Eric Allan Kramer in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;.

Kevin Durand plays John in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. In this incarnation, he is a Scottish foot soldier in the Crusades who fights Robin over a lost bet, claiming he was cheating, then joins Robin, Will, and Alan when the king is killed. 

In the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, Little John was played by Gordon Kennedy. John meets Robin when his band of outlaws steals from Robin&#x27;s band. John also has a wife, Alice, and a son, both of whom believe he is dead until late in the first series. He dislikes Robin immediately but has a change of heart after Robin makes a stand to protect John&#x27;s wife and son. When the sheriff attempts to interrogate the villagers of Loxley on Robin&#x27;s whereabouts by cutting out their tongues, Robin surrenders just as they are threatening Alice, thus sparing her. While Robin is awaiting execution, John discreetly meets his son, who mentions how Robin helped him and his mother, and the rest of the village by feeding them all. This causes John to lead the others to Nottingham Castle to rescue Robin, after which John and Robin become good friends. John is the oldest of the outlaws and fights with a quarterstaff.

He was portrayed by Jason Burkart in the TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot;.

Jamie Foxx portrayed John in the 2018 movie &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. In contrast to most versions of John, this version is officially known as &#x27;Yahya&#x27;- which he says translates to &#x27;John&#x27;- and is originally Muslim fighting against Robin when they meet in battle during the Crusades, with this first encounter resulting in Yahya&#x27;s left hand being cut off. However, when he sees Robin try to save his son from being executed by Sir Gisborne, he stows away on a ship taking Robin back to England with the goal of helping Robin take up an opposing role to the Crusades. Despite the loss of his left hand making it impossible for him to use a bow, he is still a skilled enough fighter to intercept Robin&#x27;s arrows with only his staff and soon adapts to the use of his metal-clad stump as another weapon in combat.

In the British television show &quot;Fact or Fiction&quot;, episode 4, hosted by Tony Robinson, it is postulated that &quot;Little John&quot; is in actuality Reynolde Greenleaf from near Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

== Analysis ==
Little John has been argued to play a crucial role in illustrating the ties between the servant and the master, and his actions can be seen as challenging the power hierarchy of the depicted society.

<text>Berry Gordy III (born November 28, 1929), also known as Berry Gordy Jr., is an American retired record executive, record producer, songwriter, film producer and television producer. He is best known as the founder of the Motown record label and its subsidiaries, which was the highest-earning African-American business for decades.

As a songwriter, Gordy composed or co-composed a number of hits including &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Why&quot; (Jackie Wilson), &quot;Shop Around&quot; (the Miracles), and &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; (the Contours), all of which topped the US R&amp;B charts, as well as the international hit &quot;Reet Petite&quot; (Jackie Wilson). As part of the Corporation, he wrote many hit songs for the Jackson 5, including &quot;I Want You Back&quot; and &quot;ABC&quot;. As a record producer, he launched the Miracles and signed acts like the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, and Stevie Wonder. He was known for carefully directing the public image, dress, manners, and choreography of his acts.

Gordy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama in 2016, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2021. In 2022, he was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

== Early years ==
Berry Gordy III (also known as Berry Gordy Jr.) was born on November 28, 1929, in Detroit, the seventh of the eight children of Berry Gordy II (also known as Berry Gordy Sr.) and Bertha Fuller Gordy, who had relocated to Detroit from Oconee, Washington County, Georgia, in 1922.

His grandfather, named Berry Gordy I, was the son of James Gordy, a white plantation owner in Georgia, and one of his slaves. Berry I&#x27;s half-brother, James (son of the elder James and his legal wife), was the grandfather of President Jimmy Carter. Berry Gordy II was led to Detroit both by the job opportunities offered by the booming automotive businesses, and also by worries over the atmosphere in the American South, where black men were lynched &quot;with chilling regularity by the Ku Klux Klan&quot;; in the first twenty years of the twentieth century, 1,502 lynchings were reported, most in Southern states. Gordy&#x27;s father opened a grocery store, owned a plastering and carpentry business, and a printing shop. While his brothers Fuller and George were happy to work at jobs their father assigned to them in construction and printing, Gordy and his brother Robert were less inclined to follow that path; both liked dancing and music, but Gordy&#x27;s greatest interest was in boxing.

Gordy dropped out of Northeastern High School in the eleventh grade to become a professional boxer in hopes of becoming rich quickly; he boxed professionally until 1950, when he was drafted by the United States Army in 1951 for service in the Korean War. Arriving in Korea in May 1952, Gordy was first assigned to the 58th Field Artillery Battalion, 3rd Infantry Division, near Panmunjom. He later became a chaplain&#x27;s assistant, driving a jeep and playing the organ at religious services at the front. His tour in the Korean War was completed in April 1953. He obtained a GED, which is equivalent to a high school diploma.

After his return from Korea in 1953, he married 19-year-old Thelma Louise Coleman in Toledo, Ohio. Gordy developed his interest in music by writing songs and opening the 3-D Record Mart, a record store featuring jazz music and 3-D glasses. The store was unsuccessful, and Gordy sought work at the Lincoln-Mercury plant, but his family connections put him in touch with Al Green (no relation to the singer Reverend Al Green), owner of the Flame Show Bar Talent Club, where he met the singer Jackie Wilson.

In 1957, Wilson recorded &quot;Reet Petite&quot;, a song Gordy had co-written with his sister Gwen and writer-producer Billy Davis. It became a modest hit, but had more success internationally, especially in the UK, where it reached the Top 10 and even later topped the chart on re-issue in 1986. Wilson recorded six more songs co-written by Gordy over the next two years, including &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot;, which topped the R&amp;B charts and got to number 7 in the pop chart. The Gordy siblings and Davis also wrote &quot;All I Could Do Was Cry&quot; for Etta James at Chess Records.

== Motown Record Corporation ==

Gordy reinvested the profits from his songwriting success into producing. In 1957, he discovered the Miracles (originally known as the Matadors) and began building a portfolio of successful artists. In 1959, with the encouragement of Miracles leader Smokey Robinson, Gordy borrowed $800 () from his family to create an R&amp;B record company. Originally, Gordy wanted to name the new label Tammy Records, after the song recorded by Debbie Reynolds. However, that name was taken, and he chose the name Tamla Records. The company began operating on January 12, 1959. &quot;Come to Me&quot; by Marv Johnson was issued as Tamla 101. United Artists Records picked up &quot;Come to Me&quot; for national distribution, as well as Johnson&#x27;s more successful follow-up records such as &quot;You Got What It Takes&quot;, co-produced by Gordy, who also received a co-writer credit, though the song was originally written and recorded by guitarist Bobby Parker for Vee-Jay Records a year and a half earlier. Gordy&#x27;s next release was the only 45 ever issued on his Rayber label, featuring Wade Jones with an unnamed female backup group. The record did not sell well and is now one of the rarest issues from the Motown stable. Berry&#x27;s third release was &quot;Bad Girl&quot; by the Miracles, the first release on the Motown record label. &quot;Bad Girl&quot; was a solid hit in 1959 after Chess Records picked it up. Barrett Strong&#x27;s &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot; initially appeared on Tamla and then charted on Gordy&#x27;s sister&#x27;s label, Anna Records, in February 1960. It was the Miracles who gave the label its first million-selling hit single, with the 1960 &quot;Grammy Hall of Fame&quot; smash, &quot;Shop Around&quot; and this song, and its follow up hits, &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; (another Grammy Hall of Fame-inducted hit), &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Monkey&quot;,&quot;What&#x27;s So Good About Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Something New&quot;, made the Miracles the label&#x27;s first stars.

The Tamla and Motown labels were then merged into a new company, Motown Record Corporation, incorporated on April 14, 1960. In 1960, Gordy signed an unknown singer, Mary Wells, who became the fledgling label&#x27;s second star, with Smokey Robinson penning her hits &quot;You Beat Me to the Punch&quot;, &quot;Two Lovers&quot;, and &quot;My Guy&quot;. The Miracles&#x27; hit &quot;Shop Around&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the national R&amp;B charts in late 1960 and at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine pop charts on January 16, 1961 (No. 1 pop, &quot;Cash Box&quot;), which established Motown as an independent company worthy of notice. Later in 1961, the Marvelettes&#x27; &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; made it to the top of both charts.
Gordy&#x27;s gift for identifying and bringing together musical talent, along with the careful management of his artists&#x27; public image, made Motown a major national and then international success. Over the next decade, he signed such artists as the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Jimmy Ruffin, the Contours, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, the Commodores, the Velvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, Stevie Wonder and the Jackson 5. Though he also signed some white acts to the label (Rare Earth and Rustix, via the Rare Earth label), Gordy mainly promoted African-American artists but carefully controlled their public image, dress, manners and choreography for across-the-board appeal.

== Relocation to Los Angeles ==
In 1972, Gordy relocated to Los Angeles, where he produced the commercially successful biographical drama film on Billie Holiday, &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, starring Diana Ross (who was nominated for an Academy Award), Richard Pryor, and Billy Dee Williams (cast in a role originally for Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops). Initially the studio, over Gordy&#x27;s objections, rejected Williams after several screen tests. However, Gordy, known for his tenacity, eventually prevailed, and the film established Williams as a major movie star. Berry Gordy soon after produced and directed &quot;Mahogany&quot; (Tony Richardson was the original director, but Gordy fired Richardson and took over direction himself after a dispute over minor casting), also starring Ross and Williams. In 1985, he produced the cult martial arts film &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;, which starred martial artist Taimak and one of Prince&#x27;s proteges, Vanity.

Although Motown continued to produce major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s by artists including the Jacksons, Rick James, Commodores, Lionel Richie, and long-term signings Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson, the record company was no longer the major force it had been. Gordy sold his interests in Motown Records to MCA and Boston Ventures on June 28, 1988, for $61 million (). He later sold most of his interests in Jobete publishing to EMI Publishing. Gordy wrote or co-wrote 240 of the approximately 15,000 songs in Motown&#x27;s Jobete music catalogue. However, the true test of the label&#x27;s worth would come a few years later, when Polygram paid over $330 million (Diana Ross was given shares in this version of the label) for the Motown catalog.

Gordy published an autobiography, &quot;To Be Loved&quot;, in 1994.

== Awards and accolades ==

Gordy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. In 1993 he received the CBC Lifetime Achievement Award. He was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2009.

When Gordy received the Songwriters Hall of Fame&#x27;s Pioneer Award on June 13, 2013, he was the first living individual to receive the honor.

In 2014, Gordy received the key to the city from Mike Duggan on October 22, 2014.

In 2016, Gordy received the National Medal of Arts from President Obama for &quot;helping to create a trailblazing new sound in American music. As a record producer and songwriter, he helped build Motown, launching the music careers of countless legendary artists. His unique sound helped shape our Nation&#x27;s story.&quot;

Berry Gordy Square in Los Angeles was designated by the City Council at intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Argyle where the office of Motown was located.

In 2021, he was awarded the Kennedy Center Honors alongside Bette Midler, Joni Mitchell, Justino Díaz, and Lorne Michaels.

In 2022, he was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

In 2022, he was awarded with an honorary doctorate from the University of Michigan.

== Statements about Motown artists ==
Following the funeral of Marvin Gaye on April 5, 1984, Gordy declared Gaye &quot;the greatest of his time.&quot; Berry said the singer &quot;had no musical equals,&quot; while also discussing how he carried on the legacy of other soul singers who tackled a range of themes, from love to civil rights, such as Billie Holiday.

On March 20, 2009, Gordy was in Hollywood to pay tribute to his first group and first million-selling act, the Miracles, when the members received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Speaking in tribute to the group, Gordy said: &quot;Without the Miracles, Motown would not be the Motown it is today.&quot;

At the age of 79, Gordy spoke at the memorial service for Michael Jackson in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. He suggested that &quot;The King of Pop&quot; was perhaps not the best description for Jackson in light of his achievements, referring to him instead as &quot;the greatest entertainer that ever lived.&quot;

==&quot;Motown: The Musical&quot;==
On May 15, 2011, it was announced that Gordy was developing a Broadway musical about Motown. The show is said to be an account of events of the 1960s and how they shaped the creation of the label. Gordy hoped that the musical would improve the reputation of Motown Records and clear up any misconceptions regarding the label&#x27;s demise.

&quot;&quot; began previews at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on March 11, 2013, and began regular performances there on April 14.
The musical closed in January 2015.

The UK version of &quot;Motown: The Musical&quot; opened in London&#x27;s West End in January 2016. Berry Gordy was present at the opening night.

== Personal life ==

Gordy, who was married and divorced three times, has eight children with six different women. His publishing company, Jobete, was named after his three eldest children: Joy, Berry and Terry.

He had three children with his first wife, Thelma Coleman, whom he married in 1953 (they were divorced in 1959):
* Hazel Joy Gordy (born August 24, 1954), was once married to Jermaine Jackson
* Berry Gordy IV (born October 1955), father to Skyler Austen Gordy
* Terry James Gordy (born August 1956)

In the spring of 1960 he married Raynoma Mayberry Liles (they were divorced in 1964). They had one son:
* Kerry Gordy (born June 25, 1959)
With Jeana Jackson, Gordy had one daughter:
* Sherry Gordy (born May 23, 1963)
With his then-mistress Margaret Norton, Gordy had a son:
* Kennedy William Gordy (born March 15, 1964); would later become known as the Motown musician Rockwell
Gordy had a biological daughter with Motown artist Diana Ross, with whom he had an intimate relationship from 1965 through 1970:
* Rhonda Suzanne (born August 14, 1971); her legal father is Robert Ellis Silberstein under California family law
Gordy&#x27;s eighth and youngest child is a son born to Nancy Leiviska:
* Stefan Kendal Gordy (born September 3, 1975); he is known by his stage name, Redfoo, as one member of the duo LMFAO (the other member is Skyler Gordy, born August 23, 1986, known professionally as SkyBlu; he is the grandson of Gordy and Thelma Coleman through their son Berry IV and his wife, Valerie Robeson)

Berry married Grace Eaton on July 17, 1990; they divorced in 1993.

He is also related to former US President Jimmy Carter. His relation to Carter stems from his white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy who owned a black, female slave named Esther Johnson.

A sexual assault lawsuit filed against Jermaine Jackson in December 2023 by Rita Barrett, who was the wife of Gordy&#x27;s friend Ben Barrett, alleged Gordy assisted in covering up Jackson&#x27;s sexual assault of her in 1988.

== Vistas Stables ==
Berry Gordy owned the colt Powis Castle whom he raced under the &quot;nom de course&quot; Vistas Stables. Racing in California, Powis Castle won the 1994 Oceanside Stakes and Malibu Stakes then finished 8th in the Kentucky Derby and 9th in the Preakness Stakes, the first two legs of the U.S. Triple Crown series.

== Film ==
=== Broadway ===
== In popular culture ==
* Gordy was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams (whose career Gordy had helped to jump-start in the 1970s) in the 1992 miniseries &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot;.
* Gordy was portrayed by Obba Babatunde in the 1998 miniseries &quot;The Temptations&quot;. He also plays a key role in &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud&quot;, which tells the story of The Temptations in a musical format. 
* The character Gordy Berry (also played by Babatunde) in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; is a reference to Berry Gordy.
* The character of Curtis Taylor Jr., a music executive in the 2006 musical film &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, has been described as &quot;appeared to be patterned after him.&quot; The film was based on the 1981 musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, but the film made the connection to Gordy and Motown much more explicit than the musical did, by, among other things, moving the setting of the story from Chicago to Detroit. Taylor appears in the film as unethical and insensitive to his artists, which caused Gordy and others to criticize the film after its release. Gordy called the portrayal &quot;100% wrong,&quot; while Smokey Robinson said it &quot;blatantly painted a negative picture of Motown and Berry Gordy and of the Supremes.&quot;
* Gordy was portrayed by Brandon Victor Dixon in the 2013 stage play production &quot;Motown: The Musical&quot;.

<text>Barry Andrews (born 12 September 1956 in West Norwood, London) is an English songwriter, singer and keyboard player who is a co-founder of Shriekback and was formerly a member of XTC and the League of Gentlemen.

==Early life==
Barry William Andrews was born in West Norwood, London, on 12 September, 1956, the only child of bricklayer William Andrews and Minnie, a housewife. Andrews attended Hitherfield Primary School in South-East London before moving with his family to Park North, Swindon, at the age of seven. He attended Park North Junior School, Richard Jefferies Secondary School and Park Senior High School, leaving full-time education in 1976.

==Career==
On leaving school, Andrews played keyboards in covers bands in Swindon and Exeter before joining XTC in 1978. He played on the band’s first two albums, &quot;White Music&quot; and &quot;Go 2&quot;, before leaving in 1979. That same year, he recorded the solo EP &quot;Town and Country&quot; (Virgin) and played on Iggy Pop’s &quot;Soldier&quot; (Arista) with David Bowie, Ivan Král, Glen Matlock, Klaus Krüger and Steve New.

In 1980 he recorded the single &quot;Rossmore Road/Win a Night Out with a Well-Known Paranoiac&quot; on Virgin. Also in 1980, Andrews joined Robert Fripp&#x27;s The League of Gentlemen with Sara Lee and Jonny TooBad. They recorded one album for E.G. Records before Fripp dismissed the band. Andrews then formed Restaurant for Dogs with Kevin Wilkinson, Dave Marx and Bruce McRae. Latterly Clare Hirst, Sara Lee and Carlo Asciutti joined the band.

In 1981, Andrews met up with bassist Dave Allen who had recently left Gang of Four and the pair, along with guitarist/vocalist Carl Marsh, formed Shriekback. Shriekback have been active for 41 years, recording 17 studio albums. 

In 2003, Andrews began releasing solo projects through his own Shriekprods label. These form two main strands: the Haunted Box of Switches series of piano and voice albums which feature original material alongside minimalist reimaginings of Shriekback songs; and the Stic Basin series of albums of experimental electronica, of which there are now three volumes.

In 2005, Andrews played keyboards on Brian Eno’s album &quot;Another Day on Earth&quot;. 2007 saw Andrews reunite with former XTC bandmate Andy Partridge alongside Shriekback drummer Martyn Barker on &quot;Monstrance&quot;, a double album of instrumental improvisations. In 2015, Andrews recorded a six-track EP called &quot;Juju Grid&quot; with Mike Tournier from Fluke, under the name of Anaxaton6. &quot;Contaminated Pop&quot; in 2019 was Andrews’ first solo album released under his own name.

During a six-year break from music from 1996 to 2001, Andrews began to design furniture and sculpture and studied for a degree in 3D Design in Metals at Camberwell and Middlesex universities. He also ran The Hoxton Gift Shop with Régine de la Hey in 2001, a gallery which sold original artworks.

==Personal life==
Andrews lives in London and Stroud, Gloucestershire. He has a son, Finn Andrews, the lead singer/songwriter of The Veils, from his marriage to Vivienne Kent in the early 1980s.

<doc id="277746" wikidata="Q4057928" url="?curid=277746" title="Adhola people">
<text>The Adhola people, also known as Jopadhola, are a Nilotic ethnic group of Luo peoples that live in Tororo District of Eastern Uganda and comprise about eight percent of the country&#x27;s total population. They speak Dhopadhola, (a Luo language), which belongs to the Western Nilotic branch of the Nilotic language family. They are primarily pastoralists. The Jopadhola call their land Padhola which, according to historian Bethwell Ogot, is an elliptic form of &quot;Pa Adhola&quot; meaning the &quot;place of Adhola&quot;, the founding father of the Jopadhola people. Officially, land of the Adhola is called Padhola, but the Baganda who misinterpret &#x27;Widoma&#x27; – a Dhopadhola word for &#x27;war cry&#x27; meaning &#x27;You are in trouble&#x27; refer to the Jopadhola as &quot;Badama&quot;. The social structure of the Jopadhola can be described as semi centralised because there is no traditional centralized government and its organization is limited to a clan called &quot;Nono&quot;. There are over 52 clans, each with cultural practices, common ancestry and a distinct lineage.

== Jopadhola traditional justice ==

Clans reproduce their notion of an independent court called &quot;koti&quot; using an abridged legal doctrine of separation of powers, and partially mimicking lower level government(local councils) and judicial features. The &quot;koti&quot; conflates executive and judicial functions, furthermore, legal qualifications are largely irrelevant. The composition of the &quot;koti&quot; aims to achieve age and gender parity through the appointment of youth and women representatives. The election of office bearers is based on fulfilling social obligations to kin through meritocracy, and to protecting of the clan from evil through ritual (&quot;chowiroki&quot;). Dr. Maureen Owor argues that given the fact that the court and litigants are personally acquainted as kin, Jopadhola clans appear to have created an &quot;expanded&quot; notion of &quot;judicial&quot; independence – one that is culturally appropriate for their local African context.

==History==

The Jopadhola arrived in southeastern Uganda in the 16th century during the long journey Luo migration from Egypt. They first settled in central Uganda, but gradually moved southwards and eastwards. Their kin who settled northern and central Uganda are Acholi and Alur populations, who speak languages similar to Dhopadhola. They settled in a forested area as a defence against attacks from Bantu neighbours who had already settled there. Unlike some other small Luo tribes, this self-imposed isolation helped them to maintain their language and culture amidst Bantu and Ateker communities.

Those Luo who proceeded their migration eastwards into present day Kenya and Tanzania are the JoLuo (commonly referred to only as Luo).

Legend has it that Owiny, the leader of the Kenyan Luo was the brother of Adhola the leader of the Jopadhola who decided to settle in Tororo instead of going along with his brother towards Kenya and Tanzania.

== Marriage ==
The Jopadhola marriages were arranged and men were not expected to hunt for women. As soon as a father bore a baby boy, his responsibility was to look for a parent with a new born baby girl where a strong relationship bond is built between the two families. Thereafter, the boy&#x27;s parents constantly visits the girl&#x27;s family and ceremonies are organized. Once the girl&#x27;s parents agree to a hand in marriage, the father of the boy puts a bracelet on the girl&#x27;s wrist to show she is booked for marriage. Once the boy reaches 18 years and the girl reaches 16 years, the boy&#x27;s parent shows his son the home of the girl. The boy is expected to go and bring the girl home, a matter that needs force to be applied in case of resistance.

== Cultural Leadership ==
Kwar Adhola Moses Stephen Owor is the current king (His Highness) for the Adhola people.

== Language ==

Jopadhola speak a language which is mutually intelligible with Acholi language, Alur language of Uganda and Dholuo language of Kenya. They call their language Dhopadhola. The prefix &quot;dho&quot; means &quot;language of&quot; and &quot;jo&quot; means &quot;people of&quot;. The infix &quot;pa&quot; means possessive &#x27;of&#x27; – hence Jopadhola means people of Adhola, and Dhopadhola the language of the Jo&#x27;padhola.

<text>The electric power industry covers the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric power to the general public and industry. The commercial distribution of electric power started in 1882 when electricity was produced for electric lighting. In the 1880s and 1890s, growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the industry. What was once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas, reliable and economical electric power has become an essential aspect for normal operation of all elements of developed economies.

By the middle of the 20th century, electricity was seen as a &quot;natural monopoly&quot;, only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market; in some areas, vertically-integrated companies provide all stages from generation to retail, and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure.

Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find.

==History==
Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an electrolytic cell since Alessandro Volta developed the voltaic pile in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive. In 1831, Michael Faraday devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the United States, Thomas Edison developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed direct current electricity.

Robert Hammond, in December 1881, demonstrated the new electric light in the Sussex town of Brighton in the UK for a trial period. The ensuing success of this installation enabled Hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing, as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light. Thus the Hammond Electricity Supply Co. was launched.

In early 1882, Edison opened the world&#x27;s first steam-powered electricity generating station at Holborn Viaduct in London, where he had entered into an agreement with the City Corporation for a period of three months to provide street lighting. In time he had supplied a number of local consumers with electric light. The method of supply was direct current (DC). Whilst the Godalming and the 1882 Holborn Viaduct Scheme closed after a few years the Brighton Scheme continued on, and supply was in 1887 made available for 24 hours per day.

It was later on in the year in September 1882 that Edison opened the Pearl Street Power Station in New York City and again it was a DC supply. It was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer&#x27;s premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. The voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise. For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the voltage reduces the current and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. Unfortunately it also increases the danger from direct contact and increases the required insulation thickness. Furthermore, some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages. The overall effect was that Edison&#x27;s system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers. While this could work in city centres, it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power.

The mid to late 1880s saw the introduction of alternating current (AC) systems in Europe and the U.S. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads. Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses. This made it more economical to distribute power over long distances. Generators (such as hydroelectric sites) could be located far from the loads. AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the war of the currents. The DC system was able to claim slightly greater safety, but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out.
The AC power system used today developed rapidly, backed by industrialists such as George Westinghouse with Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky, Galileo Ferraris, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, William Stanley Jr., Nikola Tesla, and others contributed to this field.

Power electronics is the application of solid-state electronics to the control and conversion of electric power. Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier in 1902, used to convert AC into DC. From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid-controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Grading electrodes made them suitable for high voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. In 1933, selenium rectifiers were invented. Transistor technology dates back to 1947, with the invention of the point-contact transistor, which was followed by the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in 1948. By the 1950s, higher power semiconductor diodes became available and started replacing vacuum tubes. In 1956, the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) was introduced, increasing the range of power electronic applications.

A breakthrough in power electronics came with the invention of the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) in 1959. Generations of MOSFETs enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors. In 1969, Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET, which would later be known as the VMOS (V-groove MOSFET). The power MOSFET has since become the most common power device in the world, due to its low gate drive power, fast switching speed, easy advanced paralleling capability, wide bandwidth, ruggedness, easy drive, simple biasing, ease of application, and ease of repair.

While HVDC is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent power systems, the bulk of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current.

== Organization ==

The electric power industry is commonly split up into four processes. These are electricity generation such as a power station, electric power transmission, electricity distribution and electricity retailing. In many countries, electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure. For this reason, electric power is viewed as a natural monopoly. The industry is generally heavily regulated, often with price controls and is frequently government-owned and operated. However, the modern trend has been growing deregulation in at least the latter two processes.

The nature and state of market reform of the electricity market often determines whether electric companies are able to be involved in just some of these processes without having to own the entire infrastructure, or citizens choose which components of infrastructure to patronise. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end-users of electricity may opt for more costly green electricity.

===Generation===
Generation is the conversion of some primary energy source into electric power suitable for commercial use on an electrical grid. Most commercial electric power is produced by rotating electrical machines, &quot;generators&quot;, which move conductors through a magnetic field to produce electric current. The generator is rotated by some other prime mover machine; in typical grid-connected generators this is a steam turbine, a gas turbine, or a hydraulic turbine. Primary energy sources for these machine are often fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), nuclear fission, geothermal steam, or falling water. Renewable sources such as wind and solar energy are increasingly of commercial importance.

Since electrical generation must be closely matched with electrical consumption, enough generation capacity must be installed to meet peak demands. At the same time, primary energy sources must be selected to minimize the cost of produced electrical energy. Generally the lowest-incremental-cost source of electrical energy will be the next unit connected to meet rising demand. Electrical generators have automatic controls to regulate the power fed into the electrical transmission system, adjusting generator output moment by moment to balance with electrical demand. For a large grid with scores or hundreds of generators connected and thousands of loads, management of stable generator supply is a problem with significant challenges, to meet economic, environmental and reliability requirements. For example, low-incremental-cost generation sources such as nuclear power plants may be run continually to meet the average &quot;base load&quot; of the connected system, whereas more costly peaking power plants such as natural gas turbines may be run for brief times during the day to meet peak loads. Alternatively, load management strategies may encourage more even demand for electrical power and reduce costly peaks. Designated generator units for a particular electrical grid may be run at partial output only, to provide &quot;spinning reserve&quot; for sudden increases in demand or faults with other generating units.

In addition to electrical power production, electrical generation units may provide other ancillary services to the electrical grid, such as frequency control, reactive power, and black start of a collapsed power grid. These ancillary services may be commercially valuable when the generation, transmission, and distribution electrical companies are separate commercial entities.

===Electric power transmission===
Electric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is known as the &quot;power grid&quot; in North America, or just &quot;the grid&quot;. In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia and New Zealand, the network is known as the National Grid.

A wide area synchronous grid, also known as an &quot;interconnection&quot; in North America, directly connects many generators delivering AC power with the same relative &quot;frequency&quot; numerous consumers. For example, there are four major interconnections in North America (the Western Interconnection, the Eastern Interconnection, the Quebec Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid). In Europe one large grid connects most of continental Europe.

Historically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have liberalized the regulation of the electricity market in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business.

===Electric power distribution===

Electric power distribution is the final stage in the delivery of electric power; it carries electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV with the use of transformers. &quot;Primary&quot; distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to distribution transformers located near the customer&#x27;s premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through &quot;secondary&quot; distribution lines. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through service drops. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.

===Electric retailing===

Electricity retailing is the final sale of electricity from generation to the end-use consumer.

== World electricity industries ==

The organization of the electrical sector of a country or region varies depending on the economic system of the country. In some places, all electric power generation, transmission and distribution is provided by a government controlled organization. Other regions have private or investor-owned utility companies, city or municipally owned companies, cooperative companies owned by their own customers, or combinations. Generation, transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company, or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system.

Not everyone has access to grid electricity. About 840 million people (mostly in Africa) had no access in 2017, down from 1.2 billion in 2010.

==Market reform==
The business model behind the electric utility has changed over the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990.

===United States===
In 1996 – 1999 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) made a series of decisions which were intended to open the U.S. wholesale power market to new players, with the hope that spurring competition would save consumers $4 to $5 billion per year and encourage technical innovation in the industry. Steps were taken to give all market participants open access to existing interstate transmission lines. 
* Order No. 888 ordered vertically integrated electric utilities to functionally separate their transmission, power generation and marketing businesses to prevent self-dealing. 
* Order No. 889 set up a system to provide all participants with timely access to information about available transmission capacity and prices. 
* The FERC also endorsed the concept of appointing independent system operators (ISOs) to manage the electric power grid – a function that was traditionally the responsibility of vertically integrated electric utility companies. The concept of an independent system operator evolved into that of regional transmission organizations (RTOs). FERC&#x27;s intention was that all U.S. companies owning interstate electric transmission lines would place those facilities under the control of an RTO. In its Order No. 2000 &quot;(Regional Transmission Organizations)&quot;, issued in 1999, FERC specified the minimum capabilities that an RTO should possess.

These decisions, which were intended to create a fully interconnected grid and an integrated national power market, resulted in the restructuring of the U.S. electricity industry. That process was soon dealt two setbacks: the California energy crisis of 2000, and the Enron scandal and collapse. Although industry restructuring proceeded, these events made clear that competitive markets could be manipulated and thus must be properly designed and monitored. Furthermore, the Northeast blackout of 2003 highlighted the need for a dual focus on competitive pricing and strong reliability standards.

===Other countries===
In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with generators and retailers trading electricity in a similar manner to shares and currency. As deregulation continues further, utilities are driven to sell their assets as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the futures and spot markets and other financial arrangements. Even globalization with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the UK&#x27;s National Grid, the largest private electric utility in the world, bought several electric utilities in New England for $3.2 billion. Between 1995 and 1997, seven of the 12 Regional Electric Companies (RECs) in England and Wales were bought by U.S. energy companies. Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in space flight; aeroderivative gas turbines used in jet aircraft; solar engineering and photovoltaic systems; off-shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.

==Outlook==
Electricity is expected to see growing demand in the future. The Information Revolution is highly reliant on electric power. Other growth areas include emerging new electricity-exclusive technologies, developments in space conditioning, industrial processes, and transportation (for example hybrid vehicles, locomotives).

<text>Frederic Edwin Church (May 4, 1826 – April 7, 1900) was an American landscape painter born in Hartford, Connecticut. He was a central figure in the Hudson River School of American landscape painters, best known for painting large landscapes, often depicting mountains, waterfalls, and sunsets. Church&#x27;s paintings put an emphasis on realistic detail, dramatic light, and panoramic views. He debuted some of his major works in single-painting exhibitions to a paying and often enthralled audience in New York City. In his prime, he was one of the most famous painters in the United States.

==Biography==

===Beginnings===

Frederic Edwin Church was a direct descendant of Richard Church, a Puritan pioneer from England who accompanied Thomas Hooker on the original journey through the wilderness from Massachusetts to what would become Hartford, Connecticut. Church was the son of Eliza (1796–1883) and Joseph Church (1793–1876). Frederic had two sisters and no surviving brothers. His father was successful in business as a silversmith and jeweler and was a director at several financial firms. His mother&#x27;s brother was Adrian Janes, who owned an iron foundry that constructed the U.S. Capitol Dome. The family&#x27;s wealth allowed Frederic to pursue his interest in art from a very early age. In 1844, aged 18, Church became the pupil of landscape artist Thomas Cole in Catskill, New York after Daniel Wadsworth, a family neighbor and founder of the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Connecticut, introduced the two. Church studied with him for two years; by this time his talent was evident. Cole wrote that Church had &quot;the finest eye for drawing in the world&quot;. During his time with Cole he travelled around New England and New York to make sketches, visiting East Hampton, Connecticut, Long Island, Catskill Mountain House, The Berkshires, New Haven, Connecticut, and Vermont. His first recorded sale was in 1846 to the Wadsworth Athenaeum for $130; it was a pastoral painting depicting Hooker&#x27;s journey in 1636. 

In 1848, he was elected the youngest Associate of the National Academy of Design. He was promoted to full member the following year and began to take in his own students including Walter Launt Palmer, William James Stillman and Jervis McEntee.

==Style and influences==

Romanticism was prominent in Britain and France in the early 1800s as a counter-movement to the rationalism of the Age of Enlightenment. Artists of the Romantic period often depicted nature in idealized scenes that depicted the richness and beauty of nature, sometimes with emphasis on its grand scale. This tradition carried on in the works of Church, who idealizes an uninterrupted nature, highlighted by his excruciatingly detailed art. The emphasis on nature is encouraged by low horizontal lines and a preponderance of sky. Church usually &quot;hid&quot; his brushstrokes so that the painting surface was smooth and the painter&#x27;s &quot;personality&quot; seemingly absent.

Church was the product of the second generation of the Hudson River School, a movement in American landscape art founded by his teacher Thomas Cole. Both Cole and Church were devout Protestants, and the latter&#x27;s beliefs played a role in his paintings, especially his early canvases. Hudson River School paintings were characterized by their focus on traditional pastoral settings, especially the Catskill Mountains, and their Romantic qualities. They attempted to capture the wild realism of an unsettled America that was quickly disappearing, and the appreciation of natural beauty. His American frontier landscapes show the &quot;expansionist and optimistic outlook of the United States in the mid-nineteenth century.&quot; Church differed from Cole in the topics of his paintings: he preferred natural and often majestic scenes over Cole&#x27;s propensity towards allegory—though Church&#x27;s work has increasingly been re-examined in terms of themes and meanings.

The Prussian explorer and scientist Alexander von Humboldt was a major influence on Church. In his &quot;Kosmos&quot;, Humboldt put forth a vision of the interconnectedness of science, the natural world, and spiritual concerns. &quot;Kosmos&quot;, which Church owned, dedicated a chapter to landscape painting; Humboldt gave an important role to the visual artist in &quot;scientifically&quot; portraying the diversity of nature, especially in the New World. As Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution began to overturn Humboldt&#x27;s ideas of unity in the 1860s, art historians have examined how Church&#x27;s painting responded to this disruption in Church&#x27;s world view.

The English art critic John Ruskin was another important and big influence on Church. In Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Painters&quot;, he emphasizes the close observation of nature: &quot;the imperative duty of the landscape painter [is] to descend to the lowest details with undiminished attention. Every class of rock, every kind of earth, every form of cloud, must be studied with equal industry, and rendered with equal precision.&quot; This attention to detail must be combined with the artist&#x27;s interpretation, impressions, and imagination to achieve great art. While Church&#x27;s paintings were widely praised in the 1850s and 1860s, some critics found his detailed panoramas lacking in the imaginative or poetic. In his 1879 &quot;American Painters&quot;, George W. Sheldon wrote of Church&#x27;s canvases, &quot;It is scarcely necessary to ... explain what their principal defect is, because, by this time, that defect must have been recognized by almost every intelligent American lover of art. It consists in the elaboration of details at the expense of the unity and force of sentiment... They are faithful and beautiful, but they are not so rich as they might be in the poetry, the aroma, of art. The higher and spiritual verities of Nature are the true home of landscape art.&quot;

Some of Church&#x27;s paintings relate to, and influenced, the luminist landscape style as well. Luminist art tends to emphasize horizontals, use non-diffuse light, and hide brushstrokes such that the painter&#x27;s presence, or &quot;personality&quot;, is less apparent to the viewer. An exhibition book considers Church&#x27;s &quot;Morning in the Tropics&quot; and &quot;Twilight in the Wilderness&quot; to highlight the style&#x27;s &quot;meticulous draftsmanship and intense colors&quot;, while &quot;Cotopaxi&quot; and &quot;The Parthenon&quot; &quot;exemplify the style ... in their panoramic structure&quot;. Nevertheless, Church is not considered a primarily luminist artist.

==Career==

Church began his career by painting classic Hudson River School scenes of New York and New England, but by 1850, he had settled in New York. He exhibited his art at the American Art Union, the Boston Art Club, and (most impressively for a young artist) the National Academy of Design. His method consisted of creating paintings in his studio based on sketches in nature. In the earlier years of his career, Church&#x27;s style was reminiscent of that of his teacher, Thomas Cole, and epitomized the Hudson River School&#x27;s founding styles. As his style progressed he departed from Cole&#x27;s approach: he painted in more elaborate detail and his compositions became more adventurous in format, sometimes with dramatic light effects.

Church quickly earned a reputation as a traveler-artist, with early domestic painting and sketching trips to the White Mountains, western Massachusetts, the Catskills, Hartford, Conn, Niagara, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maine. He made two trips to South America in 1853 and 1857 and stayed predominantly in Quito, visiting the volcanoes and cities of modern day Colombia and Ecuador, and crossing the isthmus of Panama. The first trip was with businessman Cyrus West Field, who financed the voyage, hoping to use Church&#x27;s paintings to lure investors to his South American ventures. Church was inspired by Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s exploration of the continent in the early 1800s; Humboldt had challenged artists to portray the &quot;physiognomy&quot; of the Andes. After Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America&quot; was published in 1852, Church jumped at the chance to travel and study in Humboldt&#x27;s footsteps. When Church returned to South America in 1857 with painter Louis Rémy Mignot, he added to his sketches of the area. After both trips, Church had produced a number of landscapes of Ecuador and the Andes, such as &quot;The Andes of Ecuador&quot; (1855), &quot;Cayambe&quot; (1858), &quot;The Heart of the Andes&quot; (1859), and &quot;Cotopaxi&quot; (1862). &quot;The Heart of the Andes&quot;, Church&#x27;s most famous painting, pictures several elements of topography combined into an idealistic, broad portrait of nature. The painting was very large, yet highly detailed; every species of plant and animal is identifiable and numerous climate zones appear at once.

As he had with &quot;Niagara&quot; before, Church debuted &quot;The Heart of the Andes&quot; in a single-painting exhibition in New York City in 1859. Thousands of people paid to see the painting, with the painting&#x27;s huge floor-based frame playing the part of a window looking out on the Andes. The audience sat on benches to view the piece, sometimes using opera glasses to get close, and Church strategically arranged the room to illuminate the painting with the light from overhead skylights. The work was an instant success. Church eventually sold it for $10,000, at that time the highest price ever paid for a work by a living American artist.

Church&#x27;s friendship with Isaac Israel Hayes, a prominent arctic explorer, stimulated the artist&#x27;s interest in the arctic regions. In 1859, Church and his good friend Rev. Louis Legrand Noble traveled to Newfoundland and Labrador. The journey was chronicled in Noble&#x27;s book &quot;After Icebergs with a Painter&quot; (1861), published shortly before Church&#x27;s painting &quot;The Icebergs&quot; went on display.

By 1860, Church was the most renowned American artist. In his prime, Church was a commercial as well as an artistic success. Church&#x27;s art was very lucrative; he was reported to be worth half a million dollars at his death in 1900.

In 1861, at the start of the Civil War, Church was inspired to paint &quot;Our Banner in the Sky&quot; by a sunset featuring red, white, and blue that he believed was a symbol that &quot;the heavens indicated their support for the United States by reflecting the nation&#x27;s colors in the setting sun&quot;. A lithograph was made from it and sold to benefit the families of Union soldiers.

In 1863, he was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===Family, later travels, and Olana===
In 1860, Church bought a farm near Hudson, New York and married Isabel Mortimer Carnes (born 1836, of Dayton, Ohio), whom he had met during the New York exhibition of &quot;The Heart of the Andes&quot;. They soon started a family, but their two-year-old son Herbert and five-month-old daughter Emma both died of diphtheria in March 1865. Still grief stricken, Church, his wife, and a young artist they befriended traveled to Jamaica. Church sketched while Isabel made a collection of pressed Jamaican ferns. He and his wife started a new family with the birth of Frederic Joseph in 1866, followed by Theodore Winthrop in 1869, Louis Palmer in 1870 and Isabel Charlotte (&quot;Downie&quot;) in 1871.
In late 1867, Church began the longest period of travel of his career. That fall he and his family went to Europe, moving through London and Paris fairly quickly. From Marseille they went to Alexandria, Egypt, but Church did not visit the pyramids, perhaps being afraid to leave his family alone. Passing through Jaffa, they arrived at Beirut, where they spent four months. They stayed with American missionaries, including David Stuart Dodge. In February 1868 Church travelled with Dodge to the city of Petra by camel from Jerusalem. There he sketched the &quot;Al Khazneh&quot; tomb, which became the subject of one of his important later works, &quot;El Khasné, Petra&quot; (1874). Later that spring the family visited Damascus and Baalbek, then sailed the Aegean Sea with a stop in Constantinople. Back in southern Europe by summer, they wintered in Rome. There were many American artists in Rome that year, and they joined several artist/friends, including Sanford Robinson Gifford, Jervis McEntee and other friends who were also living in Rome. While in Rome, Church learned fresco painting, and made a collection of &quot;Old Masters&quot; paintings. However, apparently Europe on the whole did not seem to interest Church as it did most American artists of the 19th century, many of whom traveled there to experience the Western artistic heritage. Leaving his expanded family in Rome with friends, Frederic made a two-week visit to stay in Athens ended the journey in April 1869. At Athens the Parthenon impressed him, and he sketched and painted it energetically. The Churches left Rome in May 1869, and made their way home via Paris and England, arriving home by the end of June.

Before departing the United States for that trip, Church purchased the on the hilltop above his Hudson farmland, which he had long wanted for its magnificent views of the Hudson River and the Catskills. In 1870, he began the construction of a Persian-inspired mansion on the hilltop, and the family moved into the home in the summer of 1872. Today this estate is conserved as the Olana State Historic Site. Richard Morris Hunt was consulted early on in the plans for the mansion at Olana, but after the Churches&#x27; trip, the English-born American architect Calvert Vaux was hired to complete the project. Church was deeply involved in the process, even completing his own architectural sketches for its design. This highly personal and eclectic building incorporated many of the design ideas that he had acquired during his travels. In one letter of the period, he wrote &quot;I have made about 1 3/4 miles of road this season, opening entirely new and beautiful views. I can make more and better landscapes in this way than by tampering with canvas and paint in the studio.&quot; He devoted much of his energy during his last twenty years to Olana.

Church had been enormously successful as an artist. In his last decades, illness limited Church&#x27;s ability to paint. By 1876, Church was stricken with rheumatoid arthritis, making painting difficult. He eventually painted with his left hand and continued to produce works, although at a much slower pace. He still taught painting as Cole had before him. Two students were Walter Launt Palmer, son of his close friend Erastus Dow Palmer, and Howard Russell Butler. In later life he often wintered in Mexico, where he taught Butler.

Spending time at Olana and in Mexico, Church was less exposed to trends in New York City. He kept a studio there into the 1880s, but it was usually sublet to Martin Johnson Heade. His wife Isabel had been ill for years, and she died on May 12, 1899, at the home of their late friend and patron, William H. Osborn, on Park Avenue in New York. Less than a year later, on April 7, 1900, at the age of 73, Church also died at the home of Osborn&#x27;s widow. Frederic and Isabel were buried in the family plot at Spring Grove Cemetery, Hartford, Connecticut.

==Legacy==

In the last decades of his life Church&#x27;s fame dwindled, and by his death in 1900 there was little interest in his work. His paintings were seen as part of an &quot;old-fashioned and discredited&quot; school that was too devoted to details. His reputation improved with a 1945 exhibition devoted to the Hudson River School at the Art Institute of Chicago, and that year the &quot;Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin&quot; revisited the original reception of &quot;The Heart of the Andes&quot;. In 1960 art historian David C. Huntington completed a dissertation on Church that explored his influences and milieu. By 1966 he had written a monograph on Church and organized the first exhibition devoted to Church since his death, for the National Collection of Fine Arts. Huntington recognized Church&#x27;s estate as his greatest artwork and spearheaded the effort to preserve Olana when the property, which had been preserved largely as Church created it by later generations of the family, was threatened with destruction. He spearheaded a two-year campaign to save Frederic Church&#x27;s Olana, resulting in a public-private partnership that created Olana State Historic Site.

Church&#x27;s legacy was rekindled; American museums began to acquire his works, and by 1979 Church&#x27;s &quot;The Icebergs&quot; sold for $2.5 million, then the third-highest auction for any work of art. The next year the National Gallery of Art held a major exhibition, &quot;American Light: The Luminist Movement, 1825–1875&quot;, which positioned Church as the leading American painter of his time.

Church&#x27;s paintings, more confident and on a grander scale than those of his contemporaries, uniquely captured the spirit of an optimistic American people who associated the landscape of the New World with manifest destiny. Art historian Barbara Novak wrote that Church was &quot;a paradigm of the artist who becomes the public voice of a culture, summarizing its beliefs, embodying its ideas, and confirming its assumptions.&quot;

Olana State Historic Site is now owned and operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Taconic Region, and with its curatorial work, visitor services, and external relations managed by The Olana Partnership, a private, non-profit organization. In 1999, just before the centenary of Church&#x27;s death, The Olana Partnership established the Frederic Church Award to honor individuals and organizations who make extraordinary contributions to American art and culture.
