<text>Mathematics and architecture are related, since architecture, like some other arts, uses mathematics for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering buildings, architects use geometry: to define the spatial form of a building; from the Pythagoreans of the sixth century BC onwards, to create architectural forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, aesthetic and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as tessellations; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, India, and the Islamic world, buildings including pyramids, temples, mosques, palaces and mausoleums were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, geometric shapes and geometric tiling patterns are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a fractal-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in Hindu cosmology. In Chinese architecture, the tulou of Fujian province are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In Renaissance architecture, symmetry and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio, influenced by Vitruvius&#x27;s &quot;De architectura&quot; from ancient Rome and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, Vladimir Shukhov in Russia and Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona pioneered the use of hyperboloid structures; in the Sagrada Família, Gaudí also incorporated hyperbolic paraboloids, tessellations, catenary arches, catenoids, helicoids, and ruled surfaces. In the twentieth century, styles such as modern architecture and Deconstructivism explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. Minimal surfaces have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at Denver International Airport, while Richard Buckminster Fuller pioneered the use of the strong thin-shell structures known as geodesic domes.

==Connected fields==
The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between architecture and mathematics, note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure study of number and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since antiquity. In ancient Rome, Vitruvius described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily geometry, to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the Middle Ages, where graduates learnt arithmetic, geometry and aesthetics alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the trivium) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the Renaissance, the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the Renaissance man such as Leon Battista Alberti. Similarly in England, Sir Christopher Wren, known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist Theodor Adorno, identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be &quot;revolutionary&quot;, introducing wholly new ideas; &quot;reactionary&quot;, failing to introduce change; or &quot;revivalist&quot;, actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the Gothic Revival in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian Mannerism of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century Baroque and Palladian movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th-century movements such as Futurism and Constructivism actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to Modernist architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, fractal geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was aperiodic tiling, to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.

Architects use mathematics for several reasons, leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the engineering of buildings. Firstly, they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building. 
Secondly, they use mathematics to design forms that are considered beautiful or harmonious. From the time of the Pythagoreans with their religious philosophy of number, architects in ancient Greece, ancient Rome, the Islamic world and the Italian Renaissance have chosen the proportions of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles. Thirdly, they may use mathematical objects such as tessellations to decorate buildings. Fourthly, they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise whirling air currents at the base of tall buildings.

==Secular aesthetics==

===Ancient Rome===

====Vitruvius====

The influential ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and &quot;symmetria&quot;. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. &quot;Symmetria&quot; in Vitruvius&#x27;s usage means something closer to the English term modularity than mirror symmetry, as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at Fano, he uses ratios of small integers, especially the triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, ...) to proportion the structure into (Vitruvian) modules. Thus the Basilica&#x27;s width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his &quot;De architectura&quot;, : firmness, usefulness (or &quot;Commodity&quot; in Henry Wotton&#x27;s 17th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.

====The Pantheon====
The Pantheon in Rome has survived intact, illustrating classical Roman structure, proportion, and decoration. The main structure is a dome, the apex left open as a circular oculus to let in light; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, , so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube, and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter. These dimensions make more sense when expressed in ancient Roman units of measurement: The dome spans 150 Roman feet); the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high. The Pantheon remains the world&#x27;s largest unreinforced concrete dome.

===Renaissance===

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s 1450 (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius&#x27;s &quot;De architectura&quot; and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:. Alberti also documented Filippo Brunelleschi&#x27;s discovery of linear perspective, developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.

The next major text was Sebastiano Serlio&#x27;s &quot;Regole generali d&#x27;architettura&quot; (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books1 and 2) covered geometry and perspective. Two of Serlio&#x27;s methods for constructing perspectives were wrong, but this did not stop his work being widely used.

In 1570, Andrea Palladio published the influential &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (The Four Books of Architecture) in Venice. This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe, assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 &quot;The Elements of Architecture&quot;. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio&#x27;s designs related to the whole, usually square, villa. Palladio permitted a range of ratios in the &quot;Quattro libri&quot;, stating:

In 1615, Vincenzo Scamozzi published the late Renaissance treatise &quot;L&#x27;idea dell&#x27;architettura universale&quot; (The Idea of a Universal Architecture). He attempted to relate the design of cities and buildings to the ideas of Vitruvius and the Pythagoreans, and to the more recent ideas of Palladio.

===Nineteenth century===

Hyperboloid structures were used starting towards the end of the nineteenth century by Vladimir Shukhov for masts, lighthouses and cooling towers. Their striking shape is both aesthetically interesting and strong, using structural materials economically. Shukhov&#x27;s first hyperboloidal tower was exhibited in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896.

===Twentieth century===

The early twentieth century movement Modern architecture, pioneered by Russian Constructivism, used rectilinear Euclidean (also called Cartesian) geometry. In the De Stijl movement, the horizontal and the vertical were seen as constituting the universal. The architectural form consists of putting these two directional tendencies together, using roof planes, wall planes and balconies, which either slide past or intersect each other, as in the 1924 Rietveld Schröder House by Gerrit Rietveld.

Modernist architects were free to make use of curves as well as planes. Charles Holden&#x27;s 1933 Arnos station has a circular ticket hall in brick with a flat concrete roof. In 1938, the Bauhaus painter László Moholy-Nagy adopted Raoul Heinrich Francé&#x27;s seven biotechnical elements, namely the crystal, the sphere, the cone, the plane, the (cuboidal) strip, the (cylindrical) rod, and the spiral, as the supposed basic building blocks of architecture inspired by nature.

Le Corbusier proposed an anthropometric scale of proportions in architecture, the Modulor, based on the supposed height of a man. Le Corbusier&#x27;s 1955 Chapelle Notre-Dame du Haut uses free-form curves not describable in mathematical formulae. The shapes are said to be evocative of natural forms such as the prow of a ship or praying hands. The design is only at the largest scale: there is no hierarchy of detail at smaller scales, and thus no fractal dimension; the same applies to other famous twentieth-century buildings such as the Sydney Opera House, Denver International Airport, and the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao.

Contemporary architecture, in the opinion of the 90 leading architects who responded to a 2010 World Architecture Survey, is extremely diverse; the best was judged to be Frank Gehry&#x27;s Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao.

Denver International Airport&#x27;s terminal building, completed in 1995, has a fabric roof supported as a minimal surface (i.e., its mean curvature is zero) by steel cables. It evokes Colorado&#x27;s snow-capped mountains and the teepee tents of Native Americans.

The architect Richard Buckminster Fuller is famous for designing strong thin-shell structures known as geodesic domes. The Montréal Biosphère dome is high; its diameter is .

Sydney Opera House has a dramatic roof consisting of soaring white vaults, reminiscent of ship&#x27;s sails; to make them possible to construct using standardized components, the vaults are all composed of triangular sections of spherical shells with the same radius. These have the required uniform curvature in every direction.

The late twentieth century movement Deconstructivism creates deliberate disorder with what Nikos Salingaros in &quot;A Theory of Architecture&quot; calls random forms of high complexity by using non-parallel walls, superimposed grids and complex 2-D surfaces, as in Frank Gehry&#x27;s Disney Concert Hall and Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao. Until the twentieth century, architecture students were obliged to have a grounding in mathematics. Salingaros argues that first &quot;overly simplistic, politically-driven&quot; Modernism and then &quot;anti-scientific&quot; Deconstructivism have effectively separated architecture from mathematics. He believes that this &quot;reversal of mathematical values&quot; is harmful, as the &quot;pervasive aesthetic&quot; of non-mathematical architecture trains people &quot;to reject mathematical information in the built environment&quot;; he argues that this has negative effects on society.

==Religious principles==

===Ancient Egypt===

The pyramids of ancient Egypt are tombs constructed with mathematical proportions, but which these were, and whether the Pythagorean theorem was used, are debated. The ratio of the slant height to half the base length of the Great Pyramid of Giza is less than 1% from the golden ratio. If this was the design method, it would imply the use of Kepler&#x27;s triangle (face angle 51°49&#x27;), but according to many historians of science, the golden ratio was not known until the time of the Pythagoreans.

The proportions of some pyramids may have also been based on the 3:4:5 triangle (face angle 53°8&#x27;), known from the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (c. 1650–1550 BC); this was first conjectured by historian Moritz Cantor in 1882. It is known that right angles were laid out accurately in ancient Egypt using knotted cords for measurement, that Plutarch recorded in &quot;Isis and Osiris&quot; (c. 100 AD) that the Egyptians admired the 3:4:5 triangle, and that a scroll from before 1700 BC demonstrated basic square formulas. Historian Roger L. Cooke observes that &quot;It is hard to imagine anyone being interested in such conditions without knowing the Pythagorean theorem,&quot; but also notes that no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle&#x27;s sides, and that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle. Cooke concludes that Cantor&#x27;s conjecture remains uncertain; he guesses that the ancient Egyptians probably knew the Pythagorean theorem, but &quot;there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles.&quot;

===Ancient India===

Vaastu Shastra, the ancient Indian canons of architecture and town planning, employs symmetrical drawings called mandalas. Complex calculations are used to arrive at the dimensions of a building and its components. The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns (yantra), symmetry and directional alignments. However, early builders may have come upon mathematical proportions by accident. The mathematician Georges Ifrah notes that simple &quot;tricks&quot; with string and stakes can be used to lay out geometric shapes, such as ellipses and right angles.

The mathematics of fractals has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall gopuram gatehouses of Hindu temples such as the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi built in the seventh century, and others such as the Kandariya Mahadev Temple at Khajuraho, the parts and the whole have the same character, with fractal dimension in the range 1.7 to 1.8. The cluster of smaller towers (&quot;shikhara&quot;, lit. &#x27;mountain&#x27;) about the tallest, central, tower which represents the holy Mount Kailash, abode of Lord Shiva, depicts the endless repetition of universes in Hindu cosmology. The religious studies scholar William J. Jackson observed of the pattern of towers grouped among smaller towers, themselves grouped among still smaller towers, that:

The Meenakshi Amman Temple is a large complex with multiple shrines, with the streets of Madurai laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras. The four gateways are tall towers (gopurams) with fractal-like repetitive structure as at Hampi. The enclosures around each shrine are rectangular and surrounded by high stone walls.

===Ancient Greece===

Pythagoras (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that &quot;all things are numbers&quot;. They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word &quot;symmetria&quot; originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building&#x27;s smallest details right up to its entire design.

The Parthenon is long, wide and high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight of the Pythagoreans 42:62:92. This sets the module as 0.858 m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ( wide by 48.3 m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, , and the spacing of their centres, , is also 4:9.

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as John Julius Norwich &quot;the most perfect Doric temple ever built&quot;. Its elaborate architectural refinements include &quot;a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls and the &quot;entasis&quot; of the columns&quot;. &quot;Entasis&quot; refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples, the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a kilometre and a half above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the architrave and roof above: &quot;all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves&quot;.

The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when Euclid described the method of geometric construction. It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases. More recent authors such as Nikos Salingaros, however, doubt all these claims. Experiments by the computer scientist George Markowsky failed to find any preference for the golden rectangle.

===Islamic architecture===

The historian of Islamic art Antonio Fernandez-Puertas suggests that the Alhambra, like the Great Mosque of Cordoba, was designed using the Hispano-Muslim foot or &quot;codo&quot; of about . In the palace&#x27;s Court of the Lions, the proportions follow a series of surds. A rectangle with sides 1and has (by Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem) a diagonal of , which describes the right triangle made by the sides of the court; the series continues with (giving a 1:2 ratio), and so on. The decorative patterns are similarly proportioned, generating squares inside circles and eight-pointed stars, generating six-pointed stars. There is no evidence to support earlier claims that the golden ratio was used in the Alhambra. The Court of the Lions is bracketed by the Hall of Two Sisters and the Hall of the Abencerrajes; a regular hexagon can be drawn from the centres of these two halls and the four inside corners of the Court of the Lions.

The Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, Turkey, was built by Mimar Sinan to provide a space where the mihrab could be seen from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by eight enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of diameter and high. The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes, and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets, tall. The building&#x27;s plan is thus a circle, inside an octagon, inside a square.

===Mughal architecture===

Mughal architecture, as seen in the abandoned imperial city of Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal complex, has a distinctive mathematical order and a strong aesthetic based on symmetry and harmony.

The Taj Mahal exemplifies Mughal architecture, both representing paradise and displaying the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan&#x27;s power through its scale, symmetry and costly decoration. The white marble mausoleum, decorated with pietra dura, the great gate (&quot;Darwaza-i rauza&quot;), other buildings, the gardens and paths together form a unified hierarchical design. The buildings include a mosque in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or &#x27;answer&#x27; on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal charbagh (&#x27;fourfold garden&#x27;) is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of Paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum. These are divided in turn into 16 parterres.

The Taj Mahal complex was laid out on a grid, subdivided into smaller grids. The historians of architecture Koch and Barraud agree with the traditional accounts that give the width of the complex as 374 Mughal yards or gaz, the main area being three 374-gaz squares. These were divided in areas like the bazaar and caravanserai into 17-gaz modules; the garden and terraces are in modules of 23 gaz, and are 368 gaz wide (16 x 23). The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7units, then it has a width of 17 units, which may help to explain the choice of ratios in the complex.

===Christian architecture===

The Christian patriarchal basilica of Haghia Sophia in Byzantium (now Istanbul), first constructed in 537 (and twice rebuilt), was for a thousand years the largest cathedral ever built. It inspired many later buildings including Sultan Ahmed and other mosques in the city. The Byzantine architecture includes a nave crowned by a circular dome and two half-domes, all of the same diameter (), with a further five smaller half-domes forming an apse and four rounded corners of a vast rectangular interior. This was interpreted by mediaeval architects as representing the mundane below (the square base) and the divine heavens above (the soaring spherical dome). The emperor Justinian used two geometers, Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles as architects; Isidore compiled the works of Archimedes on solid geometry, and was influenced by him.

The importance of water baptism in Christianity was reflected in the scale of baptistry architecture. The oldest, the Lateran Baptistry in Rome, built in 440, set a trend for octagonal baptistries; the baptismal font inside these buildings was often octagonal, though Italy&#x27;s largest baptistry, at Pisa, built between 1152 and 1363, is circular, with an octagonal font. It is high, with a diameter of (a ratio of 8:5). Saint Ambrose wrote that fonts and baptistries were octagonal &quot;because on the eighth day, by rising, Christ loosens the bondage of death and receives the dead from their graves.&quot;
Saint Augustine similarly described the eighth day as &quot;everlasting ... hallowed by the resurrection of Christ&quot;. The octagonal Baptistry of Saint John, Florence, built between 1059 and 1128, is one of the oldest buildings in that city, and one of the last in the direct tradition of classical antiquity; it was extremely influential in the subsequent Florentine Renaissance, as major architects including Francesco Talenti, Alberti and Brunelleschi used it as the model of classical architecture.

The number five is used &quot;exuberantly&quot; in the 1721 Pilgrimage Church of St John of Nepomuk at Zelená hora, near Žďár nad Sázavou in the Czech republic, designed by Jan Blažej Santini Aichel. The nave is circular, surrounded by five pairs of columns and five oval domes alternating with ogival apses. The church further has five gates, five chapels, five altars and five stars; a legend claims that when Saint John of Nepomuk was martyred, five stars appeared over his head. The fivefold architecture may also symbolise the five wounds of Christ and the five letters of &quot;Tacui&quot; (Latin: &quot;I kept silence&quot; [about secrets of the confessional]).

Antoni Gaudí used a wide variety of geometric structures, some being minimal surfaces, in the Sagrada Família, Barcelona, started in 1882 (and not completed as of 2023). These include hyperbolic paraboloids and hyperboloids of revolution, tessellations, catenary arches, catenoids, helicoids, and ruled surfaces. This varied mix of geometries is creatively combined in different ways around the church. For example, in the Passion Façade of Sagrada Família, Gaudí assembled stone &quot;branches&quot; in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids, which overlap at their tops (directrices) without, therefore, meeting at a point. In contrast, in the colonnade there are hyperbolic paraboloidal surfaces that smoothly join other structures to form unbounded surfaces. Further, Gaudí exploits natural patterns, themselves mathematical, with columns derived from the shapes of trees, and lintels made from unmodified basalt naturally cracked (by cooling from molten rock) into hexagonal columns.

The 1971 Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, San Francisco has a saddle roof composed of eight segments of hyperbolic paraboloids, arranged so that the bottom horizontal cross section of the roof is a square and the top cross section is a Christian cross. The building is a square on a side, and high. The 1970 Cathedral of Brasília by Oscar Niemeyer makes a different use of a hyperboloid structure; it is constructed from 16 identical concrete beams, each weighing 90 tonnes, arranged in a circle to form a hyperboloid of revolution, the white beams creating a shape like hands praying to heaven. Only the dome is visible from outside: most of the building is below ground.

Several medieval churches in Scandinavia are circular, including four on the Danish island of Bornholm. One of the oldest of these, Østerlars Church from , has a circular nave around a massive circular stone column, pierced with arches and decorated with a fresco. The circular structure has three storeys and was apparently fortified, the top storey having served for defence.

==Mathematical decoration==

===Islamic architectural decoration===
Islamic buildings are often decorated with geometric patterns which typically make use of several mathematical tessellations, formed of ceramic tiles (girih, zellige) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes. Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns. Some of these are based on the &quot;Khatem Sulemani&quot; or Solomon&#x27;s seal motif, which is an eight-pointed star made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre. Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible wallpaper groups; as early as 1944, Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations, while in 1986 Branko Grünbaum claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra, asserting controversially that the remaining four groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament.

===Modern architectural decoration===

Towards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings. In 1913, the Modernist architect Adolf Loos had declared that &quot;Ornament is a crime&quot;, influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century. In the 21st century, architects are again starting to explore the use of ornament. 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse. Henning Larsen&#x27;s 2011 Harpa Concert and Conference Centre, Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass. Foreign Office Architects&#x27; 2010 Ravensbourne College, London is tessellated decoratively with 28,000 anodised aluminium tiles in red, white and brown, interlinking circular windows of differing sizes. The tessellation uses three types of tile, an equilateral triangle and two irregular pentagons. Kazumi Kudo&#x27;s Kanazawa Umimirai Library creates a decorative grid made of small circular blocks of glass set into plain concrete walls.

==Defence==

===Europe===

The architecture of fortifications evolved from medieval fortresses, which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical star forts able to resist artillery bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include Michelangelo, Baldassare Peruzzi, Vincenzo Scamozzi and Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.

The architectural historian Siegfried Giedion argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance ideal city: &quot;The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city.&quot;

===China===

In Chinese architecture, the tulou of Fujian province are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.

==Environmental goals==

Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals. For example, Foster and Partners&#x27; 30 St Mary Axe, London, known as &quot;The Gherkin&quot; for its cucumber-like shape, is a solid of revolution designed using parametric modelling. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building&#x27;s apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are quadrilaterals, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.

The traditional yakhchal (ice pit) of Persia functioned as an evaporative cooler. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with windcatchers.&#x27;

<doc id="279314" wikidata="Q4290083" url="?curid=279314" title="Membrane paradigm">
<text>In black hole theory, the black hole membrane paradigm is a simplified model, useful for visualising and calculating the effects predicted by quantum mechanics for the exterior physics of black holes, without using quantum-mechanical principles or calculations. It models a black hole as a thin, classically radiating surface (or membrane) at or vanishingly close to the black hole&#x27;s event horizon. This approach to the theory of black holes was created by Kip S. Thorne, R. H. Price and D. A. Macdonald.

==Electrical resistance==
Thorne (1994) relates that this approach to studying black holes was prompted by the realisation by Hanni, Ruffini, Wald and Cohen in the early 1970s that since an electrically charged pellet dropped into a black hole should still &quot;appear&quot; to a distant outsider to be remaining just outside the event horizon, if its image persists, its electrical fieldlines ought to persist too, and ought to point to the location of the &quot;frozen&quot; image (1994, pp. 406). If the black hole rotates, and the image of the pellet is pulled around, the associated electrical fieldlines ought to be pulled around with it to create basic &quot;electrical dynamo&quot; effects (&quot;see:&quot; dynamo theory).

Further calculations yielded properties for a black hole such as apparent electrical resistance (pp. 408). Since these fieldline properties seemed to be exhibited down to the event horizon, and general relativity insisted that no dynamic exterior interactions could extend &quot;through&quot; the horizon, it was considered convenient to invent a surface &quot;at&quot; the horizon that these electrical properties could be said to belong to.

==Hawking radiation==
After being introduced to model the theoretical electrical characteristics of the horizon, the membrane approach was then pressed into service to model the Hawking radiation effect predicted by quantum mechanics.

In the coordinate system of a distant stationary observer, Hawking radiation tends to be described as a quantum-mechanical particle-pair production effect (involving virtual particles), but for stationary observers hovering nearer to the hole, the effect is supposed to look like a purely conventional radiation effect involving real particles. In the membrane paradigm, the black hole is described as it should be seen by an array of these stationary, suspended noninertial observers, and since their shared coordinate system ends at the event horizon (because an observer cannot legally hover at or below the event horizon under general relativity), this conventional-looking radiation is described as being emitted by an arbitrarily thin shell of hot material at or just above the event horizon, where this coordinate system fails.

As in the electrical case, the membrane paradigm is useful because these effects should appear all the way down to the event horizon, but are not allowed by GR to be coming &quot;through&quot; the horizon – attributing them to a hypothetical thin radiating membrane at the horizon allows them to be modeled classically without explicitly contradicting general relativity&#x27;s prediction that the event horizon is inescapable.

In 1986, Kip S. Thorne, Richard H. Price and D. A. Macdonald published an anthology of papers by various authors that examined this idea: &quot;Black Holes: The membrane paradigm&quot;.

<text>An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity. EVs encompass a wide range of transportation modes, including road and rail vehicles, electric boats and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.

Early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century, when the Second Industrial Revolution brought forth electrification and mass utilization of DC and AC electric motors. Using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provides a level of quietness, comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time, but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century. Internal combustion engines (both gasoline and diesel engines) were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years, but electricity-powered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as overhead line-powered mass transit vehicles like electric trains, trams, monorails and trolley buses, as well as various small, low-speed, short-range battery-powered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters.

Hybrid electric vehicles, where electric motors are used as a supplementary propulsion to internal combustion engines, became more widespread in the late 1990s. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, where electric motors can be used as the predominant propulsion rather than a supplement, did not see any mass production until the late 2000s, and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market until the 2010s.

Progress in batteries, electric motors and power electronics have made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th century. As a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, and to reduce use of fossil fuels, government incentives are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars and trucks.

== History ==
Electric motive power started in 1827 when Hungarian priest Ányos Jedlik built the first crude but viable electric motor; the next year he used it to power a small model car. In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, built a small-scale electric car, and sometime between 1832 and 1839, Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells. American blacksmith and inventor Thomas Davenport built a toy electric locomotive, powered by a primitive electric motor, in 1835. In 1838, a Scotsman named Robert Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour (6 km/h). In England, a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in 1847.
The first mass-produced electric vehicles appeared in America in the early 1900s. In 1902, the Studebaker Automobile Company entered the automotive business with electric vehicles, though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904. However, with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by Ford Motor Company, the popularity of electric cars declined significantly.

Due to lack of electricity grids and the limitations of storage batteries at that time, electric cars did not gain much popularity; however, electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and achievable speeds. By the 20th century, electric rail transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of electric locomotives. Over time their general-purpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks, forklift trucks, ambulances, tow tractors, and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic British milk float. For most of the 20th century, the UK was the world&#x27;s largest user of electric road vehicles.

Electrified trains were used for coal transport, as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the mines. Switzerland&#x27;s lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network. One of the earliest rechargeable batteriesthe nickel-iron batterywas favored by Edison for use in electric cars.

EVs were among the earliest automobiles, and before the preeminence of light, powerful internal combustion engines (ICEs), electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s. They were produced by Baker Electric, Columbia Electric, Detroit Electric, and others, and at one point in history outsold gasoline-powered vehicles. In 1900, 28 percent of the cars on the road in the US were electric. EVs were so popular that even President Woodrow Wilson and his secret service agents toured Washington, D.C., in their Milburn Electrics, which covered 60–70 miles (100–110  km) per charge.
Most producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of the 20th century, but electric trucks were an established niche well into the 1920s. Several developments contributed to a decline in the popularity of electric cars. Improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars, and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in Texas, Oklahoma, and California led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline/petrol, making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric vehicles were seldom marketed as women&#x27;s luxury car, which may have been a stigma among male consumers. Also, internal combustion-powered cars became ever-easier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. As roads were improved outside urban areas, the electric vehicle range could not compete with the ICE. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gasoline-powered vehicles by Henry Ford in 1913 reduced significantly the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars.

In the 1930s, National City Lines, which was a partnership of General Motors, Firestone, and Standard Oil of California purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with GM buses. The partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies. Still, it was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services.

The Copenhagen Summit, conducted amid a severe observable climate change brought on by human-made greenhouse gas emissions, was held in 2009. During the summit, more than 70 countries developed plans to reach net zero eventually. For many countries, adopting more EVs will help reduce the use of gasoline.

=== Experimentation ===

In January 1990, General Motors President introduced its EV concept two-seater, the &quot;Impact&quot;, at the Los Angeles Auto Show. That September, the California Air Resources Board mandated major-automaker sales of EVs, in phases starting in 1998. From 1996 to 1998 GM produced 1117 EV1s, 800 of which were made available through three-year leases.

Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, and Toyota also produced limited numbers of EVs for California drivers during this period. In 2003, upon the expiration of GM&#x27;s EV1 leases, GM discontinued them. The discontinuation has variously been attributed to:
* the auto industry&#x27;s successful federal court challenge to California&#x27;s zero-emissions vehicle mandate,
* a federal regulation requiring GM to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousand EV1s and
* the success of the oil and auto industries&#x27; media campaign to reduce public acceptance of EVs.

A movie made on the subject in 2005–2006 was titled &quot;Who Killed the Electric Car?&quot; and released theatrically by Sony Pictures Classics in 2006. The film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers, oil industry, the U.S. government, batteries, hydrogen vehicles, and the general public, and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology.

Ford released a number of their Ford Ecostar delivery vans into the market. Honda, Nissan and Toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their EVs, which, like the GM EV1s, had been available only by closed-end lease. After public protests, Toyota sold 200 of its RAV4 EVs; they later sold at over their original forty-thousand-dollar price. Later, BMW of Canada sold off a number of Mini EVs when their Canadian testing ended.

The production of the Citroën Berlingo Electrique stopped in September 2005. Zenn started production in 2006 but ended by 2009.

=== Reintroduction ===

During the late 20th and early 21st century, the environmental impact of the petroleum-based transportation infrastructure, along with the fear of peak oil, led to renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure. EVs differ from fossil fuel-powered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewables such as solar power and wind power, or any combination of those. Recent advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have addressed many of the earlier barriers to EV adoption, making electric vehicles a more viable option for a wider range of consumers.

The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. The electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery, flywheel, or supercapacitors. Vehicles using internal combustion engines usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources, usually non-renewable fossil fuels. A key advantage of electric vehicles is regenerative braking, which recovers kinetic energy, typically lost during friction braking as heat, as electricity restored to the on-board battery.

== Electricity sources ==
There are many ways to generate electricity, of varying costs, efficiency and ecological desirability.
=== Connection to generator plants ===
* Direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains, trams, trolleybuses, and trolleytrucks (See also: overhead lines, third rail and conduit current collection) 
* Online electric vehicle collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through electromagnetic induction

=== Onboard generators and hybrid EVs ===

* Generated on-board using a diesel engine: diesel–electric locomotive and diesel–electric multiple unit (DEMU)
* Generated on-board using a fuel cell: fuel cell vehicle
* Generated on-board using nuclear energy: nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers
* Renewable sources such as solar power: solar vehicle

It is also possible to have hybrid EVs that derive electricity from multiple sources, such as:
* On-board rechargeable electricity storage system (RESS) and a direct continuous connection to land-based generation plants for purposes of on-highway recharging with unrestricted highway range
* On-board rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source (internal combustion engine): plug-in hybrid

For especially large EVs, such as submarines, the chemical energy of the diesel–electric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor. The nuclear reactor usually provides heat, which drives a steam turbine, which drives a generator, which is then fed to the propulsion. &quot;See Nuclear marine propulsion.&quot;

A few experimental vehicles, such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity.

=== Onboard storage ===

These systems are powered from an external generator plant (nearly always when stationary), and then disconnected before motion occurs, and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed.
* Full Electric Vehicles (FEV). Power storage methods include:
** Chemical energy stored on the vehicle in on-board batteries: Battery electric vehicle (BEV) typically with a lithium-ion battery
** Kinetic energy storage: flywheels
** Static energy stored on the vehicle in on-board electric double-layer capacitors

Batteries, electric double-layer capacitors and flywheel energy storage are forms of rechargeable on-board electricity storage systems. By avoiding an intermediate mechanical step, the energy conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions. Furthermore, electro-chemical batteries conversions are reversible, allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form.

== Lithium-ion battery ==


Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries (Li-Ions or LIBs). Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density, longer life span, and higher power density than most other practical batteries. Complicating factors include safety, durability, thermal breakdown, environmental impact, and cost. Li-ion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently.

Increasing the battery&#x27;s lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact. One technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets.

In the past, nickel–metal hydride batteries were used in some electric cars, such as those made by General Motors. These battery types are considered outdated due to their tendencies to self-discharge in the heat. Furthermore, a patent for this type of battery was held by Chevron, which created a problem for their widespread development. These factors, coupled with their high cost, has led to lithium-ion batteries leading as the predominant battery for EVs.

The prices of lithium-ion batteries have declined dramatically over the past decade, contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles, but an increase in the price of critical minerals such as lithium from 2021 to the end of 2022 has put pressure on historical battery price decreases.

== Electric motor ==

The power of a vehicle&#x27;s electric motor, as in other machines, is measured in kilowatts (kW). Electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide RPM range. This means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kW electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kW internal combustion engine, which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed.

Efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on the type of charger, and energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy.

Usually, direct current (DC) electricity is fed into a DC/AC inverter where it is converted to alternating current (AC) electricity and this AC electricity is connected to a 3-phase AC motor.

For electric trains, forklift trucks, and some electric cars, DC motors are often used. In some cases, universal motors are used, and then AC or DC may be employed. In recent production vehicles, various motor types have been implemented; for instance, induction motors within Tesla Motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt.

== Energy and motors ==
Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wires. Electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking, in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of, usually, a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines. This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations, as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending. This regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles.

In the systems above, motion is provided by a rotary electric motor. However, it is possible to &quot;unroll&quot; the motor to drive directly against a special matched track. These linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation. This allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track. In addition to the high-performance control systems needed, switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors, which to date has restricted their operations to high-speed point to point services.

== Vehicle types ==

It is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric power-train.

=== Ground vehicles ===
==== Pure-electric vehicles ====

A pure-electric vehicle or all-electric vehicle is powered exclusively through electric motors. The electricity may come from a battery (battery electric vehicle), solar panel (solar vehicle) or fuel cell (fuel cell vehicle).

==== Hybrid EVs ====

There are different ways that a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and the internal combustion engine. The most common type is a parallel hybrid that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling. In this scenario, the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly. Series hybrids only use the electric motor to drive the wheels and can often be referred to as extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) or range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs). There are also series-parallel hybrids where the vehicle can be powered by the engine working alone, the electric motor on its own, or by both working together; this is designed so that the engine can run at its optimum range as often as possible.

==== Plug-in electric vehicle ====


A plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle that can be recharged from any external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the Rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.

==== Range-extended electric vehicle ====

A range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) is a vehicle powered by an electric motor and a plug-in battery. An auxiliary combustion engine is used only to supplement battery charging and not as the primary source of power.

==== On- and off-road EVs ====
On-road electric vehicles include electric cars, electric trolleybuses, electric buses, battery electric buses, electric trucks, electric bicycles, electric motorcycles and scooters, personal transporters, neighborhood electric vehicles, golf carts, milk floats, and forklifts. Off-road vehicles include electrified all-terrain vehicles and electric tractors.

==== Railborne EVs ====

The fixed nature of a rail line makes it relatively easy to power EVs through permanent overhead lines or electrified third rails, eliminating the need for heavy onboard batteries. Electric locomotives, electric multiple units, electric trams (also called streetcars or trolleys), electric light rail systems, and electric rapid transit are all in common use today, especially in Europe and Asia.

Since electric trains do not need to carry a heavy internal combustion engine or large batteries, they can have very good power-to-weight ratios. This allows high speed trains such as France&#x27;s double-deck TGVs to operate at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph) or higher, and electric locomotives to have a much higher power output than diesel locomotives. In addition, they have higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration, and using regenerative brakes can put braking power back into the electrical grid rather than wasting it.

Maglev trains are also nearly always EVs.

There are also battery electric passenger trains operating on non-electrified rail lines.

=== Seaborne EVs ===

Electric boats were popular around the turn of the 20th century. Interest in quiet and potentially renewable marine transportation has steadily increased since the late 20th century, as solar cells have given motorboats the infinite range of sailboats. Electric motors can and have also been used in sailboats instead of traditional diesel engines. Electric ferries operate routinely. Submarines use batteries (charged by diesel or gasoline engines at the surface), nuclear power, fuel cells or Stirling engines to run electric motor-driven propellers. Fully electric tugboats are being used in Auckland, New Zealand (June 2022), Vancouver, British Columbia (October 2023), and San Diego, California.

=== Airborne EVs ===
Since the beginnings of aviation, electric power for aircraft has received a great deal of experimentation. Currently, flying electric aircraft include piloted and unpiloted aerial vehicles.

=== Electrically powered spacecraft ===

Electric power has a long history of use in spacecraft. The power sources used for spacecraft are batteries, solar panels and nuclear power. Current methods of propelling a spacecraft with electricity include the arcjet rocket, the electrostatic ion thruster, the Hall-effect thruster, and Field Emission Electric Propulsion.

==== Space rover vehicles ====

Crewed and uncrewed vehicles have been used to explore the Moon and other planets in the Solar System. On the last three missions of the Apollo program in 1971 and 1972, astronauts drove silver-oxide battery-powered Lunar Roving Vehicles distances up to on the lunar surface. Uncrewed, solar-powered rovers have explored the Moon and Mars.

== Records ==

* Rimac Nevera, an electric hypercar, set 23 world speed records in one day.
* Fastest acceleration of an electric car, 0 to 100 km/h in 1.461 seconds by university students at the University of Stuttgart.
* Electric Land Speed Record .
* Electric Car Distance Record in 24 hours by Bjørn Nyland. 
* Greatest distance by electric vehicle, single charge .
* Solar-powered EV is fastest EV to go over 1,000 km without stopping to recharge, the Sunswift 7.
* Electric Motorcycle: under 24 hours. Michel von Tell on a Harley LiveWire.
* Electric flight: without charge.

== Properties ==
=== Components ===
The type of battery, the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size, power and proposed application, which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair, through pedelecs, electric motorcycles and scooters, neighborhood electric vehicles, industrial fork-lift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles.

=== Energy sources ===
EVs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct emissions. At the same time, they do rely on electrical energy that is generally provided by a combination of non-fossil fuel plants and fossil fuel plants. Consequently, EVs can be made less polluting overall by modifying the source of electricity. In some areas, persons can ask utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy.

Fossil fuel vehicle efficiency and pollution standards take years to filter through a nation&#x27;s fleet of vehicles. New efficiency and pollution standards rely on the purchase of new vehicles, often as the current vehicles already on the road reach their end-of-life. Only a few nations set a retirement age for old vehicles, such as Japan or Singapore, forcing periodic upgrading of all vehicles already on the road.

=== Batteries ===
An electric-vehicle battery (EVB) in addition to the traction battery specialty systems used for industrial (or recreational) vehicles, are batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric vehicle (BEVs). These batteries are usually a secondary (rechargeable) battery, and are typically lithium-ion batteries.

Traction batteries, specifically designed with a high ampere-hour capacity, are used in forklifts, electric golf carts, riding floor scrubbers, electric motorcycles, electric cars, trucks, vans, and other electric vehicles.

=== Charging ===
==== Grid capacity ====
If almost all road vehicles were electric it would increase global demand for electricity by up to 25% by 2050 compared to 2020. However, overall energy consumption and emissions would diminish because of the higher efficiency of EVs over the entire cycle, and the reduction in energy needed to refine fossil fuels.

==== Charging stations ====
==== Battery swapping ====
Instead of recharging EVs from electric sockets, batteries could be mechanically replaced at special stations in a few minutes (battery swapping).

Batteries with greater energy density such as metal-air fuel cells cannot always be recharged in a purely electric way, so some form of mechanical recharge may be used instead. A zinc–air battery, technically a fuel cell, is difficult to recharge electrically so may be &quot;refueled&quot; by periodically replacing the anode or electrolyte instead.

==== Electric roads ====
An electric road system (ERS) is a road which supplies electric power to vehicles travelling on it. Common implementations are overhead power lines above the road, ground-level power supply through conductive rails, and dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) through resonant inductive coils or inductive rails embedded in the road. Overhead power lines are limited to commercial vehicles while ground-level rails and inductive power transfer can be used by any vehicle, which allows for public charging through a power metering and billing systems. Of the three methods, ground-level conductive rails are estimated to be the most cost-effective.

===== National electric road projects =====
Government studies and trials have been conducted in several countries seeking a national electric road network.

Korea was the first to implement an induction-based public electric road with a commercial bus line in 2013 after testing an experimental shuttle service in 2009, but it was shut down due to aging infrastructure amidst controversy over the continued public funding of the technology.

United Kingdom municipal projects in 2015 and 2021 found wireless electric roads financially unfeasible.

Sweden has been performing assessments of various electric road technologies since 2013 under the Swedish Transport Administration electric road program. After receiving electric road construction offers in excess of the project&#x27;s budget in 2023, Sweden pursued cost-reduction measures for either wireless or rail electric roads. The project&#x27;s final report was published in 2024, which recommended against funding a national electric road network in Sweden as it would not be cost-effective, unless the technology was adopted by its trading partners such as by France and Germany.

Germany found in 2023 that the wireless electric road system (wERS) by Electreon collects 64.3% of the transmitted energy, poses many difficulties during installation, and blocks access to other infrastructure in the road. Germany trialed overhead lines in three projects and reported they are too expensive, difficult to maintain, and pose a safety risk.

France found similar drawbacks for overhead lines as Germany did. France began several electric road pilot projects in 2023 for inductive and rail systems. Ground-level power supply systems are considered the most likely candidates.

=== Other in-development technologies ===

Conventional electric double-layer capacitors are being worked on to achieve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, offering almost unlimited lifespans and no environmental issues. High-K electric double-layer capacitors, such as EEStor&#x27;s EESU, could improve lithium ion energy density several times over if they can be produced. Lithium-sulphur batteries offer . Sodium-ion batteries promise with only minimal expansion/contraction during charge/discharge and a very high surface area, and rely on lower cost materials than Lithium-ion, Leading to Cheaper batteries that do not require critical minerals.

=== Safety ===

The United Nations in Geneva (UNECE) has adopted the first international regulation (Regulation 100) on safety of both fully electric and hybrid electric cars, with the intent of ensuring that cars with a high voltage electric power train, such as hybrid and fully-electric vehicles, are as safe as combustion-powered cars. The EU and Japan have already indicated that they intend to incorporate the new UNECE Regulation in their respective rules on technical standards for vehicles.

=== Environmental ===

EVs release no tailpipe air pollutants, and reduce respiratory illnesses such as asthma. However, EVs are charged with electricity that may be generated by means that have health and environmental impacts.

The carbon emissions from producing and operating an EV are in the majority of cases less than those of producing and operating a conventional vehicle. EVs in urban areas almost always pollute less than internal combustion vehicles.

One limitation of the environmental potential of EVs is that simply switching the existing privately owned car fleet from ICEs to EVs will not free up road space for active travel or public transport. Electric micromobility vehicles, such as e-bikes, may contribute to the decarbonisation of transport systems, especially outside of urban areas which are already well-served by public transport.

Internal combustion engined vehicles use far more raw materials over their lifetime than EVs.

==== Lithium-ion batteries ====
Since their first commercial release in 1991, lithium-ion batteries have become an important technology for achieving low-carbon transportation systems. Information regarding the sustainability of production process of batteries has become a politically charged topic.

Business processes of raw material extraction in practice raise issues of transparency and accountability of the management of extractive resources. In the complex supply chain of lithium technology, there are diverse stakeholders representing corporate interests, public interest groups and political elites that are concerned with outcomes from the technology production and use. One possibility to achieve balanced extractive processes would be the establishment of commonly agreed standards on the governance of technology worldwide.

The compliance of these standards can be assessed by the Assessment of Sustainability in Supply Chains Frameworks (ASSC). Hereby, the qualitative assessment consists of examining governance and social and environmental commitment. Indicators for the quantitative assessment are management systems and standards, compliance and social and environmental indicators.

One source estimates that over a fifth of the lithium and about 65% of the cobalt needed for electric cars will be from recycled sources by 2035. On the other hand, when counting the large quantities of fossil fuel non-electric cars consume over their lifetime, electric cars can be considered to dramatically reduce raw-material needs.

In 2022, the manufacturing of an EV emitted on average around 50% more CO2 than an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle, but this difference is more than offset by the much higher emissions from the oil used in driving an internal combustion engine Vehicle over its lifetime compared to those from generating the electricity used for driving the EV.

In 2023, Greenpeace issued a video criticizing the view that EVs are &quot;silver bullet for climate&quot;, arguing that the construction phase has a high environmental impact. For example, the rise in SUV sales by Hyundai almost eliminate the climate benefits of passing to EV in this company, because even electric SUVs have a high carbon footprint as they consume much raw materials and energy during construction. Greenpeace proposes a mobility as a service concept instead, based on biking, public transport and ride sharing.

Open-pit nickel mining has led to environmental degradation and pollution in developing countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia. In 2024, nickel mining and processing was one of the main causes of deforestation in Indonesia. Open-pit cobalt mining has led to deforestation and habitat destruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

=== Socio-economic ===
A 2003 study in the United Kingdom found that &quot;[p]ollution is most concentrated in areas where young children and their parents are more likely to live and least concentrated in areas to which the elderly tend to migrate,&quot; and that &quot;those communities that are most polluted and which also emit the least pollution tend to be amongst the poorest in Britain.&quot; A 2019 UK study found that &quot;households in the poorest areas emit the least NOx and PM, whilst the least poor areas emitted the highest, per km, vehicle emissions per household through having higher vehicle ownership, owning more diesel vehicles and driving further.&quot;

=== Mechanical ===
Electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90% energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled. They can also be combined with regenerative braking systems that have the ability to convert movement energy back into stored electricity. This can be used to reduce the wear on brake systems (and consequent brake pad dust) and reduce the total energy requirement of a trip. Regenerative braking is especially effective for start-and-stop city use.

They can be finely controlled and provide high torque from stationary-to-moving, unlike internal combustion engines, and do not need multiple gears to match power curves. This removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters.

EVs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines. While this is a desirable attribute, it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind, elderly and very young pedestrians. To mitigate this situation, many countries mandate warning sounds when EVs are moving slowly, up to a speed when normal motion and rotation (road, suspension, electric motor, etc.) noises become audible.

Electric motors do not require oxygen, unlike internal combustion engines; this is useful for submarines and for space rovers.

=== Energy resilience ===
Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources; therefore, it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience.

=== Energy efficiency ===
EV &#x27;tank-to-wheels&#x27; efficiency is about a factor of three higher than internal combustion engine vehicles. Energy is not consumed while the vehicle is stationary, unlike internal combustion engines which consume fuel while idling. In 2022, EVs enabled a net reduction of about 80 Mt of GHG emissions, on a well to-wheels basis, and the net GHG benefit of EVs will increase over time as the electricity sector is decarbonised.

Well-to-wheel efficiency of an EV has less to do with the vehicle itself and more to do with the method of electricity production. A particular EV would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were switched from fossil fuels to renewable energy, such as wind power, tidal power, solar power, and nuclear power. Thus, when &quot;well-to-wheels&quot; is cited, the discussion is no longer about the vehicle, but rather about the entire energy supply infrastructurein the case of fossil fuels this should also include energy spent on exploration, mining, refining, and distribution.

The lifecycle analysis of EVs shows that even when powered by the most carbon-intensive electricity in Europe, they emit less greenhouse gases than a conventional diesel vehicle.

=== Total cost ===
 the purchase price of an EV is often more, but the total cost of ownership of an EV varies wildly depending on location and distance travelled per year: in parts of the world where fossil fuels are subsidized, lifecycle costs of diesel or gas-powered vehicle are sometimes less than a comparable EV.

European carmakers face significant pressure from more affordable Chinese models and price cuts by US-based Tesla Motor. From 2021 to 2022, the European market share of Chinese EV manufacturers doubled to almost 9%, prompting the CEO of Stellantis to describe it as an &quot;invasion&quot;.

=== Range ===

Electric vehicles may have shorter range compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines, which is why the electrification of long-distance transport, such as long-distance shipping, remains challenging.

In 2022, the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the United States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the United Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in China.

=== Heating of EVs ===
Well insulated cabins can heat the vehicle using the body heat of the passengers. This is not enough, however, in colder climates as a driver delivers only about 100 W of heating power. A heat pump system, capable of cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter, is an efficient way of heating and cooling EVs. For vehicles which are connected to the grid, battery EVs can be preheated, or cooled, with little or no need for battery energy, especially for short trips. Most new electric cars come with heat pumps as standard.

== Electric public transit efficiency ==

Shifts from private to public transport (train, trolleybus, personal rapid transit or tram) have the potential for large gains in efficiency in terms of an individual&#x27;s distance traveled per kWh.

Research shows people prefer trams to buses, because they are quieter and more comfortable and perceived as having higher status. Therefore, it may be possible to cut liquid fossil fuel consumption in cities through the use of electric trams. Trams may be the most energy-efficient form of public transportation, with rubber-wheeled vehicles using two-thirds more energy than the equivalent tram, and run on electricity rather than fossil fuels.

In terms of net present value, they are also the cheapestBlackpool trams are still running after 100 years, but combustion buses only last about 15 years.

==Accident rate==
Research published in the British Medical Journal indicates that electric cars hit pedestrians at twice the rate of petrol or diesel vehicles due to being quieter.

==Government incentivization==
The IEA suggests that taxing inefficient internal combustion engine vehicles could encourage adoption of EVs, with taxes raised being used to fund subsidies for EVs. Government procurement is sometimes used to encourage national EV manufacturers. Many countries will ban sales of fossil fuel vehicles between 2025 and 2040.

Many governments offer incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles, with the goals of reducing air pollution and oil consumption. Some incentives intend to increase purchases of electric vehicles by offsetting the purchase price with a grant. Other incentives include lower tax rates or exemption from certain taxes, and investment in charging infrastructure.

Companies selling EVs have partnered with local electric utilities to provide large incentives on some electric vehicles.

== Future ==
=== Public perception ===
A European survey based on climate found that as of 2022, 39% of European citizens tend to prefer hybrid vehicles, 33% prefer petrol or diesel vehicles, followed by electric cars which were preferred by 28% of Europeans. 44% Chinese car buyers are the most likely to buy an electric car, while 38% of Americans would opt for a hybrid car, 33% would prefer petrol or diesel, while only 29% would go for an electric car.

In a 2023 survey concentrated specifically on electric car ownership in the US, 50% of respondents planning to purchase a future car considered themselves unlikely to seriously consider buying an EV. The survey also found that support for banning the production of non-electric vehicles in the US by 2035 has declined from 47% to 40%. 
=== Environmental considerations ===

By reducing types of air pollution, such as nitrogen dioxide, EVs could prevent hundreds of thousands of early deaths every year, especially from trucks and traffic in cities.

The full environmental impact of electric vehicles includes the life cycle impacts of carbon and sulfur emissions, as well as toxic metals entering the environment.

Rare-earth metals (neodymium, dysprosium) and other mined metals (copper, nickel, iron) are used by EV motors, while lithium, cobalt, manganese are used by the batteries. In 2023 the US State Department said that the supply of lithium would need to increase 42-fold by 2050 globally to support a transition to clean energy. Most of the lithium-ion battery production occurs in China, where the bulk of energy used is supplied by coal burning power plants. A study of hundreds of cars on sale in 2021 concluded that the life cycle GHG emissions of full electric cars are slightly less than hybrids and that both are less than gasoline and diesel fuelled cars. 
An alternative method of sourcing essential battery materials being deliberated by the International Seabed Authority is deep sea mining, however carmakers are not using this as of 2023.

=== Improved batteries ===
Advances in lithium-ion batteries, driven at first by the personal-use electronics industry, allow full-sized, highway-capable EVs to travel nearly as far on a single charge as conventional cars go on a single tank of gasoline. Lithium batteries have been made safe, can be recharged in minutes instead of hours (see recharging time), and now last longer than the typical vehicle (see lifespan). The production cost of these lighter, higher-capacity lithium-ion batteries is gradually decreasing as the technology matures and production volumes increase. Research is also underway to improve battery reuse and recycling, which would further reduce the environmental impact of batteries.

Many companies and researchers are also working on newer battery technologies, including solid state batteries and alternate technologies.

=== Battery management and intermediate storage ===
Another improvement is to decouple the electric motor from the battery through electronic control, using supercapacitors to buffer large but short power demands and regenerative braking energy. The development of new cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both weak points mentioned above. The cell management involves not only monitoring the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration (one more cell than needed). With sophisticated switched wiring, it is possible to condition one cell while the rest are on duty.

=== Electric trucks ===
=== Hydrogen trains ===
Particularly in Europe, fuel-cell electric trains are gaining in popularity to replace diesel-electric units. In Germany, several Länder have ordered Alstom Coradia iLINT trainsets, in service since 2018, with France also planning to order trainsets. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Canada and Mexico are equally interested. In France, the SNCF plans to replace all its remaining diesel-electric trains with hydrogen trains by 2035. In the United Kingdom, Alstom announced in 2018 their plan to retrofit British Rail Class 321 trainsets with fuel cells.

===Higher voltage outlets in garages of newly built homes===
In New Mexico the government is looking to pass legislation mandating electrical receptacles that are higher voltage to be installed in garages of newly built homes. The NEMA 14-50 outlets provide 240 volts and 50 Amps for a total of 12.5 Kilowatts for level 2 charging of electric vehicles. Level 2 charging can add up to 30 miles of range per hour of charging compared to up to 4 miles of range per hour for level 1 charging from 120 volt outlets.

=== Bidirectional charging ===
General Motors (GM) is adding a capability called V2H, or bidirectional charging, to allow its new electric vehicles to send power from their batteries to the owner&#x27;s home. GM will start with 2024 models, including the Silverado and Blazer EVs, and promises to continue the feature through to model year 2026. This could be helpful to the owner during unexpected power grid outages because an electric vehicle is a giant battery on wheels.

== Infrastructure management ==
With the increase in number of electric vehicles, it is necessary to create an appropriate number of charging stations to supply the increasing demand, and a proper management system that coordinates the charging turn of each vehicle to avoid having some charging stations overloaded with vehicles and others empty.

=== Stabilization of the grid ===

Since EVs can be plugged into the electric grid when not in use, battery-powered vehicles could reduce the need for dispatchable generation by feeding electricity into the grid from their batteries during periods of high demand and low supply (such as just after sunset) while doing most of their charging at night or midday, when there is unused generating capacity. This vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power plants, as long as vehicle owners do not mind reducing the life of their batteries, by being drained by the power company during peak demand. Electric vehicle parking lots can provide demand response.

Current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing shares of variable-output power sources such as wind and solar. This variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which EV batteries are charged, or possibly even discharged.

Some concepts see battery exchanges and battery charging stations, much like gas/petrol stations today. These will require enormous storage and charging potentials, which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging, and to output power during shortage periods, much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grids.

===Repair shops===

<text>Freddo is a chocolate bar brand shaped like an anthropomorphic cartoon frog. It was originally manufactured by the now defunct company MacRobertson&#x27;s, an Australian confectionery company, but is now produced by Cadbury. Some of the more popular flavours include strawberry, pineapple and peppermint.

The product was invented in 1930 by Harry Melbourne, an 18-year-old MacRobertson&#x27;s employee. In 1967, MacRobertson&#x27;s was sold to Cadbury, which incorporated Freddo Frogs into its own product range. The chocolate was originally sold only in Australia, but has been introduced into several other markets.

== History ==

In 1930, the MacRobertson&#x27;s chocolate company were looking to add a new product to their children&#x27;s range. Initial designs for a chocolate mouse were rejected, as Harry Melbourne felt that women and children were afraid of mice and would dislike the product. It was instead decided to produce a chocolate frog, branded as &quot;Freddo Frog&quot;. There were four varieties available: milk chocolate, white chocolate, half milk/half white, and milk chocolate with peanuts.

Freddo Frogs became part of the Cadbury product range in 1967, when MacRobertson&#x27;s was sold to Cadbury. In Australia, Freddo Frogs are manufactured in Ringwood, Victoria and Claremont, Tasmania. Since the success of Freddo, an alternative chocolate named Caramello Koala (formerly Caramello Bear), also made by Cadbury, has been created. Caramello Koala is the only flavour in which the chocolate is not shaped like &quot;Freddo&quot;.
Freddo bars were released onto the UK market in 1973, turning over £2 million a year by 1974, before being withdrawn in 1979. They were re-launched in 1994 after 15 years. In the UK, a caramel-filled version is also sold, with a yellow wrapper. This was formerly known as the Taz bar, featuring the Looney Tunes character. They disappeared for several years before returning under the Freddo image.

In June 2006, a scare over possible salmonella contamination in some Cadbury products in the UK led to the recall of around a million Cadbury chocolate bars, including the standard Freddo. As a result of the contamination, Cadbury was fined £1 million, and ordered to pay an additional £152,000 in costs.

In 2009, the Freddo chocolate was redesigned in the United Kingdom, featuring a new, glossier Freddo design, and a replacement Dairy Milk logo. The same year saw the launch of an online animated series on the product&#x27;s website.

=== Inflation ===
In the United Kingdom, the price of Freddo is informally used to measure the cost of living and inflation rates, with each generation comparing a different price. The original Freddo bars were 2p when they were launched in the UK in 1973, but they were withdrawn in 1979. When Freddo bar was relaunched in the 1990s, it was priced at 10p. The price of a Freddo remained at 10p until 2005, when the price of a Freddo bar has roughly increased in price by 2p a year, with the 2016 selling price being 25p. In 2017, the price of Freddos increased to 30p, double the price adjusted for inflation (15p), compared to its launch price (10p). This led to public criticism and outrage across social media platforms. For one week in January 2019, the British supermarket Tesco reduced the price of Freddo to the nostalgic price of 10p as part of their centenary celebrations. The price of a Freddo in 2022 was as much as 49p.

== Varieties ==
Though primarily available as solid milk chocolate fingers, certain versions of the product have a cream, caramel, or other centred flavouring. These include Dairy Milk, white chocolate, rice crisp, strawberry, peppermint, &quot;Crunchie&quot;, pineapple, popping candy, &quot;Rainbow Crunch&quot; and &quot;Milky Top&quot; (the top half being white chocolate and the bottom milk chocolate, in the style of Cadbury&#x27;s &quot;Top Deck&quot; products). Limited edition ‘twin’ freddo were also sold in Australia, with one side filled with lemonade and the other with raspberry. Milky Top Freddo, along with the Giant Caramello Koala, was the brain-child of then Australian brand manager Jesse Karjalainen.

<text>Quality Comics was an American comic book publishing company which operated from 1937 to 1956 and was a creative, influential force in what historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comic Books.

Notable, long-running titles published by Quality include &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, &quot;Feature Comics&quot;, &quot;G.I. Combat&quot;, &quot;Heart Throbs&quot;, &quot;Military Comics&quot;/&quot;Modern Comics&quot;, &quot;Plastic Man&quot;, &quot;Police Comics&quot;, &quot;Smash Comics&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit&quot;. While most of their titles were published by a company named Comic Magazines, from 1940 onwards all publications bore a logo that included the word &quot;Quality&quot;. Notable creators associated with the company included Jack Cole, Reed Crandall, Will Eisner, Lou Fine, Gill Fox, Paul Gustavson, Bob Powell, and Wally Wood.

==History==
Quality Comics was founded by Everett M. Arnold, a printer who saw the rapidly rising popularity of the comic book medium in the late 1930s. Deducing that Depression-era audiences wanted established quality and familiar comic strips for their hard-earned dimes, in 1937 the enterprising Arnold formed Comic Favorites, Inc. (in collaboration with three newspaper syndicates: the McNaught Syndicate, the Frank J. Markey Syndicate, and Iowa&#x27;s Register and Tribune Syndicate).

Comic Favorites, Inc.&#x27;s first publication was &quot;Feature Funnies&quot;, which began primarily with color reprints of hit strips from all three co-owning syndicates (including &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, &quot;Mickey Finn&quot;, and &quot;Dixie Dugan&quot; [all three from McNaught]) alongside a small number of original features. The original material came from various sources, including the company&#x27;s in-house staff and freelancers (from the first issue) and the Eisner &amp; Iger shop (from issue #3).

A frequent point of confusion is whether and how comic packaging shop Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler was involved with the company&#x27;s early days. Several sources list Chesler as the publisher of &quot;Feature Funnies&quot;, but the only primary source to mention Chesler is an interview with Arnold in which he describes purchasing content from the shop for &quot;Military Comics&quot; and &quot;Police Comics&quot;, neither of which began until 1941. An interview with Will Eisner quoted in &quot;The Quality Companion&quot; indicates that Arnold did not always own Comic Favorites, Inc., but the authors of that reference were unable to find any corroborating evidence amidst a large volume of evidence to the contrary.

In 1939, Arnold and the owners of the Register &amp; Tribune Syndicate&#x27;s parent company, brothers John Cowles Sr. and Gardner Cowles Jr., bought out the McNaught and Markey interests. Arnold became 50% owner of the newly formed Comic Magazines, Inc., the corporate entity that would publish the Quality Comics line. That year Quality released &quot;Smash Comics&quot; #1 (Aug. 1939), the company&#x27;s first comic book with exclusively new material.

Initially buying features from Eisner &amp; Iger, a prominent &quot;packager&quot; that produced comics on demand for publishers entering the new medium, Quality introduced such superheroes as Plastic Man and Kid Eternity, and non-superhero characters including the aviator hero Blackhawk. Quality also published comic-book reprints of Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit&quot;, the seven-page lead feature in a weekly 16-page, tabloid-sized, newsprint comic book, known colloquially as &quot;The Spirit Section&quot;, distributed through Sunday newspapers.

The name Quality Comics debuted on the cover of &quot;Crack Comics&quot; #5 (Sept. 1940; see at right). &quot;Seemingly never an official publishing title,&quot; the Connecticut Historical Society noted, &quot;the Quality Comics Group is a trademarked name (presumably taking its name from Stamford&#x27;s nickname of &#x27;the Quality City&#x27;) encompassing Comic Favorites Inc., E.M. Arnold Publications, Smash Comics, and any other imprints owned by Arnold&quot;. A 1954 federal document noted that the Quality Romance Group, owned by Everett M. and Claire C. Arnold, with an office at 347 Madison Avenue, in New York City, published two titles as Arnold Publications, Inc., two titles as Comic Favorites, Inc., and 14 titles as Comic Magazines, Inc.

By the mid-1950s, with television and paperback books drawing readers away from comic books in general and superheroes in particular, interest in Quality&#x27;s characters had declined considerably. After a foray into other genres such as war, humor, romance and horror, the company ceased operations with comics cover-dated December 1956.

==Continuation of characters at other publishers==
Many of Quality&#x27;s character and title trademarks were sold to National Comics Publications (now DC Comics), which chose to keep only four series running: &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, &quot;G.I. Combat&quot;, &quot;Heart Throbs&quot; (each for another 100 or more issues), and &quot;Robin Hood Tales&quot; (for 8 issues). 

There has been much confusion over whether the original Quality Comics and their characters are in public domain. The original copyrights for Quality&#x27;s publications were never renewed, leaving them in the public domain. The trademarks to the characters were sold to DC, which has periodically published stories with them to renew copyright.

Over the decades, DC revived other Quality characters. Plastic Man has starred in several short-lived series starting in 1966, as well as a Saturday morning cartoon from 1979–1981. The character went on to become a member of the Justice League in the 1990s.

According to DC canon, the Quality characters, before the 1985-1986 DC revamping event called &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, existed on two separate realities in the DC Multiverse: Earth-Quality and Earth-X. While Earth-Quality followed much the same history as the main Earths, Earth-X was radically different from most Earths, in that World War II continued there until 1973, enabling the Freedom Fighters to continue their fight against the Nazis. Following the Crisis, the Quality characters are transported to the main universe.

New, successor versions of the characters Black Condor and The Ray were introduced in 1992. Both were recruited into the Justice League. The new Ray had his own 1994–1996 series and occasionally appears as a reserve Justice League member. Yet another version of the Ray was introduced in 2011.

Some Quality Comics titles, including &quot;Blackhawk&quot; and &quot;Plastic Man&quot;, have been reprinted by DC, while lesser-known ones have been reprinted by AC Comics.

<doc id="279532" wikidata="Q3029177" url="?curid=279532" title="Geography of the Soviet Union">
<text>The [[Soviet Union]] incorporated an area of over , covering approximately one-sixth of Earth&#x27;s land surface. It spanned most of Eurasia. Its largest and most populous republic was the Russian SFSR which covered roughly three-quarters of the surface area of the union, including the complete territory of contemporary Russia.

The Soviet Union was the world&#x27;s largest country throughout its entire existence (1922–1991). It had a geographic center further north than all independent countries other than Canada, Iceland, Finland, and the countries of Scandinavia. About three-quarters of the country was above the 50th parallel north.

==Geographical particulars==
===Area===
The country&#x27;s 22,402,200 square kilometers (8,649,537.8 sq mi) included one-sixth of the Earth&#x27;s land surface. Its western portion covered more than half of the land area of Europe, but only a quarter of the total land area of the Soviet Union. This area was where the majority (about 72 percent) of the people lived and where most industrial and agricultural activities were concentrated. It was here, roughly between the Dnieper River and the Ural Mountains, that its predecessor, the Russian Empire, took shape and gradually over centuries expanded to the Pacific Ocean and into Central Asia. After the Russian Civil War, the newly formed Soviet Union took control over most of the empire&#x27;s former territories.

===Borders and neighbors===
The Soviet Union had the longest borders of any contemporary country, extending approx. . They measured some 10,000 kilometers (6,213.7 mi) from Kaliningrad on Gdańsk Bay in the west to Ratmanova Island (Big Diomede Island) in the Bering Strait - the rough equivalent of the distance from Edinburgh, Scotland, westwards to Nome, Alaska. From the tip of the Taymyr Peninsula on the Arctic Ocean to the Central Asian town of Kushka near the Afghan border extended almost 5,000 kilometers (3,106.8 mi) of mostly rugged, inhospitable terrain. The east–west expanse of the United States would easily have fit between the northern and southern borders of the Soviet Union at their extremities.

The Soviet Union had sixteen countries along its nearly 20,000 kilometers (12,427.4 mi) of land borders.

In Asia it had neighbors (from east to west) in:
* Japan (1922–1945)
* North Korea
* China
* Mongolia
* Afghanistan
* Iran
* Turkey

In Europe it had borders with (from south to north):
* Romania
* Hungary
* Czechoslovakia
* Poland
* Lithuania (1939–40, 1991)
* Latvia (1922–40, 1991)
* Estonia (1922–40, 1991)
* Finland
* Norway

===Seacoast===
Soviet shorelines were contiguous with a dozen seas and part of the water systems of three oceans — the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific. More than two-thirds of its borders were seacoast, making it the world&#x27;s longest coastal boundary during its time. More than two-thirds of the coastline were well above the Arctic Circle. With the important exception of Murmansk, which received the warm currents of the Gulf Stream, the coast north of the Arctic Circle was usually locked in ice, frozen for up to ten months each year. Despite the extensive coastline, access to the world&#x27;s oceans was both difficult and expensive.

In addition to having the world&#x27;s longest coastline, the U.S.S.R. had the longest frontiers. To the north the country was bounded by the seas of the Arctic Ocean, and to the east were the seas of the Pacific. On the south the U.S.S.R. was bordered by North Korea, Mongolia, China, Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. On the southern frontier there were three seas: the Caspian Sea, the world&#x27;s largest inland sea, as well as the almost completely landlocked Black Sea and Sea of Azov. Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, and Norway lay to the west.

==Topography and drainage==
Most geographers divide the vast Soviet territory into five natural zones that generally extend from west to east: the tundra zone; the taiga or forest zone; the steppe or plains zone; the arid zone; and the mountain zone. Most of the Soviet Union consisted of three plains (East European Plain, West Siberian Plain, and Turan Lowland), two plateaus (Central Siberian Plateau and Kazakh Upland), and a series of mountainous areas, concentrated for the most part in the extreme northeast or extending intermittently along the southern border. The West Siberian Plain, the world&#x27;s largest, extended east from the Urals to the Yenisey River. Because the terrain and vegetation were uniforms in each of the natural zones, the Soviet Union, as a whole, presented an illusion of uniformity.

===Tundra===
Nevertheless, the Soviet territory contained all the major vegetation zones with the exception of tropical rain forest. Ten percent of Soviet territory is tundra, that is, a treeless marshy plain. The tundra was the Soviet Union&#x27;s northernmost zone of snow and ice, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Bering Strait in the east and then running south along the Pacific coast to the earthquake and volcanic region of northern Kamchatka Peninsula. It was the land made famous by herds of wild reindeer, by white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and by days of total darkness in winter. The long harsh winters and lack of sunshine allowed only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although the great Siberian rivers slowly traversed this zone in reaching the Arctic Ocean, drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps was hampered by partial and intermittent thawing. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, shaping a landscape modified by extensive glaciation in the last ice age.

===Forests===

The northern forests of spruce, fir, pine, and larch, collectively known as the taiga, made up the largest natural zone of the Soviet Union, an area about the size of the United States. Here too the winter is long and severe, as witnessed by the routine registering of the world&#x27;s coldest temperatures for inhabited areas in the northeastern portion of this belt. The taiga zone extended in a broad band across the middle latitudes, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Verkhoyansk Range in northeastern Siberia and as far south as the southern shores of Lake Baykal. Isolated sections of taiga are found along mountain ranges, as in the southern part of the Urals, and in the Amur River Valley in the Far East. About 33 percent of the population lives in this zone, which, with the mixed forest zone, included most of the European part of the Soviet Union and the ancestral lands of the earliest Slavic settlers.

===Steppes===
Long associated with traditional images of Russian landscape and cossacks on horseback are the steppes, which are treeless, grassy plains. Although they covered only 15 percent of Soviet territory, the steppes were home to roughly 44 percent of the population. They extend for 4,000 kilometers from the Carpathian Mountains in the western Ukrainian Republic across most of the northern portion of the Kazakh Republic in Soviet Central Asia, between the taiga and arid zones, occupying a relatively narrow band of plains whose chernozem soils are some of the most fertile on earth. In a country of extremes, the steppe zone, with its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture, provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture. Even here, however, agricultural yields were sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts.

===Arid zone===
Below the steppes, and merging at times with them, was the arid zone: the semideserts and deserts of Soviet Central Asia and, particularly, of the Kazakh Republic. Portions of this zone became cotton- and rice-producing regions through intensive irrigation. For various reasons, including sparse settlement and a comparatively mild climate, the arid zone became the most prominent center for Soviet space exploration.
One-quarter of the Soviet Union consisted of mountains or mountainous terrain. With the significant exceptions of the Ural Mountains and the mountains of eastern Siberia, the mountains occupy the southern periphery of the Soviet Union. The Urals, because they have traditionally been considered the natural boundary between Europe and Asia and because they are valuable sources of minerals, were the most famous of the country&#x27;s nine major ranges. In terms of elevation (comparable to the Appalachians) they do not serve as a formidable natural barrier.

===Alpine terrain===
Truly alpine terrain was found in the southern mountain ranges. Between the Black and Caspian seas, for example, the Caucasus Mountains rose to impressive heights, marking a continuation of the boundary separating Europe from Asia. One of the peaks, Mount Elbrus, is the highest point in Europe at 5,642 meters. This range, extending to the northwest as the Crimean and Carpathian mountains and to the southeast as the Tien Shan and Pamirs, formed an imposing natural barrier between the Soviet Union and its neighbors to the south. The highest point in the Soviet Union, at 7,495 meters, was Mount Communism (Pik Kommunizma) in the Pamirs near the border with Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The Pamirs and the Tien Shan were offshoots of the tallest mountain chain in the world, the Himalayas. Eastern Siberia and the Soviet Far East are also mountainous regions, especially the volcanic peaks of the long Kamchatka Peninsula, which jutted down into the Sea of Okhotsk. The Soviet Far East, the southern portion of Soviet Central Asia, and the Caucasus were the Soviet Union&#x27;s centers of seismic activity. In 1887, for example, a severe earthquake destroyed the city of Verny (present-day Almaty), and in December 1988 a massive quake demolished the Armenian city of Spitak and large sections of Kirovakan and Leninakan. The 1988 quake, one of the worst in Soviet history, claimed more than 25,000 lives.

===Hydrosystems===
The Soviet Union possessed both scarce and abundant water resources. With about 3 million rivers and approximately 4 million inland bodies of water, the Soviet Union held the largest fresh, surface-water resources of any country. But most of these resources (84 percent), as with so much of the Soviet resource-base, lay at a great distance from the majority of potential users; they flowed through sparsely populated territory and into the Arctic and Pacific oceans. In contrast, areas with the highest concentrations of the population (and therefore the highest demand for water supplies) tended to have the warmest climates and highest rates of evaporation. This resulted in barely adequate (or in some cases inadequate) water-resources in the areas of most need.

Nonetheless, as in many other countries, the earliest settlements sprang up on the rivers, where the majority of the urban population preferred to live. The Volga, Europe&#x27;s longest river, became by far the Soviet Union&#x27;s most important commercial waterway. Three of the country&#x27;s twenty-three cities with more than one million inhabitants stood on its banks: Gorky, Kazan, and Kuybyshev.

The European part of the Soviet Union had extensive, highly developed, and heavily used water-resources, among them the key hydrosystems of the Volga, Kama, Dnepr, Dnestr, and Don rivers. As with fuels, however, the greatest water resources lay east of the Urals, deep in Siberia. Of the sixty-three rivers in the Soviet Union longer than 1,000 kilometers, forty were east of the Urals, including the four mighty rivers that drain Siberia as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean: the Irtysh, Ob&#x27;, Yenisey, and Lena rivers. The Amur River formed part of the winding and even at times there are tense boundaries between the Soviet Union and People&#x27;s Republic of China. Taming and exploiting the hydroelectric potential of these systems became a monumental and highly publicized Soviet project. Some of the world&#x27;s largest hydroelectric stations operated on these rivers. Hundreds of smaller hydroelectric power-plants and associated reservoirs were also constructed on the rivers. Thousands of kilometers of canals linked river- and lake-systems and provided essential sources of irrigation for farmland.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s four million inland bodies of water chiefly resulted from extensive glaciation. Most prominently they included the Caspian Sea, the world&#x27;s largest inland sea, and Lake Baikal, the world&#x27;s deepest and most capacious freshwater lake. Lake Baikal alone held 85 percent of the freshwater resources of the lakes in the Soviet Union and 20 percent of the world&#x27;s total. Other water resources included swampland - a sizable portion of territory (10 percent) - and glaciers in the northern areas.

===Extreme points===

North: Cape Fligely, Russian SFSR (81&#x27;30 N) South: Serhetabat, Turkmen SSR (35&#x27;12 N) West: Narmeln, Russian SFSR, (19&#x27;38 E) East: Dezhnev (Big Diomede), Russian SFSR, (169&#x27;01 W).

==Climate==

===Winter&#x27;s impact===
Notorious cold and long winters have been the focus of discussions on the Soviet Union&#x27;s weather and climate. From the frozen depths of Siberia came baby mammoths perfectly preserved, locked in ice for several thousand years. Millions of square kilometers experience half a year of subfreezing temperatures and snow covered over subsoil that was permanently frozen in places to depths of several hundred meters. In northeastern Siberia, not far from Yakutsk, hardy settlers coped with January temperatures that consistently average . Transportation routes, including entire railroad lines, had been redirected in winter to traverse rock-solid waterways and lakes.

Howling Arctic winds that produced coastal wind chills as low as and the burany, or blinding snowstorms of the steppe, were climatic manifestations of the USSR&#x27;s close proximity to the North Pole and remoteness from oceans that tended to moderate the climate. A combination of the &quot;Siberian high&quot;: cold, high-pressure systems in the east, together with wet, cold cyclonic systems in the west largely determined the overall weather patterns.

The long, cold winter had a profound impact on almost every aspect of life in the Soviet Union. It affected where and how long people live and work and what kinds of crops are grown and where they are grown (no part of the country has a year-round growing season). The length and severity of the winter, along with the sharp fluctuations in the mean summer and winter temperatures, imposed special requirements on many branches of the economy: in regions of permafrost, buildings must be constructed on pilings, and machinery must be made of specially tempered steel; transportation systems must be engineered to perform reliably in extremely low and high temperatures; the health care field and the textile industry are greatly affected by the ramifications of six to eight months of winter; and energy demands are multiplied by extended periods of darkness and cold.

===Other climatic zones===
Despite its well-deserved reputation as a generally snowy, icy northern country, the Soviet Union included other major climatic zones as well. According to Soviet geographers, most of their country is located in the temperate zone, which for them included all of the European portions except the southern part of Crimea and the Caucasus, all of Siberia, the Soviet Far East, and the plains of Soviet Central Asia and the southern Kazakh Republic.

Two areas outside the temperate zone demonstrated the climatic diversity of the Soviet Union: the Soviet Far East, under the influence of the Pacific Ocean, with a monsoonal climate; and the subtropical band of territory extending along the southern coast of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most popular resort area, Crimea, through the Caucasus and into Soviet Central Asia, where there were deserts and oases.

With most of the land so far removed from the oceans and the moisture they provide, levels of precipitation in the Soviet Union was low to moderate. More than half the country received fewer than forty centimeters of rainfall each year, and most of Soviet Central Asia and northeastern Siberia could count on barely one-half that amount. The wettest parts were found in the small, lush subtropical region of the Caucasus and in the Soviet Far East along the Pacific coast.

== Land and natural resources ==
The Soviet resource base was by far the world&#x27;s most extensive, ensuring self-sufficiency for its people in most resources for many years. The Soviet Union was usually first or second in the annual production of most of the world&#x27;s strategic raw materials. However, most of the topography and climate resembles that of the northernmost portion of the North American continent. The northern forests and the plains to the south find their closest counterparts in the Yukon Territory and in the wide swath of land extending across most of Canada. Similarities in terrain, climate, and settlement patterns between Siberia and Alaska and Canada are unmistakable.

===Land status===
Only 11 percent of the USSR&#x27;s land was arable. 16 percent was meadows and pasture. 41 percent was forest and woodland. Of the remaining, much is permafrost or tundra. However, the Soviet Union was richly endowed with almost every major category of natural resource. Drawing upon its vast holdings, it became the world leader in the production of oil, iron ore, manganese, and asbestos; it had the world&#x27;s largest proven reserves of natural gas as well as coal, iron ore, timber, gold, manganese, lead, zinc, nickel, mercury, potash, phosphates, and most strategic minerals.

Self-sufficiency had traditionally been a powerful stimulus for exploring and developing the country&#x27;s huge, yet widely dispersed, resource base. It remained a source of national pride that the Soviet Union, alone among the industrialized countries of the world, could claim the ability to satisfy almost all the requirements of its economy using its own natural resources. The abundance of fossil fuels supplied not just the Soviet Union&#x27;s domestic needs. For many years, an ample surplus was exported to consumers in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, where it earned most of the Soviet Union&#x27;s convertible currency.

===Resources in Siberia===
Although its historical, political, economic, and cultural ties bound it firmly to Europe, the Soviet Union was, with the inclusion of Siberia, also an Asian country. In the post-World War II period, Siberia became known as a new frontier because of its treasure of natural resources. As resource stocks were depleted in the heavily populated European section, tapping the less accessible but vital riches east of the Urals became a national priority. The best example of this process is fuels and energy. The depletion of readily accessible fuel resources west of the Urals caused development and exploitation to shift to the inhospitable terrain of western Siberia, which in the 1970s and 1980s displaced the Volga-Ural and the southern European regions as the country&#x27;s primary supplier of fuel and energy. Fierce cold, permafrost, and persistent flooding made this exploitation costly and difficult.

==Environmental concerns==

The Soviet Union transformed, often radically, the country&#x27;s physical environment. In the 1970s and 1980s, Soviet citizens, from the highest officials to ordinary factory workers and farmers, began to examine negative aspects of this transformation and to call for more prudent use of natural resources and greater concern for environmental protection.

===Before 1985===
In spite of a series of environmental laws and regulations passed in the 1970s, authentic environmental protection in the Soviet Union did not become a major concern until General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in March 1985. Without an established regulatory agency and an environmental protection infrastructure, enforcement of existing laws was largely ignored. Only occasional and isolated references appeared on such issues as air and water pollution, soil erosion, and wasteful use of natural resources in the 1970s. There were various reasons for not implementing environmental safeguards. In cases where land and industry were state owned and managed when air and water were polluted, the state was most often the agent of this pollution. Second, and this was true especially under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s leadership, the resource base of the country was viewed as limitless and free. Third, in the Cold War rush to modernize and to develop heavy industry, concern for damage to the environment and related damage to the health of Soviet citizens would have been viewed as detrimental to progress. Fourth, advanced means of pollution control and environmental protection can be an expensive, high-technology industry, and even in the mid-1980s many of the Soviet Union&#x27;s systems to control harmful emissions were inoperable or of foreign manufacture.

===1985 and after===
Under Gorbachev&#x27;s leadership, the official attitude toward the environment changed. Various social and economic factors helped produce this change. To maintain economic growth through the 1980s, a period in which the labor force had been declining significantly, intensive and more prudent use of both natural and human resources was required. At the same time, glasnost provided an outlet for widespread discussion of environmental issues, and a genuine grass-roots ecological movement arose to champion causes similar to the ecological concerns of the West. Public campaigns were mounted to protect Lake Baykal from industrial pollution and to halt the precipitous decline in the water levels of the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and, most urgently, the Aral Sea. A large scheme to divert the northern rivers southward had been counted on to replenish these seas, but for both economic and environmental reasons, the project was canceled in 1986.

Without this diversion project, the Aral Sea, once a body of water larger than any of the Great Lakes except Lake Superior, seemed destined to become the world&#x27;s largest salt flat as early as the year 2010. By 1987 so much water had been siphoned off for irrigation of cotton and rice fields south and east of the sea that all shipping and commercial fishing had ceased. Former seaports, active as late as 1973, were reported to be forty to sixty kilometers from the water&#x27;s edge. Belatedly recognizing the gravity of the situation for the 3 million inhabitants of the Aral region, government officials declared it an ecological disaster area.

With respect to air pollution, mass demonstrations protesting unhealthy conditions were held in cities such as Yerevan in the Armenian SSR. Official reports confirmed that more than 100 of the largest Soviet cities registered air quality indexes ten times worse than permissible levels. In one of the most publicized cases, the inhabitants of Kirishi, a city not far from Leningrad, succeeded in closing a chemical plant whose toxic emissions were found to be harming—and in some cases killing—the city&#x27;s residents. Finally, separate, highly publicized cases of man-made disasters, the most prominent of which was the Chernobyl&#x27; nuclear power plant accident in 1986, highlighted the fragility of the main production -nature relationship in the Soviet Union and forced a reconsideration of traditional attitudes and policies toward industrialization and development.

As part of the process of restructuring (perestroika), in the 1980s concrete steps were taken to strengthen environmental protection and to provide the country with an effective mechanism for implementing policy and ensuring compliance. Two specific indications of this were the inclusion of a new section devoted to environmental protection in the annual statistical yearbook and the establishment of the State Committee for the Protection of Nature (Gosudarstvennyi komitet po okhrane prirody—Goskompriroda) early in 1988.

Despite these measures, decades of environmental degradation caused by severe air and water pollution and land abuse are unlikely to be remedied soon or easily. Solving these critical problems will require not only a major redirection of capital and labor but also a fundamental change in the entire Soviet approach to industrial and agricultural production and resource exploitation and consumption.

<text>The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (&quot;ny&quot; means &quot;new&quot; in Danish; &quot;Glyptotek&quot; comes from the Greek root &quot;glyphein&quot;, to carve, and &quot;theke&quot;, storing place), commonly known simply as Glyptoteket, is an art museum in Copenhagen, Denmark. The collection represents the private art collection of Carl Jacobsen (1842–1914), the son of the founder of the Carlsberg Breweries.

Primarily a sculpture museum, as indicated by the name, the focal point of the museum is antique sculpture from the ancient cultures around the Mediterranean, including Egypt, Rome and Greece, as well as more modern sculptures such as a collection of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s works, considered to be the most important outside France. However, the museum is equally noted for its collection of paintings that includes an extensive collection of French impressionists and Post-impressionists as well as Danish Golden Age paintings.

The French Collection includes works by painters such as Jacques-Louis David, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Degas and Cézanne, as well as those by Post-impressionists such as van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec and Bonnard. The museum&#x27;s collection includes all the bronze sculptures of Degas, including the series of dancers. Numerous works by Norwegian-Danish sculptor Stephan Sinding are featured prominently in various sections of the museum.

==History==

===First Glyptoteque===
Carl Jacobsen was a dedicated art collector. He was particularly interested in antique art, but over the years he also acquired a considerable collection of French and Danish sculptures. When his private villa in 1882 was extended with a winter garden, sculptures soon outnumbered plants in it. The same year the collection was opened to the public. In the following years the museum was expanded on a number of occasions to meet the need for more space for his steadily growing collections. In 1885 his &#x27;house museum&#x27; had grown to a total of 19 galleries, the first 14 of which had been designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup while Hack Kampmann had built the last four as well as conducted a redesign of the winter garden.

===New museum===

In spite of the many extensions, it was finally clear the existing premises were inadequate and that a new building was needed. On 8 March 1888 Carl Jacobsen donated his collection to the Danish State and the City of Copenhagen on condition that they provided a suitable building for its exhibition. Copenhagen&#x27;s old fortifications had recently been abandoned and a site was chosen on a ravelin outside &quot;Holcks Bastion&quot; in the city&#x27;s Western Rampart, just south of the Tivoli Gardens which had been founded in 1843. Jacobsen was displeased with the location which he found to be too far from the city centre and he had also reservations about the proximity of Tivoli which he found common. Instead he wanted a building on the emerging new city hall square, yet in the end he accepted.

It was Carl Jacobsen who chose the name for the museum, with inspiration from Ludwig I&#x27;s Glyptothek in Munich, as well as Vilhelm Dahlerup as the architect for the assignment. The moat around the radan was filled and the new museum opened first on 1 May 1897. At first it only included Jacobsen&#x27;s modern collection with French and Danish works from the 18th century.

In January 1899 Carl Jacobsen donated his collection of Antique art to the museum which made an expansion necessary. It was designed by Hack Kampmann while Dahlerup designed a winter garden which connected the new wing to the old building. It was inaugurated in 1906.

In 1996 the museum was once again extended, this time with an infill constructed in one of its courtyards to the design of Henning Larsen. In 2006, the building underwent a major renovation programme under the direction of Danish architects Dissing + Weitling. and Bonde Ljungar Arkitekter MAA.

==Architecture==
The building is often noted for its elegance in its own right and the synthesis it creates with the works of art.

The Dahlerup Wing, the oldest part of the museum, is a lavish historicist building. The façade is in red brick with polished granite columns in a Venetian renaissance style. It houses the French and Danish collections.

The Kampmann Wing is a more simple, neo-classical building, built as a series of galleries around a central auditorium used for lectures, small concerts, symposiums and poetry readings.

The two wings are connected by the Winter Garden with mosaic floors, tall palms, a fountain and topped by a dome made in copper and wrought iron.

The Henning Larsen Wing is a minimalistic infill, built in a former inner courtyard and affording access to the roof.
Official meetings and banquets sometimes take place in the Glyptotek, such as the certification of Polio-free Europe, 21 June 2002.

==Collections==
The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek&#x27;s collections comprise more than 10,000 works of art.

===Antique collection===

The Egyptian Collection comprises more than 1,900 pieces, dating from 3000 BCE to the 1st century CE and representing both Ancient Egypt, the Middle Kingdom and the Roman Period. It was founded in 1882 when Carl Jacobsen made his first Egyptian acquisition, a Sarcophagus purchased from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Many of the objects in the collection were augmented when the Ny Carlsberg Foundation sponsored excavations in Egypt in the beginning of the 20th century led by the English Egyptologist W. M. F. Petrie . The holdings include several mummies, displayed in a crypt-like gallery below the normal galleries.

The Near Eastern Collection spans a period of 7150 years, the oldest artifact being from 6500 BCE and the youngest being from 650 CE, featuring such cultures as the Levant, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Persia.

The main focus of the French Collection is 19th-century French painting and sculpture. The painting collection contains works by such painters as David and Manet, as well as a large collection of Impressionist painters such as Monet, Cézanne and Bonnard. The single painter represented with most paintings is Paul Gauguin with more than 40 works. The museum also holds a large collection of French 19th-century sculpture by artists such as Carpeaux and Rodin, the Rodin collection being one of the largest in the world, as well as a complete collection of Degas&#x27; bronze sculptures.

<doc id="279548" wikidata="Q778307" url="?curid=279548" title="Don Clarke">
<text>Donald Barry Clarke (10 November 1933 – 29 December 2002) was a New Zealand rugby union player who played 89 times (31 of these were test matches) as a New Zealand international from 1956 until 1964. He was best known for his phenomenal goal kicking ability that earned him the nickname &quot;The Boot&quot;. He was born at the small settlement of Pihama, near Ōpunake in the Taranaki Region.

==Rugby career==

Clarke was first selected to play rugby for at the age of 17 in 1951. In 1956 he helped the Waikato side to a 14–10 victory over the touring South African Springbok side. This helped his cause in being selected to play in the third All Black test match of the Springbok tour. Over his entire All Black career Clarke scored 781 points, a record that stood for 24 years until it was broken by Grant Fox in 1988.

Clarke had four brothers, Ian, Douglas, Brian and Graeme all of whom also represented Waikato. Only once did they all appear for Waikato in the same match, at Te Aroha in 1961.

A highlight of his career was to play for the Eastwood Rugby Club (Sydney, Australia) in an exhibition match. &quot;One of the best days of my life&quot; Clarke commented at the after match function. In July 1965 Clarke also helped Hornsby Rugby beat Mosman at Waitara Oval by scoring a try and demonstrating his kicking skills by kicking two penalties and three conversions.

==Cricket career==

Clarke also played 27 first-class cricket matches as a right-arm opening bowler, mostly for Auckland and Northern Districts, taking five or more wickets in an innings on four occasions. His best performance came for Northern Districts against Central Districts in January 1963, when he claimed 8/37 in the second innings.
At the time, this was a record innings return for Northern Districts in first-class cricket, although it was beaten by Gren Alabaster&#x27;s 8/30 just two months later.

==Personal life==

Clarke married in 1962 in Morrinsville. In 1977 he moved to South Africa, together with wife Patsy, son Glen and daughters Leigh and Shelley. There he set up a tree-felling business. In 1997, he was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident, when a 15-tonne truck hit his utility vehicle. He was diagnosed with melanoma in March 2001, from which he died on 29 December 2002.

<doc id="279551" wikidata="Q1195760" url="?curid=279551" title="Battle of Changping">
<text>The Battle of Changping () was a military campaign during the Warring States period of ancient China, which took place from 262 to 260 BC at Changping (northwest of present-day Gaoping, Shanxi), between the two strongest military powers, the State of Qin and the State of Zhao. After a bitter two-year stalemate, the battle ended in a decisive victory for Qin forces and the ruthless execution of most of the Zhao captives, resulting in an unrecoverable loss of manpower and strategic reserve for the Zhao state.

This battle is infamous for being one of the bloodiest battles in human history, also sometimes considered &quot;one of the bloodiest battles of antiquity&quot;, because several hundred thousand soldiers were buried alive. The main historical records for the events of this period is sourced from the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, written more than a century later, which estimated roughly 450,000 dead on the Zhao side and 250,000 dead on the Qin side. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (685–762) later built a temple over a collection of some of the human remains, and scattered bones and mass graves continue to be discovered on the site today.

==Prelude==
In 265 BC, Qin attacked the State of Han and captured Qinyang, which effectly cut off Han&#x27;s Shangdang Commandery (in modern-day Changzhi, Shanxi province) from its southern heartland (in modern western Henan), making Shangdang an isolated northern exclave. Within the following years, the Qin army further isolated Shangdang from Han by capturing the crucial mountain passes and fortresses across the Taihang Mountains, and Shangdang was poised to fall.

Rather than seeing Shangdang being taken by Qin, Shangdang&#x27;s governing commander, Feng Ting, decided to offer the region to Zhao. Shangdang was a productive and strategically important region just west of Zhao&#x27;s capital Handan, and its capture would allow Qin easy incursions north and west into Zhao territory, so King Xiaocheng of Zhao () accepted and dispatched senior general Lian Po to lead an army and secure the region from the encroaching Qin.

==Battle==
===Early skirmishes===
In 262 BC, the Qin army, led by Wang He, invaded Shangdang, and Feng Ting had to evacuate the commandery. The Zhao army also mobilized, and after arriving at the front line, Lian Po set up three defensive lines pivoted south of Changping Pass (at the border between present-day Gaoping and Zhangzi County).

In April, the Zhao army first encountered the Qin army west of Gaoping Pass (at the border between present-day Gaoping and Qinshui County, Shanxi) on Lian Po&#x27;s first defensive line, and suffered several defeats during initial confrontations with the Qin vanguards. The Qin army killed the Zhao commander in Gaoping and quickly capitalized on the momentum of these successes, capturing Gaoping Pass as well as three other Zhao strongholds nearby, and the first defensive line collapsed. Having assessed the enemy&#x27;s strength, Lian Po concluded the only way to counter the Qin offensive was to avoid field battles and hold the second defensive line along the Dan River (丹水, the largest tributary of Qin River, which traverses the present-day Gaoping city). He started focusing on further reinforcing positions on the east bank of Dan River valley using fortified ramparts built along the mountain foothills, hoping to exhaust the Qin army, as Changping was much farther away from Qin territory than Zhao and keeping the army supplied would be much more taxing to the Qin due to the more rugged and winding mountain routes in the west.

The Qin army did attempt crossing the Dan River and even once managed to breach Lian Po&#x27;s second defensive line, but they did not have enough strength to exploit it and were beaten back. By July, the two sides were forced into a bitter stalemate across the river, which lasted the next two years. Both sides massively reinforced their positions, with total combatants numbering around a million in early 260 BC.

===Change of Zhao strategy===
While Lian Po&#x27;s strategy of holding and wearing out the Qin army was working, problems started to arise back home. The Qin side were frustrated and desperate to break the stalemate, so they sent spies into Zhao and Han to spread rumors that Lian Po was too senile and cowardly to fight. King Xiaocheng of Zhao was already dissatisfied with Po&#x27;s strategy of dragging out the war for so long, which was also very logistically taxing for Zhao, so he decided to replace Lian Po with Zhao Kuo, the overconfident yet untested son of the famous late general Zhao She.

According to &quot;Shiji&quot;, the young Zhao Kuo excelled in reciting military philosophies so much that his father often got flabbergasted in debates. However, on his deathbed Zhao She had told his wife to never let his son command an army, because Kuo regarded wars as easy games and treated risks with hubris rather than caution, despite having never experienced any actual battles. When Zhao Kuo was appointed general, Lady Zhao and minister Lin Xiangru tried to persuade King Xiaocheng to rescind that appointment, but their appeal failed. Lady Zhao however did manage to extract a promise from the king that the Zhao clan would not be punished if Zhao Kuo loses the war.

Upon hearing that the Zhao king fell for the rumor, the Qin secretly replaced Wang He with the renowned general Bai Qi, who was known for being brutally efficient in annihilation battles. The appointment of Bai Qi was highly classified in order to not alarm the Zhao army, and anyone who leaked the news would be punished by death.

===Zhao defeated===
In July 260 BC, Zhao Kuo arrived at Changping and took over command of the Zhao army. He discarded all previous defensive strategies made by his predecessor, and instead decided to take his main force north to quickly cross the Dan River and attack the left flank of the Qin army stationed along the river&#x27;s west bank, hoping a decisive offense would be enough to break the Qin army. In doing so, he left most of the provisions stored at the old main camp further south along the river, which was now relatively undermanned and could not secure the elongated supply line stretched along in front of the Qin army across the river.

Unknown to Zhao Kuo, Bai Qi had anticipated his plan and responded with a maneuver that was later done by Hannibal Barca against the Romans decades later at the Battle of Cannae. Bai Qi had deliberately reduced the strength of his left flank stationed along the river, and had a line of hill fortifications further west of the river reinforced instead. When Zhao Kuo crossed the river and attacked, the Qin left flank quickly abandoned their riverside positions and withdrew back west toward the hills, drawing Zhao Kuo to chase after them. However, a Qin detachment of 25,000 men had then traversed north through the Taiyue Mountains to perform a wide left encirclement behind Zhao&#x27;s third defensive line stapled around the Changping Pass, cutting off Zhao supply lines from the north. At the same time, another detachment of 5,000 light cavalry with bows and crossbows advanced on the right and crossed the Dan River to cut off communications between Zhao Kuo&#x27;s new camp and their southern main depot, splitting the Zhao army into two, and Bai Qi&#x27;s main force immediately followed in to secure and choke off the Dan River valley exits. These detachments eventually completed a triangular encirclement that trapped Zhao Kuo&#x27;s forces around a small mountain range.

Zhao Kuo soon found his attack against the enemy left flank halted by the Qin hill fortifications, unable to make any progress. He then realized that his rear were being ambushed by the Qin cavalry and provisions were quickly running low, and was forced to abandon his offensives and pull back across the river. The Qin army then counterattacked and pursued, inflicting heavy casualties upon Zhao Kuo&#x27;s retreating army. After being unable to reach the friendly forces in the south, the Zhao Kuo&#x27;s army dug in on a hill and had to await relief.

However, since 295 BC, Zhao foreign policy had been dominated by opportunism, and had frequently shifted between &quot;hezong&quot; () (anti-Qin alliances) and &quot;lianheng&quot; () (pro-Qin alliances), depleting its diplomatic goodwill with other states. Therefore, as the battles in Changping unfolded, Zhao was unable to secure any help from either the State of Chu or the State of Qi. King Zhaoxiang of Qin used this opportunity to mobilize additional forces against Zhao from Henei (in modern-day Henan province), by bestowing one grade of noble rank on the population as merits and ordered a nationwide mobilization conscripting every able-bodied man over the age of 15, with the king himself personally overseeing the reserves to the Changping frontline in order to further bolster the encirclement.

With the enemy firmly trapped, Bai Qi started repeatedly launching attacks to further wear out the Zhao army and deny them any chance of escape. Zhao Kuo&#x27;s improvised hill positions were besieged non-stop for 46 days, and by September, with winter nearing, his army&#x27;s struggle for survival grew more desperate, with the starving Zhao soldiers slaughtering all the horses and allegedly even murdering and feeding on each other. The fighting was also so fierce that half of the Qin soldiers were killed in combat, but the exhausted and demoralized Zhao army was ultimately unsuccessful in breaking out. Zhao Kuo was eventually killed by Qin archers and crossbowmen when leading his best troops in a final attempt to breach the encirclement. With their commander dead, the remaining Zhao army gave up and surrendered.

==Aftermath==
Bai Qi wanted to take advantage of the victory and quickly lay siege to Handan, but guarding and feeding the large number of prisoners of war would be a huge burden, and releasing them was out of the question because the newly subdued local population was still hostile to Qin rule and these Zhao captives would likely get reconscripted or participate in revolts. As a one-off solution, Bai Qi ordered the captured Zhao soldiers all to be executed, presumably by being buried alive; only 240 of the youngest soldiers were spared and released back to Zhao to spread terror. Han dynasty historian Sima Qian stated in his chronicle (written about 150 years later) that over 450,000 Zhao soldiers were killed during and after the battle.

However, King Zhaoxiang wanted to delay the offensive so the troopers could rest, turning down Bai Qi&#x27;s request to lay siege upon Handan. In frustration, Bai Qi resigned and refused to lead the army again when the king asked him the following year, citing that the window of opportunity had long passed. King Zhaoxiang was angered by Bai Qi&#x27;s defiance and ordered his death by forced suicide. The Qin army then carried the war into Zhao under other Qin generals, but were met with heavy resistance. Lord Pingyuan of Zhao also successfully procured aid from the states of Chu and Wei, leading to a devastating Qin defeat at the Battle of Handan, which halted the Qin campaigns of expansion for almost three decades.

Long-term, the Battle of Changping had profound consequences. Prior to the campaign, Zhao had been one of the most militarily powerful states of the Warring States and arguably the only one that could resist Qin&#x27;s expansion. Instead, it never recovered from the loss of manpower at Changping. Meanwhile, three years of war had financially and domestically exhausted Qin as well, but within a decade Qin recovered to its full strength and gained complete strategic dominance over the other states. Forty years later in 221 BC, Qin would conquer all other states and unify China under the Qin dynasty.

==In popular culture==
The defeat of Zhao Kuo, who doomed his entire army, led to the Chinese idiom &quot;talking wars on paper&quot; (), referring to someone who is great at theoretical thinking but performs poorly in practice.

The 2004 Chinese television series &quot;Changping of the War&quot; is based on the battle.

The battle also features as background to the events taking place in the manga &quot;Kingdom&quot; with the events having a direct and indirect impact on the character development of several major characters on many sides, most notably Wan Ji of Zhao, who led an army of other survivors and families of those killed in bloody and gory revenge upon Qin citizens. Wang He, the other general, was divided into two different generals, Wang Qi, and Wang He, the former fought on Changping.

Changping is also a major plot point in &quot;The Legend of Haolan&quot;. The catastrophe and chaos in the state of Zhao causes the main characters to flee to Qin.

<text>The Nippon Sei Ko Kai (), abbreviated as NSKK, sometimes referred to in English as the Anglican Episcopal Church in Japan, is the national Christian church representing the Province of Japan (, ) within the Anglican Communion.

As a member of the Anglican Communion the Nippon Sei Ko Kai shares many of the historic doctrinal and liturgical practices of the Church of England, but is a fully autonomous national church governed by its own synod and led by its own primate. The Nippon Sei Ko Kai, in common with other churches in the Anglican Communion, considers itself to be a part of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church and to be both Catholic and Reformed.

With an estimated 80 million members worldwide, the Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches. The Nippon Sei Ko Kai has approximately 32,000 members organised into eleven dioceses and found in local church congregations throughout Japan.

==History==

===Background (1549–1846)===
Jesuit Saint Francis Xavier together with Portuguese explorers and missionaries first brought Christianity to Japan in the 16th century. In 1587, the Christian faith and life were outlawed and Christians, Japanese and foreign, were openly persecuted. In memory of these early Japanese Christians, and in common with the Catholic Church, the Nippon Sei Ko Kai commemorates the Martyrs of Japan every February 5 for their life and witness.

All foreigners were subsequently expelled in 1640 as Japan began two centuries of self-imposed isolation and Christian communities were driven into hiding. When foreigners were eventually allowed back into the main islands of Japan in the 1850s, they found thousands of Christians who had maintained their Christian faith and identity through centuries of persecution.

===Early mission church (1846–1900)===
Anglican church mission work in Japan started with the British Loochoo Naval Mission on the outlying Ryukyu Islands in May 1846. George Jones, a United States Navy chaplain traveling with the Expedition of Commodore Perry, led the first recorded Anglican burial service on Japanese soil at Yokohama on 9 March 1854. More permanent mission priests of the Episcopal Church, John Liggins and Channing Moore Williams, arrived in the treaty port of Nagasaki in May and June 1859. After the opening of the port of Yokohama in June 1859, Anglicans in the foreign community gathered for worship services in the British consul&#x27;s residence. A British consular chaplain, Michael Buckworth Bailey, arrived in August 1862 and after a successful fundraising campaign Christ Church, Yokohama, was dedicated on 18 October 1863.

Due to government restrictions on the teaching of Christianity and a significant language barrier, the religious duties of clergy were initially limited to serving as ministers to the American and British residents of the foreign settlements. The first recorded baptism by Williams of a Japanese convert, a Kumamoto samurai named Shōmura Sukeuemon, was not until 1866.

Liggins and Williams were followed to Nagasaki in January 1869 by George Ensor, a priest representing the Church Mission Society of the Church of England. Following 1874, he was joined by H. Burnside at Nagasaki, C. F. Warren at Osaka, Philip Fyson at Yokohama, J. Piper at Tokyo (Yedo), H. Evington at Niigata and W. Dening at Hokkaido. H. Maundrell joined the Japan mission in 1875 and served at Nagasaki. John Batchelor was a missionary priest to the Ainu people of Hokkaido from 1877 to 1941.

After the Meiji Restoration, significant new legislation relating to the freedom of religion was introduced, facilitating in September 1873, the arrival in Tokyo of Alexander Croft Shaw and William Ball Wright as the first missionary priests sent to Japan by the Society for Propagation of the Gospel. Williams, appointed Episcopal Bishop of China and Japan in 1866, moved first to reside in Osaka in 1869, then subsequently relocated to Tokyo in December 1873.

By 1879, through cooperative work between the various Anglican missions, the largest part of the Book of Common Prayer had been translated and published in Japanese. A full version of the text being completed by 1882. On Palm Sunday 1883, Nobori Kanai and Masakazu Tai, graduates of the Tokyo theological school were ordained by Bishop Williams as the first Japanese deacons in the church. In 1888, the Anglican Church of Canada also began missionary work in Japan, later mainly focusing on Nagoya and Central Japan.

In addition to the work of ordained church ministers, much of the positive public profile enjoyed by Anglican Church in Japan during this early mission period was due to the work of lay missionaries working to establish schools, universities and medical facilities. Significant among this group were missionary women such as Ellen G. Eddy at St. Agnes&#x27; School in Osaka, Alice Hoar at St. Hilda&#x27;s School and Florence Pitman at St. Margaret&#x27;s School, both located in Tokyo. Hannah Riddell who established the Kaishun Hospital for people with leprosy in Kumamoto and Mary Cornwall-Legh who ran a similar facility in Kusatsu, Gunma, were both honored by the Japanese Government for their work.

The first synod of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai met in Osaka in February 1887. At this meeting, instigated by Bishop Edward Bickersteth and presided over by Bishop Williams, it was agreed to unite the various Anglican missionary efforts in Japan into one autonomous national church; the Nippon Sei Ko Kai. The 17 European and American participants at the first Synod were outnumbered by 14 other clergy and 50 Japanese lay delegates.

Total Nippon Sei Ko Kai church membership in 1887 was estimated to be 1,300. John Toshimichi Imai, ordained deacon in 1888 and raised to the priesthood by Bishop Bickersteth in 1889, was the first Japanese person to become an ordained Anglican priest.

In 1890, J. G. Waller, a Canadian Anglican priest, arrived in Japan with his wife Lydia. 1892, they moved to Nagano where he established churches in Nagano City in 1898, which was nationally registered as an important tangible cultural property in 2006. Waller helped establish a tuberculosis sanatorium in Obuse, Nagano funded by donations from Anglicans in Canada.

===Continued growth and wartime challenges (1900–1945)===

By 1906 the Nippon Sei Ko Kai was reported to have grown to 13,000 members, of whom 6,880 were communicants with a Japanese led ordained ministry of 42 priests and 22 deacons. Henry St. George Tucker, President of St. Paul&#x27;s College and in 1913 appointed Bishop of Kyoto, was one of the foremost missionary leaders of the period who advocated that an independent, Japanese-led and self-supporting church was the only way in which Christianity could be carried to the wider population of Japan. Initiatives were put in place to help grow the financial self-sufficiency of church congregations and the first Japanese bishops, John Yasutaro Naide, Bishop of Osaka and Joseph Sakunoshin Motoda, Bishop of Tokyo, were consecrated in 1923.

During the 1930s, as overseas funding and the number of foreign Anglican missionaries in Japan declined, new challenges arose for Nippon Sei Ko Kai church leadership and laity from the increasing focus on Shinto as a state prescribed religion and the growing influence of militarism in domestic and foreign policy. Christianity was portrayed by many nationalist politicians at the time as incompatible with the loyalty of Japanese subjects. In response the Nippon Sei Ko Kai issued periodic statements in support of the Imperial Army. And the first half of the 20th century saw NSKK&#x27;s overseas expansion. Taiwan Sheng Kung Hui was established, several Japanese-language churches, such as Dalian Sheng Kung Hui Church, were built in Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui&#x27;s Northern China Diocese in Manchuria, and the Anglican Church of Korea was absorbed by the NSKK.

A more active period of government persecution began in 1937, particularly for Christian denominations such as the Salvation Army with its commitment to social reform, and for the NSKK with its historic links to the Church of England. Archbishop Lang&#x27;s condemnation in October of Imperial Japanese Army actions in China, provoked hostile scrutiny of the NSKK and caused some in the church leadership to publicly disassociate themselves from links with the wider Anglican Communion.

During World War II, the majority of Protestant churches in Japan were forcibly brought together by the Japanese wartime government to form the United Church of Christ in Japan, or Kyodan. Reflecting the distinctive doctrinal character of the Anglican Communion, many individual Nippon Sei Ko Kai congregations refused to join. The cost of resistance to and non-cooperation with the government&#x27;s religious policies was harassment by the military police and periods of imprisonment for church leaders such as Bishops Samuel Heaslett, Hinsuke Yashiro and Todomu Sugai, as well as Primate Paul Shinji Sasaki.

St. Andrew&#x27;s Tokyo, now the Cathedral church for the Diocese of Tokyo, was one such congregation that resisted government pressure, struggling to retain its land, church buildings and Anglican identity to the war&#x27;s end in 1945. However, like many urban Nippon Sei Ko Kai churches, medical and educational facilities, St. Andrew&#x27;s buildings were lost in the 1945 Allied incendiary bombing.

===Post-war period (1945–)===
The pressure of an extended war caused damage to both internal church unity and the physical infrastructure of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai. Seventy-one out of a total of 246 churches had been destroyed. Others were in bad repair due to neglect, requisition by the military, or vandalism.

Through individual and larger communal acts of reconciliation, and with the support of an Anglican Commission sent out by the Church of England&#x27;s Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher in 1946, the Nippon Sei Ko Kai was organizationally reordered in 1947, with a leadership consisting of Japanese bishops at the head of each diocese.

Attending the 1948 Lambeth Conference, Presiding Bishop Yashiro took with him a finely embroidered silk cope and mitre and presented it to Archbishop Fisher as a gesture of thanks from members of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai for the bonds of fellowship that continued to hold members of the Anglican Communion together in the aftermath of wartime hostilities. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, wore the cope at the opening service of the Lambeth Conference that year and again in 1953 at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

The Nippon Sei Ko Kai became a financially self-supporting Province of the Anglican Communion in 1972.

Adopting a formal Statement of War Responsibility at the General Synod in 1996, and reflecting on the Japanese occupation of China and Korea prior to the Second World War, the NSKK has been active in multi-year projects promoting peace, reconciliation, and youth exchange programs between East Asian nations.

Two decades after becoming the first woman deacon, Margaret Ryoko Shibukawa was ordained the first woman priest in the Nippon Sei Ko Kai in December 1998.

The Nippon Sei Ko Kai celebrated the 150th anniversary of continuous Anglican Christian witness in Japan in 2009. The occasion was marked with a series of church and community events and visits by both the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America at the time, Katharine Jefferts Schori.

In 2013 the NSKK co-hosted with the Anglican Church of Korea the 2nd Worldwide Anglican Peace Conference in Okinawa.

The NSKK is a member of the National Christian Council in Japan.

Nathaniel Makoto Uematsu, Bishop of Hokkaido was the primate of the Anglican Church in Japan from 23 May 2006 until November 2020.

Luke Kenichi Muto, Bishop of Kyushu, was installed as the Primate of Nippon Sei Ko Kai on 5 November 2020. He was succeeded in 2024 by Bishop David Eisho Uehara of Okinawa. 

Today the Nippon Sei Ko Kai continues its traditions of ministry and Christian witness in Japan through church congregational life, hospitals, schools, social advocacy, and support for non-profit organizations.

The church, at both a national and local level, works to support disadvantaged, marginalized, or discriminated against communities in Japan, as well as communities in Tohoku impacted by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake, tsunami and subsequent crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear generating plant.

The NSKK also engages in field-based mission work overseas, such as in the Philippines.

Eight of the NSKK&#x27;s dioceses ordain women to the diaconate and priesthood. The NSKK has ordained women to the priesthood since 1998. Women have been ordained to the diaconate since 1978, and the first woman to be ordained a deacon and, later, as a priest was Margaret Shibukawa Ryoko. In 2021, the Diocese of Hokkaido elected Grace Trazu Sasamori as bishop, making her the first woman to be elected bishop in the church.

===Worship===
The Book of Common Prayer used in worship is the &quot;Ki Tō Sho&quot; (日本聖公会祈祷書, 1959) that includes in its latest 2000 revision the Lord&#x27;s Prayer wording, common between the Nippon Sei Ko Kai (NSKK) and the Catholic Church in Japan.

The Bible reading at the church is now mostly from the Japan Bible Society Interconfessional Version (2018), replacing the Japanese New Interconfessional Translation Bible (1987).

The Japanese Hymns Ancient and Modern has been replaced by &quot;Sei Ka Shū&quot;, the NSKK Hymnal (日本聖公会聖歌集, 2006).

==Dioceses and notable churches==
There are currently eleven dioceses in the Nippon Sei Ko Kai and over three hundred church and chapel congregations spread across the country. Notable churches in each diocese from north to south include:



===Hokkaido===
The Anglican mission to Hokkaido was pioneered since 1874 by the Rev. Walter Dening and the Rev. John Batchelor, who contributed to the welfare and education of the Ainu people. More than 130 years since then, the Anglicans in the Diocese of Hokkaido, with its diocesan cathedral at Christ Church Cathedral, Sapporo, have made unique contributions in various fields, establishing 24 churches, 5 kindergartens and 4 nursery schools.

The bishop is Maria Grace Tazu Sasamori (笹森田鶴) since 2022, NSKK&#x27;s first female bishop.

===Tohoku===
The first Anglican-Episcopal mission to the Tohoku Region, i.e. Northeast Japan, of Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Miyagi, Yamagata and Fukushima Prefectures started in 1891 when the missionary team was sent to Fukushima by Bishop John McKim of the Diocese of North Tokyo (now the Diocese of Kitakanto). In 1894, the Rev. H.J. Jefferies was sent to Sendai, the largest city of the Region, his missionary activities including the church meetings, sewing schools, kindergartens, and Sunday schools. The church building in Sendai was completed in 1905, at which time Bishop N. S. Binstead of the Episcopal Church USA arrived as the bishop of the Diocese of Tohoku. 

Just before and during Pacific War, foreighn missionaries were forced to leave and the NSKK was dissolved. However, it rose from the difficult war-time and postwar period, and developed into a self-sufficient diocese. The building of the Christ Church in Sendai was burned down in the 1945 Bombing of Sendai, was rebuilt in 1965, and was rebuilt again in 2014. 

===Kitakanto===
The first Anglican-Episcopal mission in the Diocese of North Tokyo (now the Diocese of Kitakanto, with St. Mattias&#x27; Cathedral in Maebashi, covering NSKK churches in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama Prefectures) was to Kawagoe in 1878. From Kawagoe, the mission spread to other cities. In 1893, the first bishop of the diocese, John McKim, was installed. 

In 1901, the first kindergaten in Saitama Prefecture opened as the NSKK church-affiliated kindergarten in Kawagoe. In 1916, Conwall Legh started the medical care unit of leprosy patients in Kusatsu, Gunma. The facility of the Society of St John the Evangelist was transferred to the diocese and used as the Koyama House of Prayer since 2004. 

The current Bishop of the Diocese of Kitakanto is Francis Xavier Hiroyuki Takahashi (髙橋宏幸) interim bishop (管理主教).

===Tokyo===
The Diocese of Tokyo was established in its modern form in May 1923. There are 33 churches and 9 chapels in the Diocese, many having been first established in the second half of the nineteenth century. 
*St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Minato-ku, Tokyo
*St. Alban&#x27;s, Minato-ku, Tokyo, an English language based NSKK congregation located adjacent to St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral.

*Christ Church, Yokohama landmark church located in Yamate overlooking the Port of Yokohama, hosting both English and Japanese language based congregations.
* St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Kiyosato, Yamanashi

===Chubu===
The Diocese of Chubu, with its diocesan cathedral at St. Matthew&#x27;s Church Cathedral, Nagoya, covers the parishes and other facilities in the four prefectures of the Chubu Region (meaning &quot;Central Japan&quot;): Aichi, Gifu, Nagano, and Niigata. For historical reasons, the parishes in Fukui, Ishikawa and Toyama Prefectures of Japan&#x27;s Chubu Region belong to the Diocese of Kyoto, and those in Yamanashi and Shizuoka Prefectures, to the Diocese of Yokohama.

The diocese of Chubu was established with the help of Anglican Church of Canada. The Nagano Holy Saviour Church, Nagano, nationally Registered Important Tangible Cultural Property from 2006, was built by J. G. Waller, a Canadian missionary. The origin of St. Mary&#x27;s College, Nagoya goes back to the Child care workers&#x27; school established by Margaret Young (1855 - 1940), another missionary from Anglican Church of Canada.

The bishop of the diocese is the Rt. Rev&#x27;d Dr. Renta Nishihara (西原廉太), ordained in October 2020 as the tenth bishop.

<text>A cream tea (also known as a Devon cream tea, Devonshire tea, or Cornish cream tea) is an afternoon tea consisting of tea, scones, clotted cream (or, less authentically, whipped cream), jam, and sometimes butter. Cream teas are sold in tea rooms throughout England, especially Devon and Cornwall, and in some other parts of the Commonwealth.

== History ==
The origin of the cream tea is disputed, although there is evidence to suggest that the tradition of eating bread with cream and jam existed at Tavistock Abbey in Devon in the 11th century. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; reports the earliest use of &quot;cream tea&quot; in the sense of the afternoon tea, as opposed to a cup of tea with cream in it, is in the 1964 novel &quot;Picture of Millie&quot; by Philip Maitland Hubbard, &quot;We just bathe and moon about and eat cream teas.&quot; However, the &quot;Foods of England&quot; website has discovered an earlier newspaper cutting, &quot;The Cornishman&quot; of Thursday, 3 September 1931 (p. 8), which uses the phrase in what appears to be its modern sense: &quot;For an alleged Cornish cream tea consisting of three slices of bread and butter, a splashing of cream and jam and two anemic rolls, I was charged 1s. 6d.&quot;

== Variations ==
There are regional variations as to how a cream tea should preferably be eaten. 
*The Devonian, or Devonshire, method is to split the scone in two, cover each half with clotted cream, and then add strawberry jam on top. The Devon method is also commonly used in neighbouring counties. 
*With the Cornish method, the warm &#x27;split&#x27; or a &#x27;scone&#x27; is first split in two, then spread with strawberry jam, and finally topped with a spoonful of clotted cream. This method is also used elsewhere, notably in London.

Although these distinctions on whether to apply the jam or the clotted cream to the scone first are still claimed by many, cream teas are served and enjoyed both cream first and jam first throughout both counties.

Scones are rarely buttered in commercially available teas. Traditionally it is important that the scones be warm (ideally, freshly baked), and that clotted (rather than whipped) cream and strawberry jam, rather than any other variety, be used. Butter is generally not included, and some sources advise that the tea should not be served with milk.

In Cornwall an alternative was traditionally a &quot;split&quot;, a type of slightly sweet white bread roll, rather than a scone. It is now rare to find this available commercially, even in Cornwall, but splits are still used by many Cornish families in their own homes. In Devon, an alternative to the scone found occasionally is the &quot;Devon split&quot; or &quot;Chudleigh&quot;, lighter than a scone and smaller than a Cornish split.

Another variation to a cream tea is called &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;, which consists of a round of bread or a Cornish split, topped with clotted cream and honey or golden syrup.

Yet another variation is a &quot;savoury cream tea&quot;, with cheese scones; cream cheese instead of clotted cream, and chutney instead of jam.

== Protected status ==
In May 2010, a campaign was launched at the Devon County Show to have the name &quot;Devon cream tea&quot; protected within the European Union under Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) rules. The campaign was launched following discussion on BBC Radio Devon.

<text>A scone ( or ) is a traditional British baked good, popular in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is usually made of either wheat flour or oatmeal, with baking powder as a leavening agent, and baked on sheet pans. A scone is often slightly sweetened and occasionally glazed with egg wash. The scone is a basic component of the cream tea. It differs from teacakes and other types of sweets that are made with yeast. Scones were chosen as Ireland&#x27;s representative for Café Europe during the Austrian presidency of the European Union in 2006, while the United Kingdom chose shortbread.

== Lexicology ==

The pronunciation of the word within the English-speaking world varies, with some pronouncing it (rhymes with &quot;gone&quot;), and others (rhymes with &quot;tone&quot;). The dominant pronunciation differs by area. Pronunciation rhyming with &quot;tone&quot; is strongest in the English Midlands and Ireland, though it seems to have less prominent patches in Cornwall and Essex. The pronunciation rhyming with &quot;gone&quot; is strongest in Northern England and Scotland, although this also seems to be the favoured pronunciation in Southern England, the Home Counties, and East Anglia. Natives of Ireland and the United States mainly use the pronunciation. British dictionaries usually show the form as the preferred pronunciation, while recognising the form.

The difference in pronunciation is alluded to in a poem:
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; reports that the first mention of the word was in 1513.

===Etymology===
The origin of the word &quot;scone&quot; is obscure and may derive from several sources. That is, the classic Scottish &quot;scone&quot;, the Dutch &quot;schoonbrood&quot; (very similar to the drop scone), and possibly other similarly named quick breads may have made their way onto the British tea table, where their similar names merged into one. 

Thus, The most widely accepted origin of &#x27;scone&#x27; is the Scots Gaelic term &quot;sgonn&quot;, meaning a large lump or mass, reflecting its original form as a rustic, hand-shaped bread. Other proposed etymologies, such as Middle Dutch &quot;schoonbrood&quot; (fine white bread), are less commonly supported in linguistic studies. The Middle Low German term &quot;schöne&quot;, meaning fine bread, may also have played a role in the origination of this word.

On the other hand, Sheila MacNiven Cameron derives the word from the town of Scone () (, ) in Scotland, the ancient capital where Scottish monarchs were crowned, and on whose Stone of Scone the monarchs of the United Kingdom are still crowned today.

== History ==

When baking powder became available to the masses, scones began to be the oven-baked, well-leavened items we know today.
The Yorkshire-based family bakery, Haywood &amp; Padgett, was the first bakery to launch their scones in supermarkets in the UK in the late 1980s.
 Modern scones are now widely available in British bakeries, grocery stores, and supermarkets. A 2005 market report estimated the UK scone market to be worth £64m, showing a 9% increase over the previous five years. The increase is partly due to an increasing consumer preference for impulse and convenience foods.

Scones sold commercially are usually round, although some brands are hexagonal, as this shape may be tessellated for space efficiency. When prepared at home, they may take various shapes, including triangles, rounds and squares. Baking scones at home is often closely tied to heritage baking. They tend to be made using family recipes rather than recipe books, since it is often a family member who holds the &quot;best&quot; and most-treasured recipe.

In 2023, a West London woman completed a decade-long project to sample a scone at every National Trust location (244 sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Scones became a staple of afternoon tea in the early 19th century, a tradition popularized by Anna, Duchess of Bedford, who introduced the practice of enjoying scones with tea as a light refreshment between meals.

== Varieties ==
British scones are often lightly sweetened, but may also be savoury. They frequently include raisins, currants, cheese or dates. In Scotland and Ulster, savoury varieties of scone include &quot;soda scones&quot;, also known as soda farls, sour dough scones known as &quot;soor dook scones&quot; made with sour milk, and potato scones, normally known as &quot;tattie scones&quot;, which resemble small, thin savoury pancakes made with potato flour. Potato scones are most commonly served fried in a full Scottish breakfast or an Ulster fry.

The griddle scone (or &quot;girdle scone&quot; in Scots) is a variety of scone that is cooked on a griddle on the stove top rather than baked in the oven. This usage is also common in New Zealand, where scones of all varieties form an important part of traditional colonial New Zealand cuisine.
Other common varieties include the &quot;dropped scone&quot;, or &quot;drop scone&quot;, like a pancake, after the method of dropping the batter onto the griddle or frying pan to cook it, and the &quot;lemonade scone&quot;, which is made with clear lemonade and cream instead of butter and milk. The fruit scone or fruited scone contains currants, sultanas, peel and glacé cherries mixed into the dough. To achieve lightness and flakiness, scones may be made with cream instead of milk.

In some countries one may also encounter savoury varieties of scone that may contain or be topped with combinations of cheese, onion, bacon, etc.

Scones can be presented with various toppings and condiments, typically butter, jam and cream. Strawberries are also sometimes used.

== Regional variations ==

=== Australia ===
Pumpkin scones, made by adding mashed cooked pumpkin to the dough mixture, had increased exposure during the period when Florence Bjelke-Petersen was in the public eye. Date scones, which contain chopped dried dates, can also be found in Australia. Another old style of cooking scones, generally in the colder months, is to deep-fry or deep pan-fry them in dripping or oil; prepared this way, they are called &quot;puftaloons&quot;.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, a pastry very similar to the British version exists under the name &quot;pogácsa&quot;. The name has been adopted by several neighbouring nations&#x27; languages. Pogácsa is almost always savoury and served with varied seasonings and toppings, like dill and cheese.

===Norway===
Norwegian scones may contain raisins and orange and lemon bits. Instead of using butter, like most scone recipes, Norwegian scones use cultured milk instead.

=== New Zealand ===
Scones make up a part of kiwiana, and are among the most popular recipes in the &quot;Edmonds Cookery Book,&quot; New Zealand&#x27;s best-selling cook book. The &quot;Edmonds&quot; recipe is unsweetened, using only flour, baking powder, salt, butter and milk. Other ingredients such as cheese, sultanas and dates can be added.

Cheese scones are a popular snack sold in cafes or tea shops, where they are commonly served toasted with butter.
=== Slovakia ===
There&#x27;s pastry called pagac in Slovakia, which is very similar to the scone. Most varieties are savoury, potato or cheese based.
=== South Africa ===

Scones are commonly served with clotted cream and jam; grated cheddar cheese is another popular accompaniment.

=== South America ===

Scones are quite popular in Argentina as well as Uruguay. They were brought there by Irish, English and Scottish immigrants and by Welsh immigrants in Patagonia (Britons are the third largest foreign community in Argentina). They are usually accompanied by tea, coffee or mate.

=== United States ===

Unlike British scones, which are lighter and traditionally served with clotted cream and jam, American scones contain more butter and sugar, making them richer and intended to be eaten on their own. They are usually triangular, and often contain fruit such as blueberries or sultanas, or such flavorings as pumpkin, cinnamon or chocolate chips. They may also be topped with icing. They are often eaten as they are (not topped with butter, jam or cream), along with coffee or tea, and often appear in US coffee houses. American biscuits are more similar to traditional British scones, but are usually savoury and served with savoury meals.

In Idaho and Utah, the bread products locally called &quot;scones&quot; are similar to Native American frybread or New Orleans beignets and are made from a sweet yeast dough, with buttermilk and baking powder or soda added, and they are fried rather than baked. They are customarily served with butter and either honey or maple syrup.

===Zimbabwe===

In Zimbabwe scones are popular and often eaten for breakfast with English tea, jam and clotted cream. Originally brought to the country during its period of British colonial rule, the scone is sometimes seen as symbolic of the country&#x27;s historic link to the UK that has become Zimbabweanified.

<doc id="279564" wikidata="Q161844" url="?curid=279564" title="Epipactis">
<text>Epipactis, or helleborine, is a genus of terrestrial orchids consisting of approximately 70 species. This genus is abbreviated as Epcts in horticultural trade.

==Description==
Their creeping, fleshy rhizomes grow offshoots, from which then emerge the 20–70 cm long stems during the next spring.

There are four to eight alternate, lanceolate leaves, that grow progressively shorter near the top. The margins are entire, the top is acute. Species with less chlorophyll have blue-purple leaves.

Their bilaterally symmetrical colorful flowers grow from a terminal raceme. The three sepals and the two lateral petals are ovate and acuminate. Their color can vary from greenish-white to violet and purple.

The lip is divided in a bowl-shaped hypochile, with the outer surface greenish-white and threaded with dark veins. The wavy, snow-white epichile is fan-shaped.

The ovary is inferior. It produces a dry capsule with countless minute seeds.

==Chemistry==
As is characteristic of all orchids, &quot;Epipactis&quot; spp. are dependent on a mycorrhizal symbiosis (see also Orchid mycorrhiza). This allows some species to have reduced leaves and need little chlorophyll. Violet helleborine (&quot;Epipactis viridiflora&quot;) can even do without chlorophyll. These forms can be recognized by their purple instead of violet flowers.

==Habitat==
The species occur in temperate and subtropical climates of America, Asia, and Europe. These orchids grow in open spaces in forests, in undergrowth, on calcareous soils and are often found in wet dune-slacks near the sea. The only original American species is the giant helleborine (&quot;Epipactis gigantea&quot;). One species from Europe, broad-leaved helleborine (&quot;Epipactis helleborine&quot;), is invasive in North America. Most species are protected.

Most of these hardy orchids grow in a wet environment, but there are exceptions. The marsh helleborine (&quot;Epipactis palustris&quot;) is the only European orchid able to survive in a flooded habitat. &quot;Epipactis gigantea&quot; is a species found in the American west, and into southern Canada, in wet areas and even streams. It can grow to a height of 1 m. However, &quot;Epipactis helleborine&quot; grows in more diverse habitats, from sheltered sandy beaches to open spaces in deciduous or coniferous forests, on roadsides, in meadows, and on moist soils. It is sometimes called the weed orchid.

During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms &quot;clots&quot; or &quot;clouts&quot;, hence the name. Clotted cream is an essential ingredient for cream tea.

Although its origin is uncertain, the cream is associated with dairy farms in South West England and in particular the counties of Devon and Cornwall. The largest commercial producer in the United Kingdom is Rodda&#x27;s at Scorrier, near Redruth, Cornwall, which can produce up to 25 tons of clotted cream a day.

In 1998, &quot;Cornish clotted cream&quot; was registered as a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) under European Union law. The designation can be used if the production follows certain requirements, from milk produced in Cornwall and the cream has a minimum fat content of 55%. Following Brexit, the PDO was also registered under UK law. It is recognised as a geographical indication in Georgia, Iceland, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, and Ukraine.

==Description==

Clotted cream has been described as having a &quot;nutty, cooked milk&quot; flavour, and a &quot;rich sweet flavour&quot; with a texture that is grainy, sometimes with oily globules on the crusted surface. It is a thick cream, with a very high fat content (a minimum of 55 percent, but an average of 64 percent). For comparison, the fat content of single cream is only 18 percent.

According to the UK Food Standards Agency, clotted cream provides per .

==History==

Originally made by farmers to reduce the amount of waste from their milk, clotted cream has become so deep-rooted in the culture of southwest Britain that it is embedded as part of the region&#x27;s tourist attractions. While there is no doubt of its strong and long association with Cornwall and Devon, it is not clear how ancient its origins are.

The &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot; follows traditional folklore by suggesting it may have been introduced to Cornwall by Phoenician traders in search of tin. It is similar to kaymak (or kajmak), a Near Eastern delicacy that is made throughout the Middle East, southeast Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, India, and Turkey. A similar clotted cream known as () is also made in Mongolia.

Contemporary ancient food experts, noting Strabo&#x27;s commentaries on Britain, have proposed that the early Britons would probably have clotted cream to preserve its freshness.

More recently, regional archaeologists have associated the stone &quot;fogou&quot; (dial. &#x27;fuggy-hole&#x27;), or souterrains, found across Atlantic Britain, France, and Ireland as a possible form of &quot;cold store&quot; for dairy production of milk, cream, and cheese in particular. Similar functions are ascribed to the linhay (or &#x27;linney&#x27;) stone-built form, often used as a dairy in later medieval longhouses in the same regions.

It has long been disputed whether clotted cream originated in Devon or Cornwall, and which county makes it best. There is evidence that the monks of Tavistock Abbey were making clotted cream in the early 14th century. After their abbey had been ransacked by Vikings in AD 997, the monks rebuilt it with the help of Ordulf, Earl of Devon. In a BBC report, local historians claimed local workers were drafted in to help with the repairs, and the monks rewarded them with bread, clotted cream, and strawberry preserves. The 1658 cookery book &quot;The Compleat Cook&quot; had a recipe for &quot;clouted cream&quot;.

In the 19th century it was regarded as better nourishment than &quot;raw&quot; cream because that cream was liable to go sour and be difficult to digest, causing illness. An article from 1853 calculates that creating clotted cream will produce 25 percent more cream than regular methods. In Devon, it was so common that in the mid-19th century it was used in the formative processes of butter, instead of churning cream or milk. The butter made in this way had a longer lifespan and was free from any negative flavours added by the churning.

It has long been the practice for local residents in southwest England, or those on holiday, to send small tins or tubs of clotted cream by post to friends and relations in other parts of the British Isles.

===Protected Designation of Origin===
In 1993, an application was made for the name &quot;Cornish clotted cream&quot; to have a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) in the European Union for cream produced by the traditional recipe in Cornwall. This was accepted in 1998. Cornish clotted cream must be made from milk produced in Cornwall and have a minimum butterfat content of 55 percent. The unique, slightly yellow Cornish clotted cream colour is due to the high carotene levels in the grass.

==Preparation==
Traditionally, clotted cream was created by straining fresh cow&#x27;s milk, letting it stand in a shallow pan in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream to rise to the surface, then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling. The clots that formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a &quot;reamer&quot; or &quot;raimer&quot;. By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, which produced far more clotted cream than the traditional method from the same amount of milk.

Today, there are two distinct methods for making clotted cream. The &quot;float cream method&quot; includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for up to an hour it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The &quot;scald cream method&quot; is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream, which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.

The largest manufacturer in the United Kingdom is Rodda&#x27;s, a family-owned business based in Scorrier, Cornwall. Founded in 1890, the company was producing over per year in 1985. In 2010 the managing director said that they might produce as little as a day in January, but up to a day as Christmas approached. In the early 1980s, Rodda&#x27;s signed deals with international airlines to serve small tubs of clotted cream with the in-flight desserts. The company considers the annual Wimbledon tennis championships one of their peak selling periods. As a by-product, for every of milk used, of skimmed milk is produced, which is then used in food manufacture.

One Devon manufacturer, Definitely Devon was purchased by Robert Wiseman Dairies in March 2006, closing one of the two Devon dairies and moving all production to Okehampton. However, in 2011 Robert Wiseman sold the Definitely Devon Brand to Rodda&#x27;s, who moved the production of Definitely Devon to Cornwall, which caused some controversy as the name was not changed, prompting an investigation by Trading Standards.

Throughout southwest England, clotted cream manufacture is a cottage industry, with many farms and dairies producing cream for sale in local outlets. Clotted cream is also produced in Somerset, Dorset, Herefordshire, Pembrokeshire, and the Isle of Wight.

When authentic clotted cream is not available, there are ways to create a substitute product, such as by mixing mascarpone with whipped cream, a little sugar, and vanilla extract.

==Uses==

===Cream tea===

Clotted cream is an essential part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists particularly in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional &quot;splits&quot;—with strawberry jam, along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top. In Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream. Cream teas, known as Devonshire teas, spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them. In 2010, Langage Farm in Devon started a campaign for &quot;Devon cream tea&quot; to have protected designation of origin similar to &quot;Cornish clotted cream&quot;. One variation on a cream tea is called &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; which consists of a round of bread topped with clotted cream and golden syrup, honey, or treacle.

===Confectionery===
Clotted cream can be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, especially clotted cream from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout southwest England in the production of ice cream and fudge.

===Savoury dishes===
Clotted cream is used in some savoury dishes, and can be incorporated into mashed potato, risotto or scrambled eggs.

===Historical===
Cabbage cream (which does not contain cabbage despite the name) was a delicacy in the mid-17th century: layers of clotted cream were interspersed with sugar and rosewater, creating a cabbage-like effect when served. It was a common accompaniment to junket, a milk-based dessert that went out of fashion in the mid-20th century.

==Literature and folklore==
Clotted cream was mentioned in &quot;The Shepheardes Calendar&quot;, a poem by Edmund Spenser in 1579:

&lt;poem&gt;Ne would she scorn the simple shepherd swain,
For she would call him often heam,
And give him curds and clouted cream.&lt;/poem&gt;

As with many Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He eventually fell in love with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. A witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream that the witch was unable to sour.

Clotted cream is also mentioned as one of the staple foods of the hobbits in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; books.

<text>AC Propulsion is a San Dimas, California, USA company founded in 1992 by Alan Cocconi, Wally Rippel, and Paul Carosa, that specializes in alternating current-based drivetrain systems for electric vehicles. It offers AC-induction traction motors. The company produces electric vehicle drive systems featuring high performance, high efficiency induction motors and integrated high power battery charging. Previously, they built an electric sports car, the tzero and the eBox, an electric conversion based on the Scion XB. They also develop prototype electric vehicles for OEM customers.

==History==
Founder Alan Cocconi designed and built the controller used in the original GM Impact, which later became the GM EV1. ACP introduced the first AC-100 in 1992 and the AC-150 150 kW (200 hp) integrated drive system in 1994. The AC-150 has been used in a variety of applications such as the BMW Mini E, Foton Midi taxi and a USPS LLV demo vehicle. AC Propulsion was a pioneer in Vehicle to grid or V2G systems, with their second generation AC-150 drivetrain offering a bidirectional grid power connection.

The company works with automobile manufacturers such as Changan Automobile.

==Vehicles using an AC Propulsion electric drivetrain==

*AC Propulsion tzero
*AC Propulsion eBox
*Volvo 3CC
*Venturi Fetish
*Courreges EXE
*Courreges ZOOOP (with lithium polymer batteries)
*Wrightspeed X1 (based on the Ariel Atom)
*Mini E
*Peraves E-Tracer
*Toyota RAV4 EV
*Tesla Roadster (2008)

==Connection with Tesla Motors==
Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning had both taken test drives in the lithium-ion battery powered revision of the AC Propulsion tzero before founding Tesla Motors. Martin Eberhard encouraged Tom Gage and Alan Cocconi to move their prototype tzero into production. When they declined, in favor of working on their electrified Scion xB called the eBox, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning incorporated Tesla Motors to pursue the idea of building an electric roadster in the spirit of the tzero. Elon Musk later test drove the tzero as well, and he also encouraged AC Propulsion to commercialize the vehicle. Tom Gage again deferred, but put Elon Musk in contact with Martin Eberhard which led to Musk becoming Tesla Motors&#x27; first major investor through Series A funding.

Before Tesla Motors developed its Roadster&#x27;s proprietary powertrain, the company licensed AC Propulsion&#x27;s EV Power System design and Reductive Charging patent which covers integration of the charging electronics with the inverter, thus reducing mass, complexity, and cost. Tesla then designed and built its own power electronics, motor, and other drivetrain components that incorporated this licensed technology from AC Propulsion. Given the extensive redevelopment of the vehicle, Tesla Motors no longer licenses any proprietary technology from AC Propulsion.

<text>Oneness Pentecostalism (also known as Apostolic, Jesus&#x27; Name Pentecostalism, or the Jesus Only movement) is a nontrinitarian religious movement within the Protestant Christian family of churches known as Pentecostalism. It derives its name from its teaching on the Godhead, a form of Modalistic Monarchianism commonly referred to as the Oneness doctrine. The doctrine states that there is one God―a singular divine spirit with no distinction of persons―who manifests himself in many ways, including as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This stands in sharp contrast to the mainstream doctrine of three distinct, eternal persons posited by Trinitarian theology.

Oneness Pentecostals differ from most other Pentecostals and Evangelicals in their views on soteriology, believing that true saving faith is demonstrated by repentance, full-submersion water baptism, and baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in other tongues. Oneness believers also solely baptize in the name of Jesus Christ, rejecting the Trinitarian formulas.

Many Oneness Pentecostal groups―especially the United Pentecostal Church International―tend to emphasize strict holiness standards in dress, grooming, and other areas of personal conduct. This teaching is shared with traditional Holiness Pentecostals, but not with other Finished Work Pentecostal groups―or at least not to the degree that is generally found in some Oneness Pentecostal (and Holiness Pentecostal) churches that say holiness is to be set apart to God.

The Oneness Pentecostal movement first emerged in North America around 1914 as the result of a schism following the doctrinal disputes within the nascent Finished Work Pentecostal movement (which itself had broken from Holiness Pentecostalism)—specifically within the Assemblies of God. The movement claims an estimated 30 million adherents worldwide. It was often referred to as the Jesus Only movement in its early days—referring to its baptismal formula—which may be misleading as it does not deny the existence of the Father or Holy Spirit.

==History==
The first Pentecostals were Holiness Pentecostals, teaching three works of grace: the new birth, receipt of entire sanctification, and baptism with the Holy Spirit accompanied by glossolalia. Finished Work Pentecostals broke away from the Holiness Pentecostals before further partitioning into Trinitarian and nontrinitarian branches, with the latter forming Oneness Pentecostalism. Finished Work Pentecostals rejected the Wesleyan doctrines of outward holiness and Christian perfection, which Holiness Pentecostals teach is an instantaneous, definitive second work of grace in which the baptized person&#x27;s soul is cleansed of its original sin and perfected. The Oneness Pentecostal movement began in 1913 as the result of doctrinal disputes within the nascent Pentecostal movement, specifically within the Assemblies of God, the first Finished Work Pentecostal denomination.

===Beginnings of the Oneness movement===

In April 1913, at the Apostolic Faith Worldwide Camp Meeting held in Arroyo Seco, California, conducted by Maria Woodworth-Etter, organizers promised that God would &quot;deal with them, giving them a unity and power that we have not yet known.&quot; Canadian R.E. McAlister preached a &quot;new revelation&quot; that a baptismal formula in &quot;the name of Jesus&quot; only was to be preferred over the three-part Trinitarian formula formula &quot;Father, Son, and Holy Ghost&quot; found in Matthew 28:19, pointing rather to Acts 2:38. The revelation immediately caused controversy, with Frank Denny, a Pentecostal missionary to China, jumping on the platform and trying to censor McAlister.

McAlister&#x27;s revelation inspired a young minister named John G. Schaepe. After all-night prayer and bible study, he proclaimed the following day that he had also received a revelation against Trinitarian baptism. His judgment was accepted by several others in the camp and given further theological development by a minister named Frank Ewart. On April 15, 1914, Ewart and Glenn Cook publicly baptized each other specifically in &quot;the name of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; in a tank set up in Ewart&#x27;s crusade tent. This is considered to be the historical point when Oneness Pentecostalism emerged as a distinct movement.

A number of ministers claimed they were baptized in Jesus&#x27; name before 1914, including Frank Small and Andrew D. Urshan. Urshan claimed to have baptized others in Jesus&#x27; name as early as 1910. In addition, Charles Parham was recorded baptizing using a similar formula during the Azusa Street revival; until 1914, both Parham and William J. Seymour baptized using this Christological formula but repudiated the new movement&#x27;s nontrinitarian teachings amidst the controversy as they baptized as Christocentric Trinitarians.

In the Assemblies of God, the re-baptisms in only Jesus&#x27; name caused a backlash from many Trinitarians. The issue finally came to a head in October 1916 at the Fourth General Council: the mostly Trinitarian leadership, fearing that the new movement might overtake their organization, drew up a doctrinal statement affirming the truth of Trinitarianism. When the resulting Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths was adopted, a third of the Assemblies&#x27; ministers left to form Oneness congregations. After this separation, most Oneness believers became relatively isolated from other Pentecostals and Nicene Christianity more broadly.

===Forming Oneness organizations===

Several small Oneness ministerial groups formed after 1914. Many of these ultimately merged into the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World (PAW), while others remained independent (e.g., the Apostolic Faith Mission Church of God). Divisions occurred within the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World over the role of women in ministry, usage of wine or grape juice in communion observance, divorce and remarriage, and the proper mode of water baptism. There were also reports of racial tension in the organization. Many African Americans were joining the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World and held significant leadership positions. In particular, the African American pastor G. T. Haywood served as the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World&#x27;s general secretary and signed all ministerial credentials. Three new organizations were formed in 1925: the Apostolic Churches of Jesus Christ, Emmanuel&#x27;s Church in Jesus Christ, and the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance. The former two later merged to become the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, and the latter became the Pentecostal Church, Inc.

In 1945, a merger of two predominantly-white Oneness groups—the Pentecostal Church, Inc. and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ—resulted in the formation of the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI). Starting with 521 member-churches, it became the largest and most influential Oneness Pentecostal organization, reporting a membership of over 5.75 million in 2024.

Oneness theology has also influenced independent Oneness Pentecostal movements that, while not officially affiliated with major denominations, embrace Jesus&#x27; name baptism and the infilling of the Holy Ghost as central to salvation.

==Oneness theology==
Oneness Pentecostalism has a historical precedent in the Modalistic Monarchianism of the fourth century. The early movement affirmed two central aspects of later Oneness belief:
#There is one indivisible God with no distinction of persons or components within God&#x27;s eternal essence.
#Jesus was the manifestation, human personification, and/or incarnation of the same singular God.

Oneness Pentecostals contend, based on Colossians 2:9, that the concept of God&#x27;s personhood is reserved for the immanent and incarnate presence of Jesus only.

===Characteristics of God===
Oneness theology maintains that God is a singular spirit who is absolutely and indivisibly unitary, not three persons, individuals, or minds. They contend that the terms &quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Son&quot;, and &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; (or &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;) are mere &quot;titles&quot; reflecting the different personal manifestations of God in the universe. To Oneness believers, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three manifestations of &quot;one&quot; personal God.

Oneness theologians often quote a phrase used by early pioneers of the movement: &quot;God was manifested as the Father in creation, the Son in redemption, and the Holy Ghost in emanation.&quot; However, Oneness theologian David Norris points out that this does not mean that Oneness Pentecostals believe that God can only be one of those manifestations at a time, which may be suggested by the quote.

According to Oneness theology, the Father and the Holy Spirit are the same personal God. It teaches that the term &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; is a descriptive title for God manifesting himself through the broader Christian Church. These two titles—as well as others—do not reflect divisible persons within the Godhead, but rather two different ways in which the one God reveals himself to his creatures. Thus, when the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) speaks of &quot;the Lord God and his Spirit&quot; in Isaiah 48:16, it does not indicate two distinct persons, according to Oneness theology. Instead, &quot;the Lord&quot; means God in all his glory and transcendence, while &quot;his Spirit&quot; refers to his Holy Spirit that moved upon and spoke to the Hebrew prophets. Oneness theologian David K. Bernard states that this passage does not imply two persons any more than the numerous scriptural references to a man and his spirit or soul (such as in Luke 12:19) imply two &quot;persons&quot; existing within one body.

Bernard asserts that it is unbiblical to describe God as a plurality of persons in any sense of the word, &quot;regardless of what persons meant in ancient church history.&quot;

===Son of God===
According to Oneness theology, the Son of God did not exist (in any substantial sense) before the incarnation of Jesus of Nazareth except as the &quot;logos&quot; (or word) of God. They believe that the humanity of Jesus did not exist before the Incarnation, but that Jesus pre-existed in his deity (not his humanity) as the eternal God. This belief is supported by the lack of Jesus&#x27; incarnate presence anywhere in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible). Thus, Oneness Pentecostals believe that the title &quot;Son&quot; only applied to the Christ when he became flesh on earth. The Father in this theology embodies the divine attributes of the Godhead, and the Son embodies the human aspects. Oneness Pentecostals believe that Jesus and the Father are one essential person, though operating in different modes.

Oneness author W. L. Vincent writes, &quot;The argument against the &#x27;Son being his own Father&#x27; is a red herring. It should be evident that Oneness theology acknowledges a clear distinction between the Father and Son–in fact this has never been disputed by any Christological view that I am aware of.&quot;

====The Word====
Oneness theology holds that &quot;the Word&quot; in John 1:1 was God&#x27;s mind or plan. Oneness Pentecostals believe that the Word was not a separate person from God but that it was the plan of God and God itself. Bernard writes in his book &quot;The Oneness View of Jesus Christ&quot;, 

Bernard additionally claims that the Greek word &quot;pros&quot; (translated as &quot;with&quot; in John 1:1) could also be translated as &quot;pertaining to&quot;, meaning that John 1:1 could also be translated as (in his view) &quot;The Word pertained to God and the Word was God.&quot;

In the incarnation, Oneness believers hold that God put the Word (which was his divine plan) into action by manifesting himself in the form of the man Jesus, and thus &quot;the Word became flesh&quot;. As an extension, Oneness Pentecostalism argues that the incarnation was a singular event unlike anything God has done prior or will ever do again. Oneness Pentecostals believe that the Word of John 1:1 does not imply a second pre-existent, divine person but that the Word is simply the plan of God, which was put into action through the incarnation.

====The dual nature of Christ====

When discussing the Incarnation, Oneness theologians and authors often refer to a concept known as the dual nature of Christ, which is understood as the union of human and divine natures in the man Jesus. Bernard describes this concept in his book &quot;The Oneness of God&quot;, stating that Jesus &quot;is both Spirit and flesh, God and man, Father and Son. On his human side, He is the Son of man; on his divine side, He is the Son of God and is the Father dwelling in the flesh.&quot; Oneness Pentecostals see this not as two persons in one body but instead as two natures united in one person: Jesus. Oneness believers see the mystery referred to in 1 Timothy 3:16 as referencing this concept of two natures being united in the one person of Jesus.

Although the Oneness belief in the union of the divine and human into one person in Jesus is similar to the Chalcedonian formula, Chalcedonians disagree sharply with them over their opposition to Trinitarian dogma. Chalcedonians see Jesus as a single person uniting God the Son—the eternal second person of the Trinity—with human nature. Oneness believers, on the other hand, see Jesus as one single person uniting the one God himself with human nature as the Son of God.

===Scripture===
Oneness Pentecostalism subscribes to the doctrine of &quot;sola scriptura&quot; in common with mainstream Pentecostals and other Protestants. They view the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and as absolutely inerrant in its contents (though not necessarily in every translation). They specifically reject the conclusions of church councils such as the First Council of Nicaea and the Nicene Creed. They believe that mainstream Christians have been misled by long-held and unchallenged &quot;traditions of men&quot;.

===The name of Jesus===
The overwhelming emphasis on the person of Jesus shapes the content of a theology based on experience among both Oneness and Trinitarian Pentecostals. In principle, the doctrinal emphasis on Jesus attributes all divine qualities and functions to the Christ. What might, therefore, be called a &#x27;Christological maximalism&#x27; in the Pentecostal doctrine of God among Oneness Pentecostals leads to a factual substitution of the three divine persons with the single person of Jesus. At the same time, Trinitarian Pentecostals typically elevate Jesus from the second person of the Trinity to the central figure of Christian faith and worship.

Critics of Oneness theology commonly refer to its adherents as &quot;Jesus Only&quot;, implying that they deny the existence of the Father and Holy Spirit. Most Oneness Pentecostals consider that term to be pejorative and a misrepresentation of their true beliefs on the issue. Oneness believers insist that while they do indeed believe in baptism only in the name of Jesus Christ, to describe them as &quot;Jesus Only Pentecostals&quot; implies a denial of the Father and Holy Spirit.

===View of the Trinity===
Oneness Pentecostals believe that the Trinitarian doctrine is a &quot;tradition of men&quot; and is neither scriptural nor a teaching of God, citing the absence of the word &quot;Trinity&quot; from the Bible as one evidence of this. They—alongside the nontrinitarian Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses—generally believe the doctrine was gradually developed over the first four centuries AD, culminating with the Council of Nicaea and later councils which made the doctrine as believed today orthodox. Most mainstream Christian scholars have rejected these assertions, and some have rebutted alleged misinterpretations of Trinitarians seeming to support those assertions.

Oneness Pentecostals insist that their conception of the Godhead is reflective of early Christianity&#x27;s allegedly strict monotheism, contrasting their views not only with Trinitarianism but equally with the theology espoused by the Latter-day Saints (who believe that Christ was a separate god from the Father and the Spirit) and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (who see him as the first-begotten Son of God, and as a subordinate deity to the Father). Oneness theology is similar to historical Modalism or Sabellianism, although it cannot be strictly characterized as such.

The Oneness position as nontrinitarians places them at odds with the members of most Christian denominations, some of whom have accused Oneness Pentecostals of being Modalists and derided them as cultists. Oneness clergy consecrated into the Joint College of Bishops are also at odds on the grounds of their claims to apostolic succession (being that documented consecrators in succession were Trinitarian from the Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Eastern churches, alongside contradicting records).

==== Accusations of Modalism and Arianism ====
Oneness believers are often accused of being Modalistic. They have also occasionally been accused of Arianism or Semi-Arianism, usually by isolated individuals rather than church organizations. While Bernard indicates that Modalistic Monarchianism and Oneness are essentially the same, and that Sabellius was basically correct (so long as one does not understand Modalism to be the same as patripassianism), and while Arius also believed that God is a singular person, Bernard vehemently denies any connection to Arianism or Subordinationism in Oneness teaching.

===Oneness views on the early church===
Scholars within the movement differ in their views on church history. Some church historians, such as Dr. Curtis Ward, Marvin Arnold, and William Chalfant, hold to a Successionist view, arguing that their movement has existed in every generation from the original day of Pentecost to the present day. Ward has proposed a theory of an unbroken Pentecostal church lineage, claiming to have chronologically traced its perpetuity throughout the church&#x27;s history.

Others hold to a Restorationist view, believing that while the apostles and their church clearly taught Oneness doctrine and the Pentecostal experience, the early apostolic church went into apostasy and ultimately evolved into the Roman Catholic Church. For them, the contemporary Oneness Pentecostal movement began in America in the early 20th century during the latter days of the Azusa Street Revival. Restorationists such as Bernard and Norris deny any direct link between the church of the Apostolic Age and the current Oneness movement, believing that modern Oneness Pentecostalism is a total restoration originating from a step-by-step separation within Protestantism culminating in the final restoration of the early apostolic church.

Both Successionists and Restorationists among Oneness Pentecostals assert that the early apostolic church believed in the Oneness and Jesus name baptism doctrines. Oneness theologian David K. Bernard claims to trace Oneness adherents back to the first converted Jews of the Apostolic Age. He asserts that there is no evidence of these converts having any difficulty comprehending the Christian Church&#x27;s teachings and integrating them with their existing Judaic beliefs; however, in the post-Apostolic Age, Bernard claims that Hermas, Clement of Rome, Polycarp, Polycrates, Ignatius (who lived between 90 and 140 AD), and Irenaeus (who died about 200 AD) were either Oneness, modalist, or at most a follower of an &quot;economic Trinity&quot;, that is, a temporary Trinity and not an eternal one. He also asserts that Trinitarianism&#x27;s origin was pagan, quoting anti-Catholic Alexander Hislop, a Presbyterian minister; but none of Hislop&#x27;s arguments have been confirmed by historians in contemporary scholarship.

Bernard theorizes that the majority of all believers were Oneness adherents until the time of Tertullian, whom he and many mainstream Christian scholars believe was the first prominent exponent of Trinitarianism (though Theophilus of Antioch was the first to use the term). In support of his allegation, Bernard quotes Tertullian as writing against Praxeas:
 In contrast to Bernard&#x27;s theory, mainstream Christian scholars suggest the writings of Ignatius and Irenaeus teach an eternal Trinity, though Norris disagrees with them in his book &quot;I AM: A Oneness Pentecostal Theology&quot;, writing, &quot;While Ignatius can on occasion utilize the language of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, he does not have three persons in mind.&quot;

==Oneness soteriology==
In common with most Protestant denominations, Oneness Pentecostal soteriology maintains that all people are born with a sinful nature, sin at a young age, and remain lost without hope of salvation unless they embrace the Gospel that Jesus made complete atonement for the sins of all people, which is the sole means of human redemption; and that salvation comes solely by grace through faith in Jesus. Oneness doctrine also teaches that true faith results in obedience, and that salvation is not only to profess faith but to demonstrate it as well in action. Oneness churches, while exhibiting variations, generally teach the following as the foundation of Christian conversion:
* repentance;
* water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ;
* baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues.

Oneness Pentecostals generally accept that these are the minimal requirements of conversion.

===Grace and faith===
Oneness Pentecostals maintain that no good works or obedience to the law can save anyone apart from God&#x27;s grace. Furthermore, salvation comes solely through faith in Jesus; there is no salvation through any name or work other than his (Acts 4:12). Oneness teaching rejects interpretations that hold that salvation is given automatically to the elect; they believe that all humans are called to salvation, and &quot;whosoever will, may come&quot; (Revelation 22:17).

While salvation is indeed a gift in Oneness belief, it must be &quot;received&quot;. This reception of salvation is generally considered conversion and is accepted in most evangelical Protestant churches. The first mandate is true faith in Jesus, demonstrated by obedience to God&#x27;s commands and a determination to submit to his will in every aspect of life. Oneness adherents reject the notion that one may be saved through what they call &quot;mental faith&quot;: mere belief in Jesus without life-changing repentance or obedience. Thus, they emphatically reject the idea that one is saved through praying the Sinner&#x27;s prayer, but rather the true saving faith and change of life declared in scripture. Oneness Pentecostals have no issue with the prayer itself but deny that it alone represents saving faith, believing the Bible accordingly mandates repentance, baptism by water and spirit with receipt of the Holy Spirit as a &quot;manifestation&quot; of the spirit part of the rebirth experience and the actual, godly faith obeyed and done by the early Church&#x27;s believers. Thus, one who has truly been saved will gladly submit to the biblical conditions for conversion. According to these believers, Jesus and the apostles taught that the new birth experience includes repentance and baptism in both water and God&#x27;s Spirit.

===Repentance===
Oneness Pentecostals maintain that salvation is not possible without repentance. While repentance is, in part, godly sorrow for sin, it is as much a complete change of heart and mind toward God and his word. This is why Oneness churches expect a complete reformation of life in those who have become Christians.

===Water baptism===
Oneness Pentecostals believe that water baptism is an essential component of salvation, not merely a symbolic act. They cite Acts 2:38, where Peter says to &quot;be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins&quot; as evidence that baptism is necessary for the forgiveness of sins. They also appeal to passages such as Mark 16:16 (&quot;He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved&quot;) and John 3:5, where Jesus states, &quot;Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,&quot; interpreting &quot;born of water&quot; as a direct reference to baptism. Oneness Pentecostals reject the idea that baptism is a mere public declaration of faith, arguing that it plays an active role in salvation by uniting believers with Christ and applying his atoning blood. They cite Romans 6:3-4, which states that believers are &quot;baptized into Christ&quot; and &quot;buried with him by baptism into death,&quot; as evidence that baptism is the moment when one is spiritually united with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection. Similarly, they reference 1 Peter 3:21, which states that &quot;baptism doth also now save us,&quot; reinforcing their belief that baptism is not optional but an integral part of the salvation process. Oneness Pentecostals also insist that baptism must be preceded by faith and repentance, rejecting infant baptism and baptisms performed by compulsion.

This doctrinal emphasis on baptism as a salvific act is one of the key distinctions between Oneness Pentecostals and many other Protestant groups, which often view baptism as an outward testimony of an already completed salvation rather than an essential step in the process of being saved. 

====Baptismal mode====
Oneness Pentecostal theology maintains the literal definition of baptism as being completely immersed in water. They believe that other modes have no biblical basis or are based upon inexact Old Testament rituals and that their mode is the only one described in the New Testament. The Articles of Faith of the UPCI state that &quot;the scriptural mode of baptism is immersion and is only for those who have fully repented.&quot;

====Baptismal formula====

Oneness adherents believe that for water baptism to be valid, one must be baptized &quot;in the name of Jesus Christ&quot;, rather than the Trinitarian baptismal formula &quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&quot; This is referred to as the &quot;Jesus&#x27; name doctrine&quot;. &quot;Jesus&#x27; name&quot; is a description used to refer to Oneness Pentecostals and their baptismal beliefs.

Oneness Pentecostals mainly center their belief around the baptismal formula found in Acts 2:38: &quot;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&quot; Other passages cited include:
* Acts 8:16 – Samaritans were baptized &quot;in the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; 
* Acts 10:48 – Cornelius and his household were commanded to be baptized &quot;in the name of the Lord.&quot; 
* Acts 19:5 – Disciples of John the Baptist were re-baptized &quot;in the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; 
* Acts 22:16 – Paul was baptized &quot;calling on the name of the Lord&quot;

Oneness Pentecostals assert that these five mentions of baptism in the Book of Acts were performed in the name of Jesus and that no Trinitarian formula is ever referred to therein. In addition, is taken by Oneness Pentecostals to indicate baptism in Jesus&#x27; name as well; Oneness author William Arnold III explains their reasoning: &quot;If we follow Paul&#x27;s train of thought, his obvious implication is &#x27;No, Christ was the one crucified for you and so you were baptized in the name of Christ.&#x27; So the believers at Corinth as well as those in Rome were baptized in Jesus&#x27; name.&quot; Hence, Oneness believers claim that this constitutes proof that the Jesus&#x27; name formula was the original one and that the Trinitarian invocation was erroneously substituted for it later. As additional support for their claim, Oneness Pentecostals also cite editions of Britannica, the Catholic Encyclopedia, Interpreter&#x27;s Bible, and various scholars to justify this claim; Norris teaches that &quot;there is a strong scholarly consensus that the earliest Christian baptism was practiced in Jesus&#x27; name.&quot;

In contrast, the &quot;Didache&quot;—a Jewish Christian text generally dated to the first century AD—cites the Trinitarian formula. In response, some Oneness Pentecostals deride the text and support the now less common assertion of it being a second-century text; they also consider it untrustworthy, citing one manuscript existing (though a Latin manuscript was discovered in 1900).

Mainstream Trinitarian Christians exegete &quot;in the name of Jesus Christ&quot; as by the &quot;authority of Jesus,&quot; which denotes baptism in the name of the three persons of the Trinity. In response, Oneness Pentecostals have claimed that the wording of Acts 22:16 requires an oral invocation of the name of Jesus during baptism (&quot;calling&quot; on the name of the Lord). They also assert that the way one exercises the authority of Jesus is by using his name, pointing to the healing of the lame man at the Gate Beautiful in Acts 3 as an example of this.

====View of Matthew 28:19====
Oneness Pentecostals insist that there are no New Testament references to baptism by any other formula—save in Matthew 28:19, which most hold to be another reference to baptism in the name of Jesus. Although Matthew 28:19 seems to mandate a Trinitarian formula for baptism, Oneness theology avows that since the word &quot;name&quot; in the verse is &quot;singular&quot;, it must refer to Jesus, whose name they believe to be that of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Oneness believers insist that all Bible&#x27;s texts on the subject must be in complete agreement with each other; thus, they say that either the apostles disobeyed the command they had been given in Matthew 28:19 or they correctly fulfilled it by using the name of Jesus.

Some Oneness believers consider that the text of Matthew 28:19 is not original, quoting various scholars and the early Church historian Eusebius, who referred to this passage at least eighteen times in his works. Eusebius&#x27; text reads: &quot;go and make disciples of all nations in my name, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you.&quot; However, most Oneness believers accept the full Matthew 28:19 as an authentic part of the original text.

===Baptism of the Holy Spirit===
Oneness Pentecostals believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a free gift commanded for all. They believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is an essential component of salvation, asserting that receiving the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues directly fulfills the New Testament mandate. This distinguishes their theology from classical Trinitarian Pentecostalism: while Oneness and Trinitarian Pentecostals emphasize the importance of Spirit baptism, they diverge on its role in salvation. Trinitarian Pentecostals, such as those in the Assemblies of God, teach that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a subsequent experience meant for empowerment, not necessarily required for salvation. In contrast, Oneness Pentecostals maintain that one must be baptized in the Holy Spirit with the initial sign of speaking in tongues to be truly born again. Oneness Pentecostals cite biblical passages such as John 3:5 (&quot;Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&quot;) and Romans 8:9 (&quot;Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his&quot;) to support their belief that Spirit baptism is a requirement for salvation.

Pentecostals—both Oneness and Trinitarian—maintain that the Holy Spirit experience denotes the genuine Christian Church and empowers the believer to accomplish God&#x27;s will. Like most Pentecostals, Oneness believers maintain that the initial sign of the infilling Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues and that the New Testament mandates this as a minimal requirement. They equally recognize that speaking in tongues is a sign to unbelievers of the Holy Spirit&#x27;s power and is to be actively sought after and utilized, especially in prayer. However, this initial manifestation of the Holy Spirit () is seen as distinct from the gift of divers kinds of tongues mentioned in , which is given to selected spirit-filled believers as the Holy Spirit desires. Oneness adherents assert that receipt of the Holy Spirit (manifested by speaking in tongues) is necessary for salvation.

==Practices==

===Worship===
In common with other Pentecostals, Oneness believers are known for their charismatic style of worship. Oneness Pentecostal worship is characterized by expressive congregational participation, including verbal praises, prayers, singing accompanied by musical instruments, and energetic preaching. They believe that the spiritual gifts found in the New Testament are still active in the church; hence, services are often spontaneous, being punctuated at times with acts of speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, prophetic messages, and the laying on of hands for the purposes of healing. Oneness believers, like all Pentecostals, are characterized by their practice of speaking in other tongues. In such ecstatic experiences a Oneness believer may vocalize fluent unintelligible utterances (glossolalia), or articulate a natural language previously unknown to them (xenoglossy).

Some Oneness Pentecostals practice foot washing, often in conjunction with their celebration of communion, as Jesus Christ did with his disciples at the Last Supper.

===Holiness standards===
Many Oneness Pentecostal groups emphasize holiness standards in dress, grooming, and conduct. This is a teaching similar to traditional Holiness Pentecostals but distinct from other Finished Work Pentecostals.

====Historical development====

The doctrine of outward holiness originated in Methodism. The early Methodists wore plain dress, with Methodist clergy condemning &quot;high headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and &#x27;costly apparel&#x27; in general&quot;. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, recommended that Methodists read his thoughts &quot;On Dress&quot;, in which he detailed acceptable types and colors of fabrics, in addition to &quot;shapes and sizes of hats, coats, sleeves, and hairstyles&quot;. In that sermon, John Wesley expressed his desire for Methodists: &quot;Let me see, before I die, a Methodist congregation, full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation.&quot; He also taught, with respect to Christian headcovering, that women, &quot;especially in a religious assembly&quot;, should &quot;keep on her veil&quot;.

This Methodist doctrine continues to be taught (in varying degrees) in conservative Methodist denominations aligned with the holiness movement, such as the Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches and the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection. The 1858 Wesleyan Methodist Book of Discipline stated,

The teaching of Methodists aligned with that the holiness movement, where outward holiness is a testimony of a Christian believer&#x27;s regeneration, done in obedience to God. This teaching was inherited by Holiness Pentecostalism at its inception, incorporating this Wesleyan theology alongside Holiness Pentecostal&#x27;s insistence on a third work of grace.

Though Oneness Pentecostals emerged from the Finished Work Pentecostalism movement that rejected the Wesleyan and Holiness Pentecostal doctrine of entire sanctification as an instantaneous, definite second work of grace, Oneness Pentecostals did retain the original Holiness Pentecostal practice of holiness standards.

====Oneness teachings====
Oneness Pentecostals believe that a Christian&#x27;s lifestyle should be characterized by holiness. In their view, this holiness begins at baptism, when the blood of Christ washes away all sin and a person stands before God truly holy for the first time in his or her life. After this, a separation from the world in both practical and moral areas is essential to spiritual life. Moral or inward holiness consists of righteous living, guided and powered by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Practical or outward holiness for many Oneness believers involves certain holiness standards that dictate, among other things, modest apparel and gender distinction.

Oneness Pentecostals believe wholeheartedly in dressing modestly. They believe there is a distinct deference to God&#x27;s commands in living modestly (shunning indecency) and in moderation (avoiding excesses and extremes). They justify this belief by using 1 Timothy 2:9 (&quot;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel&quot;) and Philippians 4:5 (&quot;Let your moderation be known unto all men&quot;). Some Oneness organizations, considering current social trends in fashion and dress to be immoral, have established dress codes for their members. These guidelines are similar to those used by all Pentecostal denominations for much of the first half of the 20th century. According to UPCI standards, women are generally expected not to wear pants, make-up, form fitting clothing, jewelry, or to cut their hair; while men are expected to be clean-shaven, short-haired, and are expected to wear long sleeve shirts (women are also expected to wear long sleeve dresses or blouses) and long-legged pants, as opposed to shorts. Additionally, some Oneness organizations strongly admonish their members not to watch secular movies or television. However, the precise degree to which these standards are enforced varies from church to church and even from individual to individual within the movement.

Due to the comparative strictness of their standards, Oneness Pentecostals are often accused of legalism by some Christians. Oneness denominations respond by saying that holiness is commanded by God and that it &quot;follows&quot; salvation, rather than causes it. They say holiness proceeds from love rather than duty and is motivated by the holy nature imparted by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. While the Christian life is indeed one of liberty from rules and laws, that liberty does not negate one&#x27;s responsibility to follow scriptural teachings on moral issues, many of which were established by Jesus and the apostles themselves.

<doc id="279584" wikidata="Q8047970" url="?curid=279584" title="Korean Empire won">
<text>The Korean won ( , ) or Korean Empire won (), was the official currency of the Korean Empire between 1900 and 1910. It was subdivided into 100 &quot;jeon&quot; ( ; , ).

== Etymology ==
Won is a cognate of the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, which were both derived from the Spanish-American silver dollar. It is derived from the hanja (, &quot;won&quot;), meaning &quot;round&quot;, which describes the shape of the silver dollar.

== History ==
The Korean won, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen were all derived from the Spanish-American silver dollar, a coin widely used for international trade between Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries.

On May 22, 1901 the Korean Empire adopted the gold standard in response to many other countries doing the same. The won was introduced in 1902, replacing the yang at a rate of 1 won = 10 yang. Units: 1 won = 100 jeon (錢), 1 jeon = 5 bun (分, &quot;fun&quot; ec. yesteryear spellings) of the preceding currency. Gold coins were produced in the denominations of 5, 10, and 20 won. All of these coins had a composition of 90% gold and 10% copper. Another notable feature of these coins is that they, unlike the earlier yang coinage, contained no English inscriptions as they only contained Chinese and Hangul legends.

As a part of the Russian influence in Korea at the time, the Koreans introduced a small number of &quot;Russified&quot; coins between the years 1901 and 1902, but these coins would prove to be unsuccessful as they were swept away by the flood of cupronickel coins.

The disagreements between the Japanese and Russian Empires led to the Russo-Japanese War when Japan attacked Port Arthur in Russian Dalian and Incheon in Korea, the war ended in a Japanese victory, Japan occupied the Kwantung Leased Territory and the Korean peninsula. The Japanese immediately took control over Korean financial matters. On October 16, 1904 the Koreans accepted Baron Megata Tanetarō from the Japanese Ministry of Finance as financial adviser to their government, Megata was assigned to assume complete jurisdiction over Korea&#x27;s finances. When Megata arrived in Korea, he told Sir John Newell Jordan, the British Minister-Resident in Korea at the time, that the Japanese protectorate over Korea was being modeled on British rule in Egypt. One of the first recommendations by Baron Megata was to close all Korean Mints and commence a reform of the Korean currency. One of the primary policies he proposed was removing the cupronickel coins from circulation. 

After the Japanese had pressured the Korean Mint Bureau, which had been striking coins for 20 years, to close in November of the year 1904, all gold coins of the won were produced at the Japan Mint in Osaka (日本大阪造幣局). In 1905 the Japan Mint began to produce the Korean won&#x27;s new coinage, this entirely new series was modeled almost exactly on the patterns of contemporary Japanese coins and even used the same planchets.

As the coins of the Korean won were being struck on the same planchets as the Japanese yen, when the Japanese would reduce the weight of the minor coinages of the yen in 1906, the weights and sizes of Korean coins were also reduced in 1907. This was also because the Japanese and Korean coins were circulating as equivalents to each other in exchange at the time.

In the year 1907 the imperial Korean government had designated the Japanese Dai-Ichi Bank to carry out the monetary reforms that were suggested by the Japanese adviser to Korea Baron Megata Tanetarō. The Dai-Ichi Bank attempted to withdraw the cupronickel coinage, recall the &quot;yeopjeon&quot;, and help circulate the newly introduced coinage that was minted in Osaka. During this era Korean cash coins were still largely circulating in the regions of southern and north-eastern Korea. The task of withdrawing the cupronickel coinage from circulation proved to not be an easy one because of the substantial number of counterfeit cupronickel coins that were circulating in Korea at the time, these counterfeit coins were redeemed by the Dai-Ichi Bank at reduced rates from the &quot;official&quot; cupronickel coins; during the exchange process, it was assumed by everybody that theirs cupronickel were &quot;official&quot; cupronickel coins and demanded the maximum exchange rate. The withdrawal of copper-alloy Korean cash coins was made easier due to a global rise in the price of copper, during this era thousands of pounds of copper-alloy Korean cash coins were exported at a profit.

In the year 1908, Korea was hit by a panic when the value of nickel dropped significantly, this led to the Korean public quickly exchanging their cupronickel at the banks. A staggering amount of 266.480,000 of cupronickel coins were exchanged during this panic. This panic would lead to the demonetisation of the Korean cupronickel coinage in November 1908. In the year 1909 there were supposedly 4,000,000 of 5 jeon nickel coins that were struck at the Japan Mint, however, most were melted down due to their demonetised status. Copper coins during this period were not affected by the panic exchange. Older coins collected by the banks from July 1905 to October 1907 resulted to be more than 375 tonnes. If it assumed that only cupronickel 5 fun coins of 7 grams were collected by the banks, more than 53,000,000 would have been collected from general circulation.

After 1908, circulation of the old cupronickel coins was outlawed by the imperial Korean government, while the cast copper-alloy cash coins remained to be legal tender in Korea at a value of 0.2 jeon, which meant that they had a nominal value of won.

Prince Hirobumi Ito pointed out to the Korean government the anomalous situation of having a foreign (Japanese) commercial bank as the central bank of their government and recommended that the Koreans create their own central bank in the same way that others nations had, and so in 1909, the Bank of Korea () was founded in Seoul as a central bank and began issuing currency of a modern type. And on 10 November 1909 many of the functions of the Dai-Ichi Bank were passed onto the newly established Bank of Korea.

The Bank of Korea assumed responsibility for the banknotes issued by the Dai-Ichi Bank that were still in circulation (which totalled 12,000,000 yen), the Dai-Ichi Bank would further transfer to the Bank of Korea the 4,000,000 yen in specie reserves which backed its banknotes. The balance was converted by the Bank of Korea to an interest-free 20-year loan to the Dai-Ichi Bank.

In the year 1910 the Japanese had formally annexed Korea, this meant that Korea&#x27;s native currency system would become an arm of the Japanese currency system. As a part of the reforms of Korea during the colonial period Korean coinage was suspended; Japanese coinage was then introduced to the peninsula to replace it, although the Japanese created no &quot;crash&quot; program of recall, nine years later in 1919 as much as 25% of all Korean won coins remained in circulation as only 75% of the Korean coinage had been withdrawn by the Japanese.

The won was equivalent to the Japanese yen and was replaced by the Korean yen in 1910 during the Colonial Era. In 1911, the Bank of Korea was renamed the Bank of Chōsen (; 朝鮮銀行), which issued notes denominated in yen and &quot;sen&quot;.

== Coins ==
Coins were minted in the denominations of , 1, 5, 10 and 20 jeon, , 5, 10 and 20 won. The coins all carried the title of the &quot;state&quot;, Daehan (), and the Korean era name, Gwangmu () and then Yunghui (), whilst the specifications were equivalent to the coins of the Japanese yen.

In 1906 Korea&#x27;s first gold coinage was created, in denominations of 5 won, 10 won, and 20 won. These coins were also of identical weight and fineness to their Japanese counterparts, but used a dragon which was similar to the previous generation of Japanese yen gold coins in their designs.

The dragon symbol was replaced by the phoenix on the jeon, 1 jeon, and 5 jeon coins when these coins started being produced by the Japan Mint.

List of coins of the Korean won:

=== Rare coins ===

* There is some question as to whether or not any jeon coins were minted in the year Gwangmu 11.
* The jeon coins minted in the years 1907 (隆熙元年) and 1910 (隆熙四年) are known to be very scarce.
* In September 2011 a 5 jeon coin from 1909 was at auction for $138,000.
* The 5 won gold coins are dated to have been produced in the years 1908 (隆熙二年) and 1909 (隆熙三年). Only two known pieces of the 1909 version of the 5 won are known to be extent, one of these pieces was sold at an auction for $460,000 in September 2011.
* The 10 won gold coins are dated to have been produced in the years 1906 (光武十年) and 1909 (隆熙三年). Only two known pieces of the 1909 version of the coin are known to be extent with one specimen of this series being sold at an auction for $299,000 in September 2011.
* The 20 won gold coins are dated to have been produced in the years 1906 (光武十年), 1908 (隆熙二年), and 1909 (隆熙三年). Only two specimens of the 1909 coin are known to be extent with one specimen of this series being sold at an auction for $632,500 in September 2011.

== Banknotes ==
No banknotes were issued denominated in won. However, Korean yen notes were issued by Dai-Ichi Ginko (First National Bank (of Japan), 주식회사제일은행, 株式會社第一銀行). The Dai-Ichi Bank&#x27;s role as treasury bank for the imperial Korean government, its responsibility for recalling the old cupronickel and Korean cash coinage, and the fact that this bank issued the only banknotes that ever gained universal acceptance in Korea at the time emphasised the fact that the Dai-Ichi Bank held a status of being the &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;Central Bank of Korea&quot; until the founding of the Bank of Korea.

Both local banks and quasi-governmental firms had tried to establish a paper money system in Korea during this era, but none of their issues seemed to have been readily accepted by the public. The Dai-Ichi Bank had petitioned the imperial Japanese government to be granted permission to issue banknotes in Korea, to augment the demonetised Japanese yen coins that it was importing, this was because in the year 1885 the imperial government had monopolised the issuing of banknotes and prohibited banks from doing this in Japan.

After the imperial Japanese government has granted this permission, the Dai-Ichi Bank released banknotes in the year 1902 that were printed by the Japanese Finance Ministry Printing Bureau. In Southern Korea they were well received in the trade port cities, but faced rejection in the Russian influenced cities of Seoul and Incheon. This was because of the ongoing rivalry between Japan and Russia. In the year 1902 the Russians successfully petitioned the Korean government to ban all banknotes issued by the Dai-Ichi Bank, but this ban only lasted for a few months.

The Dai-Ichi Bank had enough fiscal and economic strength to redeem every banknote that was presented to them when they were banned from circulating, later the Dai-Ichi Bank was able to withstand yet another run on its banknotes, this meant that public confidence in the issues of the Dai-Ichi Bank grew in Korea which helped the bank succeed.

In the year 1905 the Dai-Ichi Bank had been designated the &quot;treasury bank&quot; for the Korean government, which meant that it served as the Korean government&#x27;s agent for depositories and disbursing finances.

The Dai-Ichi Bank would issue fractional denomination banknotes (banknotes with denominations smaller than 1 yen) for the Imperial Japanese Army soldiers that were operating in northern Korea and Manchuria. Since these banknotes were printed by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, they were almost identical to the banknotes issued by the imperial Japanese government themselves for these same soldiers. The fractional banknotes issued by the Dai-Ichi Bank were seen as being very convenient, and were soon circulating all over the Korean peninsula.

Following the establishment of the Bank of Korea, it would immediately begin to issue its own banknotes, these new banknotes were redeemable &quot;in gold or Nippon Ginko notes.&quot; Most of the reserves held by the Bank of Korea at the time were banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan and commercial paper.

== Korean &quot;Eagle&quot; coins ==

Following the Japanese victory during the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing dynasty&#x27;s influence over the Korean peninsula was replaced by that of the Japanese Empire. Furthermore China&#x27;s weakened position during this era allowed for the interests of the Russian Empire in the Far East to expand significantly as well. The Russian Empire sent Mr. Alexiev as the financial advisor to Korea. On March 1, 1898 the first branch of the Russo-Korean Bank in Asia was established. In the year 1901, Alexiev authorised the minting of a new set of three coins, these were Korean &quot;Eagle&quot; coins were issued by the Russo-Korean Bank.

These coins are known as the Korean &quot;Eagle&quot; coins because the fact that instead of having a Korean dragon or Korean phoenix in their design they have a crowned eagle based on the coat of arms of Russia. All of the Korean &quot;Eagle&quot; coins were minted at the Yongsan Mint (龍山典局). These coins would prove to be unsuccessful as they were swept away by the flood of cupronickel coins.

The Russo-Korean bank also created a set of experimental coins (or &quot;trial coins&quot;) that were produced but never saw any circulation. This unissued coin series included a copper 10 won (十圜), a copper 20 won (二十圜), and a silver &quot;half dollar&quot; (半圜, &quot;half won&quot;). While all of these unissued Korean &quot;Eagle&quot; coins were reportedly minted in the year 1901, the coins display various other dates such as 1899, 1901, 1902, or 1903.

Following the Japanese victory during the Russo-Japanese War and Korea becoming a Japanese protectorate under the Eulsa Treaty, the Japanese would confiscate and destroy almost all Korean &quot;Eagle&quot; coins. Because of this, surviving Korean &quot;Eagle&quot; coins are extremely rare.

<doc id="279585" wikidata="Q709277" url="?curid=279585" title="Uptime">
<text>Uptime is a measure of system reliability, expressed as the period of time a machine, typically a computer, has been continuously working and available. Uptime is the opposite of downtime.

It is often used as a measure of computer operating system reliability or stability, in that this time represents the time a computer can be left unattended without crashing or needing to be rebooted for administrative or maintenance purposes.
Conversely, long uptime may indicate negligence, because some critical updates can require reboots on some platforms.

==Records==
In 2005, Novell reported a server with a 6-year uptime. Although that might sound unusual, that is actually common when servers are maintained under an industrial context and host critical applications such as banking systems.

Netcraft maintains the uptime records for many thousands of web hosting computers.

A server running Novell NetWare has been reported to have been shut down after 16 years of uptime due to a failing hard disk.

A Cisco router had been reported to have been running continuously for 21 years as of 2018. As of April 11, 2023, the uptime had increased to 26 years, 25 weeks, 1 day, 1 hour, and 8 minutes until the router was later decommissioned and the final report of the uptime was 26 years, 28 weeks, 2 days, and 6 minutes.

==Determining system uptime==

===Microsoft Windows===

====Windows Task Manager====

Some versions of Microsoft Windows include an uptime field in Windows Task Manager, under the &quot;Performance&quot; tab. The format is D:HH:MM:SS (days, hours, minutes, seconds).

====systeminfo====
The output of the codice_1 command includes a &quot;System Up Time&quot; or &quot;System Boot Time&quot; field.
C:\&gt;systeminfo | findstr &quot;Time:&quot;
System Up Time: 0 days, 8 hours, 7 minutes, 19 seconds
The exact text and format are dependent on the language and locale. The time given by codice_2 is not reliable. It does not take into account time spent in sleep or hibernation. Thus, the boot time will drift forward every time the computer sleeps or hibernates.

====NET command====
The codice_3 command with its codice_4 sub-command provides the date and time the computer started, for both the codice_5 and codice_6 variants. The command codice_7 is shorthand for codice_6. The exact text and date format is dependent on the configured language and locale.
C:\&gt;NET STATISTICS WORKSTATION | findstr &quot;since&quot;
Statistics since 8/31/2009 8:52:29 PM
====Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)====
Uptime can be determined via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), by querying the codice_9 property of the codice_10 class. At the command prompt, this can be done using the codice_11 command:
C:\&gt;wmic os get lastbootuptime
LastBootUpTime
20110508161751.822066+060
The timestamp uses the format codice_12, so in the above example, the computer last booted up on 8 May 2011 at 16:17:51.822. The text &quot;LastBootUpTime&quot; and the timestamp format do not vary with language or locale. WMI can also be queried using a variety of application programming interfaces, including VBScript or PowerShell.

====Uptime.exe====
Microsoft formerly provided a downloadable utility called codice_13, which reports elapsed time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
C:\&gt;Uptime
SYSTEMNAME has been up for: 2 day(s), 4 hour(s), 24 minute(s), 47 second(s)
The time given by codice_13 is not reliable. It does not take into account time spent in sleep or hibernation. Thus, the boot time will drift forward every time the computer sleeps or hibernates.

===FreeDOS===
The codice_15 command is also available for FreeDOS. The version was developed by M. Aitchison.

=== Linux ===

====Using uptime====
Users of Linux systems can use the BSD uptime utility, which also displays the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals:
$ uptime
 18:17:07 up 68 days, 3:57, 6 users, load average: 0.16, 0.07, 0.06
====Using /proc/uptime====
Shows how long the system has been on since it was last restarted:
$ cat /proc/uptime
 350735.47 234388.90
The first number is the total number of seconds the system has been up. The second number is how much of that time the machine has spent idle, in seconds. On multi-core systems (and some Linux versions) the second number is the sum of the idle time accumulated by each CPU.

===BSD===

====Using uptime====
BSD-based operating systems such as FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and SySVr4 have the &quot;uptime&quot; command (See ).

$ uptime
3:01AM up 69 days, 7:53, 0 users, load averages: 0.08, 0.07, 0.05
The uptime program on BSD is a hard link to the w program. The w program is based on the RSTS/E, TOPS-10, and TOPS-20 SYSTAT program.

====Using sysctl====
There is also a method of using &quot;sysctl&quot; to call the system&#x27;s last boot time:
$ sysctl kern.boottime
kern.boottime: { sec = 1271934886, usec = 667779 } Thu Apr 22 12:14:46 2010
===OpenVMS===
On OpenVMS systems, the codice_16 command can be used at the DCL command prompt to obtain the system uptime. The first line of the resulting display includes the system&#x27;s uptime, displayed as days followed by hours:minutes:seconds. In the following example, the command qualifier codice_17 suppresses the display of per-process detail lines of information.
$ show system/noprocess
OpenVMS V7.3-2 on node JACK 29-JAN-2008 16:32:04.67 Uptime 894 22:28:52
The command output above shows that node JACK on 29 January 2008 at 16:32:04.67 has an uptime of 894 days 22 hours 28 minutes and 52 seconds.

<doc id="279594" wikidata="Q1637963" url="?curid=279594" title="Minim (unit)">
<text>The minim (abbreviated min, [[♏|]] or [[♍|]]) is a unit of volume in both the imperial and U.S. customary systems of measurement. Specifically, in the imperial system, it is of an imperial fluid drachm or of an imperial fluid ounce; in the U.S. customary system, it is of a US customary fluid dram or of a US customary fluid ounce. 

The minim was introduced in the 1809 edition of &quot;The Pharmacopœia of the Royal College of Physicians of London&quot; as a replacement for the drop, which had previously been the smallest unit of the apothecaries&#x27; system. It was observed that the size of a drop can vary considerably depending upon the viscosity and specific gravity of the liquid. (At the time, the phenomenon of surface tension was not well understood.) The minim, on the other hand, was measured with a graduated glass tube known as a &quot;minimometer&quot;, later known as the minim-tube. The minim-tube was a type of graduated pipette, a device invented in 1791 by François-Antoine-Henri Descroizilles.

Apothecaries&#x27; measures are fully defined in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Weights and Measures Act 1878, but the UK&#x27;s Weights and Measures Act 1963 provided for the abolition of the minim, fluid scruple, and fluid drachm, all already obsolete. Actual delegalization occurred on 1 February 1971.

The use of the minim, along with other such measures, has been reduced by the adoption of the metric system, and even in the least metricated countries, pharmacy is largely metricated and the apothecaries&#x27; system is deprecated. The unit may rarely persist in some countries in the measurement of dosages of medicine.

<doc id="279597" wikidata="Q863333" url="?curid=279597" title="Bilocation">
<text>Bilocation, or sometimes multilocation, is an alleged psychic or miraculous ability wherein an individual or object is located (or appears to be located) in two distinct places at the same time. Reports of bilocational phenomena have been made in a wide variety of historical and religious contexts, ranging from ancient Greek legends and Christian traditions to modern occultism.

==In ancient Greece==
The ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras was said to have been capable of bilocation. According to Porphyry (writing several centuries after Pythagoras):

A similar story is told of Apollonius of Tyana, who was supposedly present simultaneously in Smyrna and Ephesus.

==In religion and mysticism==
The concept of bilocation has been linked with shamanism, Theosophy, Islam (especially Sufism) and Jewish mysticism.

===Hinduism and Buddhism===
It is also one of the &quot;siddhis&quot; of Hinduism and Buddhism. Several prominent Hindu gurus, including Neem Karoli Baba, Sri Yukteswar and Lahiri Mahasaya, have been reported to have this ability.

===Christianity===
The history of Christianity contains many reports of miraculous bilocations. Among the earliest of these is the apparition of Our Lady of the Pillar. This is an alleged appearance of the Virgin Mary in Caesaraugusta, Spain, in the year 40AD, at a time when she is believed to have been still alive and living in Jerusalem.
Other Christian figures said to have experienced bilocation include Catherine de&#x27; Ricci, Saint Drogo, Anthony of Padua, Francis of Paola, Francis Xavier, Martin de Porres, María de Ágreda, Alphonsus Liguori, Gerard Majella and Pio of Pietrelcina.

However, some Catholic philosophers disagree as to whether a person can really be physically located in two places at once, or whether the bilocations of the saints only take the form of non-substantial apparitions.

===Witchcraft===
In the 17th century, persons accused of witchcraft were often reported to appear to their victims in visions, even if they were known to be elsewhere at the time. The trials at Bury St. Edmunds and Salem included this &quot;spectral evidence&quot; against defendants. Matthew Hopkins described the phenomenon in his book &quot;The Discovery of Witches&quot;.

===Occultism===
Émilie Sagée, a French teacher working in 1845 in a boarding school in Latvia, was supposed to have had the ability of bilocation.

===New Religious Movements===
The English occultist Aleister Crowley was reported by acquaintances to have the ability to bilocate, even though he said he was not conscious of its happening at the time.

==Skepticism==
Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that there is no scientific evidence that bilocation is a real phenomenon and that cases are often from anecdotal reports that cannot be verified.

==Cultural influence==
Bilocation figures heavily in David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997) and both Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Against the Day&quot; (2006) and Tim Powers&#x27; novel &quot;Declare&quot; (2000). Bilocation also plays a part in the Christopher Priest novel &quot;The Prestige&quot;. Additionally, the phenomenon is explored in an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, and several season two episodes of &quot;Alcoa Presents One Step Beyond&quot;, including &quot;Dead Ringer&quot;.

A mystical story that involved Soviet author Yevgeny Petrov served as inspiration for the film &quot;Envelope&quot; (2012), starring Kevin Spacey.

The phenomenon is one of the main ideas in Stephen King&#x27;s fiction novel &quot;The Outsider&quot;, even mentioning real-life references in one occasion.

<text>The sugarbirds are a small genus, Promerops, and family, Promeropidae, of passerine birds, restricted to southern Africa. In general appearance and habits, they resemble large, long-tailed sunbirds or some of the Australian honeyeaters, but are not closely related to the former and are even more distantly related to the latter. They have brownish plumage, the long downcurved bill typical of passerine nectar feeders, and long tail feathers.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Promerops&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the Cape sugarbird (&quot;Promerops cafer&quot;) as the type species. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek προ &quot;pro&quot; &quot;close to&quot; or &quot;similar&quot; and the genus&quot; Merops &quot;that contains the bee-eaters.

The relationships of the sugarbirds have been a source of considerable debate. They were first treated as a far-flung member of the honeyeater family, which is otherwise restricted to the Australasian region. Using egg white proteins in the 1970s, Sibley and Ahlquist mistakenly placed them with the starlings (the samples used were actually those of sunbirds). They have also been linked to the thrushes (Turdidae) and the sunbirds. Molecular studies find support for few close relatives, and they are treated as a monotypic family at present, although they form a clade with the Modulatricidae, three enigmatic African species formerly placed with the Old World babblers and thrushes.

=== Genetic diversity ===
Both species have been shown to exhibit exceptionally high genetic diversity at both microsatellite and mitochondrial loci, with no signs of inbreeding and large effective population sizes.

==Species==
The genus contains two species:
==Description==

The two sugarbird species are medium-sized passerines that weigh between and are in length. Between of that length is in their massively elongated tails, the tails of the Cape sugarbird being overall longer than those of Gurney&#x27;s sugarbird. In both species, the tail of the male is longer than the female, although the difference is more pronounced in the Cape sugarbird. In overall body size, the males are slightly larger and heavier than the females. Both species have long and slender bills that are slightly curved, and again the females have a slightly shorter bill, leading to differences in feeding niches. The skull and tongue morphologies of the sugarbirds are very similar to that of the honeyeaters, the result of convergent evolution. The tongue is long and protrusible, and is tubular and frilled at the end.

==Distribution and habitat==
Gurney&#x27;s sugarbird is found from Zimbabwe southwards, except the extreme south of South Africa, where it is replaced by the Cape sugarbird in the Cape provinces of South Africa. It has at times been considered conspecific with Gurney&#x27;s. The distribution of Gurney&#x27;s sugarbird is disjunct, and currently two subspecies are accepted, one in the north and one further south.

Sugarbirds are dependent on &quot;Protea&quot; and are found in protea scrub. The Cape sugarbird is found in fynbos and has also moved into gardens and nurseries.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Nectar from the inflorescences of the &quot;Protea&quot; provide most of the energy these birds require, and they are considered significant pollinators of the genus. The birds&#x27; diet is supplemented by insects attracted to the inflorescences. Studies of their diets found that bees in the family Apidae and flies formed a large part of the diet and that the insects were obtained by hawking.

The breeding behaviour and nesting habits of the two species of sugarbird are very similar. Sugarbirds are monogamous, and male sugarbirds defend territories during the breeding season. Females lay two eggs in a nest in a fork of a tree.

<text>Communication Canada was an agency of the Department of Public Works and Government Services in the Government of Canada. Its responsibility was primarily for keeping federal government departments and their agencies connected with Canadian citizens. Responsibility for developing the federal government&#x27;s web presence and primary web site rested with Communication Canada.

The agency was created in the mid-1990s following the 1995 Quebec referendum, ostensibly to promote federal government communications with all of Canada; however, many Canadians viewed it as a government propaganda agency. Communication Canada became linked to the Sponsorship Scandal and was disbanded in a federal government reorganization at the end of the fiscal year, effective March 31, 2004.

Communication Canada was accountable to its Executive Director, who reported to the Chair of the Cabinet Committee on Government Communications and there was a Minister Responsible for Communication Canada.
On April 1, 2004, the agency was disbanded and its responsibilities divided among the Department of Public Works and Government Services and the Privy Council Office.

Communications Canada was created in 1969 as the Department of Communications and was headed by the Minister of Communications. It was disbanded in 1995 with its responsibilities for telecommunications going to Industry Canada and culture going to Canadian Heritage.

<doc id="279604" wikidata="Q2004836" url="?curid=279604" title="Bay Middleton">
<text>Captain William George Middleton (16 April 1846 – 9 April 1892) was a noted British horseman, officer of the Royal Lancers, and equerry to Lord Spencer, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was described as &quot;one of the best riders to hounds that ever lived, an amusing dare-devil and very good company.&quot;

His nickname &quot;Bay&quot; was either a reference to his reddish-brown hair, or derived from the name of the winner of The Derby winner in 1836.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
William George Middleton was born at Barony, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland, the son of George Middleton and Mary Margaret Hamilton. He was born into a Scottish family with sporting traditions. He attended the Glasgow Academy. The family having moved to London, he was privately tutored at Wimbledon.

=== Career ===
Middleton was gazetted to the 12th Lancers in 1865, and stationed in Cahir in County Tipperary. He rode his first Winning Race in 1867 at Cork Park. He joined the Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s staff as an aide-de-camp in 1870, where he was based at the Viceregal Lodge in Dublin, was promoted to captain and left services. Middleton was one of the best and most popular riders in the United Kingdom. He repeatedly rode the winners over the stiffest steeplechase courses, including the Punchestown (Ireland) Grand National. Besides being distinguished as a horseman, he was a good cricketer, belonging to the Jockey Cricket Club.

=== Empress of Austria ===

The Empress Elisabeth of Austria (&quot;Sisi&quot;) visited England, arriving on 2 August 1874, where she met the Earl Spencer and his equerry Middleton. When she returned to England in 1876, she visited Lord Spencer at Althorp, and Bay Middleton was asked to &quot;pilot&quot; the Empress. She left England in February 1882 and never hunted in England or Ireland again.

=== Marriage ===
In 1875, Middleton became engaged to Charlotte Baird, daughter of William Baird, of Elie, whom he married on 25 October 1882 at St. George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. The couple had one daughter, Violet Georgiana, born in 1886.

=== Death ===
Captain William George Middleton died at age 45 in the Midland Sportsman&#x27;s Cup at Lord Willoughby de Broke&#x27;s estate at Kineton, killed in a fall from his horse at the Parliamentary steeplechase. He was buried in full riding costume at Haselbech, Northamptonshire. His coffin was kept in the parish church, covered with the Union Jack and flanked with lances of the 12th Lancers, Middleton&#x27;s regiment. A large assembly of mourners gathered to attend the funeral service, which was conducted by the Rev. W. Lloyd, the rector. Among the mourners were the widow and the deceased&#x27;s only (officially acknowledged) child, a little girl of six. Earl Spencer, Lord and Lady Willoughby de Broke, Sir Saville Crossley, M.P., Mr. Albert Pell, Captain William Cossley Atherton, Mr. Charles. W. B. Fernie, General Le Quesne, and many others who were well known in the hunting field also attended Middleton&#x27;s funeral.

==In ballet, literature and film==
Middleton appears as the Empress&#x27;s lover in Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s ballet &quot;Mayerling&quot;.

Middleton&#x27;s courtship of Charlotte Baird and his relationship with the Empress are the focus of Daisy Goodwin&#x27;s novel&quot; The Fortune Hunter.&quot;

Middleton is portrayed by Colin Morgan in the 2022 historical drama film Corsage written and directed by Marie Kreutzer.

<text>María Corazón &quot;Cory&quot; Sumulong Cojuangco-Aquino (; January 25, 1933 – August 1, 2009) was a Filipino politician who served as the 11th president of the Philippines and the first woman president in the country, from 1986 to 1992. She was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution, which ended the two-decade rule of President Ferdinand Marcos and led to the establishment of the current democratic Fifth Philippine Republic.

Aquino was married to Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., who was one of the most prominent critics of President Marcos. After the assassination of her husband on August 21, 1983, she emerged as leader of the opposition against the president. In late 1985, Marcos called for a snap election, and Aquino ran for president with former Senator Salvador Laurel as her running mate for vice president. After the election held on February 7, 1986, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate Arturo Tolentino as the winners, which prompted allegations of electoral fraud and Aquino&#x27;s call for massive civil disobedience actions. Subsequently, the People Power Revolution, a non-violent mass demonstration movement, took place from February 22 to 25. The People Power Revolution, along with defections from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and support from the Philippine Catholic Church, ousted Marcos and secured Aquino&#x27;s accession to the presidency on February 25, 1986. Prior to her election as president, Aquino had not held any elected office. She was the first female president of the Philippines.

As president, Aquino oversaw the drafting of the 1987 Constitution, which limited the powers of the presidency and re-established the bicameral Congress, removing the previous dictatorial government structure. Her economic policies focused on forging good economic standing amongst the international community as well as disestablishing Marcos-era crony capitalist monopolies, emphasizing the free market and responsible economy. Her administration pursued peace talks to resolve the Moro conflict, and the result of these talks was creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Aquino was criticized for the Mendiola Massacre, which resulted in the shooting deaths of at least 12 peaceful protesters by Philippine state security forces. The Philippines faced various natural calamities in the latter part of Aquino&#x27;s administration, such as the 1990 Luzon earthquake, 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption and Tropical Storm Thelma. Several coup attempts were made against her government. She was succeeded as president by Fidel V. Ramos and returned to civilian life in 1992.

Aquino was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2008 and died on August 1, 2009. Her son Benigno Aquino III served as president of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016. After her death, monuments were built and public landmarks were named in honor of Corazon Aquino all around the Philippines. Aquino was regarded as the &quot;Mother of Democracy&quot;.

==Early life and education==
María Corazón Sumulong Cojuangco was born on January 25, 1933, in Paniqui, Tarlac. She was born to the prominent Cojuangco family. Her father was José Cojuangco, a prominent Tarlac businessman and former congressman, and her mother was Demetria Sumulong, a pharmacist. Both of Aquino&#x27;s parents were from prominent political families. Aquino&#x27;s grandfather from her father&#x27;s side, Melecio Cojuangco, was a member of the historic Malolos Congress, and Aquino&#x27;s mother belonged to the politically influential Sumulong family of Rizal province, which included Juan Sumulong, who ran against Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon in 1941 and Senator Lorenzo Sumulong, who was later appointed by Aquino in the Constitutional Commission. Aquino was the sixth of eight children, two of whom died in infancy. Her siblings were Pedro, Josephine, Teresita, Jose Jr., and Maria Paz.

Aquino spent her elementary school days at St. Scholastica&#x27;s College in Manila, where she graduated at the top of her class as valedictorian. She transferred to Assumption Convent, then also in Manila, to pursue high school studies. After her family moved to the United States, she attended the Assumption-run Ravenhill Academy in Philadelphia. She then transferred to Notre Dame Convent School in New York City, where she graduated from in 1949. During her high school years in the United States, Aquino volunteered for the campaign of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey against Democratic incumbent U.S. President Harry S. Truman during the 1948 United States presidential election. After graduating from high school, she pursued her college education at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in New York, graduating in 1953 with a major in French and minor in mathematics.

==Wife of Benigno Aquino Jr.==
After graduating from college, she returned to the Philippines and studied law at Far Eastern University in 1953. While attending, she met Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; S. Aquino Jr., who was the son of the late Speaker Benigno S. Aquino Sr. and a grandson of General Servillano Aquino. She discontinued her law education and married Benigno at the Our Lady of Sorrows Parish in Pasay, Rizal on October 11, 1954. The couple had five children: Maria Elena (&quot;Ballsy&quot;; born 1955), Aurora Corazon (&quot;Pinky&quot;; born 1957), Benigno Simeon III (&quot;Noynoy&quot;; 1960–2021), Victoria Elisa (&quot;Viel&quot;; born 1961) and Kristina Bernadette (&quot;Kris&quot;; born 1971).

Aquino had initially had difficulty adjusting to provincial life when she and her husband moved to Concepcion, Tarlac in 1955. Aquino found herself bored in Concepcion, and welcomed the opportunity to have dinner with her husband inside the American military facility at nearby Clark Field. Afterwards, the Aquino family moved to a bungalow in suburban Quezon City.

Throughout her life, Aquino was known to be a devout Roman Catholic.

Corazon Aquino was fluent in French, Japanese, Spanish, and English aside from her native Tagalog and Kapampangan.

Benigno Aquino Jr., a member of the Liberal Party, rose to become the youngest governor in the country in 1961 and then the youngest senator ever elected to the Senate of the Philippines in 1967. For most of her husband&#x27;s political career, Aquino remained a housewife who raised their children and hosted her spouse&#x27;s political allies who would visit their Quezon City home. She would decline to join her husband on stage during campaign rallies, instead preferring to be in the back of the audience and listen to him. Unbeknownst to many at the time, Corazon Aquino sold some of her prized inheritance to fund the candidacy of her husband.

As Benigno Aquino Jr. emerged as a leading critic of the government of President Ferdinand Marcos, he became seen as a strong candidate for president to succeed Marcos in the 1973 elections. However, Marcos, who was barred by the 1935 Constitution to seek a third term, declared martial law on September 21, 1972 and later abolished the constitution, thereby allowing him to remain in office. Benigno Aquino Jr. was among the first to be arrested at the onset of martial law, and was later sentenced to death. During her husband&#x27;s incarceration, Corazon Aquino stopped going to beauty salons or buying new clothes and prohibited her children from attending parties, until a priest advised her and her children to try to live as normal lives as possible.

Despite Corazon&#x27;s initial opposition, Benigno Aquino Jr. decided to run in the 1978 Batasang Pambansa elections from his prison cell as party leader of the newly created LABAN. Corazon Aquino campaigned on behalf of her husband and delivered a political speech for the first time in her life during this political campaign. In 1980 Benigno Aquino Jr. suffered a heart attack, and Marcos allowed Senator Aquino and his family to leave for exile in the United States upon intervention from U.S. President Jimmy Carter so that Aquino could seek medical treatment. The family settled in Boston, and Corazon Aquino would later recall the next three years as the happiest days of her marriage and family life.

On August 21, 1983, Benigno Aquino Jr. ended his stay in the United States and returned without his family to the Philippines, where he was immediately assassinated on a staircase leading to the tarmac of Manila International Airport. The airport is now named Ninoy Aquino International Airport, renamed by the Congress in his honor in 1987. Corazon Aquino returned to the Philippines a few days later and led her husband&#x27;s funeral procession, in which more than two million people participated.

==1986 presidential campaign==
Following her husband&#x27;s assassination in 1983, Corazon Aquino became active in various demonstrations held against the Marcos regime. She began to assume the mantle of leadership left by her husband and became a figurehead of the anti-Marcos political opposition. On November 3, 1985, during an interview with American journalist David Brinkley on &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot;, Marcos suddenly announced snap elections that would be held within three months to dispel doubt against his regime&#x27;s legitimate authority, an action that surprised the nation. The election was later scheduled to be held on February 7, 1986. A petition was organized to urge Aquino to run for president, headed by former newspaper publisher Joaquin Roces. On December 1, the petition of 1.2 million signatures was publicly presented to Aquino in an event attended by 15,000 people, and on December 3, Aquino officially declared her candidacy. United Opposition (UNIDO) party leader Salvador Laurel was chosen as Aquino&#x27;s running mate as candidate for vice president.

During the campaign, Marcos attacked Corazon Aquino on her husband&#x27;s previous ties to communists, characterizing the election as a fight &quot;between democracy and communism&quot;. Aquino refuted Marcos&#x27; charge and stated that she would not appoint a single communist to her cabinet. Marcos also accused Aquino of playing &quot;political football&quot; with the United States in regards to the continued United States military presence in the Philippines at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base. Another point of attack for Marcos was Aquino&#x27;s inexperience in public office. Marcos&#x27; campaign was characterized by sexist attacks, such as remarks by Marcos that Aquino was &quot;just a woman&quot; and that a woman&#x27;s remarks should be limited to the bedroom.

The snap election was held on February 7, 1986, and was marred by massive electoral fraud, violence, intimidation, coercion, and disenfranchisement of voters. On February 11, while votes were still being tabulated, former Antique Governor Evelio Javier, who had been director of Aquino&#x27;s campaign in Antique, was assassinated. During the tallying of votes conducted by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), 30 poll computer technicians walked out to contest the alleged election-rigging being done in favor of Marcos. Years later it was claimed that the walkout of computer technicians was led by Linda Kapunan, wife of Lt Col Eduardo Kapunan, a leader of Reform the Armed Forces Movement that plotted to attack the Malacañang Palace and kill Marcos and his family, leading to a partial reevaluation of the walkout event.

On February 15, 1986, the Batasang Pambansa, which was dominated by Marcos&#x27; ruling party and its allies, declared President Marcos as the winner of the election. However, NAMFREL&#x27;s electoral count showed that Corazon Aquino had won. Aquino claimed victory according to NAMFREL&#x27;s electoral count and called for a rally dubbed &quot;Tagumpay ng Bayan&quot; (People&#x27;s Victory Rally) the following day to protest the declaration by the Batasang Pambansa. Aquino also called for boycotts against products and services from companies controlled or owned by individuals closely allied with Marcos. The rally was held at the historic Rizal Park in Luneta, Manila and drew a pro-Aquino crowd of around two million people. The dubious election results drew condemnation from both domestic and foreign powers. The Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines issued a statement strongly criticizing the conduct of the election, describing the election as violent and fraudulent. The United States Senate likewise condemned the election. Aquino rejected a power-sharing agreement proposed by the American diplomat Philip Habib, who had been sent as an emissary by U.S. President Ronald Reagan to help defuse the tension.

===Accession as president===
On February 22, 1986, disgruntled and reformist military officers led by Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel V. Ramos surprised the nation and the international community by the announcement of their defection from the Marcos government, citing a strong belief that Aquino was the real winner in the contested presidential election. Enrile, Ramos, and the rebel soldiers then set up operations in Camp Aguinaldo, the headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and Camp Crame, the headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary, across Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA). Cardinal Sin appealed to the public in a broadcast over Church-run Radyo Veritas, and millions of Filipinos gathered to the part of Epifanio De Los Santos Avenue between the two camps to give their support and prayers to the rebels. At that time, Aquino was meditating in a Carmelite convent in Cebu. Upon learning of the defection, Aquino and Cardinal Sin appeared on Radyo Veritas to rally behind Enrile and Ramos. Aquino then flew back to Manila to prepare for the takeover of the government.

Aquino was sworn in as the eleventh president of the Philippines on February 25, 1986. An hour after Aquino&#x27;s inauguration, Marcos held his own inauguration ceremony at the Malacañang Palace. Later that same day, Ferdinand E. Marcos fled from the Philippines to Hawaii.

== Presidency (1986–1992) ==
Corazon Aquino&#x27;s accession to the presidency marked the end of authoritarian rule in the Philippines. Aquino is the first female president of the Philippines and is still the only president of the Philippines to have never held any prior political position. Aquino is regarded as the first female president in Asia.

===Transitional government and creation of new constitution===

On February 25, 1986, the first day of her administration, Aquino issued Proclamation No. 1, which announced an intention to reorganize the government and called on all officials appointed by Marcos to resign, starting with members of the Supreme Court. On March 25, 1986, President Aquino issued , which announced a transitional government into a democratic system. She abolished the 1973 Constitution that was in force during the martial law era, and by decree issued the provisional 1986 Freedom Constitution, pending the ratification of a more formal and comprehensive charter. This constitutional allowed her to exercise both executive and legislative powers during the period of transitional government.

After the issuance of Proclamation No. 1, all 15 members of the Supreme Court submitted their resignations. Aquino then reorganized the membership of the Supreme Court with the stated purpose of restoring its judicial independence. On May 22, 1986, in the case &quot;Lawyers League v. President Aquino&quot;, the reorganized Supreme Court declared the Aquino government as &quot;not merely a &quot;de facto&quot; government but in fact and law a &quot;de jure&quot; government&quot;, and affirmed its legitimacy.

Aquino appointed all 48 members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission (&quot;Con-Com&quot;), led by retired activist and former Supreme Court Associate Justice Cecilia Muñoz-Palma, which was tasked with writing a new constitution. The Commission completed its final draft of the Constitution in October 1986.

On February 2, 1987, the Constitution of the Philippines was ratified by nationwide plebiscite. It remains the constitution of the Philippines to the present day. The Constitution established a bill of rights and a three-branch government consisting of the executive department, the legislative department, and the judicial department. The Constitution restored the bicameral Congress, which in 1973 had been abolished by Marcos and replaced with first the Batasang Bayan and later the Batasang Pambansa. The ratification of the new Constitution was soon followed by the election of senators and the election of House of Representatives members on May 11, 1987, as well as local elections on January 18, 1988.

===Legal reforms===
After the ratification of the constitution, Aquino promulgated two landmark legal codes, namely, the Family Code of 1987, which reformed the civil law on family relations, and the Administrative Code of 1987, which reorganized the structure of the executive department of government. Another landmark law that was enacted during her tenure was the 1991 Local Government Code, which devolved national government powers to local government units (LGUs). The new Code enhanced the power of LGUs to enact local taxation measures and assured them of a share in the national revenue.

During Aquino&#x27;s tenure, vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act, and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were also enacted.

===Socio-economic policies===
The economy posted a positive growth of 3.4% during Aquino&#x27;s first year in office, and continued to grow at an overall positive rate throughout her tenure for an average rate of 3.4% from 1986 to 1992. Real GDP growth suffered a 0.4% decrease in 1991 in the aftermath of the 1989 coup attempt by the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, which shook international confidence in the Philippine economy and hindered foreign investment.

Aquino made fighting inflation one of her priorities after the nation suffered from skyrocketing prices during the last years of the Marcos administration. The last six years of the Marcos administration recorded an average annual inflation rate of 20.9%, which peaked in 1984 at 50.3%. From 1986 to 1992, the Philippines recorded an average annual inflation rate of 9.2%. During the Aquino administration, the annual inflation rate peaked at 18.1% in 1991; a stated reason for this increase was panic buying during the Gulf War. Overall, the economy under Aquino had an average growth of 3.8% from 1986 to 1992.

====De-monopolization====
One of Aquino&#x27;s first actions as president was to seize Marcos&#x27; multi-billion dollar fortune of ill-gotten wealth. On February 28, 1986, four days into her presidency, Aquino formed the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), which was tasked with retrieving Marcos&#x27; domestic and international fortune.

After his declaration of martial law in 1972 and his consolidation of authoritarian power, President Ferdinand Marcos issued various government decrees that awarded monopoly or oligopoly power over entire industries to various close associates, in a scheme later regarded as crony capitalism. President Aquino pursued a market liberalization agenda to combat this problem. President Aquino particularly targeted the sugar industry and the coconut industry for de-monopolization.

====Debt====

Throughout the tenure of President Ferdinand Marcos, government foreign debt had ballooned from less than $3 billion in 1970 to $28 billion by the end of his administration, through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. The debt had badly tarnished the international credit standing and economic reputation of the country.

President Aquino inherited the debt of the Marcos administration and weighed all options on what to do with the debt, including not paying the debt. Aquino eventually chose to honor all the debts that were previously incurred in order to clear the country&#x27;s economic reputation. Her decision proved to be unpopular but Aquino defended it, saying that was the most practical move. Beginning in 1986, the Aquino administration paid off $4 billion of the country&#x27;s outstanding debts to improve its international credit ratings and attract the attention of foreign investors. This move also ensured lower interest rates and longer payment terms for future loans. During the Aquino administration, the Philippines acquired an additional $9 billion debt, increasing the net national debt by $5 billion within six years due to the need to infuse capital and money into the economy. The Aquino administration was able to reduce the Philippines&#x27; external debt-to-GDP ratio by 30.1 percent, from 87.9 percent at the start of the administration to 67.8 percent in 1991.

====Agrarian reform====

President Aquino envisioned agrarian and land reform as the centerpiece of her administration&#x27;s social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda.

After the Mendiola Massacre and in response to calls for agrarian reform, President Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on July 22, 1987, which outlined her land reform program, including sugar lands. In 1988, with the backing of Aquino, the new Congress of the Philippines passed Republic Act No. 6657, more popularly known as the &quot;Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law&quot; (CARP), which paved the way for the redistribution of agricultural lands from landowners to tenant-farmers. Landowners were paid in exchange by the government through just compensation, and were also not allowed to retain more than five hectares of land. The law also allowed corporate landowners to &quot;voluntarily divest a proportion of their capital stock, equity or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries&quot;, in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution. Despite the flaws in the law, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1989, declaring that the implementation of CARP was &quot;a revolutionary kind of expropriation&quot;.

Corazon Aquino herself was subject to a controversy that centered on Hacienda Luisita, a 6,453-hectare estate located in the province of Tarlac which she and her siblings inherited from her father José Cojuangco. Instead of land distribution, Hacienda Luisita reorganized itself into a corporation and distributed stock. As such, ownership of agricultural portions of the hacienda was transferred to the corporation, which in turn, gave its shares of stocks to farmers. Critics argued that Aquino bowed to pressure from relatives by allowing stock redistribution in lieu of land redistribution under CARP.

The stock redistribution scheme was revoked in 2006, when the Department of Agrarian Reform ordered the mandatory redistribution of land to tenant-farmers of Hacienda Luisita. The Department of Agrarian Reform had looked into its revocation since 2004, when violence erupted in the hacienda over the retrenchment of workers, leaving seven people dead.

===Coup attempts on Aquino government===
From 1986 to 1990 numerous coup attempts were enacted on the Aquino administration and the new Philippine government. Many of these attempts were conducted by the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, who attempted to establish a military government, while other attempts were conducted by loyalists to former President Marcos.

===Mendiola massacre and cabinet infighting===

On January 22, 1987, during the era of transition government and shortly before the nationwide plebiscite to ratify the Constitution, 12 citizens were killed and 51 were injured in the Mendiola Massacre. The incident was initially a peaceful protest by agrarian workers and farmers who had marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the Malacañan Palace to demand genuine land reform. The massacre occurred when Marines fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. The massacre resulted in several resignations from Aquino&#x27;s cabinet, including Jose W. Diokno, head of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), and chairman of the government panel in charge of negotiations with rebel forces resigned from his government posts. His daughter Maris said, &quot;It was the only time we saw him near tears.&quot;

In September 1987, Vice President Doy Laurel resigned as secretary of foreign affairs. In his resignation letter to Aquino, Laurel stated, &quot;the past years of Marcos are now beginning to look no worse than your first two years in office. And the reported controversies and scandals involving your closest relatives have become the object of our people&#x27;s outrage. From 16,500 NPA regular when Marcos fell, the communists now claim an armed strength of 25,200. From city to countryside, anarchy has spread. There is anarchy within the government, anarchy within the ruling coalesced parties and anarchy in the streets.&quot;

Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin, who had successfully advocated for paying external debt incurred during Marcos&#x27; administration, was dismissed by Aquino in September 1987 and later died in an apparent suicide in December 1987. His widow stated that he had been depressed due to infighting in Aquino&#x27;s cabinet and lack of significant change since the People Power Revolution.

Soon after the Mendiola Massacre, the Aquino administration and Congress worked to pass significant agrarian reform, which culminated in the passage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARP).

===Peace talks with Moro and communist insurgencies===

President Aquino conducted peace talks with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), an armed Moro Muslim insurgency group that sought to establish an independent Moro state within Mindanao. Aquino met with MNLF leader Nur Misuari and various MNLF groups in Sulu. In 1989, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was created under Republic Act No. 6734 or the ARMM Organic Act, which established the Moro majority areas in the Mindanao island group as an autonomous region with its own government. The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao lasted from 1989 to 2019, after which it was succeeded by the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

The establishment of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was opposed by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a militant splinter group from the MNLF that sought to secede from the Philippines to establish an Islamic state in Mindanao. Peace talks with MILF began in 1997 under President Fidel Ramos and violent insurgency officially continued until 2014, when peace accords were formally signed between MILF and the administration of President Benigno Aquino III that would lead to the creation of the BARMM.

The establishment of the ARMM also led to the establishment of Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist group founded in 1989 by Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani and composed of radical former members of the MNLF. Terrorist attacks by Abu Sayyaf would start in 1995 and continue to the present day, including the 2004 bombing of the MV &quot;Superferry 14&quot; that resulted in the deaths of 116 people.

Shortly after becoming president, Aquino ordered the release of hundreds of political prisoners imprisoned during the Marcos era, including communist insurgents belonging to the Communist Party of the Philippines. These releases included leaders such as Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Maria Sison and New People&#x27;s Army founder Bernabe Buscayno, which the military strongly resisted. Preliminary peace talks with the CPP ended after the Mendiola Massacre on January 22, 1987, during which at least 12 farmers were killed at a protest rally.

===Closing of United States military bases===

Soon after Aquino took office, several Philippine senators declared that the presence of U.S. military forces in the Philippines was an affront to national sovereignty. The senators called for the United States military to vacate U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay and Clark Air Base, and Aquino opposed their demand. The United States objected by stating that they had leased the property and that the leases were still in effect. The United States stated that the facilities at Subic Bay were unequaled anywhere in Southeast Asia and a U.S. pullout could make all of that region of the world vulnerable to an incursion by the Soviet Union or by a resurgent Japan. Another issue with the demand was that thousands of Filipinos worked at these military facilities and they would lose their jobs if the U.S. military moved out. Aquino opposed the Senate&#x27;s demand and believed that the bases should have remained. Aquino organized a protest against the pullout, which only gathered between 100,000 and 150,000 supporters, far short of the 500,000 to 1 million that had been originally expected.

The matter was still being debated when Mount Pinatubo erupted in June 1991, covering the entire area with volcanic ash. Despite attempts to continue the Subic Base, Aquino finally conceded. In December 1991, the government served notice that the U.S. had to close the base by the end of 1992.

===Natural disasters and calamities===
On December 20, 1987, the MV &quot;Doña Paz&quot; sank after a collision with the oil tanker MV &quot;Vector&quot;. The final death toll exceeded 4,300 people, and the sinking has been called the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster of the 20th century. In the aftermath, Aquino addressed the incident as &quot;a national tragedy of harrowing proportions&quot;.

The 1990 Luzon earthquake was a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the island of Luzon. It left an estimate of 1,621 people dead and massive property damage.

In 1991, a volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, then thought to be dormant, killed around 800 people and caused widespread long-term devastation of agricultural lands in Central Luzon. Around 20,000 residents had to be evacuated and around 10,000 people were left homeless by the event. It was the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century.

On November 1, 1991 Tropical Storm Thelma (also known as Typhoon Uring) caused massive flooding in Ormoc City, leaving around 5,000 dead in what was then considered to be the deadliest typhoon in Philippine history. On November 8, Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area.

===Electrical power grid inadequacy===
During Aquino&#x27;s presidency, electric blackouts became common in Manila. The city experienced 7–12 hours-long blackouts, which severely affected its businesses. By the departure of Aquino in June 1992, businesses in Manila and nearby provinces had lost nearly $800 million since the preceding March.

Corazon Aquino&#x27;s decision to deactivate the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP), which was built during the Marcos administration, contributed to further electricity crises in the 1990s, as the 620 megawatts capacity of the plant would have been enough to cover the shortfall at that time. Critics of the BNPP had stated that the power plant was unsafe, and cited the millions of dollars in bribes paid to President Marcos to allow its construction. The administration had failed to provide for an adequate replacement for the plant before her term had completed, and President Corazon Aquino ended her term in 1992 with the country reeling under a severe power shortage crisis.

===Influence in 1992 presidential election===
The 1987 Constitution limited the president to a single six-year term with no possibility of re-election. As the end of her presidency drew near, close advisers and friends told Aquino that since she was not inaugurated under the 1987 Constitution, her term beginning 1986, she was still &#x27;eligible&#x27; to seek the presidency again in the upcoming 1992 elections, the first presidential elections held under normal and peaceful circumstances since 1965. However, Aquino firmly declined the requests for her to seek reelection, citing her strong belief that the presidency was not a lifetime position.

Initially, she named Ramon V. Mitra, Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives who had been a friend of her husband, as her preferred candidate for the 1992 presidential elections. However, she later backtracked and instead supported the candidacy of General Fidel V. Ramos, who was her defense secretary and a key figure in the EDSA Revolution. Ramos had consistently stood by her government during the various coup attempts that were launched against her administration. Her sudden change of mind and withdrawal of support from Mitra drew criticism from her supporters in the liberal and social democratic sectors. Her decision also drew criticism from the Catholic Church, which questioned her support of Ramos due to his being a Protestant. General Ramos won the 1992 elections with 23.58% of the total votes in a wide-open campaign.

On June 30, 1992, Corazon Aquino formally and peacefully handed over power to Fidel Ramos. On that day, Fidel V. Ramos was inaugurated as the twelfth president of the Philippines. After the inauguration, Aquino left the ceremony in a simple white Toyota Crown she had purchased, rather than the lavish government-issued Mercedes-Benz in which she and Ramos had ridden on the way to the ceremonies, to make the point that she was once again an ordinary citizen.

=== Administration and cabinet ===
== Post-presidency (1992-2009) ==
===Domestic===
During Aquino&#x27;s retirement and stay as a private citizen, she remained active in the Philippine political scene. Aquino would voice her dissent to government actions and policies that she deemed threats to the democratic foundations of the country.

In 1997, Aquino, together with Cardinal Jaime Sin, led a rally opposing President Fidel Ramos&#x27; attempt to extend his term through his proposal to amend the 1987 Constitution&#x27;s restriction on presidential term limits. Ramos&#x27; proposed charter change would fail, leaving term limits and the presidential system in place.

During the 1998 Philippine presidential election, Aquino endorsed the candidacy of former police general and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim from the Liberal Party for president. Lim would lose to Vice President Joseph Estrada, who won by a landslide. In 1999, Aquino and Cardinal Jaime Sin again worked together to oppose a second plan to amend the Constitution to remove term limits, this time under President Estrada. President Estrada stated that his plan to amend the Constitution was intended to lift provisions that &#x27;restrict&#x27; economic activities and investments, and Estrada denied that it was an attempt to extend his stay in office. Estrada&#x27;s proposed charter change would also fail.

In 2000, Aquino joined the mounting calls for Estrada to resign from office, amid a series of corruption scandals, including strong allegations of bribery charges and gambling kickbacks. Estrada was impeached by the House of Representatives in November 2000 but acquitted by the Senate in December, which in January 2001 led to the Second EDSA Revolution, which ousted Estrada. During the Second EDSA Revolution, Aquino enthusiastically supported the ascendancy of Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to the position of president. In the subsequent trial of Joseph Estrada, Estrada was acquitted of perjury but found guilty of plunder and sentenced to &quot;reclusion perpetua&quot; with the accessory penalties of perpetual disqualification from public office and forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth on September 12, 2007. Estrada was pardoned by President Macapagal-Arroyo on October 26, 2007.

In 2005, after a series of revelations and exposes that implicated President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in rigging the 2004 presidential elections, Aquino called on Arroyo to resign in order to prevent bloodshed, violence and further political deterioration. Aquino once again led massive street-level demonstrations, this time demanding the resignation of President Arroyo.

During the 2007 senatorial elections, Aquino actively campaigned for her only son, Benigno &quot;Noynoy&quot; Aquino III, who went on to win his race. Less than a year after Corazon Aquino&#x27;s death in 2009, Benigno Aquino III won the 2010 Philippine presidential election and served as the 15th president of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016.

In December 2008, Corazon Aquino publicly expressed regret for her participation in the 2001 Second EDSA Revolution, which installed Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as president. She apologized to former President Joseph Estrada for the role she played in his ouster in 2001. Aquino&#x27;s apology drew criticisms from numerous politicians. In June 2009, two months before her death, Aquino issued a public statement in which she strongly denounced and condemned the Arroyo administration&#x27;s plans of amending the 1987 Constitution, calling it a &quot;shameless abuse of power&quot;.

===International===
Shortly after leaving the presidency, Aquino traveled abroad, giving speeches and lectures on issues of democracy, development, human rights, and women empowerment. At the 1994 meeting of the UNESCO World Commission on Culture and Development in Manila, Aquino delivered a speech urging the unconditional release of Burmese democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi from detention. She petitioned for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.

Aquino was a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international organization of former and current female heads of state, from the group&#x27;s inception in 1996 to her death.

In 1997, Aquino attended the wake and funeral of Saint Mother Teresa of Calcutta, whom she met during the latter&#x27;s visit in Manila in 1989. In 2005, Aquino joined the international community in mourning the death of Pope John Paul II.

In 2002, Aquino became the first woman named to the Board of Governors at the Asian Institute of Management, a leading graduate business school and think tank in the Asia Pacific region. She served on the Board until 2006.

===Charitable and social initiatives===
After her term as president, Aquino was involved in several charitable activities and socio-economic initiatives. From 1992 until her death, Aquino was chairperson of the Benigno S. Aquino Jr. Foundation, which she set up in her husband&#x27;s honor after his assassination in 1983. Aquino supported the Gawad Kalinga social housing project for the poor and homeless. In 2007, Aquino helped establish the PinoyME Foundation, a non-profit organization that aims to provide microfinancing programs and projects for the poor. Aquino also painted and would occasionally give away her paintings to friends and family or auction her paintings and donate the proceeds to charity. She never sold her art for her own profit.

==Illness and death==

On March 24, 2008, Aquino&#x27;s family announced that the former president had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Upon her being earlier informed by her doctors that she had only three months to live, she pursued medical treatment and chemotherapy. A series of healing Masses for Aquino, who was a devout Catholic, were held throughout the country for her recovery. In a public statement during one healing Mass on May 13, 2008, Aquino said that her blood tests indicated that she was responding well to treatment, although her hair and appetite loss were apparent.

By July 2009, Aquino was reported to be suffering from loss of appetite and in very serious condition. At that time she was confined to Makati Medical Center. It was later announced that Aquino and her family had decided to stop chemotherapy and other medical interventions for her.

Aquino died in the Makati Medical Center at 3:18 a.m. on August 1, 2009, due to cardiorespiratory arrest at the age of 76.

===Wake and funeral===


On the day of Aquino&#x27;s death, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president and issued Administrative Order No. 269 detailing the necessary arrangements for a state funeral. Arroyo was on a state visit to the United States at the time of Aquino&#x27;s death and returned to the Philippines on August 5, cutting her visit short to pay her last respects to Aquino. Aquino&#x27;s children declined Arroyo&#x27;s offer of a state funeral for their mother.

All churches in the Philippines celebrated requiem masses simultaneously throughout the country and all government offices flew the Philippine flag at half-mast. Hours after her death, Aquino&#x27;s body lay in repose for public viewing at the La Salle Green Hills campus in Mandaluyong. On August 3, 2009, Aquino&#x27;s body was transferred from La Salle Greenhills to the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, during which hundreds of thousands of Filipinos lined the streets to view and escort the former leader&#x27;s body. On the way to the cathedral, Aquino&#x27;s funeral cortege passed along Ayala Avenue in Makati, stopping in front of the monument to her husband Ninoy, where throngs of mourners gathered and sang the patriotic protest anthem &quot;&quot;Bayan Ko&quot;. Aquino&#x27;s casket was brought inside the cathedral by mid-afternoon that day. Following her death, all Roman Catholic dioceses in the country held Requiem Masses.

On August 4, 2009, Bongbong Marcos and Imee Marcos, two prominent children of late former President Ferdinand Marcos, paid their last respects to Aquino in spite of the two families&#x27; longstanding feud. The Marcos siblings were received by Aquino&#x27;s daughters María Elena, Aurora Corazon, and Victoria Elisa.

A final Requiem Mass was held on the morning of August 5, 2009, with Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, Bishop of Balanga Socrates B. Villegas, and other high-ranking clergymen concelebrating. Aquino&#x27;s daughter Kris spoke on behalf of her family towards the end of the Mass. Aquino&#x27;s flag-draped casket was escorted from the cathedral to Manila Memorial Park in Parañaque, where she was interred beside her husband in her family mausoleum. Aquino&#x27;s funeral procession took more than eight hours to reach the burial site, as tens of thousands of civilians lined the route to pay their respects. Philippine Air Force UH-1 helicopters showered the procession with yellow confetti and ships docked at Manila&#x27;s harbor blared their sirens to salute the late president.

===Reaction===
Both local and international leaders showed respect for Aquino&#x27;s achievements in the process of democratization in the Philippines.

====National reaction====
Various politicians across the political spectrum expressed their grief and praise for the former Philippine leader. President Arroyo, once an ally of Aquino, remembered the sacrifices she made for the country and called her a &quot;national treasure&quot;. Former President Estrada said that the country had lost its mother and guiding voice with her sudden death. He also described Aquino as the &quot;Philippines&#x27; most loved woman&quot;. Although they were at one time political foes, Aquino and Estrada had reconciled and joined forces in opposing President Arroyo.

Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Maria Sison joined in mourning Aquino&#x27;s death, saying his relationship with her was &quot;exceptional&quot;. Former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, who had been Aquino&#x27;s defense minister and later a fierce critic of Aquino, asked the public to pray for her eternal repose. Although former Aquino interior minister and Senate minority floor leader Aquilino Pimentel Jr. revealed that he had &quot;mixed feelings&quot; about Aquino&#x27;s death, he also said that the country &quot;shall be forever indebted to Cory for rallying the nation behind the campaign to topple dictatorial rule and restore democracy&quot;.

Filipino citizens throughout the country wore either yellow shirts or held masses to pay tribute to Aquino. Yellow ribbons, which were a symbol of support for Aquino after the 1986 election and during the People Power Revolution, were tied along major national roads as a sign of solidarity and support for Aquino and her grieving family. On popular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, Filipinos posted yellow ribbons on their accounts as tribute. Following her death, Filipino Catholics called on the Church to have Aquino canonized and declared as a saint. Days after her funeral, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) announced that it supported calls to put the former president on the 500-Peso banknote alongside Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr., her deceased husband. The bill had previously featured a portrait of only Benigno Aquino Jr. since 1987.

====International reaction====
Messages of sympathy were sent by various national heads of state and international leaders.

Pope Benedict XVI, in his letter to Archbishop Rosales, recalled Aquino&#x27;s &quot;courageous commitment to the freedom of the Filipino people, her firm rejection of violence and intolerance&quot; and called her a woman of courage and faith.

U.S. President Barack Obama, through White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, said that &quot;her courage, determination, and moral leadership are an inspiration to us all and exemplify the best in the Filipino nation&quot;. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed sadness over the death of Aquino, to whom she had sent a personal letter of best wishes for recovery while she was still in hospital in July 2009. Clinton said that Aquino was &quot;admired by the world for her extraordinary courage&quot; in leading the fight against dictatorship.

South African President Jacob Zuma called Aquino &quot;a great leader who set a shining example of peaceful transition to democracy in her country&quot;.

Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, through the British Ambassador in Manila, sent a message to the Filipino people which read: &quot;I am saddened to hear of the death of Corazon &#x27;Cory&#x27; Aquino the former president of the Republic of the Philippines&quot;. She also added, &quot;I send my sincere condolences to her family and to the people of the Philippines. Signed, Elizabeth R&quot;.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated in a telegram to President Arroyo that &quot;the name of Corazon Aquino is associated with a period of profound reforms and the democratic transformation of Filipino society&quot;. Medvedev also lauded Aquino&#x27;s sympathy to Russian people and her contribution to the improvement of Russian-Filipino relations.

Timor-Leste President José Ramos-Horta and Wan Azizah, wife of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, came to the Philippines to express their sympathies and attend Aquino&#x27;s funeral.

Soon after her 2010 release from her two-decade prison sentence, Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar publicly cited Aquino as one of her inspirations. She also expressed her good wishes for Aquino&#x27;s son, then-incumbent president of the Philippines Benigno S. Aquino III.

==In popular culture==
In 2008, a musical play about Aquino entitled &quot;Cory, the Musical&quot; was staged at the Meralco Theater. It was written and directed by Nestor Torre Jr. and starred Isay Alvarez as Aquino. The musical featured a libretto of 19 original songs composed by Lourdes Pimentel, wife of Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr.

==Legacy and honors==


After her peaceful accession to the presidency and the ousting of President Marcos, Aquino was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Woman of the Year in 1986. In August 1999, Aquino was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 20 Most Influential Asians of the 20th century. &quot;Time&quot; also cited her as one of 65 great Asian Heroes in November 2006.

In 1994, Aquino was cited as one of &quot;100 Women Who Shaped World History&quot; in a reference book written by Gail Meyer Rolka.

In 1996, she received the J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding from the Fulbright Association.

In 1998, she was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award in recognition of her role in peaceful revolution to attain democracy.

Since her death in 2009, the legacy of Corazon Aquino has prompted various namings of public landmarks and creations of memorials. Among these are as follows:
* On November 30, 2009, Aquino&#x27;s name was enshrined at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani, a monument dedicated to individuals who fought for the restoration of Philippine democracy and opposed the Marcos dictatorship. Her husband Ninoy was among the first to be enshrined at the monument&#x27;s Wall of Remembrance.
* On August 1, 2010, the first anniversary of her death, a 200 ft by 250 ft photo mosaic of Aquino was unveiled near the Quirino Grandstand at the Luneta Park in the presence of her son, President Benigno Aquino III, and her supporters. It was submitted to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; to be certified as the largest photo mosaic in the world, and the record was later certified by the World Record Academy (which is not affiliated with &quot;Guinness&quot;).
* On October 9, 2010, Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim inaugurated a public market in Baseco, Port Area known as the President Corazon C. Aquino Public Market.
* On December 16, 2010, President Benigno Aquino III and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) announced the release of newly designed 500-peso banknotes that feature both Senator Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr. and Corazon Aquino. The previous design featured only Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr. and had been in circulation since 1987.
* On February 13, 2013, the Corazon Aquino Democratic Space was launched at the De La Salle University, alongside the formal inauguration of the new Henry Sy, Sr. Hall.
* On July 28, 2014, the &quot;Republic Act No. 10663&quot;, which named a circumferential road in Iloilo City to President Corazon C. Aquino Avenue, was signed into law by President Benigno Aquino III.
* In 2015, the new Corazon C. Aquino Hospital in Barangay Biasong, Dipolog was opened to the public.
* On December 10, 2015, the &quot;Republic Act No. 10716&quot;, which renamed Batasan Hills High School (BHES) into &quot;President Corazon C. Aquino Elementary School&quot; (PCCAES) in Batasan Hills, Quezon City, was signed into law by President Benigno Aquino III.
* On June 29, 2018, the &quot;Republic Act No. 11045&quot;, which renamed the Kay Tikling-Antipolo-Teresa-Morong National Road to Corazon C. Aquino Avenue, was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte. Corazon C. Aquino Avenue is a road traversing from Taytay to Morong in Rizal (including the segment of Ortigas Avenue Extension from Taytay to Antipolo).

<doc id="279609" wikidata="Q6606000" url="?curid=279609" title="History of anime in the United States">
<text>The history of anime in the United States began in 1961, when &quot;Magic Boy&quot; and &quot;The White Snake Enchantress&quot;, both produced by Toei Animation, became the first two anime films to receive documented releases in the country. Anime has since found success with a growing audience in the region, with &quot;Astro Boy&quot; often being noted as the first anime to receive widespread syndication, especially in the United States. Although a handful titles were translated before 1970, such as Speed Racer and Eight Man (released as Tobor the Eight Man in the US) anime wouldn&#x27;t regrow into popularity in the US until the 1990s, commonly referred to as the &quot;anime boom,&quot; is credited with much of anime&#x27;s enduring relevance to popular culture outside Japan.

While several anime series have originally been distributed by pirates and fansubbers in the past via bootleg releases from the late-1990s to mid-2000s, such practices have rapidly declined since the early-2010s due to the advent of legal streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video, Hidive and Crunchyroll, which simulcast new anime series often within a few hours of their domestic release.

== Pre-1980s ==
After the first introduction of Astro Boy in 1963 in Japan, and later that year in the U.S. Many anime titles would receive dubbed into English during the 1960s, often broadcast on syndication or sometimes as Saturday morning cartoons, due to the quickly growing popularity of animation on US television screens. In January 1966, Tetsujin 28-go, renamed &quot;Gigantor&quot;, debuted on New York&#x27;s WPIX-TV. it had mixed reception, with reviewers such as Variety magazine giving it a menacing review, with writers calling it a &quot;loud, violent, tasteless and cheerless cartoon&quot; which was &quot;strictly in the retarded babysitter class&quot;. American International Television Productions released an English dub of Prince Planet around September 1966, however, it lacked popularity due to the growing popularity of color television and excessive violence. The same dubbing studio had also worked on The Amazing 3 in 1967, which was broadcast on KCOP-TV in Los Angeles.

Later in 1967, Speed Racer would be dubbed by Trans-Lux Corporation on syndication, becoming very popular, and would be one of the most popular anime in the U.S. until the 1990s. After the release of Marine Boy in 1969, there would be no new anime titles released in America until 1978.

Due to the extreme popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1977, In 1978, Sandy Frank Entertainment released an Americanized version of &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot;, to capitalize on the space craze caused by &quot;Star Wars&quot;, retitling the show as &quot;Battle of the Planets.&quot; 85 of the original 105 episodes made the US revised version, along with cuts of elements of graphic violence and profanity. The show reached a high level of success, airing on over 100 network affiliates during after-school hours by 1979. That same year, &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; would also receive an Americanized version, rebranded as &quot;Star Blazers.&quot; 

==1980s==

Basic cable provided a frequent broadcast outlet for juvenile-targeted anime during the 1980s, in particular Nickelodeon and CBN Cable Network (now as Freeform).

In the early 1980s, CBN aired an English dub of the Christian-themed anime series &quot;Superbook&quot; and &quot;The Flying House&quot;, as well as the female-aimed drama series &quot;Honey Honey&quot; and an uncut, Honolulu-dubbed version of Go Nagai&#x27;s super robot series &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; (aired as part of a Japan-focused, public-affairs program). In the late 1980s, after the station had been renamed as &quot;The Family Channel&quot;, it would also air dubs of &quot;Wowser&quot; and Nippon Animation&#x27;s World Masterpiece Theater version of &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;.

Nickelodeon aired anime such as &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot; and &quot;Belle and Sebastian&quot;, and anime also later formed a major component of the network&#x27;s preschool-aimed Nick Jr. block, including &quot;Maple Town&quot;, &quot;Adventures of the Little Koala&quot;, &quot;Noozles&quot;, &quot;Maya the Bee&quot;, &quot;The Littl&#x27; Bits&quot;, and &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tale Classics&quot;. Pay-TV channels also aired anime occasionally: HBO broadcast numerous anime television series based on Western literature, including Gisaburō Sugii&#x27;s &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; and the World Masterpiece Theater versions of &quot;Little Women&quot; and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, and Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Unico&quot; features aired on the Disney Channel.

In 1981, Roger Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures oversaw the production of an English dub of the first Galaxy Express movie &quot;Bonjour Galaxy Express 999&quot;, shortened the name to &quot;Galaxy Express&quot;, distributed it theatrically. The dub changed some of the original Japanese names into more recognizable American names, like changing Tetsuro to Joey and Harlock to Warlock. Corman also edited out 30 minutes of footage, and Antonia Levi, the author of &quot;Samurai from Outer Space&quot;, said that his dub was &quot;highly edited and too damaged to watch&quot;. Faring similarly poorly was Manson International&#x27;s 1984 edit of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, released theatrically by New World as &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;; a mainstay on HBO during the mid-to-late 1980s, this edited version is said to have so displeased Miyazaki that he would insist that all future American releases of his work be unedited.

In 1983, Stern Electronics released a &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; clone known as &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot;, which contained footage from the &quot;Lupin III&quot; films &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of Mamo&quot;. As &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot; predated any proper Western release of &quot;Lupin&quot; media or Hayao Miyazaki films, and the popularization of anime in the West generally, it became notable for first exposing many Americans to anime.

In the mid-1980s, super robot and space opera anime were very popular. Series such as &quot;Voltron&quot;, &quot;The Transformers&quot;, and &quot;Robotech&quot; were successful in ratings and also commercial successes through selling merchandise. &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; fared less well, airing in syndication in 1985 in a heavily edited and dubbed version (not the Toei-commissioned dub previously broadcast on CBN) titled &quot;TranZor Z.&quot; Faring even worse was the first American release of Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in 1989. Harmony Gold produced a partial dub of the first five TV episodes and two movies (&quot;The Curse of the Blood Rubies&quot; and &quot;The Mystical Adventure&quot;), which were edited into an 80-minute film. The dubs were syndicated across America to independent television stations such as WPSG Philly 57 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and WGPR-TV in Detroit, Michigan, but failed to find an audience.

Between 1988 and 1989, the OVA series &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; was one of the earliest fansubs, with AnimEigo later acquiring a license to distribute and dub the series.

In 1988, Streamline Pictures became one of the first companies dedicated solely to anime dubs, most notably dubbed versions of &quot;Twilight of the Cockroaches&quot; and three more Miyazaki films: &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, both released initially as in-flight entertainment for Japan Airlines passengers traveling from North America to Japan, and &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Totoro&quot; dub would eventually be released theatrically and commercially in the United States in 1993, and all three movies would later be redubbed by the Walt Disney Company as part of the company&#x27;s deal with Studio Ghibli.

&quot;Lensman: Secret of The Lens&quot;, based on the &quot;Lensman&quot; novels by E. E. Smith, was first dubbed by Harmony Gold in 1988, and re-dubbed by Streamline Pictures in 1990; some of the voice actors voiced characters in both dubs. The Harmony Gold dub used remastered music and some music tracks came from their past movies &quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot; and &quot;Robotech The Movie: The Untold Story&quot;, while the Streamline Pictures dub used the original Japanese soundtrack.

In 1988, AnimEigo begun distributing more anime after Streamline Pictures, with the slogan &quot;Anime in your way!&quot;. Their first anime they dubbed was &quot;Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01&quot;; renamed &quot;MADOX-01&quot; for the British release in 1995, it was only released on VHS in 1989, due to content not suitable for television or theatrical release. The company also dubbed the 4-episode OVA &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot; that same year, which was later adapted into a 26-episode TV series by Tokyopop (and later by Maiden Japan in 1997).

In the mid- to late 1980s, anime films such as &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, and &quot;MADOX-01&quot; were dubbed by companies including MGM, Fox, New World Pictures, and AnimEigo. Even though these films were not very successful at the time, due in part to limited release, critical reception was positive, and &quot;Akira&quot; found a cult following. Most of these films received higher-quality dubs later on.

==1990s==
The 1990s was the period in which anime reached mainstream popularity in the U.S. market and the terms &quot;anime&quot; and &quot;manga&quot; became commonly known, replacing &quot;Japanimation&quot;. Companies such as Funimation Productions, Bandai Entertainment, 4Kids Entertainment, Central Park Media, Media Blasters, Saban Entertainment, Viz Media, Pioneer LDC, and ADV Films began licensing anime in the United States.

The first anime in the US in the 1990s, &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; (also known as &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;), created by Akira Toriyama and based on the video game series, aired in 1989 in Japan; in 1990, it was broadcast in the US by Saban. The show was unsuccessful in the US and was not released on home video. Saban later dubbed and adapted the 1990 anime &quot;Kyatto Ninden Teyandee&quot; as &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats&quot; and aired it in syndication in 1996. In 2002, Saban&#x27;s rights to the show expired, after which Discotek Media obtained the rights (which it still owns currently).

Viz Media, which was already successful with its manga translation of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s &quot;Ranma ½&quot;, bought the rights to the anime and released it via direct-to-video starting in 1993. &quot;Ranma ½&quot; enjoyed success in the VHS market, being the first anime title in the 1990s to have this level of success, and was one of the first titles to be recognized as an &quot;anime&quot;. Viz also began publishing a magazine called &quot;Animerica&quot; in the 1990s, which featured manga as well as articles on Japanese culture, aesthetic, manga, anime, and video games; this helped spread the &quot;otaku&quot; subculture to Americans. Fansubs were also popular during this period.

In 1995, the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, now assisted by Funimation and other collaborators, finally managed to air to an American audience for one season in early morning syndication. The show was cancelled after one season due to low ratings.

Anime saw greater success among American audiences when DiC (then owned by Disney) and Funimation (via Saban Entertainment and Canada-based Ocean Studios) licensed &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (1995) and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; (1996) respectively, and both were televised in the U.S. through early morning syndication. Since the two anime were very successful internationally, they were purchased to capitalize on the success of Japan-influenced superhero shows such as Fox Kids&#x27; &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; (the popular Americanized version of the tokusatsu series &quot;Super Sentai&quot;) and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;.

In Summer 1998, Cartoon Network, which had an action-themed evening block named Toonami, began airing &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. Both became overpoweringly successful with younger audiences (due to being aired in the evening hours which children were home). As a result, both series were revived, receiving new dubs with significantly less editing amid the recent inception of the TV Parental Guidelines (both were rated TV-Y7-FV). &quot;Voltron&quot;, &quot;Robotech&quot; and &quot;Ronin Warriors&quot; also enjoyed renewed success on Toonami. Toonami would continue to air anime and is credited with beginning the anime boom in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In 1996, one of the most influential and controversial popular series was &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. It was released uncut on VHS by ADV Films, and Manga Entertainment released the films &quot;End of Evangelion&quot; and &quot;Evangelion: Death and Rebirth&quot; in the U.S. in 2002. &quot;Evangelion&quot; grew to have a large fanbase in the United States.

In 1998, &quot;Pokémon&quot; was introduced to America because of The WB (now as CW), becoming a commercial success through its merchandising (trading cards, VHS, toys, video games, etc.). &quot;Digimon&quot; was introduced in 1999; although it was a success, it did not reach the same level of popularity as &quot;Pokémon&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, Syfy (formerly Sci-Fi Channel) also aired many experimental, avant-garde, action, horror, and sci-fi anime films and series during the late night and early morning hours until their removal from programming in 2011. It aired films including &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, and &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot;, and series such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;. In Northern California, KTEH-TV in San Jose became well known locally for being one of the few PBS outlets to air anime, in both dubbed and subtitled versions.

In 1999, Disney&#x27;s Miramax released the anime film &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; in the U.S. theatrically. Although it was not a great success at the box office, performing much better on DVD releases, it began the relationship between Disney and Studio Ghibli to distribute the latter&#x27;s films in the U.S.

==2000s==

In the 2000s, even after the popular series &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; ended their runs, Toonami still continued to air popular anime such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot; (which is credited for single-handedly popularizing the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise in some Western countries), &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;,&quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot;, &quot;.hack&quot;, &quot;Cardcaptors&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot; (and &quot;Tenchi in Tokyo&quot;), &quot;The 08th MS Team&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, &quot;SD Gundam&quot;, &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;, &quot;IGPX&quot;, &quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot;, &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, &quot;Hamtaro&quot;, and &quot;Naruto&quot;. &quot;Naruto&quot; was very successful on Toonami and remains one of the most popular anime titles in the U.S. In 2008, Toonami was discontinued and anime began airing exclusively on Adult Swim, the late-night counterpart to Cartoon Network.

When Adult Swim began airing on Cartoon Network in 2001, its first anime title aired was &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; was very successful and remains the longest aired anime series on Adult Swim. Adult Swim also aired series including uncut episodes of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;, &quot;Death Note&quot;, &quot;Durarara!!&quot;, &quot;FLCL&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Case Closed&quot;, &quot;Lupin III&quot;, &quot;Code Geass&quot;, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;Shin Chan&quot;, and &quot;Trigun&quot;. Adult Swim mostly airs anime under the title &quot;Action&quot;, even though &quot;Shin Chan&quot; and &quot;Super Milk Chan&quot; are comedies. Adult Swim became so successful over the years that Turner Broadcasting split it from Cartoon Network; it is now ranked as an independent network.

Due to the popularity of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, Funimation would continue to dominate anime distribution in the United States and continued licensing several popular titles such as &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;, &quot;Black Cat&quot;, &quot;Ouran High School Host Club&quot;, &quot;Kodocha&quot;, &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, and launched its own Funimation Channel to exclusively air most of its titles. Funimation would also save rights to titles from defunct licensors, such as with ADV Films (which closed in 2008) and Geneon (which closed in 2007).

After the success of &quot;Pokémon&quot; in the late 1990s, 4Kids Entertainment continued to license anime titles targeted towards children, such as the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise, &quot;Sonic X&quot;, &quot;Magical DoReMi&quot;, &quot;Mew Mew Power&quot;, &quot;Shaman King&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur King&quot;, and &quot;Ultimate Muscle&quot;. However, 4Kids was met with much controversy for its heavy editing and &quot;Americanization&quot; of content, particularly &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; was released through Disney theatrically, becoming the first anime film to be nominated for and win an Oscar.

==2010s==

In 2010, &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot; premiered on Nicktoons (sister channel of the first kids&#x27; network) and became a hit success for the network. Nicktoons also aired the original &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; films and &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. Starting in March 2013, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; and one of its continuing series, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal&quot;, began to air on the network. &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; and &quot;Digimon Adventure 02&quot; also started to air on Nicktoons starting in June 2013, and one of its continuing series, &quot;Digimon Fusion&quot;, moved to the network from Nickelodeon on October 13, 2013 after three episodes, mostly due to Nickelodeon&#x27;s failed attempt at marketing the anime before it premiered on September 7.

Section23, Bandai, Viz, TV Tokyo, and Funimation have tried to limit these efforts by sending cease and desist letters or blocking content on many sites. The production of English dubs of anime has decreased in general, and many distributors, such as Sentai Filmworks, Aniplex of America, and NIS America, are switching to the subtitle-only market.

In 2012, Bandai folded its Bandai Entertainment anime licensing department in the United States. Eventually, their Sunrise studio made deals with Funimation and Sentai Filmworks to license and republish Sunrise titles formerly licensed by Bandai Entertainment. In 2012, 4Kids Entertainment filed for bankruptcy protection and sold the rights to the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise back to Konami, with the remaining licenses going to Saban Brands.

In early 2012, &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos&quot; was released in over 100 theaters throughout North America. &quot;The Secret World of Arrietty&quot; was released theatrically in 2012, and was only a moderate box office success in the United States, despite being one of the highest-grossing films in the U.S. in 2012 (and #50 worldwide).

In 2012, due to popular requests on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, the Toonami block was revived and began airing on Adult Swim, replacing Adult Swim Action. Similar to Toonami&#x27;s prior Midnight Run block, it is now targeted towards a young adult demographic with little to no editing of content. On May 16, 2014, Viz Media acquired the license for the original &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series (formerly owned by DiC (now part of WildBrain) and Cloverway Inc. in the 1990s and early 2000s) and the new 2014 anime series, &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Crystal&quot;, which it premiered on July 5. In May 2014, The Walt Disney Company acquired the broadcasting rights for the 2005 &quot;Doraemon&quot; series and began airing it on Disney XD two months later, marking the first-ever release of the &quot;Doraemon&quot; franchise in the United States after not airing many years later because of Turner&#x27;s failure.

In December 2015, the Funimation Channel was replaced by Toku, after Funimation finished its association with Olympusat, being the only 24-hour TV channel dedicated to broadcasting anime series and films, as well as live-action Asian films.

==2020s==
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many anime works have either been delayed or canceled until further notice.

Despite this, anime consumption and appreciation in the United States has grown tremendously in the 2020s. This is largely due to the nationwide lockdown during the pandemic, and popularity of anime edits and fan discourse on the social media app TikTok. This exposed a whole new wave of American fans to Japanese anime, namely &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;, &quot;Death Note&quot;, &quot;Hunter x Hunter&quot;, &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, and &quot;Haikyuu!&quot;. This newfound interest and demand for anime content has only increased among audiences, as of 2024.

In the years since 2020, there have been several US theatrical releases of new Japanese animated films, and even limited-time re-releases of popular films such as &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; and a variety of Ghibli films screened nationwide during Ghiblifest.

Netflix has also adapted an expanding number of live-action series based on Japanese anime IP. Their most successful adaptions thus far have been &quot;One Piece&quot; (2024) and &quot;Alice in Borderland&quot; (2020).

<text>Benigno Simeón &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr., (, ; November 27, 1932 – August 21, 1983) was a Filipino politician who served as a senator of the Philippines (1967–1972) and governor of the province of Tarlac. Aquino was the husband of Corazon Aquino, who became the 11th president of the Philippines after his assassination, and father of Benigno Aquino III, who became the 15th president of the Philippines. Aquino, together with Gerardo Roxas and Jovito Salonga, helped form the leadership of the opposition toward then President Ferdinand Marcos. He was the significant leader who together with the intellectual leader Sen. Jose W. Diokno led the overall opposition.

Early in his Senate career, Aquino vigorously attempted to investigate the Jabidah massacre in March 1968. Shortly after the imposition of martial law in 1972, Aquino was arrested along with other members of the opposition. He was incarcerated for seven years. He has been described as Marcos&#x27; &quot;most famous political prisoner&quot;. He founded his own party, Lakas ng Bayan and ran in the 1978 Philippine parliamentary election, but all the party&#x27;s candidates lost in the election. In 1980, he was permitted by Marcos and his wife Imelda to travel to the United States for medical treatment following a heart attack. During the early 1980s, he became one of the most notable critics of the Marcos regime, and enjoyed popularity across the US due to the numerous rallies he attended at the time.

As the situation in the Philippines worsened, Aquino decided to return to face Marcos and restore democracy in the country, despite numerous threats against him. He was assassinated at the Manila International Airport on August 21, 1983, upon returning from his self-imposed exile. His death revitalized opposition to Marcos; it also catapulted his widow, Corazon, into the political limelight and prompted her to successfully run for a six-year term as president as a member of the United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO) party in the 1986 snap election.

Among other public structures, Manila International Airport has since been renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport in his honor, and the anniversary of his death is a national holiday. Aquino has also been listed as a Motu Proprio human rights violations victim of the Martial Law era.

==Early life and career==
Benigno Simeón Aquino Jr. was born in Concepcion, Tarlac on November 27, 1932, to Benigno Aquino Sr., who was then a senator from the 3rd district and Senate majority leader, and Aurora (née Aquino) Aquino from a prosperous family of &quot;hacienderos&quot;, the original owners of Hacienda Tinang.

His grandfather, Servillano Aquino, was a general in the revolutionary army of Emilio Aguinaldo, the officially recognized first President of the Philippines.

He received his elementary education at the basic education department of De La Salle College and finished at the basic education department of Saint Joseph&#x27;s College of Quezon City. He then graduated at the high school department of San Beda College. Aquino took his tertiary education at Ateneo de Manila University to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree, but he interrupted his studies. According to one of his biographies, he considered himself to be an average student; his grade was not in the line of 90s nor did it fall into the 70s. At the age of 17, he was the youngest war correspondent to cover the Korean War for &quot;The Manila Times&quot; of &quot;Don&quot; Joaquín &quot;Chino&quot; Roces. Because of his journalistic feats, he received the Philippine Legion of Honor award from President Elpidio Quirino when aged 18. At 21, he became a close adviser to then Defense Secretary Ramon Magsaysay. Aquino took up law at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he became a member of Upsilon Sigma Phi, the same fraternity as Ferdinand Marcos. He interrupted his studies again however to pursue a career in journalism. According to Máximo Soliven, Aquino &quot;later &#x27;explained&#x27; that he had decided to go to as many schools as possible, so that he could make as many new friends as possible.&quot; In early 1954, he was appointed by President Ramon Magsaysay, his wedding sponsor to his 1953 wedding at the Our Lady of Sorrows Church in Pasay with Corazon Cojuangco, to act as personal emissary to Luis Taruc, leader of the Hukbalahap rebel group. After four months of negotiations, he was credited for Taruc&#x27;s unconditional surrender and was given a second Philippine Legion of Honor award with the degree of Commander on October 14, 1954.

==Political career==
Aquino gained an early familiarity with Philippine politics, as he was born into one of the Philippines&#x27; political and landholding clans. His grandfather served under President Aguinaldo, and his father held office under Presidents Quezon and Jose P. Laurel. As a consequence, he became mayor of Concepcion in 1955 at the age of 23. Five years later, he was elected the nation&#x27;s youngest vice governor at 27 (the record was later surpassed by Bongbong Marcos at 22 in 1980). Two years later, he became governor of Tarlac province in 1961 and then secretary-general of the Liberal Party in 1966.

In 1968, during his first year as senator, Aquino alleged that Marcos was on the road to establishing &quot;a garrison state&quot; by &quot;ballooning the armed forces budget,&quot; saddling the defense establishment with &quot;overstaying generals&quot; and &quot;militarizing our civilian government offices.&quot;

Aquino became known as a constant critic of the Marcos regime, as his flamboyant rhetoric had made him a darling of the media. His most polemical speech, &quot;A Pantheon for Imelda&quot;, was delivered on February 10, 1969. He assailed the Cultural Center, the first project of First Lady Imelda Marcos as extravagant, and dubbed it &quot;a monument to shame&quot; and labelled its designer &quot;a megalomaniac, with a penchant to captivate&quot;. By the end of the day, the country&#x27;s broadsheets had blared that he labelled the President&#x27;s wife, his cousin Paz&#x27;s former ward, and a woman he had once courted, &quot;the Philippines&#x27; Eva Peron&quot;. President Marcos is said to have been outraged and labelled Aquino &quot;a congenital liar&quot;. The First Lady&#x27;s friends angrily accused Aquino of being &quot;ungallant&quot;. These so-called &quot;fiscalization&quot; tactics of Aquino quickly became his trademark in the Senate.

It was not until the Plaza Miranda bombing on August 21, 1971, that the pattern of direct confrontation between Marcos and Aquino emerged. At 9:15 pm, at the kick-off rally of the Liberal Party, the candidates formed a line on a makeshift platform and were raising their hands as the crowd applauded. The band played, a fireworks display drew all eyes, when suddenly two loud explosions obviously were not part of the show. In an instant, the stage became a scene of wild carnage. The police later discovered two fragmentation grenades that had been thrown at the stage by &quot;unknown persons&quot;. Eight people died, and 120 others were wounded, many critically.

Aquino, elected senator in 1967, was not a candidate in the 1971 midterm election hence was not in Plaza Miranda, but his absence caused some to assume that Aquino&#x27;s friends in the New People&#x27;s Army (NPA) tipped him off in advance. Unnamed sources accused Aquino of being involved. No one has ever been prosecuted for the attack. Many historians continue to suspect Marcos as the culprit behind the incident, as he is known to have used false flag attacks as a pretext for his declaration of martial law at that time. Historian Joseph Scalice, however, has argued that while the Marcos government was allied with the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) in carrying out bombings in the early 1970s, &quot;the evidence of history now overwhelmingly suggests that the Communist Party of the Philippines, despite being allied with the Liberal Party, was responsible for this bombing, seeing it as a means of facilitating repression which they argued would hasten revolution.&quot;

==Early martial law years==
Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972, through Proclamation No. 1081 and went on air to broadcast his declaration on the midnight of September 23. Aquino and Sen. Diokno were two of the first to be arrested, and were imprisoned in Fort Bonifacio on trumped-up charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion. Aquino was tried before Military Commission No. 2, headed by Major-General Jose Syjuco and moved to the Codenamed &quot;Alpha&quot; Room at Fort Magsaysay in Laur, Nueva Ecija.

On April 4, 1975, Aquino announced that he was going on a hunger strike, a fast to the death to protest the injustices of his military trial. Ten days through his hunger strike, he instructed his lawyers to withdraw all the motions he had submitted to the Supreme Court. As weeks went by, he subsisted solely on salt tablets, sodium bicarbonate, amino acids and two glasses of water a day. Even as he grew weaker, suffering from chills and cramps, soldiers forcibly dragged him to the military tribunal&#x27;s session. His family and hundreds of friends and supporters heard Mass nightly at the Santuario de San Jose in Greenhills, San Juan, praying for his survival. Near the end, Aquino&#x27;s weight dropped from 54 to 36 kilograms. Aquino nonetheless was able to walk throughout his ordeal. On May 13, 1975, on the 40th day, his family and several priests and friends, begged him to end his fast, pointing out that even Christ fasted only for 40 days. He acquiesced, confident that he had made a symbolic gesture.

He, however, remained in prison, and the trial continued, drawn out for several years. Throughout the trial, Aquino said that the military tribunal had no authority over his and his co-accused cases. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission found Aquino, along with NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (&quot;Kumander Dante&quot;) and Lt. Victor Corpus, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad. Marcos commuted their death sentence due to international pressure over his government&#x27;s human rights record.

==1978 election, bypass surgery==

In 1978, from his prison cell, Aquino was allowed to run in the 1978 Philippine parliamentary election. As Ninoy&#x27;s Liberal Party colleagues were boycotting the election, he formed the &quot;Lakas ng Bayan,&quot; an umbrella coalition of opposition parties and individuals. The party had 21 candidates for the Region VI-A (Metro Manila) area, including Ninoy himself. While initially agreeing to the boycott due to &quot;&quot;the government already [having] the forces in its command and the entire machinery of politics which [they] do not have,&quot; Aquino later changed his mind and opted to take part in the elections to have the chance to &quot;talk to the people,&quot;&quot; having been imprisoned for almost six years at that point.

On March 10, 1978, he was entitled to one television interview on GTV&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; hosted by Ronnie Nathanielsz with panelists Enrique Romualdez of the Daily Express, Reynaldo Naval of the Times Journal and Teddy Owen of Bulletin Today. The interview proved to a startled and impressed populace that imprisonment had neither dulled his &quot;rapier-like tongue&quot; nor dampened his fighting spirit. According to Aquino, he wanted to give the people a vehicle to express their frustration or their anger and to serve as a fiscalizer in the Interim Batasang Pambansa. He further justified his candidacy in Metro Manila instead of his home province of Tarlac as to submerge his popularity, with a victory meaning that the opposition of win, instead of himself just winning. However, all of the party&#x27;s candidates lost the election, with Aquino being the best-performing opposition candidate, ranking 22nd in the 21-seat at-large contest.

In mid-March 1980, Aquino suffered a heart attack, mostly in a solitary cell. He was transported to the Philippine Heart Center, where he suffered a second heart attack. ECG and other tests showed that he had a blocked artery. Philippine surgeons were reluctant to do a coronary bypass, because it could involve them in a controversy. In addition, Aquino refused to submit himself to Philippine doctors, fearing possible Marcos &quot;duplicity&quot;; he preferred to go to the United States for the procedure or return to his cell at Fort Bonifacio and die.

His request was granted and Ninoy was allowed to go to the United States for surgery, together with his entire family. This was arranged after a secret hospital visit by Imelda Marcos. This &quot;emergency leave&quot; was set up when Ninoy supposedly agreed to the conditions that, first, he will return, and second, he will not speak out against Marcos in the US. Ninoy was operated on by Rolando M. Solis, a Filipino American and the longest-practicing cardiologist in Dallas, Texas, where the operation took place. After the surgery, Ninoy made a quick recovery, after which he decided to renounce the agreement, saying, &quot;a pact with the devil is no pact at all&quot;.

He, Cory and their children started a new life in Massachusetts. He continued to work on two books and gave a series of lectures while on fellowship grants from Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His travels across the US had become opportunities for him to deliver speeches critical of the Marcos government, going as far as Damascus in order to meet with Muslims and the MNLF in order to mediate in the Moro conflict. Throughout his years of expatriation, Aquino was always aware that his life in the U.S. was temporary. He never stopped affirming his eventual return even as he enjoyed American hospitality and a peaceful life with his family on American soil. After spending seven years and seven months in prison, Aquino&#x27;s finances were in ruins. Making up for the lost time as the family&#x27;s breadwinner, he toured America; attending symposiums, lectures, and giving speeches in freedom rallies opposing the Marcos government. The most memorable was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles, California on February 15, 1981.

==Planned return to the Philippines==

In the first quarter of 1983, Aquino received news about the deteriorating political situation in his country and the rumored declining health of President Marcos (due to lupus). He believed that it was expedient for him to speak to Marcos and present to him his rationale for the country&#x27;s return to democracy, before extremists took over and made such a change impossible. Moreover, his years of absence made his allies worry that the Filipinos might have resigned themselves to Marcos&#x27; strongman rule and that without his leadership the centrist opposition would die a natural death.

Aquino decided to go back to the Philippines, fully aware of the dangers that awaited him. Warned that he would either be imprisoned or killed, Aquino answered, &quot;if it&#x27;s my fate to die by an assassin&#x27;s bullet, so be it. But I cannot be petrified by inaction, or fear of assassination, and therefore stay in the side...&quot; His family, however, learned from a Philippine Consular official that there were orders from Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to issue any passports for them. At that time, their passports had expired and their renewal had been denied. They therefore formulated a plan for Aquino to fly alone (to attract less attention), with the rest of the family to follow him after two weeks. Despite the government&#x27;s ban on issuing him a passport, Aquino acquired one with the help of Rashid Lucman, a former Mindanao legislator and founder of the Bangsamoro Liberation Front, a Moro separatist group against Marcos. It carried the alias &quot;Marcial Bonifacio&quot; (Marcial for martial law and Bonifacio for Fort Bonifacio, his erstwhile prison). He eventually obtained a legitimate passport from a sympathizer working in a Philippine consulate through the help of Roque Ablan Jr., who was then a congressman for Ilocos Norte. The Marcos government warned all international airlines that they would be denied landing rights and forced to return if they tried to fly Aquino back to the Philippines. Aquino insisted that it was his natural right as a citizen to come back to his homeland, and that no government could prevent him from doing so. He left Logan International Airport on August 13, 1983, took a circuitous route home from Boston, via Los Angeles, to Singapore. In Singapore, then-Tunku Ibrahim Ismail of Johor met Aquino upon his arrival and later brought him to Johor, Malaysia to meet with other Malaysian leaders. Once in Johor, Aquino met up with Tunku Ibrahim&#x27;s father, Sultan Iskandar, who was a close friend to Aquino.

He then left for Hong Kong and on to Taipei. He had chosen Taipei as the final stopover when he learned the Philippines had severed diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan). This made him feel more secure; the Taiwan government could pretend they were not aware of his presence. There would also be a couple of Taiwanese friends accompanying him. From Taipei, he flew to Manila on then Taiwan&#x27;s flag carrier China Airlines Flight 811.

Marcos wanted Aquino to stay out of politics. However, Aquino asserted his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, &quot;the Filipino is worth dying for.&quot; He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that &quot;it&#x27;s only good for the body, but in the head there&#x27;s nothing else we can do.&quot; Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, &quot;You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [laughing] I may not be able to talk to you again after this.&quot; His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.

In his last formal statement that he was not able to deliver, he said, &quot;I have returned on my free will to join the ranks of those struggling to restore our rights and freedoms through non-violence. I seek no confrontation.&quot;

==Assassination and aftermath==


Aquino was shot in the head after returning to the Philippines in the early afternoon on August 21, 1983. About 1,000 security personnel had been assigned by the Marcos government to ensure Aquino&#x27;s safe return to his detention cell in Fort Bonifacio, but this did not prevent the assassination. Another man present at the airport tarmac, Rolando Galman, was shot dead shortly after Aquino was killed. The Marcos government falsely claimed that Galman was the trigger man in Aquino&#x27;s assassination.

An investigation headed by Justice Corazon Agrava led to murder charges being filed against twenty-five military men and one civilian. They were acquitted by the Sandiganbayan on December 2, 1985, in what the Supreme Court would later describe as a &quot;mock trial&quot; ordered by &quot;the authoritarian president&quot; himself.

After Marcos&#x27; government was overthrown, another investigation found sixteen soldiers guilty. They were sentenced in 1990 by the Sandiganbayan to life in prison, a decision affirmed by the Supreme Court. Some were released over the years, the last ones in March 2009.

After the assassination, the opposition ran for the Regular Batasang Pambansa under the United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO) and the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan (PDP–Laban) against the ruling Kilusang Bagong Lipunan of Ferdinand Marcos. In the wake of the massive outpouring of protest and discontent following the assassination of Aquino, the opposition performed better during the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election compared to the 1978 Philippine parliamentary election, winning 61 seats out of 183 seats, or 33% of the total number of seats.

==Funeral==
Hours after the assassination, Aquino&#x27;s remains were autopsied at Loyola Memorial Chapels in Makati. Aquino&#x27;s wife, Cory, was still in Boston when she was informed of the assassination through telephone by Japanese congressman and family friend Shintaro Ishihara. On the following day, his remains lay in state at the Aquino household in Times Street, Quezon City for several days, with his clothes unchanged, and no effort was made to disguise a bullet wound that had disfigured his face. His remains were also transferred to the Santo Domingo Church during that period. In an interview with Aquino&#x27;s mother, Aurora, she told the funeral parlor not to apply makeup nor embalm her son, to show &quot;what they did to my son&quot;. Aquino&#x27;s wife, Cory, and children Ballsy, Pinky, Viel, Noynoy, and Kris arrived in the Philippines on August 23. His remains were later brought to Tarlac on August 29 for a funeral in Concepcion and at the Hacienda Luisita Chapel. Thousands of supporters flocked to see the bloodied body of Aquino.

Aquino&#x27;s remains were returned to Metro Manila for a final funeral procession on August 31. It lasted from 9 a.m., when his funeral mass was held at Santo Domingo Church, with the Cardinal Archbishop of Manila, Jaime Sin officiating, to 9 p.m., when his body was interred at the Manila Memorial Park in Parañaque. More than two million people lined the streets for the procession. Some stations like the church-sponsored Radio Veritas and DZRH were the only stations to cover the entire ceremony.

Jovito Salonga, then head of the Liberal Party, referred to Aquino as &quot;the greatest president we never had&quot;, adding:
Ninoy was getting impatient in Boston, he felt isolated by the flow of events in the Philippines. In early 1983, Marcos was seriously ailing, the Philippine economy was just as rapidly declining, and insurgency was becoming a serious problem. Ninoy thought that by coming home he might be able to persuade Marcos to restore democracy and somehow revitalize the Liberal Party.

==Historical reputation and legacy==

Although Aquino was recognized as the most prominent and dynamic politician of his generation, in the years prior to martial law, many regarded him as a representative of the entrenched familial elite which to this day dominates Philippine politics. Telegenic and articulate, Aquino had his share of detractors and was not known to be immune to the ambitions and excesses of the ruling political class. However, during his seven years and seven months imprisoned as a criminal, Aquino read the book &quot;Born Again&quot; by convicted Watergate conspirator Charles Colson and it inspired him to a rude awakening.

As a result, the remainder of his personal and political life had a distinct spiritual sheen. He emerged as a contemporary counterpart of Jose Rizal, who was among the most vocal proponents of the use of non-violence to combat a repressive regime at the time, following the model of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.

Some oppositionist students who were active in the fight against the Marcos administration, including now-opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros, recount that at the time they had originally thought of Aquino as just another &quot;traditional politician,&quot; but began to acknowledge he was more than that when he took the risk of returning to the Philippines, and ultimately paid for his choice with his life.

=== Monuments and memorials ===
Manila International Airport (MIA), where he was assassinated, was renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in 1987. Several schools, roads, and establishments, including the Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center, were also named after him. His image was printed on the New Design/BSP Series 500-peso note. With said series being demonetized starting 2013, his wife is now also featured along him on the New Generation Currency Series.

On February 25, 2004, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed into law Republic Act No. 9256 on the 21st anniversary of his death as an annual special non-working holiday in the Philippines.

Several monuments were built in their honor. One of which is the bronze memorial at the intersection of Paseo de Roxas and Ayala Avenue in Makati. Another bronze statue stands in front of the Municipal Building of Concepcion, Tarlac. Other monuments include those at the People Power Monument in Quezon City, along his namesake avenue in Parañaque, in Tarlac City, and two others in Manila ( at the Intramuros-side of Padre Burgos Avenue corner Roxas Boulevard, and around a kilometer down the aforementioned at Manila Baywalk opposite Pedro Gil Street (formerly Herran)).

Aquino was also among the first to be honored at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani, a monument dedicated to those who opposed the Marcos dictatorship, alongside fellow former senators Jose W. Diokno and Lorenzo Tañada.

The Ninoy Aquino Library and Learning Resources Center, the main university library of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, was also named in his honor.

In a June 1981 interview with Pat Robertson on &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, Aquino said he was raised Catholic. According to him, his religious awakening began after reading Evangelical Christian author Charles Colson&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;Born Again&quot;, during his solitary confinement under the Marcos regime.

=== In popular culture===
Aquino was prominently featured in the 1988 Australian miniseries &quot;A Dangerous Life&quot;. Aquino was portrayed by Amado Cortez in the 1994 film &quot;Mayor Cesar Climaco&quot;. Then-Senator Raul Roco, who was part of Aquino&#x27;s Senate legal staff, portrayed him for the 1997 film &quot;Ilaban Mo, Bayan Ko: The Obet Pagdanganan story&quot;. Then-Valenzuela Mayor Bobbit Carlos portrayed him in the 2003 biographical film &quot;Chavit: Blood Son of Ilocos&quot;. In 2005, director Carlo J. Caparas and his wife, producer Donna Villa, began plans to produce a film about Aquino&#x27;s assassination from the soldiers&#x27; point of view, while actor Cesar Montano intended to produce a film based on Aquino&#x27;s life starring himself, though both projects did not come to fruition. His nephew, former Senator Bam Aquino, portrayed him in the 2009 documentary film &quot;The Last Journey of Ninoy&quot;. He was also portrayed by Isko Moreno and Jerome Ponce in the 2022 film &quot;Martyr or Murderer&quot;, while in the same year JK Labajo portrayed him in the historical drama film &quot;Ako si Ninoy&quot;.

On television, Aquino was portrayed by Piolo Pascual on the two-part story of &quot;The Ninoy &amp; Cory Aquino Story&quot; on &quot;Maalaala Mo Kaya&quot; in 2010, in the episodes entitled &quot;Kalapati&quot; and &quot;Makinilya&quot;.

In theater, Aquino was portrayed by Conrad Ricamora in the Off-Broadway and Seattle productions of the musical &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;. Ricamora reprises his role in the 2023 Broadway transfer of the musical.

Aquino wrote a 19-stanza poem for his wife Cory Aquino while in detention in 1973, entitled &quot;I Have Fallen in Love with the Same Woman Three Times&quot;. The poem was made into a song by singer Jose Mari Chan and is included in his 1989 album &quot;Constant Change&quot;.

<text>In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own. One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting for someone at home might hear the door close, as if the one they&#x27;re waiting for arrived, or even see their shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that they haven&#x27;t arrived yet after all. When the person finally comes home, they would repeat the actions of their etiäinen that the people waiting witnessed earlier. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming.

In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to . Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can&#x27;t be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset may concern everyday events and aren&#x27;t necessarily too dramatic, although ones related to deaths aren&#x27;t uncommon either. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.

== Possible causes ==
One explanation given for the detail of the apparition is that when a person is waiting for someone, their anticipation can augment everyday sounds, for example of a cat or the wind, and bring to consciousness a vivid recollection of the person. This recollection will tend to produce the feeling that the remembered person is &quot;coming&quot;. If no one comes, the &quot;possible etiäinen&quot; is forgotten. The failure of this explanation is that etiäinen does not necessarily occur when you expect someone to come. It more often indicates an unexpected visitor who would otherwise come as a surprise, without phone calls or any kind of announcement beforehand.

<doc id="279624" wikidata="Q2265632" url="?curid=279624" title="Magnetic flux quantum">
<text>The magnetic flux, represented by the symbol , threading some contour or loop is defined as the magnetic field multiplied by the loop area , i.e. . Both and can be arbitrary, meaning that the flux can be as well but increments of flux can be quantized. The wave function can be multivalued as it happens in the Aharonov–Bohm effect or quantized as in superconductors. The unit of quantization is therefore called magnetic flux quantum.

== Dirac magnetic flux quantum ==
The first to realize the importance of the flux quantum was Dirac in his publication on monopoles

The phenomenon of flux quantization was predicted first by Fritz London then within the Aharonov–Bohm effect and later discovered experimentally in superconductors (see &quot;&quot; below).

== Superconducting magnetic flux quantum ==

If one deals with a superconducting ring (i.e. a closed loop path in a superconductor) or a hole in a bulk superconductor, the magnetic flux threading such a hole/loop is quantized. 

The (superconducting) magnetic flux quantum is a combination of fundamental physical constants: the Planck constant and the electron charge . 
Its value is, therefore, the same for any superconductor.

To understand this definition in the context of the Dirac flux quantum one shall consider that the effective quasiparticles active in a superconductors are Cooper pairs with an effective charge of 2 electrons .

The phenomenon of flux quantization was first discovered in superconductors experimentally by B. S. Deaver and W. M. Fairbank and, independently, by R. Doll and M. Näbauer, in 1961. The quantization of magnetic flux is closely related to the Little–Parks effect, but was predicted earlier by Fritz London in 1948 using a phenomenological model.

The inverse of the flux quantum, , is called the Josephson constant, and is denoted J. It is the constant of proportionality of the Josephson effect, relating the potential difference across a Josephson junction to the frequency of the irradiation. The Josephson effect is very widely used to provide a standard for high-precision measurements of potential difference, which (from 1990 to 2019) were related to a fixed, conventional value of the Josephson constant, denoted J-90. With the 2019 revision of the SI, the Josephson constant has an exact value of J = .

== Derivation of the superconducting flux quantum ==
The following physical equations use SI units. In CGS units, a factor of would appear.

The superconducting properties in each point of the superconductor are described by the &quot;complex&quot; quantum mechanical wave function – the superconducting order parameter. As any complex function can be written as , where is the amplitude and is the phase. Changing the phase by will not change and, correspondingly, will not change any physical properties. However, in the superconductor of non-trivial topology, e.g. superconductor with the hole or superconducting loop/cylinder, the phase may continuously change from some value to the value as one goes around the hole/loop and comes to the same starting point. If this is so, then one has magnetic flux quanta trapped in the hole/loop, as shown below:

Per minimal coupling, the current density of Cooper pairs in the superconductor is:
formula_1
where is the charge of the Cooper pair.
The wave function is the Ginzburg–Landau order parameter:
formula_2

Plugged into the expression of the current, one obtains:
formula_3

Inside the body of the superconductor, the current density J is zero, and therefore
formula_4

Integrating around the hole/loop using Stokes&#x27; theorem and gives:
formula_5

Now, because the order parameter must return to the same value when the integral goes back to the same point, we have:
formula_6

Due to the Meissner effect, the magnetic induction inside the superconductor is zero. More exactly, magnetic field penetrates into a superconductor over a small distance called London&#x27;s magnetic field penetration depth (denoted and usually ≈ 100 nm). The screening currents also flow in this -layer near the surface, creating magnetization inside the superconductor, which perfectly compensates the applied field , thus resulting in inside the superconductor.

The magnetic flux frozen in a loop/hole (plus its -layer) will always be quantized. However, the value of the flux quantum is equal to only when the path/trajectory around the hole described above can be chosen so that it lays in the superconducting region without screening currents, i.e. several away from the surface. There are geometries where this condition cannot be satisfied, e.g. a loop made of very thin () superconducting wire or the cylinder with the similar wall thickness. In the latter case, the flux has a quantum different from .

The flux quantization is a key idea behind a SQUID, which is one of the most sensitive magnetometers available.

Flux quantization also plays an important role in the physics of type II superconductors. When such a superconductor (now without any holes) is placed in a magnetic field with the strength between the first critical field and the second critical field , the field partially penetrates into the superconductor in a form of Abrikosov vortices. The Abrikosov vortex consists of a normal core – a cylinder of the normal (non-superconducting) phase with a diameter on the order of the , the superconducting coherence length. The normal core plays a role of a hole in the superconducting phase. The magnetic field lines pass along this normal core through the whole sample. The screening currents circulate in the -vicinity of the core and screen the rest of the superconductor from the magnetic field in the core. In total, each such Abrikosov vortex carries one quantum of magnetic flux .

== Measuring the magnetic flux ==
Prior to the 2019 revision of the SI, the magnetic flux quantum was measured with great precision by exploiting the Josephson effect. When coupled with the measurement of the von Klitzing constant , this provided the most accurate values of the Planck constant obtained until 2019. This may be counterintuitive, since is generally associated with the behaviour of microscopically small systems, whereas the quantization of magnetic flux in a superconductor and the quantum Hall effect are both emergent phenomena associated with thermodynamically large numbers of particles.

As a result of the 2019 revision of the SI, the Planck constant has a fixed value which, together with the definitions of the second and the metre, provides the official definition of the kilogram. Furthermore, the elementary charge also has a fixed value of to define the ampere. Therefore, both the Josephson constant and the von Klitzing constant have fixed values, and the Josephson effect along with the von Klitzing quantum Hall effect becomes the primary &quot;mise en pratique&quot; for the definition of the ampere and other electric units in the SI.

<doc id="279629" wikidata="Q212733" url="?curid=279629" title="Joseph Estrada">
<text>Joseph Ejercito Estrada (; born Jose Marcelo Ejercito; April 19, 1937), also known by the nickname Erap, is a Filipino politician and former actor, who served as the 13th President of the Philippines from 1998 until his removal in 2001, the 9th Vice President of the Philippines from 1992 to 1998, and the 22nd Mayor of Manila, the country&#x27;s capital from 2013 to 2019, also served as the 14th Mayor of San Juan from 1969 to 1986. In 2001, he became the first chief executive in Asia to be formally impeached. At the age of , he is currently the oldest living former Philippine president.

Estrada gained popularity as a film actor, playing the lead role in over a hundred films in an acting career spanning some three decades. He also worked as a model, beginning as a fashion and ramp model at the age of 13. He used his popularity as an actor to make gains in politics, serving as the 14th Mayor of San Juan from 1969 to 1986, as Senator from 1987 to 1992, then as Vice President under President Fidel V. Ramos from 1992 to 1998.

Estrada was elected president in 1998 with a wide margin of votes separating him from the other challengers and was sworn into the presidency on June 30, 1998. In 2000, he declared an &quot;all-out-war&quot; against Moro Islamic Liberation Front and captured its headquarters and other camps. Allegations of corruption spawned an impeachment trial in the Senate, and in 2001, Estrada was ousted in the Second EDSA Revolution after the prosecution walked out of the impeachment court when the senator-judges voted not to open an envelope that allegedly contained incriminating evidence against him. After his arrest on April 25, 2001, on charges of plunder, his supporters rallied and marched to Malacañang Palace and attempted to storm the premises in EDSA III.

In 2007, Estrada was sentenced by a special division of the Sandiganbayan to reclusión perpetua under a charge of plunder for the embezzlement of the $80 million from the government but was later granted a pardon by the president and his former deputy, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He ran for president again in the 2010 presidential election but was defeated by Senator Benigno Aquino III by a wide margin. He later served as the 22nd Mayor of Manila for two terms, from 2013 to 2019.

==Early life and education==

Joseph Estrada was born as Jose Marcelo Ejercito at 8:25 pm on April 19, 1937 in Tondo, an urban district of Manila. His family later moved to the wealthy suburb of San Juan, then a municipality in the province of Rizal. He belonged to a wealthy family and was the eighth of ten children of Emilio Ejercito Sr. (1899–1977) and his wife, Maria Marcelo (1906–2009). After graduating from the Ateneo Elementary School in 1951, he was expelled during his second year of secondary studies at the Ateneo High School for disciplinary conduct. Later during college, he enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering course at the Mapúa Institute of Technology to please his father. He would leave once again and later transferred to Central Colleges of the Philippines College of Engineering but dropped out.

Estrada began dating his St. John&#x27;s Academy schoolmate Mercedita &quot;Ditas&quot; Carmona at the age of 15, later losing his virginity to her at 17 years old. In the mid-1950s, Estrada nearly lost his life defending himself against a knife attack, and was rushed to the North General Hospital in Manila after the incident.

==Career==
===Film actor===
In his twenties, he began a career as a drama actor, usually playing the role of the villain/antagonist. He adopted the stage name &quot;Joseph Estrada&quot;, as his mother objected to his chosen career and his decision to quit schooling multiple times. He also acquired the nickname &quot;Erap&quot; (a play on the Tagalog slang &quot;pare&quot;, meaning &#x27;buddy&#x27;) from his friend, fellow actor Fernando Poe Jr.

Estrada gained popularity as a film actor, playing the lead role in over a hundred films in an acting career spanning some three decades.

In 1974, Estrada founded the Movie Workers Welfare Foundation (Mowelfund), which helps filmmakers through medical reimbursements, hospitalization, surgery and death benefits, livelihood, alternative income opportunities, and housing. Its educational arm, the Mowelfund Film Institute, has produced some of the most skilled and respected producers, filmmakers, writers, and performers in both the independent and mainstream sectors of the industry since its inception in 1979. He also founded, together with Guillermo de Vega, the first Metro Manila Film Festival in 1975.

===Entry into politics===
====Mayor of San Juan (1969–1986)====
Estrada entered politics in 1967, running for mayor of San Juan, failing and only succeeding in 1969 after winning an electoral protest against Braulio Sto. Domingo. His administration achieved many infrastructure developments. These included the establishment of the first Municipal High School, the Agora complex, a modern slaughterhouse, a sprawling government center with a post office, a mini-park, and the paving of 98 percent of the town&#x27;s roads and alleys.

As mayor, he paid particular attention to the elementary education of children by improving and renovating school buildings, constructing additional school structures, health centers, barangay halls, and playgrounds in all barangays, and providing artesian wells to areas with low water supply. He relocated some 1,800 squatter families out of San Juan to Taytay, Rizal, at no cost. He was also the first mayor to computerize the assessment of the Real Estate Tax at the Municipal Assessor&#x27;s Office. When Corazon Aquino assumed the presidency in 1986, all elected officials of the local government were forcibly removed and replaced by appointed officers-in-charge, including Estrada

====Senator of the Philippines (1987–1992)====
In 1987, Estrada won a seat in the Senate under the Grand Alliance for Democracy (GAD) placing 14th in the elections (out of 24 winners). He was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Public Works. He was Vice-Chairman of the Committees on Health, Natural Resources and Ecology, and Urban Planning.

In the Senate, Estrada sponsored bills on irrigation projects and the protection and propagation of the carabao, the beast of burden in the rural areas.

Estrada and eleven other senators (dubbed the &quot;Magnificent 12&quot; in media coverage) voted to terminate the RP-US Military Bases Agreement in 1991, leading to the withdrawal of American servicemen from the Clark Air Base in Pampanga and the Subic Naval Base in Zambales.

In 1989, the &quot;Free Press&quot; cited him as one of the Three Outstanding Senators of the Year. He was conferred the degree of Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa by the University of Pangasinan in 1990, and by the Bicol University in April 1997.

==Vice presidency (1992–1998)==

In 1992, Estrada initially ran for president under the Partido ng Masang Pilipino (PMP), with Vicente Rivera Jr. as his running mate and fellow actor Fernando Poe Jr. as his campaign manager. The Philippine film industry called for a 60-day &quot;moratorium&quot; on all film projects by March for industry figures to help Estrada&#x27;s presidential campaign. However, Estrada reluctantly withdrew his bid on March 30 due to financial issues and instead became the running mate of Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. under the Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition; Estrada expressed that the decision was &quot;very painful, if not traumatic&quot;. Though Cojuangco lost to former National Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos for the presidency, Estrada won the vice-presidency garnering more votes than his closest opponent Marcelo Fernan, Ramon Mitra Jr.&#x27;s running mate.

As vice president, Estrada was the chair of President Ramos&#x27; Presidential Anti-Crime Commission (PACC). Estrada arrested criminal warlords and kidnapping syndicates. He repeatedly topped surveys on government officials&#x27; performance conducted by the Social Weather Stations within his first two years as vice president and was named &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by ABS-CBN for 1993. He resigned as chair in 1997.

In the same year Estrada, together with former president Corazon Aquino, Cardinal Jaime Sin, Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and other political leaders, led an anti-charter change rally that brought in an estimated half a million people to Rizal Park against the charter change moves by Ramos and his supporters.

In early 1993, Estrada established Club 419 (later the International Business Club) in Cafe Ysabel within San Juan as a private men&#x27;s club for him and his friends, including Poe.

==Presidency (1998–2001)==


On June 30, 1998, Estrada took his oath of office at the historic Barasoain Church in Malolos, Bulacan. He also gave his inaugural address at the Quirino Grandstand where he promised to bring peace and harmony to the people and pledged to fight corruption and continue the economic reforms of the previous Ramos administration. 
The elected vice-president was Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo from the LAKAS-NUCD.

&quot;Erap Para sa Mahirap&quot; became the campaign slogan of the presidency. He drove his election campaign vehicle JEEP, which meant Justice, Economy, Environment, and Peace.

Estrada was the first president to use a special name as his official address name, combining his real family name, Ejercito, with his screen name, thus forming &quot;Joseph Ejercito Estrada&quot;. Estrada was inaugurated on June 30, 1998, in the historical town of Malolos in Bulacan province in paying tribute to the cradle of the First Philippine Republic. That afternoon the new president delivered his inaugural address at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta. He assumed office amid the Asian Financial Crisis and with agricultural problems due to poor weather conditions, thereby slowing the economic growth to −0.6% in 1998 from 5.2% in 1997. The economy recovered by 3.4% in 1999 and 4% in 2000. In 2000 he declared an &quot;all-out-war&quot; against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and captured its headquarters and other camps. Allegations of corruption spawned a railroaded impeachment trial in the Senate courtesy of house speaker Manuel Villar, and in 2001 Estrada was ousted by a coup after the trial was aborted.

In his inaugural address, Estrada said:
===Domestic policies===
====Rebellion in Mindanao====

During the Ramos administration a cessation of hostilities agreement was signed between the Philippine government and the MILF in July 1997. This was continued by a series of peace talks and negotiations in Estrada administration. The MILF, an Islamic group based in formed in 1977, seeks to be an independent Islamic state from the Philippines, and, despite the agreements, a sequence of terrorist attacks on the Philippine military and civilians still continued. These included the kidnapping of a foreign priest, namely Father Luciano Benedetti; the destruction by arson of Talayan, Maguindanao&#x27;s municipal hall; the takeover of the Kauswagan Municipal Hall; the bombing of the Lady of Mediatrix boat at Ozamiz City; and the takeover of the Narciso Ramos Highway. By doing so, they inflicted severe damage on the country&#x27;s image abroad, and scared much-needed investments away. For this reason, on
March 21, 2000, Estrada declared an &quot;all-out war&quot; against the MILF.

During the war the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) asked Estrada to negotiate a ceasefire with the MILF, but Estrada opposed the idea arguing that a ceasefire would cause more terrorist attacks. For the next three months of the war, Camp Abubakar, headquarters of the MILF, fell along with other 13 major camps and 43 minor camps, and then all of which became under controlled by the government. The MILF leader Hashim Salamat fled to Malaysia. The MILF later declared &quot;a jihad&quot; on the government. On July 10 of the same year, the Estrada went to Mindanao and raised the Philippine flag symbolizing victory. After the war Estrada said, &quot;... will speed up government efforts to bring genuine and lasting peace and development in Mindanao&quot;. In the middle of July Estrada ordered the military to arrest top MILF leaders.

In his state of the nation address (SONA), Estrada highlighted his vision for Mindanao:

* The first is to restore and maintain peace in Mindanao—because, without peace, there can be no development.
* The second is to develop Mindanao—because, without development, there can be no peace.
* The third is to continue seeking peace talks with the MILF within the framework of the Constitution—because a peace agreed upon in good faith is preferable to a peace enforced by force of arms.
* And the fourth is to continue with the implementation of the peace agreement between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF—because that is our commitment to our countrymen and the international community.

In addition to this Estrada said his administration can move with more speed in transforming Mindanao into a progressive economic center.[1] High on the list of priorities was the plight of MILF guerrillas who were tired of fighting and had no camps left to which to report. On October 5, 2000, the first massive surrender of 669 LC-MILF mujahideen led by the renegade vice mayor of Marugong, Lanao del Sur Malupandi Cosandi Sarip and seven other battalion commanders, surrendered to Estrada at the 4th ID headquarters in Camp Edilberto Evangelista, Bgy. Patag, Cagayan de Oro City. They were followed shortly by a second batch of 855 surrenderees led by Lost command MILF Commander Sayben Ampaso on December 29, 2000.[2]

===Foreign policies===
===Economy===
By the end of Estrada&#x27;s administration, debt supposedly reached 2.1 trillion in 1999. Domestic debt supposedly amounted to 986.7 billion while foreign debt stood at US$52.2 billion. The fiscal deficit had reportedly doubled to more than 100 billion from a low of 49 billion in 1998. Despite such setbacks, the GDP by 1999 posted a 3.2 percent growth rate, up from a low of −0.5 percent in 1998. Moreover, domestic investments started to increase from 18.8% of GDP in 1999 to 21.2% of GDP in 2000.

===Corruption charges and impeachment===
In October 2000, Ilocos Sur governor Luis &quot;Chavit&quot; Singson, a close friend of Estrada, alleged that he had personally given Estrada ₱400 million as the payoff from jueteng, a grassroots-based numbers game, hidden in a bank account known as &quot;Jose Velarde&quot;, as well as ₱180 million from the government price subsidy for the tobacco farmers&#x27; marketing cooperative after Estrada ordered a full-blown investigation into Chavit Singson&#x27;s alleged misuse of millions of pesos in public funds. Singson&#x27;s allegation caused controversy across the nation, which culminated in the House of Representatives&#x27; filing of an impeachment case against Estrada on November 13, 2000. House Speaker Manny Villar fast-tracked the impeachment complaint. The impeachment suit was brought to the Senate and an impeachment court was formed, with Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. as presiding officer. Estrada pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot;.

This was the first time the Filipino public witnessed, through radio and television, an elected president stand in trial and face possible impeachment with full media coverage. During the trial, the prosecution presented witnesses and alleged pieces of evidence to the impeachment court regarding Estrada&#x27;s alleged involvement in jueteng. The existence of secret bank accounts which he allegedly used for receiving payoffs was also brought to the fore.

In the 2004 Global Transparency Report by Transparency International, Estrada, together with Ferdinand Marcos, made it into the list of the World&#x27;s All-Time Most Corrupt Leaders in the World. Estrada was listed tenth and was said to have amassed between $78 million to $80 million.

===EDSA II===
====Protests====
On the evening of January 16, 2001, the impeachment court voted not to open an envelope that allegedly contained incriminating evidence against Estrada as it was not part of the impeachment complaint. The final vote was 11–10 to keep the envelope closed. The prosecution panel (of congressmen and lawyers) walked out of the impeachment court in protest of this vote. The 11 senators who voted not to open the envelope are known as the &quot;Craven Eleven.&quot; That night, anti-Estrada protesters gathered in front of the EDSA Shrine at Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, not too far away from the site of the 1986 People Power Revolution that overthrew President Ferdinand Marcos.

On January 19, 2001, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes, seeing the political upheaval throughout the country, decided to &quot;withdraw his support&quot; of Estrada and pay his allegiance to the vice president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

====Ouster from office====
The following day, the Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant even without Estrada&#x27;s resignation. At noon, Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was sworn in by Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. as president of the Philippines. Before Estrada departed from Malacañang, he issued the following press release:

The Supreme Court on March 2, 2001, upheld the constitutionality of Arroyo succeeding Estrada in a unanimous 13–0 decision in Estrada vs. Desierto.

===Administration and cabinet===
==Post-presidency (2001–present)==
===Arrest and EDSA III===

After being ousted from the presidency, Estrada returned to his family home in San Juan.

On April 25, 2001, the Sandiganbayan charged him and his son Jinggoy with plunder and had them arrested. His supporters marched to the EDSA Shrine to stage a protest demanding Estrada&#x27;s release and his reinstatement as president, among whom were his wife Loi Ejercito and political allies such as Juan Ponce Enrile, Panfilo Lacson, Gringo Honasan and Miriam Defensor Santiago. In the early morning of May 1, supporters of Estrada marched straight to the gates of Malacañang Palace, where violence erupted and forcing President Arroyo to declare a state of rebellion. Many protesters were injured in the ensuing riots and arrested, with four casualties, while many journalists were also injured due in part to the protesters&#x27; general hostility to the media. The government called out the military and was able to quell the riots with tear gases and warning shots under a &quot;maximum tolerance&quot; policy. The riots came to be generally known as EDSA III, though others have argued against the use of the name.

Estrada was initially detained at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City and then transferred to a military facility in Tanay, Rizal,[1] but he was later transferred to a nearby vacation home, virtually under house arrest. Under Philippine law at the time, plunder had the maximum penalty of death; the death penalty was eventually repealed by 2006.

===Trial===
On September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan gave its decision, finding Estrada not guilty in his perjury case but guilty of plunder &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. He was sentenced to &quot;reclusión perpetua&quot;. He was thus the first Philippine president to be convicted of plunder.[1]

On September 26, 2007, Estrada appealed by filing a 63-page motion for reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan judgment penned by Teresita de Castro (submitting five legal grounds).[2][3] Estrada alleged that the court erred &quot;when it convicted him by acquitting his alleged co-conspirators.&quot;[4]

On October 5, 2007, the Sandiganbayan&#x27;s Special Division ruled to set October 19 as an oral argument (instead of a defense reply) on Estrada&#x27;s motion for reconsideration. Estrada asked for the court&#x27;s permission to attend the hearing, since it ordered the prosecution to file a comment before October 11.[5]

===Perjury case===
The Sandiganbayan&#x27;s special division, on June 27, 2008, ordered Estrada to file a comment within 10 days, on the motion of the Ombudsman&#x27;s special prosecutor to re-open the trial of his perjury case regarding his 1999 statement of assets, liabilities, and net worth (SALN). The court was also to resolve Banco de Oro&#x27;s (formerly Equitable PCI Bank) plea that it could not determine &quot;without hazard to itself&quot; whom to turn over to the P1.1 billion Jose Velarde assets due to claims by Wellex Group / William Gatchalian and a Bureau of Internal Revenue stay order.

===Clemency and release from detention===
On October 22, 2007, Acting Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera stated that Estrada was seeking a &quot;full, free, and unconditional pardon&quot; from President Arroyo. Estrada&#x27;s lawyer Jose Flaminiano wrote Arroyo: &quot;The time has come to end President Estrada&#x27;s fight for justice and vindication before the courts. Today [Monday], we filed a withdrawal of his Motion for Reconsideration&quot;.&quot;&quot; Estrada stressed the &quot;delicate condition&quot; of his mother in asking for pardon.

On October 25, 2007, President Arroyo granted executive clemency to Estrada based on the recommendation by the Department of Justice (DoJ). Acting Executive Secretary and Press Secretary Ignacio R. Bunye quoted the signed Order: &quot;In view hereof in pursuant of the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant Executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusión perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights&quot;.&quot;&quot; Bunye noted that Estrada committed in his application not to seek public office, and he would be free from his Tanay resthouse on October 26, at noon. On October 26, 2007, after almost seven years of detention, Estrada was released after the Sandiganbayan promulgated the resolution.

===Activities===
When Estrada was released from detention, he gave a message to the Filipino people that he could once again help the lives of the people, especially the poor. He also stated that he made errors as a public servant but assured them that, notwithstanding his conviction for it, corruption was not one of them. After the message was released, he had a nationwide tour called &quot;Lakbay Pasasalamat&quot; (Thank you tour) during which he thanked the people for their support and gave them relief goods such as food, medicines and clothing.

== 2010 presidential election ==

During the 2010 presidential election, Estrada stated in interviews that he would be willing to run for the opposition if they would be unable to unite behind a single candidate. Fr. Joaquin Bernas and Christian Monsod, members of the constitutional commission that drafted the 1987 Constitution, stated that the constitution prohibited any elected president from seeking a second term at any point in time. Romulo Macalintal, election counsel of President Arroyo, clarified that the constitutional ban did not prevent Estrada from attaining the presidency if he were to be elevated from the vice-presidency, for example. Rufus Rodriquez, one of Estrada&#x27;s lawyers, claimed that Estrada was within his rights to do so because the prohibition banning re-election only applied to the incumbent president.

On October 22, 2009, Estrada announced that he would run again for president with Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay as his running mate. His senatorial lineup included Francisco Tatad, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada, Joey de Venecia, and Miriam Defensor Santiago. Estrada lost to Senator Benigno Aquino III in the election.

==Other activities==
In 1972, Estrada starred in &quot;Blood Compact&quot;.

In October 2010, the magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; included Estrada in its list of five former heads of states/governments who did not make &quot;a positive difference in the world&quot;, but &quot;faded away into obscurity.&quot; Also included in this &quot;Bad Exes&quot; list were Thailand&#x27;s Thaksin Shinawatra, Spain&#x27;s Jose Maria Aznar, and Germany&#x27;s Gerhard Schroder.

Estrada announced in November 2010 that he would be selling his home in San Juan for about to pursue his real estate business. Agence France Presse reported that Estrada &quot;has put up two high-rise residential condominium buildings and plans to build a third soon.&quot;

==Mayor of Manila (2013–2019)==

In May 2012, Estrada announced his intention to run for Mayor of Manila in the 2013 elections to continue his political career.

Around noon of May 14, 2013, the day after the conduct of the 2013 Philippine mid-term elections, Estrada and his running-mate and re-electionist Vice Mayor Francisco &quot;Isko&quot; Moreno Domagoso were proclaimed mayor-elect and vice mayor-elect, respectively, by the City Board of Canvassers for the City of Manila. When Estrada assumed office on June 30, 2013, the city government coffers were practically bankrupt as his administration inherited as much as in debts. During his first term as mayor of Manila, Estrada implemented a city-wide bus ban, truck ban, and revival program especially on Escolta Street. In 2015, Estrada declared the city debt-free after instituting various fiscal reforms.

Originally planning to serve for one term only, he changed his mind and ran for reelection in 2016. This time, his running mate was former 4th District Councilor and OIC - City Social Welfare Officer Dr. Honey Lacuna Pangan. Estrada won in a tight race over former Mayor Alfredo Lim by around 2,000 votes, while Lacuna was elected vice mayor as well. Estrada best described his accomplishments as Mayor of Manila as having been able to provide the basic needs of Manileños “from womb to tomb.” He boasted of comprehensive public services from free hospital and medical care services to all residents of Manila starting from mothers giving birth, free books, uniforms, and health snacks for public school students, all the way to free burial and cremation.
Estrada has also shown support for the controversial Manila Bay reclamation, with the fourth reclamation project approved on June 7, 2017. Estrada, however, was widely criticized for a publicity stunt at a clean-up drive in Manila Bay on July 21, 2017. On September 28, 2018, Estrada settled the city&#x27;s tax liabilities, left unpaid by former mayors Lito Atienza and Alfredo Lim, to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

After serving two consecutive terms as mayor, Estrada intended to run for a third term in 2019, competing against former Manila vice mayor Isko Moreno Domagoso and former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim; Estrada chose former 5th District Representative Amado Bagatsing as his running mate for vice mayor. Estrada lost to Domagoso, who beat him by more than 100,000 votes in a landslide victory. Estrada conceded defeat on the evening of May 13 and stepped down on June 30.

==In popular culture==
Since the beginning of his political career, Estrada has been the butt of many jokes, called &quot;ERAP Jokes&quot;, in the Philippines.

<text>In computing, a crash, or system crash, occurs when a computer program such as a software application or an operating system stops functioning properly and exits. On some operating systems or individual applications, a crash reporting service will report the crash and any details relating to it (or give the user the option to do so), usually to the developer(s) of the application. If the program is a critical part of the operating system, the entire system may crash or hang, often resulting in a kernel panic or fatal system error, on Windows this can result in a Blue Screen.

Most crashes are the result of a software bug. Typical causes include accessing invalid memory addresses, incorrect address values in the program counter, buffer overflow, overwriting a portion of the affected program code due to an earlier bug, executing invalid machine instructions (an illegal or unauthorized opcode), or triggering an unhandled exception. The original software bug that started this chain of events is typically considered to be the cause of the crash, which is discovered through the process of debugging. The original bug can be far removed from the code that actually triggered the crash.

In early personal computers, attempting to write data to hardware addresses outside the system&#x27;s main memory could cause hardware damage. Some crashes are exploitable and let a malicious program or hacker execute arbitrary code, allowing the replication of viruses or the acquisition of data which would normally be inaccessible.

==Application crashes==
An application typically crashes when it performs an operation that is not allowed by the operating system. The operating system then triggers an exception or signal in the application. Unix applications traditionally responded to the signal by dumping core. Most Windows and Unix GUI applications respond by displaying a dialogue box (such as the one shown in the accompanying image) with the option to attach a debugger if one is installed. Some applications attempt to recover from the error and continue running instead of exiting.

An application can also contain code to crash after detecting a severe error.

Typical errors that result in application crashes include:
*attempting to read or write memory that is not allocated for reading or writing by that application (e.g., segmentation fault, x86-specific general protection fault)
*attempting to execute privileged or invalid instructions
*attempting to perform I/O operations on hardware devices to which it does not have permission to access
*passing invalid arguments to system calls
*attempting to access other system resources to which the application does not have permission to access
*attempting to execute machine instructions with bad arguments (depending on CPU architecture): divide by zero, operations on denormal number or NaN (not a number) values, memory access to unaligned addresses, etc.

===Crash to desktop===
A &quot;crash to desktop&quot; (CTD) is said to occur when a program (commonly a video game) unexpectedly quits, abruptly taking the user back to the desktop. Usually, the term is applied only to crashes where no error is displayed, hence all the user sees as a result of the crash is the desktop. Many times there is no apparent action that causes a crash to desktop. During normal function, the program may freeze for a shorter period of time, and then close by itself. Also during normal function, the program may become a black screen and repeatedly play the last few seconds of sound (depending on the size of the audio buffer) that was being played before it crashes to desktop. Other times it may appear to be triggered by a certain action, such as loading an area.

CTD bugs are considered particularly problematic for users. Since they frequently display no error message, it can be very difficult to track down the source of the problem, especially if the times they occur and the actions taking place right before the crash do not appear to have any pattern or common ground. One way to track down the source of the problem for games is to run them in windowed-mode. Certain operating system versions may feature one or more tools to help track down causes of CTD problems.

Some computer programs such as &quot;StepMania&quot; and BBC&#x27;s &quot;Bamzooki&quot; also crash to desktop if in full-screen, but display the error in a separate window when the user has returned to the desktop.

==Web server crashes==
The software running the web server behind a website may crash, rendering it inaccessible entirely or providing only an error message instead of normal content.

For example, if a site is using an SQL database (such as MySQL) for a script (such as PHP) and that SQL database server crashes, then PHP will display a connection error.

==Operating system crashes==
An operating system crash commonly occurs when a hardware exception occurs that cannot be handled. Operating system crashes can also occur when internal sanity-checking logic within the operating system detects that the operating system has lost its internal self-consistency.

Modern multi-tasking operating systems, such as Linux, and macOS, usually remain unharmed when an application program crashes.

Some operating systems, e.g., z/OS, have facilities for Reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) and the OS can recover from the crash of a critical component, whether due to hardware failure, e.g., uncorrectable ECC error, or to software failure, e.g., a reference to an unassigned page.

===Abnormal end===
An Abnormal end or ABEND is an abnormal termination of software, or a program crash. Errors or crashes on the Novell NetWare network operating system are usually called ABENDs. Communities of NetWare administrators sprang up around the Internet, such as abend.org.

This usage derives from the &quot;ABEND&quot; macro on IBM OS/360, ..., z/OS operating systems. Usually capitalized, but may appear as &quot;abend&quot;. Some common ABEND codes are System ABEND 0C7 (data exception) and System ABEND 0CB (division by zero). Abends can be &quot;soft&quot; (allowing automatic recovery) or &quot;hard&quot; (terminating the activity). The term is jocularly claimed to be derived from the German word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;evening&quot;.

==Security and privacy implications of crashes==
Depending on the application, the crash may contain the user&#x27;s sensitive and private information. Moreover, many software bugs which cause crashes are also exploitable for arbitrary code execution and other types of privilege escalation. For example, a stack buffer overflow can overwrite the return address of a subroutine with an invalid value, which will cause, e.g., a segmentation fault, when the subroutine returns. However, if an exploit overwrites the return address with a valid value, the code in that address will be executed.

==Crash reproduction==
When crashes are collected in the field using a crash reporter, the next step for developers is to be able to reproduce them locally. For this, several techniques exist:
STAR uses symbolic execution,
EvoCrash performs evolutionary search.

<doc id="279632" wikidata="Q11327642" url="?curid=279632" title="Bus error">
<text>In computing, a bus error is a fault raised by hardware, notifying an operating system (OS) that a process is trying to access memory that the CPU cannot physically address: an invalid address for the address bus, hence the name. In modern use on most architectures these are much rarer than segmentation faults, which occur primarily due to memory access violations: problems in the &quot;logical&quot; address or permissions.

On POSIX-compliant platforms, bus errors usually result in the SIGBUS signal being sent to the process that caused the error. SIGBUS can also be caused by any general device fault that the computer detects, though a bus error rarely means that the computer hardware is physically broken—it is normally caused by a bug in software. Bus errors may also be raised for certain other paging errors; see below.

==Causes==
There are at least three main causes of bus errors:

===Non-existent address===
Software instructs the CPU to read or write a specific physical memory address. Accordingly, the CPU sets this physical address on its address bus and requests all other hardware connected to the CPU to respond with the results, if they answer for this specific address. If no other hardware responds, the CPU raises an exception, stating that the requested physical address is unrecognized by the whole computer system. Note that this only covers &quot;physical&quot; memory addresses. Trying to access an undefined virtual memory address is generally considered to be a segmentation fault rather than a bus error, though if the MMU is separate, the processor cannot tell the difference.

===Unaligned access===
Most CPUs are &quot;byte-addressable&quot;, where each unique memory address refers to an 8-bit byte. Most CPUs can access individual bytes from each memory address, but they generally cannot access larger units (16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits and so on) without these units being &quot;aligned&quot; to a specific boundary (the x86 platform being a notable exception).

For example, if multi-byte accesses must be 16 bit-aligned, addresses (given in bytes) at 0, 2, 4, 6, and so on would be considered aligned and therefore accessible, while addresses 1, 3, 5, and so on would be considered unaligned. Similarly, if multi-byte accesses must be 32-bit aligned, addresses 0, 4, 8, 12, and so on would be considered aligned and therefore accessible, and all addresses in between would be considered unaligned. Attempting to access a unit larger than a byte at an unaligned address can cause a bus error.

Some systems may have a hybrid of these depending on the architecture being used. For example, for hardware based on the IBM System/360 mainframe, including the IBM System z, Fujitsu B8000, RCA Spectra, and UNIVAC Series 90, instructions must be on a 16-bit boundary, that is, execution addresses must start on an even byte. Attempts to branch to an odd address results in a specification exception. Data, however, may be retrieved from any address in memory, and may be one byte or longer depending on the instruction.

CPUs generally access data at the full width of their data bus at all times. To address bytes, they access memory at the full width of their data bus, then mask and shift to address the individual byte. Systems tolerate this inefficient algorithm, as it is an essential feature for most software, especially string processing. Unlike bytes, larger units can span two aligned addresses and would thus require more than one fetch on the data bus.
It is possible for CPUs to support this, but this functionality is rarely required directly at the machine code level, thus CPU designers normally avoid implementing it and instead issue bus errors for unaligned memory access.

===Paging errors===
FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris can signal a bus error when virtual memory pages cannot be paged in, e.g. because it has disappeared (e.g. accessing a memory-mapped file or executing a binary image which has been truncated while the program was running), or because a just-created memory-mapped file cannot be physically allocated, because the disk is full.

===Non-present segment (x86)===
On x86 there exists an older memory management mechanism known as segmentation.
If the application loads a segment register with the selector of a non-present segment (which under POSIX-compliant OSes
can only be done with assembly language), the exception
is generated. Some OSes used that for swapping, but under Linux this generates SIGBUS.

==Example==
This is an example of unaligned memory access, written in the C programming language with AT&amp;T assembly syntax.
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) 
 int *iptr;
 char *cptr;
#if defined(__GNUC__)
# if defined(__i386__)
 /* Enable Alignment Checking on x86 */
 __asm__(&quot;pushf\norl $0x40000,(%esp)\npopf&quot;);
# elif defined(__x86_64__) 
 /* Enable Alignment Checking on x86_64 */
 __asm__(&quot;pushf\norl $0x40000,(%rsp)\npopf&quot;);
# endif
#endif

 /* malloc() always provides memory which is aligned for all fundamental types */
 cptr = malloc(sizeof(int) + 1);
 /* Increment the pointer by one, making it misaligned */
 iptr = (int *) ++cptr;

 /* Dereference it as an int pointer, causing an unaligned access */
 *iptr = 42;
 Following accesses will also result in sigbus error.
 short *sptr;
 int i;

 sptr = (short *)&amp;i;
 // For all odd value increments, it will result in sigbus.
 sptr = (short *)(((char *)sptr) + 1);
 *sptr = 100;
 */

 return 0;


Compiling and running the example on a POSIX compliant OS on x86 demonstrates the error:

$ gcc -ansi sigbus.c -o sigbus
$ ./sigbus 
Bus error
$ gdb ./sigbus
(gdb) r
Program received signal SIGBUS, Bus error.
0x080483ba in main ()
(gdb) x/i $pc
0x80483ba &lt;main+54&gt;: mov DWORD PTR [eax],0x2a
(gdb) p/x $eax
$1 = 0x804a009
(gdb) p/t $eax &amp; (sizeof(int) - 1)
$2 = 1

The GDB debugger shows that the immediate value 0x2a is being stored at the location stored in the EAX register, using X86 assembly language. This is an example of register indirect addressing.

Printing the low order bits of the address shows that it is not aligned to a word boundary (&quot;dword&quot; using x86 terminology).

<doc id="279637" wikidata="Q289694" url="?curid=279637" title="Abigail Williams">
<text>Abigail Williams (born c. 1681, date of death unknown) was an 11- or 12-year-old girl who, along with nine-year-old Betty Parris, was among the first of the children to falsely accuse their neighbors of witchcraft in 1692; these accusations eventually led to the Salem witch trials.

==Salem Trials==
In early 1692, Abigail Williams was living with her relative, Betty Parris&#x27;s father, the village pastor Samuel Parris, along with his two slaves Tituba and John Indian.

Tituba was part of a group of three women—with Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne—who were the first to be arrested, on February 29, 1692, under the accusation that their specters (ghosts) were afflicting the young girls in Parris&#x27; household. The three women were questioned separately but were aware of each other and, in a classic prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, they were turned against each other. Sarah Good was the first interrogated and held to her innocence. Judge John Hathorne directed all &quot;the children ... to look upon her and see if this were the person that hurt them ... and they all did look upon her&quot; and claimed her specter tormented them. &quot;Sarah Good ... why do you thus torment these poor children?&quot; Hathorne asked. &quot;What do I know, you bring others here and now you charge me with it,&quot; Sarah Good responded. Next Hathorne interrogated Sarah Osbourne, who claimed not to know Sarah Good or her full name. But Hathorne told her, &quot;Sarah Good said that it was you that hurt the children.&quot; According to the transcript, this distorts what Sarah Good had said, as she had only vaguely referred to the others without naming them, in a way that was only intended to deflect blame from herself. Tituba was interrogated last and was the only of the three women to offer a full and elaborate confession against herself and pointing the finger of blame at the other two women: &quot;Sarah Good and Osbourne would have me hurt the children.&quot; According to an investigation by Robert Calef that began soon after the trials, Tituba later recanted her confession as forced and claimed abuse from the slaveowner Parris:

&quot;The account she [Tituba] since gives of it is that her master [Parris] did beat her and otherwise abuse her, to make her confess and accuse, such as he [Parris] called her &#x27;sister-witches&#x27; and that whatever she said by way of confessing or accusing others, was the effect of such usage.&quot;

Further accusations against many others emerged from the Parris household (and others) and eventually led to the imprisonment of hundreds and the deaths of more than 20 in 1692. Sarah Osborne died in prison in May and Sarah Good was executed on July 19 along with four other women. Members of Parris household all managed to survive the entire episode including Tituba, who was released from jail a year later, when the slaveowner Parris paid her prison fees and sold her.

== Later life ==
After the Salem witch trials, Williams disappeared from records circa 1696. Her fate is unknown.

==Legacy==
===&quot;The Crucible&quot;===
In Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1953 play, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, a fictionalized story of the Salem witch trials, Abigail Williams is the name of a character whose age in the play is raised a full five or six years, to age 17, and she is motivated by a desire to be in a relationship with John Proctor, a married farmer with whom she had previously had an affair. In the historical record, there is no evidence of John Proctor and Abigail Williams ever meeting before the trials had started. She was portrayed by Winona Ryder in the 1996 film adaptation of the play.

=== Other popular culture ===
In John Neal&#x27;s 1828 novel &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot;, Abigail Williams appears as the character Bridget Pope. Neal links the origin of the witch hysteria to her sexual development, and her bewitched behavior stems from sexual frustration that is calmed too late when she is reunited with her love interest, Robert Eveleth, after the trials have already begun.

Abigail Williams is an American black metal band formed in 2004.

Abigail appears in the 2010 film &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; as a minor antagonist. 

The 2013 play, &quot;Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; (originally titled &quot;A Discourse on the Wonders of the Invisible World&quot;) by Liz Duffy Adams tells the fictional story of Abigail William&#x27;s return to New England ten years after the witch trials.

Abigail is revealed as the antagonist of the 2014 video game &quot;&quot;. In the story, flashbacks reveal that she was hanged for her part in the witch trials. Over the centuries, she has existed as a ghost, using her supernatural powers to kill those she believes are witches. In the game&#x27;s climax, she is seized by demons and dragged to Hell.

&quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, a 2015 online free-to-play role-playing mobile game, has a character under the &quot;Foreigner&quot; class based on both Abigail Williams and Yog-Sothoth. She plays a central role in the plot of the last Pseudo-Singularity chapter, Salem, which takes place during an alternate version of the Salem witch trials.

The 2020 video game &quot;Little Hope&quot; includes a spin-off of Abigail&#x27;s history and the Salem witch trials as one of the three timelines.

Abigail is the central character in the play &quot;Abigail/1702: A Twice Told Tale&quot;, by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. It premiered at the South Camden Theater Company, Waterfront South Theatre, in Camden, New Jersey, in February 2020.

===Convulsive ergotism===
In 1976, Linnda R. Caporael put forward the hypothesis that ergot-tainted rye may have been the source of accusations of bewitchment that spurred the Salem witch trials. Caporael argued that many of its convulsive symptoms were all symptoms reported in the Salem witchcraft records. This theory has been refuted by both toxicologists and historians of the Salem witch trials, in part because of the difference in the ages of the core group of accusers, which would have been younger, per prior ergotism epidemics, and would have affected males and females roughly equally. The ergotism theory is critiqued for failing to explain the differences in affliction rates between males and females and that no records suggest the allegedly affected experienced all symptoms to ergotism or had long-term health effects. Additionally, most historical outbreaks of ergotism would affect entire families or communities who shared a similar diet. At the severity of supposed symptoms experienced by accusers, the levels of ergot would have been high enough to cause symptoms in adults in the community.

<text>Elizabeth Parris (November 28, 1682 – March 21, 1760) was one of the young girls who accused other people of being witches during the Salem witch trials. The accusations made by Parris and her cousin Abigail Williams caused the direct death of 20 Salem residents: 19 were hanged, while another, Giles Corey, was pressed to death.

==Early life==
Parris was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on November 28, 1682. Her father, Samuel Parris, was a well-known minister in the Salem Church. Her mother, Elizabeth Parris, died a few years after the witch trials. Her older brother Thomas Parris was born in 1681, and her younger sister Susanna Parris was born in 1687. Others living in the Parris household included Betty&#x27;s orphaned cousin, Abigail Williams, and Tituba, a slave from Barbados.

Her father was appointed the Minister of Salem Church in 1688 following a community effort to find a new minister. His family, including his wife Elizabeth, son Thomas, daughters Betty and Susannah, Abigail Williams, and Tituba all moved from Boston to join Parris in Salem. By contract, Parris and his family were granted to live in the ministry house and owned the land around it. The house accommodated the whole Parris family including Abigail, Tituba, and another slave by the name of John.

==Salem witch trials==
===Overview===
In 1692, the Salem witch trials broke out after several girls claimed to be targeted by a &#x27;devilish hand&#x27;. After several months, over 150 men, women, and children were charged with witchcraft and sorcery. The Trials were diminishing around September 1692 when the public began to resist the idea of witchcraft. Eventually, the Massachusetts General Court granted freedom to all those accused of sorcery and apologized to their families for the hardships created by the Salem witch trials.

===Betty Parris&#x27; role===
Shortly after Samuel Parris&#x27; affairs with the church in 1692, his daughter Elizabeth (Betty) Parris and niece Abigail Williams seemed to go missing for short periods of time. &quot;... Along with other New England youth, Elizabeth and Abigail had been led away with little Sorceries&quot; (105). Elizabeth, Abigail, and the girls attempted fortune-telling methods during their missing periods in hopes of discovering future husbands and social statuses. They used an object called a &quot;Venus glass&quot;, which allowed them to observe the shape of an egg white as it floated in a glass of water. In the water, the egg white would resemble a shape or symbol depicting their futures. In one instance, a girl found a coffin shape inside her glass and became quite frightened after the incident according to John Hale&#x27;s &quot;A Modest Enquiry Into the Nature of Witchcraft&quot;.

Betty&#x27;s other friends were also beginning to show similar symptoms of bewitching. Griggs found it difficult to key in on an exact cure and noticed the victims were only children. This enabled other villagers to believe that this event was indeed brought on by witchcraft. A neighbor, Mary Sibley, recommended a witch&#x27;s cake to reveal the names of the witches. She instructed Tituba to bake a rye cake with the victim&#x27;s urine and feed the cake to a dog. Dogs were believed to support witches and their supernatural powers by following the witches&#x27; requests. Without alleviation of the illness, Betty eventually named Tituba as one of the &#x27;Evil Hands&#x27;. Linder suggests Elizabeth and Abigail wrote their story before making any accusations allowing their scenario to be more realistic. In the meantime, Tituba underwent questioning, and other victims, such as Ann Putnam Jr. and Elizabeth Hubbard, began to name their culprits as well. Other specified witches including Sarah Osborne and Sarah Good were questioned. All three would likely have had few if any advocates on their behalf due to their low social status in Salem. During their trials, Tituba confessed as well as turning in the other two women.

Later that year in March, Elizabeth dreamed about a &quot;Black Man&quot; who she presumed was the Devil. He wanted her to join his forces and be &quot;ruled by him.&quot; However, Betty&#x27;s family found this extremely terrifying and sent her off to live with another family, the Sewalls, hoping she could get away from witchcraft. In the Sewall household, Betty did experience some symptoms but ultimately regained full health.

==Later life==
In 1693, the Salem witch trials ended. Betty Parris never retracted her accusations or made any acknowledgements. 

In 1710, aged 27, she married Benjamin Baron, a yeoman, trader, cordwainer, and shoemaker. Her father still cared for her and her siblings. Parris provided her with &quot;household stuff&quot; to better furnish her home with Benjamin. He bought her silver, money, and plates as well as pictures and décor to hang on the walls. She and Baron had four children: Thomas, Elizabeth, Catherine, and Susanna. Betty survived her husband by six years, dying on March 21, 1760, in Concord, Massachusetts, aged 77.

==In fiction and popular culture==
Betty Parris appears as Samuel Parris&#x27; daughter in John Neal&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; (1828).

Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1952 play &quot;The Crucible&quot; is loosely based on actual events that Betty/Elizabeth Parris and other contributing characters faced during the actual Salem Witch Trials in the 1600s. Some aspects of the play are accurate in comparison to the real event while others are not. According to all reliable sources, Elizabeth had two siblings, and in &quot;The Crucible&quot; she has none. She is a supporting character as a 10-year-old girl who falls under a strange illness, which leads to dissembling a bunch of young women&#x27;s behavior and, soon, many accusations of witchcraft against other citizens of Salem.

In the 2020 video game &quot;Death end re;Quest 2&quot;, there are two characters named Betty Paris and Elizabeth Paris. Though they are not accused of witchcraft in the game, their names may be a reference to the characters in the play since the game has themes that are inspired by Christianity.

<text>Benigno Simeon Aquino III (; born Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III; February 8, 1960 – June 24, 2021), also known as Noynoy Aquino and colloquially as PNoy, was a Filipino politician who served as the 15th President of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016. The son of assassinated politician Benigno Aquino Jr. and 11th President of the Philippines Corazon Aquino, he was a fourth-generation politician as part of the Aquino family of Tarlac.

Benigno Aquino III previously served as a member of the House of Representatives and Senate from 1998 to 2010, and also as a deputy speaker of the House of Representatives from 2004 to 2006. On September 9, 2009, shortly after the death of his mother, he announced his candidacy in the 2010 presidential election, which he eventually won. He was sworn into office as the 15th president of the Philippines on June 30, 2010, succeeding Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

Under Aquino&#x27;s presidency, the nation&#x27;s economy grew at the highest rates in decades, and the country was dubbed a &quot;Rising Tiger&quot; economy. Known for his confrontational foreign policy, his administration filed an arbitration case, &quot;Philippines v. China&quot;, before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in an attempt to invalidate China&#x27;s claims in the South China Sea and assert the Philippines&#x27; claims in the area; the court ruled in favor of the Philippines. His term ended on June 30, 2016, and he was succeeded by Rodrigo Duterte.

After leaving office, Aquino was the subject of legal actions over his role in the Mamasapano clash and for approval of a controversial budget project; he was later acquitted of all charges filed against him regarding the Mamasapano incident. Aquino died from diabetic kidney disease on June 24, 2021, at age 61.

== Early life and education ==
Noynoy Aquino was born as Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III on February 8, 1960, at Far Eastern University Hospital in Sampaloc, Manila. He is the third of the five children of Benigno Aquino Jr., who was then the vice governor of Tarlac, and Corazon Cojuangco, daughter of prominent Tarlac businessman José Cojuangco. He has four sisters, namely: Maria Elena, Aurora Corazon, Victoria Elisa, and actress Kristina Bernadette. He attended the Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City for his elementary, high school, and college education.

Aquino finished his Bachelor of Arts (major in economics) degree from the Ateneo in 1981. Former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, his eventual predecessor, was one of his professors at the university.

In September 1972, his father, a senator and prominent opposition leader to President Ferdinand Marcos, was arrested for subversion. In August 1973, Aquino&#x27;s father was brought before a military tribunal in Fort Bonifacio.

In 1980, after a series of heart attacks, Aquino&#x27;s father was allowed to seek medical treatment in the United States, where Aquino&#x27;s family began a period of self-exile in Boston. After graduating, Aquino joined his family there in 1981.

In 1983, after three years in exile in the United States, Aquino&#x27;s family returned to the Philippines, shortly after the assassination of his father on August 21, 1983. He had a short tenure as a member of the Philippine Business for Social Progress, working as an assistant of the executive director. He later joined Mondragon Industries Philippines, Inc. as an assistant retail sales supervisor and Nike Philippines as an assistant promotions manager.

From 1986 to 1992, during the presidency of his mother, Aquino joined the Intra-Strata Assurance Corporation, a company owned by his uncle Antolin Oreta Jr., as vice president.

On August 28, 1987, eighteen months into the presidency of Aquino&#x27;s mother, rebel soldiers led by Gregorio Honasan staged an unsuccessful coup attempt, attempting to lay siege to Malacañang Palace. Aquino was two blocks from the palace when he came under fire. Three of Aquino&#x27;s four security escorts were killed, and the last was wounded protecting him. He himself was hit by five bullets, once in the neck.

From 1993 to 1998, he worked for Central Azucarera de Tarlac, the sugar refinery in the Cojuangco-owned Hacienda Luisita. He was employed as the executive assistant for administration from 1993 to 1996 and subsequently worked as manager for field services from 1996 to 1998.

== Congressional career ==
Aquino was a fourth-generation politician: his great-grandfather, Servillano &quot;Mianong&quot; Aquino, served as a delegate to the Malolos Congress; his paternal grandfather, Benigno Aquino Sr., served as Speaker of the National Assembly from 1943 to 1944; his maternal grandfather, José Cojuangco, was also a member of the House of Representatives; and his parents were Corazon Aquino, who served as the 11th president of the Philippines (1986–1992), and Senator Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr. Aquino was a member of the Liberal Party, where he held various positions such as secretary general and vice president for Luzon.

=== House of Representatives (1998–2007) ===
Aquino became a deputy speaker of the House of Representatives on November 8, 2004, but relinquished the post on February 21, 2006, when Aquino joined his Liberal Party Drilon wing members in calling for the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo at the height of the Hello Garci scandal.

Aquino was also Chairman of the Board of the Central Luzon Congressional Caucus.

=== Senate (2007–2010) ===
Barred from running for re-election to the House of Representatives of the Philippines, to represent the 2nd district of Tarlac, due to term limits, Aquino was elected to the Senate of the Philippines in the 2007 Philippine midterm election on May 15, 2007, under the banner of the Genuine Opposition (GO), a coalition comprising a number of parties, including Aquino&#x27;s own Liberal Party, seeking to curb attempts by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to amend the 1987 Philippine Constitution. In Aquino&#x27;s political ads, he was endorsed by his younger sister, television host Kris Aquino, and his mother, Corazon Aquino. Although a Roman Catholic, Aquino was endorsed by the pentecostal Jesus Is Lord Church, one of the largest Protestant churches in the Philippines. With more than votes, Aquino&#x27;s tally was the sixth highest of the 37 candidates for the 12 vacant seats elected from the nation at large. Aquino assumed his new office on June 30, 2007.

During the campaign, Aquino reached out to his former political rival, Senator Gregorio Honasan, supporting his application for bail. Aquino told Job Tabada of the &quot;Cebu Daily News&quot;, on March 5, 2007:

Aquino was referring to an unsuccessful coup attempt staged by rebel soldiers led by Gregorio Honasan on August 28, 1987, in which Aquino was seriously injured.

==== Senate bills ====
The Budget Impoundment and Control Act (Senate Bill No. 3121), wherein &quot;impoundment&quot; refers to the power of the president to refuse the release of funds appropriated by the Congress of the Philippines, is another bill Aquino was proud of; he regretted, however, that such power has been used and abused by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a result of which abuse has been the significant emasculation of Congress&#x27; ability to check the president&#x27;s authority. Aquino filed this bill so that the president would have to pass a measure through Congress every time that they the chief executive had the impetus to impound part of the budget.

Another significant Aquino contribution to the Philippines&#x27; corruption problem was Senate Bill 2035, which is the &quot;Preservation of Public Infrastructures&quot; bill, seeking to raise standards in the construction of all public infrastructures by penalizing contractors of defective infrastructures. The bill also requires the Bureau of Maintenance under the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to conduct periodic inspections of public infrastructures.

Aquino also pushed for the passage of the Amending the Government Procurement Act (SB 2160), which applies to all government procurement activities regardless of source of funds whether local or foreign; only treaties or international/executive agreements entered into by the government prior to its enactment shall be exempt from coverage. The bill was filed in light of the Department of Justice (DOJ) declaration regarding the validity of the NBN–ZTE deal corruption scandal, wherein its international aspect, as well as the fact that it was an executive agreement, was cited as one reason for its exemption from the procurement process stipulated in Republic Act No. 9184.

Focusing further on accountability in government appropriations and spending, Aquino filed other reform-oriented bills, among which were Philippine National Police reform; the banning of reappointment to the Judicial and Bar Council; and the prevention of reappointment and bypassing of the Commission on Appointments.

== 2010 presidential campaign ==

On November 26, 2008, the Liberal Party elected Mar Roxas, president of the Liberal Party, as the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party for President of the Philippines in the then-upcoming 2010 presidential elections.

Following the death and funeral of Aquino&#x27;s mother, former President Corazon Aquino, many people began calling on Aquino to run for President of the Philippines. This groundswell of support became known as the &quot;Noynoy Phenomenon&quot;.

On August 27, 2009, Edgardo &quot;Eddie&quot; Roces, son of the late journalist and media executive Chino Roces, and a group of lawyers and activists formed the Noynoy Aquino for President Movement (NAPM), a nationwide campaign to collect a million signatures in order to persuade Aquino to run for president, reminiscent of Roces&#x27; father, who on October 15, 1985, launched the Cory Aquino for President Movement (CAPM), collecting more than one million signatures nationwide and asking Aquino&#x27;s mother to run against Ferdinand Marcos in the 1986 presidential snap elections.

On September 1, 2009, at the Club Filipino, in a press conference, Senator Mar Roxas, president of the Liberal Party, announced his withdrawal from the 2010 presidential race and expressed his support for Aquino, as the party standard-bearer instead. Aquino later stood side by side with Roxas, but did not make a public statement at the press conference. The next day, Aquino announced that he would be going on a &quot;spiritual retreat&quot; over the weekend to finalize his decision for the elections, visiting the Carmelite sisters in Zamboanga City, reminiscent of his mother&#x27;s own soul-searching in 1985 before deciding to run for the elections the following year. He came back on September 9 to formally announce his candidacy. Almost two weeks later, Roxas pledged to run alongside Aquino as the Liberal Party standard-bearer for vice-president. The two men filed their respective certificates of candidacy for president and vice-president on November 28, 2009.

Fake psychiatric reports on Aquino&#x27;s mental health began circulating online during the 90-day election campaign period from February 9 – May 8, 2010, Aquino received information that the first such report came from the wife of Nacionalista Party supporter and former National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) president Guido Delgado, a move Aquino claimed was made with &quot;malicious intent&quot;. A second report came from an unidentified supporter of Senator Manny Villar, the Nacionalistas&#x27; leader and presidential candidate. Later presented by Delgado at a press conference, the psychiatric report was supposedly signed by Father Jaime C. Bulatao, S.J., PhD, a Jesuit priest, a professor of Psychology and a clinical psychologist at the Ateneo de Manila University, taken when Aquino was finishing his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics at the university in 1979. It reportedly showed that Aquino suffered from depression and melancholia; the priest later denied writing the document at all. Another supposed psychiatric report that later surfaced claimed that Aquino suffered from major depressive disorder; the report&#x27;s supposed author, Jesuit priest Father Carmelo A. Caluag II, denied writing any evaluations of Aquino. The university&#x27;s psychology department later debunked the documents, with Aquino labelling them as another desperate effort by rivals to malign his reputation.

During the campaign, Senator Francis Escudero began endorsing Aquino as president and PDP–Laban standard-bearer Jejomar Binay, for Vice President, launching the Aquino–Binay campaign.

On June 9, 2010, at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, in Quezon City, the Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Aquino as the president-elect of the Philippines, following the 2010 election with 15,208,678 votes, while Jejomar Binay, the former mayor of Makati, was proclaimed as the vice president-elect of the Philippines with 14,645,574 votes, defeating runner-up for the vice presidency Mar Roxas, the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party for vice president.

== Presidency (2010–2016) ==

===Early years===
The presidency of Benigno Aquino III began at noon on June 30, 2010, and became the fifteenth president of the Philippines, succeeding Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. From the start of his presidency on, he was also referred to in the media as &quot;PNoy&quot;.

The presidential transition began on June 9, 2010, when the Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Aquino the winner of the 2010 Philippine presidential elections held on May 10, 2010, proclaiming Aquino as the president-elect of the Philippines. Aquino took residence in the , the first president to do so, instead of the Malacañang Palace, which has been the official residence of his predecessors.
Aquino announced the formation of a truth commission that would investigate various issues including corruption allegations against his predecessor President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo with former Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. as commission head.

Aquino took the oath of office on June 30, 2010, at the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park, Manila. The oath of office was administered by Associate Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales, who officially accepted Aquino&#x27;s request to swear him into office, reminiscent of the decision of his mother, who in 1986, was sworn into the presidency by Associate Justice Claudio Teehankee. After being sworn in as the fifteenth president of the Philippines, succeeding Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Aquino delivered his .

During Aquino&#x27;s (SONA) on July 26, 2010, Aquino announced his intention to reform the education system in the Philippines by shifting to K–12 education, a 12-year basic education cycle.

===Domestic policy===
====No &quot;wang wang&quot; policy====
During the inaugural address, Aquino created the &quot;no &quot;wang-wang&quot;&quot; policy, strengthening the implementation of Presidential Decree No. 96. &quot;Wang-wang&quot; is colloquial term for blaring sirens. The decree was issued on January 13, 1973, by then President Ferdinand Marcos, regulating the use of sirens and other similar devices only to motor vehicles designated for the use of select national government officials, the police, the military, the fire department and ambulances. Despite having the privilege of using &quot;wang-wang&quot; as president, Aquino refrained from using sirens to set up an example for his policy, even if it means being stuck in traffic and being late every now and then. After the inaugural address, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority began to enforce Aquino&#x27;s no &quot;wang-wang&quot; policy, confiscating &quot;wang-wang&quot; from public officials and private motorists who illegally used them.

====Bangsamoro peace process====
Aquino resumed stalled peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a rebel group in Mindanao seeking self-determination for Moros. He met with the MILF in Tokyo, Japan in August 2011 to initiate peace talks which resulted to the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro between the Philippine government and the rebel group the following year. The agreement started the process of replacing the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) with a new political entity. In 2014, the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) was signed between the Philippine government and the MILF, with the deal characterized as a &quot;final peace agreement&quot; between the two parties.

The CAB paved way for the drafting of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL; later known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law or BOL), a charter for a proposed Bangsamoro autonomous region which would replace the ARMM.

In 2015, President Aquino was accused of evading responsibility for the Mamasapano clash, a botched police operation, which resulted to the death of 44 Special Action Force officers. He was also criticized for entrusting the operation to suspended police chief Alan Purisima. This led to a decrease of public support for the BBL.

====Education====
Aquino introduced reforms on the Philippine education program by introducing the K-12 curriculum by signing into law the Enhanced Basic Education Act in 2013. This added two years to the basic education system; which became known as the Senior High School stage. The program was introduced because the Philippines was among the three countries in the world at that time still had a 10-year basic education program. Among the criticisms of the K-12 program is the associated costs to be shouldered by teachers, parents, and students for the additional two years of basic education as well as the lack of classrooms and teachers required for the implementation of the shift to K-12.

===Foreign policy===
Benigno Aquino III is noted for his confrontational foreign policy against China, especially concerning the Philippines&#x27; approach in pursuing its claims in the South China Sea. It was under his administration, that the &quot;China v. Philippines&quot; case was filed in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) which ruled in 2016 the invalidity of China&#x27;s nine-dash line claim which covers the entire sea, although China continues to disregard the decision. The case was filed in 2013, after the Philippines lost control of the Scarborough Shoal after the 2012 standoff with China over the dispute feature. He is also responsible for instituting the term &quot;West Philippine Sea&quot; in 2012 for the eastern parts of the South China Sea which the Philippines claims to be part of its exclusive economic zone.

=== Administration and cabinet ===
=== Judicial appointments ===
Aquino appointed the following to the Supreme Court of the Philippines:
* Maria Lourdes Sereno – August 13, 2010 (as Associate Justice); August 25, 2012 (as Chief Justice).
* Bienvenido L. Reyes – August 16, 2011
* Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe – September 16, 2011
* Mario Victor F. Leonen – November 21, 2012
* Francis H. Jardeleza – August 19, 2014
* Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa – January 22, 2016

=== Criticism ===
==== Manila hostage crisis ====
On August 23, 2010, in front of the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park, Manila, the Manila hostage crisis occurred when a gunman took hostage a bus with Hong Kong tourists. Aquino defended the actions of the police at the scene, stating that the gunman had not shown any signs of wanting to kill the hostages. Aquino ordered a &quot;thorough investigation&quot; into the incident, and would wait until it is completed before deciding whether anyone should lose his or her job. Aquino declared that the media may have worsened the situation by giving the gunman &quot;a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the entire situation&quot;. Aquino also made reference to the Moscow theater hostage crisis, which, according to Aquino, resulted in &quot;more severe&quot; casualties despite Russia&#x27;s &quot;resources and sophistication&quot;. On August 24, 2010, Aquino signed Proclamation No. 23, declaring August 25, 2010, as a national day of mourning, instructing all public institutions nationwide and all Philippine embassies and consulates overseas to lower the Philippine flag at half-mast, in honor of the eight Hong Kong residents who died during the crisis. On August 25, 2010, at a press conference in Malacañang, Aquino apologized to those offended when he was caught on television apparently smiling while being interviewed at the crime scene hours after the Manila hostage crisis. Aquino said:

On September 3, 2010, Aquino took responsibility for the crisis. Aquino actually has direct supervision of the Philippine National Police, since Aquino had asked Secretary of the Interior and Local Government Jesse Robredo to address other concerns, such as coming up with a comprehensive plan on delivering social services to and relocating informal settlers in coordination with the local governments. No formal apology for the crisis was made by Aquino until President Rodrigo Duterte formally apologized in 2018 as president of the Republic of the Philippines and in behalf of the people of the Philippines.

==== Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) ====
President Aquino&#x27;s administration was criticized during and after Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in November 2013 for the government&#x27;s &quot;slow&quot; response to aid the victims. This criticism resulted in countries like Canada providing humanitarian aid to the victims of the typhoon through non-governmental organizations and not the Philippine government.

==== Noynoying ====

&quot;Noynoying&quot; (pronounced noy-noy-YING or noy-NOY-ying) was a protest tactic in the form of a neologism that Aquino&#x27;s critics used to question his work ethic, alleging his inaction on the issues of disaster response and rising oil prices. A play on the term planking and Aquino&#x27;s nickname, Noynoying involved posing in a lazy manner, such as sitting idly while resting his head on one hand, and doing nothing.

== Post-presidency (2016–2021) ==
Following the turnover ceremonies to his successor Rodrigo Duterte at Malacañang, Aquino returned to his parents&#x27; residence along Times Street, Quezon City. After leaving office, Aquino remained silent on the Duterte administration and rarely made public appearances. However, in November 2016, Aquino attended a concert at Rizal Park and joined protests against the burial of Ferdinand Marcos. In February 2017, Aquino commemorated the 31st anniversary of the People Power Revolution by marching to the People Power Monument and joining the protests against the Ferdinand Marcos regime.

=== Legal charges ===
In July 2017, criminal charges were filed against Aquino for usurpation of authority under the Revised Penal Code and violating anti-graft and corruption laws. Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales cited the involvement of then suspended Philippine National Police chief Alan Purisima in the 2015 Mamasapano police operation against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, where 44 Special Action Force members were killed. Under the Revised Penal Code, suspended public officials cannot perform their duties or interfere in government affairs. Aquino&#x27;s former deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said that Aquino planned to file a motion for reconsideration to appeal the charges. In 2018, Aquino was indicted in a $1.35-billion criminal case involving a congressional approval to use state funds on major government projects. On August 22, 2019, the Sandiganbayan dropped the charges against Aquino upon request from Ombudsman Samuel Martires, citing the rule that no president can be charged of inducing subordinates to follow orders.

== Personal life ==
Aquino never married and had no children, making him the Philippines&#x27; first bachelor president. Aquino previously had a relationship with Shalani Soledad, a Valenzuela city councilor and niece of former Senator Francisco Tatad. In November 2010, Aquino confirmed that he and Soledad had ended their relationship. He had previously dated Korina Sanchez, Bernadette Sembrano, and Liz Uy. He was also in a relationship with Korean television host Grace Lee. Aquino had openly stated that he preferred younger women because he wanted to have children.

Aquino was an enthusiast of shooting, billiards, and video games. He was also engaged in martial arts, particularly karate and sikaran. Aquino did not drink alcoholic beverages but was a chain smoker. He said that he was not keen on being a poster boy for anti-smoking campaigns. Upon winning the election, Aquino received a phone call from U.S. President Barack Obama, who congratulated him and offered assistance to smoking cessation.

Although his official residence as president was Malacañang Palace, Aquino chose to reside in the Bahay Pangarap (Dream House), located within the Palace grounds, while in office.

== Illness and death ==
Speculation surrounding Aquino&#x27;s health began circulating in August 2019 after he was unable to attend the commemoration of his late father&#x27;s 36th death anniversary; however, his spokesperson Abigail Valte said that his illness then was &quot;nothing serious&quot;. In November 2019, Aquino was reported to have suffered from pneumonia. A month after, he was confined at Makati Medical Center for an executive checkup and undisclosed routine procedures. Aquino was confined in an intensive care unit, although according to his spokesperson, he was never in critical condition and the accommodation was just to limit visitors. Senator Francis Pangilinan, who was Aquino&#x27;s former food security czar, later stated that this confinement was due to a kidney malfunction. Pangilinan added that Aquino had also been suffering from hypertension and diabetes. Thereafter, Aquino regularly sought medical treatment for his condition. By May 2021, Aquino told Camille Elemia of Rappler that he was experiencing a loss of appetite and breathing difficulties. That same month, he reportedly underwent a cardiac surgery.

In the early hours of June 24, 2021, Aquino was found by his maidservant lying unconscious on his recliner at his home in West Triangle, Quezon City. He was immediately transported by ambulance to the nearby Capitol Medical Center in Diliman, where he was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. (PHT), that day (22:30 UTC of the previous day). The cause of death was stated as renal disease, secondary to diabetes. According to his personal chauffeur, Aquino was scheduled to undergo dialysis on June 21, but refused because he felt that his body was &quot;weak&quot;. Another dialysis was planned the day prior to his death, but Aquino again turned it down for similar reasons. Aquino&#x27;s former public works secretary, Rogelio Singson, stated that he also underwent angioplasty to prepare for a scheduled kidney transplantation; Aquino was in the process of searching for donors at the time of his death.

His remains were cremated on the day of his death and his ashes were buried adjacent to that of his parents at the Manila Memorial Park in Parañaque on June 26, making him the first Philippine president to have been initially cremated. Three Masses were held on June 25–26 at the Church of the Gesù at his alma mater, the Ateneo de Manila University, where a public viewing was also held. Then newly-installed Manila Archbishop Jose Advincula blessed his remains, while his funeral mass was presided over by Lingayen–Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas (who also presided the requiem mass for Aquino&#x27;s mother in 2009 when Villegas was Bishop of Balanga), with Kalookan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David concelebrating.

A few hours after the announcement of Aquino&#x27;s death, President Rodrigo Duterte declared a ten-day &quot;period of national mourning&quot; from June 24 to July 3. All national flags were flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning.

The funeral rites of Aquino were covered by Radyo Katipunan, the radio arm of his alma mater, for the wake and Radio Television Malacañang for his burial.

<text>The Data Protection Directive, officially Directive 95/46/EC, enacted in October 1995, was a European Union directive which regulated the processing of personal data within the European Union (EU) and the free movement of such data. The Data Protection Directive was an important component of EU privacy and human rights law.

The principles set out in the Data Protection Directive were aimed at the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms in the processing of personal data. The General Data Protection Regulation, adopted in April 2016, superseded the Data Protection Directive and became enforceable on 25 May 2018.

==Context==
The right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in Europe. All the member states of the Council of Europe (CoE) are also signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one&#x27;s &quot;private and family life, his home and his correspondence&quot;, subject to certain restrictions. The European Court of Human Rights has given this article a very broad interpretation in its jurisprudence.

In 1973, American scholar Willis Ware published &quot;Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens&quot;, a report that was to be influential on the directions these laws would take.

In 1980, in an effort to create a comprehensive data protection system throughout Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued its &quot;Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data&quot;. The seven principles governing the OECD&#x27;s recommendations for protection of personal data were:
# Notice—data subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected;
# Purpose—data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes;
# Consent—data should not be disclosed without the data subject&#x27;s consent;
# Security—collected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses;
# Disclosure—data subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data;
# Access—data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data
# Accountability—data subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable for not following the above principles.

The OECD Guidelines, however, were non-binding, and data privacy laws still varied widely across Europe. The United States, meanwhile, while endorsing the OECD&#x27;s recommendations, did nothing to implement them within the United States. However, the first six principles were incorporated into the EU Directive.

In 1981, the Members States of the Council of Europe adopted the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) to implement Article 8 of the ECHR. Convention 108 obliges the signatories to enact legislation concerning the automatic processing of personal data, and was modernised and reinforced in 2018 to become &quot;Convention 108+&quot;.

In 1989 with German reunification, the data the East German secret police (Stasi) collected became well known, increasing the demand for privacy in Germany. At the time West Germany already had privacy laws since 1977 (). The European Commission realized that diverging data protection legislation amongst EU member states impeded the free flow of data within the EU and accordingly proposed the Data Protection Directive.

==Content==
The directive regulates the processing of personal data regardless of whether such processing is automated or not.

===Scope===
&quot;Personal data&quot; are defined as &quot;any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&#x27;data subject&#x27;); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity&quot; (art. 2 a).

This definition is meant to be very broad. Data are &quot;personal data&quot; when someone is able to link the information to a person, even if the person holding the data cannot make this link. Some examples of &quot;personal data&quot; are: address, credit card number, bank statements, criminal record, etc.

The notion &quot;processing&quot; means &quot;any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction&quot; (art. 2 b).

The responsibility for compliance rests on the shoulders of the &quot;controller&quot;, meaning the natural or artificial person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (art. 2 d).

The data protection rules are applicable not only when the controller is established within the EU, but whenever the controller uses equipment situated within the EU in order to process data. (art. 4) Controllers from outside the EU, processing data in the EU, will have to follow data protection regulation. In principle, any online business trading with EU residents would process some personal data and would be using equipment in the EU to process the data (i.e. the customer&#x27;s computer). As a consequence, the website operator would have to comply with the European data protection rules. The directive was written before the breakthrough of the Internet, and to date there is little jurisprudence on this subject.

===Principles===
Personal data should not be processed at all, except when certain conditions are met. These conditions fall into three categories: transparency, legitimate purpose, and proportionality.

====Transparency====
The data subject has the right to be informed when his personal data is being processed. The controller must provide his name and address, the purpose of processing, the recipients of the data and all other information required to ensure the processing is fair. (art. 10 and 11)

Data may be processed only if at least one of the following is true (art. 7):
* when the data subject has given his consent.
* when the processing is necessary for the performance of or the entering into a contract.
* when processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
* when processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject.
* processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed.
* processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are over-ridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The data subject has the right to access all data processed about him. The data subject even has the right to demand the rectification, deletion or blocking of data that is incomplete, inaccurate or not being processed in compliance with the data protection rules. (art. 12)

====Legitimate purpose====
Personal data can only be processed for specified explicit and legitimate purposes and may not be processed further in a way incompatible with those purposes. (art. 6 b) The personal data must have protection from misuse and respect for the &quot;certain rights of the data owners which are guaranteed by EU law&quot;.

====Proportionality====
Personal data may be processed only insofar as it is adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed.
The data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that data which are inaccurate or incomplete, having regard to the purposes for which they were collected or for which they are further processed, are erased or rectified;
The data shouldn&#x27;t be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. Member States shall lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use. (art. 6).

When sensitive personal data (can be: religious beliefs, political opinions, health, sexual orientation, race, membership of past organisations) are being processed, extra restrictions apply. (art. 8).

The data subject may object at any time to the processing of personal data for the purpose of direct marketing. (art. 14)

An algorithmic-based decision which produces legal effects or significantly affects the data subject may not be based solely on automated processing of data. (art. 15) A form of appeal should be provided when automatic decision making processes are used.

===Supervisory authority and the public register of processing operations===
Each member state must set up a supervisory authority, an independent body that will monitor the data protection level in that member state, give advice to the government about administrative measures and regulations, and start legal proceedings when data protection regulation has been violated. (art. 28) Individuals may lodge complaints about violations to the supervisory authority or in a court of law.

The controller must notify the supervisory authority before he starts to process data. The notification contains at least the following information (art. 19):
* the name and address of the controller and of his representative, if any;
* the purpose or purposes of the processing;
* a description of the category or categories of data subject and of the data or categories of data relating to them;
* the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the data might be disclosed;
* proposed transfers of data to third countries;
* a general description of the measures taken to ensure security of processing.
This information is kept in a public register.

===Transfer of personal data to third countries===
&quot;Third countries&quot; is the term used in legislation to designate countries outside the European Union.
Personal data may only be transferred to a third country if that country provides an adequate level of protection of the data. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller himself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.

The Directive&#x27;s Article 29 created the &quot;Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Article 29 Working Party&quot;. The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.

The Working Party negotiated with United States representatives about the protection of personal data, the Safe Harbour Principles were the result. According to critics the Safe Harbour Principles do not provide for an adequate level of protection, because they contain fewer obligations for the controller and allow the contractual waiver of certain rights.

In October 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled that the Safe Harbour regime was invalid as a result of an action brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner in relation to the export of subscribers&#x27; data by Facebook&#x27;s European business to Facebook in the United States. The US and European Authorities worked on a replacement for Safe Harbour and an agreement was reached in February 2016, leading to the European Commission adopting the EU–US Privacy Shield framework on 12 July 2016. This was likewise found invalid in 2020 and replaced with the EU–US Data Privacy Framework in 2023.

In July 2007, a new, controversial, passenger name record (PNR) agreement between the US and the EU was undersigned.

In February 2008, Jonathan Faull, the head of the EU&#x27;s Commission of Home Affairs, complained about the United States bilateral policy concerning PNR. The US had signed in February 2008 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Czech Republic in exchange of a visa waiver scheme, without first consulting Brussels. The tensions between Washington and Brussels are mainly caused by the lower level of data protection in the US, especially since foreigners do not benefit from the US Privacy Act of 1974. Other countries approached for bilateral Memoranda of Understanding included the United Kingdom, Estonia, (Germany) and Greece.

==Implementation by the member states==
EU directives are addressed to the member states, and are not legally binding for individuals in principle. The member states must transpose the directive into internal law.
Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data had to be transposed by the end of 1998. All member states had enacted their own data protection legislation.

==Replacement by the General Data Protection Regulation==
On 25 January 2012, the European Commission (EC) announced it would be unifying data protection law across a unified European Union via legislation called the &quot;General Data Protection Regulation.&quot; The EC&#x27;s objectives with this legislation included:

* the harmonisation of 27 national data protection regulations into one unified regulation;
* the improvement of corporate data transfer rules outside the European Union; and
* the improvement of user control over personal identifying data.

The original proposal also dictated that the legislation would in theory &quot;apply for all non-EU companies without any establishment in the EU, provided that the processing of data is directed at EU residents,&quot; one of the biggest changes with the new legislation. This change carried on through to the legislation&#x27;s final approval on 14 April 2016, affecting entities around the world. &quot;The Regulation applies to processing outside the EU that relates to the offering of goods or services to data subjects (individuals) in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior,&quot; according to W. Scott Blackmer of the InfoLawGroup, though he added &quot;[i]t is questionable whether European supervisory authorities or consumers would actually try to sue US-based operators over violations of the Regulation.&quot; Additional changes include stricter conditions for consent, broader definition of sensitive data, new provisions on protecting children&#x27;s privacy, and the inclusion of &quot;rights to be forgotten.&quot;

The EC then set a compliance date of 25 May 2018, giving businesses around the world a chance to prepare for compliance, review data protection language in contracts, consider transition to international standards, update privacy policies, and review marketing plans.

==Comparison with other jurisdictions==
===Comparison with United States data protection law===
, the United States has no single data protection law comparable to the EU&#x27;s Data Protection Directive.

United States privacy legislation tends to be adopted on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, with legislation arising when certain sectors and circumstances require (e.g., the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988, the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA (US)). Therefore, while certain sectors may already satisfy parts of the EU Directive most do not. The United States prefers what it calls a &#x27;sectoral&#x27; approach to data protection legislation, which relies on a combination of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation, rather than governmental regulation alone. Former US President Bill Clinton and former Vice-President Al Gore explicitly recommended in their &quot;Framework for Global Electronic Commerce&quot; that the private sector should lead, and companies should implement self-regulation in reaction to issues brought on by Internet technology.

The reasoning behind this approach has as much to do with American laissez-faire economics as with different social perspectives. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. While free speech is an explicit right guaranteed by the United States Constitution, privacy is an implicit right guaranteed by the Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, although it is often an explicit right in many state constitutions.

Europe&#x27;s extensive privacy regulation is justified with reference to experiences under World War II-era fascist governments and post-War Communist regimes, where there was widespread unchecked use of personal information. World War II and the post-War period was a time in Europe when disclosure of race or ethnicity led to secret denunciations and seizures that sent friends and neighbours to work camps and concentration camps. In the age of computers, Europeans&#x27; guardedness of secret government files has translated into a distrust of corporate databases, and governments in Europe took decided steps to protect personal information from abuses in the years following World War II. (Germany) and France, in particular, set forth comprehensive data protection laws.

Critics of Europe&#x27;s data policies, however, have said that they have impeded Europe&#x27;s ability to monetize the data of users on the internet and are the primary reason why there are no Big Tech companies in Europe, with most of them instead being in the United States. Furthermore, with Alibaba and Tencent joining the ranks of the world&#x27;s 10 most valuable tech companies in recent years, even China is moving ahead of Europe in the performance of its digital economy, which was valued at $5.09 trillion in 2019 (35.8 trillion yuan).

Meanwhile, Europe&#x27;s preoccupation with the US is likely misplaced in the first place, as China and Russia are increasingly identified by European policymakers as &quot;hybrid threat&quot; aggressors, using a combination of propaganda on social media and hacking to intentionally undermine the functioning of European institutions.

<doc id="279651" wikidata="Q864472" url="?curid=279651" title="Truncated tetrahedron">
<text>In geometry, the truncated tetrahedron is an Archimedean solid. It has 4 regular hexagonal faces, 4 equilateral triangle faces, 12 vertices and 18 edges (of two types). It can be constructed by truncating all 4 vertices of a regular tetrahedron.

== Construction ==
The truncated tetrahedron can be constructed from a regular tetrahedron by cutting all of its vertices off, a process known as truncation. The resulting polyhedron has 4 equilateral triangles and 4 regular hexagons, 18 edges, and 12 vertices. With edge length 1, the Cartesian coordinates of the 12 vertices are points

formula_1

that have an even number of minus signs.

== Properties ==
Given the edge length formula_2. The surface area of a truncated tetrahedron formula_3 is the sum of 4 regular hexagons and 4 equilateral triangles&#x27; area, and its volume formula_4 is:
formula_5

The dihedral angle of a truncated tetrahedron between triangle-to-hexagon is approximately 109.47°, and that between adjacent hexagonal faces is approximately 70.53°.

The densest packing of the truncated tetrahedron is believed to be formula_6, as reported by two independent groups using Monte Carlo methods by and . Although no mathematical proof exists that this is the best possible packing for the truncated tetrahedron, the high proximity to the unity and independence of the findings make it unlikely that an even denser packing is to be found. If the truncation of the corners is slightly smaller than that of a truncated tetrahedron, this new shape can be used to fill space completely.
The truncated tetrahedron is an Archimedean solid, meaning it is a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron, and two or more different regular polygonal faces meet in a vertex. The truncated tetrahedron has the same three-dimensional group symmetry as the regular tetrahedron, the tetrahedral symmetry formula_7. The polygonal faces that meet for every vertex are one equilateral triangle and two regular hexagons, and the vertex figure is denoted as formula_8. Its dual polyhedron is triakis tetrahedron, a Catalan solid, shares the same symmetry as the truncated tetrahedron.

== Related polyhedrons ==
The truncated tetrahedron can be found in the construction of polyhedrons. For example, the augmented truncated tetrahedron is a Johnson solid constructed from a truncated tetrahedron by attaching triangular cupola onto its hexagonal face. The triakis truncated tetrahedron is a polyhedron constructed from a truncated tetrahedron by adding three tetrahedrons onto its triangular faces, as interpreted by the name &quot;triakis&quot;. It is classified as plesiohedron, meaning it can tessellate in three-dimensional space known as honeycomb; an example is triakis truncated tetrahedral honeycomb.

The &quot;Friauf polyhedron&quot; is named after J. B. Friauf in which he described it as a intermetallic structure formed by a compound of metallic elements. It can be found in crystals such as complex metallic alloys, an example is dizinc magnesium MgZn2. It is a lower symmetry version of the truncated tetrahedron, interpreted as a truncated tetragonal disphenoid with its three-dimensional symmetry group as the dihedral group formula_9 of order 8.

Truncating a truncated tetrahedron gives the resulting polyhedron 54 edges, 32 vertices, and 20 faces—4 hexagons, 4 nonagons, and 12 trapeziums. This polyhedron was used by Adidas as the underlying geometry of the Jabulani ball designed for the 2010 World Cup.

==Truncated tetrahedral graph==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a truncated tetrahedral graph is an Archimedean graph, the graph of vertices and edges of the truncated tetrahedron, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 12 vertices and 18 edges. It is a connected cubic graph, and connected cubic transitive graph.

<text>In geometry, the truncated octahedron is the Archimedean solid that arises from a regular octahedron by removing six pyramids, one at each of the octahedron&#x27;s vertices. The truncated octahedron has 14 faces (8 regular hexagons and 6 squares), 36 edges, and 24 vertices. Since each of its faces has point symmetry the truncated octahedron is a 6-zonohedron. It is also the Goldberg polyhedron GIV(1,1), containing square and hexagonal faces. Like the cube, it can tessellate (or &quot;pack&quot;) 3-dimensional space, as a permutohedron.

The truncated octahedron was called the &quot;mecon&quot; by Buckminster Fuller.

Its dual polyhedron is the tetrakis hexahedron. If the original truncated octahedron has unit edge length, its dual tetrakis hexahedron has edge lengths and .

== Classifications ==
=== As an Archimedean solid ===
A truncated octahedron is constructed from a regular octahedron by cutting off all vertices. This resulting polyhedron has six squares and eight hexagons, leaving out six square pyramids. Setting the edge length of the regular octahedron equal to formula_1, it follows that the length of each edge of a square pyramid (to be removed) is formula_2 (the square pyramid is has four equilateral triangles as faces, the first Johnson solid). From the equilateral square pyramid&#x27;s property, its volume is formula_3. Because six equilateral square pyramids are removed by truncation, the volume of a truncated octahedron formula_4 is obtained by subtracting the volume of those six from that of a regular octahedron:
formula_5
The surface area of a truncated octahedron can be obtained by summing all polygonals&#x27; area, six squares and eight hexagons. Considering the edge length formula_2, this is:
formula_7
The truncated octahedron is one of the thirteen Archimedean solids. In other words, it has a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron with two or more different regular polygonal faces that meet in a vertex. The dual polyhedron of a truncated octahedron is the tetrakis hexahedron. They both have the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the regular octahedron does, the octahedral symmetry formula_8. A square and two hexagons surround each of its vertex, denoting its vertex figure as formula_9.

The dihedral angle of a truncated octahedron between square-to-hexagon is formula_10, and that between adjacent hexagonal faces is formula_11.

The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a truncated octahedron with edge length 1 are all permutations of
formula_12

=== As a space-filling polyhedron ===

The truncated octahedron can be described as a permutohedron of order 4 or 4-permutohedron, meaning it can be represented with even more symmetric coordinates in four dimensions: all permutations of formula_13 form the vertices of a truncated octahedron in the three-dimensional subspace formula_14. Therefore, each vertex corresponds to a permutation of formula_13 and each edge represents a single pairwise swap of two elements. With this labeling, the swaps are of elements whose values differ by one. If, instead, the truncated octahedron is labeled by the inverse permutations, the edges correspond to swaps of elements whose positions differ by one. With this alternative labeling, the edges and vertices of the truncated octahedron form the Cayley graph of the symmetric group formula_16, the group of four-element permtutations, as generated by swaps of consecutive positions.

The truncated octahedron can tile space. It is classified as plesiohedron, meaning it can be defined as the Voronoi cell of a symmetric Delone set. Plesiohedra, translated without rotating, can be repeated to fill space. There are five three-dimensional primary parallelohedrons, one of which is the truncated octahedron. More generally, every permutohedron and parallelohedron is a zonohedron, a polyhedron that is centrally symmetric and can be defined by a Minkowski sum.

== Applications ==
In chemistry, the truncated octahedron is the sodalite cage structure in the framework of a faujasite-type of zeolite crystals.

In solid-state physics, the first Brillouin zone of the face-centered cubic lattice is a truncated octahedron.

The truncated octahedron (in fact, the generalized truncated octahedron) appears in the error analysis of quantization index modulation (QIM) in conjunction with repetition coding.

== Dissection ==
The truncated octahedron can be dissected into a central octahedron, surrounded by 8 triangular cupolae on each face, and 6 square pyramids above the vertices.
Removing the central octahedron and 2 or 4 triangular cupolae creates two Stewart toroids, with dihedral and tetrahedral symmetry:

It is possible to slice a tesseract by a hyperplane so that its sliced cross-section is a truncated octahedron.

The cell-transitive bitruncated cubic honeycomb can also be seen as the Voronoi tessellation of the body-centered cubic lattice. The truncated octahedron is one of five three-dimensional primary parallelohedra.

== Truncated octahedral graph ==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a truncated octahedral graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the truncated octahedron. It has 24 vertices and 36 edges, and is a cubic Archimedean graph. It has book thickness 3 and queue number 2.

As a Hamiltonian cubic graph, it can be represented by LCF notation in multiple ways: [3, −7, 7, −3]6, [5, −11, 11, 7, 5, −5, −7, −11, 11, −5, −7, 7]2, and [−11, 5, −3, −7, −9, 3, −5, 5, −3, 9, 7, 3, −5, 11, −3, 7, 5, −7, −9, 9, 7, −5, −7, 3].

<text>James Gillray (13 August 1756 1June 1815) was a British caricaturist and printmaker famous for his etched political and social satires, mainly published between 1792 and 1810. Many of his works are held at the National Portrait Gallery in London.

Gillray has been called &quot;the father of the political cartoon&quot;, with his works satirizing George III, Napoleon, prime ministers and generals. Regarded as one of the two most influential cartoonists, the other being William Hogarth, Gillray&#x27;s wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.

== Early life ==
He was born in Chelsea, London. His father had served as a soldier; he had lost an arm at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 and was admitted, first as an inmate and subsequently as an outdoor pensioner, at Chelsea Hospital. Gillray commenced life by learning letter-engraving, at which he soon became adept. Finding this employment irksome, he then wandered for a time with a company of strolling players. After a chequered experience, he returned to London and was admitted as a student in the Royal Academy, supporting himself by engraving, and probably issuing a considerable number of caricatures under fictitious names.

His caricatures are almost all in etching, some also with aquatint, and a few using stipple technique. None can correctly be described as engravings, although this term is often loosely used to describe them. Hogarth&#x27;s works were the delight and study of his early years. &quot;Paddy on Horseback&quot;, which appeared in 1779, is the first caricature which is certainly his. Two caricatures on Admiral Rodney&#x27;s naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes, issued in 1782, were among the first of the memorable series of his political sketches.

== Adult life ==
The name of Gillray&#x27;s publisher and print seller, Hannah Humphrey – whose shop was first at 227 Strand, then in New Bond Street, then in Old Bond Street, and finally in St James&#x27;s Street – is inextricably associated with that of the caricaturist himself. Gillray lived with Miss (often called Mrs) Humphrey during the entire period of his fame. It is believed that he several times thought of marrying her, and that on one occasion the pair were on their way to the church, when Gillray said: &quot;This is a foolish affair, methinks, Miss Humphrey. We live very comfortably together; we had better let well alone.&quot; There is no evidence, however, to support the stories which scandalmongers invented about their relationship. One of Gillray&#x27;s prints, &quot;Twopenny Whist&quot;, is a depiction of four individuals playing cards, and the character shown second from the left, an ageing lady with eyeglasses and a bonnet, is widely believed to be an accurate depiction of Miss Humphrey.

Gillray&#x27;s plates were exposed in Humphrey&#x27;s shop window, where eager crowds examined them. One of his later prints, &quot;Very Slippy-Weather&quot;, shows Miss Humphrey&#x27;s shop in St. James&#x27;s Street in the background. In the shop window a number of Gillray&#x27;s previously published prints, such as &quot;Tiddy-Doll the Great French Gingerbread Maker, Drawing Out a New Batch of Kings; His Man, Talley Mixing up the Dough&quot;, a satire on Napoleon&#x27;s king-making proclivities, are shown in the shop window.
Gillray&#x27;s eyesight began to fail in 1806. He began wearing spectacles but they were unsatisfactory. Unable to work to his previous high standards, James Gillray became depressed and started drinking heavily. He produced his last print in September 1809. As a result of his heavy drinking Gillray suffered from gout throughout his later life.

His last work, from a design by Bunbury, is entitled &quot;Interior of a Barber&#x27;s Shop in Assize Time&quot;, and is dated 1811. While he was engaged on it he became mad, although he had occasional intervals of sanity, which he employed on his last work. The approach of madness may have been hastened by his intemperate habits.

In July 1811 Gillray attempted to kill himself by jumping out of an attic window above Humphrey&#x27;s shop in St James&#x27;s Street. Gillray lapsed into insanity and was looked after by Hannah Humphrey until his death on 1 June 1815 in London; he was buried in St James&#x27;s churchyard, Piccadilly.

== The art of caricature ==

A number of his most trenchant satires are directed against George III, who, after examining some of Gillray&#x27;s sketches, said &quot;I don&#x27;t understand these caricatures.&quot; Gillray revenged himself for this utterance by his caricature entitled &quot;A Connoisseur Examining a Cooper&quot;, which he is doing by means of a candle on a &quot;save-all&quot;, so that the sketch satirises at once the king&#x27;s pretensions to knowledge of art and his miserly habits.

During the French Revolution, Gillray took a conservative stance, and he issued caricature after caricature ridiculing the French and Napoleon (usually using Jacobin) and glorifying John Bull. A number of these were published in the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot;. He is not, however, to be thought of as a keen political adherent of either the Whig or the Tory party; his caricatures satirized members of all sides of the political spectrum.

The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray&#x27;s incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists. He is distinguished in the history of caricature by the fact that his sketches are real works of art. The ideas embodied in some of them are sublime and poetically magnificent in their intensity of meaning, while the forthrightness — which some have called coarseness — which others display is characteristic of the general freedom of treatment common in all intellectual departments in the 18th century. The historical value of Gillray&#x27;s work has been recognized by many discerning students of history. As has been well remarked: &quot;Lord Stanhope has turned Gillray to account as a veracious reporter of speeches, as well as a suggestive illustrator of events.&quot;
His contemporary political influence is borne witness to in a letter from Lord Bateman, dated 3 November 1798. &quot;The Opposition&quot;, he writes to Gillray, &quot;are as low as we can wish them. You have been of infinite service in lowering them, and making them ridiculous.&quot; Gillray&#x27;s extraordinary industry may be inferred from the fact that nearly 1000 caricatures have been attributed to him; while some consider him the author of as many as 1600 or 1700. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;Gillray is as invaluable to the student of English manners as to the political student, attacking the social follies of the time with scathing satire; and nothing escapes his notice, not even a trifling change of fashion in dress. The great tact Gillray displays in hitting on the ludicrous side of any subject is only equalled by the exquisite finish of his sketches—the finest of which reach an epic grandeur and Miltonic sublimity of conception.&quot;

Gillray&#x27;s caricatures are generally divided into two classes, the political series and the social, though it is important not to attribute to the term &quot;series&quot; any concept of continuity or completeness. The political caricatures comprise an important and invaluable component of the history extant of the latter part of the reign of George III. They were circulated not only in Britain but also throughout Europe, and exerted a powerful influence both in Britain and abroad. In the political prints, George III, George&#x27;s wife Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales (later prince regent, then King George IV), Fox, Pitt the Younger, Burke and Napoleon Bonaparte are the most prominent figures.

In 1788, appeared two fine caricatures by Gillray. &quot;Blood on Thunder fording the Red Sea&quot; represents Lord Thurlow carrying Warren Hastings through a sea of gore: Hastings looks very comfortable, and is carrying two large bags of money. &quot;Market-Day&quot; pictures the ministerialists of the time as cattle for sale.

Among Gillray&#x27;s best satires on George III are: &quot;Farmer George and his Wife&quot;, two companion plates, in one of which the king is toasting muffins for breakfast, and in the other the queen is frying sprats; &quot;The Anti-Saccharites&quot;, where the royal pair propose to dispense with sugar, to the great horror of the family; &quot;A Connoisseur Examining a Cooper&quot;; the paired plates &quot;A Voluptuary under the Horrors of Digestion&quot; and &quot;Temperance enjoying a Frugal Meal&quot;, satirising the excesses of the Prince Regent (later George IV of the United Kingdom) and the miserliness of his father, George III of the United Kingdom respectively; &quot;Royal Affability&quot;; &quot;A Lesson in Apple Dumplings&quot;; and &quot;The Pigs Possessed&quot;.

Other political caricatures include: &quot;Britannia between Scylla and Charybdis&quot;, a picture in which Pitt, so often Gillray&#x27;s butt, figures in a favourable light; &quot;The Bridal Night&quot;; &quot;The Apotheosis of Hoche&quot;, which concentrates the excesses of the French Revolution in one view; &quot;The Nursery with Britannia reposing in Peace&quot;; &quot;The First Kiss these Ten Years&quot; (1803), another satire on the peace, which is said to have greatly amused Napoleon; &quot;The Hand-Writing upon the Wall&quot;; &quot;The Confederated Coalition&quot;, a swipe at the coalition which superseded the Addington ministry; &quot;Uncorking Old Sherry&quot;; &quot;The Plumb-pudding in danger&quot; (probably the best known political print ever published); &quot;Making Decent&quot;; &quot;Comforts of a Bed of Roses&quot;; &quot;View of the Hustings in Covent Garden&quot;; &quot;Phaethon Alarmed&quot;; and &quot;Pandora opening her Box&quot;.

As well as being blatant in his observations, Gillray could be incredibly subtle, and puncture vanity with a remarkably deft approach. The outstanding example of this is his print &quot;Fashionable Contrasts;—or—The Duchess&#x27;s little Shoe yeilding &quot;&quot; to the Magnitude of the Duke&#x27;s Foot&quot;. This was a devastating image aimed at the ridiculous sycophancy directed by the press towards Frederica Charlotte Ulrica, Duchess of York, and the supposed daintiness of her feet. The print showed only the feet and ankles of the Duke and Duchess of York, in an obviously copulatory position, with the Duke&#x27;s feet enlarged and the Duchess&#x27;s feet drawn very small. This print silenced forever the sycophancy of the press regarding the union of the Duke and Duchess.

The miscellaneous series of caricatures, although they have scarcely the historical importance of the political series, are more readily intelligible, and are even more amusing. Among the finest are: &quot;Shakespeare Sacrificed&quot;; &quot;Two-Penny Whist&quot; (which features an image of Hannah Humphrey); &quot;Oh that this too solid flesh would melt&quot;; &quot;Sandwich-Carrots&quot;; &quot;The Gout&quot;; &quot;Comfort to the Corns&quot;; &quot;Begone Dull Care&quot;; &quot;The Cow-Pock&quot;, which gives humorous expression to the popular dread of vaccination; &quot;Dilletanti Theatricals&quot;; and &quot;Harmony before Matrimony&quot; and &quot;Matrimonial Harmonics&quot;—two sketches in violent contrast to each other.

== Famous editions ==
A selection of Gillray&#x27;s works appeared in &quot;James Gillray: The Caricatures&quot; printed between 1818 and the mid-1820s and published by John Miller, Bridge Street and W. Blackwood, Edinburgh. Nine parts were released. The next edition was Thomas McLean&#x27;s, which was published with a key, in 1830.

In 1851 Henry George Bohn put out an edition, from the original plates in a handsome elephant folio, with coarser sketches—commonly known as the &quot;Suppressed Plates&quot;—being published in a separate volume. For this edition Thomas Wright and Robert Harding Evans wrote a commentary, a history of the times embraced by the caricatures. Many copies of the Bohn Edition have been broken up into individual sheets and passed off as originals (see Collecting below). Although the two volumes of the Bohn Edition are often represented as being a complete collection of Gillray&#x27;s works, this is not the case: for example, &quot;Doublûres of Characters&quot; is not included in either volume. This is most likely because this print was not published by Hannah Humphrey, but by John Wright for the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine&quot;.

The next edition, entitled &quot;The Works of James Gillray, the Caricaturist: with the Story of his Life and Times&quot; (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1874), was the work of Thomas Wright, and introduced Gillray to larger public. This edition, which is complete in one volume, contains two portraits of Gillray, and upwards of 400 illustrations.

== Influence ==

Gillray is still revered as one of the most influential political caricaturists of all time, and among the leading cartoonists on the political stage in the United Kingdom today, both Steve Bell and Martin Rowson acknowledge him as probably the most influential of all their predecessors in that particular arena . Professor David Taylor, a University of Toronto expert in political satire, stated in 2013, &quot;Without question, if the leading cartoonist back then—James Gillray—had depicted Rob Ford he would have been far more merciless than they are today.&quot;

Regarded as being one of the two most influential cartoonists, the other being William Hogarth, Gillray has been called the father of the political cartoon. The 20th-century New Zealander cartoonist David Low described Hogarth as the grandfather and Gillray the father of the political cartoon. The face of Court Flunkey from the 1980s/1990s British television satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; is a caricature of Gillray, intended as a homage to the father of political cartooning.

In the article titled &quot;A&quot; &quot;Rousseauian Reading of Gillray&#x27;s National Conveniences&quot; John Moores wrote, &quot;As National Conveniences and The Fashionable Mamma show, Gillray was interested in the ideas of Rousseau, his work was influenced by them, and, as later designs on revolution and radicalism indicate, he held Rousseau in higher regard than other revolutionary influences, using a Rousseauian technique of misspelling to place uncertainty in his depictions of Rousseau&#x27;s texts.&quot;

<text>Lemuel &quot;Francis&quot; Abbott (1760/61 – 5 December 1803) was an English portrait painter, famous for his painting of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson (currently hanging in the Terracotta Room of number 10 Downing Street) and for those of other naval officers and literary figures of the 18th century.

==Life==

He was born Lemuel Abbott in Leicestershire in 1760 or 1761, the son of clergyman Lemuel Abbott, curate of Anstey (and later vicar of Thornton) and his wife Mary. In 1775, at the age of 14, he became a pupil of Francis Hayman and lived in London, but returned to his parents after his teacher&#x27;s death in 1776. There he continued to develop his artistic talents independently, but some authorities have suggested that he may also have studied with Joseph Wright of Derby.

In 1780, Abbott married Anna Maria, and again settled in London, residing for many years in Caroline Street in Bloomsbury. Although he exhibited at the Royal Academy, he never became an Academician. It is said that overwork, due to the commissions he took on, and domestic unhappiness led to his becoming insane. He was declared insane in 1798, and was treated by Thomas Munro (1759–1833), the chief physician to Bethlem Hospital and a specialist in mental disorders – Munro also treated King George III (1738–1820).

Abbott died in London on 5 December 1803.

==Works==

Abbott painted portraits of many figures of the day. His 1797 portrait of Horatio Nelson was commenced during a period where both men were living in the same lodgings in London&#x27;s Bond Street. The finished work won the approval of both Nelson and his wife, with lady Nelson writing that &quot;[T]he likeliness is great; I am well pleased with Abbott.&quot; While the Nelson portrait was Abbott&#x27;s most famous work, other subjects of the period included Admiral Sir Robert Calder, Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley and Captain William Locker, astronomer Sir William Herschel, poet William Cowper, artists Francesco Bartolozzi and Joseph Nollekens, entrepreneur Matthew Boulton and industrialist John Wilkinson.

His portrait of Henry Callender, Captain General of the Royal Blackheath Golf Club, is one of the earliest portrayals of the game of golf. Reproductions hang in golf clubs the world over. It was sold at Bonhams in London on 9 December 2015.

Some of his paintings were signed &quot;Francis Lemuel Abbott&quot;, but it is not known why he assumed the additional Christian name, as it was not one with which he was baptised.
Other famous paintings include, that off one addressed as follows:
To the society of goffers at Blackheath this plate is with just respect Dedicated by their most humble servant, Lemuel Francis Abbott
It is signed painted by L.F.Abbott 1790.
It is reported to be that of a Captain William Innes and a pensioner.
Captain Innes was as the story goes, an avid fan of the society of goffers.

<doc id="279660" wikidata="Q155534" url="?curid=279660" title="Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly">
<text>Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly (; ; ; February 1559 – 30 April 1632) was a field marshal who commanded the Catholic League&#x27;s forces in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. From 1620 to 1631, he won an unmatched and demoralizing string of important victories against the Protestants, including White Mountain, Wimpfen, Höchst, Stadtlohn and the Conquest of the Palatinate. He destroyed a Danish army at Lutter and sacked the Protestant city of Magdeburg, which caused the deaths of some 20,000 of the city&#x27;s inhabitants, both defenders and non-combatants, out of a total population of 25,000. 

However, Tilly&#x27;s army was eventually crushed at Breitenfeld in 1631 by the Swedish army of King Gustavus Adolphus. A bullet from a Swedish arquebus mortally wounded him at the Battle of Rain on 15 April 1632, and he died two weeks later in Ingolstadt on 30 April 1632, at the age of 73. Along with Duke Albrecht von Wallenstein of Friedland and Mecklenburg, he was one of two chief commanders of the Holy Roman Empire’s forces during the first half of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Early years==

Johann Tserclaes was born on February 1559 in Castle Tilly, Walloon Brabant, in the Spanish Netherlands, in what is now Belgium, to a devoutly Catholic Brabantine family. After receiving a Jesuit education in Cologne, he joined the Spanish Army at the age of fifteen and fought under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma in his campaign against the rebellious Dutch forces during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, participating in the successful Siege of Antwerp in 1585. After this he joined the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s campaign against the Ottoman Turks in Hungary and the Transylvania as a mercenary during the Long Turkish War in 1600, and through rapid promotion became a field marshal in only five years. When the Turkish War ended in 1606, he remained in the service of Rudolf II in Prague until he was appointed commander of the Catholic League forces by Bavaria under Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria in 1610.

==Campaign in Bohemia==
As commander of the forces of the Catholic League, Tilly fought against the Bohemian rebels following the Defenestration of Prague, by which time he had trained his soldiers in the Spanish &quot;Tercio&quot; system, which featured musketeers supported by deep ranks of pikemen. A force of 25,000 soldiers, including troops of both the Catholic League and the Emperor scored an important victory against Christian of Anhalt and Count Thurn at the decisive Battle of White Mountain west of Prague on 8 November 1620. Half of the enemy forces were killed or captured, while the Catholic League lost only 700 men. This victory was vital in crushing resistance to the Emperor in Bohemia, as it allowed Prague to be captured several days later.

==Campaign in Germany==

Next, Tilly turned west and marched through Germany, but was defeated at the Battle of Mingolsheim on 27 April 1622. He then joined with the Spanish general Duke Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba – not to be confused with the famous Spanish general of the same name from the Italian Wars in Italy at the end of the 15th century – and was victorious at the Battle of Wimpfen against George Fredrick, Margrave of Baden-Durlach on 6 May; this victory occurred after the enemies’ ammunition tumbril was hit by cannon fire and exploded.

He was successful again at the Battle of Höchst on 20 June and was made a count (&quot;Graf&quot; in German) for this victory. These three battles in two months allowed him to capture the city of Heidelberg following an eleven-week siege on 19 September. Christian the Younger of Brunswick, whom he had already defeated at Höchst, raised another army, but again lost to him at the Battle of Stadtlohn, where 13,000 out of his army of 15,000 were lost, including fifty of his high-ranking officers. Together with the complete surrender of Bohemia in 1623, this ended virtually all resistance in Germany. This caused King Christian IV of Denmark to enter the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1625 to protect Protestantism, and also in a bid to make himself the primary leader of Northern Europe. Count Tilly besieged and captured Münden on 30 May 1626, whereupon local and refugee Protestant ministers were thrown into the river Werra, but could not lay a siege to Kassel. 

Tilly fought the Danes at the Battle of Lutter on 26–27 August 1626, in which his highly disciplined infantry charged the enemy lines four times, breaking through. This led him to win decisively, destroying more than half the fleeing Danish army, which was uncharacteristic of the warfare of the time. Denmark was forced to sue for peace at the Treaty of Lübeck. This disrupted the balance of power in Europe resulting in Swedish involvement in 1630 under their redoubtable leader, the brilliant King and field general Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who had been trying to dominate the Baltic for the previous ten years in wars with Poland, then a continental power of note.

==Sack of Magdeburg==

While Gustavus Adolphus landed his army in Mecklenburg and was in Berlin, trying to make alliances with the leaders of Northern Germany, Tilly laid siege to the city of Magdeburg on the Elbe, which promised to support Sweden.

The siege began on 20 March 1631, and Tilly put his subordinate Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim in command while he campaigned elsewhere. After two months of laying siege, and after the fall of Frankfurt an der Oder to the Swedes, Pappenheim finally convinced Tilly, who had brought reinforcements, to storm the city on 20 May with 40,000 men under the personal command of Pappenheim. The assault was successful and the walls were breached, but the commanders supposedly lost control of their soldiers. A massacre of the populace ensued in which roughly 20,000 of the 25,000 inhabitants of the city perished by sword and the fire which destroyed most of the city, then one of the largest cities in Germany and about the size of Cologne or Hamburg.

Many historians consider it unlikely that Tilly ordered the city to be torched. Magdeburg was a strategically vital city of the Elbe and was needed as a resupply center for the looming fight against the Swedes. Although extremely opposed to the Reformation movement, Tilly was an experienced commander and would have recognized the strategic importance of the city. Additionally, he sent a proposal of surrender to Magdeburg days before the final assault, after the capture of the Toll redoubt. However, the city&#x27;s mayor rejected the offer, expecting a Swedish relief force to arrive soon. When the slaughter began, and no escape was possible, the children of the city were formed in procession and marched across the marketplace singing Luther&#x27;s hymn &quot;Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort&quot; whose opening verse translates as &quot;Lord keep us steadfast in thy Word, Curb Pope and Turk who by the sword, would wrest the kingdom from thy Son, and set at naught all he hath done.&quot; The children were slain without mercy, but whether by order from Tilly or not remains debated in some quarters. Tilly afterwards reportedly wrote to the Emperor, 

==Campaign against the Swedes and death==
Following Magdeburg, Tilly engaged the army of Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Breitenfeld on 17 September 1631, near the city of Leipzig, which he had reached after laying waste to Saxony. In the battle he was outmaneuvered by King Gustavus Adolphus and suffered 27,000 casualties. The Swedes’ maneuvering and accurate, rapid artillery fire caused his troops to break and flee. He withdrew, and political rivalries prevented Wallenstein from coming to his aid, so he turned to defence. He defeated the Swedes at Bamberg on 9 March 1632. While attempting to prevent the Swedes from crossing into Bavaria over the Lech near Rain am Lech, he was wounded early in the Battle of Rain on 15 April by a 90-gram arquebus bullet (not, as erroneously reported, by a culverin cannon ball), which shattered his right thigh, and died of osteomyelitis (bone infection) fifteen days later in Ingolstadt at the age of 73 on 30 April 1632. His tomb is in Altötting, Upper Bavaria.

==Descendants==
Fraternal descendants include Antonio Octavio Tserclaes de Tilly (1646–1715) and Claude Frédéric t&#x27;Serclaes, Count of Tilly (1648-1723). Antonio was a general and nobleman in service of Spain, while his younger brother Claude fought in service of the army of the Dutch Republic. A sister or daughter, Albertina, of this Prince Antonio Octavio, would be the first root for the Spanish ducal title, Dukes of Tserclaes, bestowed in July 1856 by Queen Isabella II of Spain to members of the Pérez de Guzmán family, living in Jerez and Seville, Spain.

==Fictional appearances==
* Tilly is mentioned in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot;: in the scene in which his funeral is held, Mother Courage famously says &quot;I don&#x27;t care if this funeral is a historical event, to me the mutilation of my daughter&#x27;s face is a historical event.&quot;
* Tilly and the sack of Magdeburg are mentioned in the novel &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.
* Tilly is depicted in First Breitenfeld and in the Battle of Rain in the novel &quot;1632&quot;.

<doc id="279661" wikidata="Q3133158" url="?curid=279661" title="Henry Bunbury (caricaturist)">
<text>Henry William Bunbury (1 July 1750 – 7 May 1811) was an English caricaturist. The second son of Sir William Bunbury, 5th Baronet (see Bunbury baronets), of Mildenhall, Suffolk, he came of an old Norman family. He was educated at Westminster School and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and soon showed a talent for drawing, especially for humorous subjects. He temporarily left Cambridge to embark on a tour of Europe, during which time he may have studied in Rome; he returned to school in 1771 but is not known to have completed a degree. His European travels inspired a series of caricatures mocking foreigners, notably his &quot;La Cuisine de la Poste&quot;, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1770.

His more serious efforts were no great success, but his caricatures are as famous as those of his contemporaries Thomas Rowlandson and James Gillray, good examples being his &quot;A Long Story&quot; (1782), &quot;Country Club&quot; (1788), and &quot;Barber&#x27;s Shop&quot; (1803). Most of his caricatures are described in detail in the &quot;Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum&quot;. He was a popular character, and the friend of most of the notabilities of his day, whom he never offended by attempting political satire; his easy circumstances and social position (he was commissioned as lieutenant-colonel of the West Suffolk Militia on 26 August 1788, and was appointed equerry to the Duke of York and Albany in 1787) allowed him the leisure to practise his talents.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; describes his &quot;A Long Minuet as Danced at Bath&quot; as the most successful of his lifetime, using an &quot;innovative story-telling&quot; format that is considered a forerunner to the comic strip. His caricatures were regularly reissued, even as he turned his attention to other subjects: he finished half of a commissioned set of 48 drawings of Shakespearean works before abandoning the series in 1796, and after the death of his wife and eldest son he took up oil painting.

In August 1771 he married Catherine, eldest daughter of Kane William Horneck (an officer in the Royal Engineers) and his wife Hannah Muggles. Bunbury and Catherine&#x27;s second son Henry Bunbury succeeded to the baronetcy.

<doc id="279663" wikidata="Q1508837" url="?curid=279663" title="Digital piano">
<text>A digital piano is a type of electronic keyboard instrument designed to serve primarily as an alternative to the traditional acoustic piano, both in how it feels to play and in the sound it produces. Digital pianos use either synthesized emulation or recorded samples of an acoustic piano, which are played through one or more internal loudspeakers. They also incorporate weighted keys, which recreate the feel of an acoustic piano. Some digital pianos are designed to also look like an upright or grand piano. Others may be very simple, without a stand.

While digital pianos may sometimes fall short of acoustic ones in feel and sound, their advantages include being smaller, weighing much less, and costing less than an acoustic piano. In addition, they do not need to be tuned, and their tuning can be modified to match the tuning of another instrument (e.g. a pipe organ). Like other electronic musical instruments, they can be connected to an amplifier or a PA system to produce a sound loud enough for a large venue or, at the other extreme, may be heard through headphones only. Some digital pianos can emulate other sounds besides the piano, the most common ones being pipe organ, electric piano, Hammond organ, and harpsichord. Digital pianos are often used in music schools and music studios as a replacement for traditional instruments.

== Features ==
Similar to a traditional acoustic piano, the defining feature of a digital piano is a musical keyboard with 88 keys. The keys are weighted to simulate the action of an acoustic piano and are velocity-sensitive so that the volume and timbre of a played note depends on how hard the key is pressed.
Instruments with fewer keys, and those with keys that are unweighted (similar to electric organs and synthesizers) or not velocity-sensitive tend to be called electronic or digital keyboards rather than digital pianos.
Instruments that less accurately simulate the feel of an acoustic piano may be described as &quot;semi-weighted&quot;, while those that are more accurate may be said to possess &quot;hammer action&quot;. Some digital pianos incorporate actual hammers to better simulate a grand piano&#x27;s touch.

In a typical digital piano with hammer action, as the key (1) is depressed, a cam (4) underneath the key presses on one end of a hammer (5), lifting the hammer weight (6). A retaining hook (2) with a cushion is provided so the key does not rise above its resting position.

The shape, size, and weight of the hammer affects the touch of the key, as does the placement of the sensor(s) (7), pivots (8), and the design of the mechanical linkage between the key cam and the hammer. To make the keybed more compact, many digital keyboards use a pivot point in the rear and hammers underneath the keys, as illustrated.

Digital pianos typically use analog sensors for their keyboard action, as opposed to digital sensors of a regular electronic keyboard and synthesizer. These sensors work in a similar way to those in analog joysticks found on video game controllers, where velocity input is converted from the key movement as well, not just the initial pressure of the key sensor.

Other common features include:
* Volume control; line-out audio connections; headphone output
* Additional instrument sounds
* MIDI implementation (most provide General MIDI, which offers 128 instrument sounds and 9 drum kits)
* Features to assist in learning (such as illuminated keys) and composition (such as a built-in sequencer)
* Transposition

=== Piano emulation ===

In general, the sounds produced by a digital piano are based on sampling, by which acoustic piano sound samples are stored in ROM. The samples are usually created using high-quality pianos, professional microphones, and high-quality preamps in a professional recording studio. Usually multiple samples are available for the same keystroke, attempting to reproduce the diversity of sounds heard on an acoustic piano. However, sample-based digital pianos have limitations on the faithfulness with which they simulate acoustic pianos. Because samples are taken for only a limited number of intensity levels, digital pianos usually lack the continuous timbral changes that characterize acoustic pianos. They may also lack the harmonic tones that result when certain combinations of notes are sounded, and the natural reverberation that is heard when an acoustic piano is played percussively. They often lack the incidental acoustic noises associated with piano playing, such as the sounds of pedals being depressed and the associated machinery shifting within the piano, which some consider a benefit. These limitations apply to most acoustic instruments and their sampled counterparts, the difference often being described as &quot;visceral&quot;.

Many digital pianos, especially those that resemble acoustic pianos, have built-in pedals that function much as those on acoustic pianos. Commercially available pedal switches, commonly used for regular electronic keyboards, can also be used, especially on portable models. On an acoustic piano the sustain pedal lifts the dampers for all strings, allowing them to resonate naturally with the notes played. Only high-end professional digital pianos can reproduce this sympathetic resonance effect.

Earlier digital pianos, such as those produced in the 1990s, often had polyphony limited to 32 or 64 notes.

Some digital piano implementations, like Roland V-Piano, Yamaha MODUS, Casio Celviano Grand Hybrid, and the software-based Pianoteq, use mathematical models based on acoustic pianos to generate sound, which brings the ability to generate sounds that vary more freely depending on how the keys have been struck, in addition to allow a more realistic implementation of the distinctive resonances and acoustical noises of acoustic pianos.

=== Other instruments ===

Most digital pianos can produce a variety of different piano timbres. For example, a digital piano may have settings for a grand piano, an upright piano, a tack piano, a harpsichord and various electric piano models such as the Fender Rhodes, the Yamaha CP70, the Wurlitzer, and the Yamaha DX7. It may also emulate other keyboard instruments, including organ, harmonium, and clavichord. Some digital pianos also incorporate other basic &quot;synthesizer&quot; sounds such as guitars, string ensemble, brass instruments, woodwinds and drum kits.

Some high-end digital pianos that offer a wide range of instrument sounds similar to electronic keyboards are known as ensemble digital pianos, or just ensemble pianos.

=== MIDI features ===

Digital pianos usually offer a MIDI connection, allowing them to control or be controlled by other electronic instruments and sequencers. They may also have an external storage slot to save and load MIDI data, which the piano can play automatically, allowing it to function as a player piano. Some have a built-in sequencer to aid in composition.

Most digital pianos can be connected to a computer. With appropriate software such as scorewriters, digital audio workstations and sequencers, the computer can handle sound generation, mixing of tracks, music notation, musical instruction, and other music composition tasks.

==Form factors==

The physical form of a digital piano can vary considerably.

=== Traditional type ===
Traditional digital pianos are designed to resemble the console of an electronic organ or a spinet harpsichord but usually having a stand rather than fully enclosed lower section. Some models are based on the casework of traditional upright pianos with a fully enclosed bottom part and metallic weighted sustain and soft pedals that resemble traditional piano pedals. An opposite and 2000s-era trend is to produce an instrument which has a unique and distinctive appearance, unobtainable with a conventional wooden-cabinet instrument. These instruments have a modern appearance, with a sleek plastic cabinet that makes no attempt to emulate traditional instruments. Yamaha, Kawai and Casio make models which are designed to stand against a wall and are far shallower from keyboard to back than any possible acoustic upright design, as well as a shorter height.

Traditional digital pianos, due to their form, offer less portability than the other types, and are mainly designed for use in a single place (e.g. home, classrooms or studios), and are not intended for mobility such as on stage or for live performance.

=== Upright type ===
These are a sub-type of traditional digital pianos that offer a more classical design which closely resemble an acoustic upright piano. The most expensive models may appear similar in their outer appearance and height to a full-size upright piano. Upright digital pianos are mainly intended for home use and are usually more expensive than the other types, due to the expensive wooden case. Some models, especially the higher-end, more expensive ones, often use wooden keyboards, as opposed to regular plastic keyboards.

=== Grand type ===
An uncommon form of digital piano that resembles a grand piano, usually with a more precision keyboard action and high-quality sound system built into the unit&#x27;s cabinet in a similar manner as the strings on a grand piano. These pianos are mostly high-end novelty models offered by only small number of manufacturers, and often have higher prices than an average acoustic piano.

=== Stage piano ===
Another common form is the stage piano, designed for use with live performances, professional audio, or in a recording studio. This type of digital piano normally makes no attempt to imitate the physical appearance of an acoustic piano, rather resembling a generic synthesizer or music workstation. A distinguishing feature of most stage pianos is a lack of internal loudspeakers and amplification - it is normally assumed that a powerful keyboard amplifier or PA system will be used. However, some stage pianos are equipped with powered speakers.

=== Portable type ===

Yet another form is the portable digital piano which often combines the capabilities of stage pianos, but with additional features similar to a conventional home keyboard. These digital pianos are mostly designed for various purposes such as home, studio, classroom, stage or personal use. It is similar in form to a stage piano, but much lighter in weight, and having a more compact size. Unlike stage pianos, portable digital pianos were commonly equipped with built-in amplification and loudspeakers, usually has lower cost than other types, and its sound quality was often comparable or similar to that of a conventional keyboards due to a simpler sound synthesis system, though some models, often utilize a similar sound generation system as the more advanced model lineups of the same manufacturer. Many of them also contain a wide assortment of sounds, like one would expect from an electronic keyboard, including sound effects and drum kits. Also like conventional keyboards, these digital pianos often feature an automated &quot;rhythm section&quot; function which is controlled by playing chords with the left hand.

Most portable digital pianos could be freely fitted in a regular keyboard stand like a stage piano, while some types also come equipped with a dedicated matching stand which, when assembled, will have a slight resemblance to a console digital piano.

Portable digital pianos, for the sake of lower production cost, were often equipped with a less complex system for the weighted keys. As a result, the feel of the keys is usually much less realistic than other digital pianos. However, it still retain the emulated weight mechanism (lower keys are heavier than higher ones), though not as precise as more expensive pianos, but far more true to life than a keyboard. Furthermore, certain models include synthetic ivory-like keys as opposed to standard plastic keys.

===Hybrid type===
Hybrids are a type of high-performance digital piano that incorporate actual piano action and high-quality modeled samples of an acoustic piano. This type of digital piano was first popularized by Roland in the 1980s, with their flagship stage piano at the time, RD-1000.

=== Piano module ===
There are also digital piano modules, which are simply keyboardless sound modules chiefly containing piano samples. To use these modules, they are typically connected to a MIDI controller keyboard, and the output signal from the module is plugged into a keyboard amplifier or PA system. One early example of a digital piano module is Roland&#x27;s 1986 MKS-20 digital piano module.

&quot;Pianoteq&quot; is a software synthesizer which shares some characteristics with piano modules.
