<text>Zrenjanin (, ; ; ; ; ) is a city and the administrative center of the Central Banat District in the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. The city urban area has a population of 67,129 inhabitants, while the city administrative area has 105,722 inhabitants (2022 census data). The old name for Zrenjanin is Veliki Bečkerek or &quot;Nagybecskerek&quot; as it was known under Austria-Hungary up until 1918. After World War I and the liberation of Veliki Bečkerek the new name of the city was Petrovgrad, in honor of His Majesty King Peter I the Great Liberator, the King of Serbia and the King of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

Zrenjanin is the 2nd largest city in the Serbian part of the Banat geographical region, and the 4th largest city in Vojvodina (after Novi Sad, Subotica and Pancevo). The city was designated European City of Sport 2021.

==Name==
The city was named after Žarko Zrenjanin (1902–1942) in 1946 in honour and remembrance of his name. The former Serbian name of the city was &quot;Bečkerek&quot; (Бечкерек) or &quot;Veliki Bečkerek&quot; (Велики Бечкерек). In 1935 the city was renamed to &quot;Petrovgrad&quot; (Петровград) in honor of king Peter I of Serbia. It was called &quot;Petrovgrad&quot; from 1935–46. In Hungarian, the city is known as &quot;Nagybecskerek&quot;, in German as &quot;Großbetschkerek&quot; or &quot;Betschkerek&quot;, in Romanian as &quot;Becicherecul Mare&quot; or &quot;Zrenianin&quot;, in Slovak as &quot;Zreňanin&quot;, in Rusin as &quot;Зрењанин&quot;, in Croatian as &quot;Zrenjanin&quot;, and in Turkish as &quot;Beşkelek&quot; (meaning &quot;five melons&quot;) or &quot;Beçkerek&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory===

Prehistory can be divided into the PalaeolithicOld Stone Age and the NeolithicNew Stone Age. In Zrenjanin&#x27;s regions no archaeological sites of the Palaeolithic have been found. The only exception makes the discovery of mammoth’s head and other bones found on the banks of Tisa River near Novi Bečej in the year 1952. The discovered archaeological sites, however, indicate that these regions had already been inhabited in the early Neolithic period about 5000 years BC. The most important archaeological site from this period is so-called Krstić tumulus, near Mužlja, about away from Zrenjanin. Here were found the ceramics, with interesting ornaments. Beside the brewery ground have been found rough, with coloured fine ceramics, ornaments (Starčevo culture). The middle Neolithic appeared in our area as Vinča and Potisje culture, in the down course of the Tisa River. What makes this area important is the fact that the influence of two parallel cultures flew through it at the same time. The Iron Age has not been enough explored yet. A few regions with some archaeological materials from the Iron Age have been found: in the residential area Šumica a tip of a spear was found and near the oil factory, pieces of ceramics from the Bronze Age were discovered.
At the beginning of the common era, this area was settled by many native tribes, but also by many newcomer tribes: the Illyrians, the Celts, the Goths, the Geths, the Sarmatian and Jazghs. In the end of the third century and in the middle of the fourth century, in the area of Zrenjanin and its surroundings, the Sarmatian tribe Roxolani appeared. From this period a Sarmatian’s graveyard has been found in a city residential district, near the railroad bridge. Finally in the necropolis, not far from Aradac, “Mečka”, more than 120 graves, which date from the end of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh century, have been excavated in 1952.
===Middle Ages===

The first historical records mentioning Zrenjanin (Bečkerek) date from the 14th century, the time when Charles I, King of Hungary and Croatia (1301–1342), used to visit Banat and spend time in his capital Timișoara. (Near today&#x27;s Zrenjanin a coin was found with the inscription &quot;Charles I&quot;.) Many noblemen came with the King, including the powerful Imre Becsei. The areas where Becsei settled down were named for him, “Bechereki” and “Beche” (Novi Bečej). The oldest written records of Bečkerek date from Budim Capitulum&#x27;s document of collecting the Pope&#x27;s tens taxes in 1326, 1331 and 1332. Judging by the size of the taxes, Bečkerek of 1330s was an average village. The first settlers were the landless Hungarian peasants. There were the Serbs in Banat, too. During the reign of Louis I of Hungary (1343–1382), more Serbs migrated to the area from the south, and with them many Orthodox priests.
After the Turkish victory at the battle of Nicopolis (1396) the Hungarian King Sigismund (1387–1437) was considering defending the territory settled by the Serbs, and he is known to have visited Bečkerek on September 30, 1398. The town was granted to Stefan Lazarević at the end of the 1403. The despot became the vassal of the Hungarian King; but he got Bečkerek and the title of the Great Head of the Torontál County.

===Ottoman period===

The Hungarian King Ferdinand appointed friar Djordje Martinović, a commander of his forces, to defend the town from the Ottomans. Hungary was attacked by 80,000 Ottoman soldiers under the command of Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. On 15 September 1551, the siege of the town Bečej was raised and the town was taken after four days. On 24 September, the Bečkerek fortress was besieged. Many people left town earlier and with few defenders the town couldn&#x27;t be defended and those eighty, who left surrendered the next day. Malković was appointed the lord of Bečkerek. After the Ottomans had taken Timișoara in 1552, Banat became a special province, the Temeşvar Eyalet, which was made up of several sanjaks, including the Sanjak of Beçkerek.
During Ottoman occupation, the sanjak had a military administration. Due to good behaviour of the rayah, the inhabitants were exempt from war taxes. During the 165 years of Ottoman rule, Bečkerek consisted of two separate settlements: the settlement of Bečkerek and the village of Gradnulica. The town was divided into two parts, a Turkish and a Serbian. The Turkish part was fenced and closed, while the Serbian one was open. On the main square there was a large mosque built and inside the fortress there was a little one. There was a Turkish bath, and around it there were about twenty stores. Gradnulica was a disorderly village, whose centre was approximately on the crossroad of the present streets Sindjelićeva and Djurdjevska. Prior to Ottoman occupation, the citizens were Serbs and Hungarians. At the end of the 18th century, there were about fifty Turkish families. According to the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), the Temeşvar Eyalet, including Bečkerek, stayed under Ottoman rule, while bordering territories once again came under the Military Frontier. After the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18 Bečkerek went under Habsburg rule.

===Habsburg and Austrian period (1718–1914)===

As a crown province, Banat belonged directly to the Vienna court. The first governor, appointed by the Emperor, was Count Claudius Mercy. By the imperial edict on 12 September 1718, Banat was divided into 13 districts, with the main administration in Timișoara at its head. The District of Banat included a few settlements: Idjoš, Arač, Bečej, Itebej, Elemir, Ečka and Aradac. The first chief of this district was Titus Vespanius Slucki. After the Turkish forces and Turks families had withdrawn, the land was left devastated without labour, which could till the soil and paid taxes. That&#x27;s why the Austrian court tried to settle Banat as soon as possible. 
The colonization lasted from 1718–24, when the town was settled mostly by Germans, but the Serbs never stopped arriving. The military frontier in Potisje was displaced. In the following years Italians, Frenchmen, Romanians arrived and then the Catalans from Barcelona, who escaped the repression after the War of the Spanish Succession and settled in a place which is now the suburb of Dolja within Zrenjanin. The town was called New Barcelona. But the life was difficult in this marsh area with many contagious diseases, so many died and others left. 
In the summer of 1738 there was the great plague. The Count Mersy wanted to turn marshes into fertile soil and he began to regulate the Begej River. In the middle and down course of the river a long canal was built, to make the river traffic possible between Bečkerek and Timișoara. On the first of November 1745 Sebastian Krazeisen began to make beer in the first brewery and that meant the first start of the industrialization. In the same year the first Serb&#x27;s school was mentioned. 
On 6 June 1769, Maria Theresa granted the Community of Great Bečkerek, the privilege of becoming the trading centre. By this privilege the whole social-economic life of the former Bečkerek was regulated and it got the status of the town. In 1769 the first hospital was built. In 1779, by the new organization of Torontál County, Bečkerek became its centre. The city was briefly restored to Ottoman administration from 1787 to 1788 during Austro-Turkish War (1787–91).
During the 18th century it developed into thriving economic and cultural centre, but the great fire destroyed a large portion of the town in 1807. The town was soon rebuilt. The fire came from the brewery, on 30 August 1807. After the fire a new regulation of streets had been done, houses had been built from stronger materials, roads had been rebuilt. The river traffic was especially intensive. The theatre building with an attractively decorated hall was built in 1839. In 1846 the Grammar School was opened and in 1847 the first printing shop.

The 1848–49 Revolutions impacted Bečkerek. The Serbs revolted, aiming for autonomy within the Austrian Empire. At the May Assembly (13–15 May 1848), the Serbian Vojvodina was proclaimed, including most of what is today Vojvodina. Serbs from Bečkerek participated in the uprising against Hungarian authority (which refused Serb rights) and from 26 January to 29 April 1849 the town was under Serb rebel control. In 1849, the town became part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar until 1860.
Although that time was known in history as a period of Bach&#x27;s absolutism, the second part of the 19th century brought the town new developing benefits. New industrial facilities and handicraft stores were opened in every part of the town. Late 19th and early 20th century was progressive period for Veliki Bečkerek. Railway arrived in 1883, while post office was opened back in 1737.

===World War I and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia===

After the Sarajevo assassination, more than 30 citizens of Bečkerek were accused by the Austria-Hungary’s authorities of high treason. Among them was Dr Emil Gavrila, who together with Svetozar Miletić and Jaša Tomić, worked very hard on the cultural and social strengthening of Serbs. Those Serbs recruited in the Austria-Hungary&#x27;s army began to desert to avoid having to fight their own people. 7,000 of them formed volunteer detachments (people were from Banat and Srem) at the Eastern front and fought at Dobruja, but 79 fought on the Salonice front. After years, the Serbs forces made a breakthrough of the Salonice front in 1918 and began to liberate their own country. The First Army in command of Vojvoda Petar Bojović freed Belgrade on 1 November 1918 and began to occupy Vojvodina.

On 17 November, Serbian army arrived at Veliki Bečkerek. On 31 October 1918, the Serb Chamber of People of the town founded in the war conditions, as a temporary authority with Dr Slavko Župunski at its head. Serb army, the infantry iron regiment “Prince Mihajlo” and the infantry brigade with Colonel Dragutin Ristić in command came into the town on 17 November 1918. A few days after Vojvodina had been occupied, its provinces were attached to the Kingdom of Serbs and on December 1, 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was founded, as the first South Slavic state. The town of Veliki Bečkerek became the administrative centre of Torontal-Tamiš County, and after its repealing, the town became the headquarters of District Office. In 1929 the town became part of the Danube Banovina. By the Town Council decision made on 29 September 1934, and confirmed by the Town Authority on 18 February 1935, the town was renamed Petrovgrad, after the king Peter I.

===Second World War and SFR Yugoslavia===
After the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had capitulated on 18 April 1941, and Nazi Germany occupied the country, the German Forces came into Petrovgrad. The authority in Banat had domestic GermansVolksdeutsche, who immediately started to confiscate Jews&#x27; property and arrested patriots. The town was renamed Great Bečkerek and it was the headquarters of the occupation authority for Banat (1941–44), headed by Juraj Špiler, and a concentration camp in Cara Dušana Street. The Petrovgrad Synagogue was razed brick by brick by order of Jurgen Wagner.

The camp existed for almost two years and thousands of people passed through it. In town there were many underground groups supported by the Communist Party, which fought the German occupiers and the Germans made reprisals. On 2 October 1944, the Red Army Forces came into town, and, after a short fight, took command of most vital public buildings. The following day the first meeting on National Liberation Committee for the town Petrovgrad was held. Eight members of the national liberation resistance, from the town and its surroundings were announced National Heroes: Žarko Zrenjanin, Svetozar Marković Toza, Pap Pavle, Stevica Jovanović, Servo Mihalj, Nedeljko Barnić Žarki, Boško Vrebalov, and Bora Mikin Marko.

During World War II, the town infrastructure was kept almost saved. Except in the final fights for the town, there were no war actions on the territory of the town. The Germans tried to damage and destroy some industrial buildings, but it was prevented. Only Anau-Winkler&#x27;s mill and the monumental Jewish synagogue in the centre of the town were destroyed. After World War II important social-political changes were made in the country, which, of course, had their influence on the development of Zrenjanin, newly named in 1946. In August 1945 the Agriculture Reform Act came into force, in June 1950 the Worker Self-Management Act, in 1959 the first direct urban plan of the town development, which indicated the urbanism-economic development of the town, was passed.

The development, in the first after war decade, was directed by the directive plans, which were based on the principles of socialist economy in which the most important industrial branches were industry and agriculture. By the 1980s many people left their villages and moved into towns which brought many changes in the social, educational and ethnic structure of the town. There was permanently shortage of housing. That is why many new parts of the town and many new apartment buildings were built. Zrenjanin became an important agricultural, industrial, cultural and sport centre, at the time Zrenjanin was one of the most powerful industrial centers of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia led by Tito.

===After 1991===
The town&#x27;s development has always been strongly affected by the social-economic circumstances reflecting the State surroundings that Zrenjanin found in. At the beginning of 1990s, when the war broke out on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and the country was falling apart, it led to rather hard social and economic crisis in this area, all that caused an economic stagnation, unemployment, large migrations of refugees from the former Yugoslav Republics: Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The town experienced the first political changes by the introducing of multiparty system at the end of 1996 when the local government was ruled by the coalition Zajedno (Together) and in 2000 by the coalition Democratic opposition of Serbia. On 24 March 1999, the NATO bombing of Serbia began but the town was not targeted. Life in the town was quite normal, in spite of the dangerous situation elsewhere in the country. 
In the first years after the end of war activities the Town and its citizens have been adjusting to new economic and social-economic conditions, known as transition. Instead of previous large economic combines and companies plenty of new flexible private enterprises are established and foreign capital is starting to flow in Zrenjanin. New industrial and work and residential zones are formed and the Town&#x27;s General Plan 2006-2026 and Sustainable Development Strategy 2006-2013 are made and approved. At the end of 2007, introducing a new national territorial organisation followed by necessary legislation, the Municipality of Zrenjanin has been upgraded to an administrative and territorial status of a city.

In 2004, the town&#x27;s tap water was deemed unsafe for consumption due to high levels of arsenic. As of 2022, the ban remains in place.

<text>The Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), also known as the common coot, or Australian coot, is a member of the rail and crake bird family, the Rallidae. It is found in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and parts of North Africa. It has a slaty-black body, a glossy black head and a white bill with a white frontal shield. The sexes are similar. Similar looking coot species are found throughout the world, with the largest variety of coot species living in South America.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian coot was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Fulica atra&quot;. Linnaeus specified the locality as Europe but this is now restricted to Sweden. The binomial name is from Latin: &quot;Fulica&quot; means &#x27;coot&#x27;, and &quot;atra&quot; means &#x27;black&#x27;.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;F. a. atra&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – Europe and north Africa to Japan, India, southeast Asia, Philippines and Borneo
* &quot;F. a. lugubris&quot; Müller, S, 1847 – Java, Bali, northwest New Guinea
* &quot;F. a. novaeguineae&quot; Rand, 1940 – central New Guinea
* &quot;F. a. australis&quot; Gould, 1845 – Australia and New Zealand

An extinct subspecies &quot;F. atra pontica&quot; has been described from the Chalcolithic (around 4800–4400 BP) from the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.

==Description==
The Eurasian coot is in length with a wing-span of ; males weigh around and females . It is largely black except for the white bill and frontal shield (which gives rise to the phrase &quot;as bald as a coot&quot;, in use as early as 1430). As a swimming species, the coot has partial webbing on its long strong toes. The sexes are similar in appearance.

The juvenile is paler than the adult, has a whitish breast, and lacks the facial shield; the adult black plumage develops when about 3–4 months old, but the white shield is only fully developed at about one year old.

The Eurasian coot is a noisy bird with a wide repertoire of crackling, explosive, or trumpeting calls, often given at night.

==Distribution and habitat==

The coot breeds across much of the Old World on freshwater lakes and ponds, and like its relative the common moorhen, has adapted well to living in urban environments, often being found in parks and gardens with access to water. It occurs and breeds in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa. The species has recently expanded its range into New Zealand. It is resident in the milder parts of its range, but migrates further south and west from much of Asia in winter as the waters freeze. It is known to occur as a vagrant in North America.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The Eurasian coot is much less secretive than most of the rail family, and can be seen swimming on open water or walking across waterside grasslands. It is an aggressive species, and strongly territorial during the breeding season, and both parents are involved in territorial defence. During the non-breeding season they may form large flocks, possibly related to predator avoidance.

It is reluctant to fly and when taking off runs across the water surface with much splashing. It does the same, but without actually flying, when travelling a short distance at speed in territorial disputes or on land to escape from intruders. As with many rails, its weak flight does not inspire confidence, but on migration, usually at night, it can cover surprisingly large distances. It bobs its head as it swims, and makes short dives from a little jump.

When fighting other waterbirds (especially other coots), the coot attacks by charging its opponent and striking them with its long legs.

===Breeding===

The nest is a bulky structure that either floats on the water or is built in shallow water on a low or barely submerged stump or log, making a neat, large bowl. It is constructed of plant stems and leaves with a lining of finer material. Normally concealed in vegetation the nest can sometimes be placed in the open. It is built by both sexes with the male collecting most of the material which is incorporated by the female. The eggs are laid at daily intervals. The clutch usually contains between six and ten smooth and slightly glossy buff coloured eggs that are covered with black or dark brown speckles. On average they are and weigh . The eggs are incubated by both sexes beginning after the second egg is laid and hatch asynchronously after 21 to 24 days. The chicks are precocial and nidifugous. The chicks are covered with a black down. On the body the down has yellow hair-like tips. On the sides of the head, nape and throat the hair-like tips are longer and orange-red. Between the eyes and on the lores, the tips are red. The shield is bright red and the bill is red with a white tip. The young are brooded by the female for the first three to four days during which time food is brought by the male. The male also builds one or more platforms that is used for roosting and brooding the chicks. On leaving the nest, the brood is sometimes split up with each parent taking care of a separate group. The young can feed themselves when they are around 30 days and fledge at 55 to 60 days. Eurasian coots normally only have a single brood each year but in some areas such as Britain they will sometimes attempt a second brood. They first breed when they are one to two years old.

Chick mortality occurs mainly due to starvation rather than predation. Most chicks died in the first 10 days after hatching, when they are most dependent on adults for food. Coots can be very brutal to their own young under pressure such as the lack of food. They will bite young that are begging for food and repeatedly do this until it stops begging. If the begging continues, they may bite so hard that the chick is killed. Coots will also lay their eggs in the nests of other coots when their environment or physical condition limits their ability to breed, or to lengthen their reproductive life.

===Feeding===

The coot is an omnivore, and will take a variety of small live prey including the eggs of other water birds, as well as algae, vegetation, seeds and fruit. It shows considerable variation in its feeding techniques, grazing on land or in the water. In the water it may upend in the fashion of a mallard or dive in search of food.

==Status==
The Eurasian coot is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Coots are medium-sized water birds that are members of the rail family, Rallidae. They constitute the genus Fulica, the name being the Latin term for &quot;coot&quot;. Coots have predominantly black plumage, and—unlike many rails—they are usually easy to see, often swimming in open water.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Fulica&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is the Latin word for a Eurasian coot. The name was used by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1555. The type species is the Eurasian coot.

A group of coots is referred to as a &quot;covert&quot; or &quot;cover&quot;.

===Species===
The genus contains 10 extant species and one which is now extinct.
===Extinct species===

==== Recently extinct species ====
* &quot;Fulica newtonii&quot; – Mascarene coot (extinct, c. 1700)

==== Late Quaternary species ====

* &quot;Fulica chathamensis&quot; – Chatham Island coot (early Holocene of the Chatham Islands)
* &quot;Fulica montanei&quot; (late Pleistocene to early Holocene of Chile)
* &quot;Fulica prisca&quot; – New Zealand coot (early Holocene of New Zealand) 
*&quot;Fulica shufeldti&quot; – (late Pleistocene of Florida) possibly a paleosubspecies of &quot;Fulica americana&quot;; formerly &quot;F. minor&quot;

==== Fossil species ====

* &quot;Fulica infelix&quot; – (early Pliocene of Juntura, Malheur County, Oregon, USA)

==Description==
Coots have prominent frontal shields or other decoration on the forehead, with red to dark red eyes and coloured bills. Many have white on the under tail. The featherless shield gave rise to the expression &quot;as bald as a coot&quot;, which the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites in use as early as 1430. Like other rails, they have long, lobed toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. Coots have strong legs and can walk and run vigorously. They tend to have short, rounded wings and are weak fliers, though northern species nevertheless can cover long distances. They typically congregate in large rafts in open water. They are socially gregarious and messy aquatic feeders. 

==Distribution and habitat==
The greatest species variety occurs in South America, and the genus likely originated there. They are common in Europe and North America. Coot species that migrate do so at night. The American coot has been observed rarely in Britain and Ireland, while the Eurasian coot is found across Asia, Australia and parts of Africa. In southern Louisiana, the coot is referred to by the French name &quot;poule d&#x27;eau&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;water hen&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Coots are omnivorous, eating mainly plant material, but also small animals, fish and eggs. They are aggressively territorial during the breeding season, but are otherwise often found in sizeable flocks on the shallow vegetated lakes they prefer.

Chick mortality occurs mainly due to starvation rather than predation as coots have difficulty feeding a large family of hatchlings on the tiny shrimp and insects that they collect. Many chicks die in the first 10 days after hatching, when they are most dependent on adults for food. Coots can be very brutal to their own young under pressure such as the lack of food, and after about three days they start attacking their own chicks when they beg for food. After a short while, these attacks concentrate on the weaker chicks, who eventually give up begging and die. The coot may eventually raise only two or three out of nine hatchlings. In this attacking behaviour, the parents are said to &quot;tousle&quot; their young. This can result in the death of the chick.

<text>Mar del Plata is a city on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It is the seat of General Pueyrredón district. Mar del Plata is the second largest city in Buenos Aires Province. The name &quot;Mar del Plata&quot; is short for &quot;Mar del Río de la Plata,&quot; and means &quot;sea of the Río de la Plata basin&quot; or &quot;adjoining sea to the (River) Plate region.&quot; Mar del Plata is one of the major fishing ports and the biggest seaside beach resort in Argentina.
With a population of 682,605 as per the , it is the 5th largest city in Argentina.

== History ==


Pre-Spanish era: The region was inhabited by &quot;Günuna Kena&quot; nomads (also known as northern Tehuelches). They were later (after the 11th century) strongly influenced by the Mapuche culture.

1577–1857: First European explorers. Sir Francis Drake made a reconnaissance of the coast and its sea lion colonies; Don Juan de Garay explored the area by land a few years later, in 1581. In 1742, during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, eight survivors of , part of Admiral Anson expedition and led by midshipman Isaac Morris, lived through a ten-month ordeal before being decimated and captured by the Tehuelches, who eventually handed them to the Spaniards. After holding the Englishmen as prisoners, they returned Morris and his surviving companions to London in 1746. First colonization attempt by Jesuit Order near Laguna de los Padres ended in disaster (1751).

1857–1874: The Portuguese entrepreneur José Coelho de Meirelles, taking advantage of the country&#x27;s abundance of wild cattle, built a pier and a factory for salted meat near Cabo Corrientes, but the business only lasted a few years.

1874–1886: Patricio Peralta Ramos acquired the now abandoned factory along with the surrounding terrain, and founded the town on February 10, 1874. Basque rancher Pedro Luro bought a part of Peralta Ramos land for agricultural production. First docks also erected around this time.

1886–1911: The railway line from Buenos Aires, built by the Buenos Aires Great Southern reached Mar del Plata in 1886; the first hotels started their activity. The upper-class people from Buenos Aires became the first tourists of the new born village. They also established a local government that reflected their conservative ideals. Build-up of a French style resort. On 19 July 1907, the provincial legislature approved a bill that declared Mar del Plata as a city.

1911–1930: The residents, mostly newly arrived emigrants from Europe, demanded and obtained the control of the Municipality administration. The socialists were the mainstream political force in this period, carrying out social reforms and public investment. The main port was also built and inaugurated in 1916.

1930–1946: A military coup reinstated the Conservative hegemony in politics through electoral fraud and corruption, but at local levels they were quite progressive, their policies viewed in some way as a continuity of the socialist trend. In 1932, the construction of National Route 2 was completed, which connected Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires. Before this, a dirt road connected Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires using a different route, required almost two days to travel by car. The seaside &quot;Casino&quot; complex opened in 1939, was designed by architect Alejandro Bustillo, dates from this period.

1946–1955: Birth of the Peronist movement. A coalition between socialists and radicals defeated this new party by a narrow margin in Mar del Plata, but by 1948 Peronism came to dominate the local administration. The massive tourism, triggered by the welfare politics of Perón and the surge of the middle class marked a huge growth in the city&#x27;s economy.

1955–1970: After the fall of Perón, the socialists regained the upper hand in local politics; the city reached the peak in activities like construction business and building industry. There was massive emigration from other regions of Argentina.

1970–1989: Slight decline of tourism demand, counterbalanced by the increase of other industries such as fishing and machinery. General infrastructure renewal under the military rule. The centrist Radical Civic Union becomes the main political force after the return of Democracy in 1983.

1989–2010: Though Peronism replaced the radicals in central government amid a national financial crisis, the latter party continued to rule in Mar del Plata. Some resurgence of mass tourism in the early &#x27;90s was followed by a deep social crisis in town, with an increase of poverty, jobless rates and emigration. By contrast, the first decade of the 21st century shows an amazingly quick recovery in all sectors of the ailing economy.

In November 2005 the city hosted the 4th Summit of the Americas.

== Economy ==
As part of the Argentine recreational coast, tourism is Mar del Plata&#x27;s main economic activity, with over eight million tourists visiting the city in annually. Mar del Plata has a sophisticated tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, casinos, theatres and other tourist attractions. Mar del Plata is also an important sports centre with a multi-purpose Olympic style stadium (first used for the 1978 World Cup and later upgraded for the 1995 Pan American Games), five golf courses and many other facilities.

As an important fishing port, industry concentrates on fish processing and at least two large shipyards.

The area is also host to other light industry, such as textile, food manufacturing and polymers.
There is a well-developed packaging machines industry, its quality being recognized in international markets. One of these companies was one of the pioneers in the automatic packaging of tea bags, exporting its original machine-designs abroad. Another company also exports its products and has sold royalties to other countries.

During the mid-1980s, Mar del Plata saw the birth of electronics factories, focused mostly on the telecommunications field, with two of them, Nexuscom and DelSat, succeeding in the international market. By the 2010s, a local technology company, PCBOX, was manufacturing and developing personal computers, tablet computers, smartphones and action-cams.

Also during the decade of 2010, the development of the software industry resulted in the formation of 92 companies and 440 microbusiness. One of these companies, Making Sense, opened offices at San Antonio, Austin and Boston, in the United States. Along with the American COPsync, Inc, the company developed in 2013 the software for VidTac, an in-car video system for law enforcement, and the internet landing page application Lander, bought by the Silicon Valley company QuestionPro in 2016.

Since the 2000s, a local company builds and develops oil industry equipment, with customers in the United States, Russia, Oman and Egypt.

Located southwest of the city there are quartzite quarries. The stone is traditionally used in construction. There is a huge area of farms in the rural areas surrounding the city, specialized mostly in the cultivation of vegetables. In 2012, Mar del Plata became a wine-producing area, when a wine company from Mendoza province produced 20,000 lt from a vineyard at Chapadmalal beach from grape varieties such as Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Riesling and Gewürztraminer. Since then, the local winery turned into a tourist attraction. Microbeweries flourished during the 2010s, amounting by 2016 to one third of the national production.

Although the area had suffered from a high rate of unemployment from 1995 to 2003, Mar del Plata has seen 46,000 new jobs created from the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 22%.

The 2008 Davis Cup Final was held in Mar del Plata. After being shut for a decade, the Gran Hotel Provincial (one of the largest hotels in Argentina) was reopened by the Madrid-based NH Hotels, in 2009.

Mar del Plata continues to lead Argentina&#x27;s room availability: of 440,000 registered hotel rooms nationwide in early 2009, the city was home to nearly 56,000 (5,000 more than Buenos Aires).

== Architecture ==


The development of the city as a seasonal summer resort in the early 20th century led upper class tourists from Buenos Aires to build a European-inspired architecture, based mainly on the picturesque and later on the art deco styles. This gave Mar del Plata the nickname of the &quot;Argentine Biarritz&quot;. The building industry became the main non-seasonal activity of the town by 1920.

During the 1930s, 1940s, and beyond, local architects and builders, like Auro Tiribelli, Arturo Lemmi, Alberto Córsico-Picollini and Raúl Camusso recreated and transformed the picturesque values into a middle-class scale, marking the beginning of a vernacular architecture, called Mar del Plata Style, consisting in small samples of the luxury-laden summer residences of high society, built for the summer visitor as well as for the local resident.

These chalets were built with stone &quot;façades&quot;, gable roofs covered with Spanish or French tiles, prominent eaves and front porches. This gives the town some distinctive urban character compared with other Argentine cities, despite the fact that the growing mass of tourists in the &#x27;60s imposed the construction of large apartment buildings and skyscrapers as the predominant architectural style downtown.

== Climate ==
Mar del Plata has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with humid and moderate summers and relatively cool winters, although polar air masses from Antarctica are frequent. The average daily mean temperature in January is . It is in July. The West-Southwest winds can take the temperature below between mid May and early October, while the Southeast ones (the so-called &quot;Sudestada&quot;) are stronger, producing coastal showers and rough seas, as well as strong squalls, but the cold is much less intense. There is fog in the last days of fall, and springtime is often marred by sea winds and sudden temperature changes. 
The city&#x27;s summer maximum temperatures fluctuate broadly around the average of : while there are many days between and (although less than in other areas of the Pampas region), strong on-shore or southerly winds can also keep temperatures closer to , and nights can sometimes be very cool even in midsummer (falling below sometimes). However, the summer nights are usually cool to pleasant, with values between to .
Traditionally, Easter is seen as the &quot;last&quot; weekend to go to the beach on the Argentine Atlantic Coast, and average maximum temperatures are around at that time. While some years can have the last few days of about around that time, it is also possible to experience daily highs of .
Winter temperatures average during the day and at night; they sometimes climb to especially in August, but there are also days where highs stay below and temperatures fall some degrees below at night.

Spring brings the most variable weather, with heat waves bringing highs of more than followed by highs of to and perhaps a late-season frosty night all perfectly possible in October and November.

There are about six days of frost each year in the city center, and almost 27 recorded at the airport. The average dates for the first and last frost are May 23 and October 4 respectively. Snowfall is not uncommon, but snow accumulation on the ground is rare, a phenomenon that takes place every six years or so, according to the 1960-2004 data. Among the best known such occurrences in the last decades were the 1975 and 1991 snowstorms, but there were also snow accumulations in 1994 and 1997 in the highest hills area of Sierra de los Padres, in 1995 along the southern coast; the other two during the first hours of July 10, 2004 and July 15, 2010, and again in Sierra de los Padres and the southern coast on September 11, 2015. There were flurries in September 1986, June 2007, July 2011 and August 2013.

The record high is on January 14, 2022 while the record low is on July 6, 1988. The wet season occurs between October and April, especially in summer (December to March), with values over in each of those months. The average annual rainfall is .

== Government ==
Mar del Plata is the head of the department of General Pueyrredón. The current mayor of the city and department is Guillermo Montenegro, of the &quot;Juntos por el Cambio&quot; party.

The town council has some legislative powers. The term of office for both the mayor and council members is four years.

In 1919, Mar del Plata became the first town in South America to have a Socialist Mayor, a son of Italian Immigrants, Teodoro Bronzini. The Socialist Party would dominate the city political landscape for most of the 20th century.

Mar del Plata has had 109 Mayors and Commissioners from 1881 to the present.

There is a work by the American political scientist Susan Stokes about the democratic process in Mar del Plata since 1983 in comparison to other regions of Argentina. One of the main theses of her articles is that the social and economic development of Mar del Plata was quite atypical, with a strong prevalence of middle-class values that discouraged the policy of clientelism that is the common background in other urban environments of Argentina.

==Education==
The area has many schools and universities, both private and public. It once had a German school, Johann-Gutenberg-Schule.
There is a wide variety of art schools:
*Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata (UNMdP): public university with various majors.
* Escuela de Artes Visuales Martín A Malharro: A higher education school based on modern visual arts with graduate departments of graphic design, photography, illustration, teacher education, scenography and film.
* Polivalente de Arte (Escuela de Educación Secundaria Especializada en Arte Nº 1): school of secondary education that also works as a vocational school in the fields of Art, Music or Dance.

Also, there are two conservatories (classical and popular music), a vocational school of art, and a municipal school of classical and modern dance.

Mar del Plata hosted the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship, where the city&#x27;s basketball fans supported Argentina&#x27;s national basketball team to win the gold medal. All games were played in the 8,000 seat Polideportivo Islas Malvinas.

For many years, the city hosted a strong international chess tournament.

Mar del Plata hosted six matches in the 1978 FIFA World Cup at the Estadio José María Minella, which was built for the sporting event. It also hosted 6 games in the 2002 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Championship at the Polideportivo Islas Malvinas.

The city is home to Argentine Bandy Union.

In 2003 Mar del Plata hosted the 2nd Parapan American Games that featured 1,500 athletes from 28 countries competed in nine sporting events. This was the last Parapan American Games that was not tied to the Pan American Games.

The 20th World Transplant Games were held in the city from 23 to 30 August 2015.

<text>Canoeing is an activity which involves paddling a canoe with a single-bladed paddle. In some parts of Europe, canoeing refers to both canoeing and kayaking, with a canoe being called an &#x27;open canoe&#x27; or Canadian.

A few of the recreational forms of canoeing are canoe camping and canoe racing. Other forms include a wide range of canoeing on lakes, rivers, oceans, ponds and streams.

== History of organized recreational canoeing ==

Canoeing is an ancient mode of transportation. Modern recreational canoeing was established in the late 19th century. Among early promoters of canoeing as a sport was Carl Smith, who introduced canoeing to Sweden in the 1880s. In 1924, canoeing associations from Austria, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden founded the &quot;Internationalen Representation for Kanusport&quot;, the forerunner of the International Canoe Federation (ICF).

Canoeing became part of the Olympic Games in the 1936 Summer Olympics. which featured canoe sprint using a sprint canoe. Others competitive disciplines include canoe polo, whitewater canoeing, canoe marathon, ICF canoe marathon, and playboating.

More than 170 national canoe associations and federations are members of the ICF, including the American, Canadian, British, Scottish, and Welsh.

==Recreational canoeing==
Most present-day canoeing is done as or as a part of a sport or recreational activity. In some parts of Europe, canoeing refers to both canoeing and kayaking, with a canoe being called an open canoe or Canadian. 

Recreational forms of canoeing include canoe camping. Other forms include a wide range of canoeing on lakes, rivers, oceans, ponds, and streams.

== Competition ==
Competitive forms of canoeing include canoe racing such as canoe sprint and canoe marathons. The summer Olympics include canoeing competitions. Canoe slalom (previously known as whitewater slalom) is a competitive sport with the aim to navigate a decked canoe or kayak through a course of hanging downstream or upstream gates on the river rapids in the fastest time possible. It is one of the two kayak and canoeing disciplines at the Summer Olympics and is referred to by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as canoe slalom or canoe/kayak slalom. The other Olympic canoeing discipline is the canoe sprint.

In his lifetime, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, Verlen Kruger paddled the most miles (over 100,000 miles) of anyone in the sport.

<doc id="283993" wikidata="Q1577126" url="?curid=283993" title="Tren Urbano">
<text>The Tren Urbano (English: Urban Train) is a automated rapid transit system serving the main metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, specifically the capital municipality of San Juan, and the adjacent municipalities of Guaynabo and Bayamón in northeast of the main island. The Tren Urbano consists of 16 stations operating on of track along a single line. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

The Tren Urbano complements other forms of public transportation services in the San Juan metropolitan area such as the Metropolitan Bus Authority, the Cataño Ferry, taxis, and shuttles. The entire mass transportation system is operated by the Integrated Transit Authority (&quot;ATI&quot;), The Tren Urbano system is operated by Alternate Concepts, Inc. (ACI). Tren Urbano is also the Caribbean&#x27;s first rapid transit system.

== History ==
In the late 19th century, while the island was under Spanish rule, regional rail systems were begun in Puerto Rico. The railroad continued to be in use under American rule for most of the first half of the 20th century and played a key role in the transportation of people and goods throughout the island. The railroad systems of the period also played a vital role in the sugarcane industry.

From 1901 to 1946 San Juan had a street tramway network, known as the “Trolley” de San Juan, and was operated by the Porto Rico Railway, Light and Power Company with more than of tracks and ran between San Juan and Santurce. During its heyday, it was the most modern electric streetcar system in Puerto Rico, rivaled New York and Toronto, and transported nearly 10 million passengers a year.

During the 1950s, an industrial boom, partly from development programs such as Operation Bootstrap, led to the downfall of agriculture as the principal industry on the island. Automobiles became more widely available, and more efficient roads and highways and the closure of sugarcane mills displaced the need for rail transportation. Soon, it was realized that an alternative means of mass transportation was needed to complement the public bus system to alleviate the severe traffic situation that was being created, especially in the San Juan metropolitan area.

== Return of rail transit ==
===Proposals===
In 1967, proposals were made for the construction of a rapid rail transit system to serve San Juan. In 1971, the major T.U.S.C.A. study, funded jointly by the Puerto Rico Planning Board and the US federal government, recommended an islandwide elevated transit system and new community development program. That proposal would have served the San Juan metropolitan area and connected it with the rest of the island without the necessity of highway construction. However, it was not until 1989 that the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works (&quot;Departamento de Transportación y Obras Públicas&quot;, or &quot;DTOP&quot; in Spanish) officially adopted a proposal to begin design and construction of a rail system for the San Juan metropolitan area. By 1992, various alignments of the proposed system were considered, but the final design chosen served only certain parts of the metro area and did not include Old San Juan. The name &quot;Tren Urbano&quot; (Urban Train) was chosen for the system. In 1993, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) selected it as a Turnkey Demonstration Project under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. In 1996 and 1997, seven design-build contracts were awarded for different segments of the Tren Urbano Phase 1 system.

A number of companies shared the tasks for building the Tren Urbano including Siemens AG, which was granted a concession to design and build the line and its rolling stock and to operate it for the first five years. The company won a contract in July 1996, the first of its kind in North America.

====Construction====

The construction project was plagued by delays, contractual disputes between the government and companies involved in the undertaking, and investigations into possible mismanagement of funds. The project cost was US$2.28 billion.
====Free service====
The rail system was officially inaugurated on . Free service was then offered on weekends until April 2005, when weekdays were added to the free service. Popularity grew quickly, and by the end of the free period, 40,000 people were using the train on a daily basis. By late 2005, however, ridership had fallen to 24,000, well below the projection of 110,000 for 2010.

====Paid service====
Paid fare service started on . In 2006, average weekday boardings stood at 28,179 and in 2007, ridership decreased to 27,567. By the third quarter of 2008, average weekday ridership had increased to 36,500.

====Issues and concerns====
The Tren Urbano has no service to Old San Juan, Santurce, Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport or to many other parts of Guaynabo, Bayamón, and San Juan, and it does not serve important suburbs like Cataño, Toa Baja, Toa Alta, Carolina, Trujillo Alto, and Canóvanas, limiting ridership. Some question the viability of the system for additional reasons, such as the lack of an island-wide public-transportation system, such as the T.U.S.C.A. system proposed in 1971. The inner-city public bus transportation system, the Metropolitan Bus Authority (AMA), which operates in the Greater San Juan Metro Area, is considered unreliable by most people, and does not have a regular schedule. Integration with other transit systems, such as the AMA and the AcuaExpreso (an urban ferry), was initially poor and remains a challenge for the DTOP.

====COVID-19 crisis====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, services on the Tren Urbano were halted by executive order to stop the spread of the virus.

== Route ==

Tren Urbano operates on a single route through mostly suburban areas. The line has 16 stations, ten of which are elevated, four at grade or in open cuttings, and two underground. All stations are designed to handle three permanently-coupled pairs (6 cars). The stations in the system are:

* Sagrado Corazón (Sagrado Corazón)
* Hato Rey (Golden Mile / José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum)
* Roosevelt (Roosevelt Ave. and Ponce de León Ave.)
* Domenech (Hato Rey)
* Piñero (Hato Rey)
* Universidad (University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras)
* Río Piedras (Río Piedras)
* Cupey
* Centro Médico (Puerto Rico Medical Services Administration and University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus)
* San Francisco (535 parking spaces)
* Las Lomas
* Martínez Nadal (1,200 parking spaces)
* Torrimar (Guaynabo) (45 parking spaces)
* Jardines (128 parking spaces)
* Deportivo (Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium and Coliseo Rubén Rodríguez)
* Bayamón (Bayamón) (400 parking spaces)

Each station boasts unique artwork and architectural style.

=== Fares ===

A single trip costs $1.50 ($0.75 if customers transfer from an AMA bus), including a 1-hour bus transfer period. If a customer exits the station and wants to get back on the train, the full fare must be re-paid; there is no train-to-train transfer period. Students and seniors (aged 60–74) pay 75 cents per trip. Senior citizens older than 75 and children under 6 ride for free. Several unlimited-ride passes are also available.

A stored-value multi-use farecard may be used for travel on buses and trains. The value on the card is automatically deducted each time that it is used. The system is similar to the MetroCard system used in New York City.

=== Rolling stock ===

Tren Urbano&#x27;s fleet consists of 74 stainless steel-bodied cars, each long. Each vehicle carries 72 seated and 108 standing passengers. Trains are caoable of a maximum speed of but average during regular operation, including stops. All cars operate as married pairs, and up to three pairs run together at any given time. Tren Urbano operates 15 trains during rush hours, with the remaining cars serving as spares. The rolling stock was assembled at the Siemens plant in Florin, California.

Power is provided by AC traction motors, which were chosen over DC since they contain fewer moving parts and require less maintenance. The trains share many characteristics with the stock built by Siemens for MBTA&#x27;s Blue Line route (700 series). The system is electrified by third rail at 750 V DC.

Air-conditioning systems have been specially designed to cope with the hot and muggy conditions that are commonly experienced in the metropolitan area.

A yellow powered flat car is visible at the maintenance facility. Some metro cars have been used to transport material when they are not in service.

=== Tren Urbano facilities===
Rolling stock for Tren Urbano metro cars are stored at the Hogar del Niño Operations and Maintenance Building, near the exit to PR-21 from PR-20 and a short distance from Martínez Nadal station. The metro cars are stored on outdoor tracks.

Both Bayamón and Sagrado Corazon stations have terminal tracks with capacity to store two train sets.

=== Bus terminals ===

The bus system in the San Juan metropolitan area has been reoriented around the Tren Urbano. Five train stations also serve as bus terminals: Sagrado Corazón, Piñero, Cupey, Martínez Nadal, and Bayamón.

== Expansion plans ==
The infrastructure of the Tren Urbano, with stations built for six–car train sets and a minimum headway of 90 seconds, has a maximum capacity of 40,000 passengers per hour per direction, compared to 3,000 passengers per hour per direction for the current peak hour 8 minute headway and 4-car trains and to an actual daily ridership of roughly 40,000. The system thus operates at 13% capacity, well under the 110,000 rail passengers planned by 2010.
With a fleet of 74 rail vehicles in the local yard to cover at least twice the 10.7-mile (17.2-km) system length, the basic facilities and capital equipment needed for expansion are in place. The system was originally intended to include higher-density areas of the central district, which would make operations more successful and sustainable.

The Puerto Rico&#x27;s Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) has identified the following future phases:

=== Phase 1A ===
* Phase 1A includes the extension of the original line westward from the current terminal at Sagrado Corazón (Sacred Heart) through a medium- to high-density corridor with two stations: San Mateo to a new terminal at Minillas at the heart of Santurce, a distance of 1,500 meters, with a possible transfer from Minillas to a future tram line from the historic district of Old San Juan to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. Phase 1A was approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
* By the end of fiscal 2008, the legislature identified federal funds for the expansion of the train in its second phase. It was expected that during fiscal year 2009, the legislature would begin to issue bonds for that purpose. , there are no plans to expand Tren Urbano.

=== Phase 2 ===
* Upon opening of the Tren Urbano, there were further proposals to extend the rail system to other municipalities such as Carolina. A two-way tunnel, 136 ft (42 meters) long, south of the Río Piedras Station is already built for a future expansion along the heavily-transited 65th Infantry Avenue.
* In 2012, the government informed that it had no plans to expand the Tren Urbano in the future and that it was considering other alternatives to help alleviate traffic.

=== Phase 3 ===

* In 2016, Tren Urbano contracted ACI-Herzog, a joint venture of ACI and Herzog, to improve the reliability and performance of the propulsion system. ACI-Herzog then successfully collaborated with AmePower to achieve this goal by conducting a modernization of 74 Tren Urbano train cars using Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) technology. The project was completed in March 2017.

=== Other projects ===
There are several projects to improve public transport connectivity:

* Also being considered (2008) is a tramway from Sagrado Corazón station to colonial Old San Juan in Puerta de Tierra, where many of Puerto Rico&#x27;s state government buildings are located. It would run partially on an existing right-of-way on Fernández Juncos Ave. The first line of the tramway would be built by the Municipality of San Juan (MSJ) and will be known as the &quot;Sistema de Asistencia, Transportación y Organización Urbana&quot; (System of Assistance, Transportation and Urban Organization) (SATOUR).
* There is a proposal to build a second tram line to Carolina, possibly with a station at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport.
* The extension of a line to Caguas from the Centro Médico or Cupey stations has been considered.
* A second plan for the development of a line to Caguas with a new &quot;Light regional railcar&quot; network system would have future extensions throughout the island.

<doc id="284003" wikidata="Q185963" url="?curid=284003" title="Neutral country">
<text>A neutral country is a state that is neutral towards belligerents in a specific war or holds itself as permanently neutral in all future conflicts (including avoiding entering into military alliances such as NATO, CSTO or the SCO). As a type of non-combatant status, nationals of neutral countries enjoy protection under the law of war from belligerent actions to a greater extent than other non-combatants such as enemy civilians and prisoners of war. Different countries interpret their neutrality differently: some, such as Costa Rica have demilitarized, while Switzerland holds to &quot;armed neutrality&quot;, to deter aggression with a sizeable military, while barring itself from foreign deployment.

Not all neutral countries avoid any foreign deployment or alliances, as Austria and Ireland have active UN peacekeeping forces and a political alliance within the European Union. Sweden&#x27;s traditional policy was not to participate in military alliances, with the intention of staying neutral in the case of war. Immediately before World War II, the Nordic countries stated their neutrality, but Sweden changed its position to that of non-belligerent at the start of the Winter War. Sweden would uphold its policy of neutrality until the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. During the Cold War, former Yugoslavia claimed military and ideological neutrality from both the Western and Eastern Bloc, becoming a co-founder of the Non-Aligned Movement.

There have been considerable changes to the interpretation of neutral conduct over the past centuries.

== Terminology ==
* A &quot;neutral country&quot; in a particular war, is a sovereign state which refrains from joining either side of the conflict and adheres to the principle of the Law of Neutrality under international law. Although countries have historically often declared themselves as neutral at the outbreak of war, there is no obligation for them to do so. The rights and duties of a neutral power are defined in sections 5 and 13 of the Hague Convention of 1907.
* A &quot;permanently neutral power&quot; is a sovereign state which is bound by international treaty, or by its own declaration, to be neutral towards the belligerents of all future wars. An example of a permanently neutral power is Switzerland. The concept of neutrality in war is narrowly defined and puts specific constraints on the neutral party in return for the internationally recognized right to remain neutral.
* &quot;Neutralism&quot; or a &quot;neutralist policy&quot; is a foreign policy position wherein a state intends to remain neutral in future wars. A sovereign state that reserves the right to become a belligerent if attacked by a party to the war is in a condition of armed neutrality.
* A non-belligerent state is one that indirectly participates in a war by politically or materially helping one side of the conflict and thus not participating militarily. For example, it may allow its territory to be used for the war effort. Contrary to neutrality, this term is not defined under international law.

== Rights and responsibilities of a neutral power ==
Belligerents may not invade neutral territory, and a neutral power&#x27;s resisting any such attempt does not compromise its neutrality.

A neutral power must intern belligerent troops who reach its territory, but not escaped prisoners of war. Belligerent armies may not recruit neutral citizens, but they may go abroad to enlist. Belligerent armies&#x27; personnel and materiel may not be transported across neutral territory, but the wounded may be. A neutral power may supply communication facilities to belligerents, but not war materiel, although it need not prevent export of such materiel.

Belligerent naval vessels may use neutral ports for a maximum of 24 hours, though neutrals may impose different restrictions. Exceptions are to make repairs—only the minimum necessary to put back to sea—or if an opposing belligerent&#x27;s vessel is already in port, in which case it must have a 24-hour head start. A prize ship captured by a belligerent in the territorial waters of a neutral power must be surrendered by the belligerent to the neutral, which must intern its crew.

==Recognition and codification==
Neutrality has been recognised in different ways, and sometimes involves a formal guarantor. For example, Switzerland and Belgium&#x27;s neutrality was recognized by the signatories of the Congress of Vienna, Austria has its neutrality guaranteed by its four former occupying powers, and Finland by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The form of recognition varies, often by bilateral treaty (Finland), multilateral treaty (Austria) or a UN declaration (Turkmenistan). These treaties can in some ways be forced on a country (Austria&#x27;s neutrality was insisted upon by the Soviet Union) but in other cases it is an active policy of the country concerned to respond to a geopolitical situation (Ireland in the Second World War).

For the country concerned, the policy is usually codified beyond the treaty itself. Austria and Japan codify their neutrality in their constitutions, but they do so with different levels of detail. Some details of neutrality are left to be interpreted by the government while others are explicitly stated; for example, Austria may not host any foreign bases, and Japan cannot participate in foreign wars. Yet Sweden, lacking formal codification, was more flexible during the Second World War in allowing troops to pass through its territory.

==Armed neutrality==

Armed neutrality is the posture of a state or group of states that has no alliance with either side of a war but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from any party, making the benefit to a belligerent of entering the country by force not worth the cost.

This may include:
*Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime, and the readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
*Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics for the attitude of a state or group of states that makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power during a war to hold itself ready to resist by force, any aggression of either belligerent.
*Armed neutrality makes a seemingly-neutral state take up arms for protection to maintain its neutrality.

The term derives from the historic maritime neutrality of the First League of Armed Neutrality of the Nordic countries and Russia under the leadership of Catherine the Great, which was invented in the late 18th century but has since been used only to refer to countries&#x27; neutralities. Sweden and Switzerland are independently of each other famed for their armed neutralities, which they maintained throughout both World War I and World War II. The Swiss and the Swedes each have a long history of neutrality: they have not been in a state of war internationally since 1815 and 1814, respectively. Switzerland continues to pursue, however, an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world. According to Edwin Reischauer, &quot;To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden.&quot; Sweden ended its policy of neutrality when it joined NATO in 2024.

In contrast, some neutral states may heavily reduce their military and use it for the express purpose of home defense and the maintenance of their neutrality, while other neutral states may abandon military power altogether (examples of states doing this include Liechtenstein). However, the lack of a military does not always result in neutrality: Countries such as Costa Rica and Iceland replaced their standing army with a military guarantee from a stronger power or participation in a mutual defense pact (under TIAR and NATO respectively).

=== Leagues of armed neutrality ===
*The First League of Armed Neutrality was an alliance of minor naval powers organized in 1780 by Catherine II of Russia to protect neutral shipping during the American Revolutionary War. The establishment of the First League of Armed Neutrality was viewed by Americans as a mark of Russian friendship and sympathy. This league had a lasting impact of Russian-American relations and the relations of those two powers and Britain. It was also the basis for international maritime law, which is still in effect. In the field of political science, this is the first historical example of armed neutrality, however, scholars like Carl Kulsrud argue that the concept of armed neutrality was introduced even earlier. Within 90 years before the First League of Armed Neutrality was established, neutral powers had joined forces no less than three times. As early as 1613, Lubeck and Holland joined powers to continue their maritime exploration without the commitment of being involved in wartime struggles on the sea.
*The Second League of Armed Neutrality was an effort to revive this during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was an alliance with Denmark-Norway, Prussia, Sweden and Russia. It existed between 1800 and 1801. The idea of the league was to protect neutral shipping from being stopped by the British Royal Navy. The British viewed the league as siding with the French and in 1801 attacked and defeated a Dano-Norwegian fleet in the Battle of Copenhagen. After the death of the Russian Tsar Paul I in the same year, the league collapsed.
*A potential Third League of Armed Neutrality was discussed during the American Civil War, but was never realized.

==Peacekeeping==

For many states, such as Ireland, neutrality does not mean the absence of any foreign interventionism. Peacekeeping missions for the United Nations are seen as intertwined with it. The Swiss electorate rejected a 1994 proposal to join UN peacekeeping operations. Despite this, 23 Swiss observers and police have been deployed around the world in UN projects.

==Points of debate==
The legitimacy of whether some states are as neutral as they claim has been questioned in some circles, although this depends largely on a state&#x27;s interpretation of its form of neutrality.

===European Union=== 

There are three members of the European Union that still describe themselves as a neutral country in some form: Austria, Ireland, and Malta. With the development of the EU&#x27;s Common Security and Defence Policy, the extent to which they are, or should be neutral is debated. 

For example, Ireland, which sought guarantees for its neutrality in EU treaties, argues that its neutrality does not mean that Ireland should avoid engagement in international affairs such as peacekeeping operations.

Since the enactment of the Lisbon Treaty, EU members are bound by , which obliges states to assist a fellow member that is the victim of armed aggression. It accords
&quot;an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in [other member states&#x27;] power&quot; but would &quot;not prejudice the specific character of the security and defense policy of certain Member States&quot; (neutral policies), allowing members to respond with non-military aid. Ireland&#x27;s constitution prohibits participating in such a common defence.

With the launch of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in defense at the end of 2017, the EU&#x27;s activity on military matters has increased. The policy was designed to be inclusive and allows states to opt in or out of specific forms of military cooperation. That has allowed most of the neutral states to participate, but opinions still vary. Some members of the Irish Parliament considered Ireland&#x27;s joining PESCO as an abandonment of neutrality. It was passed with the government arguing that its opt-in nature allowed Ireland to &quot;join elements of PESCO that were beneficial such as counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and peacekeeping... what we are not going to be doing is buying aircraft carriers and fighter jets&quot;. Malta, as of December 2017, is the only neutral state not to participate in PESCO. The Maltese government argued that it was going to wait and see how PESCO develops to see whether it would compromise Maltese neutrality.

=== Neutrality during World War II ===
Many countries made neutrality declarations during World War II. However, of the European states closest to the war, only Andorra, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland (with Liechtenstein), and Vatican City (the Holy See) remained neutral to the end.

Their fulfillment to the letter of the rules of neutrality has been questioned: Ireland supplied important secret information to the Allies; for instance, the date of D-Day was decided on the basis of incoming Atlantic weather information, some of it supplied by Ireland but kept from Germany. Ireland also secretly allowed Allied aircraft to use the Donegal Corridor, making it possible for British planes to attack German U-boats in the mid-Atlantic. On the other hand, both Axis and Allied pilots who crash landed in Ireland were interned.

Sweden and Switzerland, surrounded by possessions and allies of Nazi Germany similarly made concessions to Nazi requests as well as to Allied requests. Sweden was also involved in intelligence operations with the Allies, including listening stations in Sweden and espionage in Germany. Spain offered to join the war on the side of Nazi Germany in 1940, allowed Axis ships and submarines to use its ports, imported war materials for Germany, and sent a Spanish volunteer combat division to aid the Nazi war effort. Portugal officially stayed neutral, but actively supported both the Allies by providing overseas naval bases, and Germany by selling tungsten.

The United States was initially neutral and bound by the Neutrality Acts of 1936 not to sell war materials to belligerents. Once war broke out, US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt persuaded Congress to replace the act with the Cash and carry program that allowed the US to provide military aid to the allies, despite opposition from non-interventionist members. The &quot;Cash and carry&quot; program was replaced in March 1941 by Lend-Lease, effectively ending the US pretense of neutrality.

Sweden also made concessions to the German Reich during the war to maintain its neutrality, the biggest concession was to let the 163rd German Infantry Division to be transferred from Norway to Finland by Swedish trains, to aid the Finns in the Continuation War. The decision caused a political &quot;Midsummer Crisis&quot; of 1941, about Sweden&#x27;s neutrality.

Equally, Vatican City made various diplomatic concessions to the Axis and Allied powers alike, while still keeping to the rules of the Law of Neutrality. The Holy See has been criticized—but largely exonerated later—for its silence on moral issues of the war.

=== Imperialism and anti-imperialism ===
Neutrality and neutral countries have been an important but also challenging element in the history of imperialist power-play, as a space for the formation of internationalism and various anti-imperialisms.

=== Class action lawsuit in the US ===
On 14 February 2006, the US law firm Lieff Cabraser filed a nationwide class action lawsuit against TCS concerning payments to employees on deputation. This lawsuit was filed on behalf of all non-US citizens employed by TCS in California from 14 February 2002 to 30 June 2005. The workers alleged that they were compelled to forfeit their federal and state tax refunds to their employer and that their Indian salaries were wrongfully deducted from their US pay. On 22 February 2013, TCS agreed to settle the class-action suit for $30 million. In July 2013, Judge Claudia Wilken of the US District Court, Northern District of California in Oakland, California, granted final approval for the settlement of the lawsuit.

=== Trade secret lawsuit ===
In a lawsuit filed in October 2014 in the US District Court in Madison, Epic Systems accused TCS and Tata America International Corp of &quot;brazenly stealing the trade secrets, confidential information, documents, and data&quot; belonging to Epic. This lawsuit was amended in January and December 2015. In April 2016, a US jury imposed a US$940 million fine on TCS and Tata America International Corp in the trade secret case, which was reduced to US$420 million in 2017. In 2020, an appeals court ruled that the US$280 million in punitive damages was &quot;constitutionally excessive&quot;, but upheld the remaining portion of US$140 million in compensatory damages. The case concluded in November 2023, with TCS agreeing to pay US$125 million.

=== Sexual harassment allegations ===
In 2019, an employee filed a complaint with the Kancheepuram labour court, alleging that Tata Consultancy Services&#x27; internal complaints committee mishandled a sexual harassment case. Despite the case being approved, there has been no significant progress over the years, with the worker accusing the company of delaying investigations. The worker has also reported unexplained transfers and other forms of alleged workplace retribution, including in performance reviews.

<text>A number of peace symbols have been used many ways in various cultures and contexts. The dove and olive branch was used symbolically by early Christians and then eventually became a secular peace symbol, popularized by a &quot;Dove&quot; lithograph by Pablo Picasso after World War II. In the 1950s, the &quot;peace sign&quot;, as it is known today (also known as &quot;peace and love&quot;), was designed by Gerald Holtom as the logo for the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), a group at the forefront of the peace movement in the UK, and adopted by anti-war and counterculture activists in the US and elsewhere. The symbol is a of the semaphore signals for the letters &quot;N&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, taken to stand for &quot;nuclear disarmament&quot;, while simultaneously acting as a reference to Goya&#x27;s &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot; (1814) (aka &quot;Peasant Before the Firing Squad&quot;).

The V hand signal and the peace flag also became international peace symbols.

==Olive branch==

===Classical antiquity===
The use of the olive branch as a symbol of peace in Western civilization dates at least to 5th century BC Greece. The olive branch, which the Greeks believed represented plenty and drove away evil spirits, was one of the attributes of Eirene, the Greek goddess of peace. Eirene (whom the Romans called Pax), appeared on Roman Imperial coins with an olive branch.

The Roman poet Virgil (70–10 BC) associated &quot;the plump olive&quot; with Pax and he used the olive branch as a symbol of peace in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;High on the stern Aeneas his stand,
And held a branch of olive in his hand,
While thus he spoke: &quot;The Phrygians&#x27; arms you see,
Expelled from Troy, provoked in Italy
By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;
At first affianced, and at last betrayed.
This message bear: The Trojans and their chief
Bring holy peace, and beg the king&#x27;s relief.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The Romans believed there was an intimate relationship between war and peace. Mars, the god of war, had another aspect, Mars Pacifer, Mars the bringer of Peace, who is shown on coins of the later Roman Empire bearing an olive branch. Appian describes the use of the olive-branch as a gesture of peace by the enemies of the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus in the Numantine War and by Hasdrubal of Carthage.

===Later representations===
Poets of the 17th century associated the olive branch with peace. A Charles I gold coin of 1644 shows the monarch with sword and olive branch. Throughout the 18th century, English coins show Britannia with a spear and olive branch.

The Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, contains an allegorical painting by James Thornhill, &quot;Peace and Liberty Triumphing Over Tyranny&quot; (1708–1716), depicting King William III and Queen Mary (who had enacted the English Bill of Rights) enthroned in heaven with the Virtues behind them. Peace, with her doves and lambs, hands an olive branch to William, who in turn hands the cap of liberty to Europe, where absolute monarchy prevails. Below William is the defeated French king, Louis XIV.

In January 1775, the frontispiece of the &quot;London Magazine&quot; published an engraving of Peace descending on a cloud from the Temple of Commerce, bringing an olive branch to America and Britannia. In July that year, the American Continental Congress adopted the &quot;Olive Branch Petition&quot; in the hope of avoiding a full-blown war with Great Britain.

On the Great Seal of the United States (1782), the olive branch denotes peace, as explained by Charles Thomson, Secretary to Congress: &quot;The Olive branch and arrows denote the power of peace &amp; war which is exclusively vested in Congress.&quot;

==Dove and olive branch==

===Christianity===

The use of a dove as a symbol of peace originated with early Christians, who portrayed baptism accompanied by a dove, often on their sepulchres.

The New Testament compared the dove to the Spirit of God that descended on Jesus during his baptism. Christians saw similarities between baptism and Noah&#x27;s Flood. The First Epistle of Peter (composed around the end of the first century AD) said that the Flood, which brought salvation through water, prefigured baptism. Tertullian () compared the dove, who &quot;announced to the world the assuagement of divine wrath, when she had been sent out of the ark and returned with the olive branch, to the Holy Spirit who descends in baptism in the form of a dove that brings the peace of God, sent out from the heavens&quot;.

At first the dove represented the subjective personal experience of peace, the peace of the soul, and in the earliest Christian art it accompanies representations of baptism. By the end of the second century (for example in the writing of Tertullian) it also represented social and political peace, &quot;peace unto the nations&quot;, and from the third century it began to appear in depictions of conflict, such as Noah and the Ark, Daniel and the lions, the three young men in the furnace, and Susannah and the Elders.

The dove appears in Christian inscriptions in the Roman catacombs, sometimes accompanied by the words (Latin for ). For example, in the Catacomb of Callixtus, a dove and branch are drawn next to a Latin inscription , meaning In another example, a shallow relief sculpture shows a dove with a branch flying to a figure marked in Greek as (, or ). The symbol has also been found in the Christian catacombs of Sousse, Tunisia (ancient Carthage), which date from the end of the first century AD.

The Christian symbolism of the olive branch, invariably carried by the dove, derives from Greek usage and the story of Noah in the Hebrew Bible. The story of Noah ends with a dove bringing a freshly plucked olive leaf (Hebrew: ), a sign of life after the Flood and of God&#x27;s bringing Noah, his family and the animals to land. Rabbinic literature interpreted the olive leaf as &quot;the young shoots of the Land of Israel&quot; or the dove&#x27;s preference for bitter food in God&#x27;s service, rather than sweet food in the service of men. Neither represented peace in Jewish thought, but the dove and olive branch acquired that meaning in Christianity.

Before the Peace of Constantine (313 AD), in which Rome ceased its persecution of Christians following Constantine&#x27;s conversion, Noah was normally shown in an attitude of prayer, a dove flying toward him or alighting on his outstretched hand. According to Graydon Snyder, &quot;The Noah story afforded the early Christian community an opportunity to express piety and peace in a vessel that withstood the threatening environment&quot; of Roman persecution. According to Ludwig Budde and Pierre Prigent, the dove referred to the descending of the Holy Spirit rather than the peace associated with Noah. After the Peace of Constantine, when persecution ceased, Noah appeared less frequently in Christian art.

In the fourth century, St. Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible translated the Hebrew in the Noah story as , (), possibly reflecting the Christian equivalence between the peace brought by baptism and peace brought by the ending of the Flood. By the fifth century, St Augustine confirmed the Christian adoption of the olive branch as a symbol of peace, writing that, &quot;perpetual peace is indicated by the olive branch (Latin: ) that the dove brought with it when it returned to the ark.&quot;

Medieval illuminated manuscripts, such as the Holkham Bible, showed the dove returning to Noah with a branch. Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible, which translated the Vulgate into English in the 14th century, uses &quot;&quot; (&quot;a branch of olive tree with green leaves&quot;) in Gen. 8:11. In the Middle Ages, some Jewish manuscripts, which were often illustrated by Christians, also showed Noah&#x27;s dove with an olive branch, for example, the Golden Haggadah (about 1420).

English Bibles from the 17th-century King James Bible onwards, which translated the story of Noah direct from Hebrew, render the Hebrew as rather than , but by this time the association of the dove with an olive branch as a symbol of peace in the story of Noah was firmly established.

===Secular representations===
* Late 15th century In the late 15th century, a dove with an olive branch was used on the seal of , the Florentine committee known as The Ten of Liberty and Peace, whose secretary was Machiavelli; it bore the motto (Peace and the Defence of Liberty).
* Late 18th century In 18th-century America, a £2 note of North Carolina (1771) depicted the dove and olive with a motto meaning: &quot;Peace restored&quot;. Georgia&#x27;s $40 note of 1778 portrayed the dove and olive and a hand holding a dagger, with a motto meaning &quot;Either war or peace, prepared for both.&quot;
* Early 19th century The Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace, also known as The London Peace Society, formed on a Quaker initiative in 1816, used the symbol of a dove and olive branch.
* Early 20th century A German war loan poster of 1917 showed the head of an eagle over a dove of peace in flight, with the text, &quot;Subscribe to the War Loan&quot;.
* Mid-20th century Picasso&#x27;s lithograph, &quot;La Colombe&quot; (The Dove), a traditional, realistic picture of a pigeon, without an olive branch, was chosen as the emblem for the World Peace Council in Paris in April 1949. The dove became a symbol for the peace movement and the ideals of the Communist Party and was used in Communist demonstrations of the period. At the 1950 World Peace Council in Sheffield, Picasso said that his father had taught him to paint doves, concluding, &quot;I stand for life against death; I stand for peace against war.&quot; At the 1952 World Peace Council in Berlin, Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Dove&quot; was depicted in a banner above the stage. The dove symbol was used extensively in the post-war peace movement. Anti-communists had their own take on the peace dove: the group distributed posters titled (), showing the peace dove metamorphosing into a Soviet tank.

==Broken rifle==

The broken rifle symbol is used by War Resisters&#x27; International (WRI) and its affiliates but predates the foundation of WRI in 1921. The first known example of the symbol is in the masthead of the January 1909 issue of (Down with Weapons), the monthly paper of the International Antimilitarist Union in the Netherlands. In 1915 it appeared on the cover of a pamphlet, (Under the Broken Rifle), published by the Norwegian Social Democratic Youth Association. The (German) League for War Victims, founded in 1917, used the broken rifle on a 1919 banner.

In 1921, Belgian workers marching through La Louvrière on 16 October 1921, carried flags showing a soldier breaking his rifle. Ernst Friedrich, a German who had refused military service, founded the Anti-Kriegs Museum in Berlin, which featured a bas-relief broken rifle over the door. The museum distributed broken-rifle badges, girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s brooches, boys&#x27; belt buckles, and men&#x27;s tie pins.

==White poppy==

In 1933, during a period in which there was widespread fear of war in Europe, the Women&#x27;s Co-operative Guild began the practice of distributing white poppies as an alternative to the red poppies distributed by the Royal British Legion in commemoration of servicemen who died in the First World War. In 1934 the newly formed Peace Pledge Union (PPU), which was the largest British peace organization in the inter-war years, joined in distributing white poppies and laying white poppy wreaths &quot;as a pledge to peace that war must not happen again&quot;. In 1980, the PPU revived the symbol as a way of remembering the victims of war without glorifying militarism.

==Roerich&#x27;s peace banner==


Nicholas Roerich (1874–1947), a Russian artist, cultural activist, and philosopher, founded a movement to protect cultural artifacts. Its symbol was a maroon-on-white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. It has also been used as a peace banner. In 1935 a pact initiated by Roerich was signed by the United States and Latin American nations, agreeing that &quot;historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions&quot; should be protected both in times of peace and war.

According to the Roerich Museum,

The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today.

==Peace symbol==

The symbol now known internationally as the &quot;peace symbol&quot; or &quot;peace sign&quot;, was created in 1958 as a symbol for Britain&#x27;s campaign for nuclear disarmament. It went on to be widely adopted in the American anti-war movement in the 1960s and was re-interpreted as generically representing world peace. It was also used by activists opposing nuclear power in the 1980s, although the Smiling Sun image () [&quot;Nuclear power? No thanks!]&quot; predominated.

===Origin===
The symbol was designed by Gerald Holtom (1914–1985), who presented it to Direct Action Committee on 21 February 1958. It was &quot;immediately accepted&quot; as a symbol for the movement and used for a march from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire on 4 April. Holtom&#x27;s design was adapted by Eric Austen (1922–1999) to ceramic lapel badges. The original design is in the Peace Museum in Bradford, England.

The symbol is a super-imposition of the flag semaphore for the characters &quot;N&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, taken to stand for &quot;nuclear disarmament&quot;.
This observation was made as early as 5 April 1958 in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. In addition to this primary genesis, Holtom additionally cited as inspiration Francisco Goya&#x27;s painting &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot; :

I was in despair. Deep despair. I drew myself: the representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya&#x27;s peasant before the firing squad. I formalised the drawing into a line and put a circle round it.

Ken Kolsbun, a correspondent of Holtom&#x27;s, says that the designer came to regret the symbolism of despair, as he felt that peace was something to be celebrated and wanted the symbol to be inverted. Eric Austen is said to have &quot;discovered that the &#x27;gesture of despair&#x27; motif had long been associated with &#x27;the death of man&#x27;, and the circle with &#x27;the unborn child&#x27;.

The symbol became the badge of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and wearing it became a sign of support for the campaign that argued for British unilateral nuclear disarmament. An account of CND&#x27;s early history described the image as &quot;a visual adhesive to bind the [Aldermaston] March and later the whole Campaign together ... probably the most powerful, memorable and adaptable image ever designed for a secular cause&quot;.

===International reception===
Not copyrighted, trademarked or restricted, the symbol spread beyond CND and was adopted by the wider disarmament and anti-war movements. It became widely known in the United States in 1958 when Albert Bigelow, a pacifist protester, sailed a small boat fitted with the CND banner into the vicinity of a nuclear test. Buttons with the symbol were imported into the United States in 1960 by Philip Altbach, a freshman at the University of Chicago. Altbach had traveled to England to meet with British peace groups as a delegate from the Student Peace Union (SPU) and, on his return, he persuaded the SPU to adopt the symbol. 

Between 1960 and 1964, they sold thousands of the buttons on college campuses. By 1968, the symbol had been adopted as a generic peace sign, 
associated especially with the hippie movement and opposition to the Vietnam War.

In 1970, two US private companies tried to register the peace symbol as a trade mark: the Intercontinental Shoe Corporation of New York and Luv, Inc. of Miami. Commissioner of Patents William E. Schuyler Jr, said that the symbol &quot;could not properly function as a trade mark subject to registration by the Patent Office&quot;.

In 1973, the South African government tried to ban its use by opponents of apartheid.

===Interpretations===
Gerald Holtom had originally considered using a Christian cross symbol within a circle, but he was dissuaded by several priests who expressed reservations towards using the cross on a protest march. Holtom&#x27;s symbol was nevertheless compared to the Christian cross symbol, as well as to the death rune (the inverted ᛘ rune associated with death in early 20th century esotericism).

In 1968, the anti-Communist evangelist Billy James Hargis described the symbol as a &quot;broken cross&quot;, which he claimed represented the antichrist. Hargis&#x27; interpretation was taken up by a member of the John Birch Society, Marjorie Jensen, who wrote a pamphlet claiming the symbol was equivalent to &quot;a symbol of the devil, with the cross reversed and broken&quot; supposedly known as &quot;the crow&#x27;s foot or witch&#x27;s foot&quot;. In June 1970, &quot;American Opinion&quot;, the journal of the John Birch Society, published an article which compared the symbol to a supposed &quot;broken cross&quot; claimed to have been &quot;carried by the Moors when they invaded Spain in the 8th century&quot;. The newsletter of the National Republican Congressional Committee of 28 September 1970 on its question page made the comparison to a design of a &quot;death rune&quot; in a wreath published by the German Nazi party as representing (heroic) death, in 1942. &quot;Time&quot; magazine in its 2 November 1970 issue made note of these comparisons, pointing out that any such resemblance was &quot;probably coincidental&quot;.

==Rainbow flag==

The international peace flag in the colours of the rainbow was first used in Italy on a 1961 peace march from Perugia to Assisi organized by the pacifist and social philosopher Aldo Capitini (1899–1968). Inspired by the peace flags used on British peace marches, Capitini got some women of Perugia hurriedly to sew together coloured strips of material. The march has been repeated many times since 1961, including in 2010. The original flag was kept by Capitini&#x27;s collaborator, Lanfranco Mencaroni, at Collevalenza, near Todi. In 2011, plans were announced to transfer it to the Palazzo dei Priori in Perugia.

The flag commonly has seven rainbow-colored stripes with the word (Italian for ) in the center. It has been explained as follows:
In the account of the Great Flood, God set the rainbow to a seal the alliance with man and nature, promising that there will never be another Flood. The rainbow thus became a symbol of Peace across the earth and the sky, and, by extension, among all men.

The flag usually has the colours violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red from top to bottom, but some have the violet stripe below the blue one (as in the picture at the right) or a white one at the top. A picture of Capitini&#x27;s first peace flag, carried by Anna Capitini and Silvana Mencaroni, shows the colours red, orange, white, green, violet, indigo, and lavender.

In 2002, renewed display of the flag was widespread with the () campaign, a protest against the impending war in Iraq planned by the United States and its allies. In 2003, the Italian newspaper reported leading advertising executives saying that the peace flag had become more popular than the Italian national flag. In November 2009, a huge peace flag, 21m wide by 40m long, was made in Lecce, Salento, by young members of &quot;GPACE Youth for Peace Give Peace a Chance Everywhere&quot;.

== Predator and prey lie down together ==
The imagery of a predator and prey lying down together in peace is depicted in the Bible:

One of the first coins to be minted was the croeseid. It depicted the Lydian Lion and Hellenic Bull, representing the peaceful alliance between Croesus and the dynasty of Agamemnon enthroned in Cyme. This alliance had been sealed through two royal marriages, Hermodike I to the Phrygian king Midas and Hermodike II to Alyattes of Lydia. Alyattes was Croesus&#x27; father and Hermodike II was likely his mother. When he came to power, Croesus minted the first coin depicting two animals. The roaring lion symbol of Lydia and the bull symbol of Hellenic Zeus (from the Seduction of Europa) are facing each other in truce. The imagery of a predator and prey lying down together in peace is reflected in other ancient literature, e.g. &quot;...the calf and the lion and the yearling together...&quot; (Isaiah 11:6, see above). The croeseid symbolism of peace between the Greeks of Asia Minor, Lydians and later Persians (under Cyrus the Great) persisted long after Croesus&#x27; death until Darius the Great introduced new coins .

The union of Phrygia and Lydia with Aeolian Greeks resulted in regional peace, which facilitated the transfer of ground-breaking technological skills into Ancient Greece; respectively, the phonetic written script and the minting of coinage (to use a token currency, where the value is guaranteed by the state). Both inventions were rapidly adopted by surrounding nations through further trade and cooperation and have been of fundamental benefit to the progress of civilization.

==V sign==


The V sign ( in Unicode) is a hand gesture, palm outwards, with the index and middle fingers open and all others closed. It had been used to represent victory during the Second World War. During the 1960s in the US, activists against the Vietnam War and in subsequent anti-war protests adopted the gesture as a sign of peace.

==Paper cranes==

The crane, a traditional symbol of luck in Japan, was popularized as a peace symbol by the story of Sadako Sasaki (1943–1955), a girl who died as a result of the atomic bomb exploding over Hiroshima in 1945. According to the story, popularized through the book &quot;Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes&quot;, in the last stages of her illness she started folding paper cranes, inspired by the Japanese saying that one who folded a thousand origami cranes was granted a wish. This made an impression in people&#x27;s minds. As a result, she is remembered on every 6 August, which is an annual peace day for people all over Japan.
== Japanese Peace Bell ==


The Japanese Peace Bell is a United Nations peace symbol. Cast on 24 November 1952, it was an official gift of the Japanese people to the United Nations on 8 June 1954. The symbolic bell of peace was donated by Japan to the United Nations at a time when Japan had not yet been officially admitted to the United Nations. The Japanese Peace Bell was presented to the United Nations by the United Nations Association of Japan.

==Shalom/salaam==
A wordmark of the three words, Hebrew word &quot;shalom&quot; (Hebrew: ), together with the Arabic &quot;salaam&quot; (Arabic: ) and the English word &quot;peace&quot; has been used as a peace symbol in the Middle East. &quot;Shalom&quot; and &quot;salaam&quot; mean and are cognates of each other, derived from the Semitic triconsonantal of &quot;S-L-M&quot; (realized in Hebrew as &quot;Š-L-M&quot; and in Arabic as &quot;S-L-M&quot;). The symbol has come to represent peace in the Middle East and an end to the Arab–Israeli conflict. Wall plaques, signs, T-shirts, and buttons are sold with only those words.

<doc id="284015" wikidata="Q1142683" url="?curid=284015" title="List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters">
<text>The Japanese anime television series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; has an extensive cast of characters that were created by Gainax. The show&#x27;s protagonist is Shinji Ikari, a teenage boy whose father Gendo recruits to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant, bio-machine mecha called an Evangelion and fight against beings called Angels.

The character designs were drawn by the artist, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who designed each character to be easily identifiable from their silhouette. The personalities were based on that of Hideaki Anno, the show&#x27;s director and main scriptwriter. Many of the heroes in the second half of the series suffer trauma or physical violence that exacerbates their anxieties and fears, and the episodes give ample space to their inner monologues, in which they question the meaning of their actions and lives. This narrative choice culminates in the two final episodes, whose narrative pivots on Shinji&#x27;s streams of consciousness; the finale, however, does not clearly conclude the plot.

In Japan, the characters received favorable audience reception, becoming the subjects of merchandise and winning popularity polls. Critics had mixed feelings about their psychological exploration; some reviewers appreciated their complexity and depth and praised Anno&#x27;s script, but others found the characters to be stereotypical or problematic, and disliked the insistence on their weaknesses and characterization. The show&#x27;s last two episodes proved to be controversial, since the plot is eclipsed by moments of introspection. &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; characters, especially Rei Ayanami, also inspired later anime series, creating or helping to spread new stereotypes in Japanese animated productions.

==Conception==
The studio Gainax studio chose interpersonal communication as the main theme of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, insisting on portraying inter-generational relationships, such as those between parents and children. The studio wanted to create a series that reflects on the lack of communication in contemporaneous Japanese society, which was considered to be in ruins. The director of the series, Hideaki Anno, an otaku since his youth, experienced depression after the conclusion of his previous anime series, &quot;&quot;, and poured his emotions into &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, making it a reflection of his feelings:

For each character, Anno took cues from a part of his personality, stating that: &quot;All the characters of &quot;Evangelion&quot; are me&quot;. Shinji, for example, was conceived as a mirror of his self: &quot;both the conscious and unconscious part&quot;. According to him, moreover, Kaworu Nagisa and Gendo Ikari represent his shadow, the dark, unconscious side of an individual&#x27;s psyche. Kazuya Tsurumaki, assistant director of the series, stated that the autobiographical intent can also be detected in the female protagonists and secondary characters, such as Misato Katsuragi, Rei Ayanami, and Ryoji Kaji, saying, &quot;Every character is ultimately the same. On the surface, different &#x27;seasonings&#x27; have been used, but inside [the characters] are very similar&quot;. Anno also said Shinji and the other main characters are not to be considered only a mirror of his personal experience but a reflection of the other members of the series&#x27; creative staff as well. According to him, &quot;It&#x27;s strange that &quot;Evangelion&quot; has become such a hit – all the characters are so sick!&quot;

In 1993, about two years before the series aired, the production studio established a temporary lead on the creation of the characters in a presentation document titled . Much of them were already outlined, despite differences in script. Anno did not follow a well-defined plan for the development of the protagonists; he improvised as the episodes passed and following his instincts, as in a &quot;live performance&quot;. The original project also included a girl character named Yui Ichijō who was similar in appearance to Rei but had dark hair; this character never appeared in the final version of the show.

The blood type and date of birth of each character were almost always identical to those of the character&#x27;s voice actor, the exceptions being Toji, Kensuke, Kaworu, and Rei, whose date is never explicitly revealed in the series. Anno named most of the characters after ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II, while others were taken from comic-book characters and the novel by Japanese writer Ryu Murakami, from which the names Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida come. The show&#x27;s character designer was Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who had worked with Anno on &quot;Nadia&quot;; Sadamoto was asked to develop a design with a &quot;relatively subdued appearance&quot;. Sadamoto gave the characters immediately distinguishable features and silhouettes, trying to reflect as much as possible the interior of each of them. Initially, Anno proposed using a female protagonist, following Gainax&#x27; earlier projects &quot;GunBuster&quot; and &quot;Nadia&quot;, but Sadamoto was hesitant about the idea, not understanding &quot;why a girl would want to pilot a robot&quot;. Sadamoto suggested having a male protagonist, Shinji, and Asuka became the show&#x27;s co-protagonist.

===Development===

Anno began working on &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; with the idea the setting and characters would evolve as the story progressed. He continued to rely on his personal experience and avoided depicting &quot;human dramas&quot;, perceiving the task as difficult; he thus preferred to represent &quot;Evangelion&quot; as a &quot;documentary&quot; rather than a drama. While working on the third and fourth episodes, he set the goal of surpassing other television series in development and psychological depth. The first episodes focus on Shinji&#x27;s relationship problems and his constant attempts to approach Rei in &quot;Rei I&quot; and &quot;Rei II&quot;. The creative staff felt dissatisfied with the result, considering it too heavy. To give a different impulse to the second part of the series the irreverent, exuberant character Asuka was inserted in the eighth episode, &quot;Asuka Strikes!&quot;, which is the center of many comic and typically adolescent situations. In the following episodes, despite their communication difficulties, the show&#x27;s protagonists are portrayed with the lightness typical of comedy following a conventional, science-fiction anime scheme. The episode&#x27;s scriptwriter Shinji Higuchi, who is known for the humorous and lighthearted character of his works, intervened and the characters&#x27; development became more positive. In the following episodes, Misato opens up to Shinji and talk to him about her painful past; Asuka shows a sweeter and more-caring character, the cold commander Ikari helps his subordinates and praises his son.

The last episodes would have closed the story and the protagonists&#x27; journey; for the ending the writers originally planned a scene in which Gendo would have said to his son Shinji, similar to the ending of Gainax&#x27;s earlier show &quot;The Secret of Blue Water&quot;, in which Captain Nemo utters the same phrase before sacrificing himself. During the first broadcast of the series, Anno responded to animation fans with anger, accusing them of being excessively closed and introverted; for this reason, he changed the atmosphere of the show&#x27;s second half, making the narrative even darker and more introspective. This change of direction is reflected in the protagonists&#x27; development. While being criticized, Anno decided to make the characters Asuka and Toji undergo physical and psychological violence, which was considered unsuitable for a television show in a protected transmission time.

According to Michael House, native English translator for Gainax, at the beginning Anno had the idea of ending the anime with a scene of Shinji smiling and with the full maturation of the characters, who would be able to establish healthier relationships, but towards the middle of the show, he realized this could not be done in a credible way. Anno would have failed in his intent, creating characters who were too closed and problematic. Asuka, for example, was initially inserted to lighten the tone of the series, and only as the show progressed it was decided to pay attention to her inner fragility. At the same time, breaking a taboo of Japanese television, Anno focused on the sexuality of the protagonists, inserting in the twentieth episode a sequence of implicit sex that includes a long, off-screen shot of Misato making sounds of pleasure in bed with her lover Kaji. The director said he wanted to show the audience, and especially children, how sex and violence are an integral part of human life.

In the show&#x27;s fourteenth episode, Anno wanted to investigate Rei Ayanami, whom he felt he had not adequately explored and with whom he felt less affinity than the other characters. Running out of ideas, an acquaintance of Anno lent him a book on mental illness. Since then, Anno tried to include more concepts from psychology and psychoanalysis into the show. The show&#x27;s main theme thus became the deepening of the human inner lives and reflections on interpersonal communication are depicted through streams of consciousness of the protagonists. Shinji&#x27;s character was deepened through internal monologues, as in the sixteenth and twentieth episodes. The last episodes also suffered from the tight production schedule; they were made in a short time to meet the deadlines. In the twenty-fifth episode, the protagonists undergo a psychoanalysis session in a dark theater, retracing their childhoods through flashbacks. By rewriting the script, Anno focused only on the psychology of the main characters with a special focus on Shinji, completely abandoning the main plot and not offering a clear conclusion to the anime&#x27;s narrative. He tried to deliver a message to and criticism of the otaku world and himself, as a long-time otaku.

==Pilots==
In the Japanese dialogue for the original anime, the Eva pilots are referred to as &quot;children&quot;, even when referring to an individual pilot. The English translation refers to the individual pilots as First Child, etc. In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, the expression &quot;(n)th Children&quot; is not used; instead, the pilots are referred to as , , , or .

===Shinji Ikari===

 is the only son of Gendo Rokubungi and Yui Ikari. Following the early death of his mother, who disappeared in a mysterious accident, his father entrusted Shinji to a guardian. Once Shinji turns fourteen, Gendo calls him back to the city of Tokyo-3 to assume the role of Third Child, a pilot assigned to command Eva-01. Because of his abandonment, Shinji feels unwanted and, according to Hideaki Anno, &quot;abandoned the attempt to understand himself&quot;, convincing himself he is useless. Anno also described him as shy of human contact and unable to commit suicide. Compared to the stereotypical heroes of traditional mecha anime, he is devoid of energy, withdrawn, and pessimistic. After moving to Tokyo-3, Shinji begins to form relationships that influence him positively, especially with other pilots, his classmates, and members of Nerv, such as Misato Katsuragi, his superior and legal guardian, and Ryoji Kaji.

While writing Shinji, the show&#x27;s writers used psychological concepts such as Freudian theories of the oral stage, the porcupine&#x27;s dilemma, and the splitting of the breast. His characterization has been compared to that of Amuro Ray, the protagonist of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, and Japanese otaku. Anime critics associated the character with the youth and climate of 1990s Japan, which was impacted by the Tokyo subway sarin attack, the Great Hanshin earthquake, and the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble, and interpreted him as a messianic figure.

&quot;Unreality Magazine&quot; Nick Verboon described Shinji as &quot;one of the most nuanced, popular, and relatable characters in anime history&quot;. Anime and manga publications gave Shinji a mixed reception. Comic Book Resources&#x27; Angelo Delos Trinos wrote, &quot;No anime character inspires as many polarized takes as Shinji&quot;. Although his complexity was praised and generally considered realistic, his insecurity and weakness were criticized. Shinji&#x27;s characterization in the spin-offs and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, however, was positively received because of his more self-confident personality and the optimistic tone of his development.

===Asuka Langley Soryu===

 is a fiery pilot who is assigned to command Evangelion Unit 02 as the Second Child. She is a red-haired, blue-eyed, German-Japanese-American girl who was raised and educated in Germany. Asuka is a child prodigy who graduated from college at a young age; she is brave, positive, and enthusiastic about her role as a pilot, but has a pronounced inferiority complex towards males. Asuka appears to be authoritarian towards recent acquaintances. Although she has a natural spontaneity, she suffers from mental problems, which alongside her excessive self-love, causes her to be unable to pilot her Evangelion in the series&#x27; second half. Asuka is attracted to her colleague Shinji Ikari, but over time she starts to develop ambivalent feelings towards him. In the anime&#x27;s final episodes, Asuka develops a deep self-loathing and begins to feel anxiety at the idea of being alone, in a framework similar to separation anxiety disorder. In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; tetralogy, Asuka is renamed to Asuka Langley Shikinami and given the rank of Captain in the European Air Force.

Critics and official publications about the series have linked Asuka to psychological disorders and defense mechanisms such as masculine protest, reaction formation, repression, and narcissistic personality disorder. She maintained a high ranking in every popularity poll of the series and has appeared in surveys of the most-popular anime characters in Japan. Despite this, Asuka received mixed reception. Some critics took issue with her hubris and her personality, judging these as tiresome and arrogant; others appreciated her realism and complex psychological introspection.

===Rei Ayanami===


 is a pilot assigned to command Evangelion Unit 00 as the First Child. Her date of birth is unknown. Rei is a taciturn, shy girl who mechanically carries out orders from her superiors, even if they are cruel. She is committed to fighting against the Angels, as if it is the only connection between her and other people and her reason for living. Rei minimizes contact with others; the only exception being Gendo Ikari, to whom she is more open. Rei is a clone created from the genes of Yui Ikari, Gendo&#x27;s wife; every time Rei dies, she is replaced by a new clone, and she is aware of being replaceable. As the show progresses, Rei slowly befriends Shinji, her colleague at Nerv and classmate, discovering human emotions and acquiring greater self-awareness.

According to Winn-Lee, behind Rei&#x27;s cold and aloof appearance is a &quot;small spark of humanity&quot; that is overshadowed by her low self-esteem; Winn-Lee also said Rei &quot;knows she&#x27;s expendable, but the thing is, she&#x27;s still human&quot;. Critics have compared Rei to the Virgin Mary, Pinocchio, and a &quot;Great Bad Mother trying to take in her son&quot;. Anno originally conceived of Rei as a representation of his unconscious mind and a young, female schizophrenia sufferer. He asked Sadamoto to give Rei the likeness of &quot;a bitterly unhappy young girl with little sense of presence&quot;. Sadamoto also took inspiration from Paul Gallico&#x27;s novella &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;. Writer Patrick W. Galbraith described Rei as &quot;the single most popular and influential character in the history of otaku anime&quot;. Rei has received a positive reception, and has appeared in popularity polls about the best anime characters decades after the show&#x27;s first broadcast. Her role in &quot;Rebuild&quot; was especially appreciated; reviewers praised her development and gradual process of gaining self-awareness.

===Toji Suzuhara===

 is a student of class 2-A at the first municipal middle school in Tokyo-3. At first, he shows strong animosity towards Shinji, holding him responsible for an accident that affected his younger sister during the clash between the third Angel, Sachiel, and Unit 01; in the third episode, he assaults Shinji before the arrival of the fourth Angel, Shamshel. However, after witnessing the fight, Toji feels guilt for his actions and becomes concerned about Shinji, despite pride that prevents him from openly showing his feelings. Toji considers himself to be a tough guy and projects a strong character, but hides an honest, kind, and introverted side. His humane approach and expansive character have a positive influence on Ikari and the other Children. In the series&#x27; second half, Toji is chosen as the Fourth Child, the qualified subject and pilot assigned to command Eva-03. Toji accepts the task assigned to him on the condition his sister is transferred to the hospital at Nerv&#x27;s headquarters. However, during its activation experiment, the Angel Bardiel infects Unit 03, who goes out of control and clashes with and defeats 02 and 00; it then engages in a hand-to-hand fight with 01 that causes its destruction. Toji survives, but loses his left leg. In the manga adaptation, Toji is killed instead of being injured. In the &quot;Rebuild&quot; films, Asuka test pilots Unit-03 instead of Toji. As shown in the final installment, he marries Hikari and has a child with her.

===Kaworu Nagisa===

 is the Fifth Child, who is sent to Nerv as a replacement pilot for Unit 02 following Asuka&#x27;s psychological breakdown. Kaworu befriends Shinji Ikari, towards whom he has a sincere and unconditional affection, and then reveals himself as the seventeenth and final Angel Tabris. Kaworu infiltrates Nerv&#x27;s headquarters in an attempt to reunite with the first Angel Adam, but after discovering that the second Angel Lilith is locked in the Terminal Dogma, he asks Shinji to kill him. Kaworu was born on September 13, 2000, the same day as the Second Impact.

Critics have compared Kaworu to Jesus Christ for his sacrifice, &quot;Devilman&quot; Ryo Asuka, and Kaoru, a character from the science-fiction movie &quot;Summer Vacation 1999&quot; (1988). &quot;Evangelion Chronicle&quot; magazine linked his name to Tabris, the Angel of free will, and Cahor (Japanese: ), who is referred to as the Angel of deceit, a detail the publication relates to his deceptive, anthropomorphic features. Gainax originally conceived Kaworu as a cat that controls a boy, intended to appear in the series&#x27; twenty-second episode. Although Kaworu only appears in one episode, he remains popular with audiences and animation enthusiasts, and topped popularity polls. Anime News Network&#x27;s Kenneth Lee disliked Kaworu&#x27;s ambiguity and lack of clarity, and the homoerotic undertones of his relationship with Shinji; others reviewers praised it and enjoyed his personality. Kaworu&#x27;s role in the film &quot;Evangelion 3.0&quot; (2012) also drew positive comments from critics.

===Mari Illustrious Makinami===

 is introduced in the film &quot;&quot; (2009), the second installment of the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; tetralogy. Mari is originally from England and is a pilot for Nerv&#x27;s European branch. In her first appearance, Mari is assigned to Evangelion Unit 05 and fights aboard Asuka&#x27;s Eva-02. Mari was created at the request of Toshimichi Ōtsuki, the original series&#x27; producer, to introduce a new female character for the &quot;Rebuild&quot; series and attract new audiences. Anno decided not to meddle in the creation of Mari to avoid replicating the other main characters. He entrusted Mari&#x27;s development to Kazuya Tsurumaki, a member of Khara. Mari&#x27;s concept went through numerous revisions because neither Anno nor the other writers knew what kind of female hero they wanted to create, and were undecided until the deadline. Mari&#x27;s character design was entrusted to Sadamoto, who wanted to differentiate her from other &quot;Evangelion&quot; protagonists, and took inspiration from various sources, including &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, &quot;UFO,&quot; and a character played by Yui Aragaki in &quot;My Boss My Hero&quot; (2006).

Mari received mixed reception from critics. Some reviewers thought she was excessively sexualized, and considered her role irrelevant and insignificant; others praised it, finding her a good alternative to the other characters. In &quot;&quot;, Mari&#x27;s character was deepened with additional details, which drew attention and further mixed evaluations; several critics complained about the lack of explanations about her nature, finding her underdeveloped and wasted; others appreciated her battle scenes, her psychology, and her role in the show&#x27;s finale.

==Supporting characters==
===Nerv staff===
====Gendo Ikari====

 is Nerv&#x27;s supreme commander, husband of Yui Ikari, and father of Shinji, with whom he has a difficult relationship. Gendo conducts the Adam Project and the Human Instrumentality Project. He has cold, pragmatic, and calculating mannerisms, displaying a distant attitude toward his subordinates; only Fuyutsuki seems to understand his thoughts. Gendo&#x27;s attitude leads him to use any means necessary to achieve his personal goals, embarking on romantic and sexual relationships with Dr. Naoko Akagi and her daughter Ritsuko. Gendo leads the Instrumentality Project in hopes of reuniting with his wife Yui, who died in a mysterious accident years ago. Gendo is also the main antagonist of &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, and in particular &quot;&quot; (2021).

The character was originally conceived as a modern version of Victor Frankenstein; he was inspired by the personal experiences of the series&#x27; staff members, reflecting the absent and emotionally detached Japanese father figure. &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; director Hideaki Anno&#x27;s father was also an influence on Gendo; Anno also took inspiration from psychoanalysis concepts, especially the Freudian Oedipus complex. Gendo ranked in several polls about the most attractive male characters, but reviewers also had negative opinions of him; they criticized his abusive and manipulative ways. Gendo&#x27;s role in &quot;Rebuild&quot; has been more positively received, especially in the final installment. His image has also been described as &quot;one of the most easily recognizable images of anime on the internet&quot;; his joined-hands pose, which fans named the Gendo pose, has been parodied in subsequent anime and manga.

====Misato Katsuragi====

 is the captain of the Nerv Operations Department and Shinji&#x27;s guardian. Due to her childhood trauma, she has developed a frivolous, exuberant, and extroverted personality and leads a sloppy, messy lifestyle. Misato&#x27;s affectionate personality sometimes causes her to prioritize her human feelings over her duty as a Nerv employee, and her job provokes internal conflict and causes her to make difficult choices. In the &quot;Rebuild&quot; saga, Misato is the captain of Wille, an organization created to destroy Nerv.

For the character, the staff took inspiration from Fujiko Mine of &quot;Lupin III&quot;, Japanese writer Aya Sugimoto, and Usagi Tsukino of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, with whom she shares a voice actor. Mitsuishi described Misato as a lonely, insecure woman who tries to hide &quot;the darkness and loneliness she harbors deep in her heart&quot;. Writer Dennis Redmond speculated that Misato may be based on Nadia Arwol from &quot;The Secret of Blue Water&quot;, while Akio Nagatomi of The Animé Café compared her to Kazumi Amano from &quot;Gunbuster&quot;. Misato has ranked high in popularity polls and has generally had a positive reception. Reviewers appreciated her tenacity, endearment, and psychology; deeming her realistic and underrated.
====Kozo Fuyutsuki====
 is Nerv&#x27;s deputy commander. After obtaining a professorship as a teacher of metaphysical biology at Kyoto University, in 1999 he met Yui Ikari, a promising student at the same institute. Around this time, he met Yui&#x27;s boyfriend Gendo, of whom he was immediately suspicious. After the Second Impact, the United Nations called upon Kozo to conduct a formal investigation into the event. Kozo met Gendo again, reinforcing his suspicions about him. Kozo began to think that he and a mysterious organization named Seele may be responsible for the catastrophe and the deaths of billions of people. In 2003, Kozo continued to independently investigate the matter; having arrived at the Artificial Evolution Laboratory, he threatened to publicly disclose the truth he discovered, but Gendo led him to Central Dogma, where he met Dr. Naoko Akagi and learned of Gehirn, the association in which they both secretly operate. Gendo asked Kozo to collaborate with him to build the new history of mankind; for unknown reasons, Kozo accepted and later became Gendo&#x27;s close associate.

Although Kozo shares Nerv&#x27;s basic objectives, he occasionally shows he does not approve of its means. He has a balanced character and does not panic in dramatic situations. Despite his role as a deputy, he maintains an affectionate personality and a humane approach to his subordinates, including the pilots. In &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, a vision of Yui Ikari appears to Kozo during Instrumentality and he smiles to welcome her; he serenely watches the process while waiting to reunite with the woman he never stopped loving. Kozo&#x27;s last name Fuyutsuki comes from the of the same name. According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Gendo and Kozo are respectively based on Ed Straker and Alec Freeman from the television series &quot;UFO&quot;.

====Ritsuko Akagi====
 is the head of the first section of the technology department at Nerv&#x27;s headquarters, and one of the main developers of the Evangelion units. In 2005, during college, Ritsuko met and befriended Misato Katsuragi, as well as her boyfriend Kaji, whom Ritsuko considered annoying. In 2008, after completing her studies at Tokyo-2, Ritsuko joined Gehirn Research Center as the head of Project E. Following her transfer to the special agency Nerv, Ritsuko became responsible for the management of the Magi supercomputer. At Nerv, Ritsuko comes into close contact with her mother&#x27;s lover Gendo Ikari, learning secret information that is withheld from almost all other members of the organization.

Ritsuko is rational, and has a strong sense of discipline and detached judgment. She finds it difficult to reconcile these sides of her character, which are often a source of violent, emotional contrasts. Ritsuko shows great determination and indifference, and hesitates to talk about herself, even with longtime friends, which ultimately fractures her friendship with Misato by the end of the series. Despite her rational and reserved exterior, she is sensitive, expressive, and passionate. At the beginning of her university career, Ritsuko dyed her hair blonde to differentiate herself from her mother Naoko. She later fell in love with Gendo Ikari, with whom she entered a secret romantic relationship and offered him her scientific skills and body. Ritsuko is jealous of Rei, the center of Gendo&#x27;s attention, and feeling used and betrayed, she carries out reckless acts of revenge against him. In &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, Ritsuko is no longer able to manage her feelings of love and hate; she attempts to destroy Nerv&#x27;s headquarters, uttering the phrase &quot;Mom, do you want to die with me?&quot;. However, the Casper computer, in which Naoko&#x27;s personality is imprinted, refuses the command to self-destruct, and Gendo shoots Ritsuko dead. &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine compared Ritsuko to previous Anno characters, such as Kazumi Amano from &quot;Gunbuster&quot; and Electra from &quot;Nadia&quot;.

====Ryoji Kaji====
 is a member of Nerv&#x27;s Special Investigations Department. During college, he met Misato Katsuragi and Ritsuko Akagi. He later enters into a romantic relationship and cohabitation with Misato, which was broken off two years later. When Ryoji joined Nerv, he was transferred to Germany and appointed as Asuka&#x27;s guardian. In 2015, he traveled with Asuka to Japan and met his former university friends. During the trip, he secretly carried the embryo of Adam, the first Angel, and delivered it to Gendo Ikari. For Gendo, Ryoji sabotages the Jet Alone, a robot built by Nerv&#x27;s rival chemical industry community. Ryoji works at the Investigations Department of the Japanese Government Ministry of Internal Affairs and is also assigned by Seele to monitor Gendo Ikari. Ryoji is a spy under the pay of three organizations, which Gendo is aware of, but he seems to benefit the most from his presence.

Although the motive for Ryoji&#x27;s actions remains unknown, he tries to find the truth about Nerv&#x27;s real objectives. After the battle against the Angel Zeruel, one of Ryoji&#x27;s informants betrays him and a third man assassinates him. Ryoji bequeaths the results of his investigations to Misato. Some fan theories about the identity of his murderer arose; starting from the twentieth episode, many fans thought Misato, who takes a gun in the scene before his murder, is responsible, but the main staff falsified this theory, saying the responsible party would be found among the members of Seele or the secret services. To avoid misunderstanding, some scenes of the director&#x27;s cut version of the series were changed. The character was inspired by Captain Foster from the television series &quot;UFO&quot;.

====Makoto Hyuga====
 is one of Nerv&#x27;s main operators who, from the command bridge, follows and controls all operations of the Eva units. He assists Major Misato Katsuragi in the strategic planning of the battles against the Angels. Makoto has a friendly, kind, and compassionate nature but he speaks his mind and is not intimidated, even in front of his superiors. Compared to his colleagues, Makoto is more confident with Katsuragi, due to his skills and ability to gather secret information. On some occasions, Makoto acts rashly and seems to have feelings for Misato. Although Makoto is aware of his feelings, which are not reciprocated, he continues to assist Misato and launches into dangerous situations to help her. In &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, Misato appears to him during Instrumentality, and a mixed expression of terror and pleasure is visible on his face. His last name is derived from the Imperial Japanese Navy battleship of the same name. Hideaki Anno said he does not remember why he named the character Makoto, but says a possible influence may have been the novel &quot;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&quot; by Ryōtarō Shiba.

====Maya Ibuki====
 is one of the three main technical operators in the Operational Command Center at Nerv&#x27;s headquarters. Her main task is to report the synchronicity rate of the pilots. Being directly involved in Project E, Maya is subordinate to Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, for whom she feels a sense of veneration as she faithfully carries out her directives. Although she is a diligent and competent assistant, she is emotionally immature, and Ritsuko accuses her of excessive idealism. Maya&#x27;s scrupulous character makes her feel aversion to the Dummy System, which she considers to be inhuman. During bloody wartime confrontations, Maya feels revulsion or vomits. Over the course of the series, it is implied that Maya gradually develops feelings beyond professional respect for her senpai which turns into sapphic love. For the names Maya and Ibuki, Anno took inspiration from two cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy and a commander in the series &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot;.

====Shigeru Aoba====
 is, along with Makoto Hyuga and Maya Ibuki, one of the technical operators of the Operations Command Center at Nerv&#x27;s headquarters. Shigeru is realistic, serious, professional, and emotionally detached. He keeps his life and private life private and does not socialize much with his colleagues, although he has good relations with them. At work, Shigeru is calm and calculating. Shigeru is a big fan of music and plays guitar. In &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, during Instrumentality, Shigeru is terrified at the sight of Rei Ayanami&#x27;s clones. As his colleagues transform into LCL, an expression of terror is visible on his face, and Rei does not take on the appearance of any of his loved ones; according to the book &quot;The Essential Evangelion Chronicle&quot;, this is because he &quot;has never loved another person&quot;. His last name is derived from the Japanese Imperial Navy cruiser of the same name; the name Shigeru was chosen to create a pun with &quot;Aoba Shigereru&quot;, a 1974 Japanese film that was directed by Kihachi Okamoto.

===Classmates===
====Kensuke Aida====
 is a student in class 2-A of the first municipal middle school in Tokyo-3. Kensuke has strong dialectical skills, is a fan of military life, and often plays survivor games when he is alone in the countryside. Like his classmates Shinji Ikari, Toji Suzuhara, Rei Ayanami, and Hikari Horaki, Kensuke is motherless. Some dialogue in the seventeenth episode suggests that his father is part of the Nerv administration, either in its research department or general affairs division. Along with the rest of the school, he moves to another place after Tokyo-3 is destroyed.

====Hikari Horaki====

 is the head of class 2-A at Tokyo-3 Municipal Middle School. She has an older sister named Kodama and a younger sister named Nozomi. Hikari is grumpy, rigid, and rule-abiding but hides a sweet, patient side; she is caring and attentive to the needs of her sisters and friends. Hikari constantly taunts and reprimands her partner Toji Suzuhara, likely to repress her feelings of love towards him. Among the girls of 2-A, Hikari is the only one who can approach Asuka. In the series&#x27; final episodes, Hikari&#x27;s companion goes through an emotional breakdown and Hikari remains close to her, hosting Asuka in her house, and showing her sincere and unconditional affection until the end. For the character&#x27;s surname, Anno took inspiration from Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Ai to gensō no fascism&quot;; the names of her sisters, Kodama and Nozomi, are taken from high-speed trains of the Tokaido Shinkansen line.

===Other characters===
====Naoko Akagi====
 is the mother and colleague of Dr. Ritsuko Akagi. Naoko is a world-renowned scientist and a member of the Gehirn Research Center, and knows the truth about Second Impact and the Eva creation project. Naoko embarked on a secret relationship with Gendo, Gehirn&#x27;s commander-in-chief, while he was married to Yui. In 2008, Naoko completed the fundamental theory of the Magi System supercomputer, which was completed two years later. In the three Magi biocomputers she developed, she digitally transcribed the main aspects of her personality; as a woman, as a scientist, and as a mother. Naoko later realized that Gendo was exploiting her for her talent as a scientist and researcher. but ignored the truth and continued the relationship. In 2010, Gendo arrived at the base with a child named Rei Ayanami, who resembles Yui. On the evening of her visit, Rei gets lost in Gehirn&#x27;s control room and runs into Naoko, whom she calls an &quot;old hag&quot;, which Gendo also called her. Naoko recognizes Yui&#x27;s features in Rei&#x27;s face, and in a fit of rage, she strangles Rei and then commits suicide by crashing into the Caspar computer. For the character&#x27;s name, Hideaki Anno took inspiration from an old elementary-school company of his.

====Yui Ikari====
 is Shinji&#x27;s mother and Gendo&#x27;s wife. In 1999, when she was a student at Kyoto University, she met Professor Fuyutsuki and discussed research on artificial evolution with him. Later that year, she became romantically involved with Gendo, whom she married, to Fuyutsuki&#x27;s disappointment. Later, Yui works with her husband at the Laboratory for Artificial Evolution. In 2004, at the age of twenty-seven, Yui willingly proposed herself as a subject in an experimental activation of Unit 01. During the test, Yui was killed in front of Gendo, the other members of the laboratory, and her son Shinji. Yui was absorbed by the humanoid and her body disappeared. Attempts to recover her were unsuccessful, and the case was dismissed as an accident but became public knowledge. In the series&#x27; final episodes and in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, however, it is revealed that the accident was the result of Yui&#x27;s deliberate choice. Her soul is kept inside the unit, and she is occasionally able to aid Shinji by controlling its movements. In &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, Yui&#x27;s spirit gives Shinji the courage to choose his future and that of humanity, rejecting Instrumentality. Hideaki Anno chose the name Yui because it is similar to Rei&#x27;s name; while means &quot;zero&quot; or &quot;nothingness&quot;, can be translated as &quot;only one&quot;.

====Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu====
 is the mother of Asuka Langley Soryu. Kyoko was born in 1974 and worked for the German division of the Gehirn Research Center, which eventually became Nerv. In 2005, Kyoko was subjected to a contact experiment with Unit 02, which she had promoted the construction of. During the test, she suffered mental contamination and was psychologically damaged. After being hospitalized, Kyoko became unable to recognize Asuka and spoke to a cloth doll who she believed to be her daughter. In the meantime, Kyoko&#x27;s husband begins an affair with another scientist. Shortly afterward, Asuka is chosen as the Second Child and pilot of Unit 02; Asuka, believing the event could induce her mother to recognize her again, runs to Kyoko&#x27;s hospital room, only to find her body hanging from the ceiling. It is assumed that a part of Kyoko&#x27;s soul or her maternal side remains within Eva-02. For the names Zeppelin and Sōryū, staff took inspiration from two warships—one German and the other Japanese—while the name Kyōko was inspired by a character in a comic book by Shinji Wada.

====Keel Lorenz====
 is the president of the Human Instrumentality Committee and the secret organization Seele. Multiple cybernetic components are grafted into his body, allowing him to have vital energy despite his advanced age, being sixty-seven years old. Keel secretly manipulates the world&#x27;s fate to see the Third Impact realized. Keel is of German nationality and has a calm, rational personality. For the character&#x27;s name, the authors were inspired by biologist Konrad Lorenz; in the presentation document of the series, his name was Konrad.

====Pen Pen====

 is a small pet rockhopper penguin and the companion of Misato Katsuragi. Pen Pen, who belongs to a new breed of hot spring penguins, is most likely the result of a biotechnology experiment and has a serial number on his collar. He seems to have a high IQ, which allows him to bathe himself, understand human languages, read a newspaper, and live independently inside Misato&#x27;s apartment. In the series&#x27; final episodes, Pen Pen is moved to a country house to live with the Horaki family. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto designed the character to meet the staff&#x27;s request to include a being that could serve as the series mascot. Because the show is set in Hakone, a town known for its hot springs, Pen Pen was at first conceived as a monkey, but the idea was considered unattractive and was discarded. Pen-Pen is possibly inspired by , a genetically modified penguin that appears in a 1986 anime of the same name.

After initial hesitation, Tokita gives Misato Katsuragi the access code to activate the stop command. For the character&#x27;s name, Anno drew from Murakami&#x27;s &quot;Ai to gensō no fascism&quot;; the seventh episode also features men named Manda and Yasugi, whose names are borrowed from the same novel.

==Cultural impact==
===Popularity===
According to Allegra Frank and Aja Romano of &quot;Vox&quot;, in Japan, &quot;Evangelion&quot; &quot;spawned countless anime tropes&quot;, and &quot;it remains common to see characters like Shinji, Rei, and Asuka appear in advertisements or &quot;pachinko&quot; parlors throughout Japan, and the series&#x27; iconography remains widely recognizable in the country&quot;. According to Frakn, outside Japan &quot;&quot;Evangelion&quot; characters are well-known, beloved and memed by anime fans&quot;. The &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; characters were immediately popular with Japanese audiences, appearing at the top of popularity charts. According to the website Sora News 24, they enjoy &quot;eternal popularity&quot;, as evidenced by their frequent use for merchandise items. The series appeared for years in the Anime Grand Prix, a large, annual poll &quot;Animage&quot; magazine conducts. In 1996, Shinji and Gendo occupied the second and sixteenth place among the most-popular male characters; Rei, Asuka, and Misato were the first, third, and eighth, respectively, among the female ones. In 1997, the rankings saw Shinji (first), Kaworu (second), Kaji (tenth), Gendo (fourteenth), Toji (forty-fourth), and Fuyutsuki (fifty-seventh) among the male characters; and Rei (first), Asuka (fourth), Misato (eighth), Maya (nine-teenth), Ritsuko (twenty-seventh), and Hikari (forty-seventh) among the female characters. In 1998 Shinji and Kaworu maintained their placement, while Rei, Asuka, and Misato dropped to fifth, sixth, and twelfth, respectively. Some of the characters appeared in the magazine&#x27;s monthly rankings for years, such as Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Maya.

The protagonists also appeared in &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine&#x27;s polls, even years after the show&#x27;s first airing; from August to October 2009 they were among the most popular among the magazine&#x27;s readers, both in the male and female categories. In March 2010, &quot;Newtype&quot; named Rei the most-popular female character of the 1990s, and placed Shinji first and Kaworu second in the male category.

===Critical response===
The characters of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; divided critics. Peter Harcoff of the webzine The Anime Critic did not like Shinji&#x27;s weak personality and Asuka&#x27;s grumpiness but praised the relationships between the characters and their motivations. The website Anime Planet was critical of some aspects of the series but praised the characters. THEM Anime Reviews&#x27;s Raphael See found their characterization irritating and clichéd, saying he had seen similar personalities in previous anime. See&#x27;s colleague Tim Jones, disdained the psychology of the protagonists, all of whom have tragic pasts and relationship problems, with the exception of Kaji.

An implicit sex scene between two characters in the twentieth episode caused controversy considering the show was broadcast in an afternoon time-slot, and the last two episodes completely focus on the Shinji&#x27;s psychological depth and inner monologs, which raised further controversy and polarized the opinions of critics. For anthropologist Lawrence Eng, the ending does not give a sense of closure for most of the characters, and said, &quot;for many loyal fans of &quot;Evangelion&quot;, this was a betrayal on Anno&#x27;s part&quot;. Vice.com&#x27;s Ricardo Conteras, while not finding the conclusion incomprehensible, described it as incongruent with what the protagonists faced through the rest of the series. Anime director Yoshiyuki Tomino also criticized &quot;Evangelion&quot; and rebuked the show&#x27;s producers for not trying to &quot;making fun for or gaining the sympathy of the audience&quot;, and instead trying to show &quot;that everybody is sick&quot; and hopeless. According to Tomino, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a real work of art ... I think that we should try to show people how to live healthier, fuller lives, to foster their identity as a part of their community, and to encourage them to work happily until they die. I can&#x27;t accept any work that doesn&#x27;t say that&quot;.

Other reviewers praised the characterization of the protagonists. According to Kotaku&#x27;s Rita Jackson, &quot;it&#x27;s not fun to spend time with these characters&quot;, given the strong emotional pressure and anguish they are forced to suffer, and while &quot;sometimes characters feel more like mouthpieces for Anno&#x27;s thoughts about society than actual characters&quot;, she appreciated the writer&#x27;s &quot;brilliant&quot; work. Morgan Lewis of the webzine VG Culture HQ stated, &quot;none of the characters are black and white&quot; and &quot;all of them are screwed up beyond belief&quot;; he called Shinji the most layered character, stating &quot;Evangelion&quot; is not suitable for an inattentive audience. A similar opinion was given by Anime News Network&#x27;s Nick Creamer, according to whom one of the anime&#x27;s strengths is the fact no protagonist is trapped in a simple narrative role; Creamer said, &quot;&quot;Evangelion&quot; portrays the mindsets of its characters with empathy and nuance&quot;. According to Matthew Perez of &quot;Anime Reign&quot; magazine, &quot;the characters are by far the most hated aspect of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;&quot;; he noted many are initially archetypal and stereotypical. Perez praised the characters&#x27; realism and judged some of them to be the &quot;most well made in anime to date&quot;.

For writer Andrea Fontana, &quot;Evangelion&quot; would be &quot;a true sociological and psychological treatise&quot;; he praised the introspective insight of its protagonists and the underlying message of learning to be oneself. Equally positive were the reviews from Comic Book Resources authors. Ajay Aravind praised the personalities of Rei, Misato, and Yui; Anthony Gramuglia called the protagonists &quot;incredibly complicated and fascinating&quot;; and Reuben Baron appreciated the characters&#x27; three-dimensionality and exploration of trauma but criticized the fan service and sexualization of the teenage characters. Other writers at Comic Book Resource described the female characters as strong, determined, and independent, and considered the series to be ahead of its time. Anime News Network&#x27;s Martin Theron praised Sadamoto&#x27;s &quot;distinctive&quot; character design. Allen Divers, another editor at Anime News Network, stated, &quot;The characters and storyline of &quot;Evangelion&quot; would give Sigmund Freud complexes&quot;. Fellow reviewer Matt Jong also appreciated the development, calling it &quot;provoking&quot;; and Paul Fargo, another reviewer for the same website, praised the tragic nature and psychological depth of the second half of the series, especially in the director&#x27;s-cut version of the home video editions.

===Merchandise===
According to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Unofficial Guide&quot;, which was written by Kazuhisa Fujie and Martin Foster, the anime&#x27;s release &quot;ignited a boom in merchandise unprecedented in a country already awash with such goods&quot;, with over 600 items being made to celebrate the event. The characters were used for T-shirts, access-dateries, posters, and watches. Action figures became the most popular items, particularly those of Rei; books featuring her image on the cover also sold quickly and media named her &quot;the Premium Girl&quot;. When &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death &amp; Rebirth&quot; was released in 1997, the UCC Ueshima Coffee Co. company marketed coffee cans with the characters of the series, selling 400,000 cases—about twelve million cans; after the release of &quot;Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone&quot; in 2007, another 300,000 cases containing about nine million cans were sold. In 1997, a series of books dedicated to the show&#x27;s protagonists was published; Rei, Asuka, Shinji and Kaworu, along with two artbooks titled &quot;Photo File Eve&quot;, about only the female protagonists, and &quot;Photo File Adam&quot;, dedicated to the male characters. In the same year, a catalog titled &quot;E Mono&quot; containing articles about the series and the characters was published; it also listed some &quot;dōjinshi&quot;—unofficial comics made by fans.

According to critic Pier Francesco Cantelli, &quot;it is impossible to take a tour of Akihabara without coming across at least one poster depicting [the show&#x27;s] protagonists&quot;; he also compared the success of the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise to the popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in the United States. &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; protagonists also appear in video games based on the original animated series and media not belonging to the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise; these include &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;, &quot;Tales of Zestiria&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Keri hime sweets&quot;, &quot;Summons Board&quot;, &quot;Puyopuyo!!

===Legacy===

The protagonists of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; appeared on the covers of magazines specializing in anime and manga, such as &quot;Animage&quot; and &quot;Newtype&quot;, and the anime became the most-discussed product of the Japanese animation industry. Since the broadcast of the first episode at Comiket conventions, it appeared in the &quot;dōjin&quot; market, attracting male and female audiences in equal numbers. The Artifice&#x27;s Justin Wu attributed the characters&#x27; success to several factors, such as Sadamoto&#x27;s designs and the open-ended nature of the product, which is characterized by obscure points and facts that are left to viewers&#x27; interpretation and imagination; according to him, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; is a pivotal event in the history of merchandise, which became an important market. According to &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine, after the anime&#x27;s success, &quot;hordes of otaku fllooded Akihabra in search of the enigmatic Rei Ayanami, and companies realized for the first time that catering to the geek crowd could be very profitable ... Akihabara itself has transformed from an &#x27;electric town&#x27; famous for household appliances to the geek paradise it is today&quot;. Such a high trade in figures, trading cards, and similar products began the moe phenomenon, in which the audience&#x27;s attention is focused on empathy and attraction to the characters rather than the plot. According to scholar Patrick Galbraith, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; began a massive growth in anime that focused on cute girls, causing the fanzine and figure markets to grow tenfold due to viewers&#x27; emotional response to the characters, with &quot;[e]ntire fanzine conventions ... committed to the series and its characters&quot;.

Journal &quot;AsianScape&quot; described the representation of &quot;Evangelion&quot; characters as &quot;possibly the most innovative and influential aspect&quot; of the series, with the presentation of characters with deep, psychic traumas and alienation. Game Developer&#x27;s Brett Fujioka wrote, &quot;&quot;Eva&quot; turned hackneyed anime tropes and archetypes on their heads through its characters ... [Anno&#x27;s] psychologically malcontent characters resonated with Japanese youth at the time&quot;. Leading researchers also studied the characters&#x27; success. Japanese sociologist Shinji Miyadai, among others, reported instances of college students identifying with Shinji or Asuka; according to essayist Satomi Ishikawa, such episodes are a reflection of &quot;how influential the impact of this particular anime has been&quot; for Japanese youth at the time. Ishikawa noted in the years after the series aired, it became very popular, giving rise to the expression &quot;&quot;Eva&quot; phenomenon&quot;, and many fans saw themselves in the protagonists. The central element and the reason for so much attraction to &quot;Evangelion&quot; is in Japanese called , a theme that aroused empathy in the youth, who saw their problems in Shinji and Asuka. According to Ishikawa, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; became associated with the concept of &quot;adult children&quot; that was initially developed by U.S. psychologists and became the focus of Japanese media attention in the late 1990s.

As a result of the success of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, the &quot;sekaikei&quot; genre, in which plots combine apocalyptic crises with the sentimental comedy of school settings, spread and became popular; the love stories of the protagonists of such works are directly related to the fate of the world. Several representatives of this genre were inspired by Anno&#x27;s series they are mainly oriented on the psychology of the characters and their relationships rather than on the plot, becoming one of the main motifs of Japanese subculture. The neologism &quot;sekaikei&quot; was often replaced with the expression &quot;post-&quot;Evangelion&quot; syndrome&quot;. Critics have identified &quot;sekaikei&quot; elements in &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot;, &quot;She, the Ultimate Weapon&quot;, &quot;Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu&quot;, &quot;Your Name.&quot;, and &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;, interpreted as a parody of it. According to Comic Book Resources&#x27;s Timothy Donohoo, female heroes Rei and Asuka are &quot;extremely important to the development of modern anime writing ... All of &quot;Evangelion&quot; characters were influential and imitated, but in particular Rei and Asuka created a prototype for entertaining romantic interests that future series would use again and again&quot;. Patrick Drazen wrote, &quot;&quot;Evangelion&quot; exerted a very heavy influence in terms of character design on the anime that came after it&quot;. Rei is considered particularly popular and influential, and inspired several female heroes who came later and contributed to the spread of the &quot;kuudere&quot; stereotype, with apparently cold, apathetic, and mysterious characters. Asuka, Shinji, Misato and Gendo also inspired artists, characters in other animated series, video games, and comics. Asuka is considered an influential example of a &quot;tsundere&quot; protagonist; she is grumpy, short-tempered, and authoritarian but has a tragic past and deep motivations behind it.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Gene Park, a considerable portion of cyberculture is rooted in the success of &quot;Evangelion&quot;, which is popular on 4chan and other websites. According to Park, fans of the series are divided between Asuka and Rei, and have generated the &quot;waifu&quot; wars, a phenomenon in which users of blogs and websites clash to determine with different arguments which character is the most attractive. Maria R. Rider of Ex.org noted Gainax&#x27;s series has inspired &quot;Gasaraki&quot; character design, and particularly that of Miharu, who is similar to Rei. &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; author Nobuhiro Watsuki compared his character Yukishiro Tomoe to Rei; he also used Yui as the visual model for Honjō Kamatari&#x27;s face.

<doc id="284020" wikidata="Q1331128" url="?curid=284020" title="Angels (Neon Genesis Evangelion)">
<text>The are fictional entities from the anime television series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, which was produced by Gainax studio and directed by Hideaki Anno. The Angels also appear in the manga adaptation of the same name, which was illustrated by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.

In the original animated work, almost all of the Angels are antagonists of mankind who repeatedly try to reach the headquarters of the special agency Nerv in the city of Tokyo-3. Most of the Angels originate from an entity called Adam, but the eighteenth specimen, humanity, is descended from Lilith, the second Angel. To counter the Angels&#x27; invasion, Nerv builds the Evangelions, mechas that possess a force field called an AT Field, which the Angels also use to defend themselves.

The Angels appear in works from the animated series, in spin-off manga, video games, visual novels, in the &quot;yonkoma&quot; manga &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; film tetralogy. The names of the Angels past Adam and Lilith, which are revealed in the fourteenth and twenty-third episodes of the series, refer to the namesake angels of the Judeo-Christian tradition. The characteristics and functions of each Angel are deliberately similar to those of their namesakes in ancient sacred texts. Their designs have been praised by critics and animation enthusiasts, and influenced subsequent animated series.

==Conception==
During the making of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, the production staff decided to set the work on a battle between gods and humans. In one early draft, which was published about two years before airing, Gainax included enemies named , which they conceived as ancient relics scattered all over the globe and left in hibernation by a species called . These enemies were referred to as simple weapons with almost no biological component. According to Gualtiero Cannarsi, the editor who was in charge of the first Italian-language edition of the series, the Gainax studio members might have been inspired by James P. Hogan&#x27;s &quot;Giants&quot; series, Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and its film adaptation &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. The Apostolos would have been the servants and apostles of the giant Adam, the divine sentinel of a distant alien race formed long before humanity, drawing on Hogan&#x27;s evolutionary and science fiction themes. Anno also drew inspirations from classic carnivorous &quot;kaiju&quot; such as Gyaos from the &quot;Gamera&quot; franchise and Gaira from the 1966 film &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot;.

The original authors intended there to have been twenty-eight enemies, the first of which, Adam, would have been found in the Dead Sea region but destroyed in an explosion fifteen years before the events of the series. The initial scenario also included the introduction of two Apostolos named , which was described as the &quot;Angel of silence&quot; and , &quot;the rock of God&quot;. Writer Virginie Nebbia compared Turel design with the Emperor Neo mask from &quot;&quot;. The project was shelved during the production, but the ideas were recycled for the Angels Ramiel and Sahaquiel. The first episode would have featured a confrontation between Eva-01, piloted by Rei, and a &quot;metal Angel&quot; named Raziel which would have had anthropomorphic features similar to those of a giant. In the twenty-fourth episode, titled , there would be a great lunar battle against twelve Apostolos; humans would realize their helplessness in the face of their enemies&#x27; overwhelming superiority and &quot;the promised time&quot; would approach. For their number, the authors took inspiration from the twelve apostles of the Lamb that are mentioned in the book of Revelation, but the idea of multiple clashes on the Moon was abandoned, eventually being recycled for the battle against the nine Mass Production Model Evangelions in the 1997 theatrical conclusion.

Another scenario planned two ancient prehistoric civilizations equipped with advanced technology appearing on Earth before the appearance of humanity. The first of the two, known as the &quot;First Ancestral Race&quot;, would create artificial humanoids Evangelion, which would then rebel against their creators causing their extinction. A &quot;Second Ancestral Race&quot; would then create the Spear of Longinus in an attempt to defeat them, scattering the dormant Angels around the globe in case anyone tried to reactivate the humanoids. Moreover, in a draft of the twenty-first episode of the series, Misato would mention the origin of the enemies, saying; &quot;I know the Angels aren&#x27;t just battle weapons left by the First Ancestral Race&quot;. According to Nebbia, staff took inspiration both from &quot;Nadia&quot; and &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; for the scenario, in which ancient civilizations are destroyed by their own creations, while for the opposition between Adam and Lilith Gainax possibly took clue from the works of artist Daijiro Morohoshi. Nebbia also compared Angel red core with Ultraman&#x27;s Color Timer, and the AT Field to the Ideon&#x27;s barrier from &quot;Space Runaway Ideon&quot;.

In the final version of the show, the Angels were renamed and indicated in the characters&#x27; dialogue with the word , after Jesus twelve disciples, rather than the term , with which the angels of the Christian tradition are usually indicated. Within the series&#x27; narrative, Gainax chose to use the English translation for Angel, &quot;messenger&quot;, which is written in Latin characters and is readable in graphemes and written in overlays, as in the case of Nerv&#x27;s computers. Michael House, the only American member of Gainax, protested about the juxtaposition of the two terms, but Hideaki Anno decided to keep the dual naming of the enemies.

In one early draft of the series, the Nerv&#x27;s supercomputer, the Magi System, would assign a name to each Angel. The director gave general guidelines for the design of each Angel. Their shapes became reflections of the feelings of Anno&#x27;s generation, reflecting the climate of Japan in the 1990s. During the broadcast of the series, the Japanese economy and society were perceived in the country as inherently corrupt and decadent, with no one being able to trace the causes, making the concept of &quot;enemy&quot; ambiguous. The enemy of twentieth-century Japan, according to Anno, was neither political nor defined, as in the case of the religious sect Aum Shinrikyō, which in March 1995 attacked the Tokyo subway with sarin gas. The Angels and the character Gendo Ikari were represented as amorphous beings, since for the director the concept of &quot;enemy&quot; is per sé undefined.

Mahiro Maeda drew Gaghiel and Israfel, while Yoshitō Asari designed Sachiel, Shamshel, and Zeruel. The artists avoided giving them anthropomorphic designs, which would have been more challenging during production. In the first two episodes, in which Sachiel appears, the staff had enough resources to hire animators, but for the fifth and sixth they already changed course.

==Characteristics==
Angels are organic beings whose atomic structure has both particle and wave nature, and therefore characterized by the wave-particle duality of light. At the beginning of the series, their objectives and identity are unknown. but they are all attracted by an Angel – called Lilith – that is locked in the deepest section of the Nerv&#x27;s headquarters, the Terminal Dogma. Academic Thouny described them as &quot;polymorphous figures of destruction that mark irruption of the world into the everyday, the opening of the social structure to alterity and death&quot;. The Angels&#x27; genetic makeup has a 99.89% affinity with that of humans. They can change shape from vaguely anthropomorphic to that of a geometric solid, and equally variable sizes. Many are equipped with a red sphere known as the &quot;core&quot; or &quot;sphere of light&quot;, which is also their main source of energy and weakness. The &quot;fruit of life&quot;, an organ of unknown nature, is responsible for their regenerative abilities. Humanity, the last example of an Angel, has the &quot;fruit of knowledge&quot; instead.

Angels have the universal ability to generate a force field called the Absolute Terror Field, or simply AT Field, which is similar to that of Evangelion units and makes them nearly indestructible. Their names and attacks have been prophesied in the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient documents in the possession of a secret organization called Seele. The reason they appear in Tokyo-3 one at a time, never attacking collectively, is unknown. In the opening sequence of the seventeenth episode, &quot;Fourth Child&quot;, Nerv director Gendō Ikari says the Angels &quot;are beginning to attain intelligence&quot;. According to academic Satoshi Tsukamoto, the sentence means that the Angels &quot;are attempting to acquire abilities to compete against human beings and control them&quot;. Writer Kitamura similarly stated that the Angels gradually make progress in communicating with the Evas they fight and send message to Shinji during the series. According to a guide on the series contained in a manual for the card game , there is a connection between the Angels; each Angel seems to be an evolutionary outgrowth of the previous one, and the fact they attack one at a time suggests they are aware of the status of each of the other specimens and react accordingly.

==In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;==
===Adam===
 is the progenitor of most of the Angels. It is represented as a giant of light with features similar to those of an Evangelion. A research team named the Katsuragi expedition, led by Misato Katsuragi&#x27;s father, finds Adam in Antarctica and begins to examine its energy source, the S2 engine. The scientists of the expedition accidentally awaken Adam as a result of a contact experiment, causing a planetary catastrophe known as the Second Impact to occur. Half of the human population dies, and Adam is reduced to an embryonic state. Behind the event is the secret organization Seele, which is devoted to the search for the &quot;path to Adam Kadmon&quot;. Agent Ryoji Kaji transports Adam to the Nerv headquarters, handing it over to the commander of the agency, Gendo Ikari. Adam&#x27;s soul is incorporated in the seventeenth Angel Tabris, while its embryo is implanted into Gendo&#x27;s body. Adam is cloned and used as basis to build the Evangelions, with the only exception of Eva Unit 01, created from Lilith.

Its name comes from the Biblical Adam. In the Book of Genesis, God creates Eve, the first woman, from Adam. In the twenty-first episode of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, it is revealed the Evas were similarly created from Adam. In the Jewish Kabbalah, Adam is described as a kind of deity, a being that is capable of giving life and as an entity to which all things are destined to return at the end of time. According to writers Kazuhisa Fujie and Martin Foster, in the series Kaworu Nagisa states &quot;those who come from Adam must return to Adam&quot; referring to this tradition. Writer Virginie Nebbia compared Adam&#x27;s arrival on the White Moon to that of Bemular, Ultraman&#x27;s very first enemy, on a blue sphere. According to Nebbia, Adam&#x27;s luminescent appearance during the Second Impact also recalls that of the giant of light from &quot;Ultraman 80&quot;.

Critic Marc MacWilliams noted &quot;Evangelion&quot; Adam is portrayed as a giant being of light &quot;as portrayed again in Kabbalistic texts before his Fall&quot;. Academic Fabio Bartoli likened Adam&#x27;s role to the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon; in Hermetic terminology, Adam Kadmon refers to humanity in a state of mental and spiritual perfection. He is also described in Kabballah as an androgynous being. In the twenty-fourth episode of the series, Kaworu Nagisa describes Adam as the &quot;mother&quot; of all Angels. Carl Gustav Horn similarly noted; &quot;the Kabbalistic view is that all other creatures without exception – even the angels and archangels – are based on Adam (Kadamon) but were left incomplete: only Adam (of Genesis) was a complete image of the Divine&quot;. A being named Adam was also introduced by Gainax in the series &quot;Nadia&quot;.

===Lilith===
 is the second Angel. It is kept in the Terminal Dogma, the deepest section of the Nerv headquarters. Lilith&#x27;s face is covered with a mask on which are drawn the seven eyes of a symbol called the Seele emblem. Lilith has the appearance of an anthropomorphic giant whose hands are nailed to a cross. Instead of lower limbs, it has small, humanoid legs. Lilith is pierced on the cross by a weapon called Spear of Longinus. The soul of the Angel is kept inside Rei Ayanami. In the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; (1997), the Angel&#x27;s body unites with Rei, takes on the form of a giant Ayanami, and grows to the size of the Earth, developing a giant anti-AT Field and starting the Third Impact, an event in which the souls of all human beings merge into one being. Writer Gerald Miller noted that just as the intercourse between Adam and Eve was the genesis of humankind&#x27;s lineage in the Judeo-Christian story, so does the union of Adam and Lilith lead to &quot;a new genesis for humankind&quot;.

Lilith, according to the video game &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion 2&quot;, arrived by chance on Earth in a celestial object called Black Moon, also called Lilith&#x27;s Egg, which along with a White Moon of Adam was sent by an alien &quot;First Ancestral Race&quot;. According to the video game Classified Informations, the First Ancestral Race, billions of years before the series, sent seven Moons into the universe with seven beings called the Seeds of Life, including Adam and Lilith, seven objects to contain them named Spears of Longinus and instruction manuals named Dead Sea Scrolls. The First Race did not plan for two Seeds to co-exist on the same planet; so the progenies of Adam and Lilith clash for survival. The Angels are thus the legitimate successors of Adam and the original inhabitants of Earth. Lilith&#x27;s arrival caused the First Impact, the destruction of its Lance and the formation of the Moon. The video game also says; &quot;Some [Angels] were trying to access Lilith and reset all life, some of them had nothing in mind, and some were trying to recover their progenitor Adam&quot;.

Its name comes from Lilith, Adam&#x27;s first wife. According to Jewish legends, demons called Lilim were born from their union. The Angel Lilith&#x27;s design was elaborated upon by Mitsuo Iso. According to character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the original scenario did not include Lilith, which was introduced following the airing of the series and some staff research on Christianity because &quot;not touching Lilith seemed to hurt Anno&#x27;s pride&quot;. Writer Virginie Nebbia compared Lilith&#x27;s arrival on Black Moon to Ultraman&#x27;s arrival on a red sphere in the series of the same name. In the episode &quot;Rei II&quot;, the image of two giants without the lower part of their bodies and merged to each other is visible; according to Gainax, it represents Lilith and Eva-01 around the period of Yui Ikari&#x27;s disappearance.

In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; tetralogy, Lilith is present from the beginning. Misato shows Lilith to Shinji before the battle against Ramiel. In the saga, Lilith&#x27;s aspect has been modified by animator Okama and Hideaki Anno: in &quot;Evangelion 1.0&quot; (2007) Lilith has scars on its chest, the result of scientific experiments; its mask is similar to that of the Angel Sachiel. Lilith, along with Rei and Eva-01, has been compared to the Jungian archetype of the Great Mother, the feminine authority that represents protection, fertility, darkness and inescapable abyss. Its role can also be likened to the astrological concept of the Black Moon, which is also named Lilith.

===Sachiel===
, the third Angel, has an anthromophorpic appearance. On the upper part of its trunk, it has a disk that is similar to a face, while on the outer sides of the legs it has two gills. Once on land, the armed forces of the United Nations attack Sachiel, which can survive the UN&#x27;s most powerful weapon, the N2 mine. The attack damages Sachiel&#x27;s face and temporarily stop its advance. Sachiel then regenerates and replaces its face with a second face. After the crash, Sachiel learns how fighter aircraft work and can replicate their effectiveness, developing the ability to launch explosive light beams. It can also use a pair of &quot;protractile spears&quot; or &quot;spears of light&quot; incorporated into the forearms. In the second episode, &quot;The Beast&quot;, Sachiel fights with Eva-01, which goes into a berserk mode and manages to defeat the Angel. Eva-01 neutralize Sachiel&#x27;s AT Field, and Sachiel commits suicide self-exploding.

Its name comes from Sachiel, the angel of water. Sachiel is considered a cherubim who protects the tree of life with spears of fire according to the Old Testament, a detail that possibly inspired the fictional Angel&#x27;s protractible spears. Academics Sellés de Lucas and Hernández-Pérez linked its second face to the Book of Ezekiel, where cherubims are described as having four heads. The authors initially intended the Angel to fight at sea against Unit 02 in the eighth episode &quot;Asuka Strikes!&quot;, but this idea was set aside and used for Gaghiel. Writer Dennis Redmond described it as a &quot;strangely abstract, gilled creature&quot; and a &quot;neo-Expressionistic Godzilla&quot;. Sachiel is based on Ishtar, an android that appears in the manga &quot;Wahhaman&quot; by Yoshitō Asari; its back is inspired by that of a cat. Writer Virginie Nebbia also compared its design to Jamila from &quot;Ultraman&quot; and King Bockle from &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot;. At the storyboard stage, Sachiel&#x27;s figure had different connotations and its fight was similar to the &quot;Ultraman&quot; battles. In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, Sachiel is known as the fourth Angel. The animators superimposed images of a light reflecting on an expanse of water and one of the Milky Way on its luminescent core.

===Shamshel===
, the fourth Angel, has an insect-like appearance and its form fuses that of a mollusk and that of a cetacean. Although it has limbs, Shamshel slowly flies at low altitude, to avoid detection by Nerv radar equipment. Shamshel uses two weapons that are similar to luminescent whips and have high cutting capabilities, being able to pierce the abdomen of Eva-01 in battle. Shamshel is shot down by the Unit 01, which pierces it with a weapon called Prog-Knife. According to Ritsuko Akagi, the DNA map of the Angel corresponds with 99.89% of that of human DNA.

Its named after Shamsiel, who is believed to be the angel of the day. The name, according to official sources, is an allusion to its fight with Unit 01, which takes place in daylight and ends just before sunset. Its appearance is similar to that of an Alien Bira from &quot;Ultraseven&quot;, and is inspired by that of a creature called &quot;the three-meter extraterrestrial&quot;, whose garage kit was made by a Gainax-associated company called General Products. Its battle took inspration from the &quot;Ultraman&quot; battles by director Akio Jissoji. In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, Shamshel is known as the fifth Angel. Shamsiel&#x27;s torso opens into a set of articulating ribs that claw the air like crab legs.

===Ramiel===

 is the fifth Angel. Its body is a regular octahedron. A wide drill, which pierces the strong armor of the underground Nerv headquarters, extends from the lower body. Ramiel is equipped with a strong AT Field and an accelerated-particle cannon, which, exploiting the collision of subatomic particles, emits a powerful beam of photons due to an inner torus reactor. Ramiel&#x27;s core, unlike those of previous Angels, is located inside its body, overcoming the biggest weakness of its predecessors and revealing the existence of a direct link between the Angels. In the fifth episode, &quot;Rei I&quot;, Ramiel strikes Eva-01 with its light beam before its exit to the surface. To face the threat, in the episode &quot;Rei II&quot; Misato Katsuragi conceives a strategy called Operation Yashima to destroy Ramiel, involving both Eva-01 and Eva-00. The fight concludes once Eva-01 hits Ramiel with a positron cannon, permanently destroying it.

As a source of inspiration for Ramiel, the authors took the monster from &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot;. Anime News Network&#x27;s Lynzee Loveridge described Ramiel&#x27;s design as &quot;Anno&#x27;s shout out to &quot;Future Police Urashiman&quot;&quot;, while Yasutaka Yoshimura compared it with some abstract shapes in the final scenes of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. It is named after Ramiel, the angel of thunder, in reference to its particle cannon. Initially, in correspondence of each face of the octahedron Ramiel would have had a solid, floating, triangular shape and its beam of light would have used positrons. In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, Ramiel is known as the sixth Angel and possesses the ability to transform its regular octahedron form into a variety of solids. For its &quot;Rebuild&quot; design, the staff took inspiration from the depiction of the microorganism Andromeda in Robert Wise&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and an image that Takashi Watabe drew twenty years earlier which depicts a four-dimensional body moving in a three-dimensional world.

===Gaghiel===
, the sixth Angel, appears in &quot;Asuka Strikes!&quot; in the Pacific Ocean and goes to attack the UN fleet, which is transporting Eva-02 and secretly the embryonic form of Adam. Gaghiel resembles an aquatic creature; its body has fin-like appendages and a hydrodynamic shape, allowing it to quickly move through water. The upper body has a face identical to the faces of Sachiel. The Angel attacks the naval fleet using the bulk of its body, sinking ships. When approaching its targets, it opens its mouth and squeezes its enemies in its jaws. Gaghiel&#x27;s core, unlike those of previous Angels, is located inside the mouth.

During the fight, Gaghiel jumps onto the aircraft carrier &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and moves to attack Eva-02, leading the Angel and Eva to crash into the sea in the Itō area. Its body is long. Eva-02 neutralizes the Angel&#x27;s AT Field and opens its mouth to allow two armored warships, which were evacuated and sunk with the Kingston valves, to penetrate its jaws and fire on the Angel&#x27;s core. The operation is successful and Gaghiel is defeated by Asuka Langley Soryu and Shinji Ikari. The behavior of the Angel, which appeared at sea away from Tokyo-3, is attributable to the presence of the first Angel Adam on the ships of the fleet.

The name Gaghiel (Hebrew: ), also called Gagiel, Daghiel or Dagiel, in Judeo-Christian folklore is the angel of the fish. Its Hebrew name can be translated as &quot;roaring beast of God&quot;, and has been interpreted by writer Will Raus as a possible allusion to its appearance, which is similar to that of a beast fighting in the water.

===Israfel===
 is the seventh Angel. Asuka Langley Soryu, aboard her Eva-02, strikes it with its Sonic Glaive splitting it in half. After the attack, the Angel regenerates into two parts, both of which able to fight individually. Israfel attacks and defeats the two mechas, which return to their base to await a second confrontation. Following their first defeat, the UN armed forces attack Israfel, the two parts of which they nickname Kō and Otsu. Thanks to the use of N² weapons, the UN can temporarily stop its advance. The only way to defeat Israfel, according to Misato, is &quot;a double coordinated attack on its core&quot;; between the two parts of the divided Angel is a bond that allows Kō and Otsu to share their behaviors and vulnerability. After a regeneration process, the Angel merges, regains its original form, and again begins its advance. In the second clash with the units, Israfel imitates the weapons used against it in the first battle, launching rays with high destructive potential against the Eva and using its upper limbs as blades. During the fight, Eva-01 and Eva-02, moving in synchronization, attack the Angel. Israfel splits again, and the two units jump into the sky, launching a synchronized kick that destroys its cores.

The seventh Angel is named after the messenger of music and resurrection, Israfil (Arabic: إسرافيل), a detail related to the musical attack of Eva-01 and 02. According to Will Raus, Israfel&#x27;s role of resurrection could allude to the Angel&#x27;s ability to split. The terms Kō and Otsu come from the series of Heavenly Stems. Writer Virginie Nebbia compared Israfel with Pestar from &quot;Ultraman&quot;. Its capacity of fission and brithness have been compared with those of a single-cell organism and mercury.

===Sandalphon===
, the eighth Angel, is detected inside the volcanic crater of Mount Asama in a human-embryo-like state and enclosed in a chrysalis. The Nerv decides to attempt to capture it, but the being awakens during the attempt and quickly mutates. Gualtiero Cannarsi, editor of the first Italian adaptation of the series, compared its adult form with the Limanda fish. Sandalphon collides with Eva-02, demonstrating high levels of physical endurance. Its core is concealed within its body and is not visible to observers. During the fight, Asuka and other Nerv members using the concept of thermal expansion to develop a plan to defeat it. Eva-02, using a coolant in its equipment, causes Sandalphon to undergo thermal constriction, resulting in damage to its body structure.

The fictional Angel&#x27;s name alludes to Sandalphon, the angel of embryos. During its metamorphosis into its adult form, the producers included a plaintive background voice using the electronically distorted howls of an infant. The Angel&#x27;s design took inspiration from prehistoric creatures such as the trilobite and the &quot;Anomalocaris&quot;. The idea of an enemy-capture attempt was planned for the eleventh episode, but moved to the tenth during the production. According to a guide on the original series included with the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion RPG&quot; card game, the Sandalphon episode suggests that dormant, larval Angels are hidden around the world. An official encyclopedia on the series links its appearance with the biblical Book of Enoch, in which the word &quot;Heaven&quot;, the abode of angels, actually refers to an Earthly location; because Sandalphon is discovered in the magma chamber of a volcano, &quot;Evangelion&quot; Angels similarly exist &quot;in the same world as ours&quot;. According to writer Virginie Nebbia, for Sandalphon&#x27;s battle staff took inspiration from the novel&quot; Sundiver&quot;.

===Matarael===
The ninth Angel, , resembles an arthropod arachnid chelicerate. Unlike arthropods, it has a single central body, from the top of which extends four oversized legs, making it akin to the opilionid subclass. The main body is similar to a geometric solid obtained from the section of ellipsoid, reminiscent of an upside-down turtle. Nine human-eye-like drawings are evident on its main body. The eyes are arranged in an equilateral triangle, and one of them is placed at the center of the body&#x27;s lower section; from the central eye it pours a corrosive liquid on its enemies. The acid is likely produced by an exocrine gland inside the Angel. Once ashore, Matarael invades Tokyo-3 and decides to penetrate Nerv by corroding an armored portcullis leading to the organization&#x27;s headquarters. The Angel pours its acid into the wells dug in the sixth episode of the series by the Angel Ramiel, and its strategy suggests it is mindful of its predecessor&#x27;s actions. It clashes with Eva 00, 01 and 02, which defeat it with gunfire.

The name Matarael (Hebrew:) comes from the Book of Enoch, which describes it as the angel of rain. The name of &quot;Evangelion&quot; Matarael refers to its offensive strategy and its powerful, corrosive acid, which it rains on its enemies.

===Sahaquiel===
, the tenth Angel, appears in Earth&#x27;s orbit above the Indian Ocean using its body as a bomb. Its symmetrical body shape is similar to that of some single-celled organisms such as amoebas. On its body are three geometric figures that resemble the human eye, with a big central eye in which the core is located. Before attacking the Nerv headquarters, Sahaquiel detaches some small portions of its main mass that are equipped with an AT Field, and hurls them to the ground to correct its trajectory. Gualtiero Cannarsi compared its ability to divide with the budding of protozoa and mesozoa. It can materially interfere with Nerv&#x27;s military equipment, destroying a research satellite and jamming enemy ground communications. Its destruction requires the collaboration of all the three Evas owned by Nerv. Once it arrives at Tokyo-3, Sahaquiel is jammed by Unit 01, while its AT Field is breached by Unit 00. Eva-02 destroys its core, defeating it.

For Sahaquiel staff took inspiration from the angel of the same name, the angel of the sky and guardian of the fourth heaven of Paradise, which is referenced in the fictional Angel&#x27;s aerial attack strategy. The connection with the biblical Sahaquiel&#x27;s guardian function is realized in its elongated shape, which resembles that of a deformed eye. The name Sahaquiel (Hebrew: ) is translatable as &quot;Ingenuity of God&quot;, which Will Rauss interpreted as a possible allusion to the Angel&#x27;s uses of its AT Field. Its design was inspired by surrealist art. In the initial draft, Sahaquiel had a sharp, string-shaped body similar to Armisael&#x27;s. Sadamoto drew the Angel to show &quot;Evangelion&quot; enemies may not always be anthropomorphic, like Seele.

In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, Sahaquiel is known as the eighth Angel. Its design by Mahiro Maeda has several changes; in the movie &quot;Evangelion 2.0&quot;, its AT Field is powerful enough to distort the path of light and its body, which was initially spherical, unravels and changes shape, revealing silhouettes of humans on its surface. At the bottom of its main body, Sahaquiel develops an anthropomorphic entity that pierces Unit 01&#x27;s hands with spear-like weapons, which were designed by director Takeshi Honda. Masayuki suggested having Sahaquiel die in a wave of blood that floods Tokyo-3, which was inspired by the &quot;tokusatsu&quot; tradition and the scene in which Sapporo collapses in &quot;Japan Sinks&quot; (1974).

===Iruel===
 is the eleventh Angel, which first manifests itself as corrosive stains on a wall of the Nerv headquarters. At this early stage, Iruel behaves as an obligate anaerobic bacterium. Nerv attempts but fails to eradicate Iruel by increasing the presence of ozone in the air, but Iruel starts a fast evolution process which allows it to resist to ozone. Iruel is a biological microprocessor and a colony of microscopic nanomachines-sized individuals rather than a single Angel. These singularities, similar to bacteria, are united in an agglomeration that quickly evolves radically to take on the form of a computer. Iruel hacks and seeks the access code to the three Magi supercomputers, the most important part of the structure, to activate a program of self-destruction at the headquarters. Dr. Ritsuko Akagi devises a &quot;reverse hacking&quot; strategic plan, believing it is better to increase the enemy&#x27;s evolution and insert a program to make Iruel choose to coexist with the Magi System. Ritsuko&#x27;s program defeats Iruel, saving Nerv&#x27;s headquarters.

Mitsuo Iso suggested a battle against an invisible enemy and the basic plot. In religious texts, Iruel is referred to as the angel of fear. Writer Will Raus interpreted the sense of dread felt by Nerv members during its attack as a reference to the biblical angel. &quot;Evangelion Chronicle&quot; encyclopedia likened the Angel&#x27;s program of self-extinction with cellular apoptosis, while coexistence with the Magi System as a form of symbiosis. Iruel&#x27;s properties, such as self-replication, are similar to those of a universal molecular assembler.

===Leliel===
 appears as a black-and-white-streaked floating sphere and a black shadow. The spherical body is its true shadow, while the apparent shadow on the ground is the main body. The Angel is wide and thick. It extends its AT Field in the vicinity of its enemy, a process that coincides with the manifestation of the apparent shadow, which is capable of engulfing the matter it encounters. This physicality is maintained using an inverted AT Field, within which extends a dimension called &quot;number-imaginary space&quot;, a parallel dimension known as the &quot;Dirac Sea&quot;. During the fight, this dark shadow extends to the feet of Eva-01 and begins to engulf it. It is not made clear whether Leliel&#x27;s goal is the absorption of the humanoid or direct contact with its pilot, Shinji Ikari. Dr. Ritsuko Akagi devises a strategy to destroy Leliel and recover Unit 01 using all existing N2 bombs. During the countdown to ordnance release, the spherical body breaks and Unit 01 emerges, causing an anomaly in the imaginary number circuit and shooting down the enemy.

To explain the Angel&#x27;s nature and its Dirac sea, Ritsuko said its body is made up of strings. Leliel is the angel of the night and is called the &quot;prince of conception&quot;. The fictional Angel&#x27;s shadow and the outflow of Unit 01, which resembles childbirth and gives it the characteristics of a womb, allude to the biblical angel. Geometric figures similar to female genitalia are also visible in its pattern. Its name means &quot;jaw of God&quot;, which Will Raus interpreted as a reference to the fictional Angel&#x27;s ability to consume any object. Its design is inspired by Surrealism and optical art. Japanese architect Yasutaka Yoshimura compared Leliel&#x27;s design with Bridget Riley&#x27;s work &quot;Fragment 5&quot;. Writer Virginie Nebbia compared it with Dada from &quot;Ultraman&quot;, while academic Dennis Redmond noted that &quot;Neuromancer&quot; makes use of moiré patterns in a scene in which Case tries to break free from a neural trap set by one of the AIs of the story. 

While trapped inside the Angel, Shinji encounters and converses with another self, which is presumed to be Leliel. The scene, which is set on a train, was the idea of Kazuya Tsurumaki, who took inspiration from a dream he had as a child. The staff decided to include an episode with an Angel that is interested in humans to avoid revealing the riddles about the Angels&#x27; true nature. For the clash, Gainax condensed the ideas of what would have been a trilogy of episodes with the same theme. In the initial scenario, Leliel would select Japanese from the verses of some animals and several human languages so it could communicate with Shinji. Tsurumaki and the production staff changed their minds, finding the idea of an Angel conversing in human language &quot;too anti-climactic&quot; and &quot;pulp fiction&quot;. According to the official film books of the series, the two Shinji in the sequence represent the psychological concepts of ego and superego. The Dirac Sea depicted in the anime took inspiration from Paul Dirac&#x27;s concept of the same name and is also drawn from the novel by Ryu Mitsuse.

===Bardiel===
 has a nature similar to that of a fungus or a parasitic bacterium, which allows it to infiltrate the body of Eva-03 during its transport by air from the United States of America to Japan. After the contamination, a crack opens on the unit&#x27;s back, inside which molten filaments similar to hyphae are visible. During its advance towards Tokyo-3, Bardiel fights against Eva-02 and Eva-00, making a white, irritant liquid drip inside the unit&#x27;s body. Bardiel&#x27;s attack mode does not belong to a single being, but to a colony of microscopic Angels. The Angel is defeated by Shinji Ikari&#x27;s Eva-01, which is activated by a new piloting system named the Dummy System, which destroys the infected Evangelion.

The fictional Angel&#x27;s contamination of Unit 03 during its passage through a blanket of storm clouds is an allusion to its namesake Bardiel, the angel of hail and lightning. Writer Dennis Redmond interpreted the scream of the infected Eva-03 as a reference to Godzilla. Redmond also noted that Bardiel is framed against a setting sun reminiscent of the Japanese flag in the episode. According to him, this is &quot;a dead ringer for John Woo&#x27;s Hong Kong thrillers, and the conclusion will subtly quote Woo&#x27;s trademark theme of warring brothers or battling doubles&quot;. Most of the scenes where Bardiel appears were produced by Production I.G, who also contributed to the animation of the fight against Iruel. Writer Virginie Nebbia compared Bardiel&#x27;s role to Imit Ultraman from the &quot;Ultraman&quot; series, fake Ultramans controlled by Alien Zarab. In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, Bardiel is known as the ninth Angel.

===Zeruel===
, the fourteenth Angel, is almost anthropomorphic. On its back are signs of a pair of wings, which in classical and popular iconography are the symbol of angelic creatures. In combat, Zeruel shows great physical strength, easily surpassing the line defences of Nerv and destroying 18 armor plates of the Nerv headquarters by a single attack. It is also able to evade detection by radar equipment, allowing it to penetrate the headquarters of the organization unimpeded. It emits explosive beams of light from its eyes, and can use its thin upper limbs by means of a blade-and-bellows-like mechanism. Although the Angel&#x27;s core is exposed in the center of the chest, it has a protective armor to hide it in case of danger. This ability suggests the enemy is aware of the N2 device and that there is some kind of communication system between the Angel specimens. After Zeruel defeats Eva-00 and Eva-02, it is finally defeated by Eva-01, which enters the berserk state to devour it, ingesting its S2 engine.

Zeruel&#x27;s first attack technique is similar to that of the &quot;Ultraman&quot; series&#x27;s Jet Beetle. Writer Virginie Nebbia also compared Zeruel to another &quot;Ultraman&quot; monster, Zetton. Zeruel is the angel of power, a reference to its physical strength. Its name can be translated as &quot;arm of God&quot;, to which its second offensive technique alludes. According to Will Raus, its limbs are as thin as a sheet of paper and suggest a pun on the Japanese words for and . The manga artist Yoshitō Asari collaborated in the conception of its basic structure. According to Asari; &quot;When I was asked to collaborate, I was told that the Angel&#x27;s body should appear slow and clumsy, but that it was so strong that it could make fun of [the Evangelion]&quot;.

In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, Zeruel is known as the tenth Angel. Asari again designed the creature; except for the skull, which is almost identical to the one in the classic series, the movie&#x27;s Zeruel has paper-like tentacles it wraps around its body like the bands of a mummy. During the fight, it devours Unit 00 with Rei Ayanami, assuming the appearance of an anthropomorphic female figure. For the likeness of the new Zeruel, the animators took inspiration from the monster King Joe from &quot;Ultraseven&quot; and an Angel in the original draft of the series, a cube-shaped &quot;origami Apostolo&quot; inspired by the Möbius strip. Its anthropomorphic female form is inspired by Riderman from &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;. Writer Virginie Nebbia also noted that Zeruel&#x27;s battle closely resembles the final battle in &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;.

===Arael===
 is the fifteenth Angel. It appears and remains in geostationary orbit for the entire duration of its observation. At first, it is motionless at a constant distance from Earth, deploying giant luminescent wings. Asuka Langley Soryu with her Eva-02 positions herself at the center of Tokyo-3 to intercept it, but the Angel begins to erode her mind using a wave that radars cannot detect. The Angel makes Asuka relive her childhood trauma in an attempt to investigate her mental wavelength by learning her mechanisms and rendering the human on board the Evangelion harmless. According to Ritsuko, Arael&#x27;s attack is an attempt to investigate the human heart and contact the unit&#x27;s pilot. The energetic light beam is visible to humans, a phenomenon attributed to the presence of an unknown energy, something similar to an AT Field. Units 00 attacks Arael with its firearm, but its attempts are thwarted by its strong AT Field. Arael is ultimately defeated by Eva-00 after it launches into orbit a weapon called Longinus&#x27; spear, quickly reaching Arael and piercing through its AT Field.

Virginie Nebbia compared Arael&#x27;s design with Perolynga from &quot;Ultraseven&quot;, and its exploration of Asuka&#x27;s mind with Solaris from the novel of the same name. Arael is the angel of birds; its bird-like appearance in the show is a reference to this. Its name means &quot;light&quot; or &quot;vision of God&quot;, which Will Raus interpreted as referenced by its beam of light. Arael was planned to appear in the nineteenth episode; it would appear in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and would use its twelve semi-transparent wings as a high-frequency cutting weapon. The Evangelion units would face it in an aerial confrontation, in which Shinji would attempt to save Asuka. The sequences of the psychological battle between the Angel and Asuka have been compared to Gestalt psychology, in particular by the field theory of the German psychologist Kurt Lewin, according to which each individual is part of a context in which each one creates a personal reality.

===Armisael===
 has a luminescent body and an ill-defined circular shape that later stabilizes above the valley of Ōwaku, rotating around its axis. Once its rotation stops, the Angel metamorphosizes into a string, It launches an attack against Unit 00, piercing its body at the level of the womb. Armisael seeks physical and mental contact with the target, violating the components of the unit, which is led by pilot Rei Ayanami. It is speculated Armisael continues Arael&#x27;s psychic incursion, launching into a communicative attack on Rei. Under attack, Rei loses her senses and inside her mind she meets another self that is Armisael, which sweetly speaks to her using the words from her own unconscious mind. The Angel asks Rei to unite with it to alleviate the pain caused by the attack. After awakening, Rei activates a process of self-destruction of her unit. Rei causes a violent explosion that engulfs and annihilates the Angel, and much of Tokyo-3.

Shortly before the explosion and the Angel&#x27;s defeat, Eva-00 assumes the silhouette of Rei Ayanami, with Armisael arranged on her head like a halo, an iconographic Christian attribute of angels and saints. Armisael, confirming the hypotheses of intercommunication between the Angels and the Angel being aware of their predecessors&#x27; experiences, is aware of the human psyche. In religious texts, Armisael is the angel of the womb; in Jewish tradition, a woman could relieve the pain of childbirth by invoking his name. During the battle on 00&#x27;s back, a heteromorphic organism with contours that recall the forms of the previous Angels develops. Armisael thus contains the genetic information of the other Angels. Its shape is similar to a double helix ring and has been compared with the DNA or a mathematical surface that cannot be oriented, such as the Möbius strip and the Klein&#x27;s bottle.

===Tabris===
 goes by the name of Kaworu Nagisa, and becomes the replacement pilot of Eva-02 after Asuka&#x27;s mental breakdown. After arriving in Tokyo-3, Tabris becomes a friend of Shinji Ikari, but betrays him and takes possession of Eva-02 in an attempt to break into the Terminal Dogma, where it believes Adam is kept. Upon discovering the giant guarded in Nerv is Lilith, Tabris decides to stop its attack and entrusts its fate to Shinji&#x27;s Unit 01, allowing itself to be killed. Writer Virginie Nebbia compared Kaworu&#x27;s role to Perolynga and Metron from &quot;Ultraseven&quot;. According to the &quot;Nuctemeron&quot; of Apollonius of Tyana, Tabris is a demon and the angel of free will. This is reflected in &quot;Evangelion&quot; Tabris’s choosing to die at the hands of Shinji. &quot;Nuctemeron&quot; also mentions a demon called Cahor, pronounced in Japanese, which is referred to as the angel of deception, a detail the &quot;Evangelion Chronicle&quot; encyclopedia relates to Tabris&#x27; deceptive, anthropomorphic appearance.

Like Arael and Armisael, who both attempt to make contact with Asuka&#x27;s and Rei&#x27;s souls, Kaworu aggressively tries to touch Shinji&#x27;s thoughts, but through peaceful human exchange rather than an open attack. Tabris claims that the Angels&#x27; AT Fields are the light of the soul and &quot;the walls of the heart,&quot; possessed by everyone, so it neutralizes Shinji&#x27;s AT Field by eliminating the emotional barriers around his metaphorical heart. Following previous Angels, which have taken various forms, Tabris adopted the form of a man by gathering information from its predecessors.

===Lilin===
, or , is the name used by Kaworu Nagisa to refer to human beings. In the movie &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, it is revealed humans are the eighteenth and final Angel, and direct descendants of Lilith. According to rabbinic scriptures, the Lilim, known as Lilin, are the children of Adam and his first wife, Lilith.

==In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;==
New Angels are introduced in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; film tetralogy, while reappearing Angels from the original series have an altered numbering. In the films, the Angels were made with three-dimensional and CG models, with the exception of the ninth and tenth Angels, which are based on Bardiel and Zeruel. A rainbow appears when the Angels are killed; according to Comic Book Resources&#x27; Danny Hernandez, the symbol may refer to Genesis, according to which God placed a rainbow in the sky by God as a testimony of His covenant with Noah. Writer Virginie Nebbia noted that a rainbow appears after Gorbagos death in &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot; and in &quot;&quot; (1988). In &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, the Angels do not have names; according to Masayuki, their names were excluded in the scripting phase because they were never used by the staff, who barely remembered them. 

The new Angels that appear in the films are:
*The . Its body, which is composed of bones, is similar to a snake skeleton. The third Angel is equipped with four small limbs for walking, an Evangelion cockpit, a tail and a long neck similar to wings which it uses to fly. It is unearthed from permafrost in the Palearctic, and is sealed by the European branch of Nerv to be researched and dissected. To kill its enemies, the third Angel uses light beams, which it uses to fight against Eva-05. The fight takes place in Bethany base, where it is defeated. Its basic design was conceived by Hideaki Anno, who during production thought of giving it the ability to spit acid, taking inspiration from the monster from &quot;Ultraman&quot;. Anno asked Mohiro Kitoh to redefine its appearance, suggesting something in the style of &quot;Narutaru&quot;. Writer Virginie Nebbia interpreted it as a possible homage to &quot;Ultraman&quot; Seabosu.
*The is shaped like a grandfather clock; its head is identical to Sachiel&#x27;s mask and is capable of rotating like the hands of a clock. It has a fake oscillating core that it uses as a decoy and an authentic core that is hidden inside its body. The seventh Angel moves by freezing the sea&#x27;s surface; it uses water to kill its enemies and is defeated by Eva-02. It reprises the role of Gaghiel, which appears in the eighth episode of the classic series. The seventh Angel was included in the movie due to technical necessity; the &quot;genga&quot; or key frames of the eighth episode were lost and the production staff rethought the entire scenario of Asuka&#x27;s arrival. It was designed by second unit director Daizen Komatsuda to resemble a drinking bird. The creature&#x27;s face is the work of animator Shigeto Koyama, while the body, which was designed by Anno, is inspired by the Toshiba IHI building at the 1970 Osaka Expo.
*The , which is introduced in the film &quot;&quot; (2012), takes the form of a set of black filaments that emerge from Mark.06 and is eventually killed as it gets eaten by Evangelion 13.

==In other media==
Angels appear in works based on &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; with different appearances and roles. In the comic book adaptation of the series, which was drawn by character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Sandalphon, Matarael, Iruel and Leliel do not appear and the number of Angels is reduced to twelve. More differences are introduced in the manga &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse&quot;, in which they are depicted as creatures that take possession of dead bodies to obtain gems called &quot;cores&quot;.

In the video game &quot;Shin seiki Evangelion: 2nd Impression&quot;, an Angel called is introduced. The Angel presents itself in different forms. In the first form, the Angel&#x27;s body is formed by disc-shaped plates, from which sprout small, scissor-like spines, and on the bottom some limbs similar to those of an insect. After a metamorphosis, it transforms into a pupa and then evolves into its final flying-insect-like form. In its third form, the Angel splits its AT Field and absorbs the energy of the Evangelion units. Original Angel&#x27;s core is hidden inside a girl named Mayumi Yamagishi. Mahiro Maeda worked on the Original Angel design.

In the board game , which was published by Kadokawa Shoten, Angels Sachiel, Shamshel, Ramiel, Gaghiel, Israfel, Materael and Sahaquiel, and two new Angels appear. The first, , has the appearance of a purple-colored mollusk. On the top of the shell is a graphic motif in the shape of a human eye. The second, called , is orange and spherical. Additional Angels appear in a board game called : , similar to an aquatic spore that shoots energy projectiles; is a humanoid Angel equipped with an energy cannon; is dinosaur-like and attacks with its claws; and is shaped like a virus and able to attack by manipulating gravity.

The Angels have also been used in video games based on the television series and other games detached from the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise, as in &quot;MapleStory&quot;, &quot;Million Arthur&quot;, &quot;Monster Hunter Explore&quot; and in the video games and &quot;Summons Board&quot; by GunHo Online Entertainment. In the &quot;Divine Gate&quot; video game by the same production company, Angels from &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; are depicted in anthropomorphic robes and have different names. An enemy similar to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; Angels appears in a crossover episode of the anime &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot;, whose design combines those of several &quot;Rebuild&quot; Angels.

==Cultural references and interpretations==
Writer Patrick Drazen analyzed the series&#x27; cosmology, comparing it with the Shinto cosmology presented in the texts of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon shoki&quot;. According to Drazen, the cosmogony proposed by Anno, despite the Judeo-Christian references, presents a strong Japanese background. He compared the First Impact, and the presence of the White Moon of the Angels and the Black Moon of humanity, to the Japanese myth on the origin of the world, according to which the cosmos was born from a primordial, chaotic, egg-like soup from which light and darkness were separated. The Spear of Longinus has also been compared with , the spear of the two creator &quot;kamis&quot; Izanagi and Izanami; according to the myth, the two creator deities formed the first island of the Japanese archipelago with the spear. Drazen, noting the Black Moon is placed on the Izu Peninsula, interpreted the mythopoiesis of the series as a cosmogony according to which all human life on Earth springs from Japan, as a hi-tech version of &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

According to writers Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, the use of Western religious symbols, such as cruciform explosions generated by Angels, leads one to think of Western beliefs as an alien invasion within &quot;Evangelion&quot;, but in their view the symbols are rooted in Anno&#x27;s insights into archetypes and Jungian psychology. Writers have interpreted &quot;Evangelion&quot; as a recreation of the Pacific War from the Japanese point of view, especially regarding the final apocalyptic events. Susan J. Napier, an American critic and writer, linked the monstrous creatures in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and other anime to the atomic bomb trauma suffered by the Japanese people after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Writer Virginie Nebbia similarly compared the Second Impact to the World War II and its consequences on Japan.

According to researcher Marcello Ghilardi, the Angels reflect the feelings of a part of Japanese youth of the 1990s, a time when Japanese society was in the midst of an economic crisis and when &quot;the ability to react and trust in the future seemed to have vanished&quot;, while the impossibility of clearly identifying the origin of the difficulties paralyzed society and made it made &quot;prey to a sense of expectation and precariousness&quot;. Their identification code, &quot;Blood Type – Blue&quot;, is an homage to the alternative title of the sci-fi film &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; (1978) by Kihachi Okamoto, an influential author for Anno. &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; manga editor Carl Gustav Horn also noted that in some doctrines of the Jewish Kabbalah angels are not conceived as alien entities, but as beings that were present and recently awakened in the Creation.

Critics compared the Angels to the &quot;kaijū&quot;, monsters typical of Japanese science fiction. Anime Academy reviewers linked &quot;Evangelion&quot; to earlier monster-of-the-week products, such as &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, tracing influences to &quot;Macross&quot; and the works of Gō Nagai. Art magazine &quot;Real Time&quot; also analyzed the Angels, saying their design reflects ancient and modern archetypes, comparing them to Aztec paintings, Joan Miró murals and Donald Judd cubes. IGN&#x27;s Ramsey Isler interpreted the battles against the Angels as a metaphor for Anno&#x27;s attempts to defeat his internal demons and depression.

Scholar Mariana Ortega, noting the mythological Lilith represents &quot;the Other Side&quot;, a dark world in which deep libidinal and unconscious desires are not controlled, interpreted &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; as a possible tale of psychic struggles between ego and unconscious, Jungian shadow and anima/animus. According to Ortega, the purpose of the Nerv, the Seele and the Angels is &quot;a kind of return to an original womb&quot;. Other scholars have described the Angels as representations of the Other that Shinji must face to form his identity, while Japanese writer Kotani Mari interpreted them as a representation of the concept of abjection, which was formulated by philosopher Julia Kristeva. Susan Napier, noting the Angels are explicitly associated with Gendo throughout the series, described them as father figures. Hideaki Anno himself compared Gendo and the first Angel Adam to father figures, saying he took inspiration from the Oedipal complex postulated by Sigmund Freud.

==Cultural impact==
===Popularity and critical reception===
The Angels&#x27; designs and fighting styles received positive reviews from critics and audiences. In 2017 the news magazine Livedoor News opened a survey asking the fans to choose their favorite Angel; in the poll, Adam and Ramiel ranked first and second, respectively. The magazine, talking about the reasons for Ramiel&#x27;s popularity, discussed the beauty of its geometric features and felt sorry for Arael&#x27;s low position of the eleventh place. Anime News Network&#x27;s Nick Creamer praised the first confrontation against Sachiel, calling its disc face &quot;iconic&quot;. Creamer also lauded the battles against the Angels, describing them as &quot;a captivating combination of eerily distinct monster designs, creative tactical setups, and gorgeous, horrifying fight animation&quot;.

The synchronized battle against Israfel received positive reviews from critics. Comic Book Resources described the fight as one of the best action scenes in the entire series. The fights against Bardiel and Zeruel also drew positive opinions. The US magazine &quot;Anime Invasion&quot; ranked the Zeruel battle as the eighth-best fight in Japanese animation history. Martin Theron of Anime News Network and Nicole MacLean of THEM Anime Reviews also made positive comments about their design, describing them as &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; and &quot;nothing short of astounding&quot;. Anime News Network&#x27;s Justin Sevakis appreciated the omission of their names in the first two installments of the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; film tetralogy, lacking the Judeo-Christian references from the original series, which he described as &quot;confusing and problematic&quot;.

===Merchandise and legacy===
Images of the Angels have been used to produce merchandising items, such as action figures, T-shirts, paperweights, bags, underwear, collectible models and foodstuffs. In 2005, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first airing of the series, manga artist Mine Yoshizaki designed several action figures of the Angels in anthropomorphic likenesses for a line titled Angel XX; among the various models, he designed Lilith and Sachiel puppets inspired by Rei Ayanami&#x27;s character design. The website Evastore, the official distributor of articles and merchandise inspired by &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, adopted as its mascot an Angel named Yuru-Shito, which was later used for products and an official role-playing game of the series.

According to Guido Tavassi, a scholar and critic of Japanese animation, the &quot;revolutionary&quot; appearance of the Angels is among the stylistic innovations introduced by the anime, &quot;[which] proposes a complete abstraction of the shapes of the enemies ... with a choice that will have an enormous impact on the design of the series of the [mecha] genre that followed&quot;. Matarael&#x27;s design inspired Nobuhiro Watsuki to create the eye costume of Usui Uonuma, one of the characters in the manga &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. Leliel inspired Yūichirō Oguro to create the enemies of &quot;Gekiganger 3&quot;, the aliens of the Kyo&#x27;akk Empire who come from a dimension called &quot;Dark String Universe&quot;. Staff of &quot;&quot; also took inspiration from the Angels of &quot;Evangelion&quot; for the design of the panda Hei Bei.

Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy have traced a possible &quot;Evangelion&quot; influence on the Dolems, &quot;RahXephon&quot; main antagonists. For &quot;Sci Fi Weekly&quot; Tasha Robinson, &quot;Aquarion&quot; Shadow Angels can also be influenced by &quot;Evangelion&quot; Angels. IGN&#x27;s Jemima Sebastian compared a scene in &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, in which King Kong on a ship suffers an underwater attack from Godzilla, to the fight between Gaghiel and Eva-02 from the eighth episode of the series. The same author also noted how an evolution of Algomon presented in the &quot;Digimon&quot; anime is reminiscent of the designs of certain Angels from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Sachiel&#x27;s design inspired Jordan Vogt-Roberts for &quot;&quot;s Skullcrawler. &quot;Polygon&quot; compared the unfurled design of the flying cryptid movie monster Jean Jacket in Jordan Peele&#x27;s &quot;Nope&quot; with Sahaquiel. On July 25, 2022, &quot;Slashfilm&quot; confirmed via Peele&#x27;s production notes for &quot;Nope&quot; that Jean Jacket had been specifically inspired by the Angels of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;; Peele himself stated that he was particularly influenced by their &quot;hyper minimalism&quot; and &quot;biomechanical design flair&quot;. The creators of the video game &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; also drew inspiration from Ramiel&#x27;s design for the conception of some life forms called Hypostasis.

<text>Teddybears (formerly Teddybears STHLM) is a Swedish music group formed in Stockholm in 1991. The group consists of members Patrik Arve, Joakim Åhlund, and Klas Åhlund. Initially starting as a hardcore punk band, Teddybears began to incorporate a variety of sounds from hip hop, pop, rock, dancehall, and electronica after a few years.

The band was originally named Skull but changed its name to Teddybears Sthlm shortly before Klas Åhlund joined the group. In 2006, the band dropped “Sthlm” from its name and became simply Teddybears.

==Career==
===1991 - 1992===

Joakim Åhlund was a member of the grindcore band Skull, alongside Glenn Sundell, Patrik Lindqvist, and Jens Näsström. For a period, Åhlund left the band, and during his absence, Patrik Arve joined as the vocalist. Åhlund later returned, and it was then that he got to know Arve, leading to the band changing its name from Skull to Teddybears Sthlm. In an interview with Göteborgs-Tidningen, Joakim Åhlund explained the reason behind the name change: &quot;We wanted to avoid clichés; stuff like Kill Death Fuck Squad Bunch Murder and ... well, that kind of thing. And actually, it&#x27;s better to call ourselves Teddybears in that case.&quot; The addition of &quot;Sthlm&quot; was intended to indicate their origins, with Patrik Arve noting in the same interview that the idea came from &quot;the rockers and their vests. It also annoys people in Gothenburg and Malmö.&quot;

Teddybears&#x27; first public appearance took place during a Lucia celebration at a church in Farsta in 1991, where an anti-drug event was being held. The audience, consisting of seven youths and a priest, witnessed the band, led by Patrik Arve, performing with their trousers pulled down. The guitarist for this gig was Reine Fiske, who is now a member of Dungen and Träd, Gräs och Stenar.

The band&#x27;s debut record, &quot;Women in Pain&quot;, was released in 1991 on Isse Samie&#x27;s record label, Dolores Recordings, in Gothenburg. &quot;Women in Pain&quot;, which sold over 7,000 copies, included tracks such as &quot;The King Lives On&quot; (about Elvis Presley) and &quot;Servants of Authority.&quot;

After several member changes, with Martin Renck playing guitar for a while, Joakim Åhlund&#x27;s brother Klas joined the band. Upon their emergence on the Swedish rock scene in 1991, Teddybears were noted for their unique genre, appearances, hard music, and energetic stage performances. In February 1992, the band played at Tre Backar in Stockholm, where after the gig, Aftonbladet&#x27;s critic Anna Björkman lauded their performance, writing: &quot;music in machine gun form and when Teddybears play live, the fans stage dive unrestrainedly from the about half-meter high Tre Backar stage.&quot;

Later that year, the band signed a record deal with MVG Records and released the EP &quot;Extra Pleasure&quot; on the label in 1993.

===1993 – 1999===

====You are Teddybears (1993)====

Teddybears&#x27; debut album, &quot;You Are Teddybears&quot; (released by MVG), was released on December 15, 1993. The band initially sought Michael B Tretow, famed for his work with ABBA, to produce the album, but he declined. Consequently, Teddybears took on the production role themselves. The album, clocking in at 37 minutes, boasts an uncompromising hardcore punk sound across its 17 tracks. Its cover art provocatively features a pentagram in blue and yellow, the colors of the Swedish flag. Joakim Åhlund expressed his astonishment in Göteborgs-Tidningen that the controversial symbol hadn&#x27;t sparked more reactions, highlighting it as “a devil&#x27;s star in the colours of the Swedish flag.”

The album elicited varied reactions from the press. Sound Affects magazine described it as &quot;The most painful earache Svensson has ever encountered. A definite investment.&quot; In contrast, guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen offered a less favorable review in Metal Zone magazine, disparagingly commenting, &quot;sucks ass! (...) Polka beat on the drums! A singer that BLOWS into the mic! Damn, I hate this kind of stuff!&quot;

====I can’t believe it’s Teddybears Sthlm (1996)====

For Teddybears&#x27; second album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Teddybears Sthlm&quot; (MVG), Christian Falk was hired as the producer. The album was released on February 23, 1996. This period also saw Erik Olsson replacing Glenn Sundell on drums.

&quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Teddybears Sthlm&quot; includes a cover of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;The Robots,&quot; which they began performing while touring in Germany. Two of the songs on the album have boy&#x27;s names. &quot;Jim&quot; is named after Joakim&#x27;s son, and the final song &quot;Boris&quot; is named after Patrik&#x27;s favorite author, Boris Vian.

===2000 – 2005===

====Rock ’n’ Roll Highschool (2000)====

With the release of &quot;Rock ’n’ Roll Highschool&quot; (MVG/MNW), the band achieved commercial breakthrough. The album reached first place on the Swedish album chart. During the Grammis Awards in 2001, the band was awarded four Grammis, among them for Album of the Year and Pop/Rock Group of the Year. The jury&#x27;s motivation read: &quot;besides being a wonderful melting pot of all new music, Teddybears succeed in chiseling out several big hits.&quot;

&quot;Rock ’n’ Roll Highschool&quot; was released on June 7, 2000, and was produced by the band themselves along with Fabian Torsson. The album name is taken from the movie &quot;Rock ’n’ Roll High School&quot; (1979), in which The Ramones, among others, appeared. With the album, the band left hardcore punk behind in favour of a distinctive version of electronic pop with elements of hip-hop and reggae.

&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Highschool&quot; and &quot;Yours to Keep&quot; were released as singles. The song &quot;Punkrocker&quot; was also recorded that same year by Joakim Åhlund&#x27;s other band, Caesars Palace, as well as by Thomas Rusiak featuring Teddybears, under the title &quot;Hiphopper.&quot;

====Fresh (2004)====

Four years later, the fourth album &quot;Fresh&quot; (Sony Music) was released on March 26, 2004. Like the previous album, it was produced by the band themselves along with Fabian Torsson.

The fixed roles that the band members previously had were now essentially completely dissolved. Dagens Nyheter wrote on March 23, 2004: &quot;Klas is not just a guitarist, often not at all. Joakim doesn&#x27;t play the bass any more than anyone else in Teddybears, he believes. And the singer Patrik Arve - never sings.&quot; On &quot;Fresh&quot;, the vocalist changes with each song, and among the contributors is Mad Cobra on &quot;Cobrastyle&quot; and a mysterious street musician the band found, who called himself Lord of Lightning, guest sings on &quot;The Lord&#x27;s 115th Dream.&quot;

&quot;Fresh&quot; includes the song &quot;Cobrastyle,&quot; which has been streamed over 70 million times on Spotify. The song has appeared in the movies &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; and &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; from 2006, commercials for Heineken and WWE (American wrestling), the TV series &quot;Entourage,&quot; and in the video games FIFA 06, FIFA 23, and Forza Motorsport 2. Charli XCX sampled Robyn&#x27;s version of &quot;Cobrastyle&quot; for the song &quot;Speed Drive&quot; on &quot;Barbie the Album.&quot;

The music video for &quot;Cobrastyle,&quot; shot in Cuba with Mad Cobra at the Cuban film institute Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC), features a stop-motion gorilla and robot cobra battling it out in front of a mountain range, providing a visual backdrop to Teddybears and Mad Cobra&#x27;s performance.

===2006 – present===

In 2005, Teddybears began to wear bear masks on stage and in media contexts. The masks were not just a visual idea but also freed up time for the band members: &quot;Being an artist can sometimes feel like being in Top Model. You go around in a tour bus and do press and spend a lot of time discussing with stylists and getting makeup done for concerts and TV appearances. We decided to eliminate that part by always wearing bear heads.&quot;

The origin of the bear masks comes from Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;The Magic Flute,&quot; where the first bear mask appeared. It was when Patrik Arve shared a studio with the artist and puppet maker Arne Högsander, the creator of the papier-mâché bear mask for Bergman, that Teddybears ordered several of the same kind.

In 2006, the band dropped &quot;Sthlm&quot; from their name and became simply &quot;Teddybears.&quot;

====Soft Machine (2006)====

With Teddybears&#x27; fifth album &quot;Soft Machine&quot;, they made their album debut in the USA on Atlantic Records. The album was released on September 12, 2006, and was a special edition for the American market where one of the guest artists is Iggy Pop, who guest sings on &quot;Punkrocker.&quot; The album was praised in the American cultural magazine Entertainment Weekly as &quot;the very distillation of sunshine.&quot;

&quot;Soft Machine&quot; contains six tracks from &quot;Fresh&quot;, five remixed hits from &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Highschool&quot;, and one entirely new song, &quot;Riot Going On,&quot; where Ebbot Lundberg sings&quot;.&quot; 

In 2004, Teddybears hired the Värmland orchestra Torgny Melins as the opening act for one of their concerts to perform dance band interpretations of Teddybears songs, including &quot;Punkrocker&quot; renamed to &quot;Dansbander.&quot; The performance was a success for Torgny Melins, and the dance band released a whole album of Teddybears interpretations that same year, called &quot;Dansbander.&quot;

With &quot;Soft Machine&quot;, Teddybears toured North America and Mexico. In 2007, the band played on the third day of the Coachella Music Festival 2007, which took place at Empire Polo Field in Indio, California. That same year, they performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; where they played in the same episode as Alice Cooper. In 2008, they appeared on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and performed the song &quot;Cobrastyle&quot; together with Robyn.

====Devil’s Music (2010)====

Teddybears&#x27; sixth album &quot;Devil&#x27;s Music&quot; (Sony Music) was released on March 24, 2010. This album also features several guest artists, including world stars Cee Lo Green, The Flaming Lips, The B-52&#x27;s, and Eve, along with Swedish names such as Mapei, Rigo, ADL, and Desmond Foster.

In Dagens Industri, Jan Gradvall wrote the following about the album: “Artists who in this way combine ‘state of the art’ production and classic pop songwriting with adrenaline, anarchism, attack - and also have a visual thinking - are extremely rare.&quot;

On January 22, 2010, Teddybears opened the P3 Gold Gala at the Scandinavium, premiering the song &quot;Rocket Scientist&quot; from the album.

====Don Carlos====

On May 31, 2010, Teddybears presented the set &quot;Teddybears vs Don Carlos&quot; on the main stage of the Royal Dramatic Theatre (Dramaten) together with actors from the Don Carlos ensemble. Johanna Paulsson, a critic for Dagens Nyheter, wrote about the performance: &quot;Just making something so retrospective sound innovative is an achievement in itself, and Teddybears at the theater are far from being party animals. For this kind of project, they don&#x27;t even need celebrity guest vocalists, not even the actors on stage. The bears have never sounded so multi-layered before.&quot;

The year before, Klas Åhlund had written the music for Staffan Valdemar Holm&#x27;s original production of Schiller&#x27;s Don Carlos. The music from the performance was recorded by Teddybears and released as a vinyl album that was only sold at the Dramaten performance.

====Rock on! (2016)====

On January 22, 2016, Teddybears released their sixth and latest album &quot;Rock On!&quot;. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, Atlanta, London, and Jamaica. Among the guest artists on the album are Beenie Man, Cutty Ranks, and Ninja Man, as well as former Boyz In Da Hood member Gorilla Zoe, and then 12-year-old Baby Trish who sings on &quot;What’s Your Problem.&quot;

Baby Trish came to Sweden to record a music video for &quot;What’s Your Problem?&quot; as well as to perform with Teddybears at the 2015 Grammis Awards. The band used the performance to make a statement against racism. Words related to sexual orientation, ethnic origin, and religious affiliation followed by an equal sign and the word &quot;Swedish&quot; were projected on screens around the stage. This was in response to a statement by Björn Söder (SD) in which he had spoken about who was ethnically Swedish or not.

In 2014, Teddybears made a similar statement when they printed band merchandise with the text &quot;SD = racists&quot; which they used during a performance on the TV4 program &quot;Sommarkrysset.&quot;

On January 30, 2017, the documentary &quot;You are Teddybears&quot; premiered at the Gothenburg Film Festival and on July 23, 2017, it was broadcast on SVT. The documentary was directed by John Boisen and Björn Fävremark.

<doc id="284027" wikidata="Q476921" url="?curid=284027" title="Kidney failure">
<text>Kidney failure, also known as renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a medical condition in which the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste products from the blood, functioning at less than 15% of normal levels. Kidney failure is classified as either acute kidney failure, which develops rapidly and may resolve; and chronic kidney failure, which develops slowly and can often be irreversible. Symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications of acute and chronic failure include uremia, hyperkalemia, and volume overload. Complications of chronic failure also include heart disease, high blood pressure, and anaemia.
Causes of acute kidney failure include low blood pressure, blockage of the urinary tract, certain medications, muscle breakdown, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Causes of chronic kidney failure include diabetes, high blood pressure, nephrotic syndrome, and polycystic kidney disease. Diagnosis of acute failure is often based on a combination of factors such as decreased urine production or increased serum creatinine. Diagnosis of chronic failure is based on a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 15 or the need for renal replacement therapy. It is also equivalent to stage 5 chronic kidney disease.
Treatment of acute failure depends on the underlying cause. Treatment of chronic failure may include hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or a kidney transplant. Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter the blood outside the body. In peritoneal dialysis specific fluid is placed into the abdominal cavity and then drained, with this process being repeated multiple times per day. Kidney transplantation involves surgically placing a kidney from someone else and then taking immunosuppressant medication to prevent rejection. Other recommended measures from chronic disease include staying active and specific dietary changes. Depression is also common among patients with kidney failure, and is associated with poor outcomes including higher risk of kidney function decline, hospitalization, and death. A recent PCORI-funded study of patients with kidney failure receiving outpatient hemodialysis found similar effectiveness between nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments for depression.
In the United States, acute failure affects about 3 per 1,000 people a year. Chronic failure affects about 1 in 1,000 people with 3 per 10,000 people newly developing the condition each year. In Canada, the lifetime risk of kidney failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was estimated to be 2.66% for men and 1.76% for women. Acute failure is often reversible while chronic failure often is not. With appropriate treatment many with chronic disease can continue working.

== Classification ==
Kidney failure can be divided into two categories: acute kidney failure or chronic kidney failure. The type of renal failure is differentiated by the trend in the serum creatinine; other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney failure from chronic kidney failure include anemia and the kidney size on sonography as chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size.

=== Acute kidney failure ===
Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a rapidly progressive loss of renal function, generally characterized by oliguria (decreased urine production, quantified as less than 400 mL per day in adults, less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children or less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants); and fluid and electrolyte imbalance. AKI can result from a variety of causes, generally classified as &quot;prerenal&quot;, &quot;intrinsic&quot;, and &quot;postrenal&quot;. Many people diagnosed with paraquat intoxication experience AKI, sometimes requiring hemodialysis. The underlying cause must be identified and treated to arrest the progress, and dialysis may be necessary to bridge the time gap required for treating these fundamental causes.

===Chronic kidney failure===

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can also develop slowly and, initially, show few symptoms. CKD can be the long term consequence of irreversible acute disease or part of a disease progression. CKD is divided into 5 different stages (1–5) according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In CKD1 eGFR is normal and in CKD5 eGFR has decreased to less than 15 ml/min.

=== Acute-on-chronic kidney failure ===
Acute kidney injuries can be present on top of chronic kidney disease, a condition called acute-on-chronic kidney failure (AoCRF). The acute part of AoCRF may be reversible, and the goal of treatment, as with AKI, is to return the person to baseline kidney function, typically measured by serum creatinine. Like AKI, AoCRF can be difficult to distinguish from chronic kidney disease if the person has not been monitored by a physician and no baseline (i.e., past) blood work is available for comparison.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms can vary from person to person. Someone in early stage kidney disease may not feel sick or notice symptoms as they occur. When the kidneys fail to filter properly, waste accumulates in the blood and the body, a condition called azotemia. Very low levels of azotemia may produce few, if any, symptoms. If the disease progresses, symptoms become noticeable (if the failure is of sufficient degree to cause symptoms). Kidney failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed uraemia.

Symptoms of kidney failure include the following:
* High levels of urea in the blood, which can result in:
** Vomiting or diarrhea (or both) that may lead to dehydration
** Nausea
** Weight loss
** Nocturnal urination (nocturia)
** More frequent urination, or in greater amounts than usual, with pale urine
** Less frequent urination, or in smaller amounts than usual, with dark coloured urine
** Blood in the urine
** Pressure, or difficulty urinating
** Unusual amounts of urination, usually in large quantities
* A buildup of phosphates in the blood that diseased kidneys cannot filter out may cause:
** Itching
** Bone damage
** Nonunion in broken bones
** Muscle cramps (caused by low levels of calcium which can be associated with hyperphosphatemia)
* A buildup of potassium in the blood that diseased kidneys cannot filter out (called hyperkalemia) may cause:
** Abnormal heart rhythms
** Muscle paralysis
* Failure of kidneys to remove excess fluid may cause:
** Swelling of the hands, legs, ankles, feet, or face
** Shortness of breath due to extra fluid on the lungs (may also be caused by anemia)
* Polycystic kidney disease, which causes large, fluid-filled cysts on the kidneys and sometimes the liver, can cause:
** Pain in the back or side
* Healthy kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin that stimulates the bone marrow to make oxygen-carrying red blood cells. As the kidneys fail, they produce less erythropoietin, resulting in decreased production of red blood cells to replace the natural breakdown of old red blood cells. As a result, the blood carries less hemoglobin, a condition known as anemia. This can result in:
** Feeling tired or weak
** Memory problems
** Difficulty concentrating
** Dizziness
** Low blood pressure
* Normally proteins are too large to pass through the kidneys. However they are able to pass through when the glomeruli are damaged. This does not cause symptoms until extensive kidney damage has occurred, after which symptoms include:
** Foamy or bubbly urine
** Swelling in the hands, feet, abdomen, and face
* Other symptoms include:
** Appetite loss, which may include a bad taste in the mouth
** Difficulty sleeping
** Darkening of the skin
** Excess protein in the blood
** With high doses of penicillin, people with kidney failure may experience seizures

== Causes ==

=== Acute kidney injury ===

Acute kidney injury (previously known as acute renal failure) – or AKI – usually occurs when the blood supply to the kidneys is suddenly interrupted or when the kidneys become overloaded with toxins. Causes of acute kidney injury include accidents, injuries, or complications from surgeries in which the kidneys are deprived of normal blood flow for extended periods of time. Heart-bypass surgery is an example of one such procedure.

Drug overdoses, accidental or from chemical overloads of drugs such as antibiotics or chemotherapy, along with bee stings may also cause the onset of acute kidney injury. Unlike chronic kidney disease, however, the kidneys can often recover from acute kidney injury, allowing the person with AKI to resume a normal life. People with acute kidney injury require supportive treatment until their kidneys recover function, and they often remain at increased risk of developing future kidney failure.

Among the accidental causes of renal failure is the crush syndrome, when large amounts of toxins are suddenly released in the blood circulation after a long compressed limb is suddenly relieved from the pressure obstructing the blood flow through its tissues, causing ischemia. The resulting overload can lead to the clogging and the destruction of the kidneys. It is a reperfusion injury that appears after the release of the crushing pressure. The mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products – notably myoglobin, potassium, and phosphorus – that are the products of rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by ischemic conditions). The specific action on the kidneys is not fully understood, but may be due in part to nephrotoxic metabolites of myoglobin.

=== Chronic kidney failure ===

Chronic kidney failure has numerous causes. The most common causes of chronic failure are diabetes mellitus and long-term, uncontrolled hypertension. Polycystic kidney disease is another well-known cause of chronic failure. The majority of people affected with polycystic kidney disease have a family history of the disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also a known cause of chronic kidney failure. Other genetic illnesses cause kidney failure, as well.

Overuse of common drugs such as ibuprofen, and acetaminophen (paracetamol) can also cause chronic kidney failure.

Some infectious disease agents, such as hantavirus, can attack the kidneys, causing kidney failure.

=== Genetic predisposition ===
The &quot;APOL1&quot; gene has been proposed as a major genetic risk locus for a spectrum of nondiabetic renal failure in individuals of African origin, these include HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), primary nonmonogenic forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension affiliated chronic kidney disease not attributed to other etiologies. Two western African variants in APOL1 have been shown to be associated with end stage kidney disease in African Americans and Hispanic Americans.

== Diagnostic approach ==

=== Measurement for CKD ===
;Stages of kidney failure

Chronic kidney failure is measured in five stages, which are calculated using the person&#x27;s GFR, or glomerular filtration rate. Stage 1 CKD is mildly diminished renal function, with few overt symptoms. Stages 2 and 3 need increasing levels of supportive care from their medical providers to slow and treat their renal dysfunction. People with stage 4 and 5 kidney failure usually require preparation towards active treatment in order to survive. Stage 5 CKD is considered a severe illness and requires some form of renal replacement therapy (dialysis) or kidney transplant whenever feasible.

;Glomerular filtration rate

A normal GFR varies according to many factors, including sex, age, body size and ethnic background. Renal professionals consider the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to be the best overall index of kidney function. The National Kidney Foundation offers an easy to use on-line GFR calculator for anyone who is interested in knowing their glomerular filtration rate. (A serum creatinine level, a simple blood test, is needed to use the calculator.)

=== Use of the term &quot;uremia&quot; ===
Before the advancement of modern medicine, renal failure was often referred to as uremic poisoning. Uremia was the term for the contamination of the blood with urea. It is the presence of an excessive amount of urea in blood. Starting around 1847, this included reduced urine output, which was thought to be caused by the urine mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra. The term &quot;uremia&quot; is now used for the illness accompanying kidney failure.

=== Renal failure index ===
Two other urinary indices, are the fractional sodium excretion (FENa) index and the renal failure index (RFI). The renal failure index is equal to urine sodium times plasma creatinine divided by urine creatinine. A FENa score greater than 3% or a renal failure index (RFI) greater than 3 are helpful in confirming acute renal failure.

== Complications ==
Those with end stage renal failure who undergo haemodialysis have higher risk of spontaneous intra-abdominal bleeding than the general population (21.2%) and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (18.1%). Meanwhile, those undergoing peritoneal dialysis have a higher chance of developing peritonitis and gastrointestinal perforation. However, the rate of acute pancreatitis does not differ from the general population.

== Treatment ==

The treatment of acute kidney injury depends on the cause. The treatment of chronic kidney failure may include renal replacement therapy: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplant.

=== Diet ===
In non-diabetics and people with type 1 diabetes, a low protein diet is found to have a preventive effect on progression of chronic kidney disease. However, this effect does not apply to people with type 2 diabetes. A whole food, plant-based diet may help some people with kidney disease. A high protein diet from either animal or plant sources appears to have negative effects on kidney function at least in the short term.

=== Slowing progression ===
People who receive earlier referrals to a nephrology specialist, meaning a longer time before they must start dialysis, have a shorter initial hospitalization and reduced risk of death after the start of dialysis. Other methods of reducing disease progression include minimizing exposure to nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs and intravenous contrast.

<text>Immunization, or immunisation, is the process by which an individual&#x27;s immune system becomes fortified against an infectious agent (known as the immunogen). When this system is exposed to molecules that are foreign to the body, called &quot;non-self&quot;, it will orchestrate an immune response, and it will also develop the ability to quickly respond to a subsequent encounter because of immunological memory. This is a function of the adaptive immune system. Therefore, by exposing a human, or an animal, to an immunogen in a controlled way, its body can learn to protect itself: this is called active immunization. The most important elements of the immune system that are improved by immunization are the T cells, B cells, and the antibodies B cells produce. Memory B cells and memory T cells are responsible for a swift response to a second encounter with a foreign molecule. Passive immunization is direct introduction of these elements into the body, instead of production of these elements by the body itself.

Immunization happens in various ways, both in the wild and as done by human efforts in health care. Natural immunity is gained by those organisms whose immune systems succeed in fighting off a previous infection, if the relevant pathogen is one for which immunization is even possible. Natural immunity can have degrees of effectiveness (partial rather than absolute) and may fade over time (within months, years, or decades, depending on the pathogen). In health care, the main technique of artificial induction of immunity is vaccination, which is a major form of prevention of disease, whether by prevention of infection (pathogen fails to mount sufficient reproduction in the host), prevention of severe disease (infection still happens but is not severe), or both. Vaccination against vaccine-preventable diseases is a major relief of disease burden even though it usually cannot eradicate a disease. Vaccines against microorganisms that cause diseases can prepare the body&#x27;s immune system, thus helping to fight or prevent an infection. The fact that mutations can cause cancer cells to produce proteins or other molecules that are known to the body forms the theoretical basis for therapeutic cancer vaccines. Other molecules can be used for immunization as well, for example in experimental vaccines against nicotine (NicVAX) or the hormone ghrelin in experiments to create an obesity vaccine.

Immunizations are often widely stated as less risky and an easier way to become immune to a particular disease than risking a milder form of the disease itself. They are important for both adults and children in that they can protect us from the many diseases out there. Immunization not only protects children against deadly diseases but also helps in developing children&#x27;s immune systems. Through the use of immunizations, some infections and diseases have almost completely been eradicated throughout the World. One example is polio. Thanks to dedicated health care professionals and the parents of children who vaccinated on schedule, polio has been eliminated in the U.S. since 1979. Polio is still found in other parts of the world so certain people could still be at risk of getting it. This includes those people who have never had the vaccine, those who did not receive all doses of the vaccine, or those traveling to areas of the world where polio is still prevalent. Active immunization/vaccination has been named one of the &quot;Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century&quot;.

==History==

Before the introduction of vaccines, people could only become immune to an infectious disease by contracting the disease and surviving it. Smallpox (variola) was prevented in this way by inoculation, which produced a milder effect than the natural disease. The first clear reference to smallpox inoculation was made by the Chinese author Wan Quan (1499–1582) in his &quot;Douzhen xinfa&quot; (痘疹心法) published in 1549. In China, powdered smallpox scabs were blown up the noses of the healthy. The patients would then develop a mild case of the disease and from then on were immune to it. The technique did have a 0.5–2.0% mortality rate, but that was considerably less than the 20–30% mortality rate of the disease itself. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. According to Voltaire (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation from neighbouring Circassia. Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it &quot;these hundred years&quot;. It was introduced into England from Turkey by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in 1721 and used by Zabdiel Boylston in Boston the same year. In 1798 Edward Jenner introduced inoculation with cowpox (smallpox vaccine), a much safer procedure. This procedure, referred to as vaccination, gradually replaced smallpox inoculation, now called variolation to distinguish it from vaccination. Until the 1880s vaccine/vaccination referred only to smallpox, but Louis Pasteur developed immunization methods for chicken cholera and anthrax in animals and for human rabies, and suggested that the terms vaccine/vaccination should be extended to cover the new procedures. This can cause confusion if care is not taken to specify which vaccine is used e.g. measles vaccine or influenza vaccine.

==Passive and active immunization==

Immunization can be achieved in an active or passive manner: vaccination is an active form of immunization.

===Active immunization===
Active immunization can occur naturally when a person comes in contact with, for example, a microbe. The immune system will eventually create antibodies and other defenses against the microbe. The next time, the immune response against this microbe can be very efficient; this is the case in many of the childhood infections that a person only contracts once, but then is immune.

Artificial active immunization is where the microbe, or parts of it, are injected into the person before they are able to take it in naturally. If whole microbes are used, they are pre-treated.

The importance of immunization is so great that the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has named it one of the &quot;Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century&quot;.
Live attenuated vaccines have decreased pathogenicity. Their effectiveness depends on the immune systems ability to replicate and elicits a response similar to natural infection. It is usually effective with a single dose. Examples of live, attenuated vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella, MMR, yellow fever, varicella, rotavirus, and influenza (LAIV).

===Passive immunization===

Passive immunization is where pre-synthesized elements of the immune system are transferred to a person so that the body does not need to produce these elements itself. Currently, antibodies can be used for passive immunization. This method of immunization begins to work very quickly, but it is short lasting, because the antibodies are naturally broken down, and if there are no B cells to produce more antibodies, they will disappear.

Passive immunization occurs physiologically, when antibodies are transferred from mother to fetus during pregnancy, to protect the fetus before and shortly after birth.

Artificial passive immunization is normally administered by injection and is used if there has been a recent outbreak of a particular disease or as an emergency treatment for toxicity, as in for tetanus. The antibodies can be produced in animals, called &quot;serum therapy,&quot; although there is a high chance of anaphylactic shock because of immunity against animal serum itself. Thus, humanized antibodies produced &quot;in vitro&quot; by cell culture are used instead if available.

==Economics of immunizations==

===Positive externality===
Immunizations impose what is known as a positive consumer externality on society. In addition to providing the individual with protection against certain antigens it adds greater protection to all other individuals in society through herd immunity. Because this extra protection is not accounted for in the market transactions for immunizations we see an undervaluing of the marginal benefit of each immunization. This market failure is caused by individuals making decisions based on their private marginal benefit instead of the social marginal benefit. Society&#x27;s undervaluing of immunizations means that through normal market transactions we end up at a quantity that is lower than what is socially optimal.

For example, if individual A values their own immunity to an antigen at $100 but the immunization costs $150, individual A will decide against receiving immunization. However, if the added benefit of herd immunity means person B values person A&#x27;s immunity at $70 then the total social marginal benefit of their immunization is $170. Individual A&#x27;s private marginal benefit being lower than the social marginal benefit leads to an under-consumption of immunizations.

=== Socially optimal outcome ===
Having private marginal benefits lower than social marginal benefits will always lead to an under-consumption of any good. The size of the disparity is determined by the value that society places on each different immunization. Many times, immunizations do not reach a socially optimum quantity high enough to eradicate the antigen. Instead, they reach a social quantity that allows for an optimal amount of sick individuals. Most of the commonly immunized diseases in the United States still see a small presence with occasional larger outbreaks. Measles is a good example of a disease whose social optimum leaves enough room for outbreaks in the United States that often lead to the deaths of a handful of individuals.

There are also examples of illnesses so dangerous that the social optimum ended with the eradication of the virus, such as smallpox. In these cases, the social marginal benefit is so large that society is willing to pay the cost to reach a level of immunization that makes the spread and survival of the disease impossible.

Despite the severity of certain illnesses, the cost of immunization versus the social marginal benefit means that total eradication is not always the end goal of immunization. Though it is hard to tell exactly where the socially optimal outcome is, we know that it is not the eradication of all disease for which an immunization exists.

=== Internalizing the externality ===
In order to internalize the positive externality imposed by immunizations payments equal to the marginal benefit must be made. In countries like the United States these payment usually come in the form of subsidies from the government. Before 1962 immunization programs in the United States were run on the local and state level of governments. The inconsistency in subsidies lead to some regions of the United States reaching the socially optimal quantity while other regions were left without subsidies and remained at the private marginal benefit level of immunizations. Since 1962 and the Vaccination Assistance Act, the United States as a whole has been moving towards the socially optimal outcome on a larger scale. Despite government subsidies it is difficult to tell when social optimum has been achieved. In addition to hardships determining the true social marginal benefit of immunizations we see cultural movements shifting private marginal benefit curves. Vaccine controversies have changed the way some private citizens view the marginal benefit of being immunized. If Individual A believes that there is a large health risk, possibly larger than the antigen itself, associated with immunization they will not be willing to pay for or receive immunization. With fewer willing participants and a widening marginal benefit reaching a social optimum becomes more difficult for governments to achieve through subsidies.

Outside of government intervention through subsidies, non profit organizations can also move a society towards the socially optimal outcome by providing free immunizations to developing regions. Without the ability to afford the immunizations to begin with, developing societies will not be able to reach a quantity determined by private marginal benefits. By running immunization programs organizations are able to move privately under-immunized communities towards the social optimum.

==Race, ethnicity and immunization==
In the United States, race and ethnicity are strong determinants of utilization of preventive and therapeutic health services as well as health outcomes. Rates of infant mortality and most of the leading causes of overall mortality have been higher in African Americans than in European Americans. A recent analysis of mortality from influenza and pneumonia revealed that African Americans died of these causes at higher rates than European Americans in 1999–2018. Contributing to these racial disparities are lower rates of immunization against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, death rates have been higher in African Americans than European Americans and vaccination rates have lagged in African Americans during the roll-out. Among Hispanics immunization rates are lower than those in non-Hispanic whites.

<text>A teratoma is a tumor made up of several types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, teeth, or bone. Teratomata typically form in the tailbone (where it is known as a sacrococcygeal teratoma), ovary, or testicle. 
==Symptoms==
Symptoms may be minimal if the tumor is small. A testicular teratoma may present as a painless lump. Complications may include ovarian torsion, testicular torsion, or hydrops fetalis.
They are a type of germ cell tumor (a tumor that begins in the cells that give rise to sperm or eggs). They are divided into two types: mature and immature. Mature teratomas include dermoid cysts and are generally benign. Immature teratomas may be cancerous. Most ovarian teratomas are mature. In adults, testicular teratomas are generally cancerous. Definitive diagnosis is based on a tissue biopsy.
Treatment of coccyx, testicular, and ovarian teratomas is generally by surgery. Testicular and immature ovarian teratomas are also frequently treated with chemotherapy.
Teratomas occur in the coccyx in about one in 30,000 newborns, making them one of the most common tumors in this age group. Females are affected more often than males. Ovarian teratomas represent about a quarter of ovarian tumors and are typically noticed during middle age. Testicular teratomas represent almost half of testicular cancers. They can occur in both children and adults. The term comes from the Greek word for &quot;monster&quot; plus the &quot;-oma&quot; suffix used for tumors.

Teratomas can cause an autoimmune illness called Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. In this condition, the teratomas may contain B cells with NMDA-receptor specificities.

After teratoma removal surgery, a risk exists of regrowth in place, or in nearby organs.

==Types==

===Mature teratoma===
A mature teratoma is a grade 0 teratoma. They are highly variable in form and histology, and may be solid, cystic, or a combination of the two. A mature teratoma often contains several different types of tissue such as skin, muscle, and bone. Skin may surround a cyst and grow abundant hair . Mature teratomas generally are benign, with 0.17–2% of mature cystic teratomas becoming malignant.

=== Immature teratoma ===
Immature teratoma is the malignant counterpart of the mature teratoma and contains immature tissues which typically show primitive or embryonal neuroectodermal histopathology. Immature teratoma has one of the lowest rates of somatic mutation of any tumor type and results from one of five mechanisms of meiotic failure.

=== Gliomatosis peritoneii ===
Gliomatosis peritoneii, which presents as a deposition of mature glial cells in the peritoneum, is almost exclusively seen in conjunction with cases of ovarian teratoma. Through genetic studies of exome sequence, it was found that gliomatosis is genetically identical to the parent ovarian tumor and developed from cells that disseminate from the ovarian teratoma.

=== Dermoid cyst ===
A dermoid cyst is a mature cystic teratoma containing hair (sometimes very abundant) and other structures characteristic of normal skin and other tissues derived from the ectoderm. The term is most often applied to teratoma on the skull sutures and in the ovaries of females.

=== Fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; and fetiform teratoma===
Fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; and fetiform teratoma are rare forms of mature teratomas that include one or more components resembling a malformed fetus. Both forms may contain or appear to contain complete organ systems, even major body parts, such as a torso or limbs. Fetus &quot;in fetu &quot;differs from fetiform teratoma in having an apparent spine and bilateral symmetry.

Most authorities agree that fetiform teratomas are highly developed mature teratomas; the natural history of fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; is controversial. It has been noted that fetiform teratoma is reported more often (by gynecologists) in ovarian teratomas, and fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; is reported more often (by general surgeons) in retroperitoneal teratomas. Fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; has often been interpreted as a fetus growing within its twin. As such, this interpretation assumes a special complication of twinning, one of several grouped under the term parasitic twin. In many cases, the fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; is reported to occupy a fluid-filled cyst within a mature teratoma. Cysts within mature teratomas may have partially-developed organ systems: reports include cases of partial cranial bones, long bones and a rudimentary, beating heart.

Regardless of whether fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; and fetiform teratoma are one entity or two, they are distinct from and not to be confused with ectopic pregnancy.

=== Struma ovarii ===

A struma ovarii (also known as goitre of the ovary or ovarian goiter) is a rare form of mature teratoma that contains mostly thyroid tissue.

=== Epignathus ===
Epignathus is a rare teratoma originating in the oropharyngeal area that occurs &quot;in utero&quot;. It presents with a mass protruding from the mouth at birth. Untreated, breathing is impossible. An EXIT procedure is the recommended initial treatment.

==Fetal teratomas==
Teratomas may be found in babies, children, and adults. Teratomas of embryonal origin are most often found in babies at birth, in young children, and, since the advent of ultrasound imaging, in fetuses.

The most diagnosed fetal teratomas are sacrococcygeal teratoma (Altman types I, II, and III) and cervical (neck) teratoma. Because these teratomas project from the fetal body into the surrounding amniotic fluid, they can be seen during routine prenatal ultrasound exams. Teratomas within the fetal body are less easily seen with ultrasound; for these, MRI of the pregnant uterus is more informative.

===Complications===
Teratomas are not dangerous for the fetus unless either a mass effect occurs or a large amount of blood flows through the tumor (known as vascular steal). The mass effect frequently consists of obstruction of normal passage of fluids from surrounding organs. The vascular steal can place a strain on the growing heart of the fetus, even resulting in heart failure, thus must be monitored by fetal echocardiography.

==Pathophysiology==

Teratomas belong to a class of tumors known as nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. All tumors of this class are the result of abnormal development of pluripotent cells: germ cells and embryonal cells. Teratomas of embryonic origin are congenital; teratomas of germ cell origin may or may not be congenital. The kind of pluripotent cell appears to be unimportant, apart from constraining the location of the teratoma in the body.

Teratomas derived from germ cells occur in the testicle and ovaries. Teratomas derived from embryonic cells usually occur on the subject&#x27;s midline: in the brain, elsewhere in the skull, in the nose, in the tongue, under the tongue, and in the neck (cervical teratoma), mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and attached to the coccyx. Teratomas may also occur elsewhere: very rarely in solid organs (most notably the heart and liver) and hollow organs (such as the stomach and bladder), and more commonly on the skull sutures.

Teratoma rarely include more complicated body parts such as teeth, brain matter, eyes, or torso.

===Hypotheses of origin===
Concerning the origin of teratomas, numerous hypotheses exist. These hypotheses are not to be confused with the unrelated hypothesis that fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; (see below) is not a teratoma at all, but rather a parasitic twin.

==Diagnosis==
Teratomas are thought to originate &quot;in utero&quot;, so can be considered congenital tumors. Many teratomas are not diagnosed until much later in childhood or in adulthood. Large tumors are more likely to be diagnosed early on. Sacrococcygeal and cervical teratomas are often detected by prenatal ultrasound. Additional diagnostic methods may include prenatal magnetic resonance imaging. In rare circumstances, the tumor is so large that the fetus may be damaged or die. In the case of large sacrococcygeal teratomas, a significant portion of the fetus&#x27; blood flow is redirected toward the teratoma (a phenomenon called steal syndrome), causing heart failure, or hydrops, of the fetus. In certain cases, fetal surgery may be indicated.

Beyond the newborn period, symptoms of a teratoma depend on its location and organ of origin. Ovarian teratomas often present with abdominal or pelvic pain, caused by torsion of the ovary or irritation of its ligaments. A recently discovered condition where ovarian teratomas cause encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody (NMDAR) - often referred to as &quot;anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis&quot;, was identified as a serious complication. Patients develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability. Testicular teratomas present as a palpable mass in the testis; mediastinal teratomas often cause compression of the lungs or the airways and may present with chest pain and/or respiratory symptoms.

Some teratomas contain yolk sac elements, which secrete alpha-fetoprotein. Its detection may help to confirm the diagnosis and is often used as a marker for recurrence or treatment efficacy, but is rarely the method of initial diagnosis. (Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein is a useful screening test for other fetal conditions, including Down syndrome, spina bifida, and abdominal wall defects such as gastroschisis.)

===Classification===
Regardless of location in the body, a teratoma is classified according to a cancer staging system. This indicates whether chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be needed in addition to surgery. Teratomas commonly are classified using the Gonzalez-Crussi grading system: 0 or mature (benign); 1 or immature, probably benign; 2 or immature, possibly malignant (cancerous); and 3 or frankly malignant. If frankly malignant, the tumor is a cancer for which additional cancer staging applies.

Teratomas are also classified by their content; a solid teratoma contains only tissues (perhaps including more complex structures); a cystic teratoma contains only pockets of fluid or semifluid such as cerebrospinal fluid, sebum, or fat; a mixed teratoma contains both solid and cystic parts. Cystic teratomas usually are grade 0 and, conversely, grade 0 teratomas usually are cystic.

Grades 0, 1, and 2 pure teratomas have the potential to become malignant (grade 3), and malignant pure teratomas have the potential to metastasize. These rare forms of teratoma with malignant transformation may contain elements of somatic (not germ cell) malignancy such as leukemia, carcinoma, or sarcoma.
A teratoma may contain elements of other germ cell tumors, in which case it is not a pure teratoma, but rather is a mixed germ cell tumor and is malignant. In infants and young children, these elements usually are endodermal sinus tumor, followed by choriocarcinoma. Finally, a teratoma can be pure and not malignant yet highly aggressive; this is exemplified by growing teratoma syndrome, in which chemotherapy eliminates the malignant elements of a mixed tumor, leaving pure teratoma, which paradoxically begins to grow very rapidly.

==== Malignant transformation====
A &quot;benign&quot; grade 0 (mature) teratoma nonetheless has a risk of malignancy. Recurrence with malignant endodermal sinus tumor has been reported in cases of formerly benign mature teratoma, even in fetiform teratoma and fetus in fetu. Squamous cell carcinoma has been found in a mature cystic teratoma at the time of initial surgery. A grade 1 immature teratoma that appears to be benign (e.g., because AFP is not elevated) has a much higher risk of malignancy, and requires adequate follow-up.
This grade of teratoma also may be difficult to diagnose correctly. It can be confused with other small round cell neoplasms such as neuroblastoma, small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, Wilm&#x27;s tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

A teratoma with malignant transformation is a very rare form of teratoma that may contain elements of somatic malignant tumors such as leukemia, carcinoma, or sarcoma. Of 641 children with pure teratoma, nine developed TMT: five carcinoma, two glioma, and two embryonal carcinoma (here, these last are classified among germ cell tumors).

==== Extraspinal ependymoma ====
Extraspinal ependymoma, usually considered to be a glioma (a type of nongerm cell tumor), may be an unusual form of mature teratoma.

==Treatment==

===Surgery===
The treatment of choice is complete surgical removal (&quot;i.e.,&quot; complete resection). Teratomas are normally well-encapsulated and noninvasive of surrounding tissues, hence they are relatively easy to resect from surrounding tissues. Exceptions include teratomas in the brain, and very large, complex teratomas that have pushed into and become interlaced with adjacent muscles and other structures.

Prevention of recurrence does not require &quot;en bloc&quot; resection of surrounding tissues.

===Chemotherapy===
For malignant teratomas, usually, surgery is followed by chemotherapy.

Teratomas that are in surgically inaccessible locations, or are very complex, or are likely to be malignant (due to late discovery and/or treatment) sometimes are treated first with chemotherapy. 

===Follow-up===
Although often described as benign, a teratoma does have malignant potential. A UK study of 351 infants and children diagnosed with &quot;benign&quot; teratoma reported 227 with MT, 124 with IT. Five years after surgery, event-free survival was 92.2% and 85.9%, respectively, and overall survival was 99% and 95.1%. A similar study in Italy reported on 183 infants and children diagnosed with teratoma. At 10 years after surgery, event-free and overall survival were 90.4% and 98%, respectively.

Depending on which tissue(s) it contains, a teratoma may secrete a variety of chemicals with systemic effects. Some teratomas secrete the &quot;pregnancy hormone&quot; human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG), which can be used in clinical practice to monitor the successful treatment or relapse in patients with a known HCG-secreting teratoma. This hormone is not recommended as a diagnostic marker, because most teratomas do not secrete it. Some teratomas secrete thyroxine, in some cases to such a degree that it can lead to clinical hyperthyroidism in the patient. Of special concern is the secretion of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); under some circumstances, AFP can be used as a diagnostic marker specific for the presence of yolk sac cells within the teratoma. These cells can develop into a frankly malignant tumor known as yolk sac tumor or endodermal sinus tumor.

Adequate follow-up requires close observation, involving repeated physical examination, scanning (ultrasound, MRI, or CT), and measurement of AFP and/or βhCG.

==Epidemiology==

Embryonal teratomas most commonly occur in the sacrococcygeal region; sacrococcygeal teratoma is the single most common tumor found in newborn humans.

Of teratomas on the skull sutures, about 50% are found in or adjacent to the orbit. Limbal dermoid is a choristoma, not a teratoma.

Teratoma qualifies as a rare disease, but is not extremely rare. Sacrococcygeal teratoma alone is diagnosed at birth in one out of 40,000 humans. Given the current human population and birth rate, this equals five per day or 1800 per year. Add to that number sacrococcygeal teratomas diagnosed later in life, and teratomas in other locales, and the incidence approaches 10,000 new diagnoses of teratoma per year.

==Other animals==
Ovarian teratomas have been reported in mares,
mountain lions, and canines. Teratomas also occur, rarely, in other species.

== Use in stem cell research ==
Pluripotent stem cells including human induced pluripotent stem cells have a unique property of being able to generate teratomas when injected in rodents in the research laboratory. The roots of this observation has been attributed to Leroy Stevens of the Jackson Laboratory. In 1970, Stevens noticed that the cell populations that gave rise to teratomas were very similar to the cells of very early embryos. 
For this reason, the so-called &quot;teratoma assay&quot; is one of the gold-standard validation assays for pluripotent stem cells. Because differentiated human pluripotent stem cells are being developed as the basis for numerous regenerative medicine therapies, there is concern that residual undifferentiated stem cells could lead to teratoma formation in injected patients, and researchers are working to develop methods to address this concern.

New research has looked at utilizing the human teratoma in chimeric animal studies as a promising platform for modeling multi-lineage human development, pan-tissue functional genetic screening, and tissue engineering.

<text>Corcoracidae is a family of passerine birds known as the Australian mudnesters. The family has sometimes been called Struthideidae in the past; however, despite Struthideidae being an older name than Corcoracidae, the latter name takes precedence. It contains just two species in two genera, the white-winged chough (&quot;Corcorax melanorhamphos&quot;) and the apostlebird (&quot;Struthidea cinerea&quot;). Both are endemic to Australia.

==Distribution and habitat==
Both the Australian mudnesters are found in open habitat in eastern Australia, mostly open eucalypt woodlands and some forest that lacks a closed canopy. The apostlebird is more tolerant of arid habitats and is found in arid woodland and shrublands. Both species are tolerant of human modified habitats and will occupy farmlands and suburban areas, and even parks and gardens.

==Description==
The two mudnesters are medium-sized passerines, the apostlebird being smaller at around in length and the larger white-winged chough averaging . Their morphology is typical of ground feeding passerines, with long legs and short, rounded wings. The most noticeable differences between the two species are in the plumage (grey with brown wings and a black tail in the apostlebird, and black with white wing patches in the white-winged chough) and bill shape. The bill of the apostlebird is short and deep, not unlike that of a finch, whereas the bill of the white-winged chough is long and curved, not unlike that of its Old World namesakes, the choughs. The differences in the bills reflect the differences in feeding ecology, with the apostlebirds using theirs for sparrow-like picking whereas the white-winged chough uses its bill to flick leaf litter around.

==Behaviour==

In the field, the relationship between the two species is immediately apparent: both species are highly social, spending much of their time foraging through leaf litter with a very distinctive gait, calling to one another almost constantly. Both species respond to a human interloper by flying heavily to a nearby tree, where they wait for the disturbance to pass, often perching close together in twos and threes and allopreening. In picnic grounds and parks these birds may become accustomed to humans and become very tame.

The social groups of mudnesters are based around a dominant male and female. The number of birds in the group may vary from two to twenty birds, six birds being typical in the white-winged chough and seven to nine birds in the apostlebird. Both species are non migratory and defend a territory during the breeding season. The size of the territory during the breeding season is around 20 ha, after the breeding season when the chicks are fledged the group may range over a larger territory. On the death of one of the dominant breeders the groups break up, and the remaining dominant bird will take immatures from their group and find a lone bird to form a new group. The majority of recruits into any group after its establishment are youngsters from previous breeding seasons. These helpers are important in breeding success, so much so that white-winged choughs have been reported to kidnap nearly fledged chicks from other groups in order to increase the size of the kidnapping group.

As the common name of the family suggests, the nests are constructed out of mud. These bowl shaped nests take several days to construct, longer if supplies of mud dry up before the nest is finished. Nests are built opportunistically when rain causes muddy puddles, and may be reused if possible. Around three to five oval eggs are laid in each clutch. These eggs are incubated for around twenty days by all members of the group, and feeding and brooding duties are also shared within the group. This family has a very long period of fledgling care, with full independence from the parents and helpers taking up to 200 days.

Historically, the cracticines – currawongs, Australian magpie and butcherbirds – were seen as a separate family Cracticidae and, according to the 2018 Cements List, they still are. With their 1985 DNA study, Sibley and Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between the woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and placed them in a Cracticini clade, now the family Artamidae. The two species of peltops were once placed with the monarch flycatchers but are now placed here.

The cracticines have large, straight bills and mostly black, white or grey plumage. All are omnivorous to some degree: the butcherbirds mostly eat meat; Australian magpies usually forage through short grass looking for worms and other small creatures; and currawongs are true omnivores, taking fruit, grain, meat, insects, eggs and nestlings. The female constructs bulky nests from sticks, and both parents help incubate the eggs and raise the young thereafter.

The cracticines, despite their fairly plain, utilitarian appearance, are highly intelligent and have extraordinarily beautiful songs of great subtlety. Particularly noteworthy are the pied butcherbird, the pied currawong and the Australian magpie.

==Species of Cracticinae==
Five genera are recognised. The Australian magpie is classified in its own genus &quot;Gymnorhina&quot;. A 2013 molecular study has shown it to be the sister taxon to the black butcherbird (&quot;Melloria quoyi&quot;).

* Subfamily Cracticinae:
A fossil right scapula (MNZ S41061) found at the Manuherikia River in Otago, New Zealand and dating from the Early to Middle Miocene (Awamoan to Lillburnian, 19-16 million years ago) represents a member of the Cracticinae.

&quot;Kurrartapu johnnguyeni&quot; was described from a proximal tarsometatarsus recovered from the Riversleigh site in Queensland. It is early Miocene in age and is closer to &quot;Strepera/Cracticus&quot; than to &quot;Peltops&quot;. The bird was likely similar in size to the extant black butcherbird.

<text>Ole Wøhlers Olsen (born 1942) is Denmark&#x27;s ambassador to Algeria.

Olsen, a practicing Muslim, has been employed by Denmark&#x27;s Foreign Ministry since 1969. He has served in Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, Chile and Peru. In 1993, he completed a bicycle pilgrimage to Mecca.

The Danish government strongly supported the US-led invasion of Iraq, 2003, and in what was seen as recognition of the Scandinavian country&#x27;s support for the coalition, Olsen was appointed to the position as coordinator for one of the four US-led provisional authorities, that in Southern Iraq, stationed in Basra. The other three coordinators were Americans. Olsen has, however, criticized his US superiors in Baghdad for the lack of support for his reconstruction efforts, and for providing him with too little assistance, for instance on security back-up. He was suddenly replaced on July 28, three and a half months before his contract was due to end. He then returned to his former posting in Damascus as the Danish ambassador to Syria.

After Syria, he returned to Denmark, where he worked at the Danish Institute of International Studies for 1 year as a senior consultant. In 2006, he was sent on his latest posting; as the Danish ambassador to Algeria.

<doc id="284084" wikidata="Q1013179" url="?curid=284084" title="Sopot, Belgrade">
<text>Sopot (, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. According to the 2022 census results, the town has a population of 1,956 inhabitants while the municipality has 19,126 inhabitants.

== Location ==

Sopot is located on the slopes of the Kosmaj mountain, south of Belgrade. The mountain is some away from the town.

== History ==
The area has remains from Roman period. There is a masonry drinking fountain in Sopot, for which the Roman stones from some now disappeared structure were used.

The name of Sopot is derived from the old Slavic word for water spring (Serbian: &quot;izvor&quot;).(cf. Sopotnica). The word itself is onomatopoeic of the water sound flowing out of the spring. There are numerous springs and short creeks and streams in the area.

The village was mentioned in written records for the first time in 1818. In 1823, Serbian ruling prince Miloš Obrenović ordered for the &quot;meyhane&quot; to be built on the road which through Sopot was heading for Belgrade. The tavern was known as &quot;šindralija&quot; type, because it was roofed by &quot;šindra&quot;, or shingle. In 1830, huts for the travelers to Belgrade were built around it, expanding effectivelly the venue into the khan. It remains the oldest structure in the town and today hosts the Heritage Museum. There is a small park in front of it, through which flows one of many streams. In 1893, Sopot was declared a small town (&quot;varošica&quot;) by the royal decree.

In October 2019, the village of Ropočevo was officially abolished and its territory was annexed to the town of Sopot.

== Characteristics ==

Since 1972, an annual film festival &quot;Sofest&quot; has been held in Sopot. It is held in July, in the town&#x27;s Culture Hall.

At the town&#x27;s center are the Municipal Hall surrounded by the lush greenery, a fountain, and a monument to World War I combatant Đura Prokić. After the festival, there are several other monuments inspired by the motion pictures. Large number of weekend houses was built throughout the municipality since the 1970s, by the residents of Belgrade. The town is also a trade center, with well known farmers market, with local goods which includes peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables and fruits.

Hilly areas on Kosmaj are covered with forests of oak, beech and common hornbeam. Monasteries of Tresije, Pavlovac and Kasteljan (in ruins), are local tourist attractions. The stone church of Saint Peter and Paul is located in the village of Nemenikuće. In the churchyard there are six mulberry trees, estimated to originate from between 1600 and 1650. Being on the access road to Belgrade, Sopot had numerous restaurants and &quot;kafanas&quot;, and earned a moniker of a settlement with largest number of &quot;kafanas&quot; per capita.

Nowadays, the municipality has a large Primary and Economics high school. Sopot has a soccer club called the &quot;Wolves from Kosmaj&quot; and a basketball club bearing the same name.

==Settlements==
Aside from the town of Sopot, the following settlements comprise the municipality:

* Babe
* Guberevac
* Dučina

<doc id="284101" wikidata="Q2306431" url="?curid=284101" title="White House Press Secretary">
<text>The White House press secretary is a senior White House official whose primary responsibility is to act as spokesperson for the executive branch of the United States federal government, especially with regard to the president, senior aides and executives, as well as government policies.

The press secretary is responsible for collecting information about actions and events within the president&#x27;s administration and issues the administration&#x27;s reactions to developments around the world. The press secretary interacts with the media and the White House press corps on a daily basis, generally in a daily press briefing. The press secretary serves by the appointment and at the pleasure of the president of the United States; the office does not require the advice and consent of the United States Senate; however, because of the frequent briefings given to the global media, who in turn inform the public, the position is a prominent non-Cabinet post.

On January 20, 2025, Karoline Leavitt became the 36th White House press secretary.

== History ==

=== Early press relations ===
During the United States&#x27; early years, there was not a single designated staff person or office responsible for managing the relationship between the president and the growing number of journalists and media entities that were covering him. It was not until after President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s administration that Congress formally appropriated funds for a White House staff, which at first consisted merely of a secretary. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s White House staff officially numbered six people at a cost of $13,800, though he supplemented with personnel from the War Department. Fifty years later under the Coolidge administration, the staff had increased to just fewer than fifty people at a cost of nearly $100,000.

As presidents increasingly hired more staff, some showed a tendency to pick aides and confidantes who had backgrounds in the field of journalism. One of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s private secretaries, John G. Nicolay, had been an editor and owner of a newspaper in Illinois before he worked for the president in the White House. While the modern equivalent of a private or personal secretary to the president of the United States would be more narrowly concerned with the care and feeding of the president, the small size of the White House staff at that point meant that Nicolay interacted with the press occasionally in carrying out his duties. He was occasionally asked to verify stories or information that various members of the press had heard. Though the title and establishment of the roles and responsibilities of the press secretary job was still decades in the future, the small and growing White House staff was increasingly interacting with a growing number of professional journalists and mass media entities covering the president and the White House. Andrew Johnson was the first president to grant a formal interview request to a reporter, sitting down with Col. Alexander K. McClure from Pennsylvania. Although various presidents and reporters had participated in conversations or dialogues prior to Johnson, the exchanges had been less formal.

=== Cleveland and McKinley administrations ===
Prior to the 1880s and the presidency of Grover Cleveland, the relationship between the president, his administration, and the small but growing number of newspapers covering him was such that there was little need for a formal plan or designated spokesperson to manage it. The relationship between government and the press was not as inherently adversarial and arms length as in modern times. In fact, prior to the establishment of the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), some newspapers were awarded contracts to print government publications and often supported the president in exchange. For example, the &quot;Gazette of the United States&quot; won an early U.S. Treasury contract and was supportive of then-president Washington. In general, though coverage of the president could be harsh and opinionated, newspapers were to some degree extensions of the political party apparatus and subsequently not seen as entities requiring specific, sustained management by the White House or administration.

The media had changed significantly by 1884, when Grover Cleveland was elected as president of the United States. Between 1776 and 1884, the United States had quadrupled in size and increased in population from 2.5 million to 56 million. The number of newspaper publications in active circulation had increased from 37 to more than 1,200 dailies, in addition to the many new monthly magazines. The rapid growth in journalism as a booming industry resulted in an increase in reporters covering the activities of the president.

Grover Cleveland married 21-year-old Frances Folsom in 1886. The growing number of reporters and the increasing aggressiveness of their style of coverage led to frustrations when the president and his new bride were unable to rid themselves of reporters who followed them to their honeymoon in Deer Park, Maryland. President Cleveland relied on his private secretary, Daniel Lamont, who had once been an editor of the &quot;Albany Argus&quot;, to keep the reporters at bay. The controversy surrounding coverage of the trip resulted in a public debate about the balance between the right of the president and his family to privacy and the role of the press in covering the country&#x27;s most public figure. In an editorial, the &quot;New York World&quot; defended the right of the press to cover the president at all times: The idea of offending the bachelor sensitiveness of President Cleveland or the maidenly reserve of his bride has been far from anybody&#x27;s thought...We must insist that the President is public property; that it is perfectly legitimate to send correspondents and reporters to follow him when he goes on a journey, and to keep watch over him and his family.

=== White House press corps ===
At the end of the Cleveland administration, a new feature of press coverage of the White House materialized. William W. Price, a southern reporter, auditioned for a job at the &quot;Washington Evening Star&quot; by stationing himself at the White House to seek out stories. He interviewed guests coming and going from meetings or events with the president and ultimately reported a story in a piece carrying the headline &quot;At the White House&quot;. Competitor newspapers responded by sending their own reporters to cover the White House in a daily, sustained way and soon the White House had reporters dedicated to covering the &quot;White House beat&quot;. Some point to this as the early origins of a more formal White House Press Corps.

When President Cleveland was elected to a second, non-consecutive term in 1893, George B. Cortelyou, formally trained as a stenographer, was named confidential stenographer at the White House and later named executive clerk. Though he was not given the formal title of private secretary to the president until later and the term &quot;press secretary&quot; had not yet been conceived, Cortelyou was highly respected by the press and William McKinley&#x27;s biographer, Margaret Leach, called Cortelyou &quot;the first of the presidential press secretaries&quot;. President Cleveland&#x27;s successor, William McKinley, kept Cortelyou on during the transition and later formally named him private secretary to the president, though he had been informally doing the job for some time prior. Under McKinley, Cortelyou became notable for his popularity with journalists covering the White House. The correspondents relied on him for information and his tenure as private secretary was noteworthy for some of the same working traits modern press secretaries have become popular for, including providing information to reporters later in the evening if events had transpired in the afternoon, offering advance copies of remarks prepared for the president, and ensuring reporters received transcripts of unprepared remarks made by the president while traveling, which were recorded by a stenographer. Cortelyou also circulated noteworthy stories to the president and other staffers (by this point the White House staff numbered approximately 18), which is similar to the exhaustive news summaries formally distributed to the White House staff in the modern era. The nascent press corps&#x27; appreciation for Cortelyou&#x27;s responsiveness is similar to how a modern White House press secretary&#x27;s responsiveness to the press corps can shape their positive or negative view of him or her.

=== Working space in the White House for the press corps ===
The White House &quot;beat&quot; concept that had been started during the Cleveland administration by reporter William Price was continued during the McKinley administration. Around the time of the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, the reporters covering the White House were invited into the mansion itself and provided with space to write, conduct interviews, and generally cover the White House. Now reporting from inside the White House, the reporters used their new location to interview guests entering or leaving the White House or confirm pieces of information from the president&#x27;s secretaries as they passed through in the course of their duties. Reporters working in the White House did, however, honor an unspoken rule and refrain from asking the president himself a question if he happened to walk through their working area.

The long-term presence of the White House Press Corps in the White House was cemented by Theodore Roosevelt, who asked that planners include permanent space for the press corps in the executive office building now called the West Wing, which he had ordered built in the early 1900s. It is the West Wing that ultimately housed the Office of the Press Secretary and the now-famous James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, which was renovated by the George W. Bush administration in 2007.

=== Woodrow Wilson administration ===
When Woodrow Wilson was elected governor of New Jersey in 1910, he asked Joseph P. Tumulty to serve as his private secretary. When he was elected president two years later, he brought Tumulty with him to the White House, where Tumulty served as private secretary to the president. As private secretary, Tumulty dealt extensively with the press. At the outset of the administration, Tumulty convinced Wilson, who was known for his distaste of the press, to hold news conferences on a regularized schedule, sometimes as much as twice every week. During the first such news conference, over one hundred reporters crowded into Wilson&#x27;s office to ask him questions. Wilson often requested that reporters not publish answers given in these settings and on one occasion threatened to cancel the news conferences when a reporter revealed comments he had given regarding Mexico. The press conferences were later discontinued after the sinking of British liner &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and despite attempts to revive them during his second term were held only sporadically during Wilson&#x27;s final years in office.

Joseph Tumulty also put into place a more regular schedule of briefing the press. He gave daily briefings to the press in the morning, which were attended by as many as thirty reporters. By formalizing the press briefing process, Tumulty laid the groundwork for what would later be called the White House Press Briefing. Tumulty also worked to clarify embargo rules for the press, ordering that the exact time a press embargo was lifted be noted on the confidential information that was being released.

=== Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover administrations ===
Despite being nicknamed &quot;Silent Cal&quot;, many reporters covering the White House found President Calvin Coolidge to be fairly accessible once he took office in 1923 following the death of President Warren G. Harding. During his over five years in office, Coolidge held approximately 520 press conferences, which averaged out to nearly 8 per month. The term &quot;White House spokesman&quot; was used extensively for the first time during the Coolidge administration, as press conference rules mandated that reporters could attribute quotes or statements only to a &quot;White House spokesman&quot; and not directly to the president himself. Former Associated Press editor W. Dale Nelson suggests that this practice was a precursor to the more modern use of &quot;senior administration official&quot; offering statements or quotes not directly attributable to a specific person, which was used frequently by Henry Kissinger during the Nixon administration.

When Herbert Hoover assumed the presidency in 1929, he brought his longtime aide George E. Akerson to Washington with him as his private secretary. Akerson did not have the formal title of &quot;press secretary&quot;, but was the designated person to speak on behalf of President Hoover. Hoover asked the White House Correspondents Association to form a committee to discuss matters pertaining to coverage of the White House and formalized news conferences, dividing presidential news into three different categories:

* Announcements directly attributable to the president of the United States,
* Statements attributable to official sources, but not to the president himself, and
* Background information for the reporter&#x27;s knowledge but not specifically attributable to the president nor the White House

George Akerson continued the tradition of meeting daily with reporters, and though usually of jovial temperament, was not known for the precision that was the hallmark of some of his predecessors, such as Cortelyou. On one occasion, he incorrectly stated that sitting Supreme Court justice Harlan Stone had been elevated to be chief justice, only to have to issue a statement later that the actual nominee was Charles Evans Hughes. Akerson also struggled at times with his role in a growing White House staff. Akerson was one of three secretaries to the president, and some speculated that Hoover&#x27;s closeness to his other secretary, Lawrence Richey, a former detective and Secret Service agent, made it difficult for Akerson to obtain the kind of information he needed to effectively do his job. As poor coverage made President Hoover appear detached and out of touch amidst a worsening depression, Richey and Akerson disagreed about the most effective press strategy, with Akerson promoting the idea that Hoover should leverage the increasingly influential platform of radio, and Richey arguing that the radio strategy was not worthy of the presidency. Akerson resigned not long thereafter, and Theodore Joslin, a former reporter, was named as the new secretary. Relations between the Hoover administration and the press continued to decline.

=== Roosevelt administration, Steve Early, and the first &quot;White House press secretary&quot; ===
During the administration of presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, journalist Stephen Early became the first White House secretary charged only with press responsibilities. The manner in which Early approached his portfolio and increasingly high-profile nature of the job have led many to state that Early is the first true White House press secretary, both in function and in formal title. Prior to joining the Roosevelt campaign and administration Early had served as an editor to the military paper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; and also as a reporter for the Associated Press. When Roosevelt was nominated on James Cox&#x27;s ticket as the vice presidential nominee in 1920, he asked Early to serve as an advance representative. As an advance representative, Early traveled ahead of the campaign, arranged for logistics and attempted to promote positive coverage for the candidates.

When President Roosevelt won the presidency in 1932, he chose Early to be his secretary responsible for handling the press, or as the role was becoming known, &quot;the press secretary&quot;. After accepting the job, Early laid out for Roosevelt his vision of how the role should be conducted. He requested having unfettered access to the president, having his quotes and statements directly attributable to him as press secretary, and offering as much factual information to the press as it became available. He also convinced Roosevelt to agree to twice-weekly presidential press conferences, with the timing of each tailored to the different deadline schedules of the White House Press Corps. Early also made himself available to the press corps as often as he could, and though he was not known for a lighthearted or amiable demeanor, he earned a reputation for responsiveness and openness, even having his own telephone number listed unlike some of those who held the job after him.

Despite the unpopularity of press conferences by the end of the Hoover administration, Roosevelt continued the tradition. He did away with written questions submitted in advance and mandated that nothing he said in press conferences could be attributed to him or the White House, but was instead intended for reporters&#x27; general background information. Many reporters found this helpful as it allowed the president to be forthright and candid in his assessments and answers their questions. Unlike some of his predecessors who filled the role, Early routinely prepared Roosevelt for press conferences, bringing the president&#x27;s attention to issues that might come up, suggesting the appropriate answers, and even planting questions or issues with certain reporters. Press conferences also began a tradition where the senior wire reporter concludes the session by stating, &quot;Thank you, Mr. President&quot;, signaling that the time for questioning is over, a tradition that continues today. Roosevelt held well over 300 press conferences during his first term.

Though some reporters were unsatisfied with the amount of real news or new information they were getting from the press conferences, the Roosevelt administration under Early&#x27;s leadership was considered by many to be effective at managing the White House&#x27;s relationship with the press. During the administration, &quot;U.S. News&quot; reported that &quot;The machinery for getting and giving the news runs about as smoothly as could be wished from either side.&quot;

The Roosevelt White House was also marked by a significant increase in the number of White House staff supporting the president and bureaucracy in general, largely as a result of increased New Deal funding. Early was criticized at times for attempting to closely manage press officers at various department and agencies across the government, and gave out a number of such jobs to journalists who he knew, instead of party loyalists who had traditionally received such appointments. A congressional investigation several years later revealed that across government, fewer than 150 employees were engaged in public relations along with an additional 14 part-time workers. This is a significant increase given that White House staff numbered at 11 in total when Roosevelt took office.

Early was involved in Roosevelt taking advantage of the radio medium through his fireside chats, an idea some say he got from George Akerson who had unsuccessfully tried to convince President Hoover to do something similar. Early also came under fire for the rules surrounding African American journalists not being allowed to attend presidential press conferences. Some have said that Early used enforcement of the standing rule, which had been to only allow regular Washington journalists to attend the press conferences, to deny press conference access to black reporters. Since many if not most black publications at the time were weeklies, they were restricted as a result of the rules. When African American reporters from daily publications requested access to the conferences, Early reportedly told them to seek accreditation from Capitol Hill press officers, which was another sometimes insurmountable challenge. African American reporters did not gain formal approval to attend White House news conferences until 1944.

Early&#x27;s tenure as press secretary was also marked by stringent restrictions on photographers, largely aimed at hiding the severity of FDR&#x27;s polio and worsening immobility. Photographers were not permitted to be closer than of FDR, or in larger events.

As a result of the increasingly high-profile nature of the job and Early&#x27;s sole responsibility of managing the White House press operations, it was during the Roosevelt administration that Early and the position he held began to be formally referred to as the press secretary. As a result, many point to Steve Early as the first White House press secretary.

=== Eisenhower administration, James Hagerty, press secretary role evolves ===
As a candidate for president, Dwight D. Eisenhower tapped James Hagerty, a former reporter for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, to be his press secretary. Hagerty had previously been press secretary for New York governor Thomas E. Dewey during his two tries for the presidency. After he won election, Eisenhower appointed Hagerty to be White House press secretary.

Hagerty&#x27;s experience as a journalist helped him perform his role more effectively: &quot;Having spent years as a reporter on the other side of the news barrier, he was not blinded to the reporter&#x27;s dependence on deadlines, transmission facilities, prompt texts of speeches and statements and the frequent necessity of having to ask seemingly irrelevant and inconsequential questions&quot;, wrote John McQuiston in the &quot;New York Times&quot;&quot;.

At Hagerty&#x27;s first meeting with White House reporters on January 21, 1953, he laid down ground rules that are still largely a model for how the press secretary operates. He said:

: I would like to say to you fellows that I am not going to play any favorites, and I&#x27;m not going to give out any exclusive stories about the president or the White House.

: When I say to you, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; I mean I don&#x27;t know. When I say, &#x27;No comment,&#x27; it means I&#x27;m not talking, but not necessarily any more than that.

: Aside from that, I&#x27;m here to help you get the news. I am also here to work for one man, who happens to be the president. And I will do that to the best of my ability.

The practice of regularly scheduled presidential news conference was instituted during the Eisenhower administration. Hagerty abolished the longstanding rule that the president could not be directly quoted without permission—for the first time, everything that the president said at a press conference could be printed verbatim.

In 1955, during the Eisenhower administration, newsreel and television cameras were allowed in presidential news conferences for the first time.

When President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in Denver in September 1955, and underwent abdominal surgery the following year, Hagerty brought news to the nation in a calm and professional manner. &quot;His performances in both crises won him more respect from newsmen than any presidential press secretary in memory&quot;, said a &quot;New York Times&quot; writer.

Hagerty remained press secretary for eight years, still the record for longest time served in that position. Eisenhower grew to trust Hagerty to such a degree that the role of press secretary was elevated to that of a senior advisor to the president.

== Evaluations ==
Michael J. Towle weighs four factors determining the success and popularity of all seven press secretaries 1953 to 1980. Experts generally agree that James C. Hagerty, under Eisenhower, set the standard by which later press secretaries are judged. Under Carter, Jody Powell followed the Hagerty model, and was also judged successful. For Towle the first factor is the importance and centrality of the press secretary to the administration. Insiders who participate in high-level decision-making do better at explaining policy; the press has less confidence in outsiders, Towle concludes. The second factor is how tightly the office is controlled by the president. The media pays more attention to secretaries who are allowed to elaborate, and expound on the president&#x27;s thoughts, and answer probing questions. Third, does the president signal confidence in the press secretary. Fourth is the respect the secretary has won from the press in terms of knowledge, credibility, clarity, promptness and ability to provide information on a wide range of policies.

Towle concludes that history had judged Hagerty and Salinger as successful. Lyndon Johnson confided in Salinger but distrusted the media and hobbled his next three press secretaries. Nixon throughout his career saw the press as the enemy, and the media responded in hostile fashion, leaving the young inexperienced Ronald Ziegler with a hopeless challenge. President Ford&#x27;s first secretary was Jerald F. terHorst – he resigned in protest when Ford pardoned Nixon. Next came Ronald Nessen, who quickly acquired a reputation as inept, uninformed or noncredible, especially on foreign affairs. At the opposite extreme, the successful Jody Powell had been a close advisor to Carter for years, and could explain clearly how the president reasoned about issues. Carter said he &quot;probably knows me better than anyone except my wife.&quot;

== Responsibilities ==
The press secretary is responsible for collecting information about actions and events within the president&#x27;s administration and around the world, and interacting with the media, generally in a daily press briefing. The information includes items such as a summary of the president&#x27;s schedule for the day, whom the president has seen, or had communication with and the official position of the administration on the news of the day.

The press secretary traditionally also fields questions from the White House press corps in briefings and press conferences, which are generally televised, and &quot;press gaggles&quot;, which are on-the-record briefings without video recording, although transcripts are usually made available.

The position has often been filled by individuals from news media backgrounds:

* Roosevelt administration – Stephen Early, a reporter for United Press International and correspondent for the Associated Press
* Truman administration – Jonathan W. Daniels, a newspaper editor who was in the Franklin Roosevelt administration in multiple agencies and on various boards just prior to becoming press secretary; Charlie Ross, a journalist who received the Pulitzer Prize in 1932; Early; Joseph Short, a newspaper editor; and Roger Tubby, a reporter and editor turned Democratic National Committee spokesman before becoming White House press secretary
* Eisenhower administration – James Hagerty, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;
* Kennedy administration – Pierre Salinger, a reporter and editor for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;
* Johnson administration – appointed George Christian, a reporter for International News Service and PBS commentator Bill Moyers
* Ford administration – appointed Jerald terHorst, a newspaper veteran; and Ron Nessen, an NBC News correspondent
* Reagan administration – Larry Speakes, a newspaper editor; and Marlin Fitzwater, a newspaper editor
* George H. W. Bush administration – Marlin Fitzwater
* George W. Bush administration – Tony Snow, a veteran journalist and Fox News Channel anchor
* Obama administration – Jay Carney, &quot;Time&quot; journalist.
* Trump administration – Kayleigh McEnany, Fox News Channel political commentator.
* Biden administration – Jen Psaki, CNN political commentator.

<text>The Starr Report, officially the Referral from Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr in Conformity with the Requirement of Title 28, United States Code, Section 595(c), is a United States federal government report by Independent Counsel Ken Starr concerning his investigation of President Bill Clinton. Delivered to the United States Congress on September 9, 1998, the allegations in the report led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton&#x27;s law license. 

==Background==
Initially chosen as Independent Counsel in 1994, and charged with investigating Bill and Hillary Clinton&#x27;s pre-presidency financial dealings with the Whitewater Land Company, Ken Starr, with the approval of Attorney General Janet Reno, conducted a wide-ranging investigation of alleged abuses including the firing of White House travel agents, the alleged misuse of FBI files, and Clinton&#x27;s conduct while he was a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former Arkansas state government employee, Paula Jones. In the course of the investigation, Linda Tripp provided Starr with taped phone conversations in which Monica Lewinsky, a former White House Intern, discussed having oral sex with the president. Clinton gave a sworn deposition in the Jones case on January 17, 1998, during which he denied having a &quot;sexual relationship&quot;, &quot;sexual affair&quot; or &quot;sexual relations&quot; with Lewinsky. He also denied that he was ever alone with her. Seven months later, on August 17, Clinton faced a federal grand jury, convened by Ken Starr, to consider whether the president committed perjury in his January deposition, or otherwise obstructed justice, in the Jones case. A much-quoted statement from the deposition shows Clinton questioning the precise use of the word &quot;is&quot;, saying, &quot;It depends on what the meaning of the word &#x27;is&#x27; is. If the—if he—if &#x27;is&#x27; means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement&quot;. Clinton contended that his January statement that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing going on between us&quot; had been truthful because he had no ongoing relationship with Lewinsky at the time he was questioned. He also stated that oral sex was not, in his opinion, &quot;sexual relations&quot; within the meaning of that term as adopted in the Jones case (i.e. vaginal intercourse).

The Office of the Independent Counsel concluded its four-year-long investigation of the president soon after Clinton&#x27;s grand jury testimony, and on September 9, 1998, delivered its report to the House Judiciary Committee. Republican House leaders argued for the report&#x27;s immediate release via the internet, while Democrats appealed for delay in order to allow the White House time to prepare a response. After two days of debate, on September 11, the House voted 363–63 to release the report to the public. When the report, a 453-page document summarizing the evidence against the president, was uploaded to the internet, it became a sensation, with 20 million people (12% of adult Americans) accessing the document at least once. &quot;It&#x27;s probably the single highest number of people who have ever used the computer to access a single document,&quot; David Webber of the Frank Luntz polling company told CNN.

==Summary==
The long-awaited report cited 11 possible grounds for impeachment in four categories: perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of power. These allegations all arose from President Clinton&#x27;s affair with Monica Lewinsky.

In the report&#x27;s introduction, Starr asserted that Clinton had lied under oath during a sworn deposition on January 17, 1998, while he was a &quot;defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit&quot; and &quot;to a grand jury.&quot; He additionally alleged that Clinton had &quot;attempted to influence the testimony of a grand jury witness who had direct knowledge of facts that would reveal the falsity of his deposition testimony; attempted to obstruct justice by facilitating a witness&#x27; plan to refuse to comply with a subpoena; attempted to obstruct justice by encouraging a witness to file an affidavit that the president knew would be false ... ; lied to potential grand jury witnesses, knowing that then they would repeat those lies before the grand jury; and engaged in a pattern on conduct that was inconsistent with his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.&quot;

Starr included a detailed timeline of Lewinsky&#x27;s various sexual encounters with Clinton during her White House internship. He concluded the report with a section entitled &quot;Grounds,&quot; where he provided supporting evidence to each of the 11 grounds for potential impeachment of Clinton—including physical evidence such as the DNA test results of a semen stain on a dress owned by Lewinsky which matched Clinton&#x27;s blood sample. Starr also alleged that Clinton had conversations with witnesses during his investigation which he ascribed as &quot;witness-tampering and obstruction of justice by hiding evidence and giving misleading accounts to lawyers for Paula Jones.&quot;

==Stated possible grounds for impeachment==
Specifically, Starr reported:


==Response to report==
At the time it was released, the report was criticized for making accusations about exactly what Clinton did. The report claimed &quot;the details are crucial to an informed evaluation of the testimony, the credibility of witnesses, and the reliability of other evidence. Many of the details reveal highly personal information; many are sexually explicit. This is unfortunate, but it is essential.&quot; Because Starr&#x27;s office allegedly leaked portions to press about sexual details that were mentioned in his report, he was criticized for using the scandal as a political maneuver and was charged for violating legal ethics by presenting information irrelevant to an investigation as evidence of legal wrongdoing. Also, it is unclear whether Starr had the legal authority to ask Clinton questions about his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, as the OIC was convened solely to investigate Whitewater and Paula Jones&#x27; claim that Clinton sexually harassed her. Questioning about a sexual relationship void of assault appears to be both irrelevant under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) as a whole and under Rule 413, which allows questioning about separate allegations of sexual assault (which was never asserted about Lewinsky&#x27;s relationship with Clinton).

The report was also criticized for exaggerating what the legal definition of perjury is, accusing Clinton of committing perjury after only one witness claimed he did so and saying that Clinton lied when he said he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky in terms described by Paula Jones&#x27; attorneys. Two of the three parts of the definition of &quot;sexual relations&quot; described by Jones&#x27; attorneys during her lawsuit had been ruled out by presiding Judge Susan Webber Wright as &quot;too broad&quot; and legally unacceptable.

The report alleged that Clinton considered oral sex to be a form of sexual relations and that the relationship between him and Lewinsky lasted longer than the date he described, but presented nothing relevant to back its claims. The report also claimed that Clinton falsely denied under oath ever meeting with Lewinsky alone at times, despite the fact that Clinton did admit to this when he testified, and that Clinton obstructed justice by concealing gifts he gave to Lewinsky and destroying an intimate note that was left in a book he claimed Lewinsky gave him when she visited the White House on January 4, 1998. Lewinsky&#x27;s testimony that Clinton concealed gifts was contradicted by both Clinton&#x27;s testimony and that of his personal secretary Betty Currie, who each said that it was Lewinsky who asked him for some gifts and that he tended to give a number of his staff gifts as an act of courtesy. Betty Currie also produced some of the gifts Clinton gave to Lewinsky before the grand jury. Clinton also denied ever seeing such an intimate note and the Secret Service WAVES records showed Lewinsky did not visit the White House on any given date in 1998. Starr also presented nothing credible to back his claim that Clinton obstructed justice by asking Lewinsky to file an affidavit denying there was ever a relationship between the two or that both Lewinsky and Clinton denied what had truly happened during the relationship under oath. The report also alleged Clinton&#x27;s job offer to Lewinsky was an attempt to keep her from admitting the relationship to the public and thus obstruct justice, but had nothing relevant to back this claim either.

Starr also accused Clinton of denying under oath that he ever had a conversation with Vernon Jordan about Lewinsky&#x27;s involvement in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Clinton, however, was never asked this when he testified during the Jones case. Starr also accused Clinton of witness tampering by influencing Currie to testify in favor of him. Currie, however, was not called as a witness when stated what she saw had happened during the relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky and it was demonstrated that Lewinsky was a friend of Currie&#x27;s who had exchanged some of the gifts Clinton gave Lewinsky during a visit. While Starr did acknowledge that Currie did visit Lewinsky&#x27;s apartment and exchanged the gifts with her, he also claimed that the fact that Currie drove to Lewinsky&#x27;s apartment proved Lewinsky&#x27;s testimony that Clinton concealed the gifts was correct and Currie&#x27;s and Clinton&#x27;s were both false. This claim about was denounced as without any basis or logic.

Starr also claimed that Clinton simultaneously delayed testimony for seven months and lied to potential grand jury witnesses by publicly denying the relationship, and thus committed a criminal felony by refusing to testify. When Clinton made his claim about his relationship with Lewinsky to the public, however, he was not under oath and thus it legally was not a felony. There was also no evidence that Clinton committed witness tampering by privately denying the relationship to these witnesses and asking them to testify in his favor.

Starr also argued that Clinton abused power by: denying the relationship with Lewinsky ever occurred; using executive privilege to both pursue an appeal against the case without Starr&#x27;s knowledge; using executive privilege to cover up the relationship; delaying his grand jury testimony until August, and by getting the Secret Service to agree to assist in covering up the relationship in an acquiescing matter. However, a letter was discovered that showed Clinton&#x27;s legal team had informed Starr before the appeals took place. The report was also misleading when it reflected the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling that the President could not use the Secret Service to assist in whatever they wanted help with. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who wrote the majority opinion, had also stated that any case with merit, the prospect of an appeal would be granted. When Clinton pursued the appeal before the DC District Court, the court&#x27;s Chief Justice Norma Holloway Johnson acknowledged that Clinton was cooperating with Starr and did not use executive privilege to cover up the relationship. Abuse of power had also been defined in &quot;The Federalist&quot; Papers as &quot;corrupt use of the office for personal gain or some other improper purpose,&quot; which was not demonstrated in this case.

===Partial retraction===

In January 2020, while testifying as a defense lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump during his Senate impeachment trial, Starr himself would retract some of the allegations he made in the report. &quot;Slate&quot; journalist Jeremy Stahl pointed out that as he was urging the Senate not to remove Trump as president, Starr contradicted various arguments he used in 1998 to justify Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. In defending Trump, Starr also claimed he was wrong to have called for impeachment against Clinton for abuse of executive privilege and efforts to obstruct Congress and also stated that the House Judiciary Committee was right in 1998 to have rejected one of the planks for impeachment he had advocated for. He also invoked a 1999 Hofstra Law Review article by Yale law professor Akhil Amar, who argued that the Clinton impeachment proved just how impeachment and removal causes &quot;grave disruption&quot; to a national election.

<doc id="284143" wikidata="Q959587" url="?curid=284143" title="Blue Amberol Records">
<text>Blue Amberol Records was the trademark name for cylinder records manufactured by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. in the US from 1912 to 1929. They replaced the 4-minute black wax Amberol cylinders introduced in 1908, which had replaced the 2-minute wax cylinders that had been the standard format since the late 1880s. Blue Amberols can play for as long as 4 minutes and 45 seconds and have a surface layer of the &quot;indestructible&quot; plastic celluloid, which Edison tinted a trademark blue color. Edison brand phonographs designed to play Amberol cylinders were named Amberolas.
==History==

===Edison wax Amberols===
The four-minute Amberol cylinder made its debut in 1908. Amberols were made of a fragile, black, wax-like compound which was harder than the original 1902 black wax. This Amberol wax was also used for 2-minute standard records from 1908 until the Blue Amberol appeared in 1912. The introduction of the Amberol started a resurgence of interest in cylinder records, but problems soon became apparent. Amberols crack rather easily and could break during playback. Amberols often shattered when they broke, unlike some kinds of 2-minute wax cylinders that would simply crack into a few pieces. Another problem was that wax Amberols wore out too quickly. Some Amberols mistracked or played with a wavering pitch due to uneven shrinkage during the manufacturing process.

===Edison Blue Amberols===

By 1912, the shortcomings of the wax Amberol were obvious. Edison, who did not want to pay royalties to Thomas B. Lambert for his celluloid cylinder patent, eventually bought it and changed production over to a thin but tough blue-tinted celluloid reinforced with a plaster of Paris core. The introduction of these &quot;Blue Amberols&quot; helped to hike cylinder sales. The early Blue Amberol releases offered excellent audio quality for their era — better, in fact, than later issues, because from January 1915 onward Thomas A. Edison, Inc., which had been concentrating its efforts on improving the quality of Diamond Disc phonograph records, began to release cylinders which were acoustically dubbed from Diamond Discs. The dubbing technique used was non-electronic (the disc phonograph horn played into the cylinder recording horn) until December 1927, when electronic dubbing was introduced. This resulted in a somewhat hollow &quot;dead&quot; sound on the cylinders compared to the original discs. On many dubbed cylinders, when the cylinder&#x27;s own 160 rpm surface noise is low enough, 80 rpm disc surface noise can be heard starting up shortly before the music begins.

Beyond the main popular and sacred music series, which began with record number 1501 in 1912 and ended with record number 5719 in 1929, Edison offered a special line of prestigious Concert Blue Amberols of opera arias, light classical pieces, and other &quot;cultured&quot; music performed by &quot;name&quot; artists, later supplanted by the distinctively tinted Royal Purple Amberol cylinders. A set of special wax Amberols or Blue Amberols identified by the letters A through H, rather than the more usual numbers, were given away with 4-minute conversion kits sold for updating some earlier 2-minute phonographs. There were Blue Amberol instructional records to accompany the Edison School Phonograph, ICS language courses, Blue Amberols for Morse code training, Blue Amberols for the French and German markets, special 2-minute Blue Amberols for the rural Mexican market, and 6-inch-long (15 cm) dictation instruction cylinders for the Ediphone that were essentially long Blue Amberols and remained in production for many years after the demise of the cylinder format as an entertainment medium.

==Technical==
Edison Blue Amberols are made of celluloid on a molded plaster core. The celluloid surface is able to withstand hundreds of playings with only a moderate increase in surface noise if played on a well-maintained machine with a stylus in good condition.

Blue Amberols have a maximum playing time of about 4 minutes and 45 seconds and play at the standard post-1902 cylinder speed of 160 rpm. Like the preceding black wax Amberols, they provide twice the playing time of 2-minute cylinders by using a finer groove with a pitch of 200 lines per inch instead of 100. They cannot be played on older machines set up to play only the earlier standard 2 minute cylinders, as both wax and celluloid Amberols require a smaller stylus tip to fit the finer groove and the worm-gear which moves the stylus over the surface of the cylinder must turn at a different rate. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. sold kits with gear assemblies and reproducers that could be installed by the owner of an older Edison machine so that both standard and 4-minute records could be played. The Edison company also marketed new models capable of playing both. With these combination machines the operator needed to adjust a knob or lever that shifted gears and make sure the correct reproducing stylus was in position when switching from one record type to the other.

Internal horn Edison phonographs designed to play 4-minute cylinders were called Amberolas. The earliest Amberola model, the 1909 Amberola IA, was equipped with selectable 2 and 4-minute gearing, and after initially being sent out fitted with an unmarked Model &quot;L&quot; reproducer with a flattened fishtail weight that was recalled almost immediately as being &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, was refitted with the Model &quot;M&quot; reproducer with flip-over 2 and 4-minute sapphire styli for playing wax cylinders. There is at least one known example of an early Model M reproducer also fitted with a flattened fishtail weight.

Upon the introduction of Blue Amberols in 1912, the M reproducer was supplanted by the Diamond A reproducer, which was designed for playing only celluloid cylinders. Its small-tipped conical diamond stylus and increased stylus pressure would seriously damage wax cylinders. External horn Edison phonographs were available with the Diamond B reproducer. Several other Amberola models less expensive than the IA (and later the 4-minute-only IB and III) were available, such as the V, VI, and X.

After an Edison factory fire in December 1914, the Amberola line was simplified in both mechanical and cabinet design, resulting in the 4-minute-only Amberola 30, 50, and 75, each model number indicating the initial retail price in dollars. They were equipped with the Diamond C reproducer. The 4-minute-only external horn Opera (later renamed Concert) model of 1911-1912, which used the same mechanism as the IB and III, was initially fitted with the Model L reproducer, which had an elliptical sapphire stylus for playing wax Amberols, but after the introduction of Blue Amberols it shipped with the Diamond A reproducer.

==Archival storage of cylinders==

The &quot;Amberol&quot; plastic is on a plaster of Paris core. This core is proving to be problematic for the long-term survival of Blue Amberol Records, as the plaster often tends to expand over the decades, especially if exposed to moisture or kept in humid conditions. In moderate cases, swollen plaster can make the record not fit properly on the phonograph mandrel (this can be fairly easily remedied by gently reaming out the plaster to restore the correct inner diameter) or can warp the cylinder out of round, making it not play properly. In worse cases, the expanding plaster will crack or split the plastic playing surface, rendering the record unusable. Freezing causes any moisture in the plaster to expand but makes the celluloid contract, a combination which can cause the celluloid to split lengthwise very abruptly.

The Blue Amberol plastic is nitrocellulose and therefore flammable. Being an organic plastic, celluloid is subject to chemical decomposition, but acute deterioration, as seen in nitrate film reels, has so far rarely if ever been observed in Blue Amberols or other (e.g., Lambert, Albany Indestructible, and US Everlasting) celluloid cylinders.

<doc id="284163" wikidata="Q42410" url="?curid=284163" title="Evo Morales">
<text>Juan Evo Morales Ayma (; born 26 October 1959) is a Bolivian politician, trade union organizer, and former cocalero activist who served as the 65th president of Bolivia from 2006 to 2019. Widely regarded as the country&#x27;s first president to come from its indigenous population, his administration worked towards the implementation of left-wing policies, focusing on the legal protections and socioeconomic conditions of Bolivia&#x27;s previously marginalized indigenous population and combating the political influence of the United States and resource-extracting multinational corporations. Ideologically a socialist, he led the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party from 1998 to 2024.
Born to an Aymara family of subsistence farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education and mandatory military service before moving to the Chapare Province in 1978. Growing coca and becoming a trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the &quot;campesino&quot; (&quot;rural laborers&quot;) union. In that capacity, he campaigned against joint U.S.–Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca as part of the War on Drugs, denouncing these as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government direct action protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, was elected to Congress in 1997 and became leader of MAS in 1998. Coupled with populist rhetoric, he campaigned on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and more equal redistribution of money from Bolivian gas extraction. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba Water War and gas conflict. In 2002, he was expelled from Congress for encouraging anti-government protesters, although he came second in that year&#x27;s presidential election.
Once elected president in 2005, Morales increased taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending and emphasized projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, and racial and gender discrimination. Vocally criticizing neoliberalism, Morales&#x27; government moved Bolivia towards a mixed economy, reduced its dependence on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and oversaw strong economic growth. Scaling back United States influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American pink tide, especially Hugo Chávez&#x27;s Venezuela and Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, and signed Bolivia into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. His administration opposed the autonomist demands of Bolivia&#x27;s eastern provinces, won a 2008 recall referendum, and instituted a new constitution that established Bolivia as a plurinational state. Re-elected in 2009 and 2014, he oversaw Bolivia&#x27;s admission to the Bank of the South and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, although his popularity was dented by attempts to abolish presidential term limits. Following the disputed 2019 election and the ensuing unrest, Morales agreed to calls for his resignation. After this temporary exile, he returned following the election of President Luis Arce.
Morales&#x27; supporters point to his championing of indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism, and credit him with overseeing significant economic growth and poverty reduction as well as increased investment in schools, hospitals, and infrastructure. Critics point to democratic backsliding during his tenure, argue that his policies sometimes failed to reflect his environmentalist and indigenous rights rhetoric, and that his defence of coca contributed to illegal cocaine production.

== Early life and activism ==
=== Childhood, education, and military service: 1959–1978 ===
Morales was born in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia&#x27;s Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959, to an Aymara family. One of seven children born to Dionisio Morales Choque and his wife María Ayma Mamani, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth. In keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.

Morales&#x27; family were farmers; from an early age, he helped them to plant and harvest crops and guard their herd of llamas and sheep, taking a homemade soccer ball to amuse himself. As a toddler, he briefly attended Orinoca&#x27;s preparatory school, and at five began schooling at the single-room primary school in Isallawi. Aged 6, he spent six months in northern Argentina with his sister and father. There, Dionisio harvested sugar cane while Evo sold ice cream and briefly attended a Spanish-language school. As a child, he regularly traveled on foot to Arani province in Cochabamba with his father and their llamas, a journey lasting up to two weeks, in order to exchange salt and potatoes for maize and coca. A big fan of soccer, at age 13 he organized a community soccer team with himself as team captain. Within two years, he was elected training coach for the whole region, and thus gained early experience in leadership.

After finishing primary education, Morales attended the Agrarian Humanistic Technical Institute of Orinoca (ITAHO), completing all but the final year. His parents then sent him to study for a degree in Oruro; although he did poorly academically, he finished all of his courses and exams by 1977, earning money on the side as a brick-maker, day laborer, baker and a trumpet player for the Royal Imperial Band. The latter position allowed him to travel across Bolivia. At the end of his higher education, he failed to collect his degree certificate. Although interested in studying journalism, he did not pursue it as a profession.

Morales served his mandatory military service in the Bolivian Army from 1977 to 1978. Initially signed up at the Centre for Instruction of Special Troops (CITE) in Cochabamba, he was sent into the Fourth Ingavi Cavalry Regiment and stationed at the army headquarters in the Bolivian capital La Paz. These two years were one of Bolivia&#x27;s politically most unstable periods, with five presidents and two military coups, led by General Juan Pereda and General David Padilla respectively; under the latter&#x27;s regime, Morales was stationed as a guard at the &quot;Palacio Quemado&quot; (Presidential Palace).

=== Early &quot;cocalero&quot; activism: 1978–1983 ===

Following his military service, Morales returned to his family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980&#x27;s &quot;El Niño&quot; storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home in the town of Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Morales&#x27; maternal uncle, the family cleared a plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, bananas and later on coca. It was here that Morales learned to speak Quechua, the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare&#x27;s population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in cocaine. Morales joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the 2 August Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.
In El Chapare, Morales joined a trade union of &quot;cocaleros&quot; (coca growers), being appointed local Secretary of Sports. Organizing soccer tournaments, among union members he earned the nickname of &quot;the young ball player&quot; because of his tendency to organize matches during meeting recesses. Influenced in joining the union by wider events, in 1980 the far-right General Luis García Meza had seized power in a military coup, banning other political parties and declaring himself president; for Morales, a &quot;foundational event in his relationship with politics&quot; occurred in 1981, when a &quot;campesino&quot; (coca grower) was accused of cocaine trafficking by soldiers, beaten up, and burned to death. In 1982 the leftist Hernán Siles Zuazo and the Democratic and Popular Union (&quot;Unidad Democrática y Popular&quot; – UDP) took power in representative democratic elections, before implementing neoliberal capitalist reforms and privatizing much of the state sector with United States support; hyperinflation came under control, but unemployment rose to 25%. Becoming increasingly active in the union, from 1982 to 1983, Morales served as the general secretary of his local San Francisco syndicate. In 1983, Morales&#x27; father Dionisio died, and although he missed the funeral, he temporarily retreated from his union work to organize his father&#x27;s affairs.

As part of the War on Drugs, the United States government hoped to stem the cocaine trade by preventing the production of coca; they pressured the Bolivian government to eradicate it, sending troops to Bolivia to aid the operation. Bolivian troops would burn coca crops and, in many cases, beat up coca growers who challenged them. Angered by this, Morales returned to &quot;cocalero&quot; campaigning; like many of his comrades, he refused the US$2,500 compensation offered by the government for each acre of coca he eradicated. Deeply embedded in Bolivian culture, the &quot;campesinos&quot; had an ancestral relationship with coca and did not want to lose their most profitable means of subsistence. For them, it was an issue of national sovereignty, with the United States viewed as imperialists; activists regularly proclaimed &quot;Long live coca! Death to the Yankees!&quot; (&quot;Causachun coca! Wañuchun yanquis!&quot;).

=== General Secretary of the &quot;Cocalero&quot; Union: 1984–1994 ===
From 1984 to 1985, Morales served as Secretary of Records for the movement, and in 1985 he became General Secretary of the August Second Headquarters.
From 1984 to 1991, the &quot;sindicatos&quot; embarked on a series of protests against the forced eradication of coca by occupying local government offices, setting up roadblocks, going on hunger strike, and organizing mass marches and demonstrations. Morales was personally involved in this direct activism and in 1984 was present at a roadblock where 3 &quot;campesinos&quot; were killed. In 1988, Morales was elected to the position of Executive Secretary of the Federation of the Tropics. In 1989, he spoke at a one-year commemoratory event of the Villa Tunari massacre in which 11 coca farmers had been killed by agents of the Rural Area Mobile Patrol Unit (&quot;Unidad Móvil Policial para Áreas Rurales&quot; – UMOPAR). The following day, UMOPAR agents beat Morales up, leaving him in the mountains to die, but he was rescued by other union members. To combat this violence, Morales concluded that an armed &quot;cocalero&quot; militia could launch a guerrilla war against the government, but he soon chose to pursue an electoral path. In 1992, he made various international trips to champion the &quot;cocalero&quot; cause, speaking at a conference in Cuba, and also traveling to Canada, during which he learned of his mother&#x27;s death.

In his speeches, Morales presented the coca leaf as a symbol of Andean culture that was under threat from the imperialist oppression of the United States. In his view, the United States should deal with their domestic cocaine abuse problems without interfering in Bolivia, arguing that they had no right trying to eliminate coca, a legitimate product with many uses which played a rich role in Andean culture. In a speech, Morales told reporters &quot;I am not a drug trafficker. I am a coca grower. I cultivate coca leaf, which is a natural product. I do not refine (it into) cocaine, and neither cocaine nor drugs have ever been part of the Andean culture&quot;. Morales has stated that &quot;We produce our coca, we bring it to the main markets, we sell it and that&#x27;s where our responsibility ends&quot;.

Morales presented the coca growers as victims of a wealthy, urban social elite who had bowed to United States pressure by implementing neoliberal economic reforms. He argued that these reforms were to the detriment of Bolivia&#x27;s majority, and thus the country&#x27;s representative democratic system of governance failed to reflect the true democratic will of the majority. This situation was exacerbated following the 1993 general election when the centrist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (&quot;Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario&quot; – MNR) won the election and Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada became president. He adopted a policy of &quot;shock therapy&quot;, implementing economic liberalization and widescale privatization of state-owned assets. Sánchez also agreed with the U.S. DEA to relaunch its offensive against the Bolivian coca growers, committing Bolivia to eradicating of coca by March 1994 in exchange for US$20 million worth of United States aid, something Morales stated would be opposed by the cocalero movement.

In August 1994, Morales was arrested; reporters present at the scene witnessed him being beaten and accosted with racial slurs by civil agents. Accused of sedition, in jail he began a dry hunger strike to protest his arrest. The following day, 3000 &quot;campesinos&quot; began a march from Villa Tunari to La Paz. Morales would be freed on 7 September 1994, and soon joined the march, which arrived at its destination on 19 September 1994, where they covered the city with political graffiti. He was again arrested in April 1995 during a sting operation that rounded up those at a meeting of the Andean Council of Coca Producers that he was chairing on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Accusing the group of plotting a coup with the aid of Colombia&#x27;s FARC and Peru&#x27;s Shining Path, a number of his comrades were tortured, although no evidence of a coup was brought forth and he was freed within a week. He proceeded to Argentina to attend a seminar on liberation struggles.

== Political rise ==
=== ASP, IPSP, and MAS: 1995–1999 ===
Members of the &quot;sindicato&quot; social movement first suggested a move into the political arena in 1986. This was controversial, with many fearing that politicians would co-opt the movement for personal gain. Morales began supporting the formation of a political wing in 1989, although a consensus in favor of its formation only emerged in 1993. On 27 March 1995, at the 7th Congress of the Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia (&quot;Confederación Sindical Única de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia&quot; – CSUTCB), a &quot;political instrument&quot; (a term employed over &quot;political party&quot;) was formed, named the Assembly for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (&quot;Asamblea por la Sobernía de los Pueblos&quot; – ASP). At the ASP&#x27;s 1st Congress, the CSUTCB participated alongside three other Bolivian unions, representing miners, peasants and indigenous peoples. In 1996, Morales was appointed chairman of the Committee of the Six Federations of the Tropics of Cochabamba, a position that he retained until 2006.

Bolivia&#x27;s National Electoral Court (&quot;Corte Nacional Electoral&quot; – CNE) refused to recognize the ASP, citing minor procedural infringements. The coca activists circumvented this problem by running under the banner of the United Left (IU), a coalition of leftist parties headed by the Communist Party of Bolivia (&quot;Partido Comunista Boliviano&quot; – PCB). They won landslide victories in those areas which were local strongholds of the movement, producing 11 mayors and 49 municipal councilors. Morales was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the National Congress as a representative for El Chapare, having secured 70.1% of the local vote. In the national elections of 1997, the IU/ASP gained four seats in Congress, obtaining 3.7% of the national vote, with this rising to 17.5% in the department of Cochabamba. The election resulted in the establishment of a coalition government led by the right-wing Nationalist Democratic Action (&quot;Acción Democrática Nacionalista&quot; – ADN), with Hugo Banzer as president; Morales lambasted him as &quot;the worst politician in Bolivian history&quot;.
Rising electoral success was accompanied by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement&#x27;s bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (&quot;Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos&quot; – IPSP). The movement&#x27;s bases defected &quot;en masse&quot; to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and Véliz to join the center-right New Republican Force (&quot;Nueva Fuerza Republicana&quot; – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the &quot;cocalero&quot; cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another &quot;cocalero&quot; march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly accused him of being involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.

Morales came to an agreement with David Añez Pedraza, the leader of a defunct yet still registered falangist party named the Movement for Socialism (MAS); under this agreement, Morales and the Six Federaciónes could take over the party name, with Pendraza stipulating the condition that they must maintain MAS&#x27;s own acronym, name and colors. Thus, the MAS and IPSP merged, becoming known as the Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples. The MAS would come to be described as &quot;an indigenous-based political party that calls for the nationalization of industry, legalization of the coca leaf ... and fairer distribution of national resources.&quot; The party lacked the finance available to the mainstream parties, and so relied largely on the work of volunteers in order to operate. It was not structured like other political parties, instead operating as the political wing of the social movement, with all tiers in the movement involved in decision making; this form of organisation would continue until 2004. In the December 1999 municipal elections, the MAS secured 79 municipal council seats and 10 mayoral positions, gaining 3.27% of the national vote, although 70% of the vote in Cochabamba.

===Cochabamba protests: 2000–2002===
In 2000, the Tunari Waters corporation doubled the price at which they sold water to Bolivian consumers, resulting in a backlash from leftist activist groups, including the &quot;cocaleros&quot;. Activists clashed with police and armed forces, in what was dubbed &quot;the Water War&quot;, resulting in 6 dead and 175 wounded. Responding to the violence, the government removed the contract from Tunari and placed the utility under cooperative control. In ensuing years further violent protests broke out over a range of issues, resulting in more deaths both among activists and law enforcement. Much of this unrest was connected with the widespread opposition to economic liberalization across Bolivian society, with a common perception that it only benefited a small minority.

In the Andean High Plateau, a &quot;cocalero&quot; group launched a guerrilla uprising under the leadership of Felipe Quispe; an ethnic separatist, he and Morales disliked each other, with Quispe considering Morales to be a traitor and an opportunist for his willingness to cooperate with White Bolivians. Morales had not taken a leading role in these protests but did use them to get across his message that the MAS was not a single-issue party, and that rather than simply fighting for the rights of the &quot;cocalero&quot; it was arguing for structural change to the political system and a redefinition of citizenship in Bolivia.

In August 2001, Banzer resigned due to terminal illness, and Jorge Quiroga took over as president. Under U.S. pressure, Quiroga sought to have Morales expelled from Congress by saying that Morales&#x27; inflammatory language had caused the deaths of two police officers in Sacaba near Cochabamba. He was unable to provide any evidence of Morales&#x27; culpability. 140 deputies voted for Morales&#x27; expulsion, which came about in 2002. Morales said that it &quot;was a trial against Aymara and Quechas&quot;. MAS activists interpreted it as evidence of the pseudo-democratic credentials of the political class.

The MAS gained increasing popularity as a protest party, relying largely on widespread dissatisfaction with the existing mainstream political parties among Bolivians living in rural and poor urban areas. Morales recognized this, and much of his discourse focused on differentiating the MAS from the traditional political class. Their campaign was successful, and in the 2002 presidential election the MAS gained 20.94% of the national vote, becoming Bolivia&#x27;s second largest party, being only 1.5% behind the victorious MNR, whose candidate, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, became president. They won 8 seats in the Senate and 27 in the Chamber of Deputies. Now the leader of the political opposition, Morales focused on criticising government policies rather than outlining alternatives. He had several unconstructive meetings with Sánchez de Lozada but met with Venezuela&#x27;s Hugo Chávez for the first time.

Just prior to the election, the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia Manuel Rocha issued a statement declaring that U.S. aid to Bolivia would be cut if MAS won the election. However, exit polls revealed that Rocha&#x27;s comments had served to increase support for Morales. (Ambassador Rocha was later arrested by the U.S. Department of Justice on criminal charges of being an agent for the Cuban government.) Following the election, the U.S. embassy characterised Morales as a criminal and encouraged Bolivia&#x27;s traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.

===Rise to prominence: 2003–2005===
In 2003, the Bolivian gas conflict broke out as activists – including coca growers – protested against the privatization of the country&#x27;s natural gas supply and its sale to U.S. companies below the market value. Activists blocked off the road into La Paz, resulting in clashes with police. 80 were killed and 411 injured, among them officers, activists, and civilians, including children. Morales did not take an active role in the conflict, instead traveling to Libya and Switzerland, there describing the uprising as a &quot;peaceful revolution in progress&quot;. The government accused Morales and the MAS of using the protests to overthrow Bolivia&#x27;s parliamentary democracy with the aid of organized crime, FARC, and the governments of Venezuela, Cuba, and Libya.

Morales led calls for President Sánchez de Lozada to step down over the death toll, gaining widespread support from the MAS, other activist groups, and the middle classes; with pressure building, Sánchez resigned and fled to Miami, Florida. He was replaced by Carlos Mesa, who tried to strike a balance between U.S. and cocalero demands, but whom Morales mistrusted. In November, Morales spent 24 hours with Cuban President Fidel Castro in Havana, and then met Argentinian President Nestor Kirchner. In the 2004 municipal election, the MAS became the country&#x27;s largest national party, with 28.6% of all councilors in Bolivia. However, they failed to win the mayoralty in any big cities, reflecting their inability to gain widespread support among the urban middle-classes. In Bolivia&#x27;s wealthy Santa Cruz region, a strong movement for autonomy had developed under the leadership of the Pro Santa Cruz Committee (&quot;Comite Pro Santa Cruz&quot;). Favorable to neoliberal economics and strongly critical of the cocaleros, they considered armed insurrection to secede from Bolivia should MAS take power.

In March 2005, Mesa resigned, citing the pressure of Morales and the cocalero roadblocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé became president of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende&#x27;s successful campaign in the 1970 Chilean presidential election. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the party structure, giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases&#x27; radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his vice-presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS&#x27; primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization of cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.

With a turnout of 84.5%, the election saw Morales gain 53.7% of the vote, while Quiroga came second with 28.6%; Morales&#x27; was the first victory with an absolute majority in Bolivia for 40 years and the highest national vote percentage of any presidential candidate in Latin American history. Given that he was the sixth self-described leftist president to be elected in Latin America since 1998, his victory was identified as part of the broader regional pink tide. Becoming president-elect, Morales was widely described as Bolivia&#x27;s first indigenous leader, at a time when around 62% of the population identified as indigenous; political analysts therefore drew comparisons with the election of Nelson Mandela to the South African Presidency in 1994. This resulted in widespread excitement among the indigenous people in the Americas, particularly those of Bolivia. His election caused concern among the country&#x27;s wealthy and landowning classes, who feared state expropriation and nationalisation of their property, as well as far-right groups, who said it would spark a race war. He traveled to Cuba to spend time with Castro, before going to Venezuela, and then on tour to Europe, China, and South Africa; significantly, he avoided the U.S. In January 2006, Morales attended an indigenous spiritual ceremony at Tiwanaku where he was crowned Apu Mallku (&quot;Supreme Leader&quot;) of the Aymara, receiving gifts from indigenous peoples across Latin America and thanking the goddess Pachamama for his victory.

== President (2006–2019) ==
===First presidential term: 2006–2009===

Morales&#x27; inauguration took place on 22 January in La Paz. It was attended by various heads of state, including Argentina&#x27;s Kirchner, Venezuela&#x27;s Chávez, Brazil&#x27;s Lula da Silva, and Chile&#x27;s Ricardo Lagos. Morales wore an Andeanized suit designed by fashion designer Beatriz Canedo Patiño, and gave a speech that included a minute silence in memory of cocaleros and indigenous activists killed in the struggle. He condemned Bolivia&#x27;s former &quot;colonial&quot; regimes, likening them to South Africa under apartheid and stating that the MAS&#x27; election would lead to a &quot;refoundation&quot; of the country, a term that the MAS consistently used over &quot;revolution&quot;. Morales repeated these views in his convocation of the Constituent Assembly.

In taking office, Morales emphasized nationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-neoliberalism, although did not initially refer to his administration as socialist. He immediately reduced both his own presidential wage and that of his ministers by 57% to $1,875 a month, also urging members of Congress to do the same. Morales gathered together a largely inexperienced cabinet made up of indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals, although over the first three years of government there was a rapid turnover in the cabinet as Morales replaced many of the indigenous members with trained middle-class leftist politicians. By 2012 only 3 of the 20 cabinet members identified as indigenous.

====Economic program====
At the time of Morales&#x27; election, Bolivia was South America&#x27;s poorest nation. Morales&#x27; government did not initiate fundamental change to Bolivia&#x27;s economic structure, and their National Development Plan (PDN) for 2006–10 adhered largely to the country&#x27;s previous liberal economic model. Bolivia&#x27;s economy was based largely on the extraction of natural resources, with the nation having South America&#x27;s second largest reserves of natural gas. Keeping to his election pledge, Morales took increasing state control of the hydrocarbon industry with Supreme Decree 2870; previously, corporations paid 18% of their profits to the state, but Morales symbolically reversed this, so that 82% of profits went to the state and 18% to the companies. The oil companies threatened to take the case to the international courts or cease operating in Bolivia, but ultimately relented. As a result, Bolivia&#x27;s income from hydrocarbon extraction increased from $173 million in 2002 to $1.3 billion by 2006. Although not technically a form of nationalization, Morales and his government referred to it as such, resulting in criticism from sectors of the Bolivian left. In June 2006, Morales announced his plan to nationalize mining, electricity, telephones, and railroads. In February 2007, the government nationalized the Vinto metallurgy plant and refused to compensate Glencore, which the government said had obtained the contract illegally. Although the FSTMB miners&#x27; federation called for the government to nationalize the mines, the government did not do so, instead stating that any transnational corporations operating in Bolivia legally would not be expropriated.

Under Morales, Bolivia experienced unprecedented economic strength, resulting in an increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. Morales&#x27; first year in office ended with no fiscal deficit, which was the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years. During the global financial crisis of 2007–08 Bolivia maintained one of the world&#x27;s highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the level of social spending was increased, it remained relatively low, with a priority being the construction of paved roads and community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.

The government&#x27;s stated intention was to reduce Bolivia&#x27;s most acute poverty levels from 35% to 27% of the population, and moderate poverty levels from 58.9% to 49% over five years. The welfare state was expanded, as characterized by the introduction of non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.

During Morales&#x27; first term, Bolivia broke free of the domination of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) which had characterized previous regimes by refusing their financial aid and connected regulations. In May 2007, it became the world&#x27;s first country to withdraw from the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, with Morales stating that the institution had consistently favored multinational corporations in its judgments. Bolivia&#x27;s lead was followed by other Latin American nations. Despite being encouraged to do so by the U.S., Bolivia refused to join the Free Trade Area of the Americas, deeming it a form of U.S. imperialism.

A major dilemma faced by Morales&#x27; administration was between the desire to expand extractive industries in order to fund social programs and provide employment, and to protect the country&#x27;s environment from the pollution caused by those industries. Although his government professed an environmentalist ethos, expanding environmental monitoring and becoming a leader in the voluntary Forest Stewardship Council, Bolivia continued to witness rapid deforestation for agriculture and illegal logging. Economists on both the left and right expressed concern over the government&#x27;s lack of economic diversification. Many Bolivians opined that Morales&#x27; government had failed to bring about sufficient job creation.

====ALBA and international appearances====
Morales&#x27; administration sought strong links with the governments of Cuba and Venezuela. In April 2005 Morales traveled to Havana for knee surgery, there meeting with the two nations&#x27; presidents, Castro and Chávez. In April 2006, Bolivia agreed to join Cuba and Venezuela in founding the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), with Morales attending ALBA&#x27;s conference in May, at which they initiated with a Peoples&#x27; Trade Agreement (PTA). Meanwhile, his administration became &quot;the least US-friendly government in Bolivian history&quot;. In September Morales visited the U.S. for the first time to attend the UN General Assembly, where he gave a speech condemning U.S. President George W. Bush as a terrorist for launching the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War and called for the UN Headquarters to be moved out of the country. In the U.S., he met with former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and with Native American groups. Relations were further strained between the two nations when in December Morales issued a Supreme Decree requiring all U.S. citizens visiting Bolivia to have a visa. His government also refused to grant legal immunity to U.S. soldiers in Bolivia; hence the U.S. cut back their military support to the country by 96%.

In December 2006, he attended the first South-South conference in Abuja, Nigeria, there meeting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose government had recently awarded Morales the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights. Morales proceeded straight to Havana for a conference celebrating Castro&#x27;s life, where he gave a speech arguing for stronger links between Latin America and the Middle East to combat U.S. imperialism. Under his administration, diplomatic relations were established with Iran, with Morales praising Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a revolutionary comrade. In April 2007 he attended the first South American Energy Summit in Venezuela, arguing with many allies over the issue of biofuel, which he opposed. He had a particularly fierce argument with Brazilian President Lula over Morales&#x27; desire to bring Bolivia&#x27;s refineries – which were largely owned by Brazil&#x27;s Petrobrás – under state control. In May, Bolivia purchased the refineries and transferred them to the Bolivian State Petroleum Company (YPFB).

====Social reform====

Morales&#x27; government sought to encourage a model of development based upon the premise of &quot;vivir bien&quot;, or &quot;to live well&quot;. This entailed seeking social harmony, consensus, the elimination of discrimination, and wealth redistribution; in doing so, it was rooted in communal rather than individual values and owed more to indigenous Andean forms of social organization than Western ones.

Upon Morales&#x27; election, Bolivia&#x27;s illiteracy rate was at 16%, the highest in South America. Attempting to rectify this with the aid of left-wing allies, Bolivia launched a literacy campaign with Cuban assistance, and Venezuela invited 5,000 Bolivian high school graduates to study in Venezuela for free. By 2009, UNESCO declared Bolivia free from illiteracy. The World Bank stated that illiteracy had declined by 5%. Cuba also aided Bolivia in the development of its medical care, opening ophthalmological centers in the country to treat 100,000 Bolivians for free per year, and offering 5,000 free scholarships for Bolivian students to study medicine in Cuba. The government sought to expand state medical facilities, opening twenty hospitals by 2014, and increasing basic medical coverage up to the age of 25. Their approach sought to utilize and harmonize both mainstream Western medicine and Bolivia&#x27;s traditional medicine.

The 2006 Bono Juancito Pinto program provided US$29 per year to parents who kept their children in public school with an attendance rate above 80%. 2008&#x27;s Renta Dignidad initiative expanded the previous Bonosol social security for seniors program, increasing payments to $344 per year, and lowering the eligibility age from 65 to 60. 2009&#x27;s Bono Juana Azurduy program expanded a previous public maternity insurance, giving cash to low-income mothers who proved that they and their baby had received pre- and post-natal medical care, and gave birth in an authorized medical facility. Conservative critics of Morales&#x27; government said that these measures were designed to buy off the poor and ensure continued support for the government, particularly the Bono Juancito Pinto which is distributed very close to election day.

Morales announced that one of the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country&#x27;s indigenous population. To do this, he announced that all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia&#x27;s three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia&#x27;s 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.
Various commentators noted that there was a renewed sense of pride among the country&#x27;s indigenous population following Morales&#x27; election. Conversely, the opposition accused Morales&#x27; administration of aggravating racial tensions between indigenous, white, and mestizo populations, and of using the Racism and Discrimination law to attack freedom of the press.

On International Workers&#x27; Day 2006, Morales issued a presidential decree undoing aspects of the informalization of labor which had been implemented by previous neoliberal governments; this was seen as a highly symbolic act for labor rights in Bolivia. In 2009 his government put forward suggested reforms to the 1939 labor laws, although lengthy discussions with trade unions hampered the reforms&#x27; progress. Morales&#x27; government increased the legal minimum wage by 50%, and reduced the pension age from 65 to 60, and then in 2010 reduced it again to 58.

While policies were brought in to improve the living conditions of the working classes, conversely many middle-class Bolivians felt that they had seen their social standing decline, with Morales personally mistrusting the middle-classes, deeming them fickle. A 2006 law reallocated state-owned lands, with this agrarian reform entailing distributing land to traditional communities rather than individuals. In 2010, a law was introduced permitting the formation of recognized indigenous territories, although the implementation of this was hampered by bureaucracy and contesting claims over ownership. Morales&#x27; government also sought to improve women&#x27;s rights in Bolivia. In 2010, it founded a Unit of Depatriarchalization to oversee this process. Further seeking to provide legal recognition and support to LGBT rights, it declared 28 June to be Sexual Minority Rights Day in the country, and encouraged the establishment of a gay-themed television show on the state channel.

Adopting a policy known as &quot;Coca Yes, Cocaine No&quot;, Morales&#x27; administration ensured the legality of coca growing, and introduced measures to regulate the production and trade of the crop. In 2007, they announced that they would permit the growing of 50,000 acres of coca in the country, primarily for the purposes of domestic consumption, with each family being restricted to the growing of one &quot;cato&quot; (1600 meters squared) of coca.

A social control program was implemented whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, they hoped to remove the need for military and police intervention, and thus stem the violence of previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.

These industrialization measures proved largely unsuccessful given that coca remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving the growers of an international market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia withdrew from the UN 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticized Bolivia, saying that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales&#x27; government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. High levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.

Morales&#x27; government also introduced measures to tackle Bolivia&#x27;s endemic corruption; in 2007, Morales issued a presidential decree to create the Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight Against Corruption. Critics said that MAS members were rarely prosecuted for the crime, the main exception being YPFB head Santos Ramírez, who was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment for corruption in 2008. A 2009 law that permitted the retroactive prosecution for corruption led to legal cases being brought against a number of opposition politicians for alleged corruption in the pre-Morales period and many fled abroad to avoid standing trial.

====Domestic unrest and the new constitution====
During his presidential campaign, Morales had supported calls for regional autonomy for Bolivia&#x27;s departments. As president, he changed his position, viewing the calls for autonomy – which came from Bolivia&#x27;s four eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija – as an attempt by the wealthy bourgeoisie living in these regions to preserve their economic position. He nevertheless agreed to a referendum on regional autonomy, held in July 2006; the four eastern departments voted in favor of autonomy, but Bolivia as a whole voted against it by 57.6%. In September, autonomy activists launched strikes and blockades across eastern Bolivia, resulting in violent clashes with MAS activists. In January 2007, clashes in Cochabamba between activist groups led to fatalities, with Morales&#x27; government sending in troops to maintain the peace. The left-indigenous activists formed a Revolutionary Departmental Government, but Morales denounced it as illegal and continued to recognize the legitimacy of right-wing departmental head Manfred Reyes Villa.

In July 2006, an election to form a Constitutional Assembly was held, which saw the highest ever electoral turnout in the nation&#x27;s history. MAS won 137 of its 255 seats, after which the Assembly was inaugurated in August. The Assembly was the first elected parliamentary body in Bolivia which features strong campesino and indigenous representation. In November, the Assembly approved a new constitution, which converted the Republic of Bolivia into the Plurinational State of Bolivia, describing it as a &quot;plurinational communal and social unified state&quot;. The constitution emphasized Bolivian sovereignty of natural resources, separated church and state, forbade foreign military bases in the country, implemented a two-term limit for the presidency, and permitted limited regional autonomy. It also enshrined every Bolivians&#x27; right to water, food, free health care, education, and housing. In enshrining the concept of plurinationalism, one commentator noted that it suggested &quot;a profound reconfiguration of the state itself&quot; by recognising the rights to self-determination of various nations within a single state.
In May 2008, the eastern departments pushed for greater autonomy, but Morales&#x27; government rejected the legitimacy of their position. They called for a referendum on recalling Morales, which saw an 83% turnout and in which Morales was ratified with 67.4% of the vote. Unified as the National Council for Democracy (CONALDE), these groups – financed by the wealthy agro-industrialist, petroleum, and financial elite – embarked on a series of destabilisation campaigns to unseat Morales&#x27; government. Unrest then broke out across eastern Bolivia, as radicalized autonomist activists established blockades, occupied airports, clashing with pro-government demonstrations, police, and armed forces. Some formed paramilitaries, bombing state companies, indigenous NGOs, and human rights organisations, also launching armed racist attacks on indigenous communities, culminating in the Pando Massacre of MAS activists. The autonomists gained support from some high-ranking politicians; Santa Cruz Governor Rubén Costas lambasted Morales and his supporters with racist epithets, accusing the president of being an Aymara fundamentalist and a totalitarian dictator responsible for state terrorism. Amid the unrest, foreign commentators began speculating on the possibility of civil war.

After it was revealed that USAID&#x27;s Office of Transition Initiatives had supplied $4.5 million to the pro-autonomist departmental governments of the eastern provinces, in September 2008 Morales accused the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Philip Goldberg, of &quot;conspiring against democracy&quot; and encouraging the civil unrest, ordering him to leave the country. The U.S. government responded by expelling Bolivian ambassador to the U.S., Gustavo Guzman. Bolivia subsequently expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) from the country, while the U.S. responded by withdrawing their Peace Corps. Chávez stood in solidarity with Bolivia by ordering the U.S. ambassador Patrick Duddy out of his country and withdrawing the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.S. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) convened a special meeting to discuss the Bolivian situation, expressing full support for Morales&#x27; government.
Although unable to quell the autonomist violence, Morales&#x27; government refused to declare a state of emergency, believing that the autonomists were attempting to provoke them into doing so. Instead, they decided to compromise, entering into talks with the parliamentary opposition. As a result, 100 of the 411 elements of the Constitution were changed, with both sides compromising on certain issues. Nevertheless, the governors of the eastern provinces rejected the changes, believing it gave them insufficient autonomy, while various Indianist and leftist members of MAS felt that the amendments conceded too much to the political right. The constitution was put to a referendum in January 2009, in which it was approved by 61.4% of voters.

Following the approval of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry but said that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija. In response to his victory, Morales proclaimed that he was &quot;obligated to accelerate the pace of change and deepen socialism&quot; in Bolivia, seeing his re-election as a mandate to further his reforms.

===Second presidential term: 2009–2014===
During his second term, Morales began to speak openly of &quot;communitarian socialism&quot; as the ideology that he desired for Bolivia&#x27;s future. He assembled a new cabinet which was 50% female, a first for Bolivia, although by 2012, that had dropped to a third. One of the main tasks that faced his government during this term was the aim of introducing legislation that would cement the extension of rights featured in the new constitution. In April 2010, the departmental elections saw further gains for MAS. In 2013, the government passed a law to combat domestic violence against women.

In December 2009, Morales attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he blamed climate change on capitalism and called for a financial transactions tax to fund climate change mitigation. Ultimately deeming the conference to have been a failure, he oversaw the World&#x27;s People Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth outside of Cochabamba in April 2010.

Following the victories of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, relations between Bolivia and the U.S. improved slightly, and in November 2009 the countries entered negotiations to restore diplomatic relations. After the U.S. backed the 2011 military intervention in Libya by NATO forces, Morales condemned Obama, calling for his Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked. The two nations restored diplomatic relations in November 2011, although Morales refused to allow the DEA back into the country.

In October 2012, the government passed a Law of Mother Earth that banned genetically modified organisms (GMOs) being grown in Bolivia. This was praised by environmentalists and criticized by the nation&#x27;s soya growers, who said that it would make them less competitive on the global market.

In July 2013, Morales attended a summit in Moscow where he said he was open to offering political asylum to Edward Snowden, who was staying in the Moscow airport at the time. On 2 July 2013, while travelling back to Bolivia from the summit, his presidential plane was forced to land in Austria when Portuguese, French, Spanish and Italian authorities denied it access to their airspace. Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said the European states had acted on &quot;unfounded suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on the plane&quot;. The Organisation of American States condemned &quot;actions that violate the basic rules and principles of international law such as the inviolability of Heads of State&quot;, and demanded that the European governments explain their actions and apologise. An emergency meeting of the Union of South American Nations denounced &quot;the flagrant violation of international treaties&quot; by European powers. Latin American leaders describe the incident as a &quot;stunning violation of national sovereignty and disrespect for the region&quot;. Morales himself described the incident as a &quot;hostage&quot; situation. France apologised for the incident the next day. Snowden said that the forced grounding of Morales plane may have prompted Russia to allow him to leave the Moscow airport.

In 2014, Morales became the oldest active professional soccer player in the world after signing a contract for $200 a month with Sport Boys Warnes.
On 31 July 2014, Morales condemned the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict and declared Israel a &quot;terrorist state&quot; because of the ongoing offensive in the Gaza Strip. He said: &quot;Israel does not respect the principles or purposes of the United Nations charter nor the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot;.

====Domestic protests====

Morales&#x27; second term was heavily affected by infighting and dissent from within his support base, as indigenous and leftist activists rejected several government reforms. In May 2010, his government announced a 5% rise in the minimum wage. The Bolivian Workers&#x27; Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rising cost of living, calling a general strike, while protesters clashed with police. The government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack of infrastructure investment. In December 2010, the government cut subsidies for gasoline and diesel fuels, which raised fuel prices and transport costs. Protests led Morales to nullify the decree, responding that he &quot;ruled by obeying&quot;. In June 2012, Bolivia&#x27;s police launched protests against anti-corruption reforms to the police service; they burned disciplinary case records and demanded salary increases. Morales&#x27; government relented, canceling many of the proposed reforms and agreeing to the wage rise.

In 2011, the government announced it had signed a contract with a Brazilian company to construct a highway connecting Beni to Cochabamba, which would pass through the Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS). This would better integrate the Beni and Pando departments with the rest of Bolivia and facilitate hydrocarbons exploration. The plan brought condemnation from environmentalists and indigenous communities living in the TIPNIS, who said that it would encourage deforestation and illegal settlement and that it violated the constitution and United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The issue became an international cause célèbre and cast doubt on the government&#x27;s environmentalist and indigenous rights credentials. In August, 800 protesters embarked on a protest march from Trinidad to La Paz; many were injured in clashes with police and supporters of the road. Two government ministers and other high-ranking officials resigned in protest and Morales&#x27; government relented, announcing suspension of the road. In October 2011, he passed Law 180, prohibiting further road construction, although the government proceeded with a consultation, eventually gaining the consent of 55 of the 65 communities in TIPNIS to allow the highway to be built, albeit with a variety of concessions; construction was scheduled to take place after the 2014 general election. In May 2013, the government announced that it would permit hydrocarbon exploration in Bolivia&#x27;s 22 national parks, to widespread condemnation from environmentalists.

===Third presidential term: 2014–2019===
In 2008, Morales stated that he would not stand for re-election in the 2014 general election. The 2009 Bolivian constitution places a term limit of two consecutive presidential terms. However, a 2013 ruling by the Plurinational Constitutional Court held that Morales&#x27; first term did not count towards the term limit, because it had taken place prior to the ratification of the 2009 constitution. The court ruling, which was criticized by opposition politicians, allowed Morales to run for a third term as president. After standing for re-election and proclaiming victory, Morales declared it &quot;a triumph of the anti-colonialists and anti-imperialists&quot; and dedicated his win to both Castro and Chávez.On the basis of this victory, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; remarked that Morales was &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most popular leaders&quot;. On 17 October 2015, Morales surpassed Andrés de Santa Cruz&#x27;s nine years, eight months, and twenty-four days in office and became Bolivia&#x27;s longest serving president. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ellie Mae O&#x27;Hagan attributes his enduring popularity not to anti-imperialist rhetoric but his &quot;extraordinary socio-economic reforms&quot;, which resulted in poverty and extreme poverty declining by 25% and 43% respectively. Bolivia&#x27;s newly implemented universal healthcare system has been cited as a model for all by the World Health Organization.

In early February 2016 there were rumors that Morales had had a child with a young woman, Gabriela Zapata Montaño, and had granted favors to the Chinese company that she worked for. Morales said that they had had a son who died in infancy, but that he had not granted any favors and had not been in contact with Zapata Montaño since 2007. The commission that investigated the issue concluded that Morales was not at fault. Zapata Montaño was later sentenced to ten years in prison for illegal financial behavior.

Morales attended the swearing-in ceremony of Venezuela&#x27;s president Nicolás Maduro for his second term on 10 January 2019. In April 2019, Morales condemned the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

==== New presidential offices ====

Controversy arose when a new $34 million presidential skyscraper office and residence, the Casa Grande del Pueblo, was constructed in the historical Plaza Murillo. The proposal was initially declined due to municipal height restrictions in the historical district, though Morales&#x27; parliamentary majority in the Plurinational Legislative Assembly overrode the ban, permitting the tower&#x27;s construction. The Casa Grande del Pueblo was inaugurated by Morales on 9 August 2018.

The 29-story tower standing at was the tallest building in the capital city of La Paz when completed. It was designed by Bolivian architects and decorated with indigenous motifs representing traditional Bolivian culture. The skyscraper was built to replace the former presidential palace, which Morales planned to turn into a museum. The building features a helipad and the top two floors were reserved for the president, featuring a gym, spa, Jacuzzi and private elevator. The presidential suite in total was , with the bathroom and dressing room measuring at while the bedroom was . According to &quot;Diario Pagina Siete&quot;, Morales&#x27; bedroom was the same size as the average home provided by his government housing project.

Many analysts and opposition politicians of Morales criticised the spending due to the high levels of poverty in Bolivia. NPR described the new residence as &quot;a luxurious new skyscraper&quot; and that critics contend that &quot;Morales is acting more like an emperor than a president&quot;, while Reuters wrote that Morales &quot;alienated those who once backed him, especially by building the ostentatious presidential palace&quot;. Bolivian Cardinal Toribio Ticona Porco dubbed the tower &quot;Evo Palace&quot; and criticized the opulence invested into it.

After signing the contract for the new building, Morales stated that it was &quot;not a luxury&quot; since it would also house offices for different ministries, cabinet meeting rooms, a center for indigenous ceremonies and a 1,000-seat auditorium as well as rooms for exclusive presidential use. He also stated that the project would reduce government spending by $20 million per year as five other ministries would move into the building. He said the Casa Grande del Pueblo was a break with the past and described the previous residence, the Palacio Quemado or &quot;Burnt Palace&quot;, as a vestige of colonialism and a symbol of neoliberal governments that stripped the State of its wealth, its heritage and its memory. Morales&#x27; communication minister Gísela López responded to criticism, stating that the tower was &quot;a necessity for the people&quot;.

=== 2019 election controversy and resignation ===

Despite Morales&#x27; declaration in 2014 that he would not attempt to alter the constitution so that he could serve a fourth term, Morales began exploring legal efforts to make a fourth term possible in 2015.

====2016 referendum on term limits====

Morales&#x27; party, the Movement for Socialism (MAS), sponsored an effort to amend the constitution by national vote. A referendum was authorized by a combined session of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly on 26 September 2015, by a vote of 112 to 41. On 21 February 2016 the referendum was held on a constitutional amendment to allow presidents to serve three consecutive terms, which would have allowed Morales to run for a fourth term (third under the new constitution). The proposed constitutional amendment narrowly lost.

==== 2017 Supreme Constitutional Tribunal ruling ====
Despite the referendum loss and Morales&#x27; earlier statement that he would not seek a fourth term if he lost the referendum, in December 2016 MAS nominated Morales as their candidate for the 2019 presidential election, stating that they would seek various avenues to ensure the legality of Morales&#x27; candidacy. In September 2017, MAS petitioned the Plurinational Constitutional Court to abolish term limits, based on the reasoning that term limits are a human rights violations under the American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR), a binding multilateral treaty. In November, the Court accepted the grounds of the petition. The ruling enabled Morales to submit his application as a presidential candidate to the Bolivian Electoral Tribunal, who then accepted his application and approved his candidacy.

Critics said that both courts had been stacked with Morales loyalists, some of whom received favorable positions in the government following these decisions.

In response to the decision by the Plurinational Constitutional Court, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, stated that the clause in the American Convention on Human Rights cited by the Court &quot;does not mean the right to perpetual power&quot;. In 2019, Almagro publicly supported Morales&#x27; participation in the 2019 election, saying that &quot;presidents [in other countries]...have taken part in electoral processes on the grounds of a court ruling&quot;. Opposition leader Samuel Doria Medina called the decision &quot;a blow to the constitution&quot;. The court of the ACHR in 2018 reviewed and upheld the legality of term limits, automatically triggering reinstatement of Bolivian term limit laws. The Bolivian Electoral Tribunal had already accepted Morales&#x27; application and declined to void his candidacy.

Between 28 and 30 September 2020, the Inter-American Court met in an advisory hearing to make a subsequent ruling on whether indefinite re-election as a human right was in compliance with the American Convention on Human Rights. At the virtual hearing, the IACHR argued against the ruling of the Bolivian Supreme court, saying &quot;indefinite reelection is contrary to the American Convention due to its negative effects on representative democracy&quot; and &quot;States have the obligation to limit it (reelection). The alternation in power is the basis of representative democracy&quot;. Speaking at the hearing, former Bolivian President, Tuto Quiroga said that the primary objective of the convention was to protect citizens, not be an instrument of &quot;a tyrant&quot;. None of those that submitted the appeal to the Plurinational Constitutional court appeared at the hearing to defend their position.

==== 2019 election ====

A general election was held on 20 October 2019.
From 21 October 2019 until late November, mass street protests and counterprotests occurred in response to claims of electoral fraud. The claims were made after the suspension of the preliminary vote count, in which Morales was not leading by a large enough margin (10%) to avoid an automatic runoff, and the subsequent publication of the official count, according to which he won by just over 10%. The final count, released on 25 October 2019, gave Morales 47.08% of the votes, with 36.51% for runner-up Carlos Mesa.
Disputes about the results began on election night, when there was an unexplained 20 hour break in transmission of the results, leading to widespread protests across the country. Responding to concerns about vote tampering and protests, Morales asked the Organization of American States (OAS) to conduct an audit of the vote count. Morales said he would call for a second-round runoff vote with Mesa if the OAS&#x27; audit found evidence of fraud.

=== Re-evaluation of OAS findings ===
In June 2020, a group of independent researchers in the United States published a report stating that the OAS&#x27;s conclusion about the voting trend indicating election fraud was false and based on statistical errors and incorrect data; their findings were published in the peer-reviewed &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; in 2022. The researchers from Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), made up of a group of political scientists and experts on Latin American politics, concluded that there was &quot;no statistical evidence of fraud&quot; during the 2019 elections. The study found that it was &quot;very likely&quot; that Morales&#x27; first-round election victory was legitimate. &quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently reported on these findings. The study was criticized by the Secretary General of the OAS, Luis Almagro, by the Argentinian newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot; and by Ricardo Kirschbaum writing in &quot;Clarín&quot; as fake news.

On 15 October 2020, a study by Gary A. Hoover from the University of Oklahoma and Diego Escobari from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley found that there was evidence of a &quot;statistically significant electoral case of fraud&quot; that increased the votes of MAS and reduced the votes of the opposition. In a survey conducted in June 2020 by the company IPSOS, for the Unión Nacional de Instituciones para el Trabajo de Acción Social (UNITAS), 73% of respondents agreed with the statement that there had been fraud in the October 2019 elections.

The Bolivian government commissioned a report from the Bisite Deep Tech Lab Research Group of the University of Salamanca. The group&#x27;s report was delivered in July 2021 and found that there was no manipulation of data in the official count or in the Transmission of Preliminary Electoral Results (TREP). After receiving the report, the Bolivian Attorney General&#x27;s Office initially closed its investigation of electoral fraud in the 2019 elections. The Secretary General of the Attorney General&#x27;s Office later said that the investigation was still open. Juan Manuel Corchado Rodríguez, who conducted the study, stated that there were irregularities in aspects of the process, including in the stoppage of the TREP and the breaking of custody of electoral tally sheets, but claimed there was no evidence of fraud or proof that these irregularities significantly altered the outcome.

== Resignation and political asylum ==
Morales resigned as president on 10 November 2019; he called his removal &quot;forced&quot; and a &quot;coup&quot; but also said that he wanted to stop bloodshed from the election protests. He made the announcement from El Chapare, a coca-growing rural area of Cochabamba where he had sought refuge. Mexico immediately offered him political asylum as &quot;his life and safety are at risk&quot; in Bolivia. Armed intruders broke into Morales&#x27; home in Cochabamba and he accused &quot;coup plotters&quot; of an arson attack on his sister&#x27;s home and of putting a price of $50,000 on his head. He said his fellow socialist leaders were being &quot;harassed, persecuted and threatened&quot;. He thanked Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whom he credited with saving his life.

On 11 November, a Mexican government plane flew Morales out of Cochabamba, refuelling in Paraguay before arriving in Mexico. In December, Morales moved from Mexico to Argentina, where he was also granted political asylum. Later that month, an arrest warrant was issued for Morales by Bolivian prosecutors for alleged sedition and terrorism. The interim government alleged that Morales promoted violent clashes in the country before and after he left office. In February 2020, Morales announced that he would run for a seat in the Plurinational Legislative Assembly in the 2020 Bolivian general election. On 20 February however, the national electoral tribunal ruled that Morales was ineligible to run for Senate. In September 2020, Human Rights Watch reported that it had found no evidence that Morales committed acts of terrorism and described the charges against him as politically motivated. In October 2020, the charges were dropped and the arrest warrant dismissed when a court in La Paz found Morales&#x27; rights had been violated and judicial procedures breached.

On 2 October 2024, Argentina revoked the status of refugee for Morales, with the new government of Argentine President Javier Milei calling Morales an &quot;attempted dictator&quot;.

== Post-presidency (2019–present) ==

===Return to Bolivia===
One day after new president Luis Arce was sworn into office, on 9 November 2020 Morales returned to Bolivia after 11 months abroad.

Early decisions made by the Arce administration as well as MAS itself indicated that Morales&#x27; influence in the party had declined. In late November and early December 2020, MAS officials began the process of selecting party candidates to run in the 2021 Bolivian regional elections. In four departments (Chuquisaca, Potosí, Cochabamba, and Pando), candidates for governor endorsed by Morales were not chosen by MAS officials. On 11 December, Morales tweeted Miguel &quot;Chiquitín&quot; Becerra would be the MAS candidate for Governor of Pando. This was met with surprise by MAS officials in Pando as Becerra had not even entered the list of candidates voted on as he did not meet the minimum membership requirement of eight years in the party. Instead, Germán Richter had been chosen as the candidate 5 days prior on 7 December. On 14 December, MAS officials in Tarija and Santa Cruz proclaimed Rodolfo Meyer and Adriana Salvatierra as candidates for mayor of those cities before Morales had had the opportunity to arrive.

The same day in the town of Lauca, Morales participated in a meeting to nominate a candidate for Governor of Santa Cruz. Though Morales initially endorsed former Mayor of Warnes, Mario Cronenbold, he withdrew his support when Cronenbold made statements in favor of not prosecuting Luis Fernando Camacho, an anti-Morales activist. Instead, Morales endorsed former Minister of Government Carlos Romero as a candidate for governor; however, the announcement of the appointment of Romero was rejected by the meeting&#x27;s participants with shouts calling for renewal. The discontent ultimately resulted in one person throwing a plastic chair at Morales in what was dubbed the &quot;silletazo&quot;. Morales blamed the incident on opposition party backers who infiltrated the rally. Half an hour later, Romero was withdrawn as a candidate and Morales announced television presenter Pedro García as the new nominee. However, the following day MAS bases and grassroots social organizations ratified Mario Cronenbold as their candidate for governor in opposition to García.

The &quot;silletazo&quot; was met by various reactions within and outside of the party. Former UD Deputy Rafael Quispe affirmed that the event showed that Morales has &quot;finished his cycle and ... should go home.&quot; Civic Community Senator Andrea Barrientos claimed that the incident proved that &quot;the people have lost their fear of Evo Morales,&quot; emphasizing that Morales&#x27; continued presence was a detriment not only to the country but to MAS as well. Segundina Flores, former MAS Deputy and executive of the Bartolina Sisa Confederation of Women, stated that Morales &quot;deserves respect&quot; and people &quot;cannot be bouncing around with chairs.&quot; However, she also pointed out that the picking of candidates should not be done by the pointing of a finger and that there must be transparency.
As a result of these disputes, protesters in Potosí, El Alto, and Cochabamba expressed their disagreement with decisions that came out of meetings chaired by Morales. At a protest in El Alto on 15 December, MAS supporters rejected continued interference by Morales in the selection of candidates. &quot;Evo wants to nominate other people that not even the people have asked for, we will not allow that anymore. Stop already. El Alto has supported him, now let new people work,&quot; said one protester. Toribio Huanca Mamani, executive member of the Red Ponchos of the Omasuyos province of La Paz stated that &quot;Evo should not get involved in the elections.&quot;

==== COVID-19 ====
On 12 January 2021, Kawsachun Coca radio, the official radio station of the federation of coca growers, released a statement confirming that Morales had tested positive for COVID-19 but that he was &quot;stable and receiving treatment.&quot; The report contradicted Morales&#x27; own statement the day prior in which he told Argentine journalist Juan Cruz Castiñeiras that claims that he had contracted the virus were &quot;invented&quot; by the right and that he &quot;just had a cough problem, nothing more.&quot; He was discharged from the Los Olivos private clinic on 27 January.

==== Congressional pardon ====
In a session of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly held on 12 February 2021, the majority of the Movement for Socialism approved the Presidential Decree for the Granting of Amnesty and Pardon for Humanitarian Reasons and Political Persecuted Persons, granting amnesty to those prosecuted during the government of Jeanine Áñez. The broad pardon, which included Morales, was met by shouts of &quot;democracy yes, dictatorship no&quot; by members of the opposition who objected to the fact that at noon, discussion was ended, beginning the vote, leaving several assemblymen without a chance to speak.

==== Attempted assassination ====
On 27 October 2024, Morales said that he had survived an assassination attempt against him near a military garrison in Villa Tunari following a gun attack on his vehicle that injured his driver. Morales added that a bullet narrowly missed hitting his head. Deputy Security Minister Roberto Rio denied launching a police operation against Morales at the time. Interior minister Eduardo del Castillo later accused Morales of staging the incident, saying that the latter&#x27;s convoy had fled an anti-drugs unit conducting a routine highway patrol, during which Morales security team fired at police and ran over an officer. The incident occurred amid Morales&#x27;s criticism of President Luis Arce, which also led to antigovernment protests. On 1 November, Morales began a hunger strike demanding that Arce&#x27;s government engage in dialogue.

==== 2025 election ====
On 8 November 2024 the Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal barred Morales from running again for president in the 2025 Bolivian general election. The judges based their decision on Article 168 of the Constitution, which states that a citizen can only run for the presidency twice in a row. They interpreted this article to mean that a person can only run for president two times in their entire lifetime. However, Morales&#x27; lawyers called the ruling politically motivated. They argued that Article 168 of the Constitution prohibits a third &quot;consecutive&quot; re-election, emphasizing that the upcoming General Elections in August 2025 will not take place under an Evo Morales presidency. Furthermore, they questioned the legitimacy of the magistrates who had extended their own terms, asserting that they were still operating illegally. It has also been noted that Evo Morales, under Article 167 of the Constitution, remains legally eligible to run for public office, even if he faces criminal charges or is arrested, as long as he has not been convicted through a formal judgment.

==Statutory rape investigation==
Morales has faced two rape accusations. On 7 August 2020, several photographs of him with a supposed minor came to light and began circulating on social networks. Journalist Alejandro Entreambasaguas and Bolivian authorities said that Morales had been in a relationship with the minor since the age of 14. Several news organisations relate the current accusations with comments that Morales had made twice previously on retiring with a &quot;quinceañera&quot; (15-year-old) when he was no longer president. In 2018, Bolivian feminist and journalist María Galindo criticised the then president, saying &quot;The president (Morales) confesses that he uses his public acts to sexually hook the minors who attend those acts. But you have to ask yourself, why does he say it publicly, on a television channel, without any pressure?&quot;

The Ministry of Government subsequently informed the Spanish newspaper &quot;Okdiario&quot; that it had opened a statutory rape investigation to determine whether a romantic and sexual relationship existed between the young woman and Morales while he was president of Bolivia. Morales refused to comment on the case during a telephone interview with the Spanish newspaper. On 19 August 2020, the Bolivian Prosecutor&#x27;s Office began a formal investigation.

The woman was later identified as 19-year-old Noemí Meneses when a statement to police was leaked. In the statement she said she had been in a romantic relationship with Morales since May 2020, and had no previous relations with him. The Bolivian police subsequently placed her under house arrest from which she escaped and fled to Argentina with her parents. After arriving in Argentina, Meneses wrote a letter to the Bolivian Ombudsman saying that the police had kept her from eating for two days and threatened to prosecute her for sedition and terrorism unless she said that she had been in a relationship with Morales. She wrote that the police had &quot;forced [her] to testify under pressure, without a lawyer&quot;. Alleged evidence to corroborate a long-term romantic relationship between Morales and Meneses was obtained and subsequently published by Bolivian and Spanish press, including excerpts from 101 pages of text conversations and phone records between the two, 90 photos of the pair in various locations (including the presidential palace, the presidential jet and in Buenos Aires) and travel receipts of three trips by Meneses to Mexico and Argentina since Morales&#x27; exile. Several sources observe that &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist John Lee Anderson mentions a young girl in Evo&#x27;s company which was alluded to be Meneses. Evo and the girl exchanged glances and Anderson noted that &quot;At some point, Morales interrupted our conversation to tell my photographer not to take photos of the woman&quot;. Anderson later affirmed the girl as being Meneses and stated that he chose the inclusion of her appearance in his article very carefully. The 2020 MAS presidential candidate, Luis Arce Catacora, confirmed that he took a photo with Meneses during Morales&#x27; exile in Buenos Aires, but denied knowing her identity. Meneses says she met Evo Morales when she was 16 years old during the 2015 carnival season. The declaration data indicates that she was born in 2001, implying that she was 14 years old when she met Morales. The circumstances of her arrest are further disputed as well as the use of a stolen government vehicle.

On 21 August 2020, an unrelated complaint of a second statutory rape case was filed against Morales. In this complaint, it is claimed that Morales had a child with a 15 year old and that he is named as the father on the birth certificate. In response, Morales claimed that the complaint was part of a &quot;dirty war&quot; by the interim government against him. The request to arrest Morales was rejected by a judge. On 3 October 2024, justice minister Cesar Siles said an investigation into the alleged statutory rape was still ongoing. A few days later, Morales failed to attend a hearing on the case, which prompted prosecutors to announce plans to have him arrested. This in turn led to demonstrations by his supporters that left at least one police officer injured and 12 protesters arrested.

On 16 December 2024, an arrest warrant was issued against Morales on charges of &quot;trafficking&quot; involving the 15-year-old girl. 

On 17 January 2025, a judge in Tarija ordered the arrest of Morales for the alleged statutory rape of the 15-year-old girl in 2015. The judge also froze Morales&#x27;s assets and banned him from leaving Bolivia.

==Political ideology==
Figures in the Morales government have described the President&#x27;s approach to politics as &quot;Evoism&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Evismo&quot;). From 2009, Morales has advocated &quot;communitarian socialism&quot;, while political scientist Sven Harten characterized Morales&#x27; ideology as &quot;eclectic&quot;, drawing ideas from &quot;various ideological currents&quot;. Harten noted that whilst Morales uses fierce anti-imperialist and leftist rhetoric, he is neither &quot;a hardcore anti-globalist nor a Marxist&quot;, not having argued for the violent and absolute overthrow of capitalism or U.S. involvement in Latin America.

Economically, Morales&#x27; policies have sometimes been termed &quot;Evonomics&quot; and have focused on creating a mixed economy. Morales&#x27; presidential discourse has revolved around distinguishing between &quot;the people&quot;, of whom he sees himself as a representative, and the oppressive socio-economic elite and the old political class, whom he believes have mistreated &quot;the people&quot; for centuries. Morales sought to make Bolivia&#x27;s representative democracy more direct and communitarian, through the introduction of referendums and a citizen-led legislative initiative. George Philip and Francisco Panizza wrote that like his allies Correa and Chávez, Morales should be categorized as a populist, because he appealed &quot;directly to the people against their countries&#x27; political and economic order, divided the social field into antagonistic camps and promised redistribution and recognition in a newly founded political order.&quot;

Various commentators have argued against categorizing the Morales administration as socialist. Bolivia&#x27;s Marxist Vice President Álvaro García Linera says that Bolivia lacks the sufficiently large industrialized working class, or proletariat, to enable it to convert into a socialist society in the Marxist understanding of the word. Instead, he terms the government&#x27;s approach &quot;Andean and Amazonian capitalism&quot;. Marxist American sociologist James Petras has argued that Morales&#x27; government is neither socialist nor anti-imperialist, instead describing Morales as a &quot;radical conservative&quot; for utilizing socialist rhetoric while continuing to support foreign investment and the economic status of Bolivia&#x27;s capitalist class, while British Trotskyist academic Jeffery R. Webber wrote that Morales was not a socialist and his government was &quot;reconstituting neoliberalism&quot;, thereby rejecting &quot;neoliberal orthodoxy&quot; but retaining a &quot;core faith in the capitalist market as the principal engine of growth and industrialization.&quot; Similarly, Aymara activist Felipe Quispe characterized Morales&#x27; government as &quot;neoliberalism with an Indian [i.e. indigenous] face&quot;.

==Personality and personal life==

Morales is ethnically Aymara, and has been widely described as Bolivia&#x27;s first democratically elected president from the indigenous majority. Although Morales has sometimes been described as the first indigenous president to be democratically elected in Latin America, Benito Juárez, a Mexican of the Zapotec ethnic group, was elected President of Mexico in 1858. Biographer Martín Sivak described Morales as &quot;incorruptible, charismatic, and combative&quot;, also noting that he had a &quot;friendly style&quot; and could develop a good rapport with journalists and photographers, in part because he could &quot;articulate his opinions with simplicity&quot;. He also placed a great emphasis on trust, and relied on his intuition, sometimes acting on what he considered omens in his dreams. Harten said that Morales &quot;can be a forceful leader, one who instills great respect and, sometimes, a reluctance in others to contradict him, but he has also learnt to listen and learn from other people.&quot; Farthing and Kohl characterized Morales as a &quot;charismatic populist&quot; of a kind common in Latin American history, who prioritized &quot;a direct relationship&quot; between the population and the leader.

Morales is not married and upon becoming president selected his older sister, Esther Morales Ayma, to adopt the role of First Lady of Bolivia. He has two children from different mothers. They are his daughter Evaliz Morales Alvarado and son Álvaro Morales Paredes. Politician Juan del Granado is Evaliz&#x27;s godfather. His children left Bolivia and traveled to Buenos Aires in late November 2019. Esther Morales died on 16 August 2020, after contracting COVID-19.

Morales has commented that he is only a Roman Catholic in order &quot;to go to weddings&quot;, and when asked if he believed in God, responded that &quot;I believe in the land. In my father and my mother. And in &quot;&quot;.&quot; According to some, Morales lives an ascetic life, with little interest in material possessions. Morales is an association football enthusiast and plays the game frequently, often with local teams.

Morales&#x27; unorthodox behavior contrasts with the usual manners of dignitaries and other political leaders in Latin America. During speeches he made use of personal stories and anecdotes, and used coca as a political symbol, wearing a coca leaf garland around his neck and a hat with coca leaves in it when speaking to crowds of supporters. Following his election, he wore striped jumpers (sweaters) rather than the suits typically worn by politicians. It became a symbol of Morales, with copies of it selling widely in Bolivia.

On 4 July 2018, Morales underwent emergency surgery at a private clinic in La Paz in order to remove a tumor.

==Influence and legacy==

Morales has been described as &quot;the most famous Bolivian ever&quot;, whose personality has become &quot;fixed in the global imagination&quot;. Morales&#x27; government has been seen as part of the pink tide of left-leaning Latin American governments, becoming particularly associated with the hard left current of Venezuela and Cuba. It has been praised for its pro-socialist stance among the international left, who have taken an interest in Bolivia under his leadership as a &quot;political laboratory&quot; or &quot;a living workshop&quot; for the development of an alternative to capitalism. Domestically, Morales&#x27; support base has been among Bolivia&#x27;s poor and indigenous communities. For these communities, who had felt marginalized in Bolivian politics for decades, Morales &quot;invokes a sense of dignity and destiny&quot; in a way that no other contemporary politician has done. He has received the support of many democratic socialists and social democrats, as well as sectors of Bolivia&#x27;s liberal movement, who have been critical of Morales but favored him over the right-wing opposition.

Based on interviews conducted among Bolivians in 2012, John Crabtree and Ann Chaplin described the previous years of Morales&#x27; rule with the observation that: &quot;for many—perhaps most—Bolivians, this was a period when ordinary people felt the benefits of policy in ways that had not been the case for decades, if ever.&quot; Crabtree and Chaplin added that Morales&#x27; administration had made &quot;important changes... that will probably be difficult to reverse&quot;, including poverty reduction, the removal of some regional inequalities, and side-lining of some previously dominant political actors in favor of others who had been encouraged and enabled by his government.

Critics, particularly in the U.S. government, have varyingly termed him &quot;a left-wing radical, a partner of narco-traffickers and a terrorist&quot;. Domestic opposition to Morales&#x27; governance has centered in the wealthy eastern lowland province of Santa Cruz. His policies often antagonized middle-class Bolivians, who deemed them too radical and argued that they threatened private property. His most vociferous critics have been from Bolivia&#x27;s conservative movement, although he has also received criticism from the country&#x27;s far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist. Many of these leftist critics were unhappy that Morales&#x27; government did not make a total break with global capitalism. His government has also faced many of the same complaints directed at previous Bolivian administrations, revolving around such issues as &quot;concentration of power, corruption, incompetent bureaucracies, and disrespect for civil liberties&quot;.

Crabtree and Chaplin&#x27;s study led them to conclude that while Morales&#x27; initial election had brought &quot;huge expectations&quot; from many Bolivians, especially in the social movements, there had been &quot;inevitable frustrations&quot; at his administration&#x27;s inability to deliver on everything that they had hoped. They thought that the &quot;heady optimism&quot; that had characterized Morales&#x27; first term in office had given way to &quot;a climate of questioning and growing criticism of the government and its policies&quot;. Crabtree and Chaplin claimed that though the Bolivian economy had grown, the material benefits had not been as high as many Bolivians had hoped. Crabtree and Chaplin argued that the experiences of his administration had &quot;drawn attention to the difficulties involved in bringing change in the patterns of development in one of Latin America&#x27;s poorest and most unequal nations&quot;. Similarly, Harten thought that Morales&#x27; discourse of &quot;the people&quot; against the socio-economic elites has brought a spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia.

Morales promised to &quot;help bring power&quot; to marginalised groups in Bolivia, a country which has the highest percentage of indigenous population of any country in the Americas. His presidency saw poverty reduced by 42% and extreme poverty reduced by 60%. Mark Schneider of the Center for Strategic and International Studies&#x27; Americas Program, said that there was no question that Morales&#x27;s government was successful in helping to raise the living standards of the poor population which was synonymously the indigenous population. Professor Robert Albro described Morales&#x27;s legacy as &quot;transformation of Bolivian society through the enfranchisement of the country&#x27;s indigenous population.&quot;

===Pragmatic socialism===
Morales&#x27; brand of pragmatic socialism was a program that was one of many among the pink tide that swept throughout the Latin American continent in the 2000s, where a number of left-wing leaders rose to power with socialist and social democratic leanings. Morales was opposed to neoliberal policies of austerity and privatization, and after coming into office in 2006, his administration nationalised the oil and gas sector. Using the funds derived from the nationalised natural gas and oil businesses, his administration invested heavily in basic sanitation, agriculture, education, water resources, transportation and health with the strategic goal to tackle the structural causes of poverty. By 2014, Morales&#x27; anti-poverty programs won him wide support as the country saw poverty reduced by 25%, extreme poverty reduced by 43%, social spending being increased by over 45%, and the real minimum wage being increased by 87.7%. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington in regards to Bolivia&#x27;s economy during Morales&#x27;s governance, &quot;Bolivia has grown much faster over the last eight years than in any period over the past three and a half decades.&quot;

===Authoritarianism===
Under Morales, Bolivia experienced democratic backsliding. According to a 2013 study, &quot;Evo Morales and his Movement Toward Socialism have used trumped-up charges of administrative irregularities, corruption, terrorism, and genocide against numerous opposition politicians, imprisoning some, driving many others out of the country, and intimidating the rest. The competitiveness that is essential to democracy cannot survive in such a hostile setting.&quot; Some scholars characterized Bolivia under Morales as a competitive authoritarian regime. Freedom House classifies Bolivia as a partly-free democracy as of 2023, with a 66/100 score (a report ranking, for comparison, Israel as free with a 74/100 score).

===Allegations of creating a narco-state===

Morales has faced criticism concerning his links with the coca farming in Bolivia and alleged links with the illegal cocaine trafficking market. These range from Morales &quot;closing his eyes to a drug-trafficking problem that is only getting worse&quot; to open accusations that he is facilitating a narco-state. In 2008, two years into his first term as president, he expelled the DEA from the country. Between them, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru produce almost all of the world&#x27;s cocaine. The coca growers unions are allegedly the main drug suppliers for the international market.

From 2003 to 2011, the area used for growing coca illicitly increased year on year but declined to reach a 12-year low in 2015 at 20,400 hectares. In subsequent years, however, illicit coca productions continued to rise to 24,500 hectare in 2017. In 2017, Morales signed a law that increased the legal amount of land in Bolivia designated to coca farming from 12,000 hectares to 22,000 hectares, a figure which has since been exceeded. A 2014 study by the EU estimated only 14,700 hectares was used for chewing and teas. Between 2018 and 2019, the area used for coca farming increased from 23,100 hectares to 25,500, an increase of 10.39%, prompting concern from the EU. The estimated tonnage of coca produced for commercial purposes increased from 19,334 tonnes in 2008 to 24,178 tonnes in 2018, an overall increase of 31.85%. A 2019 UN report said that 94% of coca production in the Chapare, the largest coca region of Bolivia, did not pass through the designated legal market in Sacaba. For Bolivia as a whole, 65% of coca trade was undocumented, accounting for 55,000 tonnes of dry coca leaves. The 2019 report by UNODC also reports increases in the area used for coca farming of up to 171% in five protected areas.

Observers alleged that corruption among political figures and low-level criminal activity associated with the cocaine trade is normal with researcher Diego Ayo from the Vicente Pazos Kanki Foundation considering the power structure of the Bolivian State similar to that of a drug cartel. In 2012, the Brazilian magazine &quot;Veja&quot; accused Evo Morales and his then minister Juan Ramón Quintana, of providing raw material for the production of drugs that were destined for Brazil. That same year senator Roger Pinto asked Brazil for political asylum for fear of an attack on his personal security and for having &quot;evidence of corruption and links with drug trafficking at the highest levels of the government of President Evo Morales&quot;. In October 2020, the FELCN (the Bolivian anti-narcotics police force) and the interim government announced seizures of over 12 tons of cocaine and 436 tons of marijuana in the last year. The FELCN also destroyed 806 factories and 26 cocaine laboratories and confiscated 453 vehicles, 111 buildings and 20 light aircraft and cash.

<text>A table of contents (or simply contents, abbreviated as TOC), is a list usually part of the front matter preceding the main text of a book or other written work containing the titles of the text&#x27;s sections, sometimes with descriptions.

==History==
Pliny the Elder credits Quintus Valerius Soranus (d. 82 BC) as the first author to provide a table of contents to help readers navigate a lengthy work. Pliny&#x27;s own table of contents for his encyclopedic &quot;Historia naturalis&quot; (&quot;Natural History&quot;) may be viewed online in Latin and in English (following dedication).

In the early medieval era, the innovation of tables of contents had to be abandoned, due to the cost of paper. It would not be resumed until after the 12th century, when paper factories in Spain and Italy sprouted and allowed an increase in paper production throughout Europe.

==Form==
The depth of detail in tables of contents depends on the length, complexity, and type of work. For books and most other large written works, tables of contents come after the title page, copyright page, and if appropriate, dedication and epigraph pages. Although they include everything after it, tables of contents never include anything before it. Depending on the complexity or length of the text, the table of contents will include the parts (groups of chapters), if applicable, chapters or section headings, and sometimes chapter or section subheadings.

Formal reports (ten or more pages and being too long to put into a memo or letter) also have a table of contents. Within an English-language book, the table of contents usually appears after the title page, copyright notices, and, in technical journals, the abstract; and before any lists of tables or figures, the foreword, and the preface.

Printed tables of contents indicate page numbers where each part starts, while digital ones offer links to go to each part. The format and location of the page numbers is a matter of style for the publisher. If the page numbers appear after the heading text, they might be preceded by characters called &quot;leaders&quot;, usually dots or periods, that run from the chapter or section titles on the opposite side of the page, or the page numbers might remain closer to the titles. In some cases, the page number appears before the text.

In the case of anthologies or other compilations of works by different authors, each section&#x27;s contributors are usually listed along with the title of the section.

Matter preceding the table of contents is generally not listed there. However, all pages except the outside cover are counted, and the table of contents is often numbered with a lowercase Roman numeral page number. 

== In electronic documents==
Many popular word processors, such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, and StarWriter are capable of automatically generating a table of contents if the author of the text uses specific styles for chapters, sections, subsections, etc.

TOCs in digital books and documents can be created using bookmarks.

==Examples==
Example with leaders:
 Chapter 1: Getting Started . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1
 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2
 Next Steps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

Example without leaders:
 Chapter 1: Getting Started 1
 Introduction 2
 Next Steps 3

Example with authors:
 1. Introduction to Biology &quot;Arthur C. Smith&quot; 1
 2. Microbiology &quot;Susan Jones&quot; 10
 3. Advances in Biotechnology &quot;T.C. Chang&quot; 24

Example with descriptive text:
 Chapter 1 3
 In which we first meet our hero and heroine, attend
 a gala feast, and begin an unexpected journey.
 Chapter 2 12
 The journey takes an unusual turn, and new villains
 are discovered.

<doc id="284194" wikidata="Q4601909" url="?curid=284194" title="2003 Tour de France, Prologue to Stage 9">
<text>The 2003 Tour de France was the 90th edition of Tour de France, one of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours. The Tour began in Paris with a prologue individual time trial on 5 July and Stage 9 occurred on 14 July with a mountainous stage to Gap. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées, back in Paris, on 27 July.

==Prologue==
5 July 2003 — Paris, (ITT)

The opening stage was a short time trial. Covering just 6.5 km the route started under the Eiffel Tower, crossed the river, out to the Place de la Concorde and then back for a finish near to the start.

The trial was won by Bradley McGee of FDJeux edging out Scot, David Millar, by 0.1 seconds after Millar had briefly lost his chain in the last 500 metres. Haimar Zubeldia had set the early pace and held onto first place almost to the end.

Because the Tour was the centennial tour, Armstrong broke with his usual tradition and agreed to begin wearing the yellow jersey. Typically, he prefers to earn each wearing of the jersey himself. This led to one of the rare times that Armstrong has lost the yellow jersey, with it going to Bradley McGee.

==Stage 1==
6 July 2003 — Saint-Denis to Meaux, 

This stage entailed a flat 168 km looping south to Montgeron before heading back north to the village of Meaux.

As expected the race ended in a sprint. An early three man breakaway built up a lead of almost nine minutes before the big teams chased them down, the final man, Andy Flickinger, being caught with 11 km to go. A massive crash in the last kilometre brought down around 140 riders but most of the main sprinters made it through. Alessandro Petacchi of Fassa Bortolo won his first ever stage, beating Robbie McEwen and Erik Zabel in the final metres.

Tyler Hamilton, considered by many to be one of the strongest contenders for overall victory, broke his collarbone in two places in the crash, and was widely reported to have dropped out of the race, though this turned out to be inaccurate, and he went on to win fourth. Levi Leipheimer, however, who was also considered a major contender, did drop out, as did his Dutch teammate from Rabobank, Marc Lotz. Armstrong was involved in the crash, but was relatively uninjured, although he had to borrow a teammate&#x27;s bike to finish the stage. Since the crash was within 1 km of the finish, all of the riders involved got the same time as the rest of the peloton.

==Stage 2==
7 July 2003 — La Ferté-sous-Jouarre to Sedan, 

One of the longest stages of the 2003 race at 204.5 km, this was another mostly flat stage where the sprinters would be likely to excel. A few Category 4 climbs or smaller occurred in the first and last quarters of the race.

The race was similar to Stage 1. A very early breakaway by two riders, Lilian Jégou and Fréderic Finot, built up a lead of over eleven minutes, but their lead was diminished through the afternoon and after Jegou was dropped Finot was finally caught after a breakaway of almost 185 km. In the final mass sprint the Australia FDJeux rider Baden Cooke won, another debutant winner he just beat local rider Jean-Patrick Nazon. Contrary to news reports the day before, Tyler Hamilton did compete, although he came in nearly last.

One small bit of extra drama occurred when rider Frédéric Finot was almost run over by the car of race director Jean-Marie Leblanc. Finot avoided damage, but his bike was destroyed.

==Stage 3==
8 July 2003 — Charleville-Mézières to Saint-Dizier, 

Another flat stage in northern France, 167.5 km including only one Category 4 climb and three intermediate sprints.

Unlike the two preceding stages, the repeated small breakaways were not allowed to build significant leads. The teams of the main sprinters, notably Jean Delatour, kept the race together to compete for the points and time bonuses of the intermediate sprints. High temperatures and high speeds kept the riders together until after the second sprint when Anthony Geslin makes a lone break. His lead reached a maximum of around 3½ minutes and he was caught with just 16 km to the finish. In a mass sprint Alessandro Petacchi claimed his second win, but Frenchman Jean-Patrick Nazon had won sufficient bonuses on the intermediate sprints to take the yellow jersey.

==Stage 4==
9 July 2003 — Joinville to Saint-Dizier, (TTT)

Stage 4 was a team time trial – the riders ride together as a team, with the time of the fifth rider counting. This is considered by the riders to be one of the most difficult parts of road cycling, and is a controversial event thought by many to unfairly disadvantage teams that specialize in climbing.

The winner of the stage was the US Postal team of favorite Lance Armstrong. In the general classification, US Postal riders now held places one through eight, although Armstrong was only in second place, with teammate Víctor Hugo Peña in first. Peña was the first rider from Colombia to wear the yellow jersey, and won it the day before his birthday.

Of the other main contenders, Joseba Beloki, Jan Ullrich and Francisco Mancebo did not lose much time, but Gilberto Simoni and Iban Mayo lost 3 minutes.

==Stage 5==
10 July 2003 — Troyes to Nevers, 

After a fast start, a group of five riders, László Bodrogi, Nicolas Jalabert, Jens Voigt, Ludovic Turpin and Frédéric Finot, got away, but the gap never grew over 3 minutes, the teams of the sprinters keeping a high velocity on the peloton. Again the stage ends in a mass sprint, and again Petacchi manages to take it, showing himself the best sprinter in this year&#x27;s Tour. Whether he is also the best sprinter overall remained questionable, since the team of Mario Cipollini was not invited to this year&#x27;s Tour. The day ended with Peña still wearing yellow, and Armstrong still in second, one second behind.

==Stage 6==
11 July 2003 — Nevers to Lyon, 

Lyon is the first of the six cities that was also visited in the first Tour de France in 1903, and thus this was one of the six stages involved in the one-off Centenaire competition. Stuart O&#x27;Grady and Anthony Geslin attacked, and seemed to finally be able to have a breakaway attempt succeed, their lead growing to 18 minutes, and still being 8 minutes with 50 kilometers to go, but the teams of the sprinters once again were successful in catching the attackers, only 500 meters before the finish. Once again Petacchi scored a convincing win in the sprint, and takes his fourth win in five normal stages! His latest win also gains him the green jersey of the points classification. Peña, meanwhile, remained in yellow, one second ahead of Armstrong. Petacchi, after winning four stages, finally got hold of the green jersey as leader of the points classification for the first time.

==Stage 7==
12 July 2003 — Lyon to Morzine, 

The first mountain stage, although not an extremely heavy one, with 5 climbs, of which one of the first category but none of the (even heavier) hors catégorie. On the first climb, Benoit Poîlvet, Paolo Bettini and Rolf Aldag attacked, later joined by Richard Virenque, the eventual winner of the polka dot jersey, who dropped the others one by one, and took the stage and the yellow jersey from Peña, who had declared in interviews prior to the race that he was going to start working for Lance to win. A group of 45 riders came in at 4 minutes behind Virenque. It contained most contenders for the general classification, but Gilberto Simoni and Santiago Botero were not in there, and lost over 6 minutes to Lance Armstrong and the others. After the first mountains, their chances in this year&#x27;s tour seemed to be over already. Among the seven riders who dropped out during the stage, was Alessandro Petacchi, the wearer of the green jersey. Baden Cooke, who inherited the jersey after Petacchi&#x27;s retirement, described Petacchi as &quot;soft&quot;.

==Stage 8==
13 July 2003 — Sallanches to Alpe d&#x27;Huez, 

The second day in the mountains was a long 219 km including the Col du Télégraphe, the Col du Galibier and a finish on the famous Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Richard Virenque was first over the initial climb and the peloton did not break-up until an early attack after the Cote de Megève split the peloton in two. The leading group contained most of the major names and produced a series of attacks, dropping contender Gilberto Simoni from the group early on, with Richard Virenque, Jan Ullrich, and Stefano Garzelli also getting dropped.

Eventually, Joseba Beloki launched an attack, and was eventually chased down by a breakaway pack consisting of Armstrong, Hamilton, Iban Mayo, and Haimar Zubeldia. Beloki was caught with 9 km to go, and Iban Mayo launched an attack, going on to win the stage; he could have won by quite a greater margin, but he slowed down on the last kilometer of Alpe d&#x27;Huez to celebrate the moment. Armstrong held off attacks from many riders, although Alexander Vinokourov managed to get away and take second. Armstrong won the sprint for third place, with the associated time bonus, giving him his first yellow jersey of the Tour, forty seconds ahead of Beloki, who was now looking to be a major challenger.

==Stage 9==
14 July 2003 — Le Bourg-d&#x27;Oisans to Gap, 
Although the biggest climbs in this stage were at the beginning, it was the much smaller ones at the end that proved decisive. Several attacks in the early race brought groups ahead, possibly the most important rider in these was Jörg Jaksche. Being a teammate of GC number 2 Joseba Beloki, and himself not very far behind Armstrong, his intention was probably to force Armstrong&#x27;s team to work, which makes them less capable of defending him against Beloki later in the stage or in the coming stages. At the end of the final (fourth category) climb of Cote de La Rochette, Vinokourov was in position to win a second stage, after having received the order to attack previously in order to compensate for the time his teammate Santiago Botero was going to lose due to stomach problems.

During the descent, however, shortly after passing the Col de Manse, Beloki locked his wheel on the melting road surface, flying out of control, and falling on his head, shoulder, and hip. He badly injured his elbow, and despite trying to get back on his bike, was taken to the hospital, dropping out of the Tour with several broken bones. His injuries proved severe enough that he was also forced to miss the 2004 Tour de France. Lance Armstrong, sitting just behind Beloki, managed some quick thinking, swerving off the road through a field, getting off his bike, hopping over a small embankment, and resuming the chase. He may have been assisted in his cross-country journey through the practice he gained racing cyclo-cross events in the off-season. Despite a hard chase, Vinokourov kept the lead and took the stage, as well as second place in the general classification.

<doc id="284195" wikidata="Q3705326" url="?curid=284195" title="Democratic Leadership Council">
<text>The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) was a non-profit 501(c)(4) corporation that was active from 1985 to 2011. Founded and directed by Al From, it argued that the United States Democratic Party should shift away from the leftward turn it had taken since the late 1960s. One of its main purposes was to win back white middle-class voters with ideas that addressed their concerns. The DLC hailed the election and reelection of Bill Clinton as proof of the viability of Third Way politicians and as a DLC success story.

The DLC&#x27;s affiliated think tank was the Progressive Policy Institute. Democrats who adhered to the DLC&#x27;s philosophy often called themselves &quot;New Democrats.&quot; This term is also used by other groups who hold similar views, including the New Democrat Network and Third Way.

On February 7, 2011, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that the DLC would dissolve. On July 5 of that year, DLC founder Al From announced in a statement on the organization&#x27;s website that the historical records of the DLC have been purchased by the Clinton Foundation.
The DLC&#x27;s last chairman was Representative Harold Ford of Tennessee, and its vice chair was Senator Tom Carper of Delaware. Its CEO was Bruce Reed.

==Founding and early history==
The DLC was founded by Al From in 1985 in the wake of Democratic candidate and former vice president Walter Mondale&#x27;s landslide defeat by incumbent president Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. Other founders include Democratic Governors Chuck Robb (Virginia), Bruce Babbitt (Arizona) and Lawton Chiles (Florida), Senator Sam Nunn (Georgia) and Representative Dick Gephardt (Missouri).

The model on which the Democratic Leadership Council was built was the Coalition for a Democratic Majority. Founded by &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson Democrats in response to George McGovern&#x27;s massive loss to Richard Nixon in 1972, the CDM was dismayed by two presidential election losses and the organization&#x27;s goal was to steer the party away from the New Left influence that had permeated the Democratic party since the late 1960s and back to the policies that made the FDR coalition electorally successful for close to 40 years. Although Senator Jackson declined to endorse the organization, believing the timing was inappropriate, future DLC founders and early members were involved, such as Senators Sam Nunn and Charles S. Robb.

In the early 1980s, some of the youngest members of Congress, including Representative William Gray of Pennsylvania, Tim Wirth of Colorado, Al Gore of Tennessee, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, and Gillis Long of Louisiana helped found the House Democratic Caucus&#x27; Committee on Party Effectiveness. Formed by Long and his allies after the 1980 presidential election, the CPE hoped to become the main vehicle for the rejuvenation of the Democratic Party. The CPE has been called &quot;the first organizational embodiment of the New Democrats.&quot;

The DLC started as a group of forty-three elected officials and two staffers, Al From and Will Marshall, and shared their predecessor&#x27;s goal of reclaiming the Democratic Party from the left&#x27;s influence prevalent since the late 1960s. Their original focus was to secure the 1988 presidential nomination of a southern conservative Democrat such as Nunn or Robb. After the success of Jesse Jackson, a vocal critic of the DLC, in winning a number of southern states in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; primary, the group began to shift its focus towards influencing public debate. In 1989, Marshall founded the Progressive Policy Institute, a think tank which has since turned out policy blueprints for the DLC. Its most extensive series of papers is the series of &quot;New Economy Policy Reports&quot;.

==Positions==
The DLC has stated that it &quot;seeks to define and galvanize popular support for a new public philosophy built on progressive ideals, mainstream values, and innovative, non-bureaucratic, market-based solutions.&quot; It has supported welfare reform, including the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, President Clinton&#x27;s expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the creation of AmeriCorps.

In 2004, columnist David Sirota strongly criticized the DLC as having sold out to corporate interests. Sirota&#x27;s article &quot;The Democrats&#x27; Da Vinci Code&quot; argued that progressive politicians are more successful.

In 2006, the DLC urged Senate Democrats to vote against Bush&#x27;s nomination of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court but opposed any filibuster of the nominee.

==Electoral and political success==
A Gallup poll of Democratic National Committee members (in February 2005) showed that, by more than two-to-one (52%-23%) the DNC members wanted the party to become more moderate, rather than more liberal. That view was shared by Democrats nationally; in a January 2005 survey, Gallup found that 59% of Democrats wanted the party to take a more moderate course.

Although progressive critics argue the DLC&#x27;s centrism has led the Democratic party to multiple electoral defeats, DLC candidates, office holders, and their moderate policies have been generally favored by the American electorate. When the Democratic party won majority status in the Senate in 1986, it was done with centrist and DLC affiliated candidates Barbara Mikulski (a participant in the DLC&#x27;s National Service Tour), Harry Reid (who once said Democrats have to &quot;swallow their pride&quot; and move toward the middle), Conservative Democrat Richard Shelby, DLCer Bob Graham, DLCer Kent Conrad, and DLCer Tom Daschle. When Bill Clinton, former chairman of the DLC, made up his mind to run for the presidency in 1992, the DLC spotted the right candidate to promote its mission. Bill Clinton ran his 1992 and 1996 campaigns as a New Democrat and (prior to Obama&#x27;s 2012 presidential re-election) became the only twice elected Democratic president since President Franklin D. Roosevelt (though only one other Democratic president in the years after FDR, Jimmy Carter, was ever a candidate for a second term). New Democrats made significant gains in both the 2006 midterms and the 2008 elections. While explicitly denying any direct connection to the DLC in 2003, in May 2009 President Obama reportedly declared to the House New Democrat Coalition, &quot;I am a New Democrat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama: &#x27;I am a New Democrat&#x27;, Jonathan Martin &amp; Carol E. Lee, 3/10/09 7:04 PM EST, Updated: 3/11/09 9:55 AM EST&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political analysts like Kenneth Baer contend the DLC embodies the spirit of Truman-Kennedy era Democrats and were vital to the Democratic party&#x27;s resurgence after the election losses of liberals George McGovern, Walter Mondale, and Michael Dukakis. Simon Rosenberg, a long time Democratic campaign operative and strategist, said, &quot;there is a strong argument to be made that the DLC has been the most influential think tank in American politics over the past generation ... the DLC helped set in motion a period of party modernization that has helped the Democratic Party overcome the potent and ultimately ruinous rise of the New Right.&quot;

==2004 presidential primary==
In May 2003, as the Democratic primary of the 2004 presidential campaign was starting to pick up, the organization voiced concern that the Democratic contenders might be taking positions too far left of the mainstream general electorate. Early front-runner Howard Dean, who attracted popular support due in large part to his anti-war views despite his reputation as a centrist governor of Vermont, was specifically criticized by DLC founder and CEO Al From.

Senator John Kerry won the Democratic primary and chose primary contender Senator John Edwards as his running mate. Both were members of the Senate New Democrat Coalition.

==2008 presidential primary==
The 2008 Democratic primary pitted New York Senator Hillary Clinton, a prominent DLC member, against Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who had previously stated that his positions on NAFTA, the Iraq War and universal health care made him &quot;an unlikely candidate for membership in the DLC.&quot; However, President Obama surrounded himself with DLC members, appointing Clinton herself as Secretary of State. In May 2009, President Obama reportedly declared to the House New Democrat Coalition, the congressional arm of the DLC, &quot;I am a New Democrat.&quot; President Obama has also called himself a progressive and has been endorsed by Howard Dean&#x27;s progressive political action committee Democracy for America.

<text>The 2003 Tour de France was the 90th edition of Tour de France, one of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours. The Tour began in Paris with a prologue individual time trial on 5 July and Stage 10 occurred on 15 July with a flat stage from Gap. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées, back in Paris, on 27 July.

==Stage 10==
15 July 2003 — Gap to Marseille, 

A long, largely flat 219.5 km stage after three days in the mountains gave the majority of the riders a chance to recuperate, the pace was somewhat slower than the average to this stage. The roadside temperature was high (around 40 °C).

A group of nine riders made a break after just 16 km and slowly built their lead up, to 17 minutes by halfway and to a maximum of around 23 minutes. With such a substantial lead the nine rider group began to fragment with repeated attacks from around 50 km to go, José Enrique Gutiérrez made a solo break and led into Marseille, he was closed down and passed by Fabio Sacchi and then Jakob Piil. These two riders worked together and soon built up a minute lead over the others. Entering the final 2 km to the finish Piil and Sacchi shook hands and began to race, Piil led out but managed to hold off Sacchi to become the first Danish stage winner since Bjarne Riis in 1996. Bram de Groot broke from the chasers to finish third and the peloton came in over 21 minutes down. The top positions in the general classification were unchanged, the best placed rider in the breakaway was over ¾ of an hour down on Armstrong.

==Stage 11==
17 July 2003 — Narbonne to Toulouse, 

After the first rest day, one of the shortest stages of the tour at 153.5 km, another flat stage with only one climb, the third category Cote de Saissac at 82 km. The Tour has finished a stage in Toulouse 24 times before, the last time in 1985.

There were a number of early breakaways and one early crash but the US Postal team worked hard to keep the field together. It was not until early afternoon, just before Carcassonne, that a group of eight riders made it clear. They built up their lead to a maximum of around four minutes. With the peloton closing and 10 km to go Juan Antonio Flecha of Banesto attacked from the breakaway and built up a small lead of 20 seconds. Despite the field closing in he held on to win the stage by 4 seconds, the peloton coming in less than a minute behind. Former Tour star Jens Voigt, struggling with illness, abandoned the race.

==Stage 12==
18 July 2003 — Gaillac to Cap Découverte, (ITT)

The first time trial (not counting the prologue) was late this year, usually it is contested before the first mountain stage. Most expected Armstrong to take it, although in previous days he had shown to be not as strongly reigning as in previous years, but in the end he lost one and a half minutes to Jan Ullrich although winning over the rest of the field. Alexander Vinokourov took third place and remained with Armstrong and Ullrich in the contest for the final win, putting the other favourites at a little distance. Tyler Hamilton is now in fourth place, hanging on despite a broken collarbone from the fall in stage 2.

==Stage 13==
19 July 2003 — Toulouse to Plateau de Bonascre (Ax 3 Domaines), 

The 197.5 km route marked the beginning of four days in the mountains, a flattish first 120 km with two sprints ended in two category one climbs, the Port de Pailhères at 168.5 km and the finish on the Plateau de Bonascre. Again the weather was very hot.

There were a number of early attacks, the peloton chased each escapee down only for another group to try to break. Eventually around midday a group of ten made it clear and after some effort the peloton did not chase them over and the group built up a maximum lead of almost nine minutes. As the first climb was reached the ten-man group had a lead of around six minutes, on the Port de Pailhères the leaders faltered and the group broke up. The group containing the race leaders closed in during the climb and at the summit the leading three (Sastre, Rubiera and Mercado) had two minutes over their chasers. On the start of the 9 km climb to the finish the leaders had retained their two-minute advantage. Over the climb the three leaders were gradually caught but Sastre and Mercado held out, with 3 km to go the peloton started to break, attacks from Zubeldia and Vinokourov put the riders under pressure and while Ullrich caught up Armstrong was dropped. Sastre won and Ullrich came second, Armstrong recovered to reduce his loss to 7 seconds. With the time bonus for Ullrich coming second Armstrong&#x27;s overall lead was reduced to 15 seconds. However, according to specialists, this was the day that Ullrich should have won the Tour. Still suffering the consequences of the dehydration he had suffered during the previous Time Trial, Armstrong fell back badly at the beginning of the last climb, the Plateau de Bonascre, but Ullrich failed to capitalise on Armstrong&#x27;s weakness and he didn&#x27;t attack, winning only seven seconds (plus the time bonus) over the Texan rider. There is speculation about if it was an error of Ullrich&#x27;s or whether he had not the physical capacity to attack.

==Stage 14==
20 July 2003 — Saint-Girons to Loudenvielle-le-Louron, 

The second day in the Pyrenees, the 191.5 km stage had two category two climbs and four category one climbs spaced throughout the route. The toughest climbs were the Col de la Core at 67 km, Col de Menté at 118.5 km, the Col du Portillon at 156 km and the final climb and descent of the Col de Peyresourde at 180 km. The route included the second category Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet, where Fabio Casartelli was mortally injured in 1995.

Just 162 riders started the stage. There was a very early break of seventeen riders, including Richard Virenque, Gilberto Simoni, Jakob Piil and Manuel Beltrán. The group steadily increased their lead over the US Postal led peloton in the early part of the race. By the first category two climb they were over nine minutes clear, by the Col de la Core over twelve minutes. When the deficit hit almost fifteen minutes the teams of USP and Euskaltel joined at the front of the peloton, later they were joined by Telekom and then Bianchi. By the Col du Portet d&#x27;Aspet the lead was reduced to around eleven minutes and on the Col de Menté the leading 17 were showing signs of fatigue and began to drop riders, a group of twelve being led by Virenque over the summit.
The tour then entered Spain for a few kilometres before the climb of the Col du Portillon, where the leading group broke up with a trio of Dufaux, Simoni and Virenque leading the peloton by seven minutes over the summit. The trio remained ahead up the Col de Peyresourde as the field behind them split under repeated attacks, while Armstrong stuck close to Ullrich Vinokourov broke away. Dufaux, Simoni and Virenque kept their lead; they were joined by Peron and fought out the finish, Simoni winning the sprint. Vinokourov led in two others was 41 seconds down and Armstrong and Ullrich came in 1&#x27; 24&quot; later.

==Stage 15==
21 July 2003 — Bagnères-de-Bigorre to Luz Ardiden, 

Another day in the Hautes-Pyrénées. The 159.5 km stage had three big climbs, the category one Col d&#x27;Aspin at 94 km, the famous hors catégorie Col du Tourmalet at 124 km and finally a hors catégorie finish at Luz Ardiden. These were the last hors catégorie climbs on the 2003 Tour.

The stage had another fast start but the real excitement was reserved for the final 13 km up to Luz Ardiden in what was to turn out to be one of the most epic Tour de France stages in the Armstrong &#x27;era&#x27;. In the earlier part of the race Botero and Chavanel escaped and built up a lead of around ten minutes by the Col d&#x27;Aspin. On the ascent of the Col du Tourmalet Ullrich made a number of efforts to drop Armstrong, but with no success. By the summit the main riders were still together and the now lone escapee, Chavanel, was four minutes clear. The chasing group of Ullrich and Armstrong was seven strong and had all the main contenders except Vinokourov, who was having a tough time and only briefly joined them at the start of the final climb.

At the start of the final ascent Chavanel was five minutes up on his chasers. The chasing group remained together until about 10 km to go, Mayo attacked and was matched by Armstrong but as Armstrong set himself up for a further push he tangled with the musette bag of a young spectator and crashed, bringing down Mayo and almost Ullrich too. The main group, including Ullrich and marshalled by his friend and former colleague Tyler Hamilton, slowed for Armstrong to catch up. Armstrong did catch up despite almost coming off again when the gear on his damaged bike slipped, almost as soon as Mayo and Armstrong reached the main group they attacked again in a repeat of the situation before the crash. This time a determined Armstrong dropped Mayo and Ullrich and powered off like a man possessed after the lone Chavanel. He caught Chavanel with about 4 km to the finish, sportingly tapping him on the back to acknowledge his efforts, as he passed him to win the stage, his sixteenth stage victory and probably his last chance to gain some time over Ullrich before the final time trial. Ullrich had fallen over a minute behind but, typically, by the finish had fought back and reduced his loss to 40 seconds, not including time bonuses some of which were denied him by Mayo who took 2nd place. Richard Virenque had, barring accidents, won the polka-dot jersey.

==Stage 16==
23 July 2003 — Pau to Bayonne, 

A 197.5 km stage in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, there were six climbs, two major – the Col du Soudet at 67.5 km and the Col Bagarguy at 110 km. The descent of the Col Bagarguy is interrupted by the minor Cote de Burdincurutcheta, a Basque name.

As often this year the stage started fast and was marked by early breakaway attempts. The early attempts were chased down, the high pace (48 km in the first hour) briefly dropped Tyler Hamilton but his CSC team-mates brought him back to the peloton. Around midday a group of fifteen riders made it clear before the Col du Soudet. The leading group broke up during the ascent. Hamilton attacked from the peloton at 55 km and jumped across to the leaders, around three minutes up on the peloton, before the summit. The leaders stayed together over the next small climb and maintained their lead, they dropped a number of riders including David Millar who quickly fell back to and through the peloton. On the ascent of the Col Bagarguy Hamilton attacked the leading group and raced ahead alone. He had a two-minute lead at the summit and almost four minutes over the peloton. In the fog over the Cote de Burdincurutcheta he extended his lead. The chasers were gradually caught by the peloton on the long flattish run to the finish but Hamilton pushed his lead out to five minutes. His lead started to fall with 25 km to go, but despite Fassa Bortolo, Euskaltel and Telekom leading the chase Hamilton stayed clear to win his first Tour stage ever.

==Stage 17==
24 July 2003 — Dax to Bordeaux, 

After the Pyrenees this 181 km was short and almost absolutely flat, the highest climb was 79 m. Traditionally the stages into Bordeaux have been won by one of the sprinters.

The race started with an attack by ten riders within the first minutes. The peloton reacted at first but after holding the gap at around sixty seconds for about 25 km the chase slowed and by 40 km the lead was up to six minutes and at around 70 km the breakaway&#x27;s lead peaked at just over sixteen minutes. The peloton cut into the escapees lead but too slowly to catch them and with about 40 km to go and an eight-minute gap the peloton again slowed. With 18 km to the finish Servais Knaven attacked from the leading group and held off their disorganised chase to win. Robbie McEwen headed peloton in eight minutes later. The competition for the Green jersey remained very close.

==Stage 18==
25 July 2003 — Bordeaux to Saint-Maixent-l&#x27;École, 

A flat 203.5 km with no climbs, two sprints and a moderate tailwind crossing four &quot;departments&quot;. With the time trial looming another breakaway success looked possible.

With the favourable conditions and the 25 km/h wind the stage started very fast. There were a few small attacks early on; a group of around thirty made a break at 26 km to be swept up at 40 km. The peloton was still together at the first intermediate sprint in Montendre, unusually Jan Ullrich made a race of it, he was chased by Armstrong and they came second and third behind Robbie McEwen, getting small time bonuses that cut Ullrich&#x27;s deficit by two seconds. Shortly after the sprint, at 61 km, a group of sixteen made a break and unlike early attempts they stayed clear. Working together the escapees quickly built up their lead to over 11 minutes by the 100 km point, the first two hours of racing passed with an average speed of 52 km/h. The lead continued to grow reaching a maximum of just over 22 minutes with around 25 km to the finish. The leading group then started to break-up as there were repeated solo attacks, the group split with eight riders moving clear. With 10 km to go attacks started from within the smaller group, David Canada making it clear with a trio of riders chasing after him. In the final kilometre Canada&#x27;s lead vanished – he was passed by the chasing trio who contested a very close sprint, Pablo Lastras just winning. The peloton came in 24:05 later. The green jersey competition was still very close, it could still change hands on the final Stage in Paris.

Despite the amazing early speed the race slowed in the second portion, becoming just the second fastest road stage in Tour history. At an average speed of 49.938 km/h it was still inferior to the 50.355 km/h of Stage Four in 1999 (Laval to Blois, 194.5 km).

==Stage 19==
26 July 2003 — Pornic to Nantes, (ITT)

The second long individual time trial. 49 km, flatter than the first long time trial and raced in cool rain on slippy roads rather than 30-plus °C.

The final chance for Jan Ullrich to stop Armstrong winning five-in-a-row. The two rode through in almost identical times, but shortly after the second time check at 32.5 km Ullrich fell while taking the curve on a small roundabout. Ullrich&#x27;s challenge was over. The stage was won by David Millar who, despite illness and the adverse weather, set the second fastest time trial in the Tour, 54.358 km/h (Greg LeMond 54.545 km/h (1989)). A year later David Millar was excluded from the 2004 Tour, and banned from the sport for 2 years, after syringes with traces of EPO were found at his home – he admitted that this time trial was one of the occasions that he had boosted his performance with the drug.

==Stage 20==
27 July 2003 — Ville-d&#x27;Avray to Paris, 

This was the final stage of the 2003 Tour. Traditionally a relaxed ride into Paris then a hectic ten circuits of the 6.5 km Champs-Élysées loop. Ville d&#x27;Avray was the finishing point of the 1903 Tour. With only the sprinter&#x27;s green jersey still undecided, the two intermediate and the finish were hotly contested.

At the final stage 147 riders started. With the wet roads the stage began slowly; there was a leisurely challenge for the final climbing stage, the category 4 Mont Valerian. As usual the race heated up as the first intermediate sprint at 66 km neared. The sprinter&#x27;s teams, FDJ and Lotto, led out and Baden Cooke was first followed by Robbie McEwen, leaving the two on equal points. Attacks from other riders then began, small groups making it clear to be quickly caught as the second intermediate sprint at 95 km approached. At that sprint McEwen won and Cooke was second. As the pace slowed after the sprint more riders leapt off the peloton; on the sixth lap a group of eight riders made a break and working hard built up their lead to 45 seconds. Playing tactics, the peloton held back, not beginning the chase until the final three laps. On the last lap the escape was finally caught with about 5 km to go. In an extremely close finish Jean-Patrick Nazon won the stage with Cooke just beating McEwen for second and claiming the green jersey by two points. Armstrong finished prudently far down the field, losing 15 seconds to some of his rivals.

<doc id="284216" wikidata="Q3352817" url="?curid=284216" title="Extrajudicial punishment">
<text>Extrajudicial punishment is a punishment for an alleged crime or offense which is carried out without legal process or supervision by a court or tribunal through a legal proceeding.

==Politically motivated==

Extrajudicial punishment is often a feature of politically repressive regimes, but even self-proclaimed or internationally recognized democracies have been known to use extrajudicial punishment under certain circumstances.

Although the legal use of capital punishment is generally decreasing around the world, individuals or groups deemed threatening—or even simply &quot;undesirable&quot;—to a government may nevertheless be targeted for punishment by a regime or its representatives. Such actions typically happen quickly, with security forces acting on a covert basis, performed in such a way as to avoid a massive public outcry and/or international criticism that would reflect badly on the state. Sometimes, the killers are agents outside the government. Criminal organizations, such as La Cosa Nostra, have reportedly been employed for such a purpose.

Another possibility is for uniformed security forces to punish a victim, but under circumstances that make it appear as self-defense or suicide. The former can be accomplished by planting recently fired weapons near the body, the latter by fabricating evidence suggesting suicide. In such cases, it can be difficult to prove that the perpetrators acted wrongly. Because of the dangers inherent in armed confrontation, even police or soldiers who might strongly prefer to take an enemy alive may still kill to protect themselves or civilians, and potentially cross the line into extrajudicial murder.

A forced disappearance (or enforced disappearance) occurs when a person is secretly abducted or imprisoned by a state or political organization or by a third party with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of a state or political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the person&#x27;s fate and whereabouts, with the intent of placing the victim outside the protection of the law.

Extrajudicial punishment may be planned and carried out by a particular branch of a state, without informing other branches, or even without having been ordered to commit such acts. Other branches sometimes tacitly approve of the punishment after the fact. They can also genuinely disagree with it, depending on the circumstances, especially when complex intragovernmental or internal policy struggles also exist within a state&#x27;s policymaking apparatus.

In times of war, natural disaster, societal collapse, or in the absence of an established system of criminal justice, there may be increased incidences of extrajudicial punishment. In such circumstances, police or military personnel may be unofficially authorised to severely punish individuals involved in looting, rioting and other violent acts, especially if caught &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;. This position is sometimes itself corrupted, resulting in the death of merely &quot;inconvenient&quot; persons, that is, relative innocents who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

==Around the world==

===Historically===

Wyatt Earp led a federal posse, in the Earp Vendetta Ride, during the spring of 1882 which was implicated in the murder of four outlaw &quot;Cowboys&quot; they believed had ambushed his brothers Virgil and Morgan Earp, maiming the former and killing the latter.

The NKVD troika and Special Council of the NKVD are examples from the history of the Soviet Union, where extrajudicial punishment &quot;by administrative means&quot; was part of the state policy. Other Soviet Bloc secret police organizations like the East German Stasi, Romanian Securitate have also used it from time to time.

Most Latin American dictatorships have regularly instituted extrajudicial killings of their enemies; for one of the better-known examples, see &quot;Operation Condor.&quot;

The deaths of the leaders of the leftist urban guerrilla group, the Red Army Faction, Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe in West Germany are regarded by some of those in the radical left movements as extrajudicial killings, a theory partly based on the testimony of Irmgard Möller.

During the apartheid years (from 1948 until the early 1990s), South Africa&#x27;s security forces were also accused of using extrajudicial means to deal with their political opponents. After his release, Nelson Mandela would refer to these acts as proof of a Third Force. This was denied vehemently by the administration of F.W. de Klerk. Later the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu would find that both military and police agencies such as the Civil Cooperation Bureau and C10 based at Vlakplaas were guilty of gross human rights violations. This led the International Criminal Court to declare apartheid a crime against humanity.

===Present day===

In Mainland China, a system of administrative detentions called Re-education through labor (&quot;láodòng jiàoyǎng&quot; 劳动教养, abbreviated láojiào 劳教) was used to detain persons for minor crimes such as petty theft, prostitution, and trafficking illegal drugs for periods of up to four years. Re-education through labor sentences were given by the police, rather than through the judicial system.

In the Netherlands, prosecutors and tax inspectors can procure punishments without due process (&quot;Strafbeschikking&quot;), a practice that has been increasingly criticised by members of the Dutch Second Chamber, such as Michiel van Nispen. 

For many years, the Jamaican Constabulary Force has been noted for its extrajudicial killings. With 140 police killings in a population of 3 million, &quot;Jamaica’s police force [is] among the deadliest in the world&quot;.

It has been discussed that the use of psychiatric treatments to reduce unwanted behaviors can be seen as extrajudicial punishments, due to many side-effects associated to these treatments.

The US has been known to employ extrajudicial tactics including extraordinary rendition. Some critics use the term &quot;torture by proxy&quot; to describe situations in which the CIA and other US agencies have employed rendition techniques to transfer suspected terrorists to countries known to utilize torture. While denied by the US, where it is a crime to transfer anyone to any location for the purpose of torture, critics claim that torture has been employed with the knowledge or acquiescence of US agencies. Condoleezza Rice (then the United States Secretary of State) stated:

The CIA has been accused of operating secret detention and interrogation centres known as black sites. These are allegedly located in countries other than the US, thus evading US laws as they are outside US jurisdiction.

===Human rights groups===
Many human rights organisations like Amnesty International campaign against extrajudicial punishment.

<text>Quezon City (, ; ), also known as the City of Quezon and Q.C. (read and pronounced in Filipino as Kyusi), is the richest and most populous city in the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 2,960,048 people. It was founded on October 12, 1939, and was named after Manuel L. Quezon, the second president of the Philippines.

The city was intended to be the national capital of the Philippines that would replace Manila, as the latter was suffering from overcrowding, lack of housing, poor sanitation, and traffic congestion. To create Quezon City, several barrios were carved out from the towns of Caloocan, Marikina, San Juan and Pasig, in addition to the eight vast estates the Philippine government purchased for this purpose. It was officially proclaimed the national capital on October 12, 1949, and several government departments and institutions moved out of Manila and settled into the new capital city. This necessitated the expansion of the city northward, carving out Novaliches from Caloocan which divided it into two non-contiguous parts. Several barrios were also taken from San Mateo and parts of Montalban. However, on June 24, 1976, Presidential Decree No. 940 was enacted, which reverted national capital status to Manila while the whole of Metro Manila was designated as the seat of government. The city was also chosen as the regional center of Southern Tagalog, which was created in 1965, along with the provinces of Quezon and Aurora, the birthplace of Manuel L. Quezon; however, its status of regional center became ineffective when the region was divided into Calabarzon and Mimaropa, through the effect of Executive Order No. 103 in May 2002 under the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and Aurora was transferred to the authority of Central Luzon, with Southern Tagalog limited to being a cultural-geographic region.

Quezon City is known for its culture, entertainment industry and media, and is aptly called the &quot;City of Stars&quot;. Major broadcasting networks have their headquarters and studios in the city. It is also known for its commerce, education, research, technology, politics, tourism, art and sports. Several national government branches including the Batasang Pambansa Complex, the seat of House of Representatives of the Philippines, call the city home.

Quezon City is a planned city. It covers a total area of , making it the largest city in Metro Manila/NCR in terms of land area. It is politically subdivided into Six Congressional Districts, which represent the city in the Lower House of the Congress of the Philippines. The city has 142 barangays under the City Government. National government departments and agencies are mostly situated in the first National Government Center (NGC) in Diliman. and the second National Government Center in Batasan Hills, where the Lower House of the Philippine Congress is located. Most of the city&#x27;s northern part lies at the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountain range, including the La Mesa Watershed Reservation, the largest watershed in Metro Manila and a designated protected area.

According to its 2023 estimated census, Quezon City had 3.1 million people in its boundaries, and () in its gross domestic product (GDP), and it is the only planned city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines.

====Initial plans for a new capital city====

Before the creation of Quezon City, the land on where it would eventually rise was part of several towns such as Caloocan, Mariquina (Marikina), Montalban (renamed as Rodriguez), Pasig, San Mateo, and San Juan del Monte (renamed as San Juan), all under Manila province and, beginning in 1901, Rizal province.

In the 1930s, Manila&#x27;s urban problems were apparent and problematic. It lacked public housing, where thousands of the city&#x27;s residents lived in congested informal settler communities, especially in the central districts of Binondo, Intramuros, Quiapo, San Nicolas and Tondo. There were also problems with sanitation and traffic congestion. The rise of slums in Manila gave rise to the development of its suburbs outside the city limits in the municipalities of Pasay, San Felipe Neri (renamed as Mandaluyong), San Francisco del Monte, Makati, and San Juan del Monte. These towns became favorable to the upper and middle-class who wanted to escape the congested city but had economic links to it.

President Manuel L. Quezon, aware of the problems besetting Manila, initiated housing projects called &quot;Barrio Obrero&quot; (&quot;Worker&#x27;s Community&quot;). These communities were established in various places in Manila such as Avenida Rizal, Sta. Cruz and Barrio Vitas, Tondo. However, the project failed miserably and these communities became slum areas.

Alejandro Roces Sr., a prominent Filipino author, was said to be influential in Quezon&#x27;s vision to establish a new city. Quezon dreamed of a city where the common people could live and thrive. Roces suggested that a sizeable tract of land be purchased for this purpose. However, the government had no available fund except for in the hands of the National Development Company (NDC).
In order to make Quezon&#x27;s dream a reality and to mobilize funds for the land purchase, the People&#x27;s Homesite Corporation (PHC) was created on October 14, 1938, as a subsidiary of NDC, with an initial capital of . Roces was the chairman of the Board of PHC, and they immediately acquired the vast Diliman Estate of the Tuason family at a cost of 5 centavos per square meter. PHC conducted topographical and subdivision surveys, and then subdivided the lots and sold them to the target buyers at an affordable price. Its target users and beneficiaries were Manila&#x27;s working class, who were suffering from a shortage of affordable and decent housing in the capital. The service of the Metropolitan Waterworks system was extended to site. The Bureau of Public Works, then under Secretary Vicente Fragante, constructed the streets and highways within the property. Quezon also tapped Architect Juan M. Arellano to draft a design of the city.
Eight vast estates were acquired in order to create Quezon City: Diliman Estate, , Santa Mesa Estate, , Mandaluyong Estate, , Magdalena Estate, , Piedad Estate, , Maysilo Estate, and the San Francisco Del Monte Estate, . Quezon&#x27;s goal was to create a place for the working class, coinciding with the planned transfer of the University of the Philippines campus in Manila to a more suitable location, which became another precedent for the creation of Quezon City.

As early as 1928, the University of the Philippines (UP) had planned to expand by adding more academic units and constructing new buildings. The university experienced increase in enrollment and its planned expansion was hampered by its small campus in Manila. The revised Burnham Plan of Manila envisioned the new campus to be located just outside Manila&#x27;s city limits at &#x27;the heights behind Manila&#x27;. The UP Board of Regents informed Quezon of their desire to relocate the campus and he was supportive of the idea. Furthermore, he wanted the facilities in the Manila campus to be used for government purposes. In 1939, Quezon urged the National Assembly to enact UP&#x27;s relocation and on June 8, 1939, Commonwealth Act No. 442 was passed, enacting the transfer of UP outside of Manila. A portion of Mariquina Estate, which was adjacent to Magdalena Estate, was chosen as the new site with an approximate area of . Additional land from the Diliman Estate was also added as part of the new university campus.

====Creation of Quezon City====

With the development of the People&#x27;s Homesite Corporation housing in the Diliman Estate and the creation of the new UP Campus, the creation of Quezon City was justified. On October 12, 1939, Commonwealth Act No. 502, also known as the Charter of Quezon City, was passed by the National Assembly, which created Quezon City. Surprisingly, Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law because he did not sign it. The city was originally to be known as Balintawak City according to the first bill filed by Assemblyman Ramon P. Mitra Sr. from Mountain Province, but Assemblymen Narciso Ramos and Eugenio Perez, both from Pangasinan, amended and successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the President in honor of his role in the creation of this new city. The creation of Quezon City halted the full implementation of the Burnham Plan of Manila and funds were diverted for the establishment of the new capital.

Several barangays from different towns were carved out to correspond to the estates that PHC bought for the creation of Quezon City. The new city had an area of , and the barrios and sitios that were taken for its creation were the following: Bagubantay (Bago Bantay), Balingasa, Balintauac (Balintawak), Kaingin, Kangkong, Loma (La Loma), Malamig, Matalahib, Masambong, San Isidro, San Jose, Santol and Tatalon, were taken from Caloocan; Cubao, Diliman, Kamuning, New Manila, and San Francisco del Monte were taken from San Juan; Balara, Barranca (Barangka), Jesus de la Peña, Krus na Ligas, Tañong and the site of the new UP Campus were taken from Marikina; and, the barrios and sitios of Libis, and Ogong (Ugong Norte) from Pasig. Commonwealth Act No. 659, enacted on June 21, 1941, changed the city&#x27;s boundaries. Under this law, the area of Wack Wack Golf and Country Club were to be reverted to Mandaluyong, and the barrios of lower Barranca and Jesus de la Peña were reverted to Marikina. However, Camp Crame was taken out of San Juan and was given to Quezon City.

1939, the year the city was established, recorded a population of 39,103 people. The city in its early days was predominantly rural, but Quezon asked American Architect William Parsons to craft a master plan for the newly created city. Parsons was the one who advised Quezon to locate the National Government Center in Diliman instead of Wallace Field (now Rizal Park), due to the possibility of naval bombardment from Manila Bay. He died in December 1939 and his partner Harry T. Frost took over and become the lead planner. Frost arrived in the Philippines on May 1, 1940, and became the architectural adviser of the Philippine Commonwealth government. Together with Juan M. Arellano, Alpheus D. Williams, and Welton Becket, they created the Master Plan for Quezon City which was approved by the Philippine government in 1941. The Frost Plan featured wide avenues, large open spaces, and roundabouts at major intersections. The plan for major thoroughfares made by Louis Croft for the Greater Manila Area served as the backbone for the Plan of Quezon City. The center of the city was a quadrangle formed by four avenues — North, West, South and East — which was designed to be the location of the National Government of the Philippines. At the northeast corner of the Quadrangle was a large roundabout, a elliptical site, were the proposed Capitol Building is envisioned to rise.

To make the city accessible, Quezon ordered Luzon Bus Lines to ply from Kamuning towards Tutuban in Divisoria, Manila to provide transport for the city&#x27;s residents. However, the fare was not affordable to minimum wage earners. Because of the city&#x27;s unaffordable housing prices and lack of transportation for low-income earners, the goal of creating mass housing for the working class was not met. Instead, those who opted to live in Quezon City consisted of middle-class households such as those in Kamuning, whose residents petitioned to rename it from &quot;Barrio Obrero&quot; (Worker&#x27;s Community) to Kamuning (a type of tree that grows abundantly in the area) because its residents were not &quot;Obreros&quot; (Workers).

===Japanese occupation===
The Philippine Exposition in 1941 was held on the newly established Quezon City, but participants were limited to locals because of the increasing turbulence at the beginning of the Second World War. Eventually, parts of Manila were bombed by the Japanese Imperial Forces in December 1941, bringing the war to the Philippines. On January 1, 1942, President Quezon issued Executive Order No. 400 as an emergency measure to form the City of Greater Manila, with Jorge B. Vargas as its designated mayor. It merged the city with Manila and the towns of Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Parañaque, Pasay, and San Juan. The mayors of these towns and cities served as the assistant mayor of their respective localities and were under the mayor of Greater Manila. The City of Greater Manila was the basis for the formation of Metro Manila in 1975.

After Imperial Japanese forces conquered the Philippines during the Pacific War, the City of Greater Manila was reorganized in 1942 into twelve districts, two of which were formed by dividing Quezon City: Balintawak which consisted of San Francisco del Monte, Galas, La Loma, New Manila, Santa Mesa Estate, the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club, and the present-day Greenhills, San Juan; and Diliman which was composed of Diliman proper, Cubao, the University District, and the present-day eastern portion of Marikina. In the same year, the patients of Quezon Institute were relocated to the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Intramuros and the Japanese military used the facility for its own sick and wounded. The Japanese renamed some streets, most notably South Avenue which became Timog Avenue. In 1945, when the Americans returned to Luzon, they gave numerical designations to some roads such as Route 54, which is now Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. In the same year, combined Filipino and American troops under the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army, and Philippine Constabulary, with help from recognized guerrilla units, liberated and recaptured Quezon City in February, expelling Imperial Japanese forces. Heavy fighting occurred in Novaliches, which at that time was within Caloocan, and New Manila which had been fortified. Smaller actions were fought at Barrio Talipapa and the University District. After the Battle of Manila, the City of Greater Manila was dissolved by President Sergio Osmeña, thus separating the cities and towns that were consolidated and regaining their pre-war status. The area which formed the city was then governed by the Philippine Executive Commission.

===The postwar and independence era===

On July 17, 1948, President Elpidio Quirino signed Republic Act No. 333 into law, making Quezon City the capital of the Philippines. The Act created the Capital City Planning Commission, which was tasked to develop and implement a masterplan for the city. As the capital, the city was expanded northwards, and the barrios of Baesa, Bagbag, Banlat, Kabuyao, Novaliches Proper (&quot;Bayan&quot;/&quot;Poblacion&quot;), Pasong Putik, Pasong Tamo, Pugad Lawin, San Bartolome, and Talipapa in Novaliches were ceded from Caloocan. This territorial change caused the division of Caloocan into two non-contiguous parts. Quezon City was formally inaugurated as the capital on October 12, 1949. President Quirino laid the cornerstone on the proposed Capitol Building at Constitution Hills.

On June 16, 1950, the Quezon City Charter was revised by Republic Act No. 537, changing the city&#x27;s boundaries to an area of . Exactly six years later, on June 16, 1956, more revisions to the city&#x27;s territory were made by Republic Act No. 1575, which defined its area as . However, according to the 1995 GIS graphical plot, the city&#x27;s total area is , making it the largest Local Government Unit in Metro Manila in terms of land area.

===The Marcos administration===
The turn of the decade from the 1960s to the 1970s brought an era of change and tumult throughout the Philippines, with many of the historically significant events of the era taking place in or involving people and groups from Quezon City.
==== Before Martial Law ====
When Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; economic policy of using foreign loans to fund government projects during his second term resulted in the 1969 balance of payments crisis, students from Quezon City-based universities, notably the University of the Philippines Diliman and Ateneo de Manila University were among the first to call for change, ranging from moderate policy reforms to radical changes in form of government.

Students from these Quezon City schools, representing a spectrum of positions, were thus at the front lines of the major protests of the first three months of 1970 – what would later be called the &quot;First Quarter Storm.&quot; A year later in 1971, this was followed up by the Diliman Commune, in which the students, faculty, and residents of UP Diliman initially planned to protest an impending oil price hike, but because of violent attempts to disperse them, also later demanded that Marcos&#x27; military pledge not to assault the campus in the future.

==== After the Martial Law proclamation ====
Marcos&#x27; declaration of martial law in September 1972 saw the immediate shutdown of all media not approved by Marcos, including Quezon City media outlets such as GMA Channel 7 and ABS-CBN Channel 2. At the same time, it saw the arrest of many students, journalists, academics, and politicians who were considered political threats to Marcos, many of them residents of Quezon City. By the morning after Marcos&#x27; televised announcement of the proclamation, about 400 of these arrestees were gathered in Camp Crame on the southwestern reaches of Quezon City, destined to be among the first of thousands of political detainees under the Marcos dictatorship.

Camp Crame would be the site of many of the human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, with one of the first being the murder of student journalist Liliosa Hilao in Camp Crame. Among the prominent cases of abuse suffered specifically by Quezon City residents were the cases of Primitivo Mijares and his sixteen-year-old son Boyet Mijares, who lived in Project 6 at the time of their deaths; Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao social worker Purificacion Pedro who was murdered by a soldier at her hospital room in Bataan; 23-year old Kamias resident and student activist Roland Jan Quimpo who became a desaparecido; and Cubao-based tailor Rolando &quot;Lando&quot; Federis who was abducted by armed men in Lucena City while accompanying a group of activists to Bicol, tortured, and then killed. In addition, a large number of student activists who were caught, detained, tortured, sexually abused, killed, and disappeared by the regime had been studying in the various universities and colleges in Quezon City.

One of the key moments that led to the eventual demise of the Marcos dictatorship was the 1974 Sacred Heart Novitiate raid, in which a Catholic seminary in Novaliches was raided on the suspicion that communist leaders were hiding there. The arrest of Fr. Benigno Mayo who was the head of the Jesuit order in the Philippines at the time, and Fr. Jose Blanco alongside 21 members of the youth group called Student Catholic Action (SCA), helped convince &quot;the formerly neutral Philippine middle class&quot; that Marcos&#x27; powers had grown too great.

As international pressure forced Marcos to start restoring civil rights, other key moments in Philippine history took place in Quezon City. Journalist Joe Burgos established the Quezon City-based WE Forum newspaper in 1977 and in it published a story by Colonel Bonifacio Gillego in November 1982 which discredited many of the Marcos medals. Media coverage of the September 1984 Welcome Rotonda protest dispersal showed how opposition figures including 80-year-old former Senator Lorenzo Tañada and 71-year old Manila Times founder Chino Roces were waterhosed despite their frailty and how student leader Fidel Nemenzo (later Chancellor of the University of the Philippines Diliman) was shot nearly to death.

Most significantly, the August 1983 funeral of assassinated opposition leader of Ninoy Aquino began at the Aquino family household in Times Street, West Triangle, Quezon City, and continued to the funeral mass at Santo Domingo Church in Santa Mesa Heights before the final interment at the Manila Memorial Park – Sucat. The procession took from 9:00 AM until 9:00 PM to finish as two million people joined the crowd. The experience galvanized many of the Philippines into resisting the dictatorship, with protests against Marcos snowballing until they happened nearly every week, and until Marcos was ousted by the People Power revolution.

==== Physical and administrative changes during the Marcos administration ====
In terms of administrative changes during this period, the region of Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7, 1975. The region encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns, as a separate regional unit of government. A year later, on June 24, 1976, Manila was reinstated by President Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period. Presidential Decree No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world, the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade, commerce, education and culture. Concurrent with the reinstatement of Manila as the capital, Ferdinand Marcos designated his wife, Imelda Marcos, as the first governor of Metro Manila, who started the construction of massive government edifices with architectural significance as she re-branded Manila as the &quot;City of Man&quot;.

On March 31, 1978, President Marcos ordered the transfer of the remains of President Quezon from Manila North Cemetery to the newly completed Quezon Memorial Shrine. It now houses the mausoleum where President Quezon and his wife Aurora Aragon Quezon are interred. It also contains a museum dedicated to President Quezon and his life.

===EDSA Revolution===
In 1986, the nonviolent People Power Revolution, led by Corazon Aquino and Cardinal Jaime Sin, ousted Marcos from power. Thousands of people flocked EDSA between Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo in a series of popular demonstrations and civil resistance against the Marcos government that occurred between February 22 and 25, 1986.

==== Commemorative monuments ====

All of the three major monuments commemorating the Martial Law era are located in Quezon City. The People Power Monument and the EDSA Shrine were built in the city to commemorate the event, with the latter being a symbol of the role that the Catholic Church played in the restoration of democracy in the Philippines. The Bantayog ng mga Bayani was constructed along Quezon Avenue to honor the heroes and martyrs that struggled under the 20-year Marcos regime. The Wall of Remembrance at the Bantayog honors prominent figures during the martial law era.

===Contemporary===
On February 23, 1998, Republic Act. No. 8535 was signed by President Fidel Ramos, which paved the way for the creation of the City of Novaliches by carving out the 15 northernmost barangays of Quezon City. The voting process only includes the affected barangays, but then-city mayor of the town Ismael &quot;Mel&quot; Mathay Jr. lobbied to include the whole city. He also campaigned against the secession of Novaliches. In the succeeding plebiscite that was held on October 23, 1999, an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches. Mathay was succeeded by Feliciano Belmonte Jr., who served as the city mayor from 2001 to 2010.

On May 1, 2001, numerous residents of Barangay Holy Spirit who were protesting against the arrest of former president Joseph Estrada marched from EDSA Shrine to Malacañang and participated in the May 1 riots against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

In the 2010 local elections, actor Herbert Bautista, who served as Vice mayor during Mathay&#x27;s and Belmonte&#x27;s terms, was elected as the city mayor. During his term, the Quezon City Pride Council was established. It was the first LGBT council in the Philippines. He also initiated numerous socialized housing projects called &quot;Bistekville&quot;. Bautista was succeeded by Maria Josefina &quot;Joy&quot; Belmonte in 2019, who has served as the Vice Mayor under his term and the daughter of former Quezon City mayor Feliciano Belmonte Jr. She was then reelected as City Mayor in 2022, after which the Quezon City People&#x27;s Council was established. Under the Participation, Accountability and Transparency Ordinance, the council would serve as an umbrella for about 2,232 civil society organizations accredited by the city government as a means for more civic participation and as for the council to be the “eyes, ears and voice” of the city residents in the city government.

Beginning March 15, 2020, Quezon City was placed under community quarantine, which were introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The strictest quarantine was the enhanced community quarantine in 2020 and 2021, in response to the then-ongoing pandemic in the city, which has infected more than 100,000 of the city&#x27;s residents with more than 1,200 deaths. The quarantine was later downgraded to the alert level system (ALS) in 2021 until the state of public health emergency was lifted by President Bongbong Marcos on July 21, 2023.

==Geography==
The geography of Quezon City is characterized by undulating terrain. The city is within the catchment area of five river systems – Marikina, Pasig, San Juan, Tullahan and Meycauayan – along with their creeks and tributaries with a total length of almost . The city has an area of , according to the 1995 GIS graphical plot, making it the largest Local Government Unit (LGU) in Metro Manila in terms of land area. Since its creation in 1939, the city&#x27;s boundary were revised four times; the final revision was made thru Republic Act No. 1575, which placed the city&#x27;s territory at . Meanwhile, the Philippine Statistics Authority placed the city&#x27;s land area at , based on data provided by the Land Management Bureau. According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and Geoscience Australia on their study earthquake impact and risk assessment on the Greater Metropolitan Manila Area, the total area of Quezon City is at .

Quezon City is bounded by Rodriguez and San Jose del Monte to the north, Marikina and San Mateo to the east, Pasig to the southeast, Mandaluyong and San Juan to the south, Manila to the southwest, and Caloocan and Valenzuela to the west and northwest. The city lies on the Guadalupe Plateau, a relatively high plateau at the northeast of the metropolis situated between the lowlands of Manila to the southwest and the Marikina River Valley to the east. The highest elevation in Quezon City is the northern tip of the La Mesa Watershed Reservation at above sea level. The West Valley Fault traverses the eastern border of the city.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen climate classification, Quezon City has a tropical monsoon climate (Am). The city has a dry season from December to April, in which in turn, divided into cool and warm dry seasons, and a prolonged wet season from May to November that brings heavy rains in some areas.

The primary weather station of the city is located at the PAGASA Science Garden. It has been observed that extreme temperatures ranged from a record high of to a record low of . The hot season was observed for 1.5 months, from April to May, with an average daily high temperature of . Meanwhile, the cool season lasts for 2.6 months, from November to February, with an average temperature of below .

About 20 typhoons enter the Philippines every year, affecting Quezon City and the rest of Metro Manila. In recent years, heavy rainfalls from &quot;Habagat&quot; (south west monsoon) became as destructive as typhoons, triggering floods and landslides which endangers the city&#x27;s residents living near the riverbanks.
==City districts==
Quezon City is politically subdivided into six legislative districts. However, the city is also divided into non-legislative or informal districts based on its historical origins. For instance, the district of San Francisco del Monte, which is not listed as a legislative district, was originally a pueblo owned by Franciscan missionary Fray Pedro Bautista. Additionally, the Diliman Quadrangle was planned to be the city center of Quezon City.

*Bago Bantay: Located at the west central part of the city, this place is known as a residential area at the back of SM North EDSA. It is composed of barangays Alicia, Ramon Magsaysay, Santo Cristo, and the northern part of Bagong Pag-asa. Bago-Bantay started as a small visita in the early 1930s under the jurisdiction of San Pedro de Bautista parish in San Francisco del Monte. This area mark as part of North EDSA portion from North Avenue and West Avenue stretches all the way to Congressional Avenue and Fernando Poe Jr. Avenue with Project 7.
*: Located at the southern part of the city, Cubao is the home of the Araneta City, a mixed-use township development that contains prominent shopping malls such as Ali Mall, Farmers Plaza and Gateway Mall and iconic landmarks such as the Smart Araneta Coliseum. The Cubao Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao.
*Diliman: Diliman is located at the center of Quezon City, the place where the city was originally established. The area is named for the Tagalog word for the medicinal fern species &quot;Stenochlaena palustris&quot;, Numerous national government offices are located in Diliman, as well as prominent colleges and universities such as the University of the Philippines Diliman, FEU–FERN College, and New Era University. The Diliman Quadrangle, which is bounded by the North, West, South (Timog) and East Avenues, is known for its hospitals, government edifices, and nightlife bars. Several streets in South Triangle and Barangay Laging Handa were named in honor of the 22 Boy Scouts who died in a plane crash &quot;en route&quot; to joining the 11th World Scout Jamboree. A memorial stands in the center of the roundabout at the intersection of Timog Avenue and Tomas Morato Avenue. The place was thus known as the &quot;Scout Area&quot;. Major commercial broadcasting media and television networks such as ABS-CBN and GMA have their headquarters within the Diliman Quadrangle. PTV, RPN, IBC, and PBS also hold headquarters in Diliman.
*Galas: The Galas-Santol District of Quezon City is located in its southwest border with the City of Manila. The barangays of Dona Imelda, Dona Josefa, Dona Aurora and Don Manuel, named after public figures who significantly contributed to the city&#x27;s early development, are located in this area. Barangays of Santo Nino, Santol and San Isidro serve as the border of Sampaloc and Santa Mesa in Manila. SM City Sta. Mesa lies at the end of the Araneta avenue set as the crossing border within the three cities of San Juan, Quezon City and Manila.
*La Loma: La Loma is located the southwestern portion of the city. It has five barangays along the vicinity of its main streets: N.S. Amoranto Avenue (Retiro) and A. Bonifacio Avenue. The district is famed as the birthplace of many popular Filipino culinary figures and establishments especially devoted to the lechon. The nearby La Loma Cemetery is named after this place.
*New Manila: New Manila is named after the City of Manila, since most of its residents are affluent families from the city who wished to escape the stress of living in the capital. It was formerly a part of San Juan before being carved out from its mother town to form Quezon City. Among its notable residents are the Hemady-Ysmael Family, the original landowner of New Manila, and Dona Narcisa de Leon, the matriarch of LVN Studios. It is also the birthplace of Eraño Manalo, the Second Executive Minister of Iglesia ni Cristo. New Manila is also known for Balete Drive, which a haunted place according to Filipino folklore where the spirit of a white lady haunts the road seeking help from passing drivers.
*Novaliches: Novaliches is the largest district in Quezon City, which made up almost all the northern portion of the city after Batasan Hills. It contains the La Mesa Watershed Reservation and its Dam and Reservoir where most of Metro Manila&#x27;s water supply came from. It was originally a part of Caloocan before being incorporated to Quezon City in 1948, when the latter was declared as the capital. Before the place was incorporated to Quezon City in 1948, Novaliches was already in the maps as early as 1864, having been organized by the Spanish as early as 1855, from the haciendas of Tala, Malinta, Piedad, and Maysilo. By 1856, it was its own municipality before being absorbed by Caloocan in 1901. Novaliches is still known by its historical boundaries. The whole of North Caloocan up to the banks of the Marilao River bordering Bulacan to the north, parts of the historic Polo section of Valenzuela to the west, and parts of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan to the upper reaches of Tungkung Mangga and the old Tala Leprosarium in the northeast and east, are still referred to as within the old enclave of Novaliches that many residents consider to this day.
*Project 1: Also known as Barangay Roxas or Roxas District. Barangay Roxas was the first housing project undertaken by the Philippine Homesite Housing Corporation in compliance with an Executive Order by President Manuel Roxas in 1948.

==Cityscape==
===Architecture===

The architecture in Quezon City features a wide variety of architectural styles, such as Art Deco, Brutalist, International Modern, Postmodern and Contemporary styles. The city also has numerous monuments and museums. When the city was created in 1939, Art Deco was the prevailing architectural style, moving forward from the colonial designs of Bahay na bato by the Spanish, and the Neoclassical style by the Americans. The choice of designing buildings in contemporary international style was intentional to show that the Philippines was moving forward since it was anticipating independence in 1945.

The Quezon Memorial Shrine, which was built from 1952 to 1978, was designed in Art Deco style. It became the city&#x27;s symbol and at its base was a museum and mausoleum dedicated to the late Manuel L. Quezon and his wife Aurora. When the city became the capital in 1948, a lot of government buildings transferred from Manila to Quezon City. Numerous government buildings were built during the terms of President Elpidio Quirino, Ramon Magsaysay, Carlos P. Garcia, Diosdado Macapagal and Ferdinand Marcos. However, it was only during the term of Marcos that began the &quot;Filipinization&quot; of architecture. Numerous government hospitals in the city such as the Lung Center of the Philippines, Philippine Heart Center, and the Kidney Center of the Philippines were built and regarded as &quot;designer&quot; hospitals. Traditional Filipino design motifs were incorporated in government buildings such as the Batasang Pambansa, which drew inspiration from the &quot;Bahay Kubo&quot; and the &quot;Bahay na bato&quot;. Most of the government buildings and structures built during the time of Marcos were associated with the &quot;edifice complex&quot; of the Marcoses.

===Master Plans===
In 1938, President Manuel L. Quezon made a decision to push for a new capital city. Manila was getting crowded, and his military advisors reportedly told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by naval guns in case of attack. The new city will be located at least away from Manila Bay, which is beyond the reach of naval guns. Quezon contacted William E. Parsons, an American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. He died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with Juan Arellano, engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital. The plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941.

The core of the new city was to be a Central Park, about the size of New York&#x27;s Central Park, and defined by the North, South (Timog), East and West Avenues. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a elliptical site, the focal point of the grand quadrangle. This was the planned location of a large Capitol Building to house the Philippine Legislature and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives. On either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been the new Malacañang Palace on North Avenue (site of the present-day Veterans Memorial Hospital), and the Supreme Court Complex along East Avenue (now the site of East Avenue Medical Center). The three branches of government were to be finally and efficiently located in close proximity to each other.
