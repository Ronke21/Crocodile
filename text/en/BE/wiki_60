<text>Ananda Kentish Muthu Coomaraswamy (, &quot;Āṉanta Kentiś Muthū Kumāracuvāmi&quot;; &quot;Ānanda Kumārasvāmī&quot;; 22 August 1877 − 9 September 1947) was a Ceylonese metaphysician, historian and a philosopher of Indian art who was an early interpreter of Indian culture to the West. He has been described as &quot;the groundbreaking theorist who was largely responsible for introducing ancient Indian art to the West&quot;.

==Life==
Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy was born in Colombo, British Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, to the Ceylon Tamil legislator and philosopher Sir Muthu Coomaraswamy of the Ponnambalam–Coomaraswamy family and his English wife Elizabeth Beeby. His father died when Ananda was two years old, and Ananda spent much of his childhood and education abroad.

Coomaraswamy moved to England in 1879 and attended Wycliffe College, a preparatory school in Stroud, Gloucestershire, at the age of twelve. In 1900, he graduated from University College London (UCL), with a degree in geology and botany. On 19 June 1902, Coomaraswamy married Ethel Mary Partridge, an English photographer, who then traveled with him to Ceylon. Their marriage lasted until 1913. Coomaraswamy&#x27;s field work between 1902 and 1906 earned him a doctor of science for his study of Ceylonese mineralogy, and prompted the formation of the Geological Survey of Ceylon which he initially directed. While in Ceylon, the couple collaborated on &quot;Mediaeval Sinhalese Art&quot;; Coomaraswamy wrote the text and Ethel provided the photographs. His work in Ceylon fueled Coomaraswamy&#x27;s anti-Westernization sentiments. After their divorce, Partridge returned to England, where she became a famous weaver and later married the writer Philip Mairet.

By 1906, Coomaraswamy had made it his mission to educate the West about Indian art, and was back in London with a large collection of photographs, actively seeking out artists to try to influence. He knew he could not rely on museum curators or other members of the cultural establishment – in 1908 he wrote &quot;The main difficulty so far seems to have been that Indian art has been studied so far only by archaeologists. It is not archaeologists, but artists ... who are the best qualified to judge of the significance of works of art considered as art.&quot; By 1909, he was firmly acquainted with Jacob Epstein and Eric Gill, the city&#x27;s two most important early Modernists, and soon both of them had begun to incorporate Indian aesthetics into their work. The curiously hybrid sculptures that were produced as a result can be seen to form the very roots of what is now considered British Modernism.

Coomaraswamy then met and married a British woman Alice Ethel Richardson and together they stayed on a houseboat in Srinagar in Kashmir. Commaraswamy studied Rajput painting while his wife studied Indian music with Abdul Rahim of Kapurthala. When they returned to England, Alice performed Indian song under the stage name Ratan Devi. Alice was successful and both went to America when Ratan Devi did a concert tour. While they were there, Coomaraswamy was invited to serve as the first Keeper of Indian art in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1917. The couple had two children, a son, Narada, and daughter, Rohini.

Coomaraswamy divorced his second wife after they arrived in America. He married the American artist Stella Bloch, 20 years his junior, in November 1922. Through the 1920s, Coomaraswamy and his wife were part of the bohemian art circles in New York City, Coomaraswamy befriended Alfred Stieglitz and the artists who exhibited at Stieglitz&#x27;s gallery. At the same time, he studied Sanskrit and Pali religious literature as well as Western religious works. He wrote catalogues for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and published his &quot;History of Indian and Indonesian Art&quot; in 1927.

After the couple divorced in 1930, they remained friends. Shortly thereafter, on 18 November 1930, Coomaraswamy married Argentine Luisa Runstein, 28 years younger, who was working as a society photographer under the professional name Xlata Llamas. They had a son, Coomaraswamy&#x27;s third child, Rama Ponnambalam (1929-2006), who became a physician and convert at age 22 to the Roman Catholic Church. Following Vatican II, Rama became a critic of the reforms and author of Catholic Traditionalist works. He was also ordained a Traditionalist Roman Catholic priest, despite the fact that he was married and had a living wife. Rama Coomaraswamy studied in England and then in India, learning Hindi and Sanskrit. Became a psychiatrist in the United States, he was an opponent of Pope John Paul II and remain a wider correspondent of mother Teresa of Calcutta, whose first healing attribution was recognized by John Paul II in 2002.

During his long career, Coomaraswamy was instrumental in bringing Eastern art to the West. While at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, he built the first substantial collection of Indian art in the United States. In 1933, Coomaraswamy&#x27;s title there changed from curator to Fellow for Research in Indian, Persian, and Mohammedan Art. 

After Coomaraswamy&#x27;s death, his widow, Doña Luisa Runstein, acted as a guide and resource for students of his work.

==Contributions==
Coomaraswamy made important contributions to the philosophy of art, literature, and religion. In Ceylon, he applied the lessons of William Morris to Ceylonese culture and, with his wife Ethel, produced a groundbreaking study of Ceylonese crafts and culture. While in India, he was part of the literary circle around Rabindranath Tagore, and he contributed to the &quot;Swadeshi&quot; movement, an early phase of the struggle for Indian independence. In the 1920s, he made discoveries in the history of Indian art, particularly some distinctions between Rajput and Moghul painting, and published his book &quot;Rajput Painting&quot;. At the same time, he amassed an unmatched collection of Rajput and Moghul paintings, which he took with him to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, when he joined its curatorial staff in 1917. Through 1932, from his base in Boston, he produced two kinds of publications: brilliant scholarship in his curatorial field but also graceful introductions to Indian and Asian art and culture, typified by &quot;The Dance of Shiva&quot;, a collection of essays that remain in print to this day. Deeply influenced by René Guénon, he became one of the founders of the Traditionalist School. His books and essays on art and culture, symbolism and metaphysics, scripture, folklore and myth, and still other topics, offer a remarkable education to readers who accept the challenges of his resolutely cross-cultural perspective and insistence on tying every point he makes back to sources in multiple traditions. He once remarked, &quot;I actually think in both Eastern and Christian terms—Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Pali, and to some extent Persian and Chinese.&quot; Alongside the deep and not infrequently difficult writings of this period, he also delighted in polemical writings created for a larger audience—essays such as &quot;Why exhibit works of art?&quot; (1943).

In his book &quot;The Information Society: An Introduction&quot; (Sage, 2003, p. 44), Armand Mattelart credits Coomaraswamy for coining the term &#x27;post-industrial&#x27; in 1913.

== Methodology ==
Coomaraswamy was a firm believer in the comparative method. The analysis of both texts and symbols across a wide variety of cultures and time periods allowed him to see below the surface of local interpretations and religious exclusivism to locate the bedrock of tradition. By tradition, he meant that which has been handed down from time beyond memory.
The folk has thus preserved, without understanding, the remains of old traditions that go back sometimes to the indeterminably distant past, to which we can only refer as “prehistoric”. Had the folk beliefs not indeed been once understood, we could not now speak of them as metaphysically intelligible, or explain the accuracy of their formulations.
His extensive knowledge of ancient languages allowed him access to primary sources and his understanding of metaphysics helped him discern the deeper meanings that other scholars often missed. Given the specialization and compartmentation of knowledge that was part of the Western academic tradition, his efforts were not always appreciated. He expressed some of his feelings in a letter to Graham Carey:
What the secular mind does is to assert that we (symbolists) are reading meaning into things that originally had none: our assertion is that they are reading out the meaning. The proof of our contention lies in the perfection, consistency and universality of the pattern in which these meanings are united.
His criticism of the academic world was centered around a number of related issues. First, the academic method, by itself, was ill-equipped to deal with the way in which ideas where transmitted in non-literate cultures, due to an over-reliance on written documentation. Too much was left out.
By “folklore” we mean the whole and consistent body of culture which has been handed down, not in books but by word of mouth and in practice, from time beyond the reach of historical research, in the form of legends, fairy tales, ballads, games, toys, crafts, medicine, agriculture, and other rites, and forms of social organization, especially those that we call “tribal.” This is a cultural complex independent of national and even racial boundaries, and of remarkable similarity throughout the world.
A second point of conflict was the obsessive tendency of Western scholarship to divide cultures, religions, and time periods into discrete categories in order to fit into academic organizational and mental structures.
It is equally surprising that so many scholars, meeting with some universal doctrine in a given context, so often think of it as a local peculiarity.
As a traditionalist, Coomaraswamy emphasized the continuity of culture. He was well aware of historical change but he felt that the connecting elements had been lost by the extreme emphasis placed on change and “progress”. Conflict between a new religion and an older one often obscured the commonalities that linked them.
The opposition of religion to folklore is often a kind of rivalry set up as between a new dispensation and an older tradition, the gods of the older cult becoming the evil spirits of the newer.
He pointed out that the Greek word &quot;daimon&quot;, which at root indicates something given, was synonymous with the Christian Holy Spirit, God&#x27;s gift of life. If Christian propagandists chose to emphasize the demonic at the expense of the &quot;daimon&quot; it was only to further their own cause. Ideas like this did not go over well with other scholars and his correspondence has its share of angry or condescending responses to his work which he deflected with a combination of erudition, tact, and humor.

A third issue that raised his ire was the racism inherent in the Western world&#x27;s criticism and misinterpretation of traditional and tribal cultures, attitudes tied closely to literacy and the attendant idea of progress.
It was possible for Aristotle, starting from the premise that a man, being actually cultured, may also become literate, to ask whether there is a necessary or merely an accidental connection of literacy with culture. Such a question can hardly arise for those to whom illiteracy implies, as a matter of course, ignorance, backwardness, unfitness for self-government: for you, unlettered people are uncivilized peoples and vice versa—as a recent publisher&#x27;s blurb expresses it: “The greatest force in civilization is the collective wisdom of a literate people.&quot;
Like Franz Boas and a handful of others, Coomaraswamy waged a constant war against racism with the press and academic world. He was a strong advocate for Indian independence and was pressured to leave England for publicly suggesting that Indians not fight in the First World War.

Unlike Rene Guenon and others who shared many of his understandings, Coomaraswamy was not content to describe traditional ideas from the inside out, in metaphysical terms alone.. He did not believe that science and metaphysics were in opposition, but were two different ways of looking at the world. 

Coomaraswamy was critical of the writings of Carl Jung and of Theosophy, which he believed distorted the meaning of traditional ideas. The comparative method has achieved a good deal of success in linguistics but its application to culture had rarely gone beyond mere documentation before Ananda Coomaraswamy.

== Traditional symbolism ==
One of Coomaraswamy&#x27;s most important contributions was in his study of the language of symbolism contained in images.
To have lost the art of thinking in images is precisely to have lost the proper linguistic of metaphysics and to have descended to the verbal logic of “philosophy.
His study of traditional symbols had taught him that symbols were meant to express &quot;ideas&quot; and not &quot;emotions&quot; and that a study of “styles” and “influences” would reveal little of significance.
An adequate knowledge of theology and cosmology is then indispensable to an understanding of the history of art, insofar as the actual shapes and structures of works of art are determined by their real content. Christian art, for example, begins with the representation of deity by abstract symbols, which may be geometrical, vegetable, or theriomorphic, and are devoid of any sentimental appeal whatever. An anthropomorphic symbol follows, but this is still a form and not a figuration; not made as though to function biologically or as if to illustrate a text book of anatomy or dramatic expression. Still later, the form is sentimentalised; the features of the crucified are made to exhibit human suffering, the type is completely humanised, and where we began with the shape of humanity as an analogical representation of the idea of God, we end with the portrait of the artist&#x27;s mistress posing as the Madonna and a representation of an all-too-human baby; the Christ is no longer a man-God, but the sort of man we can approve of.
In keeping with his traditionalist stance, he saw this process as one of gradual decay in which the human life world began to encroach gradually on the divine with an attendant growth of sentimentality and loss of meaning. He was fond of quoting the curator, John Lodge: “From the Stone Age until now, &quot;quelle dégringolade&quot;.”

Coomaraswamy spent a lot of his time documenting themes and images that appeared to be very old, given their widespread distribution. Major areas of study included:
* Solar symbolism
* Symbolism of the wheel
* The Flood story
* The “Water Cosmology” and the “Plant Style”
* Soma and the Water of Life
* Traditional cosmologies (the three worlds)
* The symbolism of snakes and reptiles
* The symbolism of birds and other “psychopomps” (soul carriers)
* The heavenly ladder
* The cosmic dome and the hole in the sky with its guardian figure
* The Thread-spirit (&quot;sutratman&quot;) doctrine that underlies the symbolism of the fiber arts
* The concept of ether and the symbolism of fire
* Divine bi-unity (male/female) as one
* The inverted tree and arboreal symbolism
* The Symplegades (Clashing Rocks) and the Coincidence of Opposites

Coomaraswamy observed these symbols in different cultures and time periods, both in religious writings and in folklore. He saw little opposition between religion and folklore. Folklore was transmitted in the vernacular as compared to the sacred languages in which scripture was delivered and interpreted. Folklore was less moralistic but its themes shared a common source with those of religion; Jack&#x27;s beanstalk was Jacob&#x27;s ladder. Religion was not “contaminated” by folklore but used it to express the same ideas in a more rationalized and moralized setting, just as Plato used myths to explain his philosophy.

The designs we found in Neolithic times were derived from older images. Thus the continuity of tradition reveals itself best in art, which expresses ideas. Even when religious philosophies developed with writing, a continuity of meaning could be observed often because the change was gradual and the old and the new existed side by side.
In the Vedas, the belief {that all life began in the “Waters”} appears in the form of an old popular theory, for which are substituted the successively more philosophical concepts of Space Cosmology, of a belief in the origin of the world in Non-being, in an origin of the world from Being, and finally in the conception of Brahman (the Absolute) as world-ground. The Water Cosmology, it is true, persists side by side with, and linked with these deeper views, even in post-Vedic literature; but it is typically not a creation of the Vedas and seems to belong to an even older stratum of ideas than that which is developed in the Vedas.
The ideas expressed by images were made explicit by writing, which allowed for a greater degree of abstraction and elaboration but since the concrete preceded the abstract, all philosophy started with images. In the absence of writing, the tribal cultures of the world have preserved a good deal of this older symbolism.

Coomaraswamy also maintained that traditional technologies (like the needle or the fire drill) were applications of metaphysical ideas, just as modern technology is an expression of scientific principles.
Primitive man knew nothing of a possible divorce of function and meaning: all his inventions were applied meaning.
The American art historian, Carl Schuster, who corresponded with Coomarawamy and learned much from him, would go on to identify some of the Paleolithic sources of this symbolism.

== Perennial philosophy ==

He was described by Heinrich Zimmer as &quot;That noble scholar upon whose shoulders we are still standing.&quot; While serving as a curator to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in the latter part of his life, he devoted his work to the explication of traditional metaphysics and symbolism. His writings of this period are filled with references to Plato, Plotinus, Clement, Philo, Augustine, Aquinas, Shankara, Eckhart, Rumi and other mystics. When asked how he defined himself foremost, Coomaraswamy said he was a &quot;metaphysician&quot;, referring to the concept of perennial philosophy, or &quot;sophia perennis&quot;.

Along with René Guénon and Frithjof Schuon, Coomaraswamy is regarded as one of the three founders of Perennialism, also called the Traditionalist School. Several articles by Coomaraswamy on the subject of Hinduism and the perennial philosophy were published posthumously in the quarterly journal &quot;Studies in Comparative Religion&quot; alongside articles by Schuon and Guénon among others.

Although he agrees with Guénon on the universal principles, Coomaraswamy&#x27;s works are very different in form. By vocation, he was a scholar who dedicated the last decades of his life to &quot;searching the Scriptures&quot;. He offers a perspective on the tradition that complements Guénon&#x27;s. He was extremely perceptive regarding aesthetics and wrote dozens of articles on traditional arts and mythology. His works are also finely balanced intellectually. Although born in the Hindu tradition, he had a deep knowledge of the Western tradition as well as a great expertise in, and love for, Greek metaphysics, especially that of Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism.

Coomaraswamy built a bridge between East and West that was designed to be two-way: among other things, his metaphysical writings aimed at demonstrating the unity of the Vedanta and Platonism. His works also sought to rehabilitate original Buddhism, as he believed that the distance (i.e. differences) between Buddhism and Hinduism was artificially created by Western Indologists. In his book, &quot;Hinduism and Buddhism&quot;, he wrote:

<text>In chemistry, a mixture is a material made up of two or more different chemical substances which can be separated by physical method. It is an impure substance made up of 2 or more elements or compounds mechanically mixed together in any proportion. A mixture is the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions or colloids.

Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances such as elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup. Despite the fact that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of the components. Some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical (mechanical or thermal) means. Azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually poses considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them).

==Characteristics of mixtures==
All mixtures can be characterized as being separable by mechanical means (e.g. , distillation, electrolysis, chromatography, heat, filtration, gravitational sorting, centrifugation). Mixtures differ from chemical compounds in the following ways:
* The substances in a mixture can be separated using physical methods such as filtration, freezing, and distillation.
* There is little or no energy change when a mixture forms (see Enthalpy of mixing).
*The substances in a mixture keep their separate properties. 
In the example of sand and water, neither one of the two substances changed in any way when they are mixed. Although the sand is in the water it still keeps the same properties that it had when it was outside the water.
* mixtures have variable compositions, while compounds have a fixed, definite formula.
* when mixed, individual substances keep their properties in a mixture, while if they form a compound their properties can change.

The following table shows the main properties and examples for all possible phase combinations of the three &quot;families&quot; of mixtures :

==Homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures==
Mixtures can be either &quot;homogeneous&quot; or &quot;heterogeneous&quot;: a mixture of uniform composition and in which all components are in the same phase, such as salt in water, is called homogeneous, whereas a mixture of non-uniform composition and of which the components can be easily identified, such as sand in water, it is called heterogeneous.

In addition, &quot;uniform mixture&quot; is another term for homogeneous mixture and &quot;non-uniform mixture&quot; is another term for heterogeneous mixture. These terms are derived from the idea that a homogeneous mixture has a uniform appearance, or only one phase, because the particles are evenly distributed. However, a heterogeneous mixture has constituent substances that are in different phases and easily distinguishable from one another. In addition, a heterogeneous mixture may have a uniform (e.g. a colloid) or non-uniform (e.g. a pencil) composition.

Several solid substances, such as salt and sugar, dissolve in water to form homogeneous mixtures or &quot;solutions&quot;, in which there are both a solute (dissolved substance) and a solvent (dissolving medium) present. Air is an example of a solution as well: a homogeneous mixture of gaseous nitrogen solvent, in which oxygen and smaller amounts of other gaseous solutes are dissolved. Mixtures are not limited in either their number of substances or the amounts of those substances, though in most solutions, the solute-to-solvent proportion can only reach a certain point before the mixture separates and becomes heterogeneous.

A homogeneous mixture is characterized by uniform dispersion of its constituent substances throughout; the substances exist in equal proportion everywhere within the mixture. Differently put, a homogeneous mixture will be the same no matter from where in the mixture it is sampled. For example, if a solid-liquid solution is divided into two halves of equal volume, the halves will contain equal amounts of both the liquid medium and dissolved solid (solvent and solute)

===Homogeneous mixtures===

====Solutions====

A solution is equivalent to a &quot;homogeneous mixture&quot;. In solutions, solutes will not settle out after any period of time and they cannot be removed by physical methods, such as a filter or centrifuge. As a homogeneous mixture, a solution has one phase (solid, liquid, or gas), although the phase of the solute and solvent may initially have been different (e.g., salt water).

====Gases====
Gases exhibit by far the greatest space (and, consequently, the weakest intermolecular forces) between their atoms or molecules; since intermolecular interactions are minuscule in comparison to those in liquids and solids, dilute gases very easily form solutions with one another. Air is one such example: it can be more specifically described as a gaseous solution of oxygen and other gases dissolved in nitrogen (its major component).

===Heterogeneous mixtures===
Examples of heterogeneous mixtures are emulsions and foams. In most cases, the mixture consists of two main constituents. For an emulsion, these are immiscible fluids such as water and oil. For a foam, these are a solid and a fluid, or a liquid and a gas. On larger scales both constituents are present in any region of the mixture, and in a well-mixed mixture in the same or only slightly varying concentrations. On a microscopic scale, however, one of the constituents is absent in almost any sufficiently small region. (If such absence is common on macroscopic scales, the combination of the constituents is a dispersed medium, not a mixture.) One can distinguish different characteristics of heterogeneous mixtures by the presence or absence of continuum percolation of their constituents. For a foam, a distinction is made between reticulated foam in which one constituent forms a connected network through which the other can freely percolate, or a closed-cell foam in which one constituent is present as trapped in small cells whose walls are formed by the other constituents. A similar distinction is possible for emulsions. In many emulsions, one constituent is present in the form of isolated regions of typically a globular shape, dispersed throughout the other constituent. However, it is also possible each constituent forms a large, connected network. Such a mixture is then called bicontinuous.

==Distinguishing between mixture types==
Making a distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures is a matter of the scale of sampling. On a coarse enough scale, any mixture can be said to be homogeneous, if the entire article is allowed to count as a &quot;sample&quot; of it. On a fine enough scale, any mixture can be said to be heterogeneous, because a sample could be as small as a single molecule. In practical terms, if the property of interest of the mixture is the same regardless of which sample of it is taken for the examination used, the mixture is homogeneous.

Gy&#x27;s sampling theory quantitatively defines the heterogeneity of a particle as:

:formula_1

where formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6 are respectively: the heterogeneity of the formula_7th particle of the population, the mass concentration of the property of interest in the formula_7th particle of the population, the mass concentration of the property of interest in the population, the mass of the formula_7th particle in the population, and the average mass of a particle in the population.

During sampling of heterogeneous mixtures of particles, the variance of the sampling error is generally non-zero.

Pierre Gy derived, from the Poisson sampling model, the following formula for the variance of the sampling error in the mass concentration in a sample:

:formula_10

in which &quot;V&quot; is the variance of the sampling error, &quot;N&quot; is the number of particles in the population (before the sample was taken), &quot;q&quot; &quot;i&quot; is the probability of including the &quot;i&quot;th particle of the population in the sample (i.e. the first-order inclusion probability of the &quot;i&quot;th particle), &quot;m&quot; &quot;i&quot; is the mass of the &quot;i&quot;th particle of the population and &quot;a&quot; &quot;i&quot; is the mass concentration of the property of interest in the &quot;i&quot;th particle of the population.

The above equation for the variance of the sampling error is an approximation based on a linearization of the mass concentration in a sample.

In the theory of Gy, correct sampling is defined as a sampling scenario in which all particles have the same probability of being included in the sample. This implies that &quot;q&quot; &quot;i&quot; no longer depends on &quot;i&quot;, and can therefore be replaced by the symbol &quot;q&quot;. Gy&#x27;s equation for the variance of the sampling error becomes:

:formula_11

where &quot;a&quot;batch is that concentration of the property of interest in the population from which the sample is to be drawn and &quot;M&quot;batch is the mass of the population from which the sample is to be drawn.

<text>Digital intermediate (DI) is a motion picture finishing process which classically involves digitizing a motion picture and manipulating the color and other image characteristics.

==Definition and overview==
A digital intermediate often replaces or augments the photochemical timing process and is usually the final creative adjustment to a movie before distribution in theaters. It is distinguished from the telecine process in which film is scanned and color is manipulated early in the process to facilitate editing. However the lines between telecine and DI are continually blurred and are often executed on the same hardware by colorists of the same background. These two steps are typically part of the overall color management process in a motion picture at different points in time. A digital intermediate is also customarily done at higher resolution and with greater color fidelity than telecine transfers.

Although originally used to describe a process that started with film scanning and ended with film recording, digital intermediate is also used to describe color correction and color grading and even final mastering when a digital camera is used as the image source and/or when the final movie is not output to film. This is due to recent advances in digital cinematography and digital projection technologies that strive to match film origination and film projection.

In traditional photochemical film finishing, an intermediate is produced by exposing film to the original camera negative. The intermediate is then used to mass-produce the films that get distributed to theaters. Color grading is done by varying the amount of red, green, and blue light used to expose the intermediate.

The digital intermediate process uses digital tools to color grade, which allows for much finer control of individual colors and areas of the image, and allows for the adjustment of image structure (grain, sharpness, etc.). The intermediate for film reproduction can then be produced by means of a film recorder. The physical intermediate film that is a result of the recording process is sometimes also called a digital intermediate, and is usually recorded to internegative (IN) stock, which is inherently finer-grain than original camera negative (OCN).

One of the key technical achievements that made the transition to DI possible was the use of 3D look-up tables, which could be used to mimic how the digital image would look once it was printed onto release print stock. This removed a large amount of guesswork from the film-making process, and allowed greater freedom in the colour grading process while reducing risk.

The digital master is often used as a source for a DCI-compliant distribution of the motion picture for digital projection. For archival purposes, the digital master created during the digital intermediate process can be recorded to very stable high dynamic range yellow-cyan-magenta (YCM) separations on black-and-white film with an expected 100-year or longer life. While still subject to the natural degradation of any analog chemical master, this archival format, long used in the industry prior to the invention of DI, was considered valuable for providing an archival medium that is independent of changes in digital data recording technologies and file formats that might otherwise render digitally archived material unreadable in the long term.

A &quot;film intermediate&quot; is an analog variation of a digital intermediate, where a project shot on digital video is printed onto film stock and transferred back to digital video to emulate film. The term was coined after it was used on the Oscar-winning 2012 short film &quot;Curfew&quot;. The process was also used on the films &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022).

==History==
Telecine tools to electronically capture film images are nearly as old as broadcast television, but the resulting images were widely considered unsuitable for exposing back onto film for theatrical distribution. Film scanners and recorders with quality sufficient to produce images that could be inter-cut with regular film began appearing in the 1970s, with significant improvements in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this time, digitally processing an entire feature-length film was impractical because the scanners and recorders were extremely slow and the image files were too large compared to computing power available. Instead, individual shots or short sequences were processed for visual effects.

In 1992, Visual Effects Supervisor/Producer Chris F. Woods broke through several &quot;techno-barriers&quot; in creating a digital studio to produce the visual effects for the 1993 release &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; It was the first feature film project to digitally scan a large number of VFX plates (over 700) at 2K resolution. It was also the first film scanned and recorded at Kodak&#x27;s just launched Cinesite facility in Hollywood. This project based studio was the first feature film to use Discreet Logic&#x27;s (now Autodesk) Flame and Inferno systems, which enjoyed early dominance as high resolution / high performance digital compositing systems.

Digital film compositing for visual effects was immediately embraced, while optical printer use for VFX declined just as quickly. Chris Watts further revolutionized the process on the 1998 feature film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, becoming the first visual effects supervisor for New Line Cinema to scan, process, and record the majority of a feature-length, live-action, Hollywood film digitally. The first Hollywood film to utilize a digital intermediate process from beginning to end was &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; in 2000 and in Europe it was &quot;Chicken Run&quot; released that same year.

The process rapidly caught on in the mid-2000s. Around 50% of Hollywood films went through a digital intermediate in 2005, increasing to around 70% by mid-2007. This is due not only to the extra creative options the process affords film makers but also the need for high-quality scanning and color adjustments to produce movies for digital cinema.

==Milestones==
* 1990: &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; – First feature-length film to be entirely recorded to film from digital files; in this case animation assembled on computers using Walt Disney Feature Animation and Pixar&#x27;s CAPS system.
* 1992: VFX Supervisor/Producer Chris F. Woods creates a VFX studio to produce the visual effects for the 1993 release &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot;. It was the first 35mm feature film to digitally scan a large number of VFX plates (over 700) at 2K resolution, as well as to output the finished VFX to 35mm negative at 2K.
* 1993: &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; – First film to be entirely scanned to digital files, manipulated, and recorded back to film at 4K resolution. The restoration project was done entirely at 4K resolution and 10-bit color depth using the Cineon system to digitally remove dirt and scratches and restore faded colors.
* 1998: &quot;Pleasantville&quot; – The first time the majority of a new feature film was scanned, processed, and recorded digitally. The black-and-white meets color world portrayed in the movie was filmed entirely in color and selectively desaturated and contrast adjusted digitally. The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite utilizing a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution and a MegaDef color correction system from UK Company Pandora International
* 1998: &quot;Zingo&quot; - The first feature film to use digital color correction via digital intermediate in its entirety. The work was performed at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen, using a Spirit Datacine to transfer the entire film to digital files at 2K resolution. The digital intermediate process was also used to perform a digital blowup of the film&#x27;s original Super 16 source format to a 35mm output.
* 1999: Pacific Ocean Post Film, a team led by John McCunn and Greg Kimble used Kodak film scanners &amp; laser film printer, Cineon software as well as proprietary tools to rebuild and repair the first two reels of the 1968 Beatles&#x27; film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; for re-release.
* 1999: &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; - Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) scanned the entirety of the visual effects-laden film for the purposes of digital enhancement and the integration of thousands of separately filmed elements with computer generated characters and environments. Outside of the approximately 2000 effects shots that were digitally manipulated, the remaining 170 non-effects shots were also scanned for continuity. However, after the digital shots were manipulated at ILM, they were filmed out individually and sent to Deluxe Labs where they were processed and color timed photochemically.
* 2000: &quot;Sorted&quot; - The first feature-length, color 35mm motion picture to fully utilize the digital intermediate process in its entirety from inception to completion. The film was produced at Wave Pictures&#x27; digital intermediate film facility in London, England. It was scanned at 2K resolution with 8 bits color depth per color / per pixel using a pin registered, liquid gate Oxberry 6400 Motion Picture Film Scanner and recorded onto Kodak 5242 color intermediate stock using MGI Celco Cine V Film Recorders. Digital visual effects and color correction were done using a &quot;Discreet Logic&quot; Inferno. &quot;Sorted&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2000.
* 2000: &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; – The first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first-run Hollywood film which otherwise had very few visual effects. The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite utilizing a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution, a Pandora International MegaDef system to adjust the color and a Kodak Lightning II recorder to output to film.
* 2000: &quot;Chicken Run&quot; was the first wide-release feature film in Europe to use the Digital Intermediate process, digitally storing and manipulating every frame of the film before recording back to film.
* 2001: &quot;Honolulu Baby&quot; by Maurizio Nichetti, the first live action feature film post produced in Europe to use the digital 2K Digital Intermediate process from a production filmed in Super 35mm, made by Rumblefish and Massimo Germoglio as a DI supervisor and film editor, edited on Avid, filmscanner with Spirit, CGI with Maya, graphics in AE, finishing and VFX in Inferno, filmrecording of the entire film on the internegative. printed on film.
* 2004: &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; – The first digital intermediate on a new Hollywood film to be done entirely at 4K resolution. Although scanning, recording, and color-correction was done at 4K by EFILM, most of the visual effects were created at 2K and were upscaled to 4K.
* 2005: &quot;Serenity&quot; - The first film to fully conform to Digital Cinema Initiatives specifications.
* 2008: &quot;Baraka&quot; – The first 8K resolution digital intermediate by FotoKem of a 65mm negative source for the October 2008 remastered DVD and Blu-ray Disc release. The scan produced 30 terabytes of data and took 12–13 seconds to scan each frame, for a total scan time of over three weeks.

<doc id="286080" wikidata="Q2743377" url="?curid=286080" title="The Alexandria Quartet">
<text>The Alexandria Quartet is a tetralogy of novels by British writer Lawrence Durrell, published between 1957 and 1960. A critical and commercial success, the first three books present three perspectives on a single set of events and characters in Alexandria, Egypt, before and during the Second World War. The fourth book is set six years later.

The work was reissued in one volume in 1962, and Durrell used the occasion to make &quot;numerous&quot; revisions. The 1962 edition represents his final thoughts.

As Durrell explains in his preface to &quot;Balthazar&quot;, the four novels are an exploration of relativity and the notions of continuum and subject–object relation, with modern love as the theme. The &quot;Quartet&quot;″s first three books offer the same sequence of events through several points of view, allowing individual perspectives of a single set of events. The fourth book shows change over time.

The four novels are:
:* &quot;Justine&quot; (1957)
:* &quot;Balthazar&quot; (1958)
:* &quot;Mountolive&quot; (1958)
:* &quot;Clea&quot; (1960).

In a 1959 &quot;Paris Review&quot; interview, Durrell described the ideas behind the &quot;Quartet&quot; in terms of a convergence of Eastern and Western metaphysics, based on Einstein&#x27;s overturning of the old view of the material universe, and Freud&#x27;s doing the same for the concept of stable personalities, yielding a new concept of reality.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot; number 70 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

Established on March 13, 1897, San Diego State University first began as the San Diego Normal School, and was initially meant to educate local women as elementary school teachers. It was located on a campus on Park Boulevard in University Heights (now the headquarters of San Diego Unified School District). It opened with 7 faculty members and 91 students; at first, the curriculum was limited to English, history and mathematics. In 1923, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College, &quot;a four-year public institution controlled by the California State Board of Education.&quot; 
By the 1930s the school had outgrown its original campus. In 1931 it moved to its current location on Montezuma Mesa at what was then the eastern edge of San Diego. In 1935, the school expanded its offerings beyond teacher education and became San Diego State College. In 1960, San Diego State College became a part of the California State Colleges system, now known as the California State University. In 1972, San Diego State College became California State University, San Diego, and finally, in 1974, San Diego State University (SDSU).

John F. Kennedy, then the president of the United States, gave the graduation commencement address at the then-San Diego State College on June 6, 1963. Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making SDSC the first California State College to award an honorary doctorate. In 1964, the event was registered as California Historical Landmark #798.

On May 29, 1964, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. addressed a near-capacity audience in the Open Air Theater. King discussed his vision for the future and called for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, then being debated in the Senate.

On August 15, 1996, there was a shooting that occurred at the engineering building. Three professors were killed by master&#x27;s degree student Frederick Martin Davidson. Three months later, a copycat threat flier was sent, with threats against professors and racial insults.

In April 2012, the 14th Dalai Lama spoke at SDSU&#x27;s Viejas Arena as part of his &quot;Compassion Without Borders&quot; tour.

After the departure of the San Diego Chargers for Los Angeles in 2017, SDSU endeavored to gain control of San Diego Stadium (then called Qualcomm Stadium) and surrounding city property. The stadium hosted the San Diego State Aztecs football team, connected to the SDSU main campus by SDSU Transit Center. The proposal, called SDSU West, was put to city voters in November 2017 where it won approval by 54%, beating out a competing commercial proposal called SoccerCity. Negotiations began for SDSU to purchase the property from the city of San Diego. On May 29, 2020, the city council gave conceptual approval to sell 135 acres, including the stadium, to SDSU for $88 million.

SDSU broke ground for a new 35,000-seat stadium in August 2020. The stadium, which opened in September 2022 as Snapdragon Stadium, hosts SDSU football games and various concerts and events. Snapdragon Stadium is also the home of San Diego FC of Major League Soccer (MLS) and San Diego Wave FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL). The entire $3.5 billion project, now known as SDSU Mission Valley, includes housing, office and retail space, hotels, and of parks and open space, including a river park on city property; it will be rolled out in phases over 15 years.

===University presidents===
SDSU has had ten presidents, two of whom served in an acting capacity. Several structures on the campus are named in past presidents&#x27; honor, such as Hardy Memorial Tower, Hepner Hall (integrated in the university&#x27;s logo), and Malcolm A. Love Library. In March 2017 President Hirshman announced his resignation for June 30, 2017; he will assume the position of president at Stevenson University in Maryland. Sally Roush was the interim president until January 31, 2018. On that date, the CSU Board of Trustees appointed Adela de la Torre to serve as the permanent President. De la Torre is the first woman to serve in the role on a permanent basis.

==Campus==
Several buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
* Scripps Cottage was finished in September 1931, funded with a donation of $6,000 from Ellen Browning Scripps matched with $5,000 from the state. It was the headquarters for the Associated Women Students and was used for meetings, women&#x27;s activities, and served as a lounge. On September 3, 1968, the building was moved to make room for the new school. It was used mainly as a conference and meeting building, and in 1993, began serving as a center for international students.
* The area next to Scripps Cottage is home to a campus famous turtle pond. While this pond is colloquially known among students as the turtle pond, the university actually intended it to be a Koi Pond only, and the turtles are unwelcome guests left abandoned by previous owners.
*Aztec Bowl, costing $500,000 to construct, was dedicated on October 3, 1936, before 7,500 people. The stadium was initially supposed to be expanded to 45,000 seats, but instead was only expanded once with 5,000 seats in 1948. 
*Viejas Arena (originally known as Cox Arena) was constructed over part of Aztec Bowl, opening in July 1997.
* The CalCoast Credit Union Open Air Theatre (formerly The Greek Bowl and the Open Air Theatre) was financed by the Works Progress Administration and the state for $200,000 and originally dedicated on May 3, 1941.
*Hepner Hall took on its current name on January 19, 1976, when the Montezuma Mesa building was renamed to honor Walter R. Hepner Hall. On May 1, 1977, the Humanities building was named after John Adams, a professor, administrator, and archivist. The Humanities-Social Sciences building was renamed in 1986 after geographer Alvena Storm and historian Abraham P. Nasatir.
*Peterson Gymnasium was finished in 1961.
*Hardy Memorial Tower, in the Mission Revival style, resembles a Spanish bell tower and is one of the most recognizable buildings on campus. The building housed the university&#x27;s first library, which featured murals painted by the Works Progress Administration.
* The WPA Mission Revival Communications building, Exercise and Nutritional Sciences building, Faculty-Staff Club, Life Sciences building and Annex, Little Theatre, Physical Plant Boiler Shop, and the Physical Science building are also listed on the National Register.
Other buildings on campus include:
* Malcolm A. Love Library acquired its 100,000th book on May 21, 1944. By the end of World War II it was adding about 8,000 books a year. In 1959, a . addition to the library was finished, but it was already deemed too small. In 1952, the library had 125,000 books, and state regulations required that old books be eliminated before new ones could be added. By 1965, there were more than 300,000 books housed in a library that could hold 230,000. This was ranked highest in state colleges in terms of library size. In the 1960s, construction of a new library began, which required the relocation of Scripps Cottage. The $8 million building was designed with . of space to accommodate one million books. In February 1971, the library opened, housing 700,000 books, and was named after President Malcolm A. Love for his popularity on campus and his role in bringing State to university status. Governor Ronald Reagan said the library would &quot;... serve as a lasting memorial to the man who led the college through its growing pains ... to one of the finest state colleges in California&quot;. The building was five stories high and was the largest building on campus. A four-story kinetic (and sound) sculpture entitled &quot;Hanging Discus&quot; by sculptor George Baker was specifically designed for the library and added to the interior staircase in November 1973.
* The Conrad Prebys Aztec Student Union (formerly Aztec Center) secured financing in 2010 and was completed in March 2014, replacing and approximately doubling in size from its former structure. The facility is the first student union in the United States to qualify for LEED Platinum distinction.
* The Parma Payne Goodall Alumni Center opened in October 2009, costing $11 million, and is home to the SDSU Alumni Association and the Campanile Foundation.
* Storm and Nasatir Halls opened in 2014. Originally built in 1957, the 137,700 square foot complex received a complete makeover to house eight academic departments from the College of Arts &amp; Letters, newly upgraded classrooms, faculty offices, research facilities, two large lecture halls, and a food service facility. Total cost for the construction neared $74 million, began in 2012, and was completed in 2014. Included in the opening were two new named facilities: Charles Hostler Hall (a 435-seat lecture auditorium) and the J. Keith Behner and Catherine M. Stiefel Auditorium (a 252-seat lecture hall). Storm Hall was named in honor of geography department professor Alvena Storm, who served as department chair, and on the faculty for over 40 years since 1926. Nasatir Hall was named for Abraham P. Nasatir, a professor emeritus of history who taught at SDSU for 46 years (1928–74) and was later internationally recognized for his research on California history, receiving four Fulbright Fellowships.
===Residence halls===
In 1937, Quetzal Hall, the first dormitory, opened for 40 women students and was located off campus. In 1968, the coed dorm Zura Hall was built, and more rooms were added later. Chapultepec Hall held 580 students when first built.

Today, the university owns and operates housing for over 4,100 students in residence halls and student apartments, fraternity row, and language and honors housing. There are over 15 dorms located on campus.

Approximately 63 percent of first-time freshmen live in on-campus housing, while about 14 percent of the overall student body resides in on-campus housing. SDSU offers themed living communities in the freshman and upperclassman housing, such as &quot;pathways for transfers&quot;, &quot;gender-neutral housing&quot;, and &quot;explore San Diego&quot;.

===Off-campus facilities===

====SDSU Georgia====

SDSU Georgia is a branch campus located in Tbilisi, Georgia, in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. SDSU Georgia is run in conjunction with three Georgian universities: Georgian Technical University (GTU), Ilia State University (ISU), and Tbilisi State University (TSU). The SDSU-Georgia branch campus is offering courses leading to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

==== Former branch campus locations ====
SDSU formerly operated a campus in North County, which was later converted into California State University San Marcos. In the South Bay, SDSU operated a campus in National City, California. This campus shared facilities with Southwestern College. The South Bay Campus is now closed indefinitely.
==Academics and student body==
The university awards 190 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 91 master&#x27;s degrees, and 30 doctoral degrees, including EdD, DPT, JD, AuD, DNP, and PhD programs in collaboration with other universities. SDSU also offers 26 different teaching credentials. The university offers more doctoral degrees than any other campus in the entire California State University, while also enrolling the largest student body of doctoral students in the system. In 2015, SDSU enrolled the most doctoral students in its entire history.

San Diego State University is consistently one of the most applied-to universities in the United States, receiving over 60,500 undergraduate applications (including transfer and first time freshman) for the fall 2018 semester and accepting nearly 21,300 for an admission rate of 35.1 percent across the university, the third-lowest admission rate in the 23-campus California State University system.

In Fall 2022, SDSU hit an all-time high enrollment record student body of nearly 37,000 and an alumni base of more than 400,000.

San Diego State University is a Hispanic-serving institution and is eligible to be designated as an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander serving institution (AANAPISI).

For fall 2021, SDSU received 24,993 applications for transfer admission and accepted 7,312 (an admission rate of 29.3 percent). The average incoming GPA for transfer students was 3.43.

Fall 2018 admitted freshmen had an average high school GPA of 3.93, average ACT score of 27.0, and average SAT score of 1,264 (out of 1,600; the writing section is not considered). 34.36 percent of the 68,897 freshman applicants were admitted for fall 2018.

The university reached its peak enrollment in 1987 with a student body of 35,945 FTES (Full-Time Equivalent Students), which made it at the time the largest university in California and the tenth largest university in the United States. Due to the overwhelming number of students and lack of facilities and majors, The California State University Board of Trustees voted to cap enrollment for SDSU at 33,000. However, in 1993 enrollment dropped to 26,800 (the lowest since 1973) due to a financial crisis. Nonetheless, enrollment has fluctuated through the years and rose back to nearly 35,000 (exceeding the cap) in 2008. For the fall 2016 semester, the university had a total enrollment of 33,778 students – approximately 29,046 undergraduate and 4,732 postgraduate – making it one of the largest research universities in the state of California. In fall 2013, SDSU had the most doctoral students enrolled in its history at 534 students, also the highest amount of doctorate-seeking students enrolled across the 23-campus CSU system.

==Athletics==


SDSU&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams are referred to as the &quot;Aztecs&quot;. The university currently sponsors six men&#x27;s and eleven women&#x27;s sports programs at the varsity level.

The first major sport on campus was rowing, but it initially had no coaches or tournaments. Other sports that developed early in the campus&#x27;s history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball. Early on, the school&#x27;s football program had such a limited selection of players that faculty had to be used to fill the roster. When the college merged with the junior college in 1921, the college became a member of the Junior College Conference. After the school won most of the conference titles in a variety of sports, the league requested that college leave out of fairness to the smaller schools. For its football program, the team outscored its opponents 249 to 52 in ten games, resulting in the first sales of season tickets in 1923. From 1925 to 1926, the college played as an independent. It then joined the Southern California Conference in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled. The college remained with the conference until 1939, when it joined the California Collegiate Athletic Association.

The basketball team reached and won multiple championship games during the 1930–1940s, including a conference title in 1931, 1934, 1937, and 1939. It reached the national championship in 1939 and 1940, losing in the final rounds. However, in 1941 the college returned and won the college&#x27;s first national title. In track, the team won conference titles in 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939. The football team won conference titles in 1936 and 1937, and the baseball team won three conference titles and placed second three times between 1935 and 1941.

In 1955, the Aztec Club was established and raised $20,000 a year by 1957. The club worked in increasing athletic scholarships, hiring better coaches, and developing the college&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic programs. In 1956, students approved through a vote of allowing a mandatory student activity fee, with a portion going to athletics. By the end of the decade the budget had doubled to $40,000. The campus&#x27;s most successful sports program during the 1950s was cross-country, when the team won eight straight conference titles and AAU regional titles and placed high in national competitions. Basketball teams ranged from last in the conference to multiple conference, regional, and national appearances. The football program had its first undefeated team in 1951, but in the last part of the decade earned the worst records in the school&#x27;s football program under the direction of head coach Paul Governali.

Under Governali, the campus&#x27;s football program suffered due to Governali&#x27;s policy of not recruiting players. To improve the program, Love hired in 1961 Don Coryell, who led the program win three consecutive championships (1966–68), and 104 wins, 19 losses, and 2 ties by the time he left SDSU. Coryell was assisted by John Madden, Joe Gibbs, and Rod Dowhower, among others. In Coryell&#x27;s first year, attendance at home games averaged 8,000 people, but by 1966 it had doubled to 16,000. This later jumped to 26,000–41,000 per game with the addition of the new San Diego Stadium. At some games, attendance was larger than at San Diego Chargers games. There were several undefeated seasons and many players broke records for most catches, touchdowns, and passing yards. In 1969, San Diego State College moved into NCAA Division I, leaving the California Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1972, Coyrell left to pursue coaching in the NFL.

Basketball also did well, with the 1967–68 team being ranked the number one college-level team in the nation, although it did not win a national title. The Aztecs also won the 1960 CCAA baseball title and multiple national championships throughout the 1960s in track, cross country, and swimming.

By 1970–71, the campus had 14 NCAA sports. The 1973 men&#x27;s volleyball team won the NCAA national championship which was the first NCAA national title since moving to Division I status.

SDSU competes in NCAA Division I (FBS). Its primary conference is the Mountain West Conference; its women&#x27;s rowing team competes in the American Athletic Conference, its women&#x27;s water polo team participates in the Golden Coast Conference, and its men&#x27;s soccer team is a single-sport member of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12). The ice hockey team competes in the ACHA with other western region club teams (www.sdsuhockey.com). The university colors are scarlet (red) and black, SDSU&#x27;s athletic teams are called the &quot;Aztecs&quot;, and its mascot is the Aztec Warrior, formerly referred to as &quot;Monty Montezuma&quot;.

As of 2021, athletes from the university have won 14 medals at the Olympic Games.

===Baseball===

The baseball team plays at Tony Gwynn Stadium, opened in 1997 and named after former SDSU baseball and basketball player, late baseball head coach, and Major League Baseball first ballot Hall of Fame inductee Tony Gwynn, who played his entire professional career with the San Diego Padres. The playing field is officially called Charlie Smith Field, after the longtime SDSU baseball head coach Charles R. Smith.

===Football===

The football team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). The team started playing at the new Snapdragon Stadium in 2022. The Fresno State–San Diego State football rivalry is between the Fresno State Bulldogs and San Diego State Aztecs. The winner of the game receives the &quot;Old Oil Can&quot; trophy.

===Basketball===
The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams play at Viejas Arena, opened in 1997, on the SDSU campus. The court is officially named Steve Fisher Court, after longtime SDSU basketball head coach Steve Fisher. Both teams practice at the Jeff Jacobs JAM Center, a basketball practice facility that opened on campus in 2015. The men&#x27;s Aztecs team began play in 1921 and have been to fifteen NCAA Division I tournaments and six NIT tournaments since joining NCAA Division I in 1969, the best finish coming recently in the 2023 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

===Soccer===

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams both play at the SDSU Sports Deck, a facility opened in 2000 that also hosts the women&#x27;s track and field team. The women compete in the Mountain West Conference while the men compete in the Pac-12 Conference. In 1987, the men&#x27;s team reached the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Championship final, losing to the Clemson Tigers.

===Volleyball===

The women&#x27;s volleyball team plays at Peterson Gymnasium&#x27;s Aztec Court. 
The former men&#x27;s volleyball team won the 1973 NCAA men&#x27;s volleyball tournament (SDSU&#x27;s first and only NCAA Division I national championship to date in any sport), but the program was disbanded in 2000 due to budgetary constraints and necessity to maintain compliance with Title IX regulations.

===Other sports===

* The SDSU Sports Deck is home to both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams as well as the women&#x27;s track &amp; field team.

The Associated Students organization of San Diego State University, in conjunction with the University of California, San Diego recreation, owns and operates the MBAC. The facility provides opportunities for many outdoor activities and water sports for SDSU students.

==Student life==

===Media, newspapers, and magazines===
Students began publishing &quot;The White and Gold&quot; in 1902, which was a literary magazine and newspaper. In 1913, a new newspaper was established entitled &quot;Normal News Weekly&quot;. The school newspaper &quot;Paper Lantern&quot; (&quot;Normal News Weekly&quot; was renamed after the addition of the junior college) became &quot;The Aztec&quot; in September 1925. It was later expanded to its current name, &quot;The Daily Aztec&quot; in fall 1959. The school&#x27;s annual yearbook was named &quot;Del Sudoeste&quot; (Spanish for &quot;of the southwest&quot;) in the early 1920s. &quot;The Koala&quot;, a comedy newspaper that is widely known around the San Diego State University area, is also distributed monthly on campus but is not directly connected to the school at the moment.

===Clubs===
Initial clubs that were first started on campus including the Debating Club, the Associated Student Body, YWCA, and in 1906, An Alumni Association. The oldest club on campus was the Rowing Association.

====Formula SAE====
&quot;Aztec Racing&quot; is SDSU&#x27;s Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) student chapter. Every year, SDSU engineering students design and construct an open wheel, open cockpit race car to Formula SAE specifications. Aztec Racing then competes against other universities&#x27; Formula SAE teams in an annual competition event, where the cars are raced against each other and judged on design. Attendance at Formula SAE competition is international, with several hundreds of schools competing each year. Students from other majors participate as well, frequently in the areas of management, promotion and other aspects of the project.

===Greek life===

Fraternities and sororities have been a part of the San Diego State University campus community for over a century. Today SDSU is home to many recognized Greek-letter organizations, most of which belonging to one of four university-sponsored governing councils.

The Interfraternity Council (IFC) currently consists of 15 active social fraternities. The College Panhellenic Association (CPA) is made up of 8 active social sororities.

=== LGBT-friendly campus ===
San Diego State University was recognized in 2016 among the best universities in the nation for supporting LGBT students. The Campus Pride Index recently ranked SDSU on its 2016 &quot;Best of the Best&quot; Top 30 list of LGBTQ-friendly colleges and universities. SDSU has been included in this ranking for the past seven years along with institutions like Princeton University and Cornell University.

SDSU was recognized in 2014 as one of 20 of the most Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender-friendly campuses in all of the U.S. The university attains this recognition through its welcome week LGBT reception, Safe Zone ally training, Big Gay BBQs, participating in Aids Walk San Diego and Pride San Diego, hosting an LGBT college fair, and holding a Lavender Graduation ceremony and several lecture series. The university is one of the few campuses in California that is home to the gay social fraternity, Delta Lambda Phi. Additionally, SDSU was the first university in California to offer a major in LGBT studies, while also offering a minor and graduate degree in the discipline. In 2014, SDSU opened a first-ever Pride Center at the former Student Organization Annex, with the mission to provide resources and help meet the needs and challenges of LGBT students.

===S Mountain===
On February 27, 1931, President Hardy permitted 500 students to paint rocks to form a white S on Cowles Mountain. The idea of &quot;S Mountain&quot; was created by the Council of Twelve and initially supported by Hardy. The giant S was lit at night for the opening football game of a season (performed by the freshman to build school spirit) along with pep rallies, and was repainted throughout its history. At the time, it was the largest collegiate symbol in the world. During World War II, the S was camouflaged to prevent it becoming a reference point for enemy bombing aircraft. It was returned to its normal state in April 1944. In the 1970s students stopped painting it and brush obstructed the symbol. After a 1988 brush fire it was exposed, and students repainted it. In fall 1997, a group of 100 volunteers climbed Cowles Mountain after dusk to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the school by using flashlights to once again outline the S on the side of the mountain. In 1990, a high school prank defaced the S to read as &quot;91&quot; in honor of their graduating class.

===School colors and history of the Aztec mascot===
The initial colors of the school were white and gold. When the junior college was added to the campus in 1921, its colors of blue and gold were merged, resulting in a blue, gold, and white color scheme. New colors were later chosen as gold and purple, until being replaced by scarlet and black on January 28, 1928.

The school&#x27;s prior nicknames for its mascot included &quot;Normalites&quot;, &quot;Professors&quot;, and &quot;Wampus Cats&quot;. The origin of the Aztec mascot is disputed among historians of the university but the first reported manifestation of the moniker concerned a student, Frederick Osenberg (Class of 1926), who came up with the idea of the San Diego State Aztecs while walking by the California Tower in Balboa Park, and became inspired by various murals of indigenous people from Latin America.” In 1925, the student body voted to adopt the Aztec moniker. The decision to choose the Aztec as a moniker was in conjunction with preliminary plans to move to a new campus and was done in unison with changing the name of the school newspaper to ‘The Aztec’ and featuring a yearbook with prominent Aztec symbols. The mascot transition was first mentioned in the January 21, 1925, edition of the school&#x27;s newspaper at the time, &quot;The Paper Lantern (1921–1925).&quot; In the article, &quot;State Adopts New Moniker For Athletes,&quot; opens with an improvised fight song, &quot;Rah for the Aztecs! What a name! What a name! Did you say Ash cans? Say I thought those cannibals were all dead! Whaddaya think this is? An Indian reservation? I&#x27;ll bet Hopis are responsible for this”. The reasoning behind the choice of mascot is also mentioned directly: &quot;We have been called Aztecs and will be called Aztecs in the future. The &#x27;name has&#x27; been used to denote a nation of semi-civilized inhabitants of central Mexico. What it will mean in the future remains for us to say. If we build an institution famous for its scholars, for its athletes, for its faculty; if we build a reputation for broadmindedness, for honesty, and for sportsmanship, these attributes will be incorporated into the same Aztecs. On the other hand – but there is no other hand in this picture. We are going to make the Aztecs mean all these finer things. Tradition will know Aztecs as something more than a tribe of semi-civilized inhabitants of Central Mexico...A name should stand for something more than a combination of letters. It should bear traditions, should call up thoughts of courage and fighting spirit. Such a tribe were the Aztecs. Noted for their fleetness, strength and bravery, they were seldom downed in physical encounters. The Aztecs are gone but their spirit and name remains, waiting all these years for State College to assume its burden. Vive la Aztec!”

In 1937, the artist, Donal Hord, completed &quot;Aztec&quot; for San Diego State College as an artistic representation of the Aztec mascot. The Depression-era Works Project Administration (WPA) partially funded the sculpture, created from a single 2.5-ton block of black diorite. The stone base was presented as a gift to the school by the class of 1937. In 2002, the sculpture was moved to the Prospective Student Center and in 2009, the SDSU Alumni Association installed a large concrete replica in the rotunda of the Parma Payne Goodall Alumni Center. The dedication ceremony included an elaborate dance circle with students, bare-chested, dressed in Plains Indian costumes. This style of performance was seen at the school throughout the mid-century.

The mascot continued to evolve and in 1941, for the first time, a student portrayed an Aztec in a football game skit. The character became known as Monty Montezuma. &quot;The first student to dress up as Monty was Art Munzig, who played the role during the opening football game of the 1941 season.  He and four scantily clad cheerleaders in Plains Indian costumes secretly hid in a makeshift teepee on the sidelines and emerged at halftime with Montezuma chasing the maidens down the track in front of the stands.&quot;

In 2000, the SDSU Associated Students’ University Council passed a resolution, backed by the Native American Student Alliance, that called for retiring the Aztec moniker and Montezuma mascot due to racism and culturally insensitivity and President Stephen Weber appoints a task force to make recommendations on the Aztec moniker and Montezuma mascot. This task force recommended updating logos and symbols to be culturally appropriate and historically accurate; defining Montezuma as an ambassador but not as a mascot; educating the university community on Aztec history and culture; and strengthening programs and events that support indigenous communities. The Monty Montezuma mascot was renamed the Ambassador Montezuma in 2002. Ambassador Montezuma debuts to speak on Aztec history and culture at events, but he is poorly received. To keep the tradition of the Montezuma mascot, Alumni form the Aztec Warrior Foundation and unveil an unofficial, more historically accurate Aztec Warrior representation. The school officially retired Ambassador Montezuma shortly after in 2003. During the same year, the Aztec Warrior becomes official through a referendum vote of students and alumni.

In 2010, SDSU briefly debuts Zuma, a jaguar mascot, at football games. The jaguar was retired in 2012.

Throughout the 2010s, the Aztec mascot has continued to be a point of controversy for the school. The last known vote regarding the mascot occurred in 2018. SDSU President Sally Roush appointed a 17-member Aztec Identity Task Force composed of students, faculty, staff, alumni and members at large and reports to the University Senate her decisions to continue the use of the Aztec identity. She also established a governing authority, chaired by the president, to ensure recognition of and reverence for the Aztec civilization become part of daily life at SDSU. President Roush made the decision to discontinue using the Aztec Warrior as a mascot, while retaining it as a &quot;Spirit Leader.&quot;

====Mascot controversy====
Like other mascots referencing historical tribes and cultures, the Aztec mascot has periodically been the topic of question. It was not cited as &quot;hostile and abusive&quot; by the NCAA in 2005. NCAA spokesman Erik Christianson said the organization &quot;accepted the findings from SDSU that it could not find any organized tribe or group related to Aztecs.&quot; Then President Weber explained his findings in a letter written on April 27, 2005, to the NCAA&#x27;s vice president for education services, Ron Stratten. &quot;As I mentioned in my letter on January 3, 2003, the Aztecs are not a Native American or American Indian culture,&quot; Weber wrote. &quot;However, the Aztecs are central to the cultural heritage of Mexico.&quot; However, the Aztec Warrior has drawn criticism.

Directly following the NCAA Native American mascot decision, the Native American Student Alliance (NASA) posted an official statement about the university mascot on their Facebook page. The statement said the mascot &quot;embodies the existence of institutionalized racism.&quot; A student group leader at the time was quoted voicing concern about the impact of utilizing stereotypical Native clothes, breathing fire and using sacred objects to whip up the crowd. These concerns were also vocalized by NASA in their official statement, where they voiced concern about the impact of the mascot on campus life after a 2009 party hosted by the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, with the theme “Cowboys and Nava-hoes.&quot; Although the school placed the fraternity on probation, President Hirshman&#x27;s statement about cultural appropriation drew attention to &quot;all of the performances of racialized stereotypes by faculty and students, baton twirlers in feathered headdresses, students dressed as imagined Indians, faux ceremonies, chants, songs, the names of the dorms, the names of the rooms of the new student union, t-shirts and banners proclaiming &#x27;We Are Aztecs&#x27;.&quot;

Other points of contention have included worry that the mascot teaches the mistaken idea that Aztecs were a local tribe rather than living in Mexico 1,000 miles away.

The SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) continues to support removal of the mascot in an official statements made to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach. Although that resolution was rejected by the SDSU Associated Students, the University Senate, which represents the administration, faculty, staff and students, had voted to phase out the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior.

In May 2021, the senate of the university opted a vote for commission to replace the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior for at least two animals of the Kumeyaay heritage. The commission would be working alongside local tribe leaders for the decisions leading up to a final replacement mascot.

==Incidents==
===1996 campus shooting===

A shooting occurred on campus on August 15, 1996. A 36-year-old graduate engineering student, while apparently defending his thesis, shot and killed his three professors, Constantinos Lyrintzis, Cheng Liang, and D. Preston Lowrey III, at San Diego State University. The shooter, who was suffering from certain mental problems, was convicted on July 19, 1997, and was sentenced to life in prison. As a memorial, tables with a plaque with information about each victim have been placed adjacent to the College of Engineering building.

===2008 student drug arrests===

On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced the arrests of 96 individuals, of whom 33 were San Diego State University students, on a variety of drug charges in a year-long narcotics sting operation dubbed Operation Sudden Fall. It was originally reported that 75 of the arrested were students, but the inflated number included students who had been arrested months earlier, in some cases for simple possession. The bust, which was the largest in the history of San Diego County, drew a mixed reaction from the community.

===2014 sexual assault allegation===
In late 2014, SDSU began an &quot;It&#x27;s on Us&quot; campaign to combat an alarming pattern of sexual violence. In the fall 2014 semester, there were 14 sexual assault allegations reported on or around the College Area. In early 2015, SDSU was found to have wrongfully accused a male foreign exchange student of sexual assault during the fall 2014 semester and allegedly failing to afford him due process. The student&#x27;s name was released in a campus-wide email immediately upon his arrest and he was quickly expelled from the university. Alexa Romano, the female student who made the accusation, later admitted to not being truthful about the alleged incident. The male student later successfully sued the university.

==Notable alumni and faculty==
San Diego State University has over 400,000 alumni worldwide. The university is one of the top producers of U.S. Student Fulbright Scholars in the nation.

<text>Levy Patrick Mwanawasa (3 September 1948 – 19 August 2008) was the third president of Zambia. He served as president from January 2002 until his death in August 2008. Mwanawasa is credited with having initiated a campaign to rid the corruption situation in Zambia during his term. Prior to Mwanawasa&#x27;s election, he served as the fourth vice-president of Zambia from November 1991 to July 1994, whilst an elected Member of Parliament of Chifubu Constituency.

== Early life and legal career==
Mr. Mwanawasa was born in Mufulira, Northern Rhodesia, as the second of 10 children. He held a law degree from the University of Zambia. He worked in private law firms from 1974 until 1978 when he formed his own firm: Mwanawasa &amp; Company. In 1985, Mwanawasa served as Solicitor General in the Zambian government but he went back to private practice in 1986.

In 1989, he led the legal defence team for Lt. Gen Christon Tembo, who was accused by the Kenneth Kaunda government of conspiracy to overthrow the government, which was judged as an act of treason worthy of the death penalty; Tembo won the case against the state, and Mwanawasa&#x27;s fame among the anti-Kaunda opposition grew. After Frederick Chiluba was elected as president, he appointed Mwanawasa as vice-president in November 1991. Mwanawasa left his firm in March 1992.

== Accident ==
Before his party&#x27;s convention in 1990, Mwanawasa was widely tipped to become the president of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), but he declined the overture, citing his young age and inexperience. He opted instead to stand as a member of parliament for Chifubu and won with an overwhelming majority of the popular vote.

On 8 December 1991 Mwanawasa was involved in a serious traffic accident in which his aide died on the spot. He suffered multiple body injuries and was flown to Johannesburg, South Africa for medical treatment. He remained hospitalised for three months. A lasting effect of the accident was his noticeably slurred speech. A commission of inquiry was set up to investigate who was responsible for the alleged assassination attempt.

== Politics ==
Mwanawasa served as vice-president until he resigned in July 1994. In 1996 he unsuccessfully challenged Chiluba for the presidency of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy. After the loss, Mwanawasa retired from politics until the 2001 election.

== 2001 election ==
In August 2001, the National Executive Committee of MMD elected Mwanawasa as its presidential candidate for the 2001 election. He won the election, held on 27 December 2001, with 29% due to Zambia&#x27;s first past the post system, beating 10 other candidates including two other former vice-presidents (Godfrey Miyanda and Gen. Christon Tembo); Anderson Mazoka came in a close second with 27%, according to official results. Mwanawasa took office on 2 January 2002. However, the results of the elections were disputed by main opposition parties, including Mazoka&#x27;s United Party for National Development. Some domestic and international election monitors cited serious irregularities with the campaign and election, including flawed voter registration, unequal and biased media coverage, and the MMD&#x27;s improper use of state resources. In January 2002, three opposition candidates petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn Mwanawasa&#x27;s victory. While the court agreed that the poll was flawed, it ruled in February 2005 that the irregularities did not affect the results and declined the petition.

== First term as president ==
In February 2002, Mwanawasa&#x27;s government filed defamation charges against &quot;The Post&quot; editor Fred M&#x27;membe and opposition lawmaker Dipak Patel for an article in which M&#x27;membe quoted Patel as calling Mwanawasa a &quot;cabbage&quot;, an apparent reference to his injuries.

However, in a move Mwanawasa described as an attempt to promote &quot;national reconciliation&quot;, Mwanawasa appointed a number of opposition lawmakers to his cabinet in February 2003, including Patel of the FDD as Minister of Trade, Commerce, and Industry, and Sylvia Masebo of the ZRP as Local Government Minister. However, Godfrey Miyanda, himself also belonging to the opposition, opposed the move and threatened to file a lawsuit over it.

In January 2005, Mwanawasa apologised to the nation for failing to tackle Zambian poverty. About 75% of the country&#x27;s population lived on less than $1 a day, the United Nations&#x27; indicator of absolute poverty.

He was elected as president of the MMD for a five-year term in 2005.

== 2006 election ==
Mwanawasa ran for a second term in the presidential election held on 28 September 2006. Michael Sata of the Patriotic Front was considered his main challenger. His re-election was confirmed on 2 October; according to official results, he received 42.98% of the vote. He was sworn in for another term on 3 October. A few days later, he named a new cabinet and appointed Rupiah Banda as vice-president.

== Policies ==

Foreign investors liked Mwanawasa, owing partly to his anti-corruption drive. During his presidency, Zambia received foreign investment. The main driver of economic growth was minerals. Mwanawasa&#x27;s policies helped to lower inflation and spread some benefits to the poor. Tourists and white farmers diverted from Zimbabwe and helped Zambian economy. Mwanawasa turned the Zambian town of Livingstone, near Victoria Falls, into a tourist hub. Zambia received a relatively large amount of aid and debt relief because of liberalisation and Mwanawasa&#x27;s &quot;stolid efforts&quot;. Overall, economic growth increased to about 6% per year.

Mwanawasa criticised President Robert Mugabe of neighbouring Zimbabwe. Mwanawasa was one of the first African leaders to publicly do so. When Mwanawasa died, Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was among the first to publicly express grief.

Mwanawasa sold off Konkola Copper Mines to Vedanta for $25m despite an initial asking price of $400m. An amount (i.e. $25m) the company made back in around 3 months and was later making a minimum of $500m in profit per year despite its environmental pollutions of the local community.

Mwanawasa was open to accepting climate immigrants from Kiribati into Zambia, telling Anote Tong that the country had &quot;plenty of room,&quot; but a deal was not finalized.

== Health ==
In April 2006, Mwanawasa experienced a mild stroke.

On 29 June 2008, while in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for an African Union summit, Mwanawasa was hospitalised due to a second stroke. On 1 July, International SOS evacuated him by air ambulance to France for further treatment. The head of the Egyptian hospital to which Mwanawasa was taken said that the doctors there had stopped the brain haemorrhage and that he was in a semi-comatose state. Vice-President Banda said that his condition was stable, and Minister of Information Mike Mulongoti noted that Mwanawasa had previously suffered from hypertension; Mulongoti also said that Mwanawasa was a &quot;very hard working man&quot; and said that this may have been a factor.

Due to Mwanawasa&#x27;s incapacitation, Banda became acting president.

=== Death reports ===
On 3 July 2008 news outlets began reporting that Mwanawasa had died in a Paris hospital due to his stroke. The story originated at the Johannesburg-based 702 Talk Radio, which cited Malone Zaza, who claimed to be the head of protocol at Zambia&#x27;s High Commission in Pretoria, South Africa; however, the commission denied having someone employed at the embassy with that name. Mulongoti, speaking for the government, said the news of Mwanawasa&#x27;s death was &quot;false,&quot; and he urged the South African media to show more restraint in its reporting. As the reports were spreading, South African President Thabo Mbeki called for a moment of silence in Mwanawasa&#x27;s memory; the South African government quickly expressed regret over this misunderstanding and expressed Mbeki&#x27;s hopes for Mwanawasa&#x27;s recovery.

=== Treatment in France ===
Mwanawasa was hospitalised at the Percy Military Hospital in Clamart, near Paris. In a statement on 7 July 2008, Banda said that Mwanawasa &quot;remain[ed] in a stable condition&quot; but had to undergo surgery, which Banda described as minor, to correct a breathing problem. Banda said on 8 July that this operation was successful. On 11 July, Banda said that Mwanawasa&#x27;s condition was stable and that his doctors were &quot;satisfied with [his] current status&quot;.

Benny Tetamashimba, the MMD&#x27;s chairman for Information and Publicity, subsequently said that the MMD &quot;should begin looking for a successor&quot; to Mwanawasa as president of the MMD. Mulongoti, speaking on state radio on 14 July, said that Tetamashimba&#x27;s suggestion did not represent the government&#x27;s views. United Party for National Development leader Hakainde Hichilema said that Mwanawasa&#x27;s incapacitation had paralysed the functioning of the government. On 15 July, Patriotic Front leader Michael Sata questioned the official claims about Mwanawasa&#x27;s health, and he called for a team of doctors to be sent by the Cabinet to examine Mwanawasa; this team would then disclose Mwanawasa&#x27;s actual condition. On 17 July, the MMD announced that Tetamashimba was facing potential disciplinary action, including the possibility of expulsion from the party. Tetamashimba argued that he had been misunderstood. He also said that Mwanawasa&#x27;s condition was improving and that he was &quot;responding to treatment&quot;, while asserting that the government was functioning smoothly and criticising the opposition call for a team of doctors to report on Mwanawasa&#x27;s health.

Banda gave another update of Mwanawasa&#x27;s condition on 24 July, saying that he was making &quot;steady progress … in his recovery&quot;. Skepticism regarding Banda&#x27;s optimistic updates was reportedly widespread. Minister of Health Brian Chituwo, speaking before the National Assembly on 8 August, said that Mwanawasa&#x27;s &quot;healing process will indeed be long&quot; due to the &quot;serious nature of [his] illness&quot;.

=== Death ===
Vice-President Banda said on 18 August that Mwanawasa&#x27;s condition had suddenly deteriorated and urgent medical intervention was necessary. The intervention was successful, according to Banda, but Mwanawasa remained in serious condition. On 19 August, a family member who wished to remain anonymous stated that Mwanawasa had died early that morning. The news of Mwanawasa&#x27;s death was confirmed by Banda through a television broadcast on the government-owned Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). He informed the nation that Mwanawasa had died that morning at 10:30 (8:30 GMT) at the Percy Military Hospital in Paris. Expressing &quot;immense grief and deep sorrow&quot;, Banda declared national mourning for seven days and urged Zambians to &quot;remain calm and mourn our President with dignity&quot;. The mourning period was extended to 21 days on 21 August. He is the first President of Zambia to die in office.

=== Reactions to death ===
The Patriotic Front&#x27;s Michael Sata expressed sadness and said that Mwanawasa&#x27;s death was a &quot;national disaster&quot;, urging Zambians to remain calm. The &quot;Zambia Daily Mail&quot;, a state-owned newspaper, said that his death marked &quot;a dark day for Zambia&quot; and had left Zambians &quot;shell-shocked and grief-stricken&quot;. As the country went into mourning, with flags flying at half-staff, the National Assembly session that had been in progress was indefinitely suspended; a strike by doctors was also suspended, and sporting matches were cancelled, all social events, weddings and birthday parties, were also cancelled. Joyous music in Zambian homes and bars was not heard during the mourning period. This gesture was later noted by the media as proof of the people&#x27;s love for their president. Former president Kenneth Kaunda paid tribute to Mwanawasa, saying that he was &quot;a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honour. … He observed the rule of law and he gallantly fought graft in all its forms. … We have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country.&quot;

=== Funeral ===
Acting president Banda announced state funeral arrangements for Mwanawasa on 21 August. According to this programme, after Mwanawasa&#x27;s body was returned to Zambia, it would first lie in state at Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka, the capital. The body would then be moved to different provincial capitals from 25 to 29 August, after which it would again lie in state at Mulungushi International Conference Centre until 2 September. His burial, planned for 3 September, was intended to coincide with his birthday; Mwanawasa would have turned 60 years old on that date.

Mwanawasa&#x27;s body arrived in Lusaka from France aboard a French military aircraft on 23 August. It was received with full military honours; Banda and Kaunda were present for the ceremony, which featured a 21-gun salute and jet fighter planes in the sky. It was then taken to all provincial capitals of Zambia, where members of the public had an opportunity to pay their respects. The body was accompanied by both the opposition and the ruling party leaders beside the first family during the tour.

The burial of Mwanawasa occurred on 3 September at Embassy Park opposite the Zambian Cabinet Office. The funeral was attended by heads of 14 African states, including Mbeki, Zimbabwe&#x27;s Robert Mugabe, and Tanzania&#x27;s Jakaya Kikwete. In her eulogy at the funeral, Maureen Mwanawasa said of her husband: &quot;Typical of you, you died on duty. You died a sad man as no one seemed to appreciate your sacrifices. Had you been with us today, I am sure these accolades could have made you happy.&quot;

==== International reactions ====

== Personal life ==
Mwanawasa married Maureen Mwanawasa on 7 May 1987, and they remained married until his death. He had seven children: Miriam, Patrick, Lorna, Chipokota Mwanawasa, Matolo, Lubona and Ntembe. His wife was a baptised member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses but has since been disfellowshiped because of her active role in politics. It is against the faith of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses to take part or sides in politics.

He became Baptist in 2005 and was baptized at Twin Palm Baptist Church in Lusaka.

In September 2007, Mwanawasa travelled to Arkansas in the United States to give a speech at Harding University in Searcy and received an honorary doctorate from the college. While in Arkansas, he addressed students and press at the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service about social, economic, and political development in Zambia and the region with specific attention paid to HIV/AIDS in Africa and President Mugabe of Zimbabwe.

<doc id="286096" wikidata="Q848620" url="?curid=286096" title="Rover Company">
<text>The Rover Company Limited was a British car manufacturing company originally founded in 1878, beginning car manufacturing in 1904. It primarily operated from its base in Solihull, Warwickshire. Rover also manufactured the Land Rover series from 1948 onwards, and created the Range Rover in 1970, which went on to become its most successful and profitable product. Land Rover eventually became a separate company and brand in its own right.

Rover was bought by Leyland Motors in 1967, which had already acquired Standard-Triumph seven years earlier. Initially, Rover maintained a level of autonomy within the Leyland conglomerate, but by 1978, Leyland – by then British Leyland (BL) – had run into severe financial difficulties and had been nationalized by the British Government. Most of the assets of the former Rover Company were moved into a new BL subsidiary named &quot;Land Rover Ltd&quot; whilst the &quot;Rover&quot; marque itself continued to be used on other BL products which relied largely on Honda engineering. Nevertheless, Rover ultimately became the most prolific brand within BL and gave its name to the entire conglomerate in the form of the Rover Group in 1986, of which MG, Mini and Land Rover remained a part until the Rover Group was broken up by BMW in 2000.

Currently, the Rover marque is the dormant property of the Rover Company&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; successor – Jaguar Land Rover (owned by Tata Motors), which still operates out of Rover&#x27;s Solihull plant.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The company was founded by John Kemp Starley and William Sutton in 1878. Starley had previously worked with his uncle, James Starley (father of the cycle trade), who began by manufacturing sewing machines and switched to bicycles in 1869.

The first product of the new company was a tricycle manufactured by Starley &amp; Sutton Co. of Coventry, England, in 1883. 

In the early 1880s bicycles were the relatively dangerous penny-farthings and high-wheel tricycles. J.K. Starley made history in 1885 by producing the Rover safety bicycle—a rear-wheel-drive, chain-driven cycle with two similar-sized wheels, making it more stable than the previous high-wheel designs. Cycling Magazine said the Rover had &quot;set the pattern to the world&quot;; the phrase was used in their advertising for many years. Starley&#x27;s Rover is usually described by historians as the first recognisably modern bicycle.

In 1889, the company became J.K. Starley &amp; Co. Ltd., and in the late 1890s, the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. The words for &quot;bicycle&quot; in Polish (&quot;rower&quot;) and Belarusian (ро́вар, &quot;rovar&quot;) are derived from the name of the company. The word ровер (&quot;rover&quot;) is also used in many parts of western Ukraine.

Rover started building motorcycles then cars using their Viking longship badge from 1904.

=== Rover motorcycles ===
In 1899 John Starley imported some of the early Peugeot motorcycles from France in for experimental development. His first project was to fit an engine to one of his Rover bicycles. Starley died early in October 1901 aged 46 and the business was taken over by entrepreneur H. J. Lawson.

The company developed and produced the &quot;Rover Imperial&quot; motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5 hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and &#x27;springer&#x27; front forks which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their &#x27;safety bicycle&#x27; but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned to develop a new 3.5 hp 500 cc engine with spring-loaded tappets, a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted tooth drive chain. It had a Brown and Barlow carburettor and Druid spring forks. This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.

In 1913 a &#x27;TT&#x27; model was launched with a shorter wheelbase and sports handlebars. The &#x27;works team&#x27; of Dudley Noble and Chris Newsome had some success and won the works team award.
Rover supplied 499 cc single-cylinder motorcycles to the Russian Army during the First World War. The company began to focus on car production at the end of the war, but Rover still produced motorcycles with 248 cc and 348 cc Rover overhead valve engines and with JAP engines, including a 676 cc V-twin. In 1924 Rover introduced a new lightweight 250 cc motorcycle with unit construction of engine and gearbox. This had lights front and rear as well as a new design of internal expanding brakes.

Poor sales of their motorcycles caused Rover to end motorcycle production and concentrate solely on the production of motor cars. Between 1903 and 1924 Rover had produced more than 10,000 motorcycles.

===Early Rover cars===

In 1888, Starley made an electric car, but it was never put into production.

Three years after Starley&#x27;s death in 1901, and H. J. Lawson&#x27;s subsequent takeover, the Rover company began producing automobiles with the two-seater Rover Eight to the designs of Edmund Lewis, who came from Lawson&#x27;s Daimler. Lewis left the company to join Deasy in late 1905. 
He was eventually replaced by Owen Clegg, who joined from Wolseley in 1910 and set about reforming the product range. Short-lived experiments with sleeve valve engines were abandoned, and the 12hp model was introduced in 1912. This car was so successful that all other cars were dropped, and for a while, Rover pursued a &quot;one model&quot; policy. Clegg left in 1912 to join the French subsidiary of Darracq and Company London.

During the First World War, they made motorcycles, lorries to Maudslay designs, and, not having a suitable one of their own, ambulances to a Sunbeam design.

===Restructure and reorganisation===
The business was not very successful during the 1920s and did not pay a dividend from 1923 until the mid-1930s. In December 1928 the chairman of Rover advised shareholders that the accumulation of the substantial losses of the 1923–1928 years together with the costs of that year&#x27;s reorganisation must be recognised by a reduction of 60 per cent in the value of capital of the company.

During 1928 Frank Searle was appointed managing director to supervise recovery. Searle was by training a locomotive engineer with motor industry experience at Daimler and, most recently, had been managing director of Imperial Airways. 
On his recommendation Spencer Wilks was brought in from Hillman as general manager and appointed to the board in 1929. That year, Searle split Midland Light Car Bodies from Rover in an effort to save money and instructed Robert Boyle and Maurice Wilks to design a new small car.

This was the Rover Scarab with a rear-mounted V-twin-cylinder air-cooled engine announced in 1931, a van version was shown at Olympia, but it did not go into production. During this time the Rover 10/25 was introduced, with bodies made by the Pressed Steel Company. This was the same body as used on the Hillman Minx. Prior to this time Rover had been a great supporter of the very light Weymann bodies that went suddenly out of fashion with the demand for shiny coachwork and more curved body shapes. Weymann bodies remained in the factory catalogue until 1933.

Frank Searle and Spencer Wilks set about reorganising the company and moving it upmarket to cater for people who wanted something &quot;superior&quot; to Fords and Austins. In 1930 Spencer Wilks was joined by his brother, Maurice, who had also been at Hillman as chief engineer. Spencer Wilks was to stay with the company until 1962, and his brother until 1963.

The company showed profits in the 1929 and 1930 years but with the economic downturn in 1931 Rover reported a loss of £77,529. 1932 produced a loss of £103,000 but a turn around following yet more reorganisation resulted in a profit of £46,000 in 1933. The new assembly operations in Australia and New Zealand were closed.

Frank Searle left the board near the end of the calendar year 1931, his work done.

Building on successes such as beating the Blue Train for the first time in 1930 in the Blue Train Races, the Wilks Brothers established Rover as a company with several European royal, aristocratic, and governmental warrants, and upper-middle-class and star clients.

===Second World War and gas turbines===

In the late 1930s, in anticipation of the potential hostilities that would become the Second World War, the British government started a rearmament programme, and as part of this, &quot;shadow factories&quot; were built. These were paid for by the government but staffed and run by private companies. Three were run by Rover: one, at Acocks Green, Birmingham, started operation in 1937, a second, larger one, at Solihull, started in 1940 and the third, at Drakelow Tunnels, Kidderminster, started in 1943. All three were employed making aero engines and airframes. The original main works at Helen Street, Coventry, was severely damaged by bombing in 1940 and 1941 and never regained full production.

In early 1940, Rover was approached by Frank Whittle to do work for Whittle&#x27;s company, Power Jets. This led to a proposal from Power Jets in which Rover would put forward £50,000 of capital in exchange for shares in Power Jets. Rover contacted the Air Ministry (AM) regarding the proposal, which ultimately led to an arrangement between Rover and former Power Jets contractor British Thomson-Houston (BTH) to develop and produce Whittle&#x27;s jet engine. The Air Ministry had left Whittle and Power Jets out of these negotiations. Rover chief engineer Maurice Wilks led the team to develop the engine, improving the performance over the original Whittle design. The first test engines to the W.2B design were built in Bankfield Shed, a former cotton mill in Barnoldswick, Lancashire which Rover moved into in June 1941 (along with Waterloo Mill in Clitheroe). Testing commenced towards the end of October 1941.

A need for greater expertise within the project, along with difficult relations between Rover management and Frank Whittle (not least because Rover under AM approval had secretly designed a different engine layout, known within Rover as the B.26, which they thought was superior), led to Rover handing over their part in the jet engine project and the Barnoldswick factory to Rolls-Royce in exchange for the latter&#x27;s Meteor tank engine factory at Ascot Road, Nottingham, the result of a handshake deal between Rover&#x27;s Spencer Wilks and Rolls-Royce&#x27;s Ernest Hives made in a local inn in Clitheroe. The official hand-over date was 1 April 1943, though there was a considerable overlap, and several key Rover staff such as Adrian Lombard and John Herriot, the latter being at Rover on secondment from the Air Inspection Department (AID) of the AM, moved to Rolls-Royce. In exchange for the jet engine project and its facilities, Rover was given the contract and production equipment to make Meteor tank engines, which continued until 1964. The Meteor engine was superseded for new tanks in 1962, and as Rover wanted more manufacturing capacity for the Land Rover they transferred the manufacture of Meteor spare parts for the British and other governments back to Rolls-Royce at Shrewsbury. Although Rolls-Royce under Stanley Hooker were soon to be able to start producing the Whittle-designed W.2B/23 engine (known within Rover as the B.23, later named by Rolls-Royce the Welland), they evaluated the 4 Lombard/Herriot re-designed Rover W.2B/B.26 engines under test at the time of the takeover, and selected the Rover design for their own jet engine development (it became the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine).

After the Second World War, the company abandoned Helen Street and bought the two shadow factories. Acocks Green carried on for a while, making Meteor engines for tanks such as the Centurion and Conqueror, and Solihull became the new centre for vehicles, with production resuming in 1947. This was the year Rover produced the Rover 12 Sports Tourer. 200 cars were built for the export market but all had RHD so many cars stayed in the UK. Solihull would become the home of the Land Rover.

===Experimental cars===
Despite the difficulties experienced with the jet engine project, Rover was interested in the development of the gas turbine engine to power vehicles. In 1945, Rover hired engineers Frank Bell and Spen King away from Rolls-Royce to assist Maurice Wilks in the development of automotive gas turbines. By 1949, the team developed a turbine that ran at 55,000 rpm, produced more than , and could run on petrol, paraffin, or diesel oil. Rover&#x27;s early turbine engines consumed fuel at a rate much greater than piston engines, equivalent to . Although fuel consumption was later reduced by using a heat exchanger, it was never as low as that of contemporary piston engines.

In March 1950, Rover showed the JET1 prototype, the first car powered with a gas turbine engine, to the public. JET1, an open two-seat tourer, had the engine positioned behind the seats, air intake grilles on either side of the car, and exhaust outlets on the top of the tail. During tests, the car reached a top speed of . After being shown in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1950, JET1 was further developed, and was subjected to speed trials on the Jabbeke highway in Belgium in June 1952, where it exceeded . JET1 is currently on display at the London Science Museum.

Four further prototypes were built, the P4-based front-engined T2 and rear-engined T2A saloons, the rear-engined four-wheel-drive T3 coupé, and the front-engined front-wheel drive T4 saloon.

Rover and the BRM Formula One team joined forces to produce the Rover-BRM, a gas turbine-powered sports prototype that entered the 1963 24 hours of Le Mans, driven by Graham Hill and Richie Ginther. It averaged 107.8 mph (173 km/h) and had a top speed of 142 mph (229 km/h).

Rover also ran several experimental diesel engine projects in relation to the Land Rover. The 2-litre, diesel unit designed and built by Rover for its 4x4 had entered production in 1956 and was one of Britain&#x27;s first modern high-speed automotive diesel engines. Experimental projects were undertaken to improve the engine&#x27;s power delivery, running qualities, and fuel tolerances. British Army requirements led to the development of a multifuel version of the 2.25-litre variant of the engine in 1962, which could run on petrol, diesel, Jet-A, or kerosene. However, the engine&#x27;s power output when running on low-grade fuel was too low for the Army&#x27;s uses. Rover developed a highly advanced (for the time) turbodiesel version of its engine in the mid-1960s to power its experimental &#x27;129-inch&#x27; heavy duty Land Rover designs. This 2.5-litre engine used a turbocharger built by Rover&#x27;s gas turbine division as well as an intercooler. This was one of the first times these features had been incorporated on such a small-capacity diesel unit, but they were not adopted.

After the Leyland Motor Corporation takeover, the Rover Gas Turbine was used in a number of Leyland trucks, including one shown at the 1968 Commercial Motor Show. Rover gas turbines also powered the first Advanced Passenger Train.

===Golden years===
The 1950s and &#x27;60s were fruitful years for the company. The Land Rover became a runaway success (despite Rover&#x27;s reputation for making upmarket saloons, the utilitarian Land Rover was actually the company&#x27;s biggest seller throughout the 1950s, &#x27;60s, and &#x27;70s), as well as the P5 and P6 saloons equipped with a 3.5L (215ci) aluminium V8 (the design and tooling of which was purchased from Buick) and pioneering research into gas turbine-powered vehicles.

As the &#x27;60s drew to a close Rover was working on a number of innovative projects. Having purchased the Alvis company in 1965 Rover was working on a V8-powered supercar to sell under the Alvis name. The prototype, called the P6BS, was completed and the finalised styling and engineering proposal, the P9, was drawn up. Rover was also working on the P8 project which aimed to replace the existing P5 large saloon with a modern design similar in concept to a scaled-up P6.

When Leyland Motors joined with British Motor Holdings and Rover and Jaguar became corporate partners these projects were cancelled to prevent internal competition with Jaguar products. The P8 in particular was cancelled in a very late stage of preparation- Rover had already ordered the dies and stamping equipment for making the car&#x27;s body panels at Pressed Steel when ordered to stop work.

Rover continued to develop its &#x27;100-inch Station Wagon&#x27;, which became the ground-breaking Range Rover, launched in 1970. This also used the ex-Buick V8 engine as well as the P6&#x27;s innovative safety-frame body structure design and features such as permanent four-wheel drive and all-round disc brakes. The Range Rover was initially designed as a utility vehicle which could offer the off-road capability of the Land Rover, but in a more refined and car-like package.
===Mergers to LMC and BL===

In 1967, Rover became part of the Leyland Motor Corporation (LMC), which already owned Triumph. The next year, LMC merged with British Motor Holdings (BMH) to become the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). Rover was grouped together with Triumph and Jaguar in the Specialist Division, which was the performance-luxury division of BLMC. This was the beginning of the end for the independent Rover Company, as the Solihull-based company&#x27;s heritage drowned beneath the infamous industrial relations and managerial problems that beset the British motor industry throughout the 1970s. 

Whilst Jaguar retained much of its independence within the Specialist Division, the former Rover and Triumph organisations worked on a series of shared projects throughout the 1970s - but the only Rover product to be launched was the Rover SD1 (Specialist Division No.1) in 1976, and was the final car that can be thought of as coming from the original Rover Company lineage, being designed by ex-Rover engineers and was initially produced at Solihull. In 1978, British Leyland created a new subsidiary known as &quot;Land Rover Limited&quot; which encompassed much of the original assets of the Rover Company and the production of the Series Land Rover and Range Rover, which by now had become one of the beleaguered conglomerate&#x27;s most profitable product lines. Production of the Rover SD1 moved to the former BMC/Morris plant in Cowley in 1982, signalling the end for Rover-badged car production at the historic Lode Lane site.

<text>The Postal Service was an American indie pop group from Seattle, Washington, consisting of singer Ben Gibbard, producer Jimmy Tamborello, and Jenny Lewis on background vocals.

The band released their sole studio album, &quot;Give Up&quot;, in 2003 on Sub Pop Records, to mostly positive reviews. The album reached number 114 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The group decided to disband two years later, viewing attempts at a follow-up as unnecessary.

The band has regrouped twice for the anniversaries of &quot;Give Up&quot;, in both 2013 and 2023; each time they were accompanied by a rotating cast of support musicians, including Laura Burhenn, Jen Wood, Dave Depper and Jason McGerr.

The band announced that their last performance would be on September 21, 2024 at HFStival in Washington D.C.

==History==
===Formation (2001–2003)===
The group formed after Ben Gibbard contributed vocals for a song by Jimmy Tamborello called &quot;(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan&quot;, from the Dntel album &quot;Life Is Full of Possibilities&quot;. The song sparked an EP of remixes of other artists, such as Lali Puna, The Flaming Lips, Safety Scissors, Barbara Morgenstern and Superpitcher, and was so well-received that the two artists decided to further collaborate. The third member of the band, Jenny Lewis, recorded vocals for several tracks before eventually becoming a full-fledged member of the band, sharing vocals and instrumentation in their live shows.

The band&#x27;s name was chosen due to how it produced its songs. Due to conflicting schedules, Tamborello wrote and performed instrumental tracks and then sent the DATs through the mail to Gibbard, who then edited the song as he saw fit (adding his vocals along the way) and sent them back to Tamborello. Ironically, despite the final name they chose for the project, they did not use the United States Postal Service as a courier; the CDs were sent through either FedEx or UPS.

===&quot;Give Up&quot; (2003–2007)===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Give Up&quot;, was released on February 18, 2003, on Sub Pop Records. Several songs on the album feature guest vocals from Lewis, as well as vocals from indie rock musician Jen Wood. Additionally, Gibbard&#x27;s Death Cab for Cutie bandmate Chris Walla played the guitar and piano on several tracks. Although both Gibbard and Tamborello&#x27;s main projects were still active at the time, The Postal Service supported the album with a successful concert tour and stated its intention to tour again in the future.

&quot;Give Up&quot; received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America in March 2005, and later receiving platinum certification in October 2012. The album was Sub Pop&#x27;s most successful release after Nirvana&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;.

The album produced three singles, the most well-known single being &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;, which was released as &quot;Give Up&quot;&#x27;s lead single. The song featured in advertisements for UPS, Kaiser Permanente, and M&amp;M&#x27;s, as well as being the first theme song for ABC&#x27;s Grey&#x27;s Anatomy in 2005. A cover of the song by Iron &amp; Wine was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film &quot;Garden State&quot;. It was also later covered by Amanda Palmer, Ben Folds, The Scene Aesthetic, Brack Cantrell, Streetlight Manifesto, Confide, Gareth Pearson, Joy Kills Sorrow and Postmodern Jukebox. Confide would later release a music video for their cover of &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;. The second single, &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;, was featured in the soundtrack of the 2004 film D.E.B.S. and later covered by British singer-songwriter Frank Turner. The third and final single, &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes&quot;, was covered by The Shins, and the original version was featured in the trailer for the movie &quot;Funny People&quot;.

====United States Postal Service controversy====
In August 2003, the United States Postal Service sent the band a cease and desist letter, citing the band&#x27;s name as an infringement of its trademark on the phrase &quot;postal service&quot;. After negotiations, the USPS relented, allowing the band use of the trademark in exchange for promotional efforts on behalf of the USPS and a performance at its annual National Executive Conference. Additionally, at one point the USPS website sold the band&#x27;s CDs. In 2007, &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; appeared in the background of the &quot;whiteboard&quot; advertising campaign for one of the federal establishment&#x27;s private competitors, the United Parcel Service.

===Possible second album (2007–2012)===
On June 22, 2007, it was revealed that The Postal Service had begun work on a new album, though the specifics of the production and the release date were vague. Gibbard stated, &quot;We&#x27;re slowly starting. We&#x27;re crawling right now, and whether that crawl turns into a walk remains to be seen. But we&#x27;ll know more towards the end of the year. I&#x27;ve just been touring so much and trying to find time to make it happen and make our schedules line up.&quot; Tamborello added, &quot;We&#x27;re talking about wanting to finish an album by sometime next year, because we have to work with Death Cab&#x27;s schedule and stuff. I definitely want to do another one.&quot;

On February 29, 2008, Spinner released an article stating that The Postal Service might not release a new album. Ben Gibbard stated, &quot;Jimmy and I are still throwing ideas back and forth, but as time goes on, we find ourselves busy with our own music. ... We have some stuff, but it&#x27;s been difficult to find the time and the drive to do the record. I&#x27;d love to finish it at some point and maybe even do some performances. If it&#x27;s meant to be, it&#x27;s meant to be.&quot; In May 2008, Gibbard stated that he and Tamborello were unlikely to release another album &quot;before the end of the decade.&quot;

In a December 2008 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Gibbard laughed off suggestions that The Postal Service&#x27;s long overdue follow-up to their 2003 hit &quot;Give Up&quot; would be an indie version of the Guns N&#x27; Roses album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, which took 15 years to produce and release. Gibbard said that both he and Tamborello do not see it as a priority in light of their main projects, Death Cab for Cutie and Dntel, respectively. He said, &quot;The anticipation of the second record has been a far bigger deal for everybody except the two of us... I don&#x27;t know about it being the indie-rock &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, but now that &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; has come out, I guess it just becomes the second Postal Service record that will never come out. There never really was a plan to do a second album. We work from time to time together but we have other things that take up all of our time.&quot;

In November 2012, Ben Gibbard posted on his Twitter account that there are &quot;no plans&quot; to produce another Postal Service record, and did not cite any specific reason for this statement, other than the fact that multiple fans questioned if there was going to be a second album.

===Reunion, &quot;Give Up&quot; re-issue, and disbandment (2013–2014)===

In January 2013, The Postal Service updated its website to read &quot;The Postal Service 2013&quot;, reigniting speculation that the band would play shows, or possibly release a new album. It was later confirmed that the image on the band&#x27;s site portended that the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Give Up&quot;, would receive a 10th-anniversary re-issue featuring a 15-song disc of rarities, including two new songs with Jenny Lewis to be released on April 9, 2013. The following month, The Postal Service announced it would officially reunite for an extended world tour with venues including Red Rocks Amphitheatre, the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, Sasquatch! Music Festival in Washington in May, the Primavera Sound Festival 2013 in Barcelona, and Free Press Summer Fest in Houston, Texas in June.

Along with the reunion, the band released their first new track in ten years called &quot;A Tattered Line of String&quot; featuring Jenny Lewis. On March 21, the band released a second new track titled &quot;Turn Around&quot;, released through 107.7 The End.

As a tie-in to the &quot;Give Up&quot; reissue, comedy website Funny or Die posted a parody video directed by Tom Scharpling set in 2002 titled &quot;The Postal Service Auditions&quot;, in which Jimmy Tamborello holds auditions for his musical collaborator. Guest stars on the video include &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Moby, Duff McKagan, Tom DeLonge, Aimee Mann, Jon Wurster, Page Hamilton, Nate Mendel, and Marc Maron.

On August 3, 2013, Ben Gibbard announced on Twitter that the Lollapalooza after-show would be the last Postal Service performance ever, and that the band would formally disband permanently after the show, finally quashing rumors of a highly anticipated second album. The band played their last live show at the Metro Chicago on August 5, 2013.

===Subsequent collaborations, releases and &quot;Everything Will Change&quot; (2014–2022)===

As an end punctuation mark to their career, The Postal Service released the feature-length documentary concert film &quot;Everything Will Change&quot; on October 7, 2014, filmed during their two performances at the Greek Theater in Berkeley, CA, July 26–27, 2013. Directed by Justin Mitchell, the film intersperses backstage tapes and interviews with complete footage of the concert itself.

Jimmy Tamborello produced a remix of Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s 2018 song &quot;Summer Years&quot;.

Jenny Lewis toured with Death Cab for Cutie in the summer of 2019, in support of their &quot;On the Line&quot; and &quot;Thank You for Today&quot; albums, respectively. On select dates, Gibbard invited Lewis to join DCFC for their set&#x27;s encore, and DCFC played &quot;Nothing Better&quot;, with Gibbard and Lewis doing the vocals from the original song.

On October 6, 2020, The Postal Service created new social media accounts for the band and teased an announcement for the following day, sparking speculation about new music. The announcement was a mock video conference featuring Gibbard, Tamborello, and Lewis along with several musicians and celebrities urging people in the United States to vote in the November election, done in the style of 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Postal Service Auditions&quot;.

On December 4, 2020, The Postal Service released the live album &quot;Everything Will Change&quot; via Sub Pop Records, featuring the complete live recordings from the documentary/concert film released in 2014, remastered and available in audio format for the first time. Live tracks &quot;Natural Anthem&quot; and &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; from the album were released as digital singles on November 22, 2020.

===&quot;Give Up&quot; 20th Anniversary Tour (2023–2024)===

In late summer 2023, The Postal Service reunited again for a co-headlining anniversary tour with Death Cab for Cutie. The Postal Service performed &quot;Give Up&quot; in its entirety, while Death Cab for Cutie performed &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; in its entirety, in celebration of the 20th anniversaries of both albums. The tour originally consisted of 17 shows. However, due to high demand many more additional shows were added, with the tour lasting into September 2024. &quot;Give Up&quot; was played in full at each show, followed by an encore of &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; on acoustic guitar and a cover of &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; by Depeche Mode.

In August 2024, ahead of the band&#x27;s UK and European leg of the tour, Gibbard reflected on whether there could be a second The Postal Service album, noting: &quot;I think the main reason that a second Postal Service record has never come to fruition – and will never come to fruition – the time commitments that Death Cab ended up taking, which really started with &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, haven’t really ever let up. There’s just not enough time, let alone creative juices flowing, to make a suitable follow-up [to &quot;Give Up&quot;]. I think anything that we would attempt to make at this point would be thoroughly disappointing. The stakes are just lower [in Death Cab] when you’re putting an album out every two to three years. If people don’t like this one, there’ll be another one later. But after 20 years, there is no way we could ever follow that up in a way that would be satisfying to people. I would rather have all my focus on Death Cab than be watering both projects down. I just don’t have the capacity to do both. Some might argue I barely have the capacity to do one!&quot;

On 7 February 2025, The Postal Service released a live recording of their cover of &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; from the 2023-2024 reunion tour, on the benefit charity compilation Good Music to Lift Los Angeles. The compilation was available for 24 hours only, and benefited various Los Angeles area charities in the wake of the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

<doc id="286099" wikidata="Q2979393" url="?curid=286099" title="Lower Canada Tories">
<text>Lower Canada Tories is a general name for individuals and parliamentary groups in Lower Canada, and later in the Province of Canada&#x27;s division of Canada East, who supported the British connection, colonialism, and a strong colonial governor. They generally favoured assimilation of French-Canadians to British culture, laws, and the English language, and opposed democracy.

== Château Clique ==
The Château Clique, or &quot;&quot;, was a group of wealthy families in Lower Canada in the early 19th century. They were the Lower Canada equivalent of the Family Compact in Upper Canada. 

Like the Family Compact, the Château Clique gained most of its influence after the War of 1812. Most of its families were British merchants, but some were French Canadian seigneurs who felt that their own interests were best served by an affiliation with this group. Some of the most prominent members were brewer John Molson and James McGill, the founder of McGill University. Generally, they wanted the French Canadian majority of Lower Canada to assimilate to English culture. That included the abolition of the seigneurial system, replacing French civil law with English common law, and replacing the established Roman Catholic Church with the Anglican Church. Their efforts led to the Act of Union (1840), which ultimately failed in its attempt to assimilate all French Canadians but succeeded in preventing their political and economic interests from prevailing over those of Britain. The &quot;Château Clique&quot; also had control over the Crown lands and the clergy reserves but much less than the Family Compact because of the already-existing seigneurial system.

== Parliamentary groups ==
They were also known on the electoral scene as the &quot;Parti bureaucrate&quot; (Bureaucratic Party), also known as the British Party or the Tory Party.

==Constitutional framework==
The Constitutional Act of 1791 had established three branches of government: the Legislative Assembly, an elected lower house; the Legislative Council, an appointed upper house; and the Executive Council, which acted as a kind of cabinet for the lieutenant governor. The governor was appointed by the British Crown, and he appointed members of the Clique as his advisers. The Clique was also able to establish itself in the Legislative Council, leaving the Legislative Assembly, made up of a majority of French-Canadian representatives, with little or no power.

==Lower Canada Rebellion==
Louis-Joseph Papineau, as a reformer in the Assembly, was one of the fiercest opponents of the Château Clique. His struggles against the Clique and the Lieutenant Governor, Lord Gosford, led to the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837.

After the rebellion, Upper and Lower Canada were united as the Province of Canada, but the Château Clique did not disappear like the Family Compact. While the English-speaking population became the majority, the British-appointed governors still attempted to force the French Canadian population to assimilate. Canada East, as Lower Canada was called after the union, eventually gained some political independence with the union government of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.

<doc id="286100" wikidata="Q519332" url="?curid=286100" title="Prince Arthur of Connaught">
<text>Prince Arthur of Connaught (Arthur Frederick Patrick Albert; 13 January 1883 – 12 September 1938) was a British military officer and a grandson of Queen Victoria. He served as Governor-General of the Union of South Africa from 20 November 1920 to 21 January 1924.

==Early life==

Prince Arthur was born on 13 January 1883 at Windsor Castle. His father was Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His mother was the former Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia.

Arthur was baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on 16 February 1883, and his godparents were Queen Victoria (his paternal grandmother), the German Empress (his maternal great-grandaunt, for whom his paternal aunt Princess Beatrice stood proxy), Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia (his maternal uncle, who was represented by the German Ambassador Count Münster), Princess Henry of the Netherlands (his maternal aunt, who was represented by Countess Münster), the Duke of Cambridge (his first cousin twice removed), and the Duke of Edinburgh (his paternal uncle, whose brother the Prince of Wales represented him).

Arthur was the first British royal prince to be educated at Eton College. He was known to his family as &quot;young Arthur&quot; to distinguish him from his father.

==Military career==
Prince Arthur was educated at Eton College, but left there early to enter the Royal Military College, Sandhurst at the age of sixteen years and two months. From there he was commissioned into the 7th (Queen&#x27;s Own) Hussars as a second lieutenant in May 1901. He saw his first active posting the following year. After the end of the Second Boer War in June 1902, most of the British troops left South Africa, but the 7th Hussars were posted there to keep the peace. Prince Arthur and 230 men of his regiment left Southampton in the SS &quot;Ortona&quot; in October 1902, and arrived at Cape Town later the same month. He spent several months stationed at Krugersdorp. In 1905, he became an aide-de-camp to his uncle, King Edward VII. In 1907, he was promoted to the rank of captain in the 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys). He became the honorary Colonel-in-Chief of this regiment in 1920.

During the First World War, Prince Arthur served as aide-de-camp to Generals Sir John French and Sir Douglas Haig, the successive commanders of the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1919. In October 1920, Prince Arthur was promoted to the honorary rank of major general. He became a colonel in the reserves in 1922.

Since the king&#x27;s children were too young to undertake public duties until after the First World War, Prince Arthur carried out a variety of ceremonial duties at home and overseas. This included opening the Scottish National Exhibition, which was held in Saughton Park, Edinburgh. One of the attractions was the Senegal Village with its French-speaking Senegalese residents, on show demonstrating their way of life, art and craft while living in beehive huts.

==Marriage==

On 15 October 1913, Prince Arthur married his first cousin once removed Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife (17 May 1891 – 26 February 1959) at the Chapel Royal, St. James&#x27;s Palace, London. She was the eldest daughter and heiress of Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, by his wife Louise, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of King Edward VII. They had one son Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn.

==Later life==
After the accession of his cousin, King George V, Prince Arthur and his father were the most senior male members of the royal family over the age of 18 to reside in the United Kingdom. As such, he undertook a wide variety of royal duties on behalf of the King, and acted as a Counsellor of State during periods of the King&#x27;s absence abroad.

In 1906, by order of the King, Arthur&#x27;s father vested the Meiji emperor of Japan with the Order of the Garter, as a consequence of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Following his mother&#x27;s death in 1917, he inherited approximately £48,000 from her £123,000 estate. In 1918, Arthur was a guest aboard the Japanese battlecruiser when she voyaged from Japan to Canada. He visited Tokyo and then Nagoya and was welcomed at Tsuruma Park and the Buntenkaku, and then traveled on to Kyoto. In 1920, Prince Arthur succeeded Viscount Buxton as governor-general and commander-in-chief in South Africa. The Earl of Athlone succeeded him in these posts in 1924. Upon returning to Britain, Prince Arthur became involved in a number of charitable organizations, including serving as chairman of the board of directors of Middlesex Hospital. Like his father, the Duke of Connaught, he was active in the Freemasons, becoming Provincial Grand Master for Berkshire in 1924.

In May 1935, he was appointed High Steward (civic) of Reading, Berkshire, a post which had been vacant since 1910. One of his last public appearances was at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937.

Prince Arthur of Connaught died of stomach cancer at age 55 on 12 September 1938 at his London home – 41 Belgrave Square, Belgravia, London. His coffin was subsequently taken to the Middlesex Hospital, where Prince Arthur had been the chairman, and his body lay-in-state in the private chapel, with nurses from the hospital keeping vigil. Following his funeral at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, on 16 September 1938; his remains were interred in the Royal Vault, beneath St George&#x27;s Chapel on 22 September 1938. He was later reburied privately in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. His will was sealed in London in 1939. His estate was valued at £109,418 (or £4.9 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation). His father, the Duke of Connaught, survived him by four years. Prince Arthur&#x27;s son, who used the courtesy title Earl of MacDuff after 1917, succeeded his paternal grandfather as 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and Earl of Sussex in 1942, but died the following year.

<text>The Metaphysical Society was a famous British debating society, founded in 1869 by James Knowles, who acted as Secretary. Membership was by invitation only, and was exclusively male. Many of its members were prominent clergymen, philosophers, and politicians.

==Overview==
The society met monthly, from November to July (to mirror the sitting of Parliament). Its members were never all present at once, and most meetings never exceeded twenty attendees. Papers were read and discussed at meetings on such subjects as the ultimate grounds of belief in the objective and moral sciences, the immortality of the soul, etc. A description of one of the meetings was given by William Connor Magee (then Bishop of Peterborough) in a letter on 13 February 1873:
Archbishop Manning in the chair was flanked by two Protestant bishops right and left; on my right was Hutton, editor of the &quot;Spectator&quot;, an Arian; then came Father Dalgairns, a very able Roman Catholic priest; opposite him Lord A. Russell, a Deist; then two Scotch metaphysical writers, Freethinkers; then Knowles, the very broad editor of the Contemporary; then, dressed as a layman and looking like a country squire, was Ward, formerly Rev. Ward, and earliest of the perverts to Rome; then Greg, author of &quot;The Creed of Christendom&quot;, a Deist; then Froude, the historian, once a deacon in our Church, now a Deist; then Roden Noël, an actual Atheist and red republican, and looking very like one! Lastly Ruskin, who read a paper on miracles, which we discussed for an hour and a half! Nothing could be calmer, fairer, or even, on the whole, more reverent than the discussion. In my opinion, we, the Christians, had much the best of it. Dalgairns, the priest, was very masterly; Manning, clever and precise and weighty; Froude, very acute, and so was Greg. We only wanted a Jew and a Muslim to make our Religious Museum complete (&quot;Life&quot;, i. 284).
The last meeting of the society was held on 16 May 1880 and it was dissolved later in November of that year. Huxley said that it died &quot;of too much love&quot;; Tennyson, &quot;because after ten years of strenuous effort no one had succeeded in even defining metaphysics.&quot; According to Dean Stanley, &quot;We all meant the same thing if we only knew it.&quot;

In 1877 Knowles founded &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot;, a literary journal whose editorial style was partly inspired by the debates he had managed at the Metaphysical Society. Many of the society&#x27;s members became supporters and contributors to the magazine.

<doc id="286104" wikidata="Q2083283" url="?curid=286104" title="Colorado Springs Sky Sox">
<text>The Colorado Springs Sky Sox were a Minor League Baseball team in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The team played in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and was the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers (2015–2018), Colorado Rockies (1993–2014), and Cleveland Indians (1988–1992). The Sky Sox won the PCL title in 1992 and 1995.

==History==
From 1950 to 1958, the original incarnation of the Colorado Springs Sky Sox were a Class A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in the Western League. The Sky Sox&#x27;s nickname originated with their affiliation with the White Sox. The Pikes Peak region was without professional baseball for 30 years until 1988, when the Hawaii Islanders of the PCL relocated to Colorado Springs and became the second incarnation of the Sky Sox. From 1988 to 1992 the Sky Sox were the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. When Denver was awarded a major league franchise for the 1993 season, the new Colorado Rockies arranged for the Sky Sox to become their top farm team.

During their first season, the Sky Sox moved from Spurgeon Stadium (in Memorial Park) to the brand new Sky Sox Stadium, later known as Security Service Field. The ballpark, on the eastern edge of Colorado Springs, cost US$3.4 million to build and held 8,500 spectators. In later years, the Sky Sox invested over $8 million in ballpark renovations which included a new video scoreboard, redesigned entrance plaza, new picnic facility and banquet hall. It has the highest elevation of any professional ballpark in the United States: its natural grass field sits at above sea level.

On June 21, 2017, team owner David G. Elmore announced the relocation of the Sky Sox Triple-A franchise to San Antonio, Texas, in 2019, with the team continuing to compete in the Pacific Coast League as the San Antonio Missions, who were previously members of the Double-A Texas League. Concurrent with this move, the Rookie Helena Brewers of the Pioneer League relocated to Colorado Springs, operating as the Rocky Mountain Vibes.

<doc id="286105" wikidata="Q891366" url="?curid=286105" title="Bolivarian Circles">
<text>The Bolivarian Circles () are political and social organizations of workers&#x27; councils in Venezuela, originally created by President Hugo Chávez on 21 December 2001. The circles have also been described as militias and compared to Cuba&#x27;s Committees for the Defense of the Revolution and Panama&#x27;s Dignity Battalions.

Following the involvement of Bolivarian Circles in defending President Chávez during the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt, the government sponsored the creation of official communal councils on 10 April 2006, some of which became armed colectivos instead.

== Background ==
In April 2001, President Hugo Chávez tasked then-Vice President Diosdado Cabello and Miguel Rodríguez Torres to create and finance community organizations that would share local interests to Chávez so his government could lend resources and gain political support. Such support from the government made Chávez&#x27;s opponents skeptical of any claims of autonomy. They are named in honor of Simón Bolívar, the leader who transformed most of South America from Spanish colonial outposts to the independent states now in place.

The circles were created as state-sanctioned groups that were to be the &quot;principle organizing unit of popular power&quot; and were announced by Chávez as &quot;a great human network&quot; that was created to defend the Bolivarian Revolution. Some circles were modeled after the Dignity Battalions that were created by Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega in Panama since Chávez admired the model when stationed there during his military career. The founding documents of Venezuela&#x27;s Bolivarian Circles state that &quot;the Supreme leader of Bolivarian Circles will be the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela&quot; and that &quot;the national and international headquarters for the registration of Bolivarian Circles will be the Palace of Miraflores&quot;.

Some Bolivarian Circles were given combat training and weapons, with some of their leaders being trained in Cuba. According to Lina Ron, a Chávez supporter and head of her own Bolivarian Circle, La Piedrita, thousands of circles deeply loyal to Chávez were &quot;armed to the teeth&quot;. Chávez denied allegations of funding and the circles use of weapons.

== History ==
In January 2002, Bolivarian Circles were reported to have blocked the entrance of the newspaper office &quot;El Nacional&quot; for over an hour. Numerous journalists have been threatened, berated, and abused physically and verbally, particularly by people that identified with the Bolivarian Circles.

Bolivarian Circles also took part in demonstrations that became violent against the 2002 coup attempt. Shortly after the coup attempt in a May 2002 cable from the US Embassy in Caracas, there were concerned reports of members of Bolivarian Circles receiving new motorcycles, Nike brand clothing and that members of the Bolivarian Circles became armed, causing panic in neighborhoods. Numbers of Bolivarian Circles also increased significantly that month according to Diosdado Cabello, with number rising from 80,000 to 130,000.

=== 2007 protests ===
On 7 November 2007, masked gunmen riding motorcycles opened fire on students returning from a march in Caracas. At the Central University of Venezuela, eight people were injured, including one by gunfire.

=== Colectivos ===
According to private intelligence agency company Stratfor, Bolivarian Circles were also the parent organization of colectivos in Venezuela.

<text>In speculative fiction, a force field, sometimes known as an energy shield, force shield, energy bubble, or deflector shield, is a barrier produced by something like energy, negative energy, dark energy, electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, electric fields, quantum fields, telekinetic fields, plasma, particles, radiation, solid light, magic, or pure force. It protects a person, area, or object from attacks or intrusions, or even deflects energy attacks back at the attacker. This fictional technology is created as a field of energy without matter that acts as a wall, so that objects affected by the particular force relating to the field are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side, instead being deflected or destroyed. Actual research in the 21st century has looked into the potential to deflect radiation or cosmic rays, as well as more extensive shielding.
This concept has become a staple of many science-fiction works, so much so that authors frequently do not even bother to explain or justify them to their readers, treating them almost as established fact and attributing whatever capabilities the plot requires. The ability to create force fields has become a frequent superpower in superhero media.

==History==
The concept of a force field goes back at least as far as early 20th century. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; suggests that the first use of the term in science fiction was in 1931, in &quot;Spacehounds of IPC&quot; by E.E. &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith.
An early precursor of what is now called &quot;force field&quot; may be found in William Hope Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;The Night Land&quot; (1912), where the Last Redoubt, the fortress of the remnants of a far-future humanity, is kept safe by &quot;The Air Clog&quot; generated by the burning &quot;Earth-Current&quot;. An even earlier precursor is Florence Carpenter Dieudonné&#x27;s 1887 novel &quot;Rondah, or Thirty-Three Years in a Star&quot;, where the far-off Sun Island is enclosed by a &quot;wall in the air&quot; that blocks access by land, sea and air, which is occasionally disabled.

In Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; universe, personal shields have been developed by scientists specializing in the miniaturization of planet-based shields. As they are primarily used by Foundation Traders, most other inhabitants of the Galactic Empire do not know about this technology. In an unrelated short story &quot;Breeds There a Man...?&quot; by Asimov, scientists are working on a force field (&quot;energy so channelled as to create a wall of matter-less inertia&quot;), capable of protecting the population in case of a nuclear war. The force field demonstrated in the end is a solid hemisphere, apparently completely opaque and reflective from both sides. Asimov explores the force field concept again in the short story Not Final!.

The concept of force fields as a defensive measure from enemy attack or as a form of attack can be regularly found in modern video games as well as in film, such as in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953, George Pál) and &quot;Independence Day&quot;.

The ability to create a force field has been a common superpower in comic books and associated media. While only a few characters have the explicit ability to create force fields (for example, the Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four and Violet Parr from &quot;The Incredibles&quot;), it has been emulated via other powers, such as Green Lantern&#x27;s energy constructs, Jean Grey&#x27;s telekinesis, and Magneto&#x27;s manipulation of electromagnetic fields. Apart from this, its importance is also highlighted in Dr. Michio Kaku&#x27;s books (such as &quot;Physics of the Impossible&quot;).

==Fiction==
Science fiction and fantasy avenues suggest a number of potential uses of force fields:

* A barrier allowing workers to function in areas exposed to the vacuum of space. The atmosphere inside would be habitable by humans, while at the same time allowing permissible objects to pass through the barrier
* A walkable surface between two points without the necessity of building a bridge.
* An emergency quarantine area to service those afflicted by harmful biological or chemical agents
* A fire extinguisher where oxygen is exhausted by the use of a space confined by a force field thereby starving the fire
* As a shield to protect against damage from natural forces or an enemy attack 
* As a deflector to allow fast spaceships to traverse space without colliding with small particles or objects.
* A temporary habitable space in an area otherwise unsuitable for sustaining life
* As a security apparatus used to confine or contain a captive

The capabilities and functionality of force fields vary; in some works of fiction (such as in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe), energy shields can nullify or mitigate the effects of both energy and particle (e.g., phasers) and conventional weapons, as well as supernatural forces. In many fictional scenarios, the shields function primarily as a defensive measure against weapons fired from other spacecraft. Force fields in these stories also generally prevent transporting. There are generally two kinds of force fields postulated: one in which energy is projected as a flat plane from emitters around the edges of a spacecraft and another where energy surrounds a ship like a bubble.

The ability to create force fields has become a frequent superpower in superhero media. While sometimes an explicit power on their own, force fields have also been attributed to other fictional abilities. Marvel Comics&#x27; Jean Grey is able to use her telekinesis to create a barrier of telekinetic energy that acts as a force field by repelling objects. Similarly, Magneto is able to use his magnetism to manipulate magnetic fields into acting as shields.
The most common superpower link seen with force fields is the power of invisibility. This is seen with Marvel Comics&#x27; Invisible Woman and Disney Pixar&#x27;s Violet Parr.

Force fields often vary in what they are made of, though are commonly made of energy. The 2017 series &quot;The Gifted&quot; featured character Lauren Strucker who had the ability to create shields by pushing molecules together. This resulted in her being able to construct force fields out of air and water particles rather than energy.

==Research==
In 2005, the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts devised a way to protect from radiation by applying an electric field to spheres made of a thin, non-conductive material coated with a layer of gold with either positive or negative charges, which could be arranged to bend a stream of charged particles to protect from radiation.

In 2006, a University of Washington group in Seattle, Washington, had been experimenting with using a bubble of charged plasma, contained by a fine mesh of superconducting wire, to surround a spacecraft. This would protect the spacecraft from interstellar radiation and some particles without needing physical shielding.

The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was in 2007 attempting to design an actual test satellite, which would orbit Earth with a charged plasma field around it.

In 2008, &quot;Cosmos Magazine&quot; reported on research into creating an artificial replica of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field around a spacecraft to protect astronauts from dangerous cosmic rays. British and Portuguese scientists used a mathematical simulation to prove that it would be possible to create a &quot;mini-magnetosphere&quot; bubble several hundred meters across, possibly generated by a small uncrewed vessel that could accompany a future crewed mission to Mars.

In 2014, a group of students from the University of Leicester released a study describing functioning of spaceship plasma deflector shields.

In 2015, Boeing was granted a patent on a force field system designed to protect against shock waves generated by explosions. It is not intended to protect against projectiles, radiation, or energy weapons such as lasers. The field purportedly works by using a combination of lasers, electricity and microwaves to rapidly heat the air creating a field of (ionised) superheated air-plasma which disrupts, or at least attenuates, the shock wave. As of March 2016, no working models were known to have been demonstrated.

In 2016, Rice University scientists discovered that Tesla coils can generate force fields able to manipulate matter (process called teslaphoresis).

<doc id="286109" wikidata="Q1317174" url="?curid=286109" title="John Garand">
<text>Jean Cantius Garand ( , ; January 1, 1888 – February 16, 1974), also known as John C. Garand, was a Canadian-American designer of firearms who created the M1 Garand, a semi-automatic rifle that was widely used by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps during both World War II and the Korean War.

==Early life==
Garand was one of twelve children (six boys and six girls) born on a farm near St. Rémi, Quebec. His father moved to Jewett City, Connecticut, with the children when their mother died in 1899. All of the boys had the first name St. Jean le Baptiste, but only he went by the first name John. The other boys went by their middle names. Several of his brothers were also inventors. The children were employed in a textile mill where John learned to speak English while sweeping floors. John became interested in guns and learned to shoot after working at a shooting gallery. John learned machinist skills while working at the textile mill, and was hired by Browne and Sharpe, a Providence, Rhode Island, toolmaking company in 1909. Later, he found employment with a New York toolmaking firm in 1916, and resumed rifle practice at the shooting galleries along Broadway. Garand became a naturalized United States citizen in 1920.

Pronunciation of the name &quot;Garand&quot; has differed, pronounced as or . Descendants of John Garand and his close friend General Julian Hatcher generally agree with the latter, rhyming approximately with &#x27;errand&#x27;.

==Designer of firearms==
Garand&#x27;s fondness for machinery and target shooting blended naturally into a hobby of designing guns, which took a more vocational turn in 1917. That year the United States Army took bids on designs for a light machine gun, and Garand&#x27;s design was eventually selected by the War Department. Garand was appointed to a position with the United States Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C., with the task of perfecting the weapon. The first model was not built until 1919, too late for use in World War I, but the government employed Garand as an engineer at the Springfield Armory from November 4, 1919 until he retired in 1953.

In Springfield, Massachusetts, Garand was tasked with designing a basic gas-actuated self-loading infantry rifle and carbine that would eject the spent cartridge and reload a new round using a gas-operated system. Designing a rifle that was practical in terms of effectiveness, reliability, and production, stretched over time; it took fifteen years to perfect the M1 prototype model to meet all the U.S. Army specifications. The resulting &quot;Semiautomatic, Caliber .30, M1 Rifle&quot; was patented by Garand in 1932, approved by the U.S. Army on January 9, 1936, and went into mass production in 1940. It replaced the bolt-action M1903 Springfield and became the standard infantry rifle known as the &quot;Garand Rifle&quot;. During World War II, over four million M1 rifles were manufactured. The Garand Rifle proved to be an effective and reliable weapon and was praised by General MacArthur. General Patton wrote, &quot;In my opinion, the M1 rifle is the greatest battle implement ever devised.&quot;

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Garand designed and built a prototype bullpup rifle. It fired the same cartridge as the M1, but the magazine, action and shape were completely different. It was a select-fire design, and had a firing rate of about 600rpm. When Garand retired in 1953, the second version of the T31 was incomplete. The project was scrapped, and the prototype was retired to the Springfield Armory museum in 1961. 
Garand never received any royalties from his M1 rifle design despite over six and a half million M1 rifles being manufactured as he transferred all rights regarding his inventions to the U.S. on January 20, 1936. A bill was introduced in Congress to award him $100,000 in appreciation, but it did not pass. Garand remained in his consulting position with the Springfield Armory until his retirement in 1953.

==Personal life and death==
Garand married French Canadian widow Nellie Bruce Shepard (August 3, 1900 – February 25, 1986) on September 6, 1930, in Albany, New York. She had two daughters by her previous marriage, and they had a daughter and a son of their own.

Garand died in Springfield, Massachusetts, on February 16, 1974, and was buried at Hillcrest Park Cemetery there.

==Recognition==
For his work with the Springfield Armory, Garand was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award in 1941, the Alexander L. Holley Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the first Medal for Merit (together with Albert Hoyt Taylor) on March 28, 1944. In 1973, Garand was inducted into the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps Hall of Fame for designing the M1 Rifle or &quot;The Garand&quot;. The Hall of Fame entry acknowledges both Garand&#x27;s inventive genius and engineering skills:

<text>Sven Aggesen (also known as &quot;Svend Aagesen,&quot; &quot;Aggessøn&quot;, or &quot;Aggesøn&quot;, in Latin &quot;Sveno Aggonis&quot;; born around 1140 to 1150, death unknown) was the author of &quot;Brevis historia regum Dacie&quot;, one of the first attempts to write a coherent history of Denmark covering the period 300AD-1185AD. Only the may precede Aggesen&#x27;s efforts.

==Family==
Sven Aggesen was born into a magnate family which had several well-known members.

The earliest known family member that we know of with some certainty is Sven&#x27;s great-grandfather, Thrugot, who was married to Thorgunna, daughter of Vagn Aggesøn, a grandson of the legendary Palne Toke. Thrugot and Thorgunna had two sons, Sven and Vagn.

Sven Thrugotsøn (or Thorgunnasøn) had four sons. One, probably the eldest, Asser, was the first Archbishop of Lund (1104–1137) and also the first Archbishop of Scandinavia. Another, probably the youngest, Sven, was a canon in Lund, later in Viborg and even later (1132), bishop in Viborg. The third, Eskil, according to Eric Christiansen Eskil, and the last Christiern Svensøn, is Svend Aagesen’s grandfather.

Christiern Svensøn and his son Agge, who was Svend Aggesen’s father, fought during the civil war following Knud Lavard’s murder, on King Erik II Emune&#x27;s side and Svend writes in &quot;Historia brevis regum Dacie,&quot; about their participating in these battles.

==Life and education==

It is likely that Sven was educated at a monastery in Denmark, but given the knowledge of classical antiquity that he portrays through his writings, there is little doubt he received a more comprehensive education elsewhere, probably in one of the big Church-schools in France. Notable in the preface of &quot;Historia brevis regum Dacie,&quot; he mentions that reading the works of Latin historians was something that took up much of his time. On that note he writes, with sadness, that similar works did not exist for Danish kings, notable persons and events.

Like his forefathers, he joined King Valdemar I’s housecarls, known as &quot;Thinglid&quot; – who, it is said, had originated with King Canute the Great&#x27;s corps. As a &quot;Thinglid&quot;, he was with King Valdemar I and later with King Canute VI during their numerous war expeditions, of which he mentions a few personal details in &quot;Historia brevis regum Dacie.&quot;

Because of his comment about Valdemar I’s Queen, Sophia, it seems that he might have been close to the King&#x27;s court. Whether that was because of personal status or because of his forefathers&#x27; status, is unknown.

==Writing==

His service with the King does not seem to have diminished his desire to write.

===&quot;Witherlogh (Lex Castrensis)&quot;===

The first work we know he wrote is a retelling of &quot;Witherlogh&quot; (known today in Danish as &quot;Lejrloven&quot; or &quot;Krigerloven&quot; or in English as &quot;Lejrlaw&quot; or &quot;Warriorlaw&quot;). It is also called &quot;Lex Castrensis&quot;, which is an old punishment and compensation law mostly applied to soldiers in the King&#x27;s service.

This work was probably written in 1181–1182, and we read in the preface of this little work that Aggesen was already considering much bigger projects, because he mentioned his desire to write a list of the Kings of Denmark. It is thought that he did do this work, a necessary work in writing the history of Denmark, because a 13th-century writer used this list, called &quot;Genealogia Regum Daniae&quot;. Today the original list exists only as fragments.

===&quot;Brevis Historia Regum Dacie&quot;===

However his most famous work is &quot;Brevis Historia Regum Dacie&quot;, entitled &quot;Compendiosa regum Daniæ historia&quot; in one manuscript, thought to have been finished in 1186 or 1187 (the last event is described in 1185), a work covering Danish history beginning with the legendary King Skjold from around 300 to 1185.

==Relationship between Svend Aagesen and Saxo Grammaticus==
Whether Svend knew Saxo Grammaticus by more than name, is an often discussed subject. Some comments in &quot;Brevis Historia Regum Daniae&quot; can be interpreted to support this view. Some researchers go as far as to say that they might have gone to school in France together, they both served various Kings of Denmark simultaneously, went on those Kings&#x27; many war expeditions and, as such, some of their writings are firsthand accounts. That is likely to be the case for Sven, but there is very little evidence to back this connection up for Saxo. There exists no direct evidence that they knew each other than by name.

<text>The Johor Strait (also known as the Tebrau Strait, Straits of Johor, Selat Johor, Selat Tebrau, and Tebrau Reach, also spelled Johore Strait) is an international strait in Southeast Asia, between Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia.

==Geography==
The strait separates the Malaysian state of Johor on the mainland Malay Peninsula to the north, from Singapore and its islands on the south. It connects to the Strait of Malacca on the west, and the Singapore Strait on the southeast.

The mouth and delta of the Johor River is on its northeast side in Malaysia.

===Crossings===

There are currently two bridges crossing the strait. The Johor–Singapore Causeway, known simply as &quot;The Causeway&quot;, links Johor Bahru and Woodlands in Singapore. The Malaysia–Singapore Second Link bridge is further west over the strait, links Iskandar Puteri in Malaysia and Tuas in Singapore.

In 2003, Malaysia wanted to build a bridge across the strait to replace the existing causeway, but negotiations with Singapore were not successful. The main reasons cited for the change were:
# a bridge would allow free flow of water across both sides of the strait which were artificially cut in two with the building of the causeway before (this would allow ships to bypass the port of Singapore).
# a bridge would help ease congestion in Johor Bahru.

In August 2003, Malaysia announced that it was going ahead with a plan to build a gently sloping, curved bridge that would join up with Singapore&#x27;s half of the existing causeway. The plans included a swing bridge for the railway line. However, plans to build the bridge have been called off by Malaysia as of 2006 after Singapore said it was amenable to the bridge if the negotiations include other bilateral matters such as the use of Malaysian airspace by Singapore&#x27;s air force and the buying of water and sand resources from Malaysia. Malaysia viewed Singapore&#x27;s proposal as a compromise on its sovereignty.

Other proposed crossings include Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System and Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail. Both of which would have started construction in 2019 but have since been delayed due to the change of political administration in Malaysia in 2018 and the ongoing efforts to reduce national debts incurred previously under Najib Razak&#x27;s administration.

===Tributaries===
Major tributaries which empty into the Strait of Johore include:

* Johor River
* Pelentong River
* Pulai River
* Segget River
* Tebrau River
* Sungai Sengkuang
* Sungai Haji Rahmat
* Sungai Kempas
* Sungai Sri Buntan
* Sungai Abd Samad
* Sungai Air Molek
* Sungai Stulang
* Sungai Setanggong
* Sungai Tampoi
* Sungai Sebulong
* Sungai Bala
* Sungai Pandan
* Sungai Tengkorak
* Sungai Senibong
In the Malay language, &quot;Sungai&quot; is the word for river.

==Ecology==
Pollution along the Johore Strait is notable.

The area is also a source of environmental contention between Malaysia and Singapore, due to land reclamation projects on both sides of the Causeway. There have been suggestions that the ongoing land reclamation projects may impact the maritime boundary, shipping lanes, and water ecology of the Malaysian side. Environmental Impact Assessments are requested before any reclamation is carried out such as the Forest City project.

Reclamation projects may also endanger the habitat and food source of dugongs, which are native to the strait.

== History ==
The Johore Strait is the location of two Victoria Cross deeds. The award was for Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser and Acting Leading Seaman James Joseph Magennis for the sinking of the 9,850-tonne Japanese cruiser &quot;Takao&quot; on 31 July 1945.

== Places of interest ==
A well known tourist attraction of the Strait of Johore&#x27;s is Lido Beach, located on the Malaysian side in Johor Bahru. Here, visitors can walk or cycle along the 2 km stretch of the beach. There are numerous restaurants and food stalls.

<text>Flitwick () is a town and civil parish in Central Bedfordshire, England.
It is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;a hamlet on the River Flitt&quot;. The spelling &quot;Flytwyk&quot; appears in 1381.

The nearby River Flit runs through Flitwick Moor, a nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Location==

It is broadly equidistant between Bedford and Luton . It shares many services with the neighbouring town of Ampthill, which lies just to the north. The boundary between the two towns is a watercourse called the Running Waters, which is now the route of the A507.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Flitwick, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Flitwick Town Council and Central Bedfordshire Council. The town council is based at the Rufus Centre on Steppingley Road, which was built in 1999.

==Shopping==

Flitwick has seen a large expansion in its population in recent years, but its retail facilities have not kept up with this growth. The local council has drawn up plans to redevelop the town centre to improve its retail offering . At present, it has a Tesco, a Co-op, which provides a secondary food source to the community and many smaller shops and estate agents, many in close proximity to the railway station. There is an open-air market every Friday selling local produce, which is set up on the car park of the village hall. The open-air market has a variety of stalls such as fishmongers, baker, haberdashery, and fruit and vegetables.

The town also opened an Aldi in September 2023.

Flitwick has four public houses: the Crown, the Swan, the Bumble Bee, and the Blackbirds. The Blackbirds is a 17th-century building with a large beer garden and children&#x27;s play area.

<doc id="286122" wikidata="Q7848162" url="?curid=286122" title="Luton Town Supporters' Trust">
<text>Luton Town Supporters&#x27; Trust is a registered industrial and provident society which acts as the supporters&#x27; trust, a democratic cooperative, for fans of the English football club Luton Town.

Trust in Luton was established in June 2003 by a group of supporters following the highly controversial takeover of Luton Town by John Gurney. Luton&#x27;s current Managing Director, Gary Sweet, was a founding member and former director of the Trust, and was part of the movement that successfully forced Gurney out by deliberately placing the club into administrative receivership.

The Trust owns 50,000 shares in the club&#x27;s holding company, Luton Town Football Club 2020 Limited, and currently holds the right of veto over any changes to the club&#x27;s identity – the only such organisation that has this right in English professional football. The Trust is also a member of Supporters Direct, a government-led trust initiative.

==History==
In May 2003, businessman John Gurney and his consortium bought Luton Town for just £4 from owner Mike Watson-Challis. One of Gurney&#x27;s first acts was to sack Luton manager Joe Kinnear and his assistant, Mick Harford – both popular figures with Luton&#x27;s supporters. Gurney outlined his vision to, among other things, build a Formula 1 track around a 70,000-capacity stadium, share the ground with NFL and NBA franchises, and to change the club&#x27;s name to &quot;London-Luton Football Club&quot; to tie in with the local airport and make it more accessible to &quot;customers&quot; living outside of Luton. Gurney also raised the possibility of Luton merging with Wimbledon, a club located over 40 miles away, in order to secure a position in the league above. This proposed destruction of the club&#x27;s history and culture led to a group of supporters establishing Trust in Luton to protect the future of Luton Town and provide a unified voice to protest against Gurney&#x27;s involvement. The Trust successfully convinced many supporters and local sponsors to vote with their feet and refuse to buy season tickets or invest in the club for the 2003–04 campaign, with the money (totalling almost £300,000) instead pledged towards the Trust. The club was later revealed to be losing £500,000 a month and, by July 2003, the players and staff had not been paid for two months. Combined with The Football League withholding television and league sponsorship money due to the ongoing uncertainty, there was a very real threat that the club would be declared bankrupt within a matter of weeks.

The Trust devised a strategy and began to acquire shares in the club&#x27;s major creditor, &quot;Hatters Holdings&quot;, an offshore company that was owed several million pounds by the club. &quot;Hatters Holdings&quot;, now majority-owned by a combination of Trust in Luton and prominent supporter spokesman Gary Sweet, deliberately placed the club into administrative receivership on 14 July 2003 to successfully force out John Gurney after a turbulent 55 days in charge.

As a shareholder in the club&#x27;s major creditor, the Trust was part of the group of creditors who agreed to sell the club to a consortium headed by Bill Tomlins in December 2003, with the sale completed in May 2004. The Trust was provided with a place on Luton&#x27;s board and initial success followed, as the club won promotion to the Championship under the new owners during the 2004–05 season. In June 2005, the Trust led calls for the cancellation of a planned friendly match between Luton and Milton Keynes Dons. The match was called off, with the &quot;franchise&quot; nature of MK Dons, which went against much of what the Trust stands for, cited as the primary reason for supporter disaffection.

In April 2007, Tomlins resigned his position as chairman following an investigation by the Football Association into irregular payments made by the club&#x27;s parent company, Jayten Stadium Limited, and confirmed that illegal payments had been made to incoming players&#x27; agents. The Trust&#x27;s board representative remained unaware of any illegal payments, leading to other board members at the club to apologise to Trust in Luton, stating that they had misled them as to the serious nature of the investigation and the club&#x27;s financial situation. The Trust, having since sold its share in &quot;Hatters Holdings&quot;, was powerless to act as David Pinkney was confirmed as new chairman two days after Tomlins&#x27; resignation. Relegation to League One followed a week later. In October 2007, the Trust had its seat on the board withdrawn and, a few weeks later, the club was docked ten points after entering administration. The administrators ultimately sold the club in February 2008 to the fan-backed Luton Town Football Club 2020 consortium – headed up by former Trust in Luton director Gary Sweet. The consortium had agreed a deal with the Trust for them to buy, when in a position to, 50,000 shares to ensure the club would have a greater level of fan ownership and involvement. Luton were relegated to League Two at the end of the season and then, following a 30-point deduction for financial irregularities, to the Conference Premier during the 2008–09 season.

Trust in Luton formalised the ownership of its 50,000 shares in October 2012 during a meeting with the club&#x27;s officials. The same meeting led the Trust to begin stepping up its involvement with the club, including an agreement to hold quarterly meetings with Luton directors and for the establishment of a scheme where shares could be sold to fans via the Trust. This also saw Trust in Luton start campaigning for answers from the footballing authorities for why other clubs, such as Watford, Queens Park Rangers and Portsmouth, had received lighter punishments than Luton (who had been docked 40 points in two seasons and had large fines imposed) for comparative financial misdemeanours.

In March 2014, it was confirmed that Trust in Luton had been given the legal right to veto any future changes to Luton&#x27;s identity, no matter who owns the club, including its name, nickname, colours, club crest and mascot. This step to empower Luton fans led to the Trust&#x27;s membership tripling in one day.

In November 2014, Trust in Luton merged with the long-established Luton Town Supporters&#x27; Club.

<text>Elizabeth, Princess Bibesco (born Elizabeth Charlotte Lucy Asquith; 26 February 1897 – 7 April 1945) was an English socialite, actress and writer between 1921 and 1940. She was the daughter of H. H. Asquith, the British Prime Minister, and the writer Margot Asquith, and the wife of Antoine Bibesco, a Romanian prince and diplomat. She drew on her experience in British high society in her work. A final posthumous collection of her stories, poems and aphorisms was published under the title &quot;Haven&quot; in 1951, with a preface by Elizabeth Bowen.

==Childhood and youth==
Elizabeth Charlotte Lucy Asquith was the first child of H. H. Asquith (British Prime Minister, 1908–1916) and his second wife, Margot Tennant. As candidly recorded in her mother&#x27;s 1920 autobiography, she was a precocious child of uncertain temper.

Life as the Prime Minister&#x27;s daughter thrust her into the public eye at an early age and she developed a quick wit and a social presence beyond her years. At the age of 12 she asked George Bernard Shaw to write a play to be produced by her for a charity benefit. He wrote &quot;The Fascinating Foundling&quot;, which she directed with other children as actors. 

When she was just 14, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that &quot;many members of the House have made the acquaintance of Miss Asquith and in expressing their concern for her health, have referred to her charm of manner and to the interest which she has begun already to show in political matters.&quot; As a teenager, during World War I, she was given opportunities to do &quot;good works&quot;, organising and performing in &quot;matinees&quot; for the servicemen. Her first known literary effort was a short duologue called &quot;Off and On&quot; which she performed with Nelson Keys in 1916 at the Palace Theatre. In the same year she organised a large show of portraits by John Singer Sargent at the Grafton Galleries to aid the Art Fund and a &quot;Poets&#x27; Reading&quot; in aid of the Star and Garter Fund. In 1918, she played small roles in two silent war movies by D.W. Griffith, &quot;Hearts of the World&quot; and &quot;The Great Love&quot;.

==Marriage and travels==

On 29 April 1919, she married Prince Antoine Bibesco, member of the House of Bibescu and a Romanian diplomat stationed in London, a man 22 years her senior. Taking place at St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, it was the society wedding of the year, attended by everyone from Queen Mary to George Bernard Shaw. The wedding was filmed by the newly formed British Moving Picture News organization. After the marriage, Prince and Princess Bibesco lived in Paris at the Bibesco townhouse at 45, Quai Bourbon at the tip of the Île St-Louis looking up the river toward Notre Dame cathedral. The walls of the apartment were decorated with huge canvases by Édouard Vuillard. &quot;They weren&#x27;t pictures. They were gardens into which you walked through a frame,&quot; wrote Enid Bagnold.
Antoine Bibesco was a lifelong friend of Marcel Proust and after his marriage to Elizabeth she too became a favourite of the reclusive writer. At the time of her marriage Proust wrote that she &quot;was probably unsurpassed in intelligence by any of her contemporaries,&quot; and added that &quot;she looked like a lovely figure in an Italian fresco&quot;. He would leave his house late at night to visit them, to discuss Shakespeare with Elizabeth or to gossip with Antoine until dawn. Elizabeth wrote a moving obituary for Proust in the November 1922 &quot;New Statesman&quot;. &quot;Gently, deliberately, he drew me into that magic circle of his personality with the ultimate sureness of a look that needs no touch to seal it. Insensibly you were drawn into that intricate cobweb of iridescent steel, his mind, which, interlacing with yours, spread patterns of light and shade over your most intimate thoughts.&quot; Elizabeth also travelled with her husband in his capacity as Romanian ambassador, first to Washington, D.C. (1920–1926) and then to Madrid (1927–1931). 

Their only child, Priscilla Helen Alexandra Bibesco, later Hodgson, was born in London in 1920; she died in Paris in 2004.

==Writings==
Between 1921 and 1940, Bibesco published three collections of short stories, four novels, two plays and a book of poetry. Katharine Angell, reviewing &quot;Balloons&quot; for &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1923 wrote, &quot;Elizabeth Bibesco uses for her sketches material from which Katherine Mansfield would have made short stories, and Henry James, novels ... Elizabeth Bibesco has a genius for compression – the compression into a few phrases of all the details of a situation, into a few pages of the hopes and failures of a lifetime&quot;. Her collections of short stories were reviewed on both sides of the Atlantic and her novel &quot;The Fir and the Palm&quot; was serialised in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in November and December 1924.

Bibesco&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Romantic&quot;, published in 1940, starts with a dedication to Falange Española founder Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, whom Bibesco had known during her stay in Madrid where her husband was Romanian ambassador (1927-31): &quot;To Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera. I promised you a book before it was begun. It is yours now that it is finished -- Those we love die for us only when we die--&quot;. A thorough appraisal of Bibesco&#x27;s work was written by Elizabeth Bowen in an introduction to &quot;Haven&quot;, the 1951 posthumous collection of Bibesco&#x27;s stories, poems and aphorisms. In her essay, Bowen wrote that, &quot;The Bibesco characters seem to be the inhabitants of a special milieu, in which the more ordinary taboos of feeling and brakes on speech do not operate.&quot;

==Final years==
Elizabeth was in Romania during World War II and died there of pneumonia in 1945, aged 48. She was buried in the Bibesco family graveyard on the grounds of Mogoșoaia Palace outside Bucharest. Her epitaph reads, &quot;My soul has gained the freedom of the night&quot; – the last line of the last poem in her 1927 collection. Her death was the final sorrow for her mother, Margot, who died within months of her daughter&#x27;s death. Prince Antoine, forced out of Romania after the war, never returned to his homeland. He died in 1951 and was buried in Paris. Priscilla Hodgson, the couple&#x27;s only child, continued to live at 45, Quai Bourbon until her death in 2004.

==Portraits==

Elizabeth&#x27;s portrait was painted twice by Augustus John, in 1919 and again five years later. The first painting (titled &quot;Elizabeth Asquith&quot;) shows her as a vivacious debutante in a feather stole over bare shoulders. This picture is in the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. In the second portrait, seen at right (titled &quot;Princess Antoine Bibesco&quot;), Elizabeth appears slightly weary and melancholic, her eyes averted just enough to suggest a break in her former self-confidence. She wears a mantilla given to her father by the Queen of Portugal and holds one of her own books. When shown at the Royal Academy summer show in 1924, Mary Chamot, writing in &quot;Country Life&quot;, wrote of this painting that it &quot;has the force to make every other picture in the room look insipid, so dazzling is the contrast between the mysterious darkness of her eyes and hair and the shimmering brilliance of the white lace she wears over her head.&quot;

<doc id="286125" wikidata="Q846279" url="?curid=286125" title="Patrol torpedo boat PT-109">
<text>PT-109 was an Elco PT boat (patrol torpedo boat) last commanded by Lieutenant (junior grade) John F. Kennedy, future United States president, in the Solomon Islands campaign of the Pacific theater during World War II. Kennedy&#x27;s actions in saving his surviving crew after &quot;PT-109&quot; was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer earned him several commendations and made him a war hero. Back problems stemming from the incident required months of hospitalization at Chelsea Naval Hospital and plagued him the rest of his life. Kennedy&#x27;s postwar campaigns for elected office referred often to his service on &quot;PT-109&quot;.

==Specifications==
Hubert Scott-Paine of the British Power Boat Company had developed Air Sea Rescue fast motor boats in the UK. He took his PT boat to Elco in 1939 as there was a shortage of suitable engines in the UK at the outbreak of war. British Powerboat Company continued production of his designs in Britain throughout the hostilities. The seakeeping qualities of boats and ease of construction matched to the available Packard engines made a perfect combination.

&quot;PT-109&quot; was an , 40-ton Elco motor torpedo boat (MTB), one of hundreds built by the firm between 1942 and 1945 in Bayonne, New Jersey. 

The seventh MTB of the &quot;PT-103&quot; class, her keel was laid 1942, she was launched on , and delivered to the Navy on 1942 to be fitted out in the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn. Fully loaded, she displaced , and could accommodate a crew of three officers and 14 enlisted men, with the typical crew size between 12 and 14. 

The Elco MTBs were the largest PT boats operated by the U.S. Navy during World War II. They had strong wooden hulls, constructed of two layers of mahogany planking, excellent for speed and reasonably adequate for seakeeping, but providing limited protection in combat.

===Engines===
&quot;PT-109&quot; was powered by three 12-cylinder Packard 4M-2500 marinized aero gasoline engines (one per propeller shaft), with a designed top speed of .

To accommodate three engines in the boat&#x27;s narrow beam (and improve weight distribution) they were staggered fore-and-aft, with the two outboard motors mounted with their output shafts facing forward and power transmitted through V-drive gearboxes to their respective propeller shafts. The center engine was mounted forward of the outboard pair in a conventional orientation, with power transmitted directly from its output end to an extended propeller shaft.

The engines were fitted with mufflers on the transom both to mask the engines&#x27; noise from the enemy and to improve the crew&#x27;s chance of hearing enemy aircraft. These directed the exhaust underwater at idle and extremely low speeds and were bypassed for anything faster.

===Armament===
The PT boat&#x27;s principal offensive weapon was her torpedoes. She was fitted with four torpedo tubes containing  torpedoes. They weighed each, with warheads and gave the tiny boat a punch believed at the time to be effective even against armored ships. The Mark 8, however, was both inaccurate and ineffective until its detonator was recalibrated by the Navy at the end of the war. A major issue was that even in the unlikely instance they hit their target, they rarely detonated, even when they hit at a 90-degree angle, perpendicular to their target. Also noteworthy, was that the torpedoes were slow, travelling at only , thoroughly unable to catch faster-moving Japanese vessels. In contrast, the Japanese Type 93 destroyer torpedo, later called the &quot;Long Lance&quot;, was faster at , had an accurate range of , was far more powerful with of high explosives, and unlike the Mark 8, its detonator usually worked when it hit a target.

One naval officer explained that 90% of the time, when the button was pushed on the torpedo tube to launch a torpedo, nothing happened or occasionally the motor spun the propeller until the torpedo motor exploded in the tube, showering the deck with metal fragments. For safety, a torpedoman&#x27;s mate was frequently required to hit the torpedo&#x27;s firing pin with a hammer to get one to launch. Kennedy and contemporary writers noted that torpedo mates and other PT crew were inadequately trained in aiming and firing the Mark 8 torpedoes, and were never informed of the torpedoes&#x27; ineffectiveness and low rate of detonation.

&quot;PT-109&quot; had a single  Oerlikon anti-aircraft mount at the rear with &quot;109&quot; painted on the mounting base, two open circular rotating turrets mounting twin M2 .50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns at opposite corners of the open cockpit, and a smoke generator on the transom, operated as needed when engaging the enemy at close range. The boat&#x27;s guns were used both offensively and defensively.

Seeking to augment the boat&#x27;s firepower (given the inaccuracy and unreliability of its torpedoes), the day before her final mission, Kennedy had the &quot;PT-109&quot;″s crew lash a U.S. Army 37 mm antitank gun he had bartered for to the foredeck, replacing a small, two-man life raft. Timbers used to secure the weapon to the deck later helped save their lives when used as a float while swimming over three miles to safety on an uninhabited island.

Ahead of the torpedoes on &quot;PT-109&quot; were two depth charges, omitted on most PTs, one on each side, about the same diameter and directly in front of the launchers. Though designed to be used against submarines, they were sometimes used to confuse and discourage pursuing destroyers. With Kennedy&#x27;s squadron commander, Lt. Alvin Cluster, at the wheel in storm conditions, &quot;PT-109&quot; port depth charge was knocked through the foredeck unexpectedly by an inadvertent launch of the port forward torpedo. Cluster had asked Kennedy for a turn at &quot;PT 109&quot;″s wheel, as he had only had experience with the older, Elco PTs. The torpedo stayed in the tube, half in and half out on a &quot;hot run&quot;, its propellers spinning, until Kennedy&#x27;s executive officer Ensign Leonard Thom deactivated it. &quot;PT-109&quot; returned to Tulagi for repairs to the foredeck and the replacement of the depth charge.

PT-&quot;109&quot; was not equipped with radar.

==Early operations==

&quot;PT-109&quot; was transported from the Norfolk Navy Yard to the South Pacific in August 1942 on board the Liberty ship SS &quot;Joseph Stanton&quot;. Originally Navy grey, it is believed the ship was painted a flat, dark green at Nouméa, New Caledonia after being off-loaded. She arrived in the Solomon Islands in late 1942 and was assigned to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 2 based on Tulagi island. She participated in combat operations around Guadalcanal from 1942 to 1943, when the Japanese withdrew from the island.

===Kennedy&#x27;s training in motor torpedo boats===
Despite having a chronically bad back and a history of other illnesses including abdominal pain and scarlet fever as an infant, John F. Kennedy used his father Joseph P. Kennedy&#x27;s influence to get into the war. In 1940, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Officer Candidate School had rejected him as 4-F, for his bad back, ulcers and asthma. Kennedy&#x27;s father persuaded his old friend Captain Allan Goodrich Kirk, USN, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence, to let a private Boston physician certify his son&#x27;s good health. Kennedy started out in October 1941 prior to Pearl Harbor as an ensign with a desk job for the Office of Naval Intelligence. He was reassigned to South Carolina in January 1942 because of his affair with Danish journalist Inga Arvad. On 27 July 1942, Kennedy entered the Naval Reserve Officers Training School in Chicago.

After completing his Naval Reserve Officer&#x27;s Training on , Kennedy voluntarily entered the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island, where he was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) (LTJG). In September 1942, Joseph Kennedy had secured PT Lieutenant Commander John Bulkeley&#x27;s help in placing his son in the PT boat&#x27;s service and enrolling him in their training school, after meeting with Bulkeley in a New York Plaza suite near his office at Rockefeller Plaza. Nonetheless, Bulkeley would not have recommended John Kennedy for PT boat training if he did not believe he was qualified to be a PT captain. In an interview with Kennedy, Bulkeley was impressed with his appearance, communication skills, grades at Harvard, and awards received in small boat competitions, particularly while a member of Harvard&#x27;s sailing team. Exaggerated claims by Bulkeley about the effectiveness of the PTs in combat against larger craft allowed him to recruit top talent, raise war bonds, and cause overconfidence among squadron commanders who continued to pit PTs against larger craft. But many in the Navy knew the truth; his claims that PTs had sunk a Japanese cruiser, a troopship, and a plane tender in the Philippines were false. Kennedy completed his PT training in Rhode Island on , with very high marks and was asked to stay for a brief period as an instructor. He was then ordered to the training squadron, Motor Torpedo , to take over the command of motor torpedo boat &quot;PT-101&quot;, a Huckins PT boat.

====Kennedy&#x27;s transfer to the Pacific====
In January 1943, &quot;PT-101&quot; and four other boats were ordered to Motor Torpedo Boat (RON 14), which was assigned to patrol the Panama Canal. Kennedy detached from in February 1943, while the squadron was in Jacksonville, Florida, preparing for transfer to the Panama Canal Zone. Still desperately seeking a combat assignment, and on his own volition, Lieutenant Kennedy then contacted family friend and crony, Massachusetts Senator David I. Walsh, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, who diverted his assignment to Panama, and had him sent to PT combat in the Solomon Islands, granting Kennedy&#x27;s previous &quot;change-of-assignment&quot; request to be sent to a squadron in the South Pacific. His actions were against the wishes of his father who had wanted a safer assignment.
The Allies had been in a campaign of island hopping since securing Guadalcanal in a bloody battle in early 1943. Kennedy transferred on 1943, as a replacement officer to Motor Torpedo Boat , which was based at Tulagi Island, immediately north of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Traveling to the Pacific on the large troop carrier , Kennedy witnessed a fierce air strike that killed the ship&#x27;s captain, and found Kennedy helping to hand shells to supply a large gun on board, giving him his first taste of battle. He arrived at Tulagi on and took command of &quot;PT-109&quot; on . Although &quot;PT-109&quot; was less than a year old, it had seen heavy combat service since its arrival in the Pacific, and considerable repairs were required on the boat; leading by example, Kennedy pitched in to help the crew get his vessel seaworthy. On , several PT boats of MTBRON 2, including &quot;PT-109&quot;, were ordered to the Russell Islands in preparation for the invasion of New Georgia.

After the capture of Rendova Island, the PT boat operations were moved north to a crude &quot;bush&quot; berth there on . The Rendova base held the potential for its residents to contract a host of unpleasant diseases like malaria, dengue, dysentery, and elephantiasis. The Navy men stationed there also contended with cockroaches, rats, foot diseases, ear fungus, and mild malnutrition from the monotonous and mostly canned food. On his first desk assignment with the Navy after his return to the States, Kennedy suffered from the aftereffects of malaria, colitis, and chronic back pain, all caused or aggravated by his experiences in combat or during his stay at the Rendova base.

From their crude base on the northern tip of Rendova Island, on a small spit of land known as Lumbari, PT boats conducted daring and dangerous nightly operations, both to disturb the heavy Japanese barge traffic that was resupplying the Japanese garrisons in New Georgia, and to patrol the Ferguson and Blackett Straits in order to sight and to give warning when the Japanese Tokyo Express warships came into the straits to supply Japanese forces in the New Georgia–Rendova area.

On , an attack by 18 Japanese bombers struck the base, wrecking &quot;PT-117&quot; and sinking &quot;PT-164&quot;. Two torpedoes were blown off &quot;PT-164&quot; and ran erratically around the bay until they ran ashore on the beach without exploding.

===Crew on &quot;PT-109&quot;″s last mission===
The following men were aboard on PT-109&#x27;s last mission:

* John F. Kennedy, Lieutenant, Junior Grade (LTJG), commanding officer (Boston, Massachusetts).
* Leonard J. Thom, Ensign (ENS), Ohio State football athlete, and excellent swimmer, executive officer (Sandusky, Ohio).
* George H. R. &quot;Barney&quot; Ross, Ensign (ENS), on board as an observer after losing his own boat. Attempted to operate the 37 mm gun but suffered from night blindness. (Highland Park, Illinois).
* Raymond Albert, Seaman 2/c, gunner. Killed in action by Japanese POW during a rescue mission 1943 (Akron, Ohio).
* Charles A. &quot;Bucky&quot; Harris, Gunner&#x27;s Mate 3/c (GM3) (Watertown, Massachusetts).
* William Johnston, Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate 2/c (MM2) (Dorchester, Massachusetts).
* Andrew Jackson Kirksey, Torpedoman&#x27;s Mate 2/c (TM2) Killed in collision. (Reynolds, Georgia).
* John E. Maguire, Radioman 2/c (RM2) (Dobbs Ferry, New York).
* Harold William Marney, Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate 2/c (MM2). Killed in collision, manning turret closest to impact point. (Springfield, Massachusetts)
* Edman Edgar Mauer, Quartermaster, cook, 3/c (QM3) (St. Louis, Missouri).
* Patrick H. &quot;Pappy&quot; McMahon, Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate 1/c (MM1) (Wyanet, Illinois). Only man in engine room during collision, was badly burned, but recovered from his wounds. Only member of the crew besides Kennedy mentioned by name in the song.
* Ray L. Starkey, Torpedoman&#x27;s Mate 2/c (TM2) (Garden Grove, California).
* Gerard E. Zinser, Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate 1/c (MM1) (Belleville, Illinois). Erroneously called &quot;Gerald&quot; in many publications, Zinser remained in the Navy for a career following the end of World War II, eventually retiring as a chief petty officer. The last living survivor of &quot;PT-109&quot;, he died in Florida in 2001.

===Battle of Blackett Strait===

At the end of July 1943, intelligence reports were received and decoded by Naval authorities at Kennedy&#x27;s PT base on Rendova Island indicating that five enemy destroyers were scheduled to run the night of 1–2 August. The destroyers would cruise from the Solomon&#x27;s Bougainville Island through Blackett Strait to supply provisions and bring troops to the Japanese garrison on Vila Plantation, on Kolombangara Island&#x27;s southern tip. America&#x27;s sophisticated deciphering of the Japanese naval codes had contributed to the victory at the Battle of Midway, ten months earlier, and the same technology had been used to break their code and provide the report of the Japanese destroyers expected 1–2 August. Despite the recent loss of two boats and two crewmen from a Japanese air attack on , the skippers of &quot;PT-109&quot; and 14 other boats met with Commander Thomas G. Warfield to discuss the details of a mission to head north through a cut in the reefs known as Ferguson Passage, to Blackett Strait between Gizo and Kolombongara Islands to block or attack the anticipated enemy destroyers. The resulting skirmish, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Battle of Blackett Strait,&quot; should not be confused with an earlier battle of that name fought there on 6 March 1943. Commander Arleigh Burke had been ordered to sit on the northern approach to Kolombangara with seven American destroyers to ensure the Japanese were prevented from reinforcing their garrison, though he was not on station till 12:30 a.m. All four Japanese destroyers would evade his grasp, as they arrived one hour early, before Burke had reached his post. The resulting battle would become the largest use of PT boats in the war, and the results would not be promising for the future use of PTs against Japanese destroyers.

====Failure of the PTs&#x27; torpedoes in action====
On 1 August, fifteen PT boats, &quot;PT-109&quot; among them, motored from the PT base on Rendova around 6:30 p.m. on strict but cursory orders from Rendova&#x27;s top brass, Commander Thomas Warfield. The combined PT task force was divided into four divisions of roughly four PTs each. &quot;PT-109&quot;″s &quot;B&quot; division also included PTs &quot;162&quot;, &quot;159&quot;, and &quot;157&quot;, and were stationed the farthest north of the PT divisions, nearly midway up Kolombongara Island&#x27;s western coast and around to the west. The &quot;B&quot; Division left Rendova first, leading the pack, as their station was the farthest from the Rendova base. Most of the divisions reached their station by 8:30 p.m. The fifteen PTs carried four torpedo tubes each, for a total of , and roughly half of these were fired at the four advancing Japanese destroyers protected by Japanese float planes. The Navy&#x27;s official report of the incident listed 5–6 torpedo explosions reaching the destroyer targets, but none, in fact, were actual torpedo hits. Of the twenty-four torpedoes fired by PT boats from eight PTs, not a single hit was scored against the advancing destroyers. Though each division of PTs was assigned a location likely to intercept the destroyers, several of those without radar cruised about aimlessly in the fog and darkness, unable to locate the enemy ships.

====Separation of &quot;PT-109&quot; from her division====

Lieutenant Brantingham on &quot;PT-159&quot;, leader of Kennedy&#x27;s division, and originally stationed near Kennedy, first saw radar blips indicating the southbound destroyers just arriving on the scene, and fired his torpedoes from about away. As he advanced, he did not radio &quot;PT-109&quot; to follow, leaving Kennedy and his crew behind in the darkness. All of Brantingham&#x27;s torpedoes missed the destroyers, and his torpedo tubes caused a small fire, requiring Lieutenant Liebenow&#x27;s PT, also in Kennedy&#x27;s division, to swing in front of Brantingham&#x27;s PT to block the light emitting from his burning torpedo tubes as they could have given away their location to the destroyers. Liebenow&#x27;s &quot;157&quot; fired two more torpedoes that failed to hit their target as well, then both boats laid smoke from their smoke generator and zigzagged away to avoid detection. No signal of the destroyer&#x27;s presence was ever radioed or received by &quot;PT-109&quot;, or the other boat in the division, and skippers Brantingham and Liebenow headed blindly west to Gizo Island and away from the destroyers and &quot;PT-109&quot;.

Many of the torpedoes that were fired exploded prematurely or ran at the wrong depth. The odds that a Mark 8 torpedo that made it to a destroyer would explode were less than 50%, due to faulty calibration of the detonators, a problem that was not known nor corrected by the Navy until later in the war. A few other PTs, including the leader of Division A to the south of Kennedy, intercepted the destroyers on their southbound route close to Kolombangara, but were unable to hit any with torpedoes. The boats were radioed by Warfield to return when their torpedoes were expended, but the four boats with radar fired their torpedoes first and were ordered to return to base. Commander Warfield&#x27;s concept of sending orders to the PTs in darkness by radio from away and without a view of the battle, was inefficient at best. The radar sets the four boats carried were relatively primitive, and sometimes malfunctioned. When the four boats with radar left the scene of the battle, the remaining boats, including &quot;PT-109&quot;, were deprived of the ability to determine the location or approach of the oncoming destroyers, and were not notified that other boats had already engaged the enemy.

Late in the night, &quot;PT-109&quot; and two accompanying PTs became the last to sight the Japanese destroyers returning on their northern route to Rabaul, New Britain, New Guinea, after they had completed dropping their supplies and troops at 1:45 a.m. on the southern tip of Kolombangara. The official Navy account of the incident listed radio communications as good, but PT commanders were also told to maintain radio silence until informed of enemy sightings, causing many commanders to turn off their radios or not closely monitor their radio traffic, including Kennedy.

====Rammed by &quot;Amagiri&quot;, 2 August====
By 2 a.m. on 1943, as the battle neared its end, &quot;PT-109&quot;, &quot;PT-162&quot;, and &quot;PT-169&quot; were ordered to continue patrolling the area on orders previously radioed from Commander Warfield. The night was cloudy and moonless, and fog had set amidst the remaining PTs. Kennedy&#x27;s boat was idling on one engine to avoid her phosphorescent wake being seen by Japanese aircraft when the crew realized they were in the path of the Japanese destroyer , which was heading north to Rabaul from Vila Plantation, Kolombangara, after offloading supplies and .

Most contemporary accounts of the incident, particularly the work of Mark Doyle, do not find Kennedy at fault for the collision. The lack of speed and maneuverability of &quot;PT-109&quot; while the engines were idling put the vessel at risk from passing destroyers, but Kennedy had not been warned by radio of destroyers in the area. Kennedy believed the firing he had heard was from shore batteries on Kolombangara, not destroyers, and was focused on avoiding detection by enemy seaplanes.

Kennedy said he attempted to turn &quot;PT-109&quot; to fire a torpedo and have Ensign George &quot;Barney&quot; Ross fire their newly installed 37 mm anti-tank gun from the bow at the oncoming northbound destroyer &quot;Amagiri&quot;, but Ross did not have time to load a shell into the closed breech of the weapon. &quot;Amagiri&quot; was traveling at a relatively high speed of between in order to reach harbor by dawn, when Allied air patrols were likely to appear.

Kennedy and his crew would have had less than ten seconds to get the engines up to speed to evade the oncoming destroyer, which was advancing without running lights. &quot;PT-109&quot; was struck on her starboard side at a 20-degree angle shearing off a piece of the boat, between Kolombangara and Ghizo Island, near .. There are conflicting accounts as to whether the destroyer captain had rammed PT-109 intentionally. &quot;Amagiri&quot;″s captain, Lieutenant Commander Kohei Hanami, later claimed that he intentionally turned hard to starboard and deliberately rammed &quot;PT-109&quot;, which was traveling at a steady pace towards them. However, Hanami&#x27;s superior officer, Commander of the 11th Destroyer Flotilla Captain Katsumori Yamashiro, and other crewmembers, recalled Yamashiro ordering Hanami to turn hard to port to try to avoid hitting the torpedo boat, for fear of setting off its torpedoes and damaging the ship, but being unable to avoid hitting it despite the evasive maneuver.

====&quot;PT-109&quot; explodes====
When &quot;PT-109&quot; was cut in two around 2:27 a.m., a fireball of exploding aviation fuel high caused the sea surrounding the ship to flame. Seamen Andrew Jackson Kirksey and Harold William Marney were killed instantly, and two other members of the crew were badly injured and burned when they were thrown into the flaming sea surrounding the boat. For such a catastrophic collision, explosion, and fire, there were few men lost compared to the losses on other PT boats hit by shell fire. &quot;PT-109&quot; was gravely damaged, with watertight compartments keeping only the forward hull afloat in a sea of flames.

&quot;PT-169&quot;, closest to Kennedy&#x27;s craft, launched two torpedoes, but they missed the attacking destroyer; &quot;PT-162&quot;″s torpedoes failed to launch. Both boats then turned away from the scene of the action and returned to base without checking for survivors of &quot;PT-109&quot;. No procedure had been specified by Commander Warfield for searching for survivors, or what the PT flotilla should do when a boat was lost. In the words of Captain Robert Bulkley, naval historian, &quot;This was perhaps the most confused and least effectively executed action the PTs had been in. Eight PTs fired 30 torpedoes. The only confirmed results were the loss of &quot;PT-109&quot; and damage to the Japanese destroyer &quot;Amagiri&quot;&quot; [from striking &quot;PT-109&quot;].

===Survival, swim to Plum Pudding Island, 2 August===

Kennedy was able to rescue MM1 Patrick McMahon, the crew member with the most severe wounds, which included burns that covered 70 percent of his body, and brought him to the floating bow. Kennedy also rescued Starkey and Harris, bringing them both to the bow. On instructions from Kennedy, the eleven survivors thrown from &quot;PT-109&quot; regrouped and, hoping for rescue, clung to &quot;PT-109&quot; bow section for 12 hours as it drifted slowly south. By about 1 p.m., on 2 August, it was apparent that the hull was taking on water and would soon sink, so the men decided to swim for land, starting around 1:30 p.m. As there were Japanese camps on all the nearby large islands including Kolombangara, the closest, they chose the tiny deserted Plum Pudding Island southwest of where the bow section had drifted. They placed their lantern, shoes, and non-swimmers on one of the timbers that had been used as a gun mount and began kicking together to propel it. Kennedy, who had been on the Harvard University swim team, used a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth to tow McMahon. It took five hours to swim to the island, away, which they reached without encountering sharks or crocodiles.

====Additional swims, 2, 4, and 5 August====
Plum Pudding Island was only in diameter, with no food or water. The exhausted crew dragged themselves behind the tree line to hide from passing Japanese barges. The night of 2 August, Kennedy swam to Ferguson Passage to attempt to hail a passing American PT boat. On 4 August, he and Lenny Thom assisted his injured and hungry crew on a demanding swim south to Olasana Island which was visible to all from Plum Pudding Island. They swam against a strong current, and once again, Kennedy towed McMahon by his life vest. They were pleased to discover Olasana had ripe coconuts, though there was still no fresh water. On the following day, 5 August, Kennedy and George Ross swam for one hour to Naru Island, visible at an additional distance of about southeast, in search of help and food and because it was closer to Ferguson Passage where Kennedy might see or swim to a passing PT boat on patrol. Kennedy and Ross found a small canoe, packages of crackers and candy, and a fifty-gallon drum of drinkable water left by the Japanese, which Kennedy paddled back to Olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his crew. It was then that Kennedy first spoke to native Melanesian coastwatchers Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana on Olasana Island. Months earlier, Kennedy had learned a smattering of the pidgin English used by the coastwatchers by speaking with a native boy. The two coastwatchers had finally been convinced by Ensign Thom that the crew were from the lost &quot;PT-109&quot;, when Thom asked Gasa if he knew John Kari, and Gasa replied that he worked with him. Realizing they were with Americans, the coastwatchers brought a few yams, vegetables, and cigarettes from their dugout canoe and vowed to help the starving crew. But it would take two more days for a full rescue.

==Rescue==
The rescue of &quot;PT-109&quot; was a long process, largely achieved by the work of native Solomon Island scouts who first located Kennedy and his crew. The scouts were sent by Sub-lieutenant Reg Evans, an Australian coastwatcher, who had seen the &quot;109&quot; explode from his secret observation site.

===Aerial search of &quot;PT-109&quot; sinking site===
The explosion and resulting fireball on the early morning of was spotted by Evans, who manned a secret observation post at the top of the Mount Veve volcano on Kolombangara; more than 10,000 Japanese troops were garrisoned below on the southeast portion. The Navy and its squadron of PT boats held a memorial service for the crew of &quot;PT-109&quot; after reports were made of the large explosion, but Commander Warfield, to his credit, ordered an aerial search by Royal New Zealand Air Force P-40 fighters that spotted a few remains of the wreck, but not the crew, who had already swum to safety.

====Coastwatchers Gasa and Kumana, 5 August====
Evans had been the first to dispatch islander scouts, Gasa and Kumana, in a dugout canoe late on 5 August, to look for possible survivors after decoding radio broadcasts that the explosion he had witnessed was &quot;PT-109&quot;. Gasa and Kumana had been trained by the British and Australians in search and detection and were willing to sacrifice their lives as part of their duty to the British and American troops. Native coastwatchers were used because they could avoid detection by Japanese ships and aircraft and, if spotted, would probably be taken for native fishermen.

Before they were rescued by the scouts on 8 August, Kennedy and his men survived for six days on Plum Pudding and then Olasana Island. They had eaten only a few ripe coconuts, rainwater caught on leaves, and small amounts of fresh water and Japanese cookies Kennedy had taken from Naru Island. By chance, Gasa and Kumana stopped by Naru to investigate a Japanese wreck, from which they salvaged fuel and food. They first fled by canoe from Kennedy, who with his sunburn, beard, and disheveled clothing appeared to them to be a Japanese soldier. When they later arrived on Olasana, they pointed their Tommy guns at the rest of the crew, since the only light-skinned people they expected to find were Japanese with whom they could not communicate.

====Thom&#x27;s and Kennedy&#x27;s rescue messages====
Kennedy&#x27;s message scratched on a coconut while he was on Naru, where he had spent some time from 4–7 August, was not the only communication given to the coastwatchers. A more detailed message was written by the executive officer of &quot;PT-109&quot;, Ensign Leonard Jay Thom on 6 August. Thom&#x27;s message was a &quot;penciled note&quot; written on paper, which read:

To: Commanding Officer--Oak O
From:Crew P.T. 109 (Oak 14)
Subject: Rescue of 11 (eleven) men lost since Sunday, in enemy action. Native knows our position &amp; will bring P.T. Boat back to small islands of Ferguson Passage off NURU IS. A small boat (outboard or oars) is needed to take men off as some are seriously burned.
Signal at night three dashes (- - -) Password--Roger---Answer---Wilco If attempted at day time--advise air coverage or a PBY could set down. Please work out a suitable plan &amp; act immediately. Help is urgent &amp; in sore need. Rely on native boys to any extent
Thom
Ens. U.S.N.R
Exec. 109.
Though the 1963 movie depicted Kennedy offering a coconut inscribed with a message as his idea and the sole form of communication, it was Gasa who suggested it and Kumana who climbed a coconut tree to pick one. On the instructions of Gasa, Kennedy painstakingly scratched the following message on the coconut husk with a knife:

NAURO ISL
COMMANDER... NATIVE KNOWS POS&#x27;IT...
HE CAN PILOT... 11 ALIVE
NEED SMALL BOAT... KENNEDY
====Coastwatchers&#x27; canoe trip from Olsana to the PT base, 6 August====
On 6 August, Gasa and Kumana left Olasana and headed east, carrying the penciled note and Kennedy&#x27;s coconut message to Wana Wana Island, south of Kolombangara and a quarter of the way to Kennedy&#x27;s PT Naval base on Rendova Island. There they took little time to rest but linked up with Senior Scout Benjamin Kevu who they told they had found the crew of &quot;PT-109&quot;. Kevu sent another scout to inform Evans, north on Kolombangara Island, of the discovery. Gasa and Kumana departed Wana Wana with scout John Kari in a better canoe given them by Kevu, carrying both Thom&#x27;s and Kennedy&#x27;s messages to a military outpost on Roviana Island, close to the PT Rendova base in a total of fifteen hours by paddling their canoe all night through of rough seas and hostile waters patrolled by the Japanese. From the content of the messages, it is clear both Thom and Kennedy trusted the coastwatchers with their lives, as neither message contained the exact coordinates of their location, nor the name of Olasana Island. Traveling in an arranged boat, Gasa and Kumana were at last sent south to the PT base at Rendova from Roviana Island, a distance of only , with Gasa still clutching the coconut. Around 6 August, after speaking to Kevu about the eleven found on Olasana, Evans sent a canoe with fresh fish, yams, potatoes, corned beef hash, and rice to Kennedy and his crew with a message to return to him on Kolumbangara&#x27;s Gomu Island in the canoe immediately. Kennedy followed this request and was the only one of his crew to go, since there were many Japanese planes flying above and the coast watchers&#x27; station was on the Japanese-occupied island of Wana Wana. Kennedy was instructed to lie underneath palm fronds in the canoe so he would not be spotted by Japanese planes. It was not until the morning of 7 August that Evans was able to radio Rendova to confirm the news that Kennedy and his crew had been discovered.

====Battle of Vella Gulf, Admiral Halsey, 6–7 August====

On the night of 6–7 August, while Kennedy still awaited rescue, Admiral William Halsey, now convinced that PTs were unsuitable against Japanese destroyers, sent six U.S. Navy destroyers equipped with more advanced radar to intercept the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;, again on their frequent run to Kolombangara Island. This time, the U.S. forces succeeded and sank four Japanese destroyers, two of which, the &quot;Arashi&quot; and &quot;Hagikaze&quot;, had eluded Kennedy and the 14 PT crews on the night of 1–2 August. This action became known as the Battle of Vella Gulf.

====&quot;PT-157&quot; makes final rescue, 8 August====
On 7 August, when the coastwatcher scouts carrying the coconut and paper message arrived at Rendova, PT Commander Warfield was at first skeptical of the messages and the trustworthiness of the native scouts Gasa and Kumana. After finally receiving Evans&#x27; radioed message of the discovery of the &quot;109&quot; crew, and facing overwhelming evidence that Kennedy had returned from the dead, he cautiously consented to risk two PTs to rescue them. Warfield selected &quot;PT-157&quot;, commanded by Kennedy&#x27;s friend and former tentmate Lieutenant William Liebenow, for the rescue, as he and his crew were experienced and familiar with the area. Liebenow later said that his crew were chosen because they were &quot;the best boat crew in the South Pacific.&quot; &quot;PT-171&quot; would travel ahead and radio Liebenow of any sightings of the enemy. Departing just after sunset from Rendova at 7:00 p.m. on 8 August, Liebenow motored &quot;PT-157&quot; to Evans&#x27; base at Gomu Island, off Kolombangara. To avoid making a wake, Liebenow traveled at , muffled his engines, and zigzagged to prevent being tracked by planes or shore batteries. The arranged signal when Liebenow picked up Kennedy on Gomu was four shots, but since Kennedy only had three bullets in his pistol, Evans gave him a Japanese rifle for the fourth signal shot. With Kennedy aboard, &quot;PT-157&quot; rescued the weak and hungry &quot;PT-109&quot; crew members on Olasana Island in the early morning of 8 August, after dispatching rowboats to pick them up. The &quot;157&quot; then motored the full crew and the coastwatcher scouts back to the Rendova PT base where they could begin to receive medical attention.

===Aftermath===
There were reporters aboard &quot;PT-157&quot;, when they rescued Kennedy and his crew from Olasana Island. After the rescue, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced, &quot;KENNEDY&#x27;S SON IS HERO IN PACIFIC AS DESTROYER SPLITS HIS BOAT&quot;. Other papers wrote &quot;KENNEDY&#x27;S SON SAVES 10 IN PACIFIC&quot;, and &quot;SHOT FROM RUSTY JAP GUN GUIDES KENNEDY RESCUERS&quot;. All the published accounts of the PT-109 incident made Kennedy the key player in rescuing all 11 crew members and made him a war hero. His father, Joseph Kennedy Sr., made sure that these articles were widely distributed, and that it was known that his son was a hero. The articles focused on Kennedy&#x27;s role in the incident, omitting most of the contributions of Thom, the crew, and the coastwatchers.

Thom, Ross, and Kennedy were each awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, though senior officer Lt. Commander Alvin Cluster had recommended Kennedy for the Silver Star. Kennedy was also awarded the Purple Heart for injuries he sustained in the collision. Following their rescue, Thom was assigned as commander of &quot;PT-587&quot; and Kennedy was assigned as commander of &quot;PT-59&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;PTGB-1&quot;). Kennedy and Thom remained friends, and when Thom died in a 1946 car crash, Kennedy was one of his pallbearers.

The &quot;PT-109&quot; incident aggravated Kennedy&#x27;s ongoing health issues. It contributed to his back problems, until his symptoms eventually progressed to a point where they were incapacitating. The incident also contributed to his gastrointestinal problems.

The coconut shell came into the possession of Ernest W. Gibson Jr., who was serving in the South Pacific with the 43rd Infantry Division. Gibson later returned it to Kennedy. Kennedy preserved it in a glass paperweight on his Oval Office desk during his presidency. It is now on display at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts.

A 2003 article in &quot;Naval History&quot; raised the possibility that Kennedy and McMahon conspired to mask the cause of &quot;109&quot;’s failure to evade &quot;Amigiri&quot;. It examined Kennedy&#x27;s supposed statement to another PT officer that &quot;109&quot; had stalled because its muffler flaps had not first been opened when its engines had been throttled up. If, as radioman Maguire reported decades later, Kennedy signaled McMahon to speed up, it would have been McMahon&#x27;s duty—and Kennedy&#x27;s responsibility—first to open the flaps, which, in the other officer&#x27;s account, were closed for quiet running. &quot;[A]t no time did [Kennedy] ever officially or publicly acknowledge having sent a signal to the engine room to increase speed. ... [McMahon] consistently played ignorant of any signal from Kennedy.&quot;

==Gasa and Kumana in later life==

Both Solomon Islanders Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana were alive when visited by &quot;National Geographic&quot; in 2002. They were each presented with a bust and a letter from the Kennedy family.

Kennedy invited both Gasa and Kumana to his inauguration, but the island authorities gave their trip to local officials instead. Kumana and Gasa made it to the airport in Honiara, but were turned back by Solomon Island officials on the grounds that their appearance and pidgin English would be an embarrassment. Gasa and Kumana gained recognition, especially after being mentioned and praised by &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and the publication of William Doyle&#x27;s book on &quot;PT-109&quot;. Gasa died in late August 2005, his death noted only in a single blog post by a relative.

In 2007, the commanding officer of USS &quot;Peleliu&quot;, Captain Ed Rhoades, presented Kumana with gifts, including an American flag, for his actions more than 60 years earlier.

In 2008, Mark Roche visited Kumana and discussed the &quot;PT-109&quot; incident. Kumana had been a scout for the Coastwatchers throughout the war, and besides rescuing the crew of &quot;PT-109&quot;, he had rescued two downed American pilots who parachuted into the sea. Kumana noted that Kennedy visited him several times while still stationed at Rendova and always brought trinkets to swap. Kumana lived atop a cliff on his native island with his extended family. His most prized possession was a bust of President Kennedy later given him by the Kennedy family. Kumana gave Roche a valuable family heirloom, a large piece of Kustom Money, to place on the President&#x27;s grave. (Among other uses, Kustom Money was used to pay tribute to a chief, especially by placing it on the chief&#x27;s grave.) In November 2008, Roche placed the tribute on the President&#x27;s grave in a private ceremony. The artifact was then taken to the Kennedy Library and placed on display beside the coconut with the rescue message.

Kumana died on 2014, exactly 71 years after &quot;PT-109&quot;″s collision with &quot;Amagiri&quot;. He was 93.

==Search for the remains of &quot;PT-109&quot;==
The wreckage of &quot;PT-109&quot; was located in May 2002, at a depth of , when a National Geographic Society expedition headed by Robert Ballard found a torpedo tube from wreckage matching the description and location of Kennedy&#x27;s vessel. The boat was identified by Dale Ridder, a weapons and explosives expert on the U.S. Marine Forensics Panel.

The stern section was not found, but a search using remote vehicles found the forward section, which had drifted south of the collision site. Much of the half-buried wreckage and grave site was left undisturbed in accordance with Navy policy. Max Kennedy, JFK&#x27;s nephew, who joined Ballard on the expedition, presented a bust of JFK to the islanders who had found Kennedy and his crew.

&quot;National Geographic&quot; produced a TV special titled &quot;The Search for Kennedy&#x27;s PT 109&quot;. A DVD and book were also released.

===&quot;PT-109&quot; and American–Japanese relations===
Nine years after the sinking of &quot;PT-109&quot;, U.S. Representative John Kennedy, engaged in a race for the Senate, instructed his staff to locate Kohei Hanami, Commander of the &quot;Amagiri&quot;, the Japanese destroyer that had run down the &quot;109&quot;. When they found Captain Hanami, Kennedy wrote him a heartfelt letter on 15 September 1952, with wishes of good fortune for him and for long-term peace between Japan and the United States. The two became friends, and Hanami subsequently went into politics in 1954, being elected as councilman of Shiokawa, and later as mayor in 1962. Hanami hoped to meet Kennedy on his next visit to Japan, and though the meeting never took place, the United States and Japan remained close allies. Years later, Caroline Kennedy accepted the post of Ambassador to Japan, holding the office from November 2013 to 18 January 2017, extending the positive relationship with Japan her father had begun after the war.

While Kennedy was running for president in 1960 he met with Fujio Onozeki, a Japanese naval officer who was aboard the &quot;Amagiri&quot; when it hit &quot;PT-109&quot;, who gave him a card signed by other officers from the &quot;Amagiri&quot;.

===&quot;PT-109&quot; in popular culture===
President Kennedy presented &quot;PT-109&quot; tie clasps to key supporters in his 1960 campaign, as well as to close friends and staff members. Replicas of the tie clasps are still sold to the public by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. An original flag from &quot;PT-109&quot; is now kept in the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum. The story of &quot;PT-109&quot;″s sinking was featured in several books and a 1963 movie, &quot;PT 109&quot;, starring Cliff Robertson. Kennedy&#x27;s father, Joe Kennedy Sr., had a role in the production, financing, casting, and writing. As there were only a few 80-foot Elco &quot;PT-103&quot;-class hulls in existence by that time (none in operable condition or resembling their World War II appearance), United States Air Force crash rescue boats were modified to resemble &quot;PT-109&quot; and other Elco PTs in the movie. Instead of the dark green paint used by PT boats in the Western Pacific theater during World War II, the film versions were painted the same gray color as contemporary U.S. naval vessels of the 1960s.

A song titled &quot;PT-109&quot; by Jimmy Dean reached on the pop music, and on the country music charts in 1962, making it one of Dean&#x27;s most successful recordings.

Eroni Kumana named his son &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. Plum Pudding Island was later renamed Kennedy Island. A controversy arose when the government sold the land to a private investor who charged admission to tourists. &quot;PT-109&quot; was also the subject of toy, plastic, and radio control model ships in the 1960s, familiar to boys who grew up as baby boomers. It was still a popular Revell &quot;PT-109&quot; (model) kit in the . Hasbro also released a &quot;PT-109&quot; edition John F. Kennedy G.I. Joe action figure, dressed in Navy khakis with a miniature version of the famous coconut shell.

Two episodes of the World War II–themed television series &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, which began airing during the Kennedy presidency, mention the &quot;PT-109&quot; and its unnamed captain from Massachusetts (whose speech and accent Ensign Parker imitate in one episode). In one episode, the boat&#x27;s captain is the ultimate choice to be the face of a congresswoman&#x27;s bond selling tour, and in the other, Captain Binghamton lists the &quot;PT-109&quot;″s captain as someone who has recently been promoted and of whom he is envious.

A video game marketing itself as a torpedo boat simulation was released by Spectrum Holobyte in 1987 with the title &quot;PT-109&quot;.

<doc id="286133" wikidata="Q1573507" url="?curid=286133" title="USS Minneapolis–Saint Paul (SSN-708)">
<text>USS &quot;Minneapolis–Saint Paul&quot; (SSN-708), a , was the first vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the metropolitan area of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, although each city had been honored twice before. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 31 October 1973 and her keel was laid down on 20 January 1981. She was launched on 19 March 1983 sponsored by Mrs. Penny Durenberger (wife of Senator David Durenberger), and commissioned on 10 March 1984, with Commander Ralph Schlichter in command.

While &quot;Minneapolis–Saint Paul&quot; was the first vessel named for the Twin Cities as a whole, she is the third ship to be named for Minneapolis as well as the third to be named for Saint Paul. The previous , was the last big-gun heavy cruiser in the United States Navy, and held the distinction of having fired World War II&#x27;s final (naval) shots.

== History ==
&quot;Minneapolis–Saint Paul&quot; took part in Operation Desert Shield and the Gulf War and was the first submarine to carry Tomahawk missiles specifically designated for use in strikes against Iraq during the Gulf War.

Four crew members were washed overboard by heavy waves on 29 December 2006 in Plymouth Sound, England, as the ship was exiting HMNB Devonport on the surface following a port call. This resulted in the deaths of Senior Chief Petty Officer Thomas Higgins (Chief of the Boat) and Sonar Technician (Submarines) 2nd Class Michael Holtz. After the preliminary investigation, Commander Edwin Ruff, the commanding officer, received a punitive letter of reprimand and was relieved of command.

&quot;Minneapolis–Saint Paul&quot; conducted inter-fleet transfer from Norfolk, Virginia, to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, in July 2007 for decommissioning. Custody of &quot;Minneapolis-Saint Paul&quot; was transferred to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in August 2008.
In 2022, the submarine&#x27;s sail and rudder were shipped to Minnesota and are undergoing restoration at the Minnesota Military Museum for display at their new facility in 2025.

<doc id="286135" wikidata="Q2302353" url="?curid=286135" title="USS Memphis (SSN-691)">
<text>USS &quot;Memphis&quot; (SSN-691), a , was the sixth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Memphis, Tennessee. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 4 February 1971 and her keel was laid down on 23 June 1973. She was launched on 3 April 1976 sponsored by Mrs. Cathy Beard (née Rieniets), wife of Congressman Robin L. Beard, Jr., and commissioned on 17 December 1977, with Commander G. Dennis Hicks in command.

In March 1981, &quot;Memphis&quot; completed an around-the-world cruise via the Panama Canal, including operations with both the Sixth and Seventh Fleets.

&quot;Memphis&quot; was redesignated an experimental submarine during 1989 to test composite hull structures, unmanned underwater vehicles, advanced sonars, hull friction reduction, and other advanced technologies for the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and classes, but remained combat-capable.

During a mid-1990s refit, &quot;Memphis&quot; received numerous modifications, which added about 50 tons to her displacement, most of it aft.
* a glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) turtleback abaft the sail to accommodate remotely operated vehicles
* a towing winch and drum for experimental towed sonar arrays
* 4.27 m-high by 1.37 m-wide vertical surfaces at the ends of the stern stabilizers to accommodate sonar transducer arrays
* a 54 mm towed array dispenser in the port fin leading to the new winch abaft the sail
* supports for the stern stabilizers
* new hydraulic systems
* a fiber-optic databus
* 58 standardized equipment racks to accommodate electronic test gear

In February 1993 &quot;Memphis&quot; ran aground offshore of Dania Beach, Florida. The grounding caused physical damage to the reef substrate and biological damage to the coral community, which was of the Holocene era and with no recent framework growth over 6,000 years. The State of Florida sued the U.S. Navy for $2.4 million, and was awarded $750,000 for mitigation and repairs.

In January 1994 &quot;Memphis&quot; entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for refueling, overhaul and modifications to support her research and development role. Upon completion of the shipyard availability she was assigned to Submarine Development Squadron 12 in Groton, Connecticut.

In 1998 &quot;Memphis&quot; tested the Lockheed Martin Undersea Systems Universal Gravity Module (UGM) passive bottom profiler navigational system.

On 3 May 2005, &quot;Memphis&quot; deployed conducting two polar transits, returning to New London on 3 November 2005.

&quot;Memphis&quot; won the coveted Battenberg Cup in 2005, as well as the Squadron 12 Battle E.

On 6 May 2006, &quot;Memphis&quot; deployed against Iraqi insurgency, returning to New London, Connecticut, on 7 August.

On 27 June 2007, &quot;Memphis&quot; returned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for a Pre-Inactivation Restricted Availability. She returned to Groton on 8 May 2008.

After 33 years of service &quot;Memphis&quot; was taken out of service in a decommissioning ceremony at the Shepherd of the Sea Chapel located at the US Submarine Base in Groton, Connecticut on 1 April 2011. &quot;Memphis&quot; went to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to begin the inactivation process.

Parts from the decommissioned &quot;Memphis&quot; were to be used to repair the damaged , until the decision to cease work on &quot;Miami&quot; was made in August 2013.

==Cheating controversy==
In November 2010, Navy investigators discovered rampant cheating taking place on training exams among the sub&#x27;s crew. The sub&#x27;s skipper, Commander Charles Maher was removed. Thirteen other crewmembers were also removed. Navy officers interviewed by the Associated Press stated that training exam cheating was widespread within the Navy&#x27;s submarine force.

<doc id="286136" wikidata="Q598581" url="?curid=286136" title="USS Dallas (SSN-700)">
<text>USS &quot;Dallas&quot; (SSN-700) is a nuclear-powered attack submarine of the United States Navy. She was the Navy&#x27;s second vessel of that name, and the first to be named after the city of Dallas, Texas. The first , a destroyer, was named for 19th century US Naval officer Captain Alexander Dallas. Another two ships with the name were scheduled but never completed. On 4 April 2018, after nearly 37 years of commissioned service, the boat was decommissioned at the Controlled Industrial Area of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The defueled vessel will eventually undergo recycling.

==Service history==
The contract to build &quot;Dallas&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 31 October 1973 and her keel was laid down on 9 October 1976. She was launched on 28 April 1979, sponsored by Mrs. Rita Crocker Clements, wife of former Deputy Secretary of Defense Bill Clements, and commissioned on 18 July 1981. &quot;Dallas&quot; was the first submarine of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class to be originally built with an all-digital fire control (tracking and weapon) system and sonar system. After commissioning, &quot;Dallas&quot; was attached to Submarine Development Squadron 12 in New London, Connecticut, where she was involved in research and development projects.

On 27 August 1981 &quot;Dallas&quot; damaged her lower rudder when she ran aground while approaching the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center site at Andros Island, Bahamas. The submarine worked herself free after several hours and returned on the surface to New London, Connecticut, for repairs.

From September 1988 &quot;Dallas&quot; was a member of Submarine Squadron 2, New London. During her time with Squadron 2, she completed the first ever Depot Modernization Period and various overseas deployments.

&quot;Dallas&quot; completed an Engineered Refueling Overhaul (ERO) at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, in 1998. The D1G-2 core was replaced with a D2W core. &quot;Dallas&quot; has had a removable Dry Deck Shelter for over a decade. This large chamber, fitted aft of the sail, has an array of air, water and hydraulic systems that allow &quot;Dallas&quot; to employ the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle, a highly mobile and virtually undetectable means of carrying out special forces missions.

&quot;Dallas&quot; has completed one deployment to the Indian Ocean, four Mediterranean Sea deployments, two Persian Gulf deployments, and seven deployments to the North Atlantic.

===Museum and delayed inactivation===

Naval Sea Systems Command, the city of Dallas and the Dallas Navy League began discussions in 2008 for items from the boat in support of a memorial. These will become available during the actual vessel recycling phase, which is scheduled for 2023 for &quot;Dallas&quot;.
Originally, it was planned to decommission &quot;Dallas&quot; in September 2014. In May 2013, officials with the city of Dallas, Texas, announced a plan to create a maritime museum more than from the nearest body of water in which a submarine can operate. Mayor Mike Rawlings and members of a foundation formed to create the new facility revealed one of their goals is to acquire and display &quot;Dallas&quot; next to a museum building.

In 2013, the US Navy announced that the plan to retire &quot;Dallas&quot; had been extended to Fiscal Year 2017 and that instead, would begin inactivation in early 2015. The US Navy projected to save $10 million in Pre-Inactivation Restricted Availability (PIRA) costs as a result of the change.

The Dallas Maritime Museum, to be located along the banks of the Trinity River, is planned to contain some components of the original boat, such as her sail, although there is some discussion about moving the entire submarine to the museum if the money can be raised.

The Dallas Navy League had planned to host the four-day inactivation ceremony, to take place in Galveston, Texas, on 7 April 2017. The Navy League subsequently reported that this public relations event was canceled by the US Navy, citing &quot;budgetary constraints&quot; while operating under a continuing resolution. Additionally, costs to the City of Dallas and/or the US Navy from leasing back already-allocated pier space were judged as excessive. The requirement to compensate commercial shipping companies for their already-reserved commercial pier space resulted from the Navy&#x27;s on-again/off-again planning cycle for the inactivation ceremony, which ultimately was re-canceled.

== Awards ==
&quot;Dallas&quot; received two Meritorious Unit Commendations, two Navy Unit Commendations and was awarded the Battle Efficiency E for FY 1986, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1999, 2000 and 2013. Further recognition includes nomination for the 1993 Battenberg Cup as the best all-around ship in the fleet and the 1999 Engineering &quot;E&quot; and Medical &quot;M&quot;.

== In fiction ==

*&quot;Dallas&quot; features prominently in the 1984 Tom Clancy novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and the 1990 film adaptation.
*&quot;Dallas&quot; is featured along with her sister boat in the John Ringo novel &quot;Under a Graveyard Sky&quot;.
*&quot;Dallas&quot; is featured in the popular 2009 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; in the mission &quot;The Only Easy Day... Was Yesterday&quot;, alongside when they were part of the Sixth Fleet.

<doc id="286137" wikidata="Q1971557" url="?curid=286137" title="USS La Jolla">
<text>USS &quot;La Jolla&quot; (SSN-701/MTS-701), a , is named for the La Jolla community in San Diego, California. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 10 December 1973 and her keel was laid down on 16 October 1976. She was launched on 11 August 1979 sponsored by Mrs. Jean Bryant Wilson, wife of Congressman Bob Wilson, and commissioned on 24 October 1981. In 2017, &quot;La Jolla&quot; was converted to a Moored Training Ship and is currently stationed at NPTU Charleston in Goose Creek, SC.

==Service history==
During the sea trials for &quot;La Jolla&quot;, an unexpected depth excursion occurred during a propulsion plant &quot;crash back&quot; test at the direction of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. In late 1982, about 30 miles out of San Francisco, &quot;La Jolla&quot;, while at periscope depth, collided with the submarine , operating on the surface. &quot;La Jolla&quot; suffered minor rudder damage, while putting a scrape in the paint on &quot;Permit&quot;″s keel. &quot;La Jolla&quot; was the first to successfully test fire a Tomahawk cruise missile while submerged at the Pacific Missile Test Center on 29 April 1983.

The first West Pacific (West-Pac) cruise was between August 1984 and February 1985, in which &quot;La Jolla&quot; visited ports in Olongapo Philippines, Hong Kong, Chinhae Korea, and Yokosuka, Japan. All crew members participating in the second half of the 1984–85 West-Pac cruise received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for operations in the Sea of Japan.

On 11 February 1998, about 9 miles out of Chinhae, South Korea, &quot;La Jolla&quot; accidentally ran into and sank a 27-ton fishing trawler. The five crewmembers of the trawler were rescued by the crew of &quot;La Jolla&quot;. In 2000, &quot;La Jolla&quot; was modified to carry a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS). On 23 August 2004, &quot;La Jolla&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor after a six-month deployment in the Pacific Ocean. She conducted port visits in Korea, Japan, Singapore, Saipan, and Guam, and participated in five international exercises, including Pacific Reach 2004.

==Post stand-down conversion to training ship==

&quot;La Jolla&quot; was converted to a Moored Training Ship (MTS) in August 2017 and decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 November 2019. The conversion to a MTS began in February 2015 and completed in late 2019. After a &quot;Fast Cruise&quot; period in the spring of 2020, &quot;La Jolla&quot; was certified and cleared for student training. The conversion to a MTS was expected to take 32 months according to the commanding officer, however it took much longer. During her time in shipyard, the submarine was cut into three pieces, and a portion of the hull taken out. Three new hull sections from General Dynamics Electric Boat were added to accommodate the sub&#x27;s new mission. A newly fabricated hull section was welded in place, and the new compartment (OPS, or Operations) contains training spaces, office spaces, and an emergency safeguard system. &quot;La Jolla&quot; is permanently moored at Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) at Naval Support Activity Charleston in South Carolina.

<text>USS &quot;Augusta&quot; (SSN-710), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for Augusta, Maine. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 31 October 1973 and her keel was laid down on 1 April 1983. She was launched on 21 January 1984 sponsored by Mrs. Diana D. Cohen, wife of U.S. Senator William Cohen and commissioned on 19 January 1985.

== 1986 collision ==
The Department of Defense reported that &quot;Augusta&quot; required $2.7 million worth of repairs due to damage in an undersea collision while on a routine training patrol. On 31 October 1986 &quot;Augusta&quot; entered dry-dock at Electric Boat to have her sonar dome replaced and the repairs were completed on 13 December 1986.

The Soviet Navy claims that on 3 October 1986, &quot;Augusta&quot; collided with the 667AU Nalim (Yankee-I) class ballistic missile submarine &quot;K-219&quot;, commanded by Igor Britanov, off the coast of Bermuda. The U.S. Navy states that &quot;K-219&quot; was disabled by an internal explosion.

CBS news reported that &quot;Augusta&quot; &quot;very possibly&quot; collided with a Soviet submarine.

== Later service ==
In July 1987, &quot;Augusta&quot; began service as a trials boat for the BQG-5D Wide Aperture Array (WAA) passive sonar system and carrying the prototype BQQ-10 ARCI sonars, which incorporate off-the-shelf computer components, allowing easy introduction of modular upgrades.

In 2003, &quot;Augusta&quot; was part of a small group of submarines participating in Tomahawk Strikes against Iraq in the opening of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The boat successfully launched missiles against all assigned missions leaving the theater with 100% completion.

&quot;Augusta&quot; underwent extensive maintenance during 2006 to prepare for six-month deployment in 2007, which began in March and completed in September. &quot;Augusta&quot; changed her homeport to Norfolk Naval Shipyard, where she began decommissioning in January 2008, and completed the disassembly of her reactor on 24 November 2008.

<text>Giuseppe Abbamonte (1759–1818) was a Neapolitan statesman who became secretary-general of the Cisalpine Republic in 1798 and a member of the Executive Committee at Naples. Upon the restoration of the king in 1799, he moved to Milan where he continued to do his job until 1805.

==Biography==
While living in Naples he adhered to the Jacobin ideals. The Jacobins were very different politically than those who held power at the time. They were radical in the time of change during the revolution. In 1794, after being involved in a conspiracy, he was forced to flee to Oneglia. He then lived in Loano and Milan, where he published the &quot;Saggio leggi fondamentali dell&#x27;Italia libera&quot; (Essay on the fundamental laws of Italian liberty) in 1797. In Milan he also founded the &quot;Giornale dei Patrioti italiani&quot; (Newspaper of the Italian patriots) and collaborated with the &quot;Monitore italiano&quot; (Italian monitor).

In 1798 he became general inspector of the ministry of police of the Cisalpine Republic, but later on, he was arrested for causing political conflicts.

After the proclamation of the Neapolitan Republic, despite being absent from the city, he was called up to be a part of the provisional government. He arrived in Naples in the second half of February 1799, and organized the court of justice. He was at first appointed as a Chairman of the Central Committee, and later of the Executive Committee.

He participated in the defence of the city against the Sanfedist troops. The full name of the Sanfedismo troops was the Army of Holy Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. This group was a peasant army that became popular and wanted to resist the new French republic. After the surrender, he was supposed to go to Toulon together with the other Neapolitan patriots, but the winning party broke the agreement and imprisoned them. Abbamonte was sentenced to death by the State Council but, because he surrendered, the punishment was changed to life imprisonment.

He was liberated in 1801 and went to Milan, and in the end returned to Naples permanently when Joseph Bonaparte became king of the city. Here he held important roles in the magistracy and was later appointed as state counsellor by Joachim Murat. After the restoration, he still remained in the city, under the reign of Ferdinando, and was appointed as counsellor of the supreme court of justice.

<text>USS &quot;Providence&quot; (SSN-719), a , is the fifth vessel of the United States Navy to be named for Providence, Rhode Island. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 16 April 1979 and her keel was laid down on 14 October 1982. She was launched on 4 August 1984 sponsored by Mrs. William F. Smith, and commissioned on 27 July 1985.

&quot;Providence&quot; is the first &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class submarine to be equipped with the Tomahawk missile Vertical Launch System (VLS). While others used test boxes and programs, &quot;Providence&quot; was the first submarine to launch a Tomahawk cruise missile from the VLS system using its combat system CCS MK1 and associated software Program C4.1.

==History==
&quot;Providence&quot; has been deployed several times to the Western Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Persian Gulf. Some of the ports visited have included Port Canaveral (Cocoa Beach, Florida) and Port Everglades (Fort Lauderdale, Florida), Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, Tromsø, Norway, Halifax, Canada, Gibraltar, Toulon, France, Souda Bay, Crete, La Maddalena, Italy, and Koper, Slovenia, in the Mediterranean, and al-Manama, Bahrain, and both Dubai and Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf. The submarine has made transits of the Suez Canal in 1998, 2001, and 2003 and participated in Operation Southern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where she earned the nickname &quot;Big dog of the Red Sea wolf pack.&quot;

She has since been retrofitted with numerous upgrades including the AN/BYG-1 Fire Control system and AN/BQQ-10 ARCI Sonar suite. Her achievements continued in 2006–2007 as she has also completed an around-the-world deployment to the Western Pacific Ocean earning the coveted Order of Magellan certificate, participating in Exercise MALABAR 2006, and many other significant assignments. Port visits included Singapore, Yokosuka and Okinawa in Japan, Goa in India, as well as transits through both the Suez Canal and Panama Canal.
In 2008, she completed another deployment to the Western Pacific Ocean, only this time taking a northern route, successfully transiting under the arctic ice cap. On 1 July 2008 she surfaced at the North Pole to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the historic feat of the in 1958.

On March 19, 2011, Providence launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at Libyan air defenses as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn.

With the decommissioning of on 21 May 2021, &quot;Providence&quot; became the oldest active &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine in the US Fleet. She was then assigned to Submarine Squadron 12 at US Naval Submarine Base New London, Groton, Connecticut.

==Inactivation and decommissioning==
On 20 August 2021, a Change of Homeport ceremony was held at the Naval Submarine Base New London, in Groton, Connecticut. &quot;Providence&quot; was then transferred to Kitsap Naval Base in Bremerton, Washington for decommissioning after 37 years of service. &quot;Providence&quot; was officially placed in reserve status, inactivated but in commission on 2 December 2021. The submarine was officially decommissioned on 15 August 2022 (although she was decommissioned on 22 August 2022 in the Naval Vessel Register) and the decommissioning ceremony for &quot;Providence&quot; was held on 1 September 2022.

==Awards and decorations==
*four Navy Unit Commendations
*six Meritorious Unit Commendations
*six Battle E (Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon) awards (three of which were consecutive)
*four Navy Expeditionary Medals
*two National Defense Service Medals
*three Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals
*Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal
*Global War on Terrorism Service Medal
*Sea Service Deployment Ribbon

&quot;Providence&quot; won the Tomahawk Strike Derby in 1988 with a 5-second time on target. The USS &quot;Providence&quot; was the winner of the 2008 Arleigh Burke Award for superior performance in battle efficiency, presented by Fleet Forces Command on Monday 16 June 2008. &quot;Providence&quot; has, once again, earned the coveted 2008–2009 Battle Efficiency &#x27;E&#x27; for COMSUBRON 2.

<text>USS &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; (SSN-720) is a and is the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

==History==
The contract to build &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 16 April 1979, and her keel was laid down on 15 April 1983. She was launched on 8 December 1984 and commissioned on 23 November 1985.

On 2 April 1991 &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; and conducted submarine-launched Tomahawk missile attacks against Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.

&quot;Pittsburgh&quot; departed in October 2002 for a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. There, she again fired Tomahawk missiles into Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. She returned on 27 April 2003.

On 25 February 2019, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; returned to her homeport at Naval Submarine Base New London after completion of her final deployment. The submarine then arrived at Bremerton, Washington on 28 May 2019, for a months-long inactivation and decommissioning process.
&quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was officially deactivated on 17 January 2020 at the Undersea Warfare Museum in Keyport, Washington, and awaited the Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. She was later decommissioned on 15 April 2020 and the crew released, 37 years to the day of her keel was laid down.

Of interesting note, &quot;Pittsburgh&#x27;s&quot; final Commanding Officer, was (at the time: Commander) Jason Deichler a native of Western Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh suburbs, and brought the &quot;Yinzer&quot; spirit to the &quot;SSN-720&quot;, as he said, &quot;I wear Pittsburgh on my sleeve.&quot;

<doc id="286149" wikidata="Q2006011" url="?curid=286149" title="USS Annapolis (SSN-760)">
<text>USS &quot;Annapolis&quot; (SSN-760), is the tenth &quot;improved&quot; . &quot;Annapolis&quot; is the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Annapolis, Maryland, site of the United States Naval Academy.

==History==
The contract to build USS &quot;Annapolis&quot; (SSN-760) was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 21 March 1986 and her keel was laid down on 15 June 1988. She was launched on 18 May 1991 sponsored by Mrs. Myra F. Kauderer, and commissioned on 11 April 1992, with Commander Richard Severinghaus in command.

Completing sea trials in April 1992, the ship had her first port visit to her namesake city, Annapolis, Maryland. She then entered Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) in January 1993. After completing PSA in July 1993, the ship had her first port visit to Bermuda.

In November 1993, USS &quot;Annapolis&quot; deployed on her first mission to the North Atlantic. Later that year she was awarded the Submarine Group Two Silver Anchor Award for enlisted retention. &quot;Annapolis&quot; returned to Groton, Connecticut for the Christmas holidays and then continued on deployment in the North Atlantic in January 1994. During this time the boat made her first visit to Bergen, Norway where some members of the crew had an opportunity to attend a few of the 1994 Winter Olympics events, including the Men&#x27;s Gold Medal hockey match, before returning to Groton in March. During this deployment the boat and crew earned the Navy Arctic Service Ribbon. Following an in-port refit period, &quot;Annapolis&quot; participated in a six-month pre-deployment workup with , and on 20 October 1994, began her first six-month Mediterranean Deployment with the &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; Battle Group. During the deployment, the crew had a chance to make port calls in places as diverse as Gibraltar; Toulon, France; La Maddalena, Italy; Limasol, Cyprus; and Haifa, Israel. During this deployment &quot;Annapolis&quot; earned her first Sea Service Ribbon, Navy Expeditionary Medal and Meritorious Unit Commendation. Upon the boat&#x27;s return, &quot;Annapolis&quot; was &quot;adopted&quot; by the town of Montville, Connecticut in an effort to strengthen community relations.

The boat&#x27;s next deployment was not until October 1997, when she returned to the Mediterranean Sea with the &quot;George Washington&quot; Battle Group. In November 1997, in response to an emergent political and military crisis in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Annapolis&quot; transited the Suez Canal en route to the Middle East. While on station, &quot;Annapolis&quot; played a key role as a Tomahawk strike platform as well as serving as a public affairs platform by hosting news crews from both ABC and CBS networks.

Port calls were limited but the crew did get ashore in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. While in the Persian Gulf, the boat earned her second Sea Service Ribbon and a Naval Unit Commendation. In March 1998 &quot;Annapolis&quot; was relieved of her duties by and began the long voyage home.

After more than two years of local operations and extensive upkeep, &quot;Annapolis&quot; transited back to the Mediterranean in the summer of 2000 for a six-month independent submarine deployment. While in the Mediterranean, the boat had a chance to participate in several multi-national exercises as well as in real-world operations in the Adriatic. Crew members had significant liberty in Gibraltar; Rota, Spain; Toulon, France; and La Maddalena, Italy, and earned its third Sea Service Ribbon and second Naval Expeditionary Medal. The boat returned from this deployment in January 2001.

&quot;Annapolis&quot; entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for an extended overhaul on 23 April 2003. She set sail 16 May 2004, after completing a Depot Modernization Period one month ahead of schedule.

On 28 February 2008, &quot;Annapolis&quot; returned to homeport Groton from a six-month deployment. The deployment included visits to Rota, Spain; Toulon and Brest, France; Praia, Cape Verde; and Ghana. &quot;Annapolis&quot; was the first U.S. submarine to make a port visit to Africa (Cape Verde) outside the Mediterranean. In addition to functions supporting national security, &quot;Annapolis&quot; participated in the African Partnership Station (APS) 2007, an initiative with regional maritime services in West and Central Africa.

In March 2009 &quot;Annapolis&quot; took part in Ice Exercise 2009.

In April 2015, the boat entered an Extended Engineered Overhaul where she went through several modernizations both in the forward compartment, as well as in the engineroom. The boat returned to Groton in June 2017.

In January 2018, the boat transited the Panama Canal for her change of homeport to Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, CA.

In February 2018, she was homeported in San Diego, California, and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11.

Following a predeployment work up period, Annapolis set out on her maiden Western Pacific Deployment in March 2019. She made port in Yokosuka, Japan; Sasebo, Japan; and Guam. She returned to San Diego in September 2019.

In April 2022, she was homeported to Apra Harbor, Guam, and assigned to Submarine Squadron 15.

<text>Max Wertheimer (; April 15, 1880 – October 12, 1943) was a psychologist who was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, along with Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Köhler. He is known for his book &quot;Productive Thinking&quot; and for conceiving the phi phenomenon as part of his work in Gestalt psychology.

Wertheimer became interested in psychology and studied under Carl Stumpf at the University of Berlin. Wertheimer then went on to obtain his PhD in 1904 under Oswald Külpe, at the University of Würzburg and then began his intellectual career teaching at the Institute for Social Research at Frankfurt University. For a short time, he left Frankfurt to work at the Berlin Psychological Institute, but returned in 1929 as a full professor.

Wertheimer eventually joined the faculty of The New School in New York, a position he held until his death. One of Wertheimer&#x27;s postdoc researchers was the American psychologist Abraham Maslow who greatly admired Wertheimer.

==Early life (1880–1903)==
Max Wertheimer was born on April 15, 1880, in Prague, then part of Austria-Hungary. He was born to Wilhelm and Rosa Wertheimer, second to his brother Walter. Wilhelm Wertheimer was an educator and financier. Rosa Wilhelm, born Rosa Zwicker, had a rich classical education. The Wertheimers were active in the Jewish community in which they lived. The Wertheimer household was extremely intellectual, therefore Max received education from both his parents; he engaged in political and educational discussions at home, as well as taking piano and violin lessons. After he received one of Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s books as a gift, he developed an interest in philosophy. He felt that he and Spinoza shared a culture and common traits.

Wertheimer began his formal education aged five, at a private elementary school maintained by the Piarist order of the Roman Catholic Church. It was not uncommon at this time for Jewish children in central Europe to receive educations from the Catholic Church. Aged ten, he graduated from the Piarist Grammar School and enrolled in the Royal Imperial New City German State High School, where he could expect to obtain a degree that would qualify him for admittance to a university. Due to the diverse courses offered by the university, he began to contemplate his future, and realized his deep fascination with philosophy. He first began to study law at Charles University, where he also explored philosophy, and other fields such as music, physiology, and psychology. After a year, Max left and enrolled in University of Berlin where he shifted his study to philosophy. At Berlin, Max was able to work in the company of figures such as Carl Stumpf, Friederich Schumann, Georg Elias Müller, and Erich von Hornbostel. Later on, in 1903, he gained his PhD from the University of Würzburg. There he completed research on the lie detector.

==Time in Frankfurt and Berlin (1910–1933)==

Max Wertheimer began his academic career at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt, later to become the University of Frankfurt. From 1910 to 1916 he worked there and conducted pioneering experiments in the perception of motion and phi phenomenon. Wertheimer first founded his Gestalt theory before World War I, publishing his research on perception in &quot;Experimental Studies on Motion Vision&quot; in 1912. During World War I Wertheimer was a research psychologist with the Prussian Artillery Testing Commission, the center of which was located in the Bavarian Quarter of Berlin, close to Albert Einstein&#x27;s house. Wertheimer&#x27;s friendship with Einstein began at this time, in his visits he attempted to understand the Gestalt-like processes Einstein had used to conceive the theory of relativity. In the war years Wertheimer also became friends with physicist Max Born. After the war, Wertheimer united with Born and Einstein to negotiate the release of the rector and some professors at the University of Berlin who were being held by students and soldiers making socialist demands from the university.

After the war, he further advanced his Gestalt theory in collaboration with Wolfgang Kohler, Kurt Koffka, and others through the Weimar years. He left Frankfurt from 1916 to 1929 to work at the Berlin Psychological Institute. He gave lectures and pursued his research on perception and gestalt in the University of Berlin. In 1923, while teaching in Berlin, Wertheimer married Anna Caro (called Anni), a physician&#x27;s daughter, with whom he had four children: Rudolf (who died in infancy, 1924), Valentin (1925–1978), Michael (1927–2022) and Lise (born 1928, Lisbeth Rosa). He returned to Frankfurt in 1929 as a full professor, where he stayed until 1933.

== Time after leaving Germany (1933–1943) ==
In 1933, the change in Germany&#x27;s government convinced Wertheimer to leave Germany. He heard Adolf Hitler&#x27;s declarations and he felt his Jewish roots placed him in danger. The Wertheimer family joined other German emigres and moved to the United States. The Wertheimers&#x27; emigration was arranged through the U.S. consulate in Prague, and he and his wife and their children arrived in New York harbor on September 13, 1933. The family became citizens as well; that&#x27;s why Max Wertheimer is referred to as a German-American psychologist. Along with his move to America, Wertheimer accepted a professional position at age fifty-three at the New School for Social Research in New York City. The New School had been founded only fourteen-years before when he gained the opportunity to teach courses there, remaining at the New School for the last decade of his life. From 1934–1940, Wertheimer wrote four major papers, philosophical essays on the topics of truth, ethics, democracy, and freedom which are all commonly grounded on gestalt ideas of the whole and its parts, and the importance of looking at the &quot;total situation.&quot;

In America he remained in touch with his European colleagues, many of whom had also emigrated to America. Kurt Koffka was teaching at Smith College; Wolfgang Köhler at Swarthmore College; and Kurt Lewin at Cornell University and the University of Iowa. Although in declining health, Wertheimer continued to work on his research of problem-solving, what he preferred to call &quot;productive thinking.&quot; Max and Anna Wertheimer divorced in 1942. He completed his only book, &quot;Productive Thinking&quot; in late September 1943. He died from a heart attack just three weeks after the book&#x27;s completion at his home in New Rochelle, New York. Wertheimer is interred in Beechwoods Cemetery, also in New Rochelle. He was the father of Michael Wertheimer, also a psychologist.

==Phi phenomenon==
Max Wertheimer began the formal founding of Gestalt psychology in 1910 as he began experiments on the phi phenomenon. He published these experiments in a paper titled &quot;Experimental Studies on the Perception of Movement&quot;. The phi phenomenon is apparent movement caused by alternating light positions. Wertheimer illustrated this phenomenon on an apparatus he built that utilized two discrete lights on different locations. Although the lights are stationary, flashing the lights at succeeding time intervals causes the retina to perceive the light as moving. Wertheimer worked with partners Koffka and Köhler to collect data which ultimately led to their launch of the Gestalt movement. Their findings further demonstrated that the quality of the whole is different from the sum of the parts. The explanation of the phi phenomena was that movement is perceived because the eye itself moves in response to the successive flashes of light. The movement an observer experiences is based on feedback from the moving eye. The researchers maintained that human perception is prone to such illusions and they speculated that it is more meaningful to connect close-together events than to keep them artificially separate.

==&quot;Productive thinking&quot;==
As a Gestalt theorist, Max Wertheimer was interested in perception, but additionally interested in thought. These ideas formed the basis of his posthumously published book, &quot;Productive Thinking&quot; (1945). Wertheimer was interested in making a distinction between reproductive thinking and productive thinking. Reproductive thinking is associated with repetition, conditioning, habits or familiar intellectual territory. Productive thinking is the product of new ideas and breakthroughs. Productive thinking is insight-based reasoning. Wertheimer argued that only insightful reasoning could bring true understanding of conceptual problems and relationships. Wertheimer encouraged training in traditional logic. He believed traditional logic stimulated thinking. However, he believed that logic alone did not give rise to productive thinking. He believed creativity was also crucial to engage in productive thinking. In &quot;Productive Thinking,&quot; similar to his lectures, Wertheimer used concrete examples to illustrate his principles. Wertheimer used these illustrations to demonstrate the transition from S1, a state where nothing really seems to make sense, to S2, where everything seems clear and the concept grasped. He points out in &quot;Productive Thinking&quot; that solving a problem by blind obedience to rules prevents real understanding of the problems. He believes that this blind obedience forestalls a person from uncovering the solution. Max Wertheimer&#x27;s ideas of productive thinking are of continuing relevance in modern ideas of schemas, plans, and knowledge structures today.

==Gestalt theory==

Wertheimer developed his Gestalt theory in 1910 while he was on board a train from Vienna for a vacation in Germany&#x27;s Rhineland. Gestalt, in the closest English definition of the term, is translated potentially as configuration, form, holistic, structure, and pattern. According to Gestalt psychology, perception is a whole. In this sense, perception can shape vision and the other senses. In addition, the theory also maintained that the whole is not only greater than its components but also different from those components. By 1920, Wertheimer added the position that the properties of any parts are governed by the structural laws of the whole. Later efforts to discover such laws had limited success. Wertheimer&#x27;s work on gestalt psychology with his colleagues at The New School was seen as an opposition and alternative to the behavioral approach to psychology.

Wertheimer started the cognitive school of psychology. His ideas also challenged structuralism and atomism, in that he and other gestalt psychologists were more concerned about the whole rather than small structures or fragments of an object.

== Four major papers from 1934 to 1940 ==
After leaving Germany, Wertheimer was preoccupied with the dilemmas of his time. He wrote four major papers on values he felt were threatened: truth, ethics, democracy and freedom, respectively. In 1934 Wertheimer published &quot;On Truth&quot;, in which he made a distinction between Truth (T), which is understood within its full situation, and piecemeal truth (t) :&quot;A thing may be true in the piecemeal sense, and false, indeed a lie, as a part in its whole.&quot; He believed in the importance of the &quot;will to truth&quot; and the need look at the &quot;total situation&quot; in order to live justly.

in 1935 he wrote &quot;Some Problems in the Theory of Ethics. Wertheimer thought poor ethics were primarily a sickness of logic, a result of &quot;piecemeal&quot; thinking, more than it was a result of a person&#x27;s inner drive toward destruction. The third paper, &quot;On the Concept of Democracy&quot; was published in 1937.

In 1940 the fourth of these papers was published, this one on the topic of freedom, titled &quot;A Story of Three Days.&quot; It was published in &quot;Freedom: Its Meaning&quot;, a collected works by many famous thinkers on the topic of freedom. A synthesis of the ideas that he wrote about in the first three papers, this one was written in the style of an autobiographical parable, like the sort of narrative seen in a pilgrim&#x27;s progress. It is Wertheimer&#x27;s &quot;final affirmation of faith in the power of Gestalt, of the will to truth and justice, to lead the world into a post-Hitler era of freedom&quot;.

<text>Wolfgang Köhler (; 21 January 1887 – 11 June 1967) was a German psychologist and phenomenologist who, like Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka, contributed to the creation of Gestalt psychology.

During the Nazi regime in Germany, he protested against the dismissal of Jewish professors from universities, as well as the requirement that professors give a Nazi salute at the beginning of their classes. In 1935 he left the country for the United States, where Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania offered him a professorship. He taught with its faculty for 20 years, and did continuing research. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Köhler as the 50th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Köhler was born in the port city of Reval (now Tallinn), Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire. His family was ethnic German, and shortly after his birth, they moved to Germany.

==Education==
In the course of his university education, Köhler studied at the University of Tübingen (1905–06), the University of Bonn (1906–07) and the University of Berlin (1907–09). While a student at the latter, he focused on the link between physics and psychology, in the course of which he studied with two leading scholars in those fields, Max Planck and Carl Stumpf, respectively. He completed his Ph.D. thesis (titled &quot;Akustische Untersuchungen&quot; [Acoustic investigations]) in 1909. His dissertation addressed certain aspects of psychoacoustics; Köhler had Stumpf as his advisor.

==Gestalt psychology==
In 1910–13, he was an assistant at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt in which he worked with fellow psychologists Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka. He and Koffka functioned as subjects for Wertheimer&#x27;s now-famous studies of apparent movement (or the phi phenomenon), which led them in turn to conclusions about the inherent nature of vision. They collaborated on the founding of a new holistic attitude toward psychology called Gestalt theory (from the German word for &quot;shape&quot; or &quot;form&quot;), aspects of which are indebted to the earlier work of Stumpf (Köhler&#x27;s teacher) and Christian von Ehrenfels (whose lectures at the University of Prague Wertheimer had attended).

In an introduction to the book, &quot;The Task of Gestalt Psychology,&quot; Carroll Pratt emphasizes Köhler&#x27;s irritation at misinterpretation of his famous quote, &quot;The whole is different from the sum of its parts&quot;. Though perhaps a simple error made in translation, many lectures in textbooks of modern-day psychology refer to Gestalt theory by saying &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. When the word &#x27;different&#x27; is used, as Köhler originally stated, it implies that the whole bears no resemblance to the parts creating it. Most psychologists, however, understand &quot;greater&quot; to mean that the relationship between the parts is &quot;itself&quot; a significant part of the whole, something that is not present in the other parts if simply summed up. Example: if all the parts of a car are laid out on the floor of a garage, they do not make up a car. Only when the factor of assembly is added to the parts, do they become a car.

==Problem solving==
In 1913, Köhler left Frankfurt for the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, where he had been named the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences anthropoid research station. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote a book on problem solving titled &quot;The Mentality of Apes&quot; (1917). In this research, Köhler observed how chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, in order to retrieve the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. Köhler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through trial-and-error (which American psychologist Edward Thorndike had claimed to be the basis of all animal learning, through his law of effect), but rather that they had an insight, in which, having realized the answer, they proceeded to carry it out in a way that was, in Köhler&#x27;s words, &quot;unwaveringly purposeful.&quot;

This is one of the prominent findings from the research done on apes. Köhler&#x27;s work on the mentality of apes was seen as a turning point in the psychology of thinking. He believed that people underestimated the influence of a number of external conditions on such higher animals. In his book, &quot;The Mentality of Apes&quot;, Köhler explains that he was inspired to work with the chimpanzees for two main reasons. The first was because the &quot;structure of their brains is more closely related to the chemistry of the human body and brain-structure than to the chemical nature of the lower apes and their brain development&quot;. He was intrigued that human traits could be observed in the everyday behaviours of this animal. Secondly, he wanted to study the chimps to gain knowledge of the nature of intelligent acts.

In the early stages of observing chimps, it was clear that the examinations should not be considered characteristic for each member of this species. Köhler recognized that, as in humans, chimpanzees demonstrated considerable differences in the intellectual field. Chimps demonstrated that they were able to grasp the objects around them in a variety of fashions. This is incorporated in their everyday playing behaviours. For this reason, it was not necessary to use experimental tests to introduce chimps to handle matter. In his book, &quot;The Mentality of Apes&quot;, Köhler describes how the apes use their hands, saying &quot;large, powerful and flexible hands are natural links between himself and the world of things, and he attains the necessary amount of muscular force and co-ordination at an earlier age than the human child&quot;.

Köhler made most of his observations during the first six months of 1914, while working with Mr. Teuber. They provided the animals with problems that would be difficult but not impossible for the chimps to solve.

The conclusions drawn from the experiments with apes were that these animals exhibit insight and that they demonstrate intelligent behaviour that is common in humans. Köhler states that these findings hold true for every member of the species. He describes that &quot;the correlation between intelligence and the development of the brain is confirmed&quot;. Köhler points out that a downfall of educational psychology at the time of the experiments with apes was that it had yet to create a test that was capable of assessing how far mentally healthy and mentally-ill children could go in particular situations. Köhler believed that studies of this type could be performed on young children, and that future research should focus on these possibilities. He stated that: &quot;where the lack of human standards makes itself so much felt, I should like to emphasize particularly the importance and- if the anthropoids do not deceive us- the fruitfulness of further work in this direction&quot;.

==Criticism of introspection==
In his book titled &quot;Gestalt Psychology,&quot; Köhler criticized the concepts of introspection, a sub-discipline in psychology that was dominant in Germany throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. Stemming from the ideas of the structuralist psychologists, introspection was defined as the self-reporting of conscious thoughts and sensations. It was believed that consciousness could be understood by breaking its elements down into basic parts.

Köhler was quick to dismiss this train of thought. He claimed that the introspectionists were too subjective in their methodologies and did not test for reliability in their findings. For example, the description of sensing the colour red made by one individual may not be the same as the description of another. Where the introspectionists failed was their inability to adequately replicate particular findings. If one person was tested for sensations regarding the colour red, these descriptions were simply shared among followers of the discipline. These descriptions were automatically taken as valid, and no further testing of a particular sensation took place. In addition to this, Köhler claimed that introspection did not focus on immediate problems regarding direct human experience. He believed that an important goal of empirical science was to obtain objective results that apply to almost everyone. The introspectionists, according to Köhler, did not consider objective experience a key point in their science.

==Opinions on behaviorism==
Köhler was also vocal in his stance against behaviorism, another competing school of thought in North America. At the time, behaviourism focused solely on overt acts that were easily observable and measurable. Inner thoughts, feelings, and processes that occurred between the presentation of a stimulus and the onset of behaviour were considered part of a black box not easily understood. This black box, which could be described as cognition today, was not accessible and therefore should be discarded from psychology as being something unimportant. Köhler criticized the behaviourists&#x27; dismissal of direct experience. They said that it was not measurable, and therefore did not contribute to the furthering of human understanding.

Köhler analyzed the difference between overt and covert behaviours. He argued that the behaviourists focused solely on overt behaviours in order to make inferences concerning human functioning. Using his background in physiology, Köhler suggested that covert behaviours (such as heart rate and blood pressure) could offer additional insight into how we function and interact with the environment. In &quot;Gestalt Psychology&quot;, Köhler describes advancements made in physiological research and the tools created to measure covert behaviours. Covert behaviours such as increased heart rate could provide additional insight into how people interact with particular stimuli. The behaviourists, according to Köhler, never adequately utilized these new instruments to make sound inferences on human behaviour.

Köhler argued against the idea that direct experience was not measurable or usable. Drawing upon his personal experience and interest in the field of physics, Köhler posed the example of two physicists observing a galvanometer (an instrument that detects and measures electric current) and making inferences based on the information it provides. According to Köhler, behaviourists act in a similar way when observing behaviours. One behaviourist will observe a behaviour and share results, leading to an extension of these findings by others in the field. While behaviourism denies direct experience, Köhler suggests that behaviourists are unknowingly accepting it in this regard. Just as the galvanometer is independent of the physicist, so is the subject from the behaviourist. Direct experience results in the observation of phenomena and leads to results. In this regard, he felt that the standpoint of the behaviourists appears somewhat paradoxical.

==Berlin Psychological Institute==
Köhler returned to Germany in 1920, and soon after was appointed the acting director, and then (as Carl Stumpf&#x27;s successor) professor and director of the Psychological Institute at the University of Berlin, where he remained until 1935. In those fifteen years, his accomplishments were considerable, including, for example, the directorship of the school&#x27;s prestigious graduate program in psychology; the co-founding of an influential journal about perceptual psychology, titled &quot;Psychologische Forschung&quot; (Psychological Research: Journal of Psychology and its Neighboring Fields); and the authorship of an early book titled &quot;Gestalt Psychology&quot; (1929), written especially for an American audience. During the 1920s and early 1930s psychology reached a high point at the institute. Aside from Köhler, many other influential minds were at work. Max Wertheimer was part of the institute from 1916 to 1929, until he left to take a position in Frankfurt. In addition, Kurt Lewin remained at the institute until 1933 (the year of his resignation). Köhler also had many well-known assistants at the institute, including Karl Duncker, whose work revolved around problem solving and induced movement. Von Lauenstein, another assistant of Köhler, is known mainly for his investigation of time errors and memory. Finally, von Restorff is best known for her collaboration efforts with Köhler on both the isolation effect and theory of recall.

==Nazi Germany==
The Nazi party, led by Adolf Hitler, rose to power on January 30, 1933. The regime started practicing discriminatory policies against Jews, and dismissed any professors with a Jewish background from German universities. Max Planck, the well-known physicist, petitioned Hitler to stop the dismissal of Jewish professors, stressing their importance regarding scientific contributions. Hitler has been quoted as responding to Planck, &quot;if the dismissal of Jewish scientists means the annihilation of contemporary German science, then we shall do without science for a few years&quot;.

Köhler did not make a public stand against the Nazi regime until the end of April 1933. During the beginning of that month, he still expressed ambivalence as to how serious a threat was posed by the regime. He was wary, but did not become more active against the Nazis until they forced the dismissal of Karl Planck, another well-known experimental physicist. On April 28, 1933, Köhler wrote an article titled &quot;Gespräche in Deutschland&quot; (Conversations in Germany). It was written for the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; and is officially the last published article that openly attacked the Nazi Regime during their reign.

After the article was published, Köhler expected immediate arrest. But, the Nazis did not come for him. Even four months after the article was originally published, reprints were still being distributed. Köhler received numerous letters from Jews and non-Jews, expressing their gratitude and admiring his courage. To strengthen his stance against the Nazis, Köhler also sought assistance from his colleagues. To his disappointment, many of his colleagues refused to become involved in the anti-Nazi movement. Some suggested the Nazis would not be able to take over the large and complex German political system. In addition, some colleagues argued that Köhler&#x27;s resistance fell outside their particular spheres of influence. In turn, they could contribute nothing.

On November 3, 1933, the Nazi government demanded that professors begin their lectures by giving the Nazi salute. Köhler thought this was a violation of his own beliefs and told his students that he was unable to engage in such an act. His explanation was met with applause, from both Nazi sympathizers and rebels alike. His situation at the institute began to deteriorate more quickly after this statement. In December 1933, Nazi officials stood outside Köhler&#x27;s seminar room. As students left, the officials stopped them and examined their student cards. Although Köhler did not interfere, he later contacted the institute rector, Eugen Fischer, complaining that an unannounced raid had occurred. After much disagreement and several more unannounced inspections of his students, Köhler took the situation further since his wishes were not being considered nor respected. He requested retirement from the institution in May 1934. This drew the attention of the Ministry and they would finally intervene in July 1934 by running an investigation of the interactions between Köhler and the rector as well as the personal attacks he received from the German student organizations.

==Later life==
After being left out of important decision making of the Psychological Institute of the University of Berlin and losing important assistants, who represented new points of view, Köhler found it impossible to continue his work. Köhler officially resigned from the Psychological Institute of the University of Berlin and emigrated to the USA in 1935. He was offered a professorship at Swarthmore College, where he served on the faculty for twenty years.

In 1956, he became a research professor at Dartmouth College. Soon after, he also served as the president of the American Psychological Association. He lectured freely in the United States and made yearly visits to the Free University of Berlin. Here, he acted as an adviser for the faculty. He kept the psychologists in touch with American psychology by collaborating with them in research and enthusiastically engaging in discussions with them. He died in 1967 in Enfield, New Hampshire.

== Family life ==
Köhler married the painter and sculptor Thekla Achenbach in 1912. They had two children in Germany (Claus, born 1912 and Marianne, born 1913) and two more when they lived in Tenerife (Peter, born 1915 and Martin, born 1918). This marriage ended in divorce and in 1927 he married Lili Harlemann by whom he had a daughter, Karin (born 1928).

<text>Steven McCaffery (born January 24, 1947) is a Canadian poet and scholar who was a professor at York University. He currently holds the David Gray Chair at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. McCaffery was born in Sheffield, England and lived in the UK for most of his youth attending University of Hull. 

He moved to Toronto in 1968. In 1970, he began to collaborate with fellow poets Rafael Barreto-Rivera, Paul Dutton, and bpNichol, forming the sound-poetry group, &quot; The Four Horsemen&quot;. Some of McCaffery&#x27;s poetry attempts to break language from the logic of syntax and structure to create a purely emotional response. He has created three-dimensional structures of words and has released a number of sound and video works, often in collaboration with other poets.

<text>Zbigniew Rybczyński (; born 27 January 1949) is a Polish filmmaker, director, cinematographer, screenwriter, creator of experimental animated films, and multimedia artist who has won numerous prestigious industry awards both in the United States and internationally including the 1983 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for &quot;Tango&quot;.

He has taught cinematography and digital cinematography, and has worked as a researcher of blue and greenscreen compositing technology at Ultimatte Corporation. He is renowned for his innovative audiovisual techniques and for his pioneering experimentation in the field of new image technology.

In March 2009, Rybczyński returned to Poland, taking up residence in Wrocław, where he set up the Center for Audiovisual Technologies (CeTA) at the site of the city&#x27;s historic Feature Film Studio. The center, which officially opened in January 2013, includes a state-of-the-art studio designed by Rybczyński for the production of multi-layer film images, and an institute for research into images and visual technologies.

After Rybczyński discovered and publicized corruption in CeTA, he was fired and subsequently declared the renunciation of his Polish citizenship.

==Early life and career==
Rybczyński was born in Łódź, Poland. He grew up in Warsaw, where he attended a secondary-level art school and then worked briefly at the |Studio Miniatur Filmowych (1968-1969). He studied cinematography at the Łódź Film School (1969-1973); his thesis films were &quot;Take Five&quot; and &quot;Plamuz&quot;. During his studies, he became a founding member of the Film Form Workshop (Warsztat Formy Filmowej), the most important Polish neo avant-garde group. He also honed his film-making skills working as a cinematographer for young directors like Andrzej Barański, Piotr Andrejew, Wojciech Wiszniewski, and Filip Bajon on shorts, documentaries and educational films, and on Grzegorz Królikiewicz&#x27;s feature-length &quot;The Dancing Hawk&quot; (&quot;Tańczący Jastrząb&quot;). His films from the period include: &quot;The Talk&quot; (&quot;Rozmowa&quot;, TV) and &quot;Gropingly&quot; (&quot;Po Omacku&quot;) by Andrejew, &quot;Videocassette&quot; (&quot;Wideokaseta&quot;) by Bajon, and &quot;Wanda Gościmińska. Włókniarka&quot; by Wiszniewski. From 1973 to 1980, Rybczyński made his own films at the Se-Ma-For Studio in Łódź. He established the Dr. Stanzl special effects studio in Vienna for the Austrian public TV station ORF, and worked there from 1977 to 1980. During the political unrest in Poland in 1980, he was the head of the founders&#x27; committee of the Se-Ma-For studio branch of Solidarity.

==Emigration to the United States==
In 1982, during the martial law period, he managed to arrange a job contract that enabled him to leave Poland for Vienna, where he applied for political asylum. The following year, he and his family emigrated to the US, where they lived in Los Angeles and then New York. The first works he made in the US were the short experimental videos &quot;The Day Before&quot; and &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Diplomacy&quot;, both made in 1984 on a commission from NBC&#x27;s &quot;The New Show&quot;. In 1985, he launched his own studio – ZBIG VISION – in New York, which he subsequently outfitted with the latest video, computer and HDTV technology. It was in this studio that he made his most important American films, including &quot;Steps&quot; (1987), &quot;The Fourth Dimension&quot; (1988), &quot;The Orchestra&quot; (1990), &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1991), and &quot;Kafka&quot; (1992), which were showered with enthusiastic critical acclaim and numerous awards. In the, US he also made short music-based pieces that added to his popularity and acclaim. Between 1984 and 1989, he made more than 30 music videos for such artists as Mick Jagger, Yoko Ono, Lou Reed, Simple Minds, Cameo, Art of Noise, Chuck Mangione, Pet Shop Boys, Lady Pank, The Alan Parsons Project, Supertramp, and Rush. One of them – &quot;Imagine&quot; (1986), made for John Lennon&#x27;s composition – was the first music video ever made using high-definition technology.

In 1994, Rybczyński moved to Germany, where he co-founded the Centrum Für Neue Bildgestaltung, an experimental film center in Berlin, and later worked in Cologne. He returned to Los Angeles in 2001, where he worked for the Ultimatte Corporation and continued his research in the area where art, science, and digital technology intersect working out new standards for moving images. Among the results of Rybczyński&#x27;s long-term research and experimentation are his inventions in the field of electronic-image technology, for which he holds several US patents, and which are widely used in the film and TV industries.

In March 2009, Rybczyński returned to Poland, taking up residence in Wrocław, where he set up the Center for Audiovisual Technologies (CeTa) at the site of the city&#x27;s historic Feature Film Studio. The center, which officially opened in January 2013, includes a state-of-the-art studio designed by Rybczyński for the production of multi-layer film images, and an institute for research into images and visual technologies.

Rybczyński was a professor at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne (1998-2001), and has also taught at many other art and film schools, including the National Film School in Łódź, Columbia University in New York, and Yoshiba University of Art and Design in Tokyo.

In 2014, Rybczyński settled on a two acre ranch near Tucson, Arizona. Together with his wife, Dorota Zglobicka who is also a filmmaker, Zbig created Gila Monster Studios. Currently, they are in pre-production for their upcoming feature film, &quot;The Designer&quot;.

==Awards==

Rybczyński has won numerous prestigious awards at international film festivals including Oberhausen (1981), Tampere (1982), Kraków (1981), and the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival (1993). He won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1983 for his film &quot;Tango&quot;, the first-ever Oscar awarded to a Polish artist. (The awards ceremony was notable for Rybczyński, as after he left the ceremony to step outside for a smoke, he was barred entry by a security guard even though he was holding an Oscar statuette. A scuffle ensued, and Rybczyński was arrested. His summation of the event was that &quot;success and failure are quite intertwined.&quot;)

He has also received three MTV Video Music Awards, three American Video Awards, three Monitor Awards (1984-1987), an MTV Video Vanguard Award for &quot;being visionary in the field of music video&quot; (1985–86), a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Award (1986), a Silver Lion at the Cannes Advertising Film Festival (1987), an Emmy Award (1990), a Prix Italia (1990), and the Grand Prize at the International Electronic Cinema Festival, Tokyo-Montreux (1990 and 1992). In 2010, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the development of international cinematic art at the Batumi International Art-House Film Festival (BIAFF) in Georgia.

In 1999, Rybczyński was honored with a star in the Łódź Walk of Fame. In 2008, the Łódź Film School awarded him an honorary doctorate &quot;for outstanding artistic skill and innovation in the cinematic arts and for the creative use of the potentials of art, technology and science&quot;. In the same year, Poland&#x27;s Minister of Culture and National Heritage awarded him the Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis for Cultural Achievements, and he also received the prestigious Katarzyna Kobro Award for artistic achievement.

Rybczyński&#x27;s first solo exhibition – &quot;A Treatise on the Visual Image&quot;, shown in 2009 at Art Stations in Poznań, the WRO Art Center in Wrocław, and the Center of Contemporary Art Znaki Czasu in Toruń – focused attention on his unique artistic and scientific achievements, presenting his work in the context not only of film, but of contemporary fine arts.

Rybczyński was also active in an avant-garde group &quot;Warsztat Formy Filmowej&quot;, and had cooperated with Se-Ma-For Studios in Łódź, where he authored a series of short films, including: &quot;Plamuz&quot; (1973), &quot;Zupa&quot; (1974) and &quot;Nowa książka&quot; (1975).

After winning the Academy Award for &quot;Tango&quot;, Rybczyński moved to New York and embarked on a career directing music videos in the early years of MTV. Rybczyński created dozens of music videos for artists including Art of Noise, Mick Jagger, Simple Minds, Pet Shop Boys, Chuck Mangione, The Alan Parsons Project, Yoko Ono, Lou Reed, Supertramp, Rush, Propaganda, and Lady Pank. His clip for John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; was created as a showpiece for HDTV technology. Rybczyński won several MTV Awards, including the coveted Video Vanguard Award for his radical contributions to the form.

Rybczyński is a recognized pioneer in HDTV technology. In 1990, he produced the HDTV program &quot;The Orchestra&quot; for the Japanese market. This suite of classical music videos won many awards (including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects). The program, created in HDTV, was broadcast in standard resolution by PBS as part of their &quot;Great Performances&quot; series in the US, as HDTV was not widely available to viewers until a decade later. Segments of this program are regularly featured on the Classic Arts Showcase channel in the U.S.

Frustrated with the quality of available chroma key technology — the process of removing a specific color frequency from film and video that had become essential to his work — Rybczyński began to author his own chromakey software in the 1990s. This led to an R&amp;D position with the Los Angeles Ultimatte Corporation, longtime industry leaders in chromakey technology.

<text>Glycerides, also known as acylglycerols, are esters formed from glycerol and fatty acids, and are generally very hydrophobic.

Glycerol has three hydroxyl functional groups, which can be esterified with one, two, or three fatty acids to form mono-, di-, and triglycerides. These structures vary in their fatty acid alkyl groups as they can contain different carbon numbers, different degrees of unsaturation, and different configurations and positions of olefins.

Vegetable oils and animal fats contain mostly triglycerides, but are broken down by natural enzymes (lipases) into mono and diglycerides and free fatty acids and glycerol.

Soaps are formed from the reaction of glycerides with sodium hydroxide. The product of the reaction is glycerol and salts of fatty acids. Fatty acids in the soap emulsify the oils in dirt, enabling the removal of oily dirt with water.

Partial glycerides are esters of glycerol with fatty acids, where not all the
hydroxyl groups are esterified. Since some of their hydroxyl groups are free their molecules are polar. Partial glycerides may be monoglycerides (two hydroxyl groups free) or diglycerides (one hydroxyl group free).
Short chain partial glycerides are more strongly polar than long chain partial glycerides, and have excellent solvent properties for many hard-to-solubilize drugs, making them valuable as excipients in improving the formulation of certain pharmaceuticals.
The most common forms of acylglycerol are triglycerides, having high caloric value and usually yielding twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrate.
== Acylglyceride linkage ==
An acylglyceride linkage is the covalent bond between the organic acid groups (such as fatty acid) and one of the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol.

<text>Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) is a transit agency serving the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex of Texas. It operates buses, light rail, commuter rail, and high-occupancy vehicle lanes in Dallas and twelve of its suburbs. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

DART was created in 1983 to replace a municipal bus system and funded expansion of the region&#x27;s transit network through a sales tax levied in member cities. DART light rail began operation in 1996 and operates over of track. It was the longest light rail system in the United States until 2022, when it was surpassed by Los Angeles Metro Rail with the opening of the K Line.

DART jointly operates the Trinity Railway Express commuter rail line between Dallas and Fort Worth, with Trinity Metro. The agency also operates the Dallas Streetcar and provides funding for the non-profit M-Line Trolley.

== History ==
=== Precursor agencies ===
The Dallas Transit System (DTS) was a public transit service operated by the city of Dallas, from 1964 to 1983. DTS was formed by the consolidation of various privately owned transit companies and streetcar lines. Prior to DTS, the company was formerly known as the Dallas Railway and Terminal Company when Dallas had an extensive streetcar system that spanned from Oak Cliff to North Dallas. The name was changed shortly after the last streetcar ran in January 1956. DART formally took over operations of the DTS in 1988.

In 2000, DART employees restored a 1966 DTS bus to its original state.

=== Creation of DART ===
DART was created on August 13, 1983, as a regional replacement for the DTS (Although the name &quot;Dallas Area Rapid Transit&quot; was intended to reflect the new agency&#x27;s coverage of the greater Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, its acronym DART almost immediately evoked comparisons to San Francisco&#x27;s Bay Area Rapid Transit system, known as BART). Citizens of 15 area cities had voted to levy a 1% sales tax to join the system by the time it began transit services in 1984 (though the formal acquisition of the Dallas Transit System wouldn&#x27;t be complete until 1988).

In 1985, member cities Carrollton and Farmers Branch held elections to pull out of DART, though the measures failed. But shifting suburban politics and a loss of confidence in DART management after voters declined to support DART&#x27;s measure to incur long term debt in 1988 led to seven more pullout votes, two of which (Flower Mound and Coppell) were successful. Just one suburb joined DART – the tiny community of Buckingham, which was later annexed by DART member city Richardson.

=== Financial scandal ===
In December 2007, DART revealed it was facing a $1 billion shortfall in funds earmarked for the Blue Line rail service to Rowlett and Orange Line rail service to Irving, and the DFW Airport.

In January 2008, DART announced it would divert monies from rail lines being built in Dallas. When Dallas officials protested, DART president and executive director Gary Thomas—who had known about the shortfall for at least eight months—announced the agency would borrow more money.

In late January 2008, DART Board chair Lynn Flint Shaw, who was also treasurer of Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert&#x27;s &quot;Friends of Tom Leppert&quot; fund-raising committee, resigned from her DART post. In February, she surrendered to the police on charges of forgery. On March 10, Shaw and her husband, political analyst Rufus Shaw, were found dead in their home in what turned out to be a murder suicide.

=== 2016 shooting ===

On July 7, 2016, one DART officer was among several people shot in a mass shooting targeting police officers providing security at a Black Lives Matter protest. One of the officers, identified as seven-year veteran Brent Thompson, died from his injuries and became the first DART officer to be killed in the line of duty since the department&#x27;s inception.

=== New bus network ===
On January 24, 2022, DART&#x27;s bus network, which had dated back to DART&#x27;s 1983 incorporation, was completely overhauled. The overhaul, branded as DARTzoom, was intended to improve the bus system&#x27;s service reach, frequency, and hours of operation. All DARTzoom local routes would be available 5 AM to midnight, seven days a week. The centerpiece of the system was 22 &quot;core frequent&quot; routes, which would be available from 4 AM to 1 AM with 20-minute headways for most of the day and 15-minute headways during peak periods.

DARTzoom saw many short or low-use routes consolidated or removed, and bus stops were re-organized to be a constant distance apart. Eliminated routes were usually replaced with GoLink zones. The system also introduced a new route numbering scheme, which assigned route numbers and colors based on a route&#x27;s frequency, rather than the previous network&#x27;s type designations. Only one route (883, a shuttle route sponsored by the University of Texas at Dallas) retained its original designation.

To celebrate the new network and allow riders time to adjust, all rides on the new network were free for the first week of operation.

== Light rail ==
DART&#x27;s light rail system comprises between four lines, which connect northern suburbs, South Dallas neighborhoods, and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport to Downtown Dallas. The system utilizes custom-built Kinki Sharyo SLRV vehicles, which are electrically powered and feature level boarding in the center segment of the car.

As of , DART light rail has average weekday boardings, making it the 7th-most ridden light rail system in the U.S.

Before the 1983 membership election, DART created a plan for of rail. After several cities (specifically Duncanville, Grand Prairie, and Mesquite) voted not to join the agency and a 1988 bond plan to fund the system failed, DART settled on a pared-down system, consisting of of light rail and of commuter rail. The first two light rail lines in the system, the Red and Blue Lines, opened in 1996.

== Streetcars ==
=== Dallas Streetcar ===

The Dallas Streetcar is a modern streetcar connecting downtown Dallas to Methodist Dallas Medical Center and Bishop Arts District in northern Oak Cliff. The line connects to DART&#x27;s and at EBJ Union Station. The line is owned by the city of Dallas and operated by DART under a joint funding agreement.

The streetcar line was built in two phases from May 2013 to August 2016. An extension of the line further into downtown, which would allow for a direct connection to the M-Line Trolley, has been proposed.

=== M-Line Trolley ===
The M-Line Trolley is a heritage streetcar line in Dallas&#x27;s Uptown neighborhood. The trolley connects to DART light rail at the Cityplace/Uptown and St. Paul stations.

The trolley service is owned and operated by the McKinney Avenue Transit Authority, a private nonprofit, but DART and the Uptown Improvement District provide a joint operating subsidy that allows the service to be fare-free.

== Commuter rail ==
=== Trinity Railway Express ===
Trinity Railway Express (TRE) is a commuter rail service connecting downtown Dallas with downtown Fort Worth. The service is jointly operated by DART and Trinity Metro, Fort Worth&#x27;s transit operator. It was first opened in 1996 and was extended to Fort Worth in late 2001.

TRE connects to all four of DART&#x27;s light rail lines, Fort Worth&#x27;s TEXRail line, and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (via bus). Service is available on weekdays and Saturdays with 30–60 minute headways. Sunday service is only available during the State Fair of Texas and other major events.

As of , the TRE has average weekday boardings, making it the 17th-most ridden commuter rail system in the U.S.

=== Silver Line ===

The Silver Line is a proposed commuter rail service that will run between Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and Plano along a former St. Louis Southwestern corridor. The line, first proposed as part of DART&#x27;s original 1983 rail plan, is currently under construction and is expected to commence service by 2026. Service will operate seven days a week with 30–60 minute headways.

=== A-train ===
The A-train is a commuter rail service connecting Denton and Lewisville to DART member Carrollton. The line is operated by the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA) on a former Missouri–Kansas–Texas corridor it leases from DART.

The A-train connects with DART&#x27;s at Trinity Mills station, which allows further travel to downtown Dallas. Both DART and DCTA sell regional-fare passes which enable travel on both lines.

== Buses ==
As of 2025, DART operates 75 bus routes, as well as several express routes and shuttle buses.

Most trips in the DART system are carried by the bus network. In the 2022 fiscal year, DART had 72,400 bus trips per average weekday, 54% of the system&#x27;s total 134,810 trips.

=== Fleet ===

DART&#x27;s fleet initially consisted of diesel buses. In 1998, the agency began using liquefied natural gas buses alongside them as part of a broader environmental initiative.

In October 2012, DART introduced a new fleet of 123 low-floor 14-to-17-passenger buses for On-Call, FLEX, and low-capacity routes. The buses were manufactured by ARBOC Specialty Vehicles.

From 2013 to 2017, DART would replace most of its bus fleet with 459 NABI 40LFW buses running off compressed natural gas. The CNG fleet was further bolstered in 2019 with the addition of 41 New Flyer Xcelsior XN40 buses.

DART introduced electric buses to its fleet in 2018. The seven Proterra Catalyst buses were originally used for the DLink shuttle in downtown Dallas. When the shuttle was eliminated in 2019, the electric buses were moved to normal routes; they are currently used on route 28 (Singleton). In 2023, DART ordered an additional Proterra bus, this time a ZX5 Max, as a trial for long-range electric buses; it is currently used on route 20 (Northwest Highway). Electric buses are denoted with a unique yellow-and-green livery.

=== Routes ===

Since the 2022 system redesign, DART has three types of routes: local, express, and shuttle. Local routes are further categorized by frequency.
=== Facilities ===
DART runs its bus system similar to the hub-and-spoke model some airlines use, with specified bus-only facilities that serve as timepoints and transfer locations for multiple routes. Many (though not all) of these facilities include park-and-ride lots, air-conditioned waiting areas, vending machines, and bathrooms. Most rail stations also serve as transfer locations for bus routes, albeit with fewer connecting routes and amenities.
* Addison Transit Center (Addison)
* Bernal/Singleton Transfer Location (West Dallas)
* Cockrell Hill Transfer Location (Cockrell Hill)
* East Transfer Center (Downtown Dallas, near Pearl/Arts District)
* Glenn Heights Park and Ride (Glenn Heights)
* Jack Hatchell Transit Center (Plano)
* J. B. Jackson Transit Center (Fair Park)
* Lake Ray Hubbard Transit Center (Garland)
* Malcolm X Boulevard Transfer Location (South Dallas)
* North Irving Transit Center (Irving)
* Northwest Plano Park and Ride (Plano)
* Red Bird Transit Center (South Dallas)
* South Garland Transit Center (Garland)
* West Transfer Center (Downtown Dallas, near West End)

== On-demand services ==

=== DART On-Call ===
In 2003, DART launched a premium on-call shuttle service to replace many low-use DART bus routes. The service allowed riders to schedule trips to and from any location within designated zones, though it required trips to be scheduled one hour in advance. DART On-Call operated only on non-holiday weekdays.

It was first opened in some North Dallas and Plano neighborhoods and, in late 2005, was expanded to Glenn Heights. When the service was retired in 2021, DART On-Call served north central Plano, eastern Rowlett, Farmers Branch, North Dallas, Lakewood, Richardson, Lake Highlands, and Glenn Heights.

=== FLEX ===

Introduced in 2008, FLEX was a hybrid of on-call and fixed-route services. The service augmented six routes with designated FLEX areas surrounding the route. A bus could be diverted to any location within its corresponding area, so long as time permitted.

In order to request FLEX service, a passenger needed to pay System fare, which cost double the typical fare. Pickups within a FLEX area needed to be scheduled an hour in advance, though drop-offs within an area could be requested at time of boarding.
=== GoLink ===
In February 2018, GoLink was introduced as a modernized on-demand service, similar to ridesharing apps. While similar to DART On-Call, GoLink allows booking through DART&#x27;s GoPass app (over-the-phone booking is still available), and it does not require trips to be scheduled one hour in advance. GoLink trips are included in DART passes, and they can also be booked individually. The service was developed in association with Uber; riders are given the choice between hailing an UberPool and a vehicle from DART&#x27;s own fleet (both at the same fare).

GoLink gradually replaced DART On-Call and FLEX services, which were eventually discontinued in 2021. The service was further expanded in 2022 to complement the revised bus network, replacing many less-traveled routes that were not carried over from the previous network.

Trips can be scheduled in 34 zones throughout DART&#x27;s service area, each of which connect to designated rail and bus stations. Travel between zones is not permitted, though some zones overlap at designated Transfer Areas. Service is available from 5 AM to midnight every day, except for the Inland Port Connect zone in southern Dallas County, which is only available from 5 AM to 8 PM on weekdays. (This discrepancy is because Inland Port Connect is operated by STAR Transit, not DART itself.)

== Paratransit ==
DART provides ADA-compliant paratransit for its member cities. Patrons with physical, cognitive, or visual disabilities can schedule curb-to-curb trips to nearby passenger facilities, such as park-and-rides or rail stations. If the disabilities are severe enough that the patron cannot use DART&#x27;s rail or bus services at all, they are able to schedule trips to any location within the member cities.

A non-ADA demand-response service, dubbed DART Rides, is available for elderly or disabled residents of Carrollton, Dallas, Plano, and Rowlett, as well as certain ZIP codes in Addison, Farmers Branch, and Irving.

=== Collin County Transit ===
Collin County Transit provides curb-to-curb service to elderly, disabled, and low-income residents of Celina, Lowry Crossing, McKinney, Melissa, Princeton, and Prosper for a fixed fare. DART operates this service on behalf of the McKinney Urban Transit District (MUTD).

== Ridership and financial performance ==
Average daily ridership for DART has been in the vicinity of 200,000 riders per day over the last couple decades. In the 1st quarter of 1998, DART&#x27;s weekday ridership averaged 211,000 riders per day system-wide. Ridership has risen and fallen since then; total ridership, including ridership, has been as high as 248,500 average weekday riders in the 3rd quarter of 2008, and as low as 194,700 average weekday riders in the 1st quarter of 2010. However, after a year-long study in 2012 that counted passenger counts through both the existing manual method and a new automated counting system, DART concluded it has been underreporting rail ridership by more than 15 percent each year. In the 4th quarter of 2012, DART reported an average weekday ridership of 252,900. In the fourth quarter of 2014, DART reported total ridership had declined to 233,900 weekday riders.

Overall, DART is one of the lowest-performing transit systems in the U.S., when measured against comparable peer cities, for number of passenger trips, operating cost per mile, and fare recovery rate. In 2016, in addition to rider&#x27;s fare payments, taxpayers paid $5.90 for each trip taken. In 2022, about 3% of DART&#x27;s operating income came from passenger fares, compared to 61% from local sales taxes and 18% from COVID-19 relief grants.

In addition to fares and sales tax revenue, DART has raised funds by issuing bonds. Following a referendum in 2000, DART was given the authority to issue $2.9 billion in bonds over a 15-to-20 year period. In 2012, a court ruled that DART could exceed this limit so long as the debt is not solely backed by sales taxes. The most recent bond issue occurred in 2021, consisting of two series for a total of $1 billion.

== Member cities ==
In addition to the cities that voted to join DART at its creation, any city that adjoins a DART member city is eligible to join.

Member cities fund DART with a 1% sales tax earmarked to the Dallas Metropolitan Transit Authority (the legal name of the DART&#x27;s tax district). Texas law limits municipal sales taxes to 2% total, which prevents many cities from joining without sacrificing local sales taxes.

DART is capable of establishing service to locations in non-member cities through special agreements. For example, DART serves Eastfield College, which is within the city limits of non-DART member Mesquite, as it is a part of the Dallas College system.

=== List of DART member cities ===
All current members of DART are charter members, having joined during the 1983 vote.
=== Former DART member cities ===
=== Original cities that declined DART ===
These cities were part of the 1983 membership election and declined to join DART. Unless otherwise noted, these cities are still eligible to join DART.
=== Eligible cities that are not members of DART ===
These cities are eligible to join DART as they are adjacent to either Dallas or another DART member city, but they have not joined. With the exception of Parker, this is because they are unable to levy the 1% sales tax required for membership without cutting existing taxes.

<text>The Skoptsy (; &quot;eunuch&quot;) were a cult within the larger Spiritual Christianity movement in the Russian Empire. They were best known for practising emasculation of men, the mastectomy and female genital mutilation of women in accordance with their teachings against sexual lust. The descriptive term &quot;Skoptsy&quot; was coined by the Russian Orthodox Church.
The sect emerged in the late 18th century. It reached the peak of its popularity in the early 20th century but was essentially wiped out by the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.

==Beliefs and practices==
Skoptsy is a plural of &quot;skopets&quot;, at the time the Russian term for &quot;castrate&quot; (in contemporary Russian, the term has become restricted to referring to the sect, in its generic meaning replaced by the loanwords &quot;yévnukh&quot; е́внух, i.e. eunuch, and &quot;kastrat&quot; кастрат).

The Skoptsy referred to themselves as the &quot;White Doves&quot; (). Their aim was to perfect the individual by eradicating original sin, which they believed had come into the world by the first coitus between Adam and Eve. They believed that human genitals were the true mark of Cain, and that the true message of Jesus Christ included the practice of castration, that Jesus himself had been a castrate, and that his example had been followed by the apostles and the early Christian saints.

They believed that human genitals were a mark of original sin, and that after the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had the halves of the forbidden fruit grafted onto their bodies, forming testicles and breasts. Thus, the removal of these sexual organs restored the Skoptsy to the pristine state before the original sin. The Skoptsy maintained that they were fulfilling Christ&#x27;s counsel of perfection in Matthew 19:12 and 18:8–9.

There were two kinds of castration: the &quot;lesser seal&quot; and the &quot;greater seal&quot;. For men, the &quot;lesser seal&quot; meant the removal of the testicles only, while the &quot;greater seal&quot; involved either removal of the penis or emasculation (removal of both penis and testicles). Men who underwent the &quot;greater seal&quot; used a cow-horn when urinating. The castrations and emasculations were originally performed with a red-hot iron, called the &#x27;fiery baptism&#x27;. However, the skoptsy later transitioned to using knives or razors, with the iron serving only to stop the bloodflow. They also twisted the scrotum, destroying the seminal vesicles and stopping the flow of semen.

In women, the Skoptsy removed the nipples or the whole breasts. Occasionally, they simply scarred the breasts. They also often removed the labia minora and clitoris. They did not use anesthetics.

The operations were generally performed by elders. During the operation, they said the phrase &quot;Christ is risen!&quot;

According to ecclesiastical historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, the belief originated in a mistranslation by its founder Kondraty Selivanov of a biblical command in Genesis 1:28 as плотитесь (“castrate yourselves”) rather than плодитесь (“be fruitful”).

==History==

The Skoptsy movement emerged in the 1760s from the flagellant sect of the Khlysty. Its founder was a runaway peasant, later known as Kondratiy Ivanovich Selivanov, a former adherent of a Khlysty sect of Akulina Ivanovna in the Oryol Governorate. Selivanov had started his own sect in the village of Sosnovka near Morshansk, styling himself &quot;Son of God&quot; and &quot;Redeemer&quot;:
The community of Selivanov&#x27;s followers, totalling 246, were put on trial in 1772. Selivanov was convicted of having persuaded thirteen peasants to castrate themselves. He initially escaped, but was apprehended in 1775 and exiled to Nerchinsk, Siberia.

His followers organized to locate and free him. He was found living in Irkutsk, and managed to escape and move to Moscow in 1795. In 1797, he moved to Saint Petersburg where, according to Skoptsy accounts, he was interviewed by Tsar Paul I. He claimed to be the Tsar&#x27;s father, Peter III (who had been assassinated in 1762), following which Paul I had him confined to the madhouse at Obukhov hospital.

He was released in 1802. For the next eighteen years, until 1820, he lived in Saint Petersburg, in the house of one of his disciples. He received double homage as Christ and tsar, identifying himself as both Tsar Peter III and as Christ Returned. Peter had been popular among the Raskolniks (dissidents) because he granted them liberty of conscience, and among the peasants because when pillaging the convents he divided their lands among the labourers. Selivanov claimed the title &quot;God of Gods and King of Kings&quot;, and proclaimed salvation of believers through castration.

Selivanov succeeded in gaining followers even among the upper classes of Saint Petersburg.
When the Governor General of Saint Petersburg, Mikhail Miloradovich, learned that two of his nephews, as well as several members of the guards regiments and sailors, were members of the sect, he asked the imperial government to intervene. Eventually, in June 1820, it was decided to arrest Selivanov again and confine him to Spaso-Evfimiev monastery (Monastery of Saint Euthymius) in Suzdal, where he remained until his death in 1832, allegedly his hundredth year. During his stay in Suzdal, his followers continued to plead for his release. Although this was denied, Selivanov was free to receive visitors in the monastery, and his followers worshipped him there. He also left writings, known under the title &quot;The Message&quot; (Послание) and &quot;Harvest&quot; (Страды), as well as nine letters addressed to the priest Sergeyev.

Despite the furious investigations of the Third Department (the tsar&#x27;s secret police),
Skoptisism did not disappear after Selivanov&#x27;s death, and scandals continued to arise. The sect established a presence in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Morshansk and Odessa, and later in Bukarest and Iași in Romania, where members of the sect had fled due to the persecution by Russian authorities. By 1866, the sect was reported as having 5,444 members (3,979 men and 1,465 women). Although Skoptisism prescribed castration as a precondition for entering paradise, only a minority of members (703 men and 100 women) had undergone bodily mutilation. Alexandre Dumas, père, writes about the sect, calling them &quot;scopsis&quot;, towards the end of his account of his journey through Caucasia, &quot;Le Caucase, Memoires d&#x27;un Voyage&quot;, 1858, where he met them in Georgia. In the book &quot;The Idiot&quot;, Fyodor Dostoevsky mentions that the home of Parfyon Semyonovich Rogozhin is rented to Skoptsy tenants. Dostoevsky also mentions Skoptsy in the 1872 novel &quot;Demons&quot; and the 1880 novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;.

Repressive measures were tried along with ridicule: male Skoptsy were dressed in women&#x27;s clothes and paraded wearing fools&#x27; caps through the villages. In 1876, 130 Skoptsy were deported. To escape prosecution some of the sect emigrated, mostly to Romania, where some of them mixed with old-believer exiles known as Lipovans. Romanian writer I.L. Caragiale acknowledges that toward the end of the 19th century all the horse-powered cabs in Bucharest were driven by Russian Skoptsy (&quot;Scopiți&quot; in Romanian). Though the law was strict in Russia—every eunuch was compelled to register—Skoptsism did not abate in its popularity.
The Skoptsy became known as moneylenders, and a bench known as the &quot;Skoptsy&#x27;s Bench&quot; stood in Saint Petersburg for many years.

The Skoptsy may have had as many as 100,000 followers in the early 20th century, although repression continued and members of the sect were put on trial. Increased repression and collectivization under the Soviet Union reduced the numbers to a reported few thousand in 1929, when the authorities staged a widely publicized mass trial against the sect.

Leon Trotsky, in a report from Romania in 1913, wrote about the Skoptsy in the Dobruja region who worked as horse-cab drivers and played a predominant role in the local horse trade. Patrick Leigh Fermor in &quot;The Broken Road&quot; describes his encounters (in 1933/4) with two &quot;Skapetz&quot; (sic) in a Bucharest tavern and as a passenger in their horse-drawn cabs:
&quot;They conversed in oddly high-pitched voices in a language that sounded at first like Bulgarian but soon turned out to be—judging by its shifting vowels and liquid sounds—Russian.&quot;

Olivia Manning in &quot;The Great Fortune&quot; (1960) describes the Skoptsy carriage drivers of Bucharest based on her visit in 1939.

According to the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia,&quot; the sect still operated within the USSR in 1947. It is believed to have mostly disappeared by the 1970s, although there are controversial reports of surviving communities in Latvia in the 1990s.

<text>Corps (or Korps; &quot;das ~&quot; (&quot;n&quot;), (&quot;sg.&quot;), (&quot;pl.&quot;)) are the oldest still-existing kind of &quot;Studentenverbindung&quot;, Germany&#x27;s traditional university corporations; their roots date back to the 15th century. The oldest corps still existing today was founded in 1789. Its members are referred to as corps students (&quot;Corpsstudenten&quot;). The corps belong to the tradition of student fraternities which wear couleur and practice academic fencing.

Most corps are organized in two federations, the &quot;Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband&quot; (&quot;KSCV&quot;) and the &quot;Weinheimer Senioren-Convent&quot; (&quot;WSC&quot;). Together, they comprise 162 Corps throughout Germany, Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Switzerland and Lithuania.

The German Student Corps were traditionally recruited from the nobility, royalty, and social elite, and are traditionally viewed as more aristocratic and elitist than other German student fraternities such as the Catholic Cartellverband and the Burschenschaften. They consider and individuality to be key tenets and are rooted in German idealism. By and large, they are generally conservative in political outlook, but less right-wing and less nationalist than the Burschenschaften. The corps are open to students of all nationalities and religions, unlike many other student fraternities. Although distinct, the corps are in some aspects similar to and serve many of the same purposes as college fraternities found in the United States.

==Characterization==
Corps are built upon the principle of tolerance: No corps may endorse a certain political, scientific, or religious viewpoint. In addition, all members are solely chosen by their personal character. Neither national, ethnic, nor social provenance play a role.

&quot;Corpsstudenten&quot; (corps students) wear &quot;couleur&quot; (colored stripes and caps) and practice &quot;Mensuren&quot;, academic fencing with razor-sharp blades that can result in bleeding face wounds, &quot;Schmisse&quot;. The corps usually bear names that reflect their former origin from certain German regions, such as &quot;Saxonia&quot; (Saxony) or &quot;Guestphalia&quot; (Westphalia). Formerly, when a distance of a few hundred kilometres between a student&#x27;s home town and his university meant weeks of travel, students from the same part of Germany traveled together and formed some kind of &quot;new family&quot;. The distance, plus the fact that they carried the money for a complete semester with them in a bag, might also explain why students began fencing, simply for self-defense, for students, military officers, and aristocrats were the only people allowed to carry arms.

Like all &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot;, corps consist of two bodies: The active part consists of all members, that still study and have duties for the fraternity, and the so-called &quot;Altherrenschaft&quot; (alumni organization), comprising all those who graduated and thus provide the bear share of the monetary stimulus for the fraternity. A fundamental idea is that older students should help their younger fellows, and this principle dominates the relationship between the two bodies. The former keeps the everyday business of the corps alive, organizes gatherings, and keeps the &quot;Corpshaus&quot; (Corps House) in order. The &quot;Altherrenschaft&quot;, graduates with regular incomes, provide financial support. This usually means quite cheap housing for the younger members among other things. The &quot;Altherrenschaft&quot; has the power to intervene in the business of the active members, typically to ensure the principles and spirit of their corps.

The active body is headed by a panel of three &quot;Chargierte&quot; (charged persons), who are elected by all active, full members at the beginning of each semester (or at the end of the former one). Their functions are called &quot;Senior&quot;, &quot;Consenior&quot; and &quot;Drittchargierter&quot; (meaning &quot;third charged person&quot;, also named &quot;Subsenior&quot; in some corps).:
*The &quot;Senior&quot; is responsible for all corps affairs in general, but leading and heading gatherings and events in special; he supplements his signature with a single cross (x) (in some corps with three crosses (xxx)) as an external sign of his duties.
*The &quot;Consenior&quot; teaches fencing to all members of the inner corps and assures the execution of the Mensuren in coordination with the Conseniors of other corps; his signature is enhanced by two crosses (xx).
*The &quot;Drittchargierter&quot; (also known as &quot;Sekretär&quot;, Secretary) has administrative tasks like paperwork and often the task of a treasurer; his sign is three crosses (xxx) (in some corps one cross (x)).

Being the oldest of their kind, the corps tend to treat all other forms of German Studentenverbindungen with contempt; corps despise all posturing and affectation (e.g. the overly use of Latinisms) that other kinds of &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot;, esp. Catholic corporations and Burschenschaften show.

Even with the principle of tolerance being a central aspect in each corps&#x27; self-image, every corps student is urged to develop his own viewpoints, to stand for them and to strongly participate in society, whether in politics, economy, or social affairs. This encouragement for ethics and self-confidence on one hand, and the absence of a limitation to certain views on the other, let Corps students often show up as the leading figures of the most diverse political directions. The emphasis on individuality brought many corps students in opposition to totalitarian regimes, such as the National Socialist dictatorship.

The Weinheimer Student Corps also maintain a confederation with Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, a college Fraternity with over 270 chapters in the United States and Canada.

==History==
The Corps sprang from the older &quot;Landsmannschaft&quot;. The name Corps came into use in 1810 at the University of Heidelberg and soon displaced the older name of &quot;Landsmannschaft&quot; at all the universities. The oldest still active Corps are the 1789 founded Guestphalia at the University of Halle, the 1798 founded Onoldia at the University of Erlangen who are both members of the KSCV and as a member of the WSC the Saxo-Montania founded also 1798 at the Bergakademie Freiberg today at the RWTH Aachen University. After the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, the Corps were exposed to harsh persecution by university and state officials just like their rivals as at the universities in Germany the Burschenschaften. After 1848, they were officially approved.

<text>In algebra, the absorption law or absorption identity is an identity linking a pair of binary operations.

Two binary operations, ¤ and ⁂, are said to be connected by the absorption law if:

:&quot;a&quot; ¤ (&quot;a&quot; ⁂ &quot;b&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; ⁂ (&quot;a&quot; ¤ &quot;b&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;.

A set equipped with two commutative and associative binary operations formula_1 (&quot;join&quot;) and formula_2 (&quot;meet&quot;) that are connected by the absorption law is called a lattice; in this case, both operations are necessarily idempotent (i.e. &quot;a&quot; formula_1 &quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; formula_2 &quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;).

Examples of lattices include Heyting algebras and Boolean algebras, in particular sets of sets with &quot;union&quot; (∪) and &quot;intersection&quot; (∩) operators, and ordered sets with &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot; operations.

In classical logic, and in particular Boolean algebra, the operations OR and AND, which are also denoted by formula_1 and formula_2, satisfy the lattice axioms, including the absorption law. The same is true for intuitionistic logic.

The absorption law does not hold in many other algebraic structures, such as commutative rings, &quot;e.g.&quot; the field of real numbers, relevance logics, linear logics, and substructural logics. In the last case, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the free variables of the defining pair of identities.

<doc id="286175" wikidata="Q2934520" url="?curid=286175" title="Calvary Cemetery (Queens)">
<text>Calvary Cemetery is a Catholic cemetery in Maspeth and Woodside, Queens, in New York City, New York, United States. With about three million burials, it has the largest number of interments of any cemetery in the United States. Established in 1848, Calvary Cemetery covers and is owned by the Archdiocese of New York and managed by the Trustees of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

Calvary Cemetery is divided into four sections, spread across the neighborhoods of Maspeth and Woodside. The oldest, First Calvary, is also called &quot;Old Calvary&quot;. The Second, Third and Fourth sections are all considered part of &quot;New Calvary&quot;.

==History==

In 1817, the Trustees of Old St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on Mott Street, Manhattan, realized that their original cemetery on Mulberry Street was almost full. In 1847, faced with cholera epidemics and a shortage of burial grounds in Manhattan, the New York State Legislature passed the Rural Cemetery Act authorizing nonprofit corporations to operate commercial cemeteries. On October 29, 1845 Old St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral trustees had purchased of land from John McMenoy and John McNolte in Maspeth and this land was used to develop Calvary Cemetery. The cemetery was named after Mount Calvary, where Jesus Christ was crucified according to the New Testament.

The first Calvary Cemetery burial occurred on July 31, 1848. The name of the deceased was Esther Ennis, who reportedly &quot;died of a broken heart.&quot; The cemetery was consecrated by Archbishop John Hughes in August 1848. By 1852 there were 50 burials a day, half of them poor Irish under seven years of age. In the early 20th century, influenza and tuberculosis epidemics caused a shortage of gravediggers, and people dug graves for their own loved ones. The entire number of interments from the cemetery&#x27;s opening in August 1848 until January 1898, was 644,761. From January 1898 until 1907 there were about 200,000 interments, thus yielding roughly 850,000 interments at Calvary Cemetery by 1907.
Calvary was accessible by ferryboats crossing the East River from 23rd Street in Manhattan. It cost an adult seven dollars to be buried there. Burial of children under age seven cost three dollars; children aged seven to fourteen cost five dollars. As development in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village expanded, bodies buried in that neighborhood were transferred to Queens. In 1854, ferry service opened by 10th Street and the East River.

The original division of the cemetery, now known as First Calvary or Old Calvary, was filled by 1867. The Archdiocese of New York expanded the area of the cemetery, adding more sections, and by the 1990s there were nearly 3 million burials in Calvary Cemetery. The Cemetery continues to add plots and burial spaces can be purchased in advance.

In 1949, several hundred workers at the cemetery went on strike.

== Description ==
Calvary is split into four sections. The first section is known as First Calvary or Old Calvary, and is located to the west of the section of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway (I-278) that runs between the Long Island Expressway (I-495) interchange and Newtown Creek. The others are known collectively as New Calvary, and as a group to the east of the above-mentioned section of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway.

# First Calvary Cemetery is bounded by the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, Review Ave and 37th Street.
# Second Calvary Cemetery is in-between the Long Island and Brooklyn–Queens Expressways, and also bounded by 48th Street and 58th Street. The cemetery&#x27;s offices are located here, at 49–02 Laurel Hill Boulevard.
# Third Calvary Cemetery is north of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, and also bounded by Queens Boulevard, 49th Street and 58th Street.
# Fourth Calvary Cemetery is south of the Long Island Expressway, and also bounded by 55th Avenue, 50th Street and 58th Street.

The cemetery&#x27;s chapel is named for St. Callixtus and was designed by Raymond F. Almirall. Originally a frame structure, it was rebuilt using limestone in 1908.

==Calvary Veterans Park==
The Old Calvary section of the cemetery is a city-owned public park that serves as a burial ground, the Calvary Veterans Park.

===Calvary Monument===

The Calvary Monument, erected in 1866, originally with bronze sculptures is located in the park. It is by Daniel Draddy, one of the Draddy Brothers, who sculpted the obelisk to William James MacNeven. There is no signage from either entrance, nor any mention on the official web site&#x27;s maps. It is located at . The monument was last renovated in 1929. A conservation effort was initiated in 2009, but is not done.

The monument honors the 69th Regiment.

<text>The Kodava () (&quot;Koḍava takkï&quot;, , meaning &#x27;speech of Kodavas&#x27;, in the Kodava language, alternate name: Codava, [[Coorgi]], Kodagu) is a Dravidian language spoken in Kodagu district (Coorg) in Southern Karnataka, India. 
It is an endangered language. The term Kodava has two related usages. Firstly, it is the name of the Kodava language and culture followed by a number of communities from Kodagu. Secondly, within the Kodava-speaking communities and region (Kodagu), it is a demonym for the dominant Kodava people. Hence, the Kodava language is not only the primary language of the Kodavas but also of many other castes and tribes in Kodagu. The language has two dialects: Mendele (spoken in Northern and Central Kodagu, i.e. outside Kodagu&#x27;s Kiggat naadu) and Kiggat (spoken in Kiggat naadu, in Southern Kodagu).

Historically, it has been referred to as a dialect of Sentamizh (Pure Tamil), in some Tamil texts the Kodagu language is referred to as Kudakan Tamil. However, it has been re-analysed as a language by early 20th century academics. Now it is considered as an intermediate language between Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Tulu in comparative linguistics.

It is traditionally written using the thirke script which is an abugida. The 2011 Census of India reports 96,918 persons who returned Kodava as their mother tongue and 16,939 who returned Coorgi/Kodagu, for a total of 113,857 persons coming under the parent group which is again identified as Coorgi/Kodagu (another name for Kodava) as the mother tongue.

== History ==

In Kannada, the region was called Kodagu and the people Kodaga. Natively, the people were called Kodava and the land was called Kodavu in the folksongs. Comparative Dravidian studies show that the Kodava language belongs to the South Dravidian language group.

== Grammar ==
The grammar of Kodagu has been systematically studied and documented since at least around 1867 when Captain R.A. Cole published the seminal work &quot;An Elementary Grammar of the Coorg Language&quot;.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
Dravidian vowel systems contain five vowel qualities i.e. those usually corresponding to &quot;a, e, i, o&quot; and &quot;u.,&quot; with a short and long variants for each. However, Kodava has two more: the mid and high (close) back unrounded vowels, with corresponding long variants.

=== Consonants ===

Kodava and Kannada share a lack of palatalization of word-initial &quot;*k-&quot;, which is a feature found in the Tamil-Malayalam branch.

==Writing system ==

The Kodava (Kodagu) language was popularly written in the Kannada script. Dr. IM Muthanna, developed a script to Kodava Thakk in 1971, and as of 2022, Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy, a government body for the development of Kodava Language, accepted the script developed by Dr IM Muthanna as the official script of Kodava Language. It is also widely used across Kodagu, Although around 7 scripts were developed over a period from 1889 to 2008, Only Dr. IM Muthanna&#x27;s script is considered as the most acceptable script for Kodava Language. 

The Coorgi is an alphabet developed by the linguist Gregg M. Cox that is used by a number of individuals within Kodagu district of India to write the endangered Dravidian language of Kodava, also known sometimes as &quot;Coorgi&quot;.

The script uses a combination of 26 consonant letters, eight vowel letters and a diphthong marker. Each letter represents a single sound and there are no capital letters. A computer-based font has been created.
The script was developed out of the request by a group of Kodava individuals to have a distinct script for Kodava Takk, to distinguish the language. Kodava Takk is generally written in the Kannada script, but can also be found written in the Malayalam script, especially along the borders with Kerala. The new script is intended as a unified writing system for all Kodava Takk speakers.

Recently an old Kodava script from the 14th century was discovered, it is now called the Thirke script.

Various other scripts were made by Kodava writers like Iychettira M Muthanna, Koravanda Appayya, Appaneravanda Kiran Subbaiah.

==Comparisons==
Linguistically, Kodava/Kodagu language belongs to the South Dravidian subfamily of the Dravidian family. Further within the South Dravidian subfamily, it belongs to the subgroup Tamil-Malayalam-Kodagu-Kota-Toda. It is closely related to and influenced by Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Tulu. A majority of the words are common between Kodava and Beary bashe, a dialect which is a mixture of Tulu and Malayalam spoken by the Beary Muslims and Kodava Thiyyar communities. Kodava is also closely related to the Kasaragod and Kannur dialects of Malayalam, which are in turn related to Beary.

==Literature==

Family histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves called Pattole (patt=palm, ole=leaf) by astrologers in the ancient times. When Kodava was written, it was usually with Kannada script, sometimes with minor modifications. The folk songs of the Kodavas, called the Palame (also known as the Balo Patt or Dudi Patt), were orally transmitted across several generations. The language had no significant written literature until the twentieth century. Appachcha Kavi, a playwright, and Nadikerianda Chinnappa, a folk compiler, are the two important poets and writers of the Kodava language. Other important writers in the language were B D Ganapathy and I M Muthanna. In 2005, after requests from the Kodagu community, German linguist Gerard Cox created a script unique to Kodava called the Coorgi-Cox script. It uses straight lines for 5 vowels, and has circles for diphthongs.

The Pattole Palame, a collection of Kodava folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. The most important Kodava literature, it is said to be one of the earliest, if not the earliest, collection of folklore of a community in an Indian language. Nearly two-thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations, sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies and during festivals relating to the seasons and in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as Balo Pat, these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (drums) as they sing. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs. The Pattole Palame was written using the Kannada script originally; it has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa, grandchildren of Nadikerianda Chinnappa, and has been published by Rupa &amp; Co., New Delhi.

==Cinema==
The Kodava Cinema industry is very small. A few movies portraying the native culture and traditions of the Kodavas have been produced in this language. The first Kodava film &#x27;Nada Mann Nada Kool&#x27; was directed by S.R.Rajan and produced in the year 1972.

==Recent developments==
Since 2021, the Mangalore University teaches an MA degree in the Kodava language.

<doc id="286189" wikidata="Q981309" url="?curid=286189" title="José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa">
<text>José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, 1st Marquess of Concordia, KOS (), (sometimes spelled &quot;Souza&quot;) (June 3, 1743 in Oviedo, Asturias, Spain – June 30, 1821 in Madrid) was a Spanish military officer and colonial administrator in America. From August 20, 1806, to July 7, 1816, he was viceroy of Peru, during the Spanish American wars of independence.

==Background==
Abascal was born into a noble family. At the age of 19 he entered the army. After serving for 20 years he was promoted to colonel, and later in the war against France, to brigadier. In 1796 he took part in the defense of Havana against the British. Three years later he was named commanding general and intendant of Nueva Galicia (western Mexico). He took up that office in 1800. In 1804 he was named viceroy of Río de la Plata in Buenos Aires. He never took possession of the office, because in the same year (1804) he was named viceroy of Peru.

==As viceroy of Peru==
He was unable to occupy the position of viceroy in Lima until 1806, because he was taken prisoner by the British during his voyage from Spain. Once in office, Abascal promoted educational reforms, reorganized the army, and stamped out local rebellions. The last cargo of black slaves in Peru was landed during his administration, in 1806. At that time an adult male slave sold for 600 pesos.

The Balmis Expedition arrived in Lima on May 23, 1806. This expedition, named for its head, Doctor Francisco Javier de Balmis, was propagating smallpox vaccine throughout the Spanish Empire. Balmis himself was not with the group that arrived in Peru. The Peruvian group was headed by Doctor José Salvany, Balmis&#x27;s deputy. The vaccine had proceeded them, however, having arrived in Lima from Buenos Aires. On August 2, 1805, 22 Brazilian slaves had been vaccinated there and sent as living carriers of the vaccine to northern Argentina, Paraguay, Chile and Peru. (The Balmis expedition used Spanish orphans for the same purpose.) Abascal ordered mass vaccinations in Lima, but without much success. The vaccine was available, but it was not free, and vested interests were able to preserve it as a source of revenue.

On December 1, 1806, an earthquake lasting 2 minutes shook the towers of the city of Lima. Earthquake-generated waves at El Callao threw a heavy anchor onto the roof of the harbormaster. One hundred fifty thousand pesos were required to repair the walls of the city. In October 1807 a comet was seen in Lima, and in November 1811 another one appeared that was visible with the naked eye for six months.

In 1810 the medical school of San Fernando was founded. In 1812 and 1813 occurred the great fire of Guayaquil that destroyed half the city, a hurricane in Lima that uprooted trees in the Alameda, and earthquakes in Ica and Piura.

==The wars of independence==
When revolution broke out in Buenos Aires on May 25, 1810, Abascal reoccupied the provinces of Córdoba, Potosí, La Paz and Charcas (in Upper Peru, now Bolivia) and reincorporated them into the Viceroyalty of Peru. (These provinces had been separated from Peru when the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata was created in 1776.) A royalist army defeated rebels in the Battle of Huaqui, Upper Peru.

He also reincorporated Chile and Quito (Ecuador) into the Viceroyalty of Peru. (Quito had been in the Viceroyalty of New Granada since the separation of that colony from Peru in 1739.)

Abascal was a dedicated and tireless supporter of absolute monarchy; nevertheless he supported the Cortes of Cádiz in the fight with Napoleon, sending money and materiel. During his administration, the Inquisition of Lima was temporarily abolished as a result of the reforms taken by the Cortes. Because of the distance between Peru and Spain and due to the wars in Spain and in the Americas, he governed nearly independently of mother country. He fought hard to suppress the independence movements in Spanish America, converting Peru into a center of royalist reaction. After the proclamation of the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 in Spain, Abascal fought to keep its provisions from being applied in Peru. This led to revolts in Cusco, Tacna and Arequipa, all of which were repressed.

In 1812 Abascal gave his support to a plan for a company organised by Francisco Uville to import steam engines made by the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick so the silver mines at Cerro de Pasco could be pumped out and worked at much greater depths.

On April 24, 1814, a Spanish force under Rafael Maroto disembarked at Callao to fight the rebels in the colony. The viceroy sent 2,400 troops under Brigadier Antonio Pareja to fight in Chile. When they arrived on the island of Chiloé, they were joined by a large number of other men, and they also gained reinforcements in the cities of Valdivia and Talcahuano. This southern part of the country was not sympathetic to the independence movement. Parejas then entered Concepción. He granted amnesty to the Spanish garrison there, and they joined his forces. Now leading about 4,000 troops he went to Chillán, which surrendered without a fight. There 2,000 more men joined the royalist forces.

In 1812 Abascal was created marqués de la Concordia. In 1816 he was recalled at his request, and returned to Spain. He was replaced by General Joaquín de la Pezuela. Abascal died at the age of 79 in 1821.

<text>Torticollis, also known as wry neck, is a painful, dystonic condition defined by an abnormal, asymmetrical head or neck position, which may be due to a variety of causes. The term &quot;torticollis&quot; is derived .

The most common case has no obvious cause, and the pain and difficulty in turning the head usually goes away after a few days, even without treatment in adults.

==Signs and symptoms==
Torticollis is a fixed or dynamic tilt, rotation, with flexion or extension of the head and/or neck.

The type of torticollis can be described depending on the positions of the head and neck.
* laterocollis: the head is tipped toward the shoulder
* rotational torticollis: the head rotates along the longitudinal axis towards the shoulder
* anterocollis: forward flexion of the head and neck and brings the chin towards the chest
* retrocollis: hyperextension of head and neck backward bringing the back of the head towards the back
A combination of these movements may often be observed. Torticollis can be a disorder in itself as well as a symptom in other conditions.

Other signs and symptoms include:
* Neck pain
* Occasional formation of a mass
* Thickened or tight sternocleidomastoid muscle
* Tenderness on the cervical spine
* Tremor in head
* Unequal shoulder heights
* Decreased neck movement

==Causes==
A multitude of conditions may lead to the development of torticollis including: muscular fibrosis, congenital spine abnormalities, or toxic or traumatic brain injury.
A rough categorization discerns between congenital torticollis and acquired torticollis.

Other categories include:
* Osseous
* Traumatic
* CNS/PNS
* Ocular
* Non-muscular soft tissue
* Spasmodic
* Drug induced
* Oral ties (lip and tongue ties)

===Congenital muscular torticollis===
Congenital muscular torticollis is the most common torticollis that is present at birth. Congenital muscular torticollis is the third most common congenital musculoskeletal deformity in children. The cause of congenital muscular torticollis is unclear. Birth trauma or intrauterine malposition is considered to be the cause of damage to the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck. Other alterations to the muscle tissue arise from repetitive microtrauma within the womb or a sudden change in the calcium concentration in the body that causes a prolonged period of muscle contraction.

Any of these mechanisms can result in a shortening or excessive contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which curtails its range of motion in both rotation and lateral bending. The head is typically tilted in lateral bending toward the affected muscle and rotated toward the opposite side. In other words, the head itself is tilted in the direction of the shortened muscle, with the chin tilted in the opposite direction.

Congenital torticollis is presented at 1–4 weeks of age, and a hard mass usually develops. It is normally diagnosed using ultrasonography and a color histogram or clinically by evaluating the infant&#x27;s passive cervical range of motion.

Congenital torticollis constitutes the majority of cases seen in paediatric clinical practice. The reported incidence of congenital torticollis is 0.3-2.0%. Sometimes a mass, such as a sternocleidomastoid tumor, is noted in the affected muscle. Congenital Muscular Torticollis is also defined by a fibrosis contracture of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on one side of the neck. Congenital torticollis may not resolve on its own, and can result in rare complications including plagiocephaly. Secondary complications associated with Congenital Muscular Torticollis include visual dysfunctions, facial asymmetry, delayed development, cervical scoliosis, and vertebral wedge degeneration which will have a serious impact on the child&#x27;s appearance and even mental health.

Benign paroxysmal torticollis is a rare disorder affecting infants. Recurrent attacks may last up to a week. The condition improves by age 2. The cause is thought to be genetic.

===Acquired torticollis===
Noncongenital muscular torticollis may result from muscle spasm, trauma, scarring or disease of cervical vertebrae, adenitis, tonsillitis, rheumatism, enlarged cervical glands, retropharyngeal abscess, or cerebellar tumors. It may be spasmodic (clonic) or permanent (tonic). The latter type may be due to Pott&#x27;s Disease (tuberculosis of the spine).
* A self-limiting spontaneously occurring form of torticollis with one or more painful neck muscles is by far the most common (&#x27;stiff neck&#x27;) and will pass spontaneously in 1–4 weeks. Usually the sternocleidomastoid muscle or the trapezius muscle is involved. Sometimes draughts, colds, or unusual postures are implicated; however, in many cases, no clear cause is found. These episodes are commonly seen by physicians.
Most commonly this self-limiting form relates to an untreated dental occlusal dysfunction, which is brought on by clenching and grinding the teeth during sleep. Once the occlusion is treated it will completely resolve. Treatment is accomplished with an occlusal appliance, and equilibration of the dentition.
* Tumors of the skull base (posterior fossa tumors) can compress the nerve supply to the neck and cause torticollis, and these problems must be treated surgically.
* Infections in the posterior pharynx can irritate the nerves supplying the neck muscles and cause torticollis, and these infections may be treated with antibiotics if they are not too severe, but could require surgical debridement in intractable cases.
* Ear infections and surgical removal of the adenoids can cause an entity known as Grisel&#x27;s syndrome, a subluxation of the upper cervical joints, mostly the atlantoaxial joint, due to inflammatory laxity of the ligaments caused by an infection.
* The use of certain drugs, such as antipsychotics, can cause torticollis.
* Antiemetics - Neuroleptic Class - Phenothiazines
* There are many other rare causes of torticollis. A very rare cause of acquired torticollis is fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), the hallmark of which is malformed great toes.

===Spasmodic torticollis===
 Torticollis with recurrent, but transient contraction of the muscles of the neck and especially of the sternocleidomastoid, is called spasmodic torticollis. Synonyms are &quot;intermittent torticollis&quot;, &quot;cervical dystonia&quot; or &quot;idiopathic cervical dystonia&quot;, depending on cause.

=== Trochlear torticollis ===

Torticollis can be caused by damage to the trochlear nerve (fourth cranial nerve), which supplies the superior oblique muscle of the eye. The superior oblique muscle is involved in depression, abduction, and intorsion of the eye. When the trochlear nerve is damaged, the eye is extorted because the superior oblique is not functioning. The affected person will have vision problems unless they turn their head away from the side that is affected, causing intorsion of the eye and balancing out the extorsion of the eye. This can be diagnosed by the Bielschowsky test, also called the head-tilt test, where the head is turned to the affected side. A positive test occurs when the affected eye elevates, seeming to float up.

== Anatomy ==
The main job of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is to help move the head and neck by turning the head to one side and bending the neck forward. The sternocleidomastoid muscle gets its blood from different arteries in the neck, which bring oxygen and nutrients to keep the muscle healthy. Torticollis can happen when there are issues with the sternocleidomastoid muscle, like if it&#x27;s too short, causing the head and neck to be in an odd position. Torticollis can also be caused by problems with bones, muscles, or the spine in the neck, leading to difficulty moving the head and neck normally. Knowing about the sternocleidomastoid muscle and how it works is crucial for doctors to diagnose and treat torticollis correctly, so they can find and fix the problem causing it. Differences in how the sternocleidomastoid muscle is supplied with blood or nerves can affect how torticollis develops or how well treatments work, so it&#x27;s important for doctors to consider these variations when planning treatment. Having a good understanding of the neck&#x27;s anatomy helps doctors accurately diagnose torticollis and choose the best treatments to help patients feel better.

The sternocleidomastoid muscle gets signals from nerves in the neck and head to contract and move properly. The underlying anatomical distortion causing torticollis is a shortened sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is the muscle of the neck that originates at the sternum and clavicle and inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone on the same side. There are two sternocleidomastoid muscles in the human body and when they both contract, the neck is flexed. The main blood supply for these muscles come from the occipital artery, superior thyroid artery, transverse scapular artery and transverse cervical artery. The main innervation to these muscles is from cranial nerve XI (the accessory nerve) but the second, third and fourth cervical nerves are also involved. Pathologies in these blood and nerve supplies can lead to torticollis.

==Diagnosis==

Evaluation of a child with torticollis begins with history taking to determine circumstances surrounding birth and any possibility of trauma or associated symptoms. Physical examination reveals decreased rotation and bending to the side opposite from the affected muscle. Some say that congenital cases more often involve the right side, but there is not complete agreement about this in published studies. Evaluation should include a thorough neurologic examination, and the possibility of associated conditions such as developmental dysplasia of the hip and clubfoot should be examined. Radiographs of the cervical spine should be obtained to rule out obvious bony abnormality, and MRI should be considered if there is concern about structural problems or other conditions.

Ultrasonography can be used to visualize muscle tissue, with a colour histogram generated to determine cross-sectional area and thickness of the muscle.

Evaluation by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist should be considered in children to ensure that the torticollis is not caused by vision problems (IV cranial nerve palsy, nystagmus-associated &quot;null position&quot;, etc.).

Differential diagnosis for torticollis includes
* Cranial nerve IV palsy
* Spasmus nutans
* Sandifer syndrome
* Myasthenia gravis
* Cerebrospinal fluid leak

Cervical dystonia appearing in adulthood has been believed to be idiopathic in nature, as specific imaging techniques most often find no specific cause.

== Treatment ==
Teaching people how to sit and stand properly can help reduce strain on the neck muscles and improve posture. Changing habits like bad posture or repetitive movements can help ease symptoms of torticollis. Wearing a special collar can also support the neck and keep it in the right position during daily activities. Using electrical devices have also been shown to reduce pain, make muscles work better, and relax tight muscles. Injecting a substance like Botox into overactive muscles can weaken them temporarily, allowing for better movement. If other treatments don&#x27;t work, surgery might be needed to fix the muscles or bones causing torticollis.

=== Physical therapy ===
Physical therapy is an option for treating torticollis in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner. Physical therapy is seen as an early conservative intervention to minimize the intensity of the musculoskeletal disorder, leading to short durations of care as well as improved outcomes from treatment. The Physical Therapy Management of Congenital Muscular Torticollis Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (CMT CPG) reflects the recommendations and guidelines for physical therapists in diagnosing, treating and educating families of infants with congenital muscular torticollis. Physical therapists that reported using the 2013 CMT CPG in their practices saw patient torticollis resolution in as little as 6-months increase from 42%-61%. As of currently, there is an updated 2024 CMT CMG from the American Physical Therapy Association. In the children above 1 year of age, surgical release of the tight sternocleidomastoid muscle is indicated along with aggressive therapy and appropriate splinting. Occupational therapy rehabilitation in congenital muscular torticollis concentrates on observation, orthosis, gentle stretching, myofascial release techniques, parents’ counseling-training, and home exercise program. While outpatient infant physiotherapy is effective, home therapy performed by a parent or guardian is just as effective in reversing the effects of congenital torticollis. It is important for physical therapists to educate parents on the importance of their role in the treatment and to create a home treatment plan together with them for the best results for their child. 

Five components have been recognized as the &quot;first choice intervention&quot; in PT for treatment of torticollis and include 

* neck passive range of motion, 
* neck and trunk active range of motion, 
* development of symmetrical movement, 
* environmental adaptations, and 
* caregiver education

In therapy, parents or guardians should expect their child to be provided with these important components, explained in detail below. Lateral neck flexion and overall range of motion can be regained quicker in newborns when parents conduct physical therapy exercises several times a day.

Physical therapists should teach parents and guardians to perform the following exercises:
* Stretching the neck and trunk muscles actively. Parents can help promote this stretching at home with infant positioning. For example, prone positioning will encourage the child to lift their chin off the ground, thereby strengthening their bilateral neck and spine extensor muscles, and stretching their neck flexor muscles. Active rotation exercises in supine, sitting or prone position by using toys, lights and sounds to attract infant&#x27;s attention to turn neck and look toward the non-affected side.
* Stretching the muscle in a prone position passively. Passive stretching is manual, and does not include infant involvement. Two people can be involved in these stretches, one person stabilizing the infant while the other holds the head and slowly brings it through the available range of motion. Passive stretching should not be painful to the child, and should be stopped if the child resists. Also, discontinue the stretch if changes in breathing or circulation are seen or felt.
* Stretching the muscle in a lateral position supported by a pillow (have infant lie on the side with the neck supported by pillow). Affected side should be against the pillow to deviate the neck towards the non-affected side.
* Environmental adaptations can control posture in strollers, car seats and swings (using U-shaped neck pillow or blankets to hold neck in neutral position)
* Passive cervical rotation (much like stretching when being supported by a pillow, have affected side down)
* Position infant in the crib with affected side by the wall so they must turn to the non-affected side to face out

Physical therapists often encourage parents and caregivers of children with torticollis to modify the environment to improve neck movements and position. Modifications may include:
* Adding neck supports to the car seat to attain optimal neck alignment
* Reducing time spent in a single position
* Using toys to encourage the child to look in the direction of limited neck movement
* Alternating sides when bottle or breastfeeding
* Encouraging prone playtime. Although the Back to Sleep campaign promotes infants sleeping on their backs to avoid sudden infant death syndrome during sleep, parents should still ensure that their infants spend some waking hours on their stomachs.
Environmental Modifications for Torticollis Management:

* Placing the baby in a crib with the affected side facing the wall can encourage them to turn their head the other way, promoting better movement.

=== Manual therapy ===
A meta-analysis shows physical therapists specializing in manual therapy have developed effective interventions for the management of Congenital Muscular Torticollis (CMT), primarily centered around massage and passive stretching techniques. These interventions are tailored to address the specific needs of pediatric patients, with a focus on stretching the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Various protocols have been proposed, including stretching exercises held for specific durations and repetitions, aimed at increasing blood flow, and promoting muscle relaxation.

Additionally, massage maneuvers such as rhythmic muscle mobilization techniques are employed to mobilize cervical structures and induce relaxation. The systematic review highlights the efficacy of manual therapy and passive stretching in improving cervical range of motion (ROM) in children with CMT. Furthermore, the involvement of caregivers in home exercise programs is emphasized as crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes and promoting motor development while preventing secondary complications.

A systematic review, looked into the possible benefits of using manipulation techniques to counteract infant torticollis. The study considered the impact of manipulation on an infant&#x27;s sleep, crying, and restlessness as well. This review did not report any adverse effects of using manipulation techniques. It was shown that using manipulation techniques on their own had little to no statistical differences from a placebo group, immediately. When manipulation techniques were combined with physical therapy, there was a change in symptoms compared to the use of physical therapy alone. When targeting the cervical spine, manipulation techniques were shown to shorten treatment duration in infants with head asymmetries.

=== Microcurrent therapy ===
A Korean study has recently introduced an additional treatment called microcurrent therapy that may be effective in treating congenital torticollis. For this therapy to be effective the children should be under three months of age and have torticollis involving the entire sternocleidomastoid muscle with a palpable mass and a muscle thickness over 10 mm. Microcurrent therapy sends minute electrical signals into tissue to restore the normal frequencies in cells. Microcurrent therapy is completely painless and children can only feel the probe from the machine on their skin.

Microcurrent therapy is thought to increase ATP and protein synthesis as well as enhance blood flow, reduce muscle spasms and decrease pain along with inflammation. It should be used in addition to regular stretching exercises and ultrasound diathermy. Ultrasound diathermy generates heat deep within body tissues to help with contractures, pain and muscle spasms as well as decrease inflammation. This combination of treatments shows remarkable outcomes in the duration of time children are kept in rehabilitation programs: Micocurrent therapy can cut the length of a rehabilitation program almost in half with a full recovery seen after 2.6 months.

About 5–10% of cases fail to respond to stretching and require surgical release of the muscle.

=== Surgery ===
Surgical release involves the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle being dissected free. This surgery can be minimally invasive and done laparoscopically. Usually surgery is performed on those who are over 12 months old. The surgery is for those who do not respond to physical therapy or botulinum toxin injection or have a very fibrotic sternocleidomastoid muscle. After surgery the child will be required to wear a soft neck collar (also called a Callot&#x27;s cast). There will be an intense physiotherapy program for 3–4 months as well as strengthening exercises for the neck muscles.

=== Other treatments ===

Other treatments include:
* Rest and analgesics for acute cases
* Diazepam or other muscle relaxants
* Botulinum toxin
* Encouraging active movements for children 6–8 months of age
* Ultrasound diathermy

=== Overview ===
CMT is a neck problem that babies are born with or develop soon after birth, causing their neck to be stiff and bent in an awkward position. Besides the sternocleidomastoid muscle, other muscles in the neck can also be affected by CMT, leading to problems moving the head and neck normally. The main goal of treating CMT is to make the sternocleidomastoid muscle stronger and more flexible, so the neck can move better and symptoms can improve.

== Prognosis ==
Studies and evidence from clinical practice show that 85–90% of cases of congenital torticollis are resolved with conservative treatment such as physical therapy. Earlier intervention is shown to be more effective and faster than later treatments. More than 98% of infants with torticollis treated before 1 month of age recover by 2.5 months of age. Infants between 1 and 6 months usually require about 6 months of treatment. After that point, therapy will take closer to 9 months, and it is less likely that the torticollis will be fully resolved. It is possible that torticollis will resolve spontaneously, but chance of relapse is possible. For this reason, infants should be reassessed by their physical therapist or other provider 3–12 months after their symptoms have resolved.

==Other animals==

In veterinary literature usually only the lateral bend of head and neck is termed torticollis, whereas the analogon to the rotatory torticollis in humans is called a head tilt. The most frequently encountered form of torticollis in domestic pets is the head tilt, but occasionally a lateral bend of the head and neck to one side is encountered.

===Head tilt===
Causes for a head tilt in domestic animals are either diseases of the central or peripheral vestibular system or relieving posture due to neck pain. Known causes for head tilt in domestic animals include:
* &quot;Encephalitozoon cuniculi&quot; infection in rabbits
* parasitic infestation by the nematode (roundworm) &quot;Baylisascaris procyonis&quot; in rabbits
* Inner ear infection
* Hypothyroidism in dogs
* Disease of cranial nerve VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve) through trauma, infection, inflammation, or neoplasia
* Disease of the brain stem caused by stroke, trauma, or neoplasia
* Damage to the vestibular organ due to toxicity, inflammation or impaired blood supply
* Geriatric vestibular syndrome in dogs

<text>Sir Maurice Abbot (1565–1642) was an English merchant, Governor of the East India Company (1624–1638), and a politician who sat in the House of Commons (1621 - 1626). He was Lord Mayor of London in 1638.

Abbot&#x27;s whole career, which had begun under no external advantages, was a remarkable instance of well-directed energy and enterprise; it was one of the earliest examples of the creation of enormous wealth by the application of great personal abilities to commerce, and illustrates the extraordinary development of the English foreign trade at the close of the sixteenth and opening of the seventeenth centuries.

==Biography==
Abbot was the fifth and youngest son of Maurice Abbot, a cloth-worker of Guildford who died in 1606, and he was the brother of George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury) and of Robert Abbot (Bishop of Salisbury). He was baptised at Holy Trinity Church, Guildford on 2 November 1565, was educated at Royal Grammar School, Guildford and was probably apprenticed in London to his father&#x27;s trade. Subsequently he became a freeman of the Drapers&#x27; Company, and rapidly amassed great wealth as a merchant dealing in various commodities such as cloth, indigo, spices and jewellery.

Abbot was one of the original directors of the East India Company, which was incorporated by royal charter in 1600, was among the earliest to invest large sums in its &quot;stock&quot;, was a member of its special committee of direction from 1607 onwards, and was throughout his life foremost in defending its interests against its enemies at home and abroad. In 1608 he was appointed a representative of the company for the audit of the accounts of expenses incurred jointly with the Muscovy Company in &quot;setting forth John Kingston for the discovery of the north-west passage&quot;.

He became a member of the committee of the Virginia Company in 1610, and its auditor from 1619 to 1620. In 1614, Abbot was one of the original Shareholders of the Somers Isles Company, which was formed by the shareholders of the Virginia Company to separately administer The Somers Isles (or Bermuda) (which the Virginia Company had been in de facto possession of since the 1612 wreck of the Sea Venture, and which its royal charter had been extended to include in 1612). &quot;Abbott&#x27;s Bay&quot; in Pembroke, Bermuda, was named after him (but was renamed &quot;Clarence Cove&quot; in 1822, when the surrounding Admiralty House property, &#x27;til then known as &quot;St. John&#x27;s Hill&quot;, was renamed &quot;Clarence Hill&quot; in commemoration of Admiral of the Fleet, Prince William, the Duke of Clarence (later King William IV)). Abbott&#x27;s Cliff in Hamilton Parish, Bermuda, may also be named for him.

Early in 1615 Abbot was one of the commissioners despatched to Holland to settle the disputes that were constantly arising between the Dutch East India Company and the East India Company as to their trading rights in the East Indies and their fishing rights in the north seas. But the conferences that followed, produced no satisfactory result. In May 1615 Abbot himself paid a visit to the East Indies, and on his return was chosen deputy-governor of the company, an annual office to which he was eight times in succession re-elected.

During subsequent years the disagreements with the Dutch increased in force, and in 1619 Abbot was one of those appointed to treat in London with commissioners from Holland as to the peaceful establishment of the two companies abroad. A treaty was signed (2 June), which secured two-thirds of the spice produce of the Molucca Islands, where the disputes had grown hottest, to the Dutch company, and the remaining third to the English. But this settlement was not a permanent one. In 1620 the Dutch infringed some regulations of the treaty, and Abbot in company with Sir Dudley Digges went on an embassy to Holland to set matters once again on a surer footing. The commissioners were at first well received (20 November 1620) by the Prince of Orange and the states-general; but the Dutch were unwilling to make any concessions, and pursued the negotiations, according to the English accounts, with too much duplicity to admit of any effectual arrangement.

In February 1621 Abbot returned to London, and in an audience granted him by James I he bitterly complained of the &quot;base usage&quot; to which he had been subjected. It was clearly impossible to diminish the active feelings of jealousy that existed between the English and Dutch residents in the East Indies, and Abbot shared the sentiment too heartily to enable him to improve the position of affairs. In 1624 matters became more critical. News reached England that Amboyna, one of the chief trading depots of the Moluccas, had been the scene of the murder of Gabriel Towerson and several other English traders by the Dutch. At the time Abbot was holding the office of governor of the company, to which he had been elected on 23 March 1624. Intense excitement prevailed throughout the country, and the greatest anxiety was evinced as to the steps that Abbot would take. He recognised at once the necessity of &quot;pressing the matter modestly&quot;, in order to avoid open war with Holland; but in repeated audiences with James I and in petitions and speeches to the privy council he insisted that demand should be made of the Dutch authorities to bring the perpetrators of the outrage to justice. He spoke of withdrawing from the trade altogether if this measure was not adopted, and after much delay the Dutch agreed to give the desired reparation. But death of James I saw the promise unfulfilled, and Abbot&#x27;s efforts to pursue the question further proved unavailing.

Abbot not only took a leading part in the affairs of the East India Company during these years, he was also an influential member of the Levant Company before 1607, and the English merchant service was, from the beginning of the seventeenth century, largely under his control. In 1614 one of his vessels, named the &quot;Tiger&quot;, was assaulted and taken by &quot;M. Mintaine, a Frenchman of the &quot;Mauritius&quot;&quot;, and Abbot sought redress for the injury in vain. In 1616 he with others received a bounty for building six new ships. In 1612 he was nominated a director of a newly incorporated company &quot;of merchants of London, discoverers of the north-west passage&quot;, and his statement that in 1614 he &quot;brought to the mint 60 pounds weight of gold for Indian commodities exported&quot; proves that his own commercial transactions continued for many years on a very large scale. He also expressed himself anxious a few years later to open up trade with Persia, and to wrest from the Portuguese East India Company the commercial predominance they had acquired there.

During the last twenty years of his life Abbot played a still more active part in public affairs. In 1621 he was elected Member of Parliament for Kingston-upon-Hull; shortly afterwards was nominated one of the commissioners for equipping merchant vessels to take part in a projected expedition against the pirates of Algiers, and he appears to have been consulted by the king&#x27;s ministers in every stage of the preparations, which were for a long period under discussion.

On 17 November 1621 Abbot became a customs farmer, and in 1623 he was empowered to administer &quot;oaths to such persons as should either desire to pass the seas from this kingdom or to enter it from abroad&quot;. A few months later he was engaged in personal negotiations with James I and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham for the remission of part of £20,000. claimed by them from the East India Company.

In 1624, when he was again returned to parliament for Kingston-upon-Hull, Abbot was appointed a member of the council for establishing the colony of Virginia. It was in the same year that he had been elected governor of the East India Company, an office that he was still holding in 1633, but which he resigned before 1638; and during the time that he sat in parliament he was continually called upon to speak in the company&#x27;s behalf. On many occasions he complained of the obloquy heaped upon himself and his friends, because it was supposed that their extensive foreign trade deprived this country of the benefit of their wealth, and, with a discrimination far in advance of his age, denounced the &quot;curiousness&quot; of the English in forbidding the exportation of specie, and asserted the economic advantages to the state of the company&#x27;s commerce.

On the accession of Charles I in 1625 Abbot was the first to receive the honour of knighthood from the new king, and he represented the City of London in the Useless Parliament (the earliest parliament of the reign), although his old constituency had tried hard to secure his services. He apparently supplied some of the jewellery required for Charles&#x27;s coronation, and received on 5 July of the same year &quot;£8,000 for a diamond cut in facets and set in a collet&quot;. On 15 December 1626 Abbot became Alderman of the ward of Bridge Without, and a few months later was chosen Sheriff of London.

In 1627 the customs department was reorganised, and Abbot with others received a lease of the customs on wines and currants for three and a half years, in consideration of a fine of £12,000 and a loan to the King of £20,000. But he was no servile agent of the crown. On 16 September 1628 information was sent to the king&#x27;s council that Abbot was one of the merchants who refused to pay a newly imposed additional tax on the importation of currants, and that, while the quarrel was pending, he had broken into the government warehouse where currants belonging to him had been stored. But the supreme authorities do not appear to have pressed the charge against him.

In 1637 he was one of those entrusted by the lords of the admiralty with fitting out ships at the expense of the city of London in accordance with the ship-money edict of 1636, and the attorney-general and the recorder of London shortly afterwards exhibited an information against him in the exchequer court on the ground that he had not provided sufficient men and ammunition. By order of the king&#x27;s council, however, the proceedings against Abbot were stayed, and the charge dropped. In 1642 the recorder of London, who took part in the matter in behalf of the crown, was impeached by the parliament for having advised Abbot and others to levy ship-money.

In 1638 Sir Maurice Abbot, who had on 13 September 1631 exchanged the ward of Bridge Without for that of Coleman Street, became Lord Mayor of London. The usual description of the pageant prepared to celebrate his introduction into office was from the pen of Thomas Heywood, the dramatist. Only one perfect copy of this rare work is now known, and it is in the Guildhall library. In a dedication to the new lord mayor, Heywood emphasises Abbot&#x27;s popularity among his fellow-citizens, and refers to the extraordinarily successful careers of himself and his two brothers. &quot;Neither can I omit the happinesse of your deceased father, remarkable in three most fortunate sonnes&quot;. In &quot;the first show&quot; described by Heywood he makes allusion to &quot;the trading of the right honourable the present lord mayor, who is a merchant free of the Turkey, Italian, French, Muscovy, and was late governour of the East-Indy Company&quot;. In another &quot;show&quot; a shepherd was introduced to typify the cloth trade, in which Abbot was still engaged, and subsequently an actor in the pageant, in the character of an Indian, addressed laudatory verses to the new lord mayor as the chief merchant of England, &quot;By whose commerce our nation hath been fam&#x27;d&quot;.

Abbot&#x27;s mayoralty, which covered the greater part of the year 1639, was rendered somewhat eventful by the outbreak of war with the Scots (the Bishops War), and by the departure of an English army for the northern border under the king himself. On 7 March Abbot was constituted &quot;the King&#x27;s lieutenant within the city and suburbs of London&quot; during his absence in the north. and was given full authority to arm, if necessary, the inhabitants against the King&#x27;s enemies, and at the discretion of himself and the aldermen to put in force martial law. In the following months he was frequently admonished by the king&#x27;s council to keep a strict watch over the manufacturers of shot and other warlike implements, and ordered to make arrests of suspected persons. At times his energy in this direction seems to have been excessive. On 28 May he sent to the Poultry Counter a woman suspected to have distributed during the Whitsuntide holidays a pamphlet by John Lilburne, the famous agitator; but the House of Lords in the following year reversed Abbot&#x27;s decision. He also regularly collected ship-money. On the termination of his year of office Abbot practically retired from public life. He died 10 January 1642, and was buried in St Stephen, Coleman Street, London.

There is no certain record of the situation of Abbot&#x27;s house in London, but his name occurs among those who in 1630 held &quot;tenements from the great south door (of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral) to the south-west corner of the cloister wall&quot;, and he was one of the commissioners nominated in 1631 for the repair of the cathedral.

In 1633 Robert Ashley dedicated his translation of an Italian work on Cochin China to Abbot, and attributes to him the assertion that &quot;the remotest traffique is always the most beneficiall to the publick stocke, and the trade to East Indies doth farre excell all other&quot;.

==Family==
Abbot married, firstly, Joan, daughter of George Austen, of Shalford, near Guildford, by whom he had five children.
* Morris, one of his sons, was called to the bar as a member of the Inner Temple, and was one of the executors of the will of his uncle, the archbishop, who left him several legacies.
*George (1602–1645), became a probationer fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1622, and was admitted bachelor of civil law in 1630. He carried the great banner at the funeral of his uncle, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1633, and sat in the Long Parliament as M.P. for Guildford until his death in 1645. 
*Edward, was, it appears from petitions to the House of Lords in 1641, in continual pecuniary difficulties.

After the death of his first wife in 1597, Abbot married, for the second time, Margaret, daughter of Bartholomew Barnes, an alderman of London, and she died on 5 September 1630.

1635 Abbot erected an elaborate monument in Holy Trinity Church, Guildford, to the memory of his brother, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had died two years previously, and had appointed Abbot an executor under his will.

<text>The Army Comrades Association (ACA), later the National Guard, then Young Ireland and finally League of Youth, but best known by the nickname the Blueshirts (), was a paramilitary organisation in the Irish Free State, founded as the Army Comrades Association in Dublin on 9 February 1932. The group provided physical protection for political groups such as Cumann na nGaedheal from intimidation and attacks by the IRA. Some former members went on to fight for the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War after the group had been dissolved.

Most of the political parties whose meetings the Blueshirts protected would merge to become Fine Gael, and members of that party are still sometimes nicknamed &quot;Blueshirts&quot;. There has been considerable debate in Irish historiography over whether or not it is accurate to describe the Blueshirts as fascists.

==History==
===Origins and early history===
In February 1932, the Fianna Fáil party was elected to lead the Irish Free State government. On 18 March 1932, the new government suspended the Public Safety Act, lifting the ban on a number of organisations including the Irish Republican Army. Some IRA political prisoners were also released around the same time. The IRA and many released prisoners began a &quot;campaign of unrelenting hostility&quot; against those associated with the former Cumann na nGaedheal government. Frank Ryan, one of the most prominent socialists in 1930s Ireland, active in both the Republican Congress and the IRA, declared &quot;as long as we have fists and boots, there will be no free speech for traitors&quot;. There were many cases of intimidation, attacks on persons, and the breaking-up of Cumann na nGaedheal political meetings in the coming months. In view of the increased activities of the IRA, National Army Commandant Ned Cronin founded the Army Comrades Association in Dublin on 11 August 1932. As its name suggested, it was designed for Irish Army veterans, a society for former members of the Free State army. The ACA felt that freedom of speech was being repressed, and began to provide security at Cumann na nGaedheal events. This led to several serious clashes between the IRA and the ACA. In August 1932, Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins became the leader of the ACA. O&#x27;Higgins was joined in the organisation by fellow Cumann na nGaedhael TDs Ernest Blythe, Patrick McGilligan and Desmond Fitzgerald. O&#x27;Higgins had been chosen as leader partially because his brother Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, who had been Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Justice, had been assassinated by the IRA in 1927.

By September 1932 the organisation claimed it had over 30,000 members. The historian Mike Cronin believes the Blueshirts regularly embellished their numbers and the actual amount was closer to 8,000 at that point. Women members were termed &quot;Blue Blouses&quot;.

===Eoin O&#x27;Duffy becomes leader===

In January 1933, the Fianna Fáil government called a surprise election, which the government won comfortably. The election campaign saw a serious escalation of rioting between IRA and ACA supporters. In April 1933, the ACA began wearing the distinctive blueshirt uniform.
Eoin O&#x27;Duffy was a guerrilla leader in the IRA in the Irish War of Independence, a National Army general in the Irish Civil War, and the Garda Síochána police commissioner in the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1933. After Fianna Fáil&#x27;s re-election in February 1933, President of the Executive Council Éamon de Valera dismissed O&#x27;Duffy as commissioner after learning O&#x27;Duffy had considered staging a coup d&#x27;état to remove him from power. That July, O&#x27;Duffy was offered and accepted leadership of the ACA and renamed it the National Guard. He re-modelled the organisation, adopting elements of European fascism, such as the straight-arm Roman salute, the wearing of uniforms and huge rallies. Membership of the new organisation became limited to people who were Irish or whose parents &quot;profess the Christian faith&quot;. O&#x27;Duffy was an admirer of Benito Mussolini, and the Blueshirts adopted corporatism as a chief political aim. According to the constitution he adopted, the organisation was to have the following objectives:

* To promote the re-union of Ireland.
* To oppose Communism and alien control and influence in national affairs and to uphold Christian principles in every sphere of public activity.
* To promote and maintain social order.
* To make organised and disciplined voluntary public service a permanent and accepted feature of our political life and to lead the youth of Ireland in a movement of constructive national action.
* To promote the formation of co-ordinated national organisations of employers and employed, which, with the aid of judicial tribunals, will effectively prevent strikes and lock-outs and harmoniously compose industrial influences.
* To co-operate with the official agencies of the state for the solution of such pressing social problems as the provision of useful and economic public employment for those whom private enterprise cannot absorb.
* To secure the creation of a representative national statutory organisation of farmers, with rights and status sufficient to secure the safeguarding of agricultural interests, in all revisions of agricultural and political policy. 
* To expose and prevent corruption and victimisation in national and local administration.
* To awaken throughout the country a spirit of combination, discipline, zeal and patriotic realism which will put the state in a position to serve the people efficiently in the economic and social spheres.

===March on Dublin===
The National Guard planned to hold a parade in Dublin in August 1933. It was to proceed to Glasnevin Cemetery, stopping briefly on Leinster lawn in front of the Irish parliament, where speeches were to be held. The goal of the parade was to commemorate Irish leaders Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and Kevin O&#x27;Higgins. It is clear that the IRA and other fringe groups representing various socialists intended to confront the Blueshirts if they marched in Dublin.

On 22 August 1933 the Fianna Fáil government, remembering Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome, and fearing a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, invoked article 2A of the constitution and banned the parade. Decades later, de Valera told Fianna Fáil politicians that in late summer 1933 he was unsure whether the Irish Army would obey his orders to suppress the perceived threat, or whether the soldiers would support the Blueshirts (who included many ex-soldiers). O&#x27;Duffy accepted the ban and insisted that he was committed to upholding the law. Instead, several provincial parades took place to commemorate the deaths of Griffith, O&#x27;Higgins and Collins. De Valera saw this move as defying his ban, and the Blueshirts were declared an illegal organisation.

===Merging with Cumann na nGaedhael and the National Centre Party to form Fine Gael===
In response to the banning of the National Guard, Cumann na nGaedheal and the National Centre Party merged to form a new party, Fine Gael, on 3 September 1933. O&#x27;Duffy became its first president, with W. T. Cosgrave and James Dillon acting as vice-presidents. O&#x27;Duffy was chosen as leader instead of Cosgrave and MacDermot in order to avoid the idea that Fine Gael would simply be a continuation of Cumann na nGaedhael. The National Guard changed its name to the Young Ireland Association, and became part of a youth wing of the party. The new party&#x27;s stated aim was to create a united Ireland within the British Commonwealth, although its programme made no mention of a corporatist state. In fact, the original name considered for the party was &quot;The United Ireland Party&quot; until Fine Gael was settled on. Labour Party leader William Norton was unimpressed; he surmised the new entity as &quot;an attempt to put old wine in new bottles”. Seán Lemass dismissed this triple alliance as &quot;the cripple alliance&quot;.

In March 1934 the Minister for Justice P. J. Ruttledge of Fianna Fáil brought forward a Wearing of Uniforms (Restriction) Bill which specifically sought to ban political uniforms in Irish public life. Badges, banners and military titles that were considered at odds with public peace were also to be prohibited. Ruttledge outright said as much that part of the aim was to end the Blueshirts, although said that in practice it would apply to every part of the political spectrum. However, following bitter debates in the Dáil, the bill was voted down in the Seanad 30 to 18.
The 1934 local elections, in June 1934, were a trial of strength for the new Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil government. When Fine Gael won only six out of 23 local elections, O&#x27;Duffy lost much of his authority and prestige. The Blueshirts had peaked by mid-1934 and rapidly began to disintegrate. A number of anti-establishment incidents were attributed to the Blueshirts during 1934, including their campaign against the payment of land annuities. The Blueshirts began to flounder on the plight of farmers in the Economic War, as the Blueshirts failed to provide a solution. In response to this, O&#x27;Duffy began to ramp up his extremist rhetoric. However, this prompted elements of Fine Gael such as Ernest Blythe, Michael Tierney and Desmond FitzGerald to begin working to remove O&#x27;Duffy from power.

Following disagreements with his Fine Gael colleagues, O&#x27;Duffy left the party in September 1934, although most of the Blueshirts stayed in Fine Gael. Following O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s ascent to leadership of Fine Gael, control of the Blueshirts had been left to original Blueshirt founder Ned Cronin. When O&#x27;Duffy left Fine Gael, he attempted to resume this position, however, Cronin resisted, resulting in the Blueshirts splitting into pro-O&#x27;Duffy and pro-Cronin factions. Cronin and his faction wished to remain within Fine Gael while O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s faction left entirely. Cronin&#x27;s faction seemed to have been the majority of the membership.

In December 1934, O&#x27;Duffy attended the Montreux Fascist conference in Switzerland. He then founded the National Corporate Party, and later raised an Irish Brigade that took General Francisco Franco&#x27;s side in the Spanish Civil War, with disastrous results. Meanwhile, Fine Gael was brought back under the leadership of WT Cosgrove who had previously led Cumann na nGaedhael. Now acting as Deputy Leader was James Dillon, formerly of the National Centre Party, who helped reinforce pro-democratic views into the party. Dillon was a staunch defender of liberal democracy who in later years denounced Nazism as &quot;the devil himself with twentieth-century efficiency&quot;. He resigned from Fine Gael in 1942 due to his belief that Ireland should break neutrality and join the Allies to fight against Hitler. He later rejoined the party and became its leader after Richard Mulcahy.

==Legacy==
As a rule, the modern Fine Gael party strenuously avoids referring to the Blueshirts as having been a part of the founding of the party, although it is happy to acknowledge the lineage of Cumann na nGaedhael and the National Centre Party, as well as to draw a lineage back to Michael Collins. Above all, Eoin O&#x27;Duffy is never acknowledged as its first leader, instead W. T. Cosgrave is given the mantle. Nonetheless, &quot;Blueshirt&quot; continues to be used as a pejorative for members of Fine Gael to this day.

===Fascism debate===
Considerable debate has been held in Irish society across many decades over whether or not it is accurate to describe the Blueshirts as fascists.

Stanley G. Payne has argued that the Blueshirts &quot;really was never a fascist organization at all&quot;. Maurice Manning also did not consider them fascists, with their mixture of patriotic conservatism, militia activities and corporatism amounting &quot;to no more than a kind of Celtic Croix-de-Feu&quot;, and that ultimately the Blueshirts &quot;had much of the appearance but little enough of the substance of Fascism&quot;. Historians are divided on the extent to which the Blueshirts took a lead from Mussolini and his many imitators at that time. Some of the Blueshirts later went to fight for Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War because of his anti-communism. They imitated some aspects of the Mussolini movement, such as the coloured-shirt uniform, Roman salute and the March on Rome; however, Historian R. M. Douglas has opined that it is incorrect to portray them as an &quot;Irish manifestation of fascism&quot;.

Mike Cronin, an academic specialising in Irish political and cultural history, also concludes that the Blueshirts &quot;undoubtedly possessed certain fascist traits, but they were not fascists in the German or Italian sense&quot;. Instead, Cronin suggests the term &quot;Para-fascists&quot; is more appropriate, indicating that while they took on the outward trapping of fascism, they did not commit to the more radical elements. Cronin contends that while certain members of the Blueshirts did hold fascist views, they were effectively &quot;drowned out&quot; by the number of traditionally conservative members, particularly after the merger into Fine Gael. Nonetheless, Cronin also notes that the Blueshirts&#x27; potential for outright fascism should not be dismissed either.

Fearghal McGarry of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, has suggested that while O&#x27;Duffy can be thought of as a genuine fascist, despite his role as the leader he was not representative of the bulk of the blueshirt membership, and that the degree to which the Blueshirts should be thought of as fascists has been overemphasised by Irish Republicans in order to reinforce their anti-fascist credentials during the interwar period. McGarry has said the danger from the Blueshirts was not that they would turn Ireland into Fascist Italy, but into the Portuguese dictatorship that existed under Salazar at the time.

Paul Bew has also argued against the term &quot;fascist&quot; being applied to the Blueshirts, instead labelling them as &quot;angry rural conservatives&quot; engaged in populism, with the views of the average member being closer to that of the Irish Parliamentary Party or the Irish Land League than Italian Fascism. On the same line, Alvin Jackson has stated that while some of the Cumann na nGaedheal leadership &quot;flirted with paramilitarism and the trappings of fascism&quot;, in his view &quot;O’Duffy’s fondness for outrageous rhetoric and elaborate uniforms was more O&#x27;Connellite than Hitlerian&quot;. Historian J. J. Lee has remarked that &quot;Fascism was far too intellectually demanding for the bulk of the Blueshirts&quot;. Marxist historian John Newsinger disputes this line of thinking somewhat by agreeing that the rank and file of the Blueshirts were not ideologically fascists, but so long as the leadership was, the consequences of the Blueshirts coming to power would have been one-party state dictatorship.

Michael O&#x27;Riordan, an Irish anti-fascist who fought in the Spanish Civil War and led the Communist Party of Ireland for many decades, said of the ex-Blueshirts who later volunteered to fight in Spain: &quot;I never regarded them as fascists. They saw themselves as involved in a Christian crusade against &#x27;godless communism&#x27; in Spain; at worst, then, they were dupes.&quot;

In the aftermath of O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s departure from Fine Gael, most of the party settled back into &quot;traditional&quot; conservatism under the leadership of WT Cosgrove and James Dillon. However, this was not true of all of the membership. Ernest Blythe, the Cumann na nGaedhael minister who had been an enthusiastic member of the Blueshirts and heavily supported its gravitation towards corporatism, continued to support fascist causes in Ireland many years after the Blueshirts&#x27; demise. Blythe retired from public life in 1936 after the abolishment of the Senate but he continued to engage in politics. During the 1940s he supported and aided the openly fascist Ailtirí na hAiséirghe. Blythe advised Ailtirí na hAiséirghe&#x27;s leader Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin on the drafting of the party&#x27;s constitution, gave it backing in its journal &quot;The Leader&quot;, as well as making financial contributions towards the party. During the 1940s Blythe&#x27;s activities alarmed Ireland&#x27;s secret intelligence agency G2, whose intelligence files referred to him as a potential &quot;Irish Quisling&quot; and “100 per cent Nazi”.

Some commentators have suggested that rather than view the conflict between the Blueshirts and the IRA through the prism of fascism versus anti-fascism, in reality, the conflict should be seen as more akin to a political rehashing of the Irish Civil War that began against the backdrop of Fianna Fáil entering into government for the first time.

<text>Flash evaporation (or partial evaporation) is the partial vapor that occurs when a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling valve or other throttling device. This process is one of the simplest unit operations. If the throttling valve or device is located at the entry into a pressure vessel so that the flash evaporation occurs within the vessel, then the vessel is often referred to as a flash drum.

If the saturated liquid is a single-component liquid (for example, propane or liquid ammonia), a part of the liquid immediately &quot;flashes&quot; into vapor. Both the vapor and the residual liquid are cooled to the saturation temperature of the liquid at the reduced pressure. This is often referred to as &quot;auto-refrigeration&quot; and is the basis of most conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems.

If the saturated liquid is a multi-component liquid (for example, a mixture of propane, isobutane and normal butane), the flashed vapor is richer in the more volatile components than is the remaining liquid.

Uncontrolled flash evaporation can result in a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE).

==Flash evaporation of a single-component liquid==
The flash evaporation of a single-component liquid is an isenthalpic process and is often referred to as an adiabatic flash. The following equation, derived from a simple heat balance around the throttling valve or device, is used to predict how much of a single-component liquid is vaporized.

:formula_1

If the enthalpy data required for the above equation is unavailable, then the following equation may be used.

:formula_2

Here, the words &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; refer to before and after the liquid passes through the throttling valve or device.

This type of flash evaporation is used in the desalination of brackish water or ocean water by &quot;Multi-Stage Flash Distillation.&quot; The water is heated and then routed into a reduced-pressure flash evaporation &quot;stage&quot; where some of the water flashes into steam. This steam is subsequently condensed into salt-free water. The residual salty liquid from that first stage is introduced into a second flash evaporation stage at a pressure lower than the first stage pressure. More water is flashed into steam which is also subsequently condensed into more salt-free water. This sequential use of multiple flash evaporation stages is continued until the design objectives of the system are met. A large part of the world&#x27;s installed desalination capacity uses multi-stage flash distillation. Typically such plants have 24 or more sequential stages of flash evaporation.

==Equilibrium flash of a multi-component liquid==
The equilibrium flash of a multi-component liquid may be visualized as a simple distillation process using a single equilibrium stage. It is very different and more complex than the flash evaporation of single-component liquid. For a multi-component liquid, calculating the amounts of flashed vapor and residual liquid in equilibrium with each other at a given temperature and pressure requires a trial-and-error iterative solution. Such a calculation is commonly referred to as an equilibrium flash calculation. It involves solving the &quot;Rachford-Rice equation&quot;:

:formula_3

where:

* &quot;zi&quot; is the mole fraction of component &quot;i&quot; in the feed liquid (assumed to be known);
* &quot;β&quot; is the fraction of feed that is vaporised;
* &quot;Ki&quot; is the equilibrium constant of component &quot;i&quot;.

The equilibrium constants &quot;Ki&quot; are in general functions of many parameters, though the most important is arguably temperature; they are defined as:

:formula_4

where:

* &quot;xi&quot; is the mole fraction of component &quot;i&quot; in liquid phase;
* &quot;yi&quot; is the mole fraction of component &quot;i&quot; in gas phase.

Once the Rachford-Rice equation has been solved for &quot;β&quot;, the compositions &quot;xi&quot; and &quot;yi&quot; can be immediately calculated as:

:formula_5

The Rachford-Rice equation can have multiple solutions for &quot;β&quot;, at most one of which guarantees that all &quot;xi&quot; and &quot;yi&quot; will be positive. In particular, if there is only one &quot;β&quot; for which:

:formula_6

then that &quot;β&quot; is the solution; if there are multiple such &quot;β&quot;&#x27;s, it means that either &quot;K&quot;max&lt;1 or &quot;K&quot;min&gt;1, indicating respectively that no gas phase can be sustained (and therefore &quot;β&quot;=0) or conversely that no liquid phase can exist (and therefore &quot;β&quot;=1).

It is possible to use Newton&#x27;s method for solving the above water equation, but there is a risk of converging to the wrong value of &quot;β&quot;; it is important to initialise the solver to a sensible initial value, such as (&quot;βmax&quot;+&quot;βmin&quot;)/2 (which is however not sufficient: Newton&#x27;s method makes no guarantees on stability), or, alternatively, use a bracketing solver such as the bisection method or the Brent method, which are guaranteed to converge but can be slower.

The equilibrium flash of multi-component liquids is very widely utilized in petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants and natural gas processing plants.

==Contrast with spray drying==
Spray drying is sometimes seen as a form of flash evaporation. However, although it is a form of liquid evaporation, it is quite different from flash evaporation.

In spray drying, a slurry of very small solids is rapidly dried by suspension in a hot gas. The slurry is first atomized into very small liquid droplets which are then sprayed into a stream of hot dry air. The liquid rapidly evaporates leaving behind dry powder or dry solid granules. The dry powder or solid granules are recovered from the exhaust air by using cyclones, bag filters or electrostatic precipitators.

==Natural flash evaporation==
Natural flash vaporization or flash deposition may occur during earthquakes resulting in deposition of minerals held in supersaturated solutions, sometimes even valuable ore in the case of auriferous, gold-bearing, waters. This results when blocks of rock are rapidly pulled and pushed away from each other by jog faults.

<text>Jacques Heath Futrelle (April 9, 1875 – April 15, 1912) was an American journalist and mystery writer. He is best known for writing short detective stories featuring Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen, also known as &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; for his use of logic. Futrelle died in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

== Career ==
Futrelle was born in Pike County, Georgia. He worked for the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;, where he began their sports section, the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, the &quot;Boston Post&quot; and the &quot;Boston American&quot;, where, in 1905, his Thinking Machine character appeared in a serialized version of the short story, &quot;The Problem of Cell 13&quot;.

Futrelle left the &quot;Boston American&quot; in 1906 to write novels. He had a harbor-view house built in Scituate, Massachusetts, which he called &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, and spent most of his time there until his death in 1912. His last work, &quot;My Lady&#x27;s Garter&quot;, was published posthumously in 1912. His widow inscribed in the book, &quot;To the heroes of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, I dedicate this my husband&#x27;s book&quot;, under a photo of him.

==Personal life==

In 1895, he married fellow writer Lily May Peel with whom he had two children, Virginia and Jacques &quot;John&quot; Jr. His great-grandson is writer David Futrelle.

==Death==
Returning from Europe aboard the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, Futrelle, a first-class passenger, refused to board a lifeboat, insisting Lily do so instead, to the point of forcing her in. She remembered the last she saw of him: he was smoking a cigarette on deck with John Jacob Astor IV. He perished in the Atlantic and his body was never found. On July 29, 1912, Futrelle&#x27;s mother, Linnie Futrelle, died in her Georgia home; her death was attributed to grief over her son.

==In popular culture==
Futrelle is used as the protagonist in Max Allan Collins&#x27; disaster series novel &quot;The Titanic Murders&quot; (1999), about two murders aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

== Selected works ==

=== Novels ===
* &quot;The Chase of the Golden Plate&quot; (1906)
* &quot;The Simple Case of Susan&quot; (1908)

<text>The Policy Analysis Market (PAM), part of the FutureMAP project, was a proposed futures exchange developed, beginning in May 2001, by the Information Awareness Office (IAO) of the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and based on an idea first proposed by Net Exchange, a San Diego, California, research firm specializing in the development of online prediction markets. PAM was shut down in August 2003 after multiple US senators condemned it as an assassination and terrorism market, a characterization criticized in turn by futures-exchange expert Robin Hanson of George Mason University, and several journalists. Since PAM&#x27;s closure, several private-sector variations on the idea have been launched.

== Proposal ==

PAM was to be &quot;a market in the future of the Middle East&quot;, and would have allowed trading of futures contracts based on possible political developments in several Middle Eastern countries. The theory behind such a market is that the monetary value of a futures contract on an event reflects the probability that that event will actually occur, since a market&#x27;s actors rationally bid a contract either up or down based on reliable information. One of the models for PAM was a political futures market run by the University of Iowa, which had predicted US election outcomes more accurately than either opinion polls or political pundits. PAM was also inspired by the work of George Mason University economist Robin Hanson.

== Opposition ==

At a July 28, 2003, press conference, US Senators Byron L. Dorgan (D-ND) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) claimed that PAM would allow trading in such events as , assassinations, and terrorist attacks, due to such events appearing on interface pictures on the project website. &quot;On the web site, as a backdrop to bold text, were faint background sample screens. In a small (less than 2 percent) section of two such screens, Polk had included as colorful examples of possible miscellaneous items an assassination of Yasser Arafat, a missile attack by North Korea, and the overthrow of the king of Jordan.&quot;

They denounced the idea, with Wyden stating, &quot;The idea of a federal betting parlor on atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous and it&#x27;s grotesque&quot;, while Dorgan called it &quot;useless, offensive and unbelievably stupid&quot;. Other critics offered similar outrage. Within less than a day, the Pentagon announced the cancellation of PAM, and by the end of the week John Poindexter, head of the DARPA unit responsible for developing it, had offered his resignation. 

PAM had first been proposed and funded in 2001, Poindexter joined DARPA in December 2002, and Hanson claimed that Poindexter &quot;actually had little involvement with PAM&quot;.

== Further developments ==

CNN reported the program would be relaunched by the private firm, Net Exchange, that helped create it, but that the newer version &quot;will not include any securities based on forecasts of violent events such as assassinations or terror attacks&quot;.

On June 11, 2007, &quot;Popular Science&quot; launched a similar program, known as the PopSci Predictions Exchange. Another project was the American Action Market announced by Tad Hirsh of the MIT Media Lab in 2003, which would permit for-profit betting on major events.

There are now commercial policy-analysis markets that perform such functions. One, Intrade, had previously offered futures on events such as the capture of Osama bin Laden, the US Presidential Election, and the bombing of Iran. As of March 10, 2013, all trading had been suspended on Intrade&#x27;s website due to undisclosed financial irregularities.

<text>Black &amp; White Records was an American record company and label founded by Les Schreiber in 1943. It specialized in jazz and blues. When the label was sold to Paul and Lillian Reiner, it moved from New York City to Los Angeles. The catalog included music by Art Hodes, Cliff Jackson, Lil Armstrong, Barney Bigard, Wilbert Baranco, Erroll Garner, Jack McVea, and Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith.

Ralph Bass was the recording director. The name was chosen to indicate that black and white musicians were signed to the label.

==Early days==
Black &amp; White Records was founded in 1943 by Les Schreiber (1901–1965), and was located at 2117 Foster Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. The company initially issued recordings by Art Hodes and Cliff Jackson.

In 1945, Paul Reiner (6 December 1905, Hungary–1 February 1982, Los Angeles) and his wife, Lillian (&quot;&quot; Drosd; 28 April 1908, Massachusetts–4 September 1982, Los Angeles), purchased the company, moved it to Los Angeles, and hired Ralph Bass to be recording director. Soon after that, Schreiber worked for Swan Records but left Swan around October 1946. Paul Reiner was president, his wife was vice president, Samuel Madiman was treasurer, and Larry Newton was sales manager.

Bass oversaw two of the most important records in the early evolution of rock and roll: &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; by T-Bone Walker (1946) and a rare crossover hit, &quot;Open the Door, Richard&quot; by Jack McVea (1947). In 1948, Bass left Black &amp; White to start Bop Records.

==Sales and agreements==
Comet Records, owned by Les Schreiber, was sold to Black &amp; White Records not long after their third recording session (with Red Norvo and Charlie Parker).

On August 11, 1947, B&amp;W Records and Jewel Records (not to be confused with Je–Wel) entered a distribution agreement that gave B&amp;W an option to acquire Jewel. Reiner retained his post as president of B&amp;W while Ben Pollack, Jewel&#x27;s president, entered as general manager of B&amp;W&#x27;s West Coast operations, overseeing the A&amp;R department. Reiner moved his headquarters east and centered his operations on Chicago to strengthen the label&#x27;s Midwestern distribution. The catalogues of B&amp;W and Jewel were merged as a result of the deal. Pollack brought 10 unreleased masters and Martha Davis and Marion Morgan. Pollack also had a contract with Boyd Raeburn stipulating that the orchestra could record for a major label, but Jewel held an exclusive on all independent releases. The deal also increased the number of race records, i.e. records made by blacks that were marketed to blacks.

The first recording of &quot;Open the Door, Richard&quot; by Jack McVea was recorded on this label. Lena Horne recorded for this label in 1946 and 1947. Although they were novices in the business and were not specializing in rhythm and blues (R&amp;B), they made a significant contribution, largely through the efforts of Bass, who recorded Roosevelt Sykes and T-Bone Walker.

In March 1949, Newton left B&amp;W as sales manager to become general manager of Peak Records. Moses Asch replaced him as sales manager at B&amp;W. Around that same time in 1949, Newton, while operating Derby, started Central Records with Lee Magid, and Treat Records in New York City; worked with Impulse! Records, became president of ABC-Paramount Records in 1965, and ran Crossover Records (founded in 1973 by Ray Charles).

==Masters==
On October 8, 1949, after shutting down B&amp;W Records, Paul Reiner offered several hundred masters for sale, some released, some not. He appointed Al Katz (Katzenberger) to negotiate sales on his behalf. The sale was offered in units, ordered by artists. Katz gave first right of refusal to the artists.

Reiner had sold the masters from sessions by Art Tatum, Cyril Nathaniel Haynes, and Red Norvo/Charlie Parker to Ross Russell, the owner of Dial Records. The deal was closed via telephone on June 21, 1949.

Capitol Records bought the Black &amp; White masters of T-Bone Walker in 1949 and gave the titles new matrix numbers. Capitol then issued 16 tracks on 8 individual 78rpm shellac disks (10 previously unreleased masters and 6 reissued masters) in 1949 through 1950. Capitol also put out a 10&quot; LP consisting of 8 of these 16 tracks in 1953, titled &quot;T-Bone Walker: Classics in Jazz&quot; (Capitol H-370).

Black &amp; White was one of the first companies to issue 12-inch 78 rpm discs in unbreakable material.

==Cover version controversy==
In 1948, Supreme Records recorded in Los Angeles and released &quot;A Little Bird Told Me,&quot; written by Harvey Oliver Brooks (1899–1968), sung by Paula Watson (1927–2003), who is African American, accompanied by guitarist Mitchell &quot;Tiny&quot; Webb, and others. Her version spent 14 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B charts in 1948 and 1949, reaching number 2 on the R&amp;B charts and number 6 on the pop charts. In 1948, Decca released a cover version, sung by Evelyn Knight (1917–2007), who was white. Knight copied Watson&#x27;s singing to the degree that it fooled musical experts brought into court as witnesses. Knight was accompanied by a band that included Walter Page on bass, the Stardusters (vocal group), and Johnny Parker (vocal and hand-clapping). Supreme claimed that Decca had stolen aspects of its original recording, including its arrangement, texture, and vocal style. Race was not an issue in the case, but the case served as an example of white performers covering the work of black artists in the 1950s.

The court ruled in favor of the defense, upholding a ruling that musical arrangements are not copyrightable property – individual interpretations or arrangements of a given style could not be protested under the law. This case opened the door for cover versions. In the 1950 ruling Supreme Records, Incorporated, a small label owned by Al Patrick (Albert T. Patrick; 1910–1973), who was African American, lost the case in United States District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division, against Decca Records, Inc., a large record label.

Black &amp; White Record Distributors, Inc. had been one of the two original plaintiffs but withdrew on a motion by the defendant, leaving Supreme as the sole plaintiff. Black &amp; White participated in the case because it had been the manufacturer and distributor of Supreme&#x27;s line.

Separately from the &quot;Little Bird&quot; case, Supreme had sued Black &amp; White, contending that B&amp;W had no right to turn over its line to two Canadian firms, Monogram and Dominion, who had been pressing and distributing in Canada. On April 2, 1949, Supreme &amp; B&amp;W settled their dispute out of court.

Supreme was soon out of business, and by December 1949, Paula Watson was working for Decca.

Black &amp; White Records had a publishing subsidiary, Paul Reiner Publishing Company.

<text>Richard D. James Album is the fourth studio album by the British electronic music artist and producer Richard D. James under the alias of Aphex Twin. It was released on 4November 1996 through Warp Records. It was composed by James on his Macintosh computer, and took longer to complete than his previous albums. It features fast breakbeats and intricate drum programming which draw from jungle and drum and bass. James&#x27; drum loops are paired with lush string arrangements, and ambient melodies reminiscent of his earlier work, as well as modulated vocals from James.

&quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; entered the Dance Albums Chart at No.7, and reached No.62 on the Albums Chart. In the US it charted at No.20 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers Albums chart. It had sold over 100,000 units by 1997, making it Warp&#x27;s most commercially successful release at the time. It received critical acclaim, with much of the praise going to its production. It has since been described as one of the best albums of 1996 and the 1990s overall by music critics.

==Background and production==
In 1995, Richard James released the two &quot;Hangable Auto Bulb&quot; EPs under his AFX moniker, experimenting with exaggerated rhythms inspired by drum and bass in a style that came to be called &quot;drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass&quot;. This faster style of drum programming was inspired by James&#x27; friend Luke Vibert, also known as Plug. James stated that while he worked with triplets and complicated beats in the past, that Vibert &quot;got me into doing it a faster pace. He gave me the spark to do it faster, but now I&#x27;m trying to take it to all extremes&quot;. This rapid, computer-based approach would become the dominant style of James&#x27;s work through the end of the decade. In the following year, James released the Aphex Twin EP &quot;Girl/Boy&quot;.

James has stated that most of the album was composed on his Macintosh computer and that the album took longer to create than any of his previous albums. Describing his approach to drum programming, he stated that &quot;sometimes I just hit the keyboard in a way I&#x27;d like the rhythm of the tracks to sound. Then I&#x27;ll spend four hours moving all the notes where I want them to go.&quot; Some tracks on the album include James&#x27; vocals modulated on a computer; in &quot;To Cure a Weakling Child&quot;, James manipulated his voice to sound like a child giving a lecture about their arms and legs. For the orchestral arrangements on the album, James bought a violin at a car boot sale. He taught himself to play a note from the instrument by placing it on a table, playing a note and sampling the note.

==Composition==
&quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; is a work of electronica that has been characterised as James&#x27;s &quot;swan dive into jungle and drill&#x27;n&#x27;bass&quot; by &quot;Vice&quot; Dan Wiess, and labeled as a work of IDM by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, working with jungle, drum and bass and ambient and acid techno in some tracks. Andrew Speiss of &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted that &#x27;[w]hat makes &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; stand out among James&#x27; previous works is the synthesis of delicate, symphonic sounds and hard, jackhammering beats,&quot; noting that the album consolidated his 1995 entry into the short-lived drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass subgenre. James has claimed the influence of jungle music came from &quot;any of the drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass and breakbeat artists&quot; and that he has &quot;always been into nicking other things [...] and making something different&quot;. Patrick Fallon of &quot;Stereogum&quot; noted the album heavily relies on drum programming, sampling, and &quot;other digital intricacies that would&#x27;ve been otherwise unthinkable without computers&quot;. It also features lush string arrangements and simple keyboard textures built over quadruple time breakbeats. A reviewer for &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot; wrote that the album used unstable time signatures. Steve Taylor found the record Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;most terrifying&quot; one, with &quot;weird stop-start beats, white noise and tough melodies.&quot;

John Bush of AllMusic noted that the album continued James&#x27;s &quot;forays into acid-jungle and experimental music,&quot; noting that the album was &quot;more extreme than virtually all jungle being made at the time&quot;, with beats layered over slower melodies that characterised James&#x27; earlier ambient works. Eric Carr of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; opined that the album was one of the &quot;aggressive combinations of disparate electronic forms&quot;, with &quot;almost-brutal contrast between its elements&quot;. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; commented that tracks such as &quot;Girl/Boy Song&quot;, &quot;Yellow Calx&quot;, and &quot;Peek 824545201&quot; were &quot;loosely based on jungle&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; Will Hermes linked the album&#x27;s use of vocals, both sung and sampled, its cover artwork and title, stating that &quot;&quot;Richard D. James&quot; might be the first electronica LP that not only gropes for narrative but also aspired to an abstract sort of autobiography.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; was released through Warp on 4 November 1996. It was released on compact disc, cassette and gramophone record; early copies of the album were distributed with a plastic sachet containing James&#x27; hair. The American version included the &quot;Girl/Boy EP&quot; as bonus tracks. The album entered at number 7 on the Dance Albums Chart and at number62 on the Albums Chart in the UK, on 16November 1996. It was released in the United States through Sire Records on 28 January 1997 and charted at number 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers Albums chart. By November 1997, it had sold over 100,000 copies and became Warp&#x27;s most commercially successful release at the time, the former of which surprised James.

Along with &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; (1995), &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; was reissued on vinyl on 18 September 2012 by record label 1972. Warp announced their own re-issue of the album on 180-gram vinyl for 8 October 2012.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; received critical acclaim from music critics. In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Independent&quot; gave album a positive review, stating that &quot;The intuitive sense of melody [James] has been striving so hard to suppress over the last few years has come to the fore too, and the result is the most magical pop record of the year: the year in question being AD 2001&quot;. In North America, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Ryan Schreiber gave the album an 8.4 out of ten rating, stating that &quot;The &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; is 43.5 minutes of pure electronic genius&quot; and &quot;just when your brain starts to comprehend a rhythmic pattern, the beat shifts, turns left and crushes your torso under the steering wheel.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Jason Fine gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, commenting that &quot;Aphex Twin coaxes great emotional resonance from his machines&quot; and combines &quot;jolting beats, pristine melodic fragments and random noises into elegant – if at times unnerving – futuristic pop&quot;. However, he also commented that &quot;not all of &quot;Richard D. James&quot; goes down easy&quot;. Marc Widenbaum of &quot;The Pulse&quot; called the album, &quot;quite simply, the strongest art-pop record to appear since Laurie Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Heartbreak&quot;&quot;, defined by a &quot;series of lovely tunes atop a decisive, rhythmically fascinating girding of rapid-fire, turn-on-a-dime percussion.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer David Browne awarded the album an A−, calling it James&#x27; &quot;quirkiest, most personal work&quot; and said that &quot;4&quot; and &quot;Girl/Boy Song&quot; revealed &quot;a new warmth and wistfulness.&quot; Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the album a negative review, referring to the music as &quot;sloppy offhand&quot;, &quot;a noisy mess&quot; and sounding &quot;like a private joke&quot;.

&quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; was placed in numerous best-of lists. &quot;NME&quot; placed the album at number 20 on their list of the best albums of 1996. &quot;The Wire&quot; also listed the album among their top 50 albums of the year for 1996. In 2003 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed their top albums of the 1990s, with &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; ranking at 40. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that &quot;RDJ&quot; is not &quot;easily dated by [its] technology&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t &quot;sound stale compared to modern variations.&quot; Also in 2003, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it 55th in their list of the top 100 albums of all time. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed the album at number 91 on their list of the top 100 albums of the 1990s, describing it as &quot;more fascinated by textures than almost any other electronic album ever crafted&quot;. In 2015 &quot;Spin&quot; placed the album at number 71 on their list of the best albums of the past 30 years. In the same year, &quot;Exclaim!&quot; listed &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; on their list of Essential Richard D. James albums. The review opined that the album was &quot;not necessarily a release that you immediately fall in love with&quot;, but that it was &quot;endlessly rewarding&quot;. &quot;Evening Standard&quot; named it among &quot;the most influential electronica albums of the past 20 years.&quot; In 2019, &quot;Reverb&quot; called the album &quot;perhaps the best-known IDM release of all time&quot; and a &quot;highwater mark&quot; for the genre.

<doc id="286245" wikidata="Q54910469" url="?curid=286245" title="Sodium silicate">
<text>Sodium silicate is a generic name for chemical compounds with the formula or ·, such as sodium metasilicate (), sodium orthosilicate (), and sodium pyrosilicate (). The anions are often polymeric. These compounds are generally colorless transparent solids or white powders, and soluble in water in various amounts.

Sodium silicate is also the technical and common name for a mixture of such compounds, chiefly the metasilicate, also called waterglass, water glass, or liquid glass. The product has a wide variety of uses, including the formulation of cements, coatings, passive fire protection, textile and lumber processing, manufacture of refractory ceramics, as adhesives, and in the production of silica gel. The commercial product, available in water solution or in solid form, is often greenish or blue owing to the presence of iron-containing impurities.

In industry, the various grades of sodium silicate are characterized by their SiO2:Na2O weight ratio (which can be converted to molar ratio by multiplication with 1.032). The ratio can vary between 1:2 and 3.75:1. Grades with ratio below 2.85:1 are termed alkaline. Those with a higher SiO2:Na2O ratio are described as neutral.

==History==
Soluble silicates of alkali metals (sodium or potassium) were observed by European alchemists in the 16th century. Giambattista della Porta observed in 1567 that &quot;tartari salis&quot; (cream of tartar, potassium bitartrate) caused powdered &quot;crystallum&quot; (quartz) to melt at a lower temperature. Other possible early references to alkali silicates were made by Basil Valentine in 1520, and by Agricola in 1550. Around 1640, Jan Baptist van Helmont reported the formation of alkali silicates as a soluble substance made by melting sand with excess alkali, and observed that the silica could be precipitated quantitatively by adding acid to the solution.

In 1646, Glauber made potassium silicate, which he called &quot;liquor silicum&quot;, by melting potassium carbonate (obtained by calcinating cream of tartar) and sand in a crucible, and keeping it molten until it ceased to bubble (due to the release of carbon dioxide). The mixture was allowed to cool and then was ground to a fine powder. When the powder was exposed to moist air, it gradually formed a viscous liquid, which Glauber called &quot;Oleum oder Liquor Silicum, Arenæ, vel Crystallorum&quot; (i.e., oil or solution of silica, sand or quartz crystal).

However, it was later claimed that the substances prepared by those alchemists were not waterglass as it is understood today. That would have been prepared in 1818 by Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs, by treating silicic acid with an alkali; the result being soluble in water, &quot;but not affected by atmospheric changes&quot;.

The terms &quot;water glass&quot; and &quot;soluble glass&quot; were used by Leopold Wolff in 1846, by Émile Kopp in 1857, and by Hermann Krätzer in 1887.

In 1892, Rudolf Von Wagner distinguished soda, potash, double (soda and potash), and fixing (i.e., stabilizing) as types of water glass. The fixing type was &quot;a mixture of silica well saturated with potash water glass and a sodium silicate&quot; used to stabilize inorganic water color pigments on cement work for outdoor signs and murals.

==Properties==
Sodium silicates are colorless glassy or crystalline solids, or white powders. Except for the most silicon-rich ones, they are readily soluble in water, producing alkaline solutions. When dried up it still can be rehydrated in water.

Sodium silicates are stable in neutral and alkaline solutions. In acidic solutions, the silicate ions react with hydrogen ions to form silicic acids, which tend to decompose into hydrated silicon dioxide gel. Heated to drive off the water, the result is a hard translucent substance called silica gel, widely used as a desiccant. It can withstand temperatures up to 1100 °C.

==Production==
Solutions of sodium silicates can be produced by treating a mixture of silica (usually as quartz sand), caustic soda, and water, with hot steam in a reactor. The overall reaction is
: 2&quot;x&quot; NaOH + → · + &quot;x&quot; 

Sodium silicates can also be obtained by dissolving silica (whose melting point is 1713 °C) in molten sodium carbonate (that melts with decomposition at 851 °C):
: &quot;x&quot; + → · + &quot;x&quot; 
The material can be obtained also from sodium sulfate (melting point 884 °C) with carbon as a reducing agent:
: 2&quot;x&quot; + C + 2 → 2 · + 2 + 

In 1990, 4 million tons of alkali metal silicates were produced.

=== Ferrosilicon ===

Sodium silicate may be produced as a part of hydrogen production by dissolving ferrosilicon in an aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH·H2O) solution:

: 2NaOH + Si + H2O → 2Na2SiO3 + 2H2

=== Bayer process ===
Though unprofitable, Na2SiO3 is a byproduct of Bayer process which is often converted to calcium silicate (Ca2SiO4).

== Uses ==
The main applications of sodium silicates are in detergents, paper industry (as a deinking agent), water treatment, and construction materials.

=== Adhesives ===

The adhesive properties of sodium silicate were noted as early as the 1850s and have been widely used at least since the First World War. The largest application of sodium silicate solutions is a cement for producing cardboard. When used as a paper cement, the sodium silicate joint tends to crack within a few years, at which point it no longer holds the paper surfaces cemented together.

Sodium silicate solutions can also be used as a spin-on adhesive layer to bond glass to glass or a silicon dioxide–covered silicon wafer to one another. Sodium silicate glass-to-glass bonding has the advantage that it is a low-temperature bonding technique, as opposed to fusion bonding. It also requires less processing than glass-to-glass anodic bonding, which requires an intermediate layer such as silicon nitride (SiN) to act as a diffusion barrier for sodium ions. The deposition of such a layer requires a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition step. A disadvantage of sodium silicate bonding, however, is that it is very difficult to eliminate air bubbles. This is in part because the technique does not require a vacuum and also does not use field assistance as in anodic bonding. This lack of field assistance can sometimes be beneficial, because field assistance can provide such high attraction between wafers as to bend a thinner wafer and collapse onto nanofluidic cavity or MEMS elements.

=== Coatings ===

Sodium silicate may be used for various paints and coatings, such as those used on welding rods. Such coatings can be cured in two ways. One method is to heat a thin layer of sodium silicate into a gel and then into a hard film. To make the coating water-resistant, high temperatures of are needed. The temperature is slowly raised to to dehydrate the film and avoid steaming and blistering. The process must be relatively slow, but infrared lamps may be used at first. In the other method, when high temperatures are not practical, the water resistance may be achieved by chemicals (or esters), such as boric acid, phosphoric acid, sodium fluorosilicate, and aluminium phosphate. Before application, an aqueous solution of sodium silicate is mixed with a curing agent.

It is used in detergent auxiliaries such as complex sodium disilicate and modified sodium disilicate. The detergent granules gain their ruggedness from a coating of silicates.

=== Water treatment ===

Sodium silicate is used as an alum coagulant and an iron flocculant in wastewater treatment plants. Sodium silicate binds to colloidal molecules, creating larger aggregates that sink to the bottom of the water column. The microscopic negatively charged particles suspended in water interact with sodium silicate. Their electrical double layer collapses due to the increase of ionic strength caused by the addition of sodium silicate (doubly negatively charged anion accompanied by two sodium cations) and they subsequently aggregate. This process is called coagulation.

=== Foundries, refractories and pottery ===

It is used as a binder of the sand when doing sand casting of all common metals. It allows for the rapid production of a strong mold or core by three main methods.

* Method 1 requires passing carbon dioxide gas through the mixture of sand and sodium silicate in the sand molding box or core box. The carbon dioxide reacts with the sodium silicate to form solid silica gel and sodium carbonate. This provides adequate strength to remove the now hardened sand shape from the forming tool. Additional strength occurs as any unreacted sodium silicate in the sand shape dehydrates.
* Method 2 requires adding an ester (reaction product of an acid and an alcohol) to the mixture of sand and sodium silicate before it is placed into the molding box or core box. As the ester hydrolyzes from the water in the liquid sodium silicate, an acid is released which causes the liquid sodium silicate to gel. Once the gel has formed, it will dehydrate to a glassy phase as a result of syneresis. Commonly used esters include acetate esters of glycerol and ethylene glycol as well as carbonate esters of propylene and ethylene glycol. The higher the water solubility of the ester, the faster the hardening of the sand.
* Method 3 requires microwave energy to heat and dehydrate the mixture of sand and sodium silicate in the sand molding box or core box. The forming tools must pass through microwaves for this to work well. Because sodium silicate has a high dielectric constant, it absorbs microwave energy very rapidly. Fully dehydrated sand shapes can be produced within a minute of microwave exposure. This method produces the highest strength of sand shapes bonded with sodium silicate.

Since the sodium silicate does not burn during casting (it can actually melt at pouring temperatures above 1800 °F), it is common to add organic materials to provide for enhanced sand breakdown after casting. The additives include sugar, starch, carbons, wood flour and phenolic resins.

Water glass is a useful binder for solids, such as vermiculite and perlite. When blended with the latter lightweight fraction, water glass can be used to make hard, high-temperature insulation boards used for refractories, passive fire protection, and high-temperature insulations, such as in moulded pipe insulation applications. When mixed with finely divided mineral powders, such as vermiculite dust (which is common scrap from the exfoliation process), one can produce high temperature adhesives. The intumescence disappears in the presence of finely divided mineral dust, whereby the waterglass becomes a mere matrix. Waterglass is inexpensive and abundantly available, which makes its use popular in many refractory applications.

Sodium silicate is used as a deflocculant in casting slips helping reduce viscosity and the need for large amounts of water to liquidize the clay body. It is also used to create a crackle effect in pottery, usually wheel-thrown. A vase or bottle is thrown on the wheel, fairly narrow and with thick walls. Sodium silicate is brushed on a section of the piece. After five minutes, the wall of the piece is stretched outward with a rib or hand. The result is a wrinkled or cracked look.

It is also the main agent in &quot;magic water&quot;, which is used when joining clay pieces, especially if the moisture level of the two differs.

=== Dyes ===

Sodium silicate solution is used as a fixative for hand dyeing with reactive dyes that require a high pH to react with the textile fiber. After the dye is applied to a cellulose-based fabric, such as cotton or rayon, or onto silk, it is allowed to dry, after which the sodium silicate is painted on to the dyed fabric, covered with plastic to retain moisture, and left to react for an hour at room temperature.

=== Repair work ===

Sodium silicate is used, along with magnesium silicate, in muffler repair and fitting paste. Magnesium silicate can be mixed with a solution of sodium silicate to form a thick paste that is easy to apply. When the exhaust system of an internal combustion engine heats up to its operating temperature, the heat drives out all of the excess water from the paste. The silicate compounds that are left over have glass-like properties, making a temporary, brittle repair that can be reinforced with glass fibre.

Sodium silicate can be used to fill gaps in the head gasket of an engine. This is especially useful for aluminium alloy cylinder heads, which are sensitive to thermally induced surface deflection. Sodium silicate is added to the cooling system through the radiator and allowed to circulate. When the sodium silicate reaches its &quot;conversion&quot; temperature of , it loses water molecules and forms a glass seal with a re-melting temperature above . This repair can last two years or longer, and symptoms disappear instantly. However, this repair works only when the sodium silicate reaches its &quot;conversion&quot; temperature. Also, sodium silicate (glass particulate) contamination of lubricants is detrimental to their function, and contamination of engine oil is a serious possibility in situations in which a coolant-to-oil leak is present.

Sodium silicate solution is used to inexpensively, quickly, and permanently disable automobile engines. Running an engine with half a U.S. gallon (or about two liters) of a sodium silicate solution instead of motor oil causes the solution to precipitate, catastrophically damaging the engine&#x27;s bearings and pistons within a few minutes. In the United States, this procedure was used to comply with requirements of the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) program.

=== Construction ===

A mixture of sodium silicate and sawdust has been used in between the double skin of certain safes. This not only makes them more fire resistant, but also makes cutting them open with an oxyacetylene torch extremely difficult due to the smoke emitted.

Sodium silicate is frequently used in drilling fluids to stabilize and avoid the collapse of borehole walls. It is particularly useful when drill holes pass through argillaceous formations containing swelling clay minerals such as smectite or montmorillonite.

Concrete treated with a sodium silicate solution helps to reduce porosity in most masonry products such as concrete, stucco, and plasters. This effect aids in reducing water penetration, but has no known effect on reducing water vapor transmission and emission. A chemical reaction occurs with the excess Ca(OH)2 (portlandite) present in the concrete that permanently binds the silicates with the surface, making them far more durable and water repellent. This treatment generally is applied only after the initial cure has taken place (approximately seven days depending on conditions). These coatings are known as silicate mineral paint. An example of the reaction of sodium silicate with the calcium hydroxide found in concrete to form calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) gel, the main product in hydrated Portland cement, follows.

=== Crystal gardens ===

When crystals of a number of metallic salts are dropped into a solution of water glass, simple or branching stalagmites of colored metal silicates are formed. This phenomenon has been used by manufacturers of toys and chemistry sets to provide instructive enjoyment to many generations of children from the early 20th century until the present. An early mention of crystals of metallic salts forming a &quot;chemical garden&quot; in sodium silicate is found in the 1946 &quot;Modern Mechanix&quot; magazine. Metal salts used included the sulfates and/or chlorides of copper, cobalt, iron, nickel, and manganese.

=== Sealants ===

Sodium silicate with additives was injected into the ground to harden it and thereby to prevent further leakage of highly radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan in April, 2011. The residual heat carried by the water used for cooling the damaged reactors accelerated the setting of the injected mixture.

On June 3, 1958, the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the world&#x27;s first nuclear submarine, visited Everett and Seattle. In Seattle, crewmen dressed in civilian clothing were sent in to secretly buy 140 quarts (160 liters) of an automotive product containing sodium silicate (originally identified as Stop Leak) to repair a leaking condenser system. The &quot;Nautilus&quot; was en route to the North Pole on a top secret mission to cross the North Pole submerged.

=== Firearms ===

A historical use of the adhesive properties of sodium silicates is the production of paper cartridges for black powder revolvers produced by Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company between 1851 and 1873, especially during the American Civil War. Sodium silicate was used to seal combustible nitrated paper together to form a conical paper cartridge to hold the black powder, as well as to cement the lead ball or conical bullet into the open end of the paper cartridge. Such sodium silicate cemented paper cartridges were inserted into the cylinders of revolvers, thereby speeding the reloading of cap-and-ball black powder revolvers. This use largely ended with the introduction of Colt revolvers employing brass-cased cartridges starting in 1873. Similarly, sodium silicate was also used to cement the top wad into brass shotgun shells, thereby eliminating any need for a crimp at the top of the brass shotgun shell to hold a shotgun shell together. Reloading brass shotgun shells was widely practiced by self-reliant American farmers during the 1870s, using the same waterglass material that was also used to preserve eggs. The cementing of the top wad on a shotgun shell consisted of applying from three to five drops of waterglass on the top wad to secure it to the brass hull. Brass hulls for shotgun shells were superseded by paper hulls starting around 1877. The newer paper-hulled shotgun shells used a roll crimp in place of a waterglass-cemented joint to hold the top wad in the shell. However, whereas brass shotshells with top wads cemented with waterglass could be reloaded nearly indefinitely (given powder, wad, and shot, of course), the paper hulls that replaced the brass hulls could be reloaded only a few times.

=== Food and medicine ===
Sodium silicate and other silicates are the primary components in &quot;instant&quot; wrinkle remover creams, which temporarily tighten the skin to minimize the appearance of wrinkles and under-eye bags. These creams, when applied as a thin film and allowed to dry for a few minutes, can present dramatic results. This effect is not permanent, lasting from a few minutes up to a couple of hours. It works like water cement, once the muscle starts to move, it cracks and leaves white residues on the skin.

Waterglass has been used as an egg preservative with large success, primarily when refrigeration is not available. Fresh-laid eggs are immersed in a solution of sodium silicate (waterglass). After being immersed in the solution, they are removed and allowed to dry. A permanent air tight coating remains on the eggs. If they are then stored in appropriate environment, the majority of bacteria which would otherwise cause them to spoil are kept out and their moisture is kept in. According to the cited source, treated eggs can be kept fresh using this method for up to five months. When boiling eggs preserved that way, the shell is no longer permeable to air, and the egg will tend to crack unless a hole in the shell is made (e.g., with a pin) in order to allow steam to escape.

Sodium silicate&#x27;s flocculant properties are also used to clarify wine and beer by precipitating colloidal particles. As a clearing agent, though, sodium silicate is sometimes confused with isinglass which is prepared from collagen extracted from the dried swim bladders of sturgeon and other fishes. Eggs can be preserved in a bucket of waterglass gel, and their shells are sometimes also used (baked and crushed) to clear wine.

Sodium silicate gel is also used as a substrate for algal growth in aquaculture hatcheries.

<text>SŽ series 310 is a high-speed tilting EMU used on the InterCitySlovenija premium train service in Slovenia, operated by Slovenske železnice since September 24, 2000. It is based on the Italian ETR 460 commonly known as Pendolino. The train is capable of reaching a maximum speed of 200 km/h. The train is electric single system - 3 kV DC.

InterCitySlovenija links the major cities of Slovenia in one line: Ljubljana, Celje and Maribor, with frequent service that acts as a high-speed shuttle. Tilting trains can reach a maximum speed of 160 km/h on the sections Maribor - Pragersko, Pragersko - Slovenska Bistrica and Grobelno - Sentjur. The train is made up of three cars: two 2nd class cars and one 1st class car. The trains provide disabled access, as well as an onboard Wi-Fi and a snack bar.

Slovenske železnice bought in the year 2000 three trainsets, which currently operate on the Ljubljana - Maribor route.

One SŽ series 310 trainset was also used on international services, connecting Venice Santa Lucia to Ljubljana as Eurocity 50/51 Casanova from December 14, 2003, to April 1, 2008. From December 12, 2004, to December 10, 2005, this service was extended to Maribor, with Intercity connections from and to Graz in Austria.

<doc id="286252" wikidata="Q7719460" url="?curid=286252" title="The Boston Post">
<text>The Boston Post was a daily newspaper in New England for over a hundred years before its final shutdown in 1956. The &quot;Post&quot; was founded in November 1831 by two prominent Boston businessmen, Charles G. Greene and William Beals.

Edwin Grozier bought the paper in 1891. Within two decades, he had built it into easily the largest paper in Boston and New England. Grozier suffered a total physical breakdown in 1920, and turned over day-to-day control of the &quot;Post&quot; to his son, Richard. Upon Edwin&#x27;s death in 1924, Richard inherited the paper. Under the younger Grozier, &quot;The Boston Post&quot; grew into one of the largest newspapers in the country. At its height in the 1930s, it had a circulation of well over a million readers. At the same time, Richard Grozier suffered an emotional breakdown from the death of his wife in childbirth from which he never recovered.

Throughout the 1940s, facing increasing competition from the Hearst-run papers in Boston and New York and from radio and television news, the paper began a decline from which it never recovered.

When it ceased publishing in October 1956, its daily circulation was 230,000.

==Former contributors==
*Olin Downes, music critic.
*Richard Frothingham Jr., a Massachusetts historian, journalist, and politician who was a proprietor and managing editor of &quot;The Boston Post&quot;.
*Frederick E. Goodrich, journalist and political figure who worked for the &quot;Post&quot; for 54 years, including a five years as editor-in-chief.
*Robert F. Kennedy, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator; correspondent for &quot;The Boston Post&quot; in 1948, 1951
*Bernard G Richards
*Kenneth Roberts
*Olga Van Slyke Owens Huckins, literary editor, 1941–1954. Huckins letter to Rachel Carson inspired the book &quot;Silent Spring&quot;.
*Newton Newkirk was hired by the Post in 1901 and produced the &quot;Bingfield Bugleville&quot; comic strip that lent its name to Bing Crosby

==&quot;Sunday Magazine&quot; supplement==

From 1904 through 1916, &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot; was a regular syndicated supplement to Sunday editions of newspapers in various cities across the United States, including &quot;The Boston Post&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot;, &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;St. Louis Republic&quot;, &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, and &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;. The supplement in Boston was initially titled &quot;Sunday Magazine of the Boston Sunday Post&quot;; later, as &quot;Boston Sunday Post Sunday Magazine&quot;. The regular 20-page periodical has a magazine-like format that is essentially identical to the versions that accompanied other major newspapers in the early 1900s, featuring the same cover illustration, articles, short stories, serials, and advertisements.

==Pulitzer Prizes==
*1921 – Meritorious Public Service. &quot;The Boston Post&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer prize for its investigation and exposure of Charles Ponzi&#x27;s financial fraud. Ponzi was first exposed by the investigative work directed by Richard Grozier, then acting publisher, and Edward Dunn, long time city editor, after complaints by Bostonians that the returns Ponzi offered were &quot;too good to be true&quot;. It was the first time that a Boston paper had won a Pulitzer, and was the last Pulitzer for public service awarded to a Boston paper until the &quot;Globe&quot; won it in 2003.

==&quot;Boston Post&quot; Cane tradition==
In 1909, under the ownership of Edwin Grozier, &quot;The Boston Post&quot; engaged in its most famous publicity stunt. The paper had 700 ornate, ebony-shafted, gold-capped canes made and contacted the selectmen in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island towns. The &quot;Boston Post&quot; Canes were given to the selectmen with the request that the canes be presented in a ceremony to the town&#x27;s oldest living man. The custom was expanded to include a community&#x27;s oldest women in 1930. More than 500 towns in New England still carry on the &quot;Boston Post&quot; Cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909.

==Usage==
According to H. W. Fowler, the first recorded instance of the term O. K. was made in the &quot;Boston Morning Post&quot; of 1839.

<text>In a communications network, a drop is the portion of a device directly connected to the internal station facilities, such as toward a telephone switchboard, toward a switching center, or toward a telephone exchange. A drop can also be a wire or cable from a pole or cable terminus to a building, in which case it may be referred to as a downlead. These cables may be reinforced to withstand the tension (due to gravity and weather) of an aerial drop (i.e., hanging in air), as in &quot;messenger&quot; type RG-6 coaxial cable, which is reinforced with a steel messenger wire along its length.

<doc id="286259" wikidata="Q5346469" url="?curid=286259" title="Edwin Grozier">
<text>Edwin Atkins Grozier (September 12, 1859 – May 9, 1924) was an American journalist, publisher and author, who owned &quot;The Boston Post&quot; from 1891 until his death. He authored the book, &quot;The Wreck of the &#x27;Somerset,&#x27;&quot; first published in the &quot;New York World&quot;, May 1886.

He graduated from Boston University in 1881, and worked at both the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. He served as Governor George D. Robinson&#x27;s private secretary, and later as private secretary to Joseph Pulitzer. He later became the first city editor of the &quot;New York Evening World&quot;, and later its editor-in-chief. He took over &quot;The Boston Post&quot; in October 1891.

== Background and Education ==
Grozier was born at sea, as his father&#x27;s ship approached the Golden Gate Bridge, near San Francisco. His father, Joshua Freeman, was a sea captain and native of Provincetown, Massachusetts; his mother, Mary Louise (Given), was a native of Bowdoinham.

He attended high school in Provincetown, and attended Chauncy Hall school of Boston. He studied at Brown University, (1877-1879) in Providence, Rhode Island, and graduated from Boston University in 1881, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy.

Grozier married Alice Goodell, native of Salem, Massachusetts, on November 26, 1885. They had two children, Richard (1837–1946) and Helen (b. 1889).

He was a member of numerous clubs and organizations, including the Algonquin Club of Boston, the Fellowcraft of New York, and the Belfry of Lexington.

== Career ==
Grozier began his career in journalism, as a reporter at the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; from 1881–1883. He then spent a year, serving as Governor George D. Robinson&#x27;s private secretary (1883–1884). Grozier returned to the newsbusiness in 1885, as private secretary to Joseph Pulitzer, and later as city editor of the &quot;New York World&quot;, (1887) and managing editor of &quot;The Evening World&quot; and the &quot;Sunday World&quot; (1889–1891).

In October 1891, Grozier purchased controlling interest in &quot;The Boston Post&quot;, at a time when readership was low, with a circulation of less than 2500; the paper was on the verge of bankruptcy. However, in less than 25-years, Grozier grew the paper into the largest circulation morning newspaper in the country.

=== Advertising and public relations ===

In 1909, Grozier launched a public relations campaign aimed at increasing readership. He purchased 700 walking canes, and sent them out to 700 New England towns where the &quot;Post&quot; was published. The top of the African ebony, gold-tipped canes, were stamped with the words, &quot;Presented by the Boston Post to the oldest resident of ... (name of town).&quot; The Board of Selectmen in each town were to be trustees; ensuring the canes were presented in a ceremony to the town&#x27;s oldest living man. The custom was expanded to include a community&#x27;s oldest women in 1930. More than 500 towns in New England still carry on &quot;The Boston Post&quot; Cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909.

Under his leadership, the &quot;Post&quot; became the leading U.S. newspaper in advertising volume, and advertisers recognized the &quot;Post&quot; as an opportunity for increased exposure. One Philadelphia advertising agency noted that the &quot;Post&quot; was the only paper published in the morning. Zain Advertising, launched a 10-week ad-writing contest with the &quot;Post&quot;, in an effort to engage and educate the public on the importance of advertising. Three hundred prizes were awarded each week for the best advertising suggestions on 24 products. Two grand prizes, $500 and $1000, were awarded at the end of the campaign; over 500-thousand entries were submitted over the 10-week period.

=== Notable reporting ===

==== Richeson murder and execution ====
The New England Historical Society wrote of the coverage of the 1911 murder of Avis Linnell by Clarence Richeson, saying, &#x27;&quot;the crusading newspaper editor of &quot;The Boston Post&quot;, Edwin Grozier, brought him to grief...[putting] his reporters on the story. They found Richeson bought cyanide from a druggist in Newtown, Mass...the &quot;Post&quot; demanded a police investigation into the death of Avis Linnell.&quot;&#x27; Richeson ultimately confessed, and was executed.

==== Charles Ponzi scheme ====
In 1920, under the leadership of his son, Richard Grozier, who had been day-to-day head of the paper since 1920, the &quot;Post&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Meritorious Public Service after exposing Charles Ponzi as a fraud. The newspaper expose covered individuals with political and financial ties to the scheme. Many community members, including authorities, did not believe the allegations, made during the papers investigation, until &quot;the bubble burst,&quot; leaving millions of dollars in public money lost, as a large Trust company failed.

== Death ==

Grozier died at his home on Brattle Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 9, 1924, after having written two editorials that day.

After his death, his son Richard succeeded him as editor and publisher of the &quot;Post&quot;. The city council in Cambridge, Massachusetts, renamed Hawthorne Avenue, to Grozier Road, in honor of his fathers accomplishments.

<text>In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls from clouds due to gravitational pull. The main forms of precipitation include drizzle, rain, Rain and snow mixed (&quot;sleet&quot; in Commonwealth usage), snow, ice pellets, graupel and hail. Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor (reaching 100% relative humidity), so that the water condenses and &quot;precipitates&quot; or falls. Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation; their water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate, so fog and mist do not fall. (Such a non-precipitating combination is a colloid.) Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated with water vapor: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud. Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called showers.

Moisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed by the low temperature into clouds and rain. This process is typically active when freezing rain occurs. A stationary front is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the focus for forcing moist air to rise. Provided there is necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content, the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds, namely nimbostratus and cumulonimbus if significant precipitation is involved. Eventually, the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the Earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects. Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones. Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy. Thundersnow is possible within a cyclone&#x27;s comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating. Most precipitation occurs within the tropics and is caused by convection.

Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle, and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the planet. Approximately of water falls as precipitation each year: over oceans and over land. Given the Earth&#x27;s surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is , but over land it is only . Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes. Global warming is already causing changes to weather, increasing precipitation in some geographies, and reducing it in others, resulting in additional extreme weather.

Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies. Saturn&#x27;s largest satellite, Titan, hosts methane precipitation as a slow-falling drizzle, which has been observed as rain puddles at its equator and polar regions.

==Types==

Mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall. Convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation, while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation. Precipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice. Mixtures of different types of precipitation, including types in different categories, can fall simultaneously. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle. Rain or drizzle that freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass is called &quot;freezing rain&quot; or &quot;freezing drizzle&quot;. Frozen forms of precipitation include snow, ice needles, ice pellets, hail, and graupel.

=== Measurement ===
;Liquid precipitation: Rainfall (including drizzle and rain) is usually measured using a rain gauge and expressed in units of millimeters (mm) of height or depth. Equivalently, it can be expressed as a physical quantity with dimension of volume of water per collection area, in units of liters per square meter (L/m2); as 1L = 1dm3 = 1mm·m2, the units of area (m2) cancel out, resulting in simply &quot;mm&quot;. This also corresponds to an area density expressed in kg/m2, if assuming that 1 liter of water has a mass of 1 kg (water density), which is acceptable for most practical purposes. The corresponding English unit used is usually inches. In Australia before metrication, rainfall was also measured in &quot;points&quot;, each of which was defined as one-hundredth of an inch.

;Solid precipitation: A snow gauge is usually used to measure the amount of solid precipitation. Snowfall is usually measured in centimeters by letting snow fall into a container and then measure the height. The snow can then optionally be melted to obtain a water equivalent measurement in millimeters like for liquid precipitation. The relationship between snow height and water equivalent depends on the water content of the snow; the water equivalent can thus only provide a rough estimate of snow depth. Other forms of solid precipitation, such as snow pellets and hail or even rain and snow mixed (&quot;sleet&quot; in Commonwealth usage), can also be melted and measured as their respective water equivalents, usually expressed in millimeters as for liquid precipitation.

==Air becomes saturated==

===Cooling air to its dew point===
The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel of air must be cooled in order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to water. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. The cloud condensation nuclei concentration will determine the cloud microphysics. An elevated portion of a frontal zone forces broad areas of lift, which form cloud decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.

There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.

===Adding moisture to the air===
The main ways water vapor is added to the air are: wind convergence into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains.

==Forms of precipitation==

===Raindrops===

Coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets, or when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal, which is known as the Bergeron process. The fall rate of very small droplets is negligible, hence clouds do not fall out of the sky; precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops. droplets with different size will have different terminal velocity that cause droplets collision and producing larger droplets, Turbulence will enhance the collision process. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.

Raindrops have sizes ranging from mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Contrary to the cartoon pictures of raindrops, their shape does not resemble a teardrop. Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration. Rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops. The METAR code for rain is RA, while the coding for rain showers is SHRA.

===Ice pellets===
Ice pellets (&quot;sleet&quot; in US usage) are a form of precipitation consisting of small, translucent balls of ice. Ice pellets are usually (but not always) smaller than hailstones. They often bounce when they hit the ground, and generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain. The METAR code for ice pellets is PL.

Ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air exists with sub-freezing air both above and below. This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer. As they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets. However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and freezing rain will be the result at the surface. A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season. 

===Hail===

Like other precipitation, hail forms in storm clouds when supercooled water droplets freeze on contact with condensation nuclei, such as dust or dirt. The storm&#x27;s updraft blows the hailstones to the upper part of the cloud. The updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down, back into the updraft, and are lifted again. Hail has a diameter of or more. Within METAR code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at least . GR is derived from the French word grêle. Smaller-sized hail, as well as snow pellets, use the coding of GS, which is short for the French word grésil. Stones just larger than golf ball-sized are one of the most frequently reported hail sizes. Hailstones can grow to and weigh more than . In large hailstones, latent heat released by further freezing may melt the outer shell of the hailstone. The hailstone then may undergo &#x27;wet growth&#x27;, where the liquid outer shell collects other smaller hailstones. The hailstone gains an ice layer and grows increasingly larger with each ascent. Once a hailstone becomes too heavy to be supported by the storm&#x27;s updraft, it falls from the cloud.

===Snowflakes===
Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets (about 10 μm in diameter) freeze. Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment. Because water droplets are more numerous than the ice crystals the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers in size at the expense of the water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets&#x27; expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Guinness World Records list the world&#x27;s largest snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured wide.

Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles. The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. Rarely, at a temperature of around , snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry—triangular snowflakes. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing. No two snowflakes are alike, as they grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere through which they fall on their way to the ground. The METAR code for snow is SN, while snow showers are coded SHSN.

===Diamond dust===

Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface-based air. They are made of simple ice crystals, hexagonal in shape. The METAR identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is IC.

===Occult deposition===
Occult deposition occurs when mist or air that is highly saturated with water vapour interacts with the leaves of trees or shrubs it passes over.

==Causes==

===Frontal activity===

Stratiform or dynamic precipitation occurs as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as over surface cold fronts, and over and ahead of warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. Precipitation may occur on celestial bodies other than Earth. When it gets cold, Mars has precipitation that most likely takes the form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.

===Convection===

Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g. cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.

===Orographic effects===
Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward (upwind) side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.

In Hawaii, Mount Waiʻaleʻale, on the island of Kauai, is notable for its extreme rainfall, as it has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, with . Storm systems affect the state with heavy rains between October and March. Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (&quot;Koolau&quot;) and leeward (&quot;Kona&quot;) regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains. Windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.

In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina. The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.

===Snow===
Extratropical cyclones can bring cold and dangerous conditions with heavy rain and snow with winds exceeding , (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation that is associated with their warm front is often extensive, forced by weak upward vertical motion of air over the frontal boundary which condenses as it cools and produces precipitation within an elongated band, which is wide and stratiform, meaning falling out of nimbostratus clouds.

Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow bands. Those bands bring strong localized snowfall which can be understood as follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13 °C or 23 °F) between the water surface and the air above. Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds (see satellite picture) which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.

In mountainous areas, heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend the mountains and squeeze out precipitation along their windward slopes, which in cold conditions, falls in the form of snow. Because of the ruggedness of terrain, forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant challenge.

===Within the tropics===

The wet, or rainy, season is the time of year, covering one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term &quot;green season&quot; is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly. Soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.

Tropical cyclones, a source of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern hemisphere) or counterclockwise (northern hemisphere). Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Areas in their path can receive a year&#x27;s worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.

===Large-scale geographical distribution===

On the large scale, the highest precipitation amounts outside topography fall in the tropics, closely tied to the Intertropical Convergence Zone, itself the ascending branch of the Hadley cell. Mountainous locales near the equator in Colombia are amongst the wettest places on Earth. North and south of this are regions of descending air that form subtropical ridges where precipitation is low; the land surface underneath these ridges is usually arid, and these regions make up most of the Earth&#x27;s deserts. An exception to this rule is in Hawaii, where upslope flow due to the trade winds lead to one of the wettest locations on Earth.

==Measurement==
The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in plastic and metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. These gauges are used in the winter by removing the funnel and inner cylinder and allowing snow and freezing rain to collect inside the outer cylinder. Some add anti-freeze to their gauge so they do not have to melt the snow or ice that falls into the gauge. Once the snowfall/ice is finished accumulating, or as is approached, one can either bring it inside to melt, or use lukewarm water to fill the inner cylinder with in order to melt the frozen precipitation in the outer cylinder, keeping track of the warm fluid added, which is subsequently subtracted from the overall total once all the ice/snow is melted.

When a precipitation measurement is made, various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet, such as CoCoRAHS or GLOBE. If a network is not available in the area where one lives, the nearest local weather office will likely be interested in the measurement.

===Hydrometeor definition===
A concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor. Any particulates of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors. Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, haze, fog, and mist, are composed of hydrometeors. All precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground. Particles blown from the Earth&#x27;s surface by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors, as are hail and snow.

===Satellite estimates===
Although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation, there are many areas in which their use is not feasible. This includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas. In other cases, social, technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations. As a result, the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations.

Satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories. Thermal infrared (IR) sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops. Due to the typical structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes. Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds. Various mathematical schemes, or algorithms, use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the IR data.

Additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels, additional IR channels, water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals. However, most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources.

==Return period==

The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration is called the return period or frequency. The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historical data for the location. The term &quot;1 in 10 year storm&quot; describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10 years, so it has a 10 percent likelihood any given year. The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year. The term &quot;1 in 100 year storm&quot; describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century, so has a 1 percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10 year event. As with all probability events, it is possible though unlikely to have two &quot;1 in 100 Year Storms&quot; in a single year.

==Uneven pattern of precipitation==
A significant portion of the annual precipitation in any particular place (no weather station in Africa or South America were considered) falls on only a few days, typically about 50% during the 12 days with the most precipitation.

==Role in Köppen climate classification==


Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between . A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with rainfall between a year. They are widespread on Africa, and are also found in India, the northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and Australia. The humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall (and sometimes snowfall) is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones. Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents, roughly between latitudes 20° and 40° degrees from the equator.

An oceanic (or maritime) climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world&#x27;s continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of western and southern Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.

==Effect on agriculture==

Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on agriculture. All plants need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, cacti require only small amounts of water. 

In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.

==Climate change==

Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more precipitation. Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. In 2018, a study assessing changes in precipitation across spatial scales using a high-resolution global precipitation dataset of over 33+ years, concluded that &quot;While there are regional trends, there is no evidence of increase in precipitation at the global scale in response to the observed global warming.&quot;

Each region of the world is going to have changes in precipitation due to their unique conditions. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation, more evaporation, or both). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1% per century since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6% per century) and the South (11.1%). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25%).

==Changes due to urban heat island==
The urban heat island warms cities above surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between downwind of cities, compared with upwind. Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.

==Forecasting==
The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 GMT. The terrain is considered in QPFs using topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting in the mid to late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States. Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within six to seven hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through the use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.

<text>In an aqueous solution, precipitation is the &quot;sedimentation of a solid material (a precipitate) from a liquid solution&quot;. The solid formed is called the precipitate. In case of an inorganic chemical reaction leading to precipitation, the chemical reagent causing the solid to form is called the precipitant.

The clear liquid remaining above the precipitated or the centrifuged solid phase is also called the supernate or supernatant.

The notion of precipitation can also be extended to other domains of chemistry (organic chemistry and biochemistry) and even be applied to the solid phases (e.g. metallurgy and alloys) when solid impurities segregate from a solid phase.

==Supersaturation==

The precipitation of a compound may occur when its concentration exceeds its solubility. This can be due to temperature changes, solvent evaporation, or by mixing solvents. Precipitation occurs more rapidly from a strongly supersaturated solution.

The formation of a precipitate can be caused by a chemical reaction. When a barium chloride solution reacts with sulphuric acid, a white precipitate of barium sulphate is formed. When a potassium iodide solution reacts with a lead(II) nitrate solution, a yellow precipitate of lead(II) iodide is formed.

==Inorganic chemistry==

Precipitate formation is useful in the detection of the type of cation in a salt. To do this, an alkali first reacts with the unknown salt to produce a precipitate that is the hydroxide of the unknown salt. To identify the cation, the color of the precipitate and its solubility in excess are noted. Similar processes are often used in sequence – for example, a barium nitrate solution will react with sulfate ions to form a solid barium sulfate precipitate, indicating that it is likely that sulfate ions are present.

A common example of precipitation from aqueous solution is that of silver chloride. When silver nitrate (AgNO3) is added to a solution of potassium chloride (KCl) the precipitation of a white solid (AgCl) is observed.

The ionic equation allows to write this reaction by detailing the dissociated ions present in aqueous solution.

===Reductive precipitation===

The Walden reductor is an illustration of a reduction reaction directly accompanied by the precipitation of a less soluble compound because of its lower chemical valence:
The Walden reductor made of tiny silver crystals obtained by the immersion of a copper wire into a solution of silver nitrate is used to reduce to their lower valence any metallic ion located above the silver couple in the redox potential scale.

===Colloidal suspensions===
Without sufficient attraction forces (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Van der Waals force) to aggregate the solid particles together and to remove them from solution by gravity (settling), they remain in suspension and form colloids. Sedimentation can be accelerated by high speed centrifugation. The compact mass thus obtained is sometimes referred to as a &#x27;pellet&#x27;.

===Digestion and precipitates ageing===
Digestion, or &quot;precipitate ageing&quot;, happens when a freshly formed precipitate is left, usually at a higher temperature, in the solution from which it precipitates. It results in purer and larger recrystallized particles. The physico-chemical process underlying digestion is called Ostwald ripening.

==Organic chemistry==

While precipitation reactions can be used for making pigments, removing ions from solution in water treatment, and in classical qualitative inorganic analysis, precipitation is also commonly used to isolate the products of an organic reaction during workup and purification operations. Ideally, the product of the reaction is insoluble in the solvent used for the reaction. Thus, it precipitates as it is formed, preferably forming pure crystals. An example of this would be the synthesis of porphyrins in refluxing propionic acid. By cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, crystals of the porphyrin precipitate, and are collected by filtration on a Büchner filter as illustrated by the photograph here beside:

Precipitation may also occur when an &quot;antisolvent&quot; (a solvent in which the product is insoluble) is added, drastically reducing the solubility of the desired product. Thereafter, the precipitate may be easily separated by decanting, filtration, or by centrifugation. An example would be the synthesis of Cr3+tetraphenylporphyrin chloride: water is added to the dimethylformamide (DMF) solution in which the reaction occurred, and the product precipitates. Precipitation is useful in purifying many other products: &quot;e.g.&quot;, crude bmim-Cl is taken up in acetonitrile, and dropped into ethyl acetate, where it precipitates.

==Biochemistry==
Proteins purification and separation can be performed by precipitation in changing the nature of the solvent or the value of its relative permittivity (&quot;e.g.&quot;, by replacing water by ethanol), or by increasing the ionic strength of the solution. As proteins have complex tertiary and quaternary structures due to their specific folding and various weak intermolecular interactions (&quot;e.g.&quot;, hydrogen bridges), these superstructures can be modified and proteins denaturated and precipitated. Another important application of an antisolvent is in ethanol precipitation of DNA.

==Metallurgy and alloys==
In solid phases, precipitation occurs if the concentration of one solid is above the solubility limit in the host solid, due to e.g. rapid quenching or
ion implantation, and the temperature is high enough that diffusion can lead to segregation into precipitates. Precipitation in solids is routinely used to synthesize nanoclusters.

In metallurgy, precipitation from a solid solution is also a way to strengthen alloys.

Precipitation of ceramic phases in metallic alloys such as zirconium hydrides in zircaloy cladding of nuclear fuel pins can also render metallic alloys brittle and lead to their mechanical failure. Correctly mastering the precise temperature and pressure conditions when cooling down spent nuclear fuels is therefore essential to avoid damaging their cladding and to preserve the integrity of the spent fuel elements on the long term in dry storage casks and in geological disposal conditions.

==Industrial processes==
Hydroxide precipitation is probably the most widely used industrial precipitation process in which metal hydroxides are formed by adding calcium hydroxide (&quot;slaked lime&quot;) or sodium hydroxide (&quot;caustic&quot; &quot;soda&quot;) as precipitant.

==History==
Powders derived from different precipitation processes have also historically been known as &#x27;flowers&#x27;.
