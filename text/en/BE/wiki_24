<text>Orexin (), also known as hypocretin, is a neuropeptide that regulates arousal, wakefulness, and appetite. It exists in the forms of orexin-A and orexin-B. The most common form of narcolepsy, type 1, in which the individual experiences brief losses of muscle tone (&quot;drop attacks&quot; or cataplexy), is caused by a lack of orexin in the brain due to destruction of the cells that produce it. 

There are 50,000–80,000 orexin-producing neurons in the human brain, located predominantly in the perifornical area and lateral hypothalamus. They project widely throughout the central nervous system, regulating wakefulness, feeding, and other behaviours. There are two types of orexin peptide and two types of orexin receptor.

Orexin was discovered in 1998 almost simultaneously by two independent groups of researchers working on the rat brain. One group named it orexin, from &quot;orexis,&quot; meaning &quot;appetite&quot; in Greek; the other group named it hypocretin, because it is produced in the &quot;hypo&quot;thalamus and bears a weak resemblance to &quot;secretin&quot;, another peptide. Officially, &quot;hypocretin&quot; (&quot;HCRT&quot;) is used to refer to the genes and transcripts, while &quot;orexin&quot; is used to refer to the encoded peptides. There is considerable similarity between the orexin system in the rat brain and that in the human brain.

== Discovery ==
In 1998, reports of the discovery of orexin/hypocretin were published nearly simultaneously. Luis de Lecea, Thomas Kilduff, and colleagues reported the discovery of the hypocretin system at the same time as Takeshi Sakurai from Masashi Yanagisawa&#x27;s lab at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas reported the discovery of the &quot;orexins&quot; to reflect the orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) activity of these peptides. In their 1998 paper describing these neuropeptides, they also reported discovery of two orexin receptors, dubbed Orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R or OX1) and Orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R or OX2). Masashi Yanagisawa and Emmanuel Mignot were awarded the Breakthrough Prize in 2022 for this discovery.

The two groups also took different approaches towards their discovery. One team was interested in finding new genes that were expressed in the hypothalamus. In 1996, scientists from the Scripps Research Institute reported the discovery of several genes in the rat brain, including one they dubbed &quot;clone 35.&quot; Their work showed that clone 35 expression was limited to the lateral hypothalamus. They extracted selective DNA found in the lateral hypothalamus. They cloned this DNA and studied it using electron microscopy. Neurotransmitters found in this area were oddly similar to the gut hormone, secretin, a member of the incretin family, so they named hypocretin to stand for a hypothalamic member of the incretin family. These cells were first thought to reside and work only within the lateral hypothalamus area, but immunocytochemistry techniques revealed the various projections this area truly had to other parts of the brain. A majority of these projections reached the limbic system and structures associated with it (including the amygdala, septum, and basal forebrain area).

On the other hand, Sakurai and colleagues were studying the orexin system as orphan receptors. To this end, they used transgenic cell lines that expressed individual orphan receptors and then exposed them to different potential ligands. They found that the orexin peptides activated the cells expressing the orexin receptors and went on to find orexin peptide expression specifically in the hypothalamus. Additionally, when either orexin peptide was administered to rats it stimulated feeding, giving rise to the name &#x27;orexin&#x27;.

The nomenclature of the orexin/hypocretin system now recognizes the history of its discovery. &quot;Hypocretin&quot; refers to the gene or genetic products and &quot;orexin&quot; refers to the protein, reflecting the differing approaches that resulted in its discovery. The use of both terms is also a practical necessity because &quot;HCRT&quot; is the standard gene symbol in databases like GenBank and &quot;OX&quot; is used to refer to the pharmacology of the peptide system by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.

== Isoforms ==
There are two types of orexin: orexin-A and orexin-B (hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2). They are excitatory neuropeptides with approximately 50% sequence identity, produced by cleavage of a single precursor protein. This precursor protein is known as prepro-orexin (or preprohypocretin) and is a 130 amino acid pre-pro-peptide encoded by the gene &quot;HRCT&quot; and located on chromosome 17 (17q21). Orexin-A is 33 amino acid residues long and has two intrachain disulfide bonds; orexin-B is a linear 28 amino acid residue peptide. Although these peptides are produced by a very small population of cells in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus, they send projections throughout the brain. The orexin peptides bind to the two G-protein coupled orexin receptors, OX1 and OX2, with orexin-A binding to both OX1 and OX2 with approximately equal affinity while orexin-B binds mainly to OX2 and is 5 times less potent at OX1.

The orexins are strongly conserved peptides, found in all major classes of vertebrates.

== Function ==

The orexin system was initially suggested to be primarily involved in the stimulation of food intake, based on the finding that central administration of orexin-A and -B increased food intake. In addition, it stimulates wakefulness, regulates energy expenditure, and modulates visceral function. The orexin system has been hypothesized to function by exciting other neurons that produce neurotransmitters (such as the locus coeruleus), as well as by inhibiting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, which is a region of the brain whose neuronal activity is imperative to proper sleep function.

=== Brown fat activation ===
Many studies support that the orexin neurons regulate brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity via the sympathetic nervous system to enhance energy expenditure.
Although orexin knockout mice were reported to show maldevelopment of brown adipose tissue (BAT), subsequent report has shown normal development of BAT.

=== Wakefulness ===
Orexin seems to promote wakefulness. Studies indicate that a major role of the orexin system is to integrate metabolic, circadian and sleep debt influences to determine whether an animal should be asleep, or awake and active. Orexin neurons strongly excite various brain nuclei with important roles in wakefulness including the dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine and acetylcholine systems and appear to play an important role in stabilizing wakefulness and sleep.

The discovery that an orexin receptor mutation causes the sleep disorder canine narcolepsy in Doberman Pinschers subsequently indicated a major role for this system in sleep regulation. Genetic knockout mice lacking the gene for orexin were also reported to exhibit narcolepsy. Transitioning frequently and rapidly between sleep and wakefulness, these mice display many of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Researchers are using this animal model of narcolepsy to study the disease. Narcolepsy results in excessive daytime sleepiness, inability to consolidate wakefulness in the day (and sleep at night), and cataplexy, which is the loss of muscle tone in response to strong, usually positive, emotions. Dogs that lack a functional receptor for orexin have narcolepsy, while animals and people lacking the orexin neuropeptide itself also have narcolepsy. Organisms with narcolepsy were also found to experience REM sleep at any time of day, suggesting an alteration of function of REM sleep which can lead to hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur as an organism goes to sleep).

Central administration of orexin-A strongly promotes wakefulness, increases body temperature and locomotion, and elicits a strong increase in energy expenditure. Sleep deprivation also increases orexin-A transmission. The orexin system may thus be more important in the regulation of energy expenditure than in the regulation of food intake. In fact, orexin-deficient people with narcolepsy have increased obesity rather than decreased BMI, as would be expected if orexin were primarily an appetite stimulating peptide. Another indication that deficits of orexin cause narcolepsy is that depriving monkeys of sleep for 30–36 hours and then injecting them with the neurochemical alleviates the cognitive deficiencies normally seen with such amount of sleep loss.

In humans, narcolepsy is associated with a specific variant of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis shows that, in addition to the HLA variant, people with narcolepsy also exhibit a specific genetic mutation in the T-cell receptor alpha locus. In conjunction, these genetic anomalies cause the immune system to attack and kill the critical orexin neurons. Hence the absence of orexin-producing neurons in people with narcolepsy may be the result of an autoimmune disorder.

=== Food intake ===
Orexin increases the craving for food, and correlates with the function of the substances that promote its production. Orexin is also shown to increase meal size by suppressing inhibitory postingestive feedback. However, some studies suggest that the stimulatory effects of orexin on feeding may be due to general arousal without necessarily increasing overall food intake.

Review findings suggest that hyperglycemia that occurs in mice due to a habitual high-fat diet leads to a reduction in signalling by orexin receptor-2, and that orexin receptors may be a future therapeutic target. Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells and acts as a long-term internal measure of energy state. Ghrelin is a short-term factor secreted by the stomach just before an expected meal, and strongly promotes food intake. Orexin-producing cells have been shown to be inhibited by leptin (through the leptin receptor pathway), but are activated by ghrelin and hypoglycemia (glucose inhibits orexin production). Orexin, as of 2007, is claimed to be a very important link between metabolism and sleep regulation. Such a relationship has been long suspected, based on the observation that long-term sleep deprivation in rodents dramatically increases food intake and energy metabolism, i.e., catabolism, with lethal consequences on a long-term basis. Sleep deprivation then leads to a lack of energy. In order to make up for this lack of energy, many people use high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods that ultimately can lead to poor health and weight gain. Other dietary nutrients, amino acids, also can activate orexin neurons, and they can suppress the glucose response of orexin neurons at physiological concentration, causing the energy balance that orexin maintains to be thrown off its normal cycle.

=== Addiction ===
Preliminary research shows potential for orexin blockers in the treatment of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol addiction. For example, lab rats given drugs which targeted the orexin system lost interest in alcohol despite being given free access in experiments. Wild type mice that were treated with morphine were found to be at a higher risk of developing addiction when compared to mice that did not produce orexin.

Studies of orexin involvement in nicotine addiction have had mixed results. For example, blocking the orexin-1 receptor with the selective orexin antagonist SB-334,867 reduced nicotine self-administration in rats and that smokers who sustained damage to the insula, a brain region that regulates cravings and contains orexin-1 receptors, lost the desire to smoke. However, other studies in rats using the dual orexin receptor antagonist TCS 1102 have not found similar effects.

=== Lipid metabolism ===
Orexin-A (OXA) has been demonstrated to have a direct effect on an aspect of lipid metabolism. OXA stimulates glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that increased energy uptake is stored as lipids (triacylglycerol). OXA thus increases lipogenesis. It also inhibits lipolysis and stimulates the secretion of adiponectin. These effects are thought to be mostly conferred via the PI3K pathway because this pathway inhibitor (LY294002) completely blocks OXA effects in adipocytes. The link between OXA and lipid metabolism is currently being studied.

=== Mood ===
High levels of orexin-A have been associated with happiness in human subjects, while low levels have been associated with sadness. The finding suggests that boosting levels of orexin-A could elevate mood in humans, being thus a possible future treatment for disorders like depression. Orexins have also been hypothesized to aid in the development of resilience to the stress response, as their activity in the ventral pallidum was found to decrease depressive symptoms by activating GABAergic neurons at that site.

It has been observed that orexin, while implicated in addiction and depression, is also involved in the display of anhedonia in ADHD. Proper functioning of orexin has been shown to have a large degree of control over behaviors that are motivated by a need to survive, such as searching for food when an organism is starving. When orexin does not function as intended, it impairs an organism&#x27;s ability to feel pleasure from strongly motivated actions.

== Orexin neurons ==
===Neurotransmitters===
Orexinergic neurons have been shown to be sensitive to inputs from Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 and receptor heterodimers, adenosine A1 receptors, muscarinic M3 receptors, serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, neuropeptide Y receptors, cholecystokinin A receptors, and catecholamines, as well as to ghrelin, leptin, and glucose. Orexinergic neurons themselves regulate release of acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline.

Orexinergic neurons can be differentiated into two groups based on connectivity and functionality. Orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic group are closely associated with reward related functions, such as conditioned place preference. These neurons preferentially innervate the ventral tegmental area and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The neurons found in the ventral tegmental area, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the nucleus accumbens shell are strongly implicated in addiction and the sensitization of neurons to stimulating drugs (such as amphetamines). Orexin producing neurons in these areas have been found to be primarily indicated in seeking behavior when externally stimulated by environmental signals such as stress. These neurons are in contrast to the lateral hypothalamic neurons, the perifornical-dorsal group of orexinergic neurons are involved in functions related to arousal and autonomic response. These neurons project inter-hypothalamically, as well as to the brainstem, where the release of orexin modulates various autonomic processes.

== Orexin system dysfunction ==
Orexin/hypocretin system dysfunction might be associated with a variety of disorders and medical conditions.
=== Takotsubo syndrome ===
Orexin/hypocretin system dysfunction has been proposed as a novel pathophysiological model of Takotsubo syndrome (acute failure syndrome).

=== ESSENCE ===
ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations) is an umbrella term covering a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders and difficulties (ADHD, developmental coordination disorder, autism spectrum disorder) as well as ESSENCE-associated conditions (behavioural phenotype syndromes, some neurological conditions and disorders, and severe early-onset mental disorders). Orexin/hypocretin system dysfunction might be associated with many symptoms in a variety of ESSENCE.

== Clinical uses ==

The orexin/hypocretin system is the target of the insomnia medication suvorexant (Belsomra), which works by blocking both orexin receptors. Suvorexant has undergone three phase III trials and was approved in 2014 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after being denied approval the year before. The other FDA-approved orexin antagonists are lemborexant (Dayvigo) and daridorexant (Quviviq).

In 2016, the University of Texas Health Science Center registered a clinical trial for the use of suvorexant for people with cocaine dependence. They plan to measure cue reactivity, anxiety and stress.

In 2022, the European Medicines Agency authorized the use of daridorexant (Quviviq) for sleep initiation and maintenance disorders.

=== Other potential uses ===

Intranasal orexin is able to increase cognition in primates, especially under sleep deprived situations, which may provide an opportunity for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness.

A study has reported that transplantation of orexin neurons into the pontine reticular formation in rats is feasible, indicating the development of alternative therapeutic strategies in addition to pharmacological interventions to treat narcolepsy.

Orexins are also thought to have potential implications in learning and aiding in fending off diseases such as dementia and other disorders that impair cognition.

== Evolution ==

The exon architecture of orexin is conserved in all vertebrates.

<text>Zellers was a Canadian discount store chain founded by Walter P. Zeller in 1931. It was acquired by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) in 1978, and after a series of acquisitions and expansions, peaked with 350 locations in 1999. However, fierce competition and an inability to adapt during the early stages of the retail apocalypse resulted in Zellers losing significant ground in the 2000s.

In January 2011, HBC announced that it would sell the lease agreements for up to 220 Zellers stores to the US chain Target for $1.825 billion. In turn, Target announced its intention to convert many of them to Canadian locations of Target, and re-sell the remainder to other parties such as Walmart Canada, resulting in their liquidation and eventual closure. While HBC initially retained 64 Zellers locations, it announced on July 26, 2012, that all of them would be liquidated and closed by March 31, 2013, due to their lack of profitability. Ultimately, all but three selected stores were closed later in 2013.

When the chain ceased, HBC converted the three Zellers-branded locations into liquidation outlets for The Bay (since renamed Hudson&#x27;s Bay), with the last of those stores closing and ending the brand on January 26, 2020. As of 2023 however, the Zellers brand name has been formally reintroduced as a store-within-a-store concept inside Hudson&#x27;s Bay department stores, complemented by online shopping.

==History==
On Saturday, August 4, 1928, Zellers Ltd. was first established in London, Ontario. Walter P. Zeller, its founder, opened his new store and head office at 176 Dundas Street in London after working for years for Metropolitan Stores, F. W. Woolworth Company and Kresge&#x27;s. The plan at the start was to have stores opened in London, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Fort William (part of modern-day Thunder Bay) and Saint John, New Brunswick as part of an effort to establish a Canada-wide chain of department stores. The London store had a street frontage of and a depth of . It had a total of of space on the ground floor with of counter space spread out around the store. Sixty women were hired for the opening day working in 21 different departments. Within months, Zellers was doing such good business that they were bought out by the American firm Schulte-United Ltd, but within two years, the rebranded stores went bankrupt.

===1930s–1960s: Early years, partnership with W.T. Grant===

Zeller promptly bought fourteen Canadian locations of the failed Schulte-United chain, all in Southern Ontario, and relaunched Zellers in late 1931 as a store for thrifty Canadians. One of the locations was the original Zellers at 176 Dundas Street in London, which would remain operating until the late 1980s. Almost immediately, Zellers initiated an aggressive expansion strategy. Within 25 years, Zellers operated 60 stores and employed 3,000 people. In 1952, in a move to expand into Atlantic Canada, it acquired the Federal Stores chain of variety stores, adding more than 12 new Zellers locations.

During this period of expansion, Zellers concluded a deal with W. T. Grant, a similar chain of American mass merchandise department stores. This arrangement allowed W.T. Grant to purchase 10 percent of Zellers shares and eventually a 51 percent ownership in 1959. In exchange, the Grant Company made available to Zellers its experience in merchandising, real estate, store development, and general administration. Zellers employees were sent to Grant stores and head office for training and the two companies made common buying trips to East Asia. In the 1950s, the chain again began opening new locations and in 1956, opened its first self-serve location at the Norgate Shopping Centre in Saint-Laurent, Quebec. Stores opened in 1960 employed many new innovations, including the first in-store restaurant, the first automotive centre and the first suburban location.

===1970s–1980s: Acquisitions of Field and by HBC===
In 1975, Zellers changed its logo to the one it would keep for its remaining 45 years. By 1976, Zellers had grown to a chain of 155 stores, with annual sales of $407 million.

Although Zellers was prospering, W.T. Grant was facing intense competition in the United States from Kmart, Target, and Walmart, and W.T. Grant was forced to withdraw entirely from its Canadian operations. In 1976, Fields, a clothing retailer based in Vancouver, British Columbia, offered to purchase a 50.1 percent stake in Zellers for $32,675,000. Zellers&#x27; shareholders, unhappy with the idea of Zellers becoming a subsidiary of Fields, reversed the takeover and purchased Fields and its hardware store division, Marshall Wells. This sale added 70 Fields stores and 162 franchised Marshall Wells stores to the company. Fields president and founder, Joseph Segal was appointed as president of Zellers.

In June 1978, Zellers presented a bid to acquire 100 percent ownership of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). HBC management, recognizing Zellers profitability and the potential to enter a new retail segment, decided to purchase Zellers instead. Zellers and Fields, operating in very different retail segments from HBC, were kept intact and established as separate divisions of the company. HBC acquired full ownership of Zellers and Fields in 1981 and Marshall Wells in 1982. By 1985, HBC had sold Marshall Wells for $20 million because it was not relevant to its department store business.

Counterfeit video games for the Atari 2600 console were manufactured in Taiwan and sold by Zellers in the early 1980s, usually under new names and artwork and occasionally with modified graphics. All games were pirated copies of titles created either by Atari itself or by third-party developers, such as Activision. Zellers was eventually forced by Atari to stop selling these games as Zellers infringed on Atari&#x27;s copyright. Zellers released 18 games for the Atari 2600 in the early 1980s.

===1990s: Further acquisitions===
In 1990, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company acquired the 51 stores of the Towers/Bonimart chain from the Oshawa Group, and converted most of them to Zellers outlets, including its flagship location in the Scarborough district of Toronto. Zellers advertisements at the time featured both the Towers mascot, Sparky, and the Zellers mascot, Zeddy, walking arm in arm, to show the acquisition to the public. During this period, Zellers used the slogan &quot;Where the lowest price is the law.&quot;

In 1993, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company purchased the assets of the bankrupt Woodward&#x27;s chain, including 21 store locations. These were converted into Zellers and The Bay stores and greatly expanded the company&#x27;s presence in Western Canada. In 1998, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company acquired Kmart&#x27;s Canadian division, and merged it with the Zellers division to create a larger combined chain under the Zellers name. While some Kmart locations were closed, many sites became full Zellers outlets. Kmart Canada president George Heller remained with HBC, eventually becoming HBC&#x27;s president and CEO in the mid-2000s.

In 1996, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company closed its Zellers head office in Montreal, Quebec and merged it with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company headquarters in downtown Toronto. By 1998, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company reestablished its Zellers head office at the former Kmart Canada head office in Brampton, Ontario.

===2000s: Decline===
In Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s last year as a publicly traded company, Zellers had 291 stores and lost $107 million on sales of $4.2 billion. On February 28, 2006, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was taken private by South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker.

Following Zucker&#x27;s death in 2008, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and its subsidiaries including Zellers came under the ownership of a New York-based private equity firm, NRDC Equity Partners, which was headed by Richard Baker. NRDC also owned the Lord &amp; Taylor upscale specialty retail department store chain in the United States.

Subsequently, NRDC invested heavily in The Bay and managed a turnaround by repositioning it as an upscale, fashion-forward retailer. However, the Zellers chain was still struggling and was seen as a drag on the parent company and its American owner. Mark Foote was appointed President and CEO of Zellers in 2008, having recently served as president and chief merchandising officer at Loblaw Companies and prior to that was president of Canadian Tire Corp.&#x27;s retail division. Foote was credited with stabilizing the chain, though it still continued losing ground against Walmart Canada.

===2011–2013: Lease acquisitions by Target, liquidation and closures===

On January 13, 2011, it was announced that US. retail chain Target Corporation would purchase the lease agreements of up to 220 Zellers stores for $1.825 billion. Under the agreement, Zellers would sublease the properties and continue to operate them as Zellers locations until January 2012 at the earliest, and at the latest the end of March 2013. At the time of this announcement, Zellers operated 273 stores, well below the 350 stores it had in 1999.

Upon the announcement, it was reported that once the Zellers stores at these locations were closed, Target would renovate 100 to 150 of them to reopen the stores under the Target banner during 2013 and 2014. The remaining acquired sites would be transferred to other retailers. HBC had said that it would continue to operate the remaining Zellers stores as a smaller chain in specific communities.

Of the maximum 220 locations, 105 to be transferred to Target were identified in late May 2011, and another lot of 84 locations in late September 2011, bringing the total number of Zellers stores acquired by Target to 189. Of these 189 stores, 39 were resold to Walmart Canada.

RioCan REIT was significantly affected, as many of its mall properties include Zellers locations. In addition, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union planned to hold demonstrations as many Zellers staffers were to be laid off instead of being retained by Target or Walmart. This was in marked contrast to the takeover of Woolco by Walmart in 1994, where all Woolco employees of the acquired stores were retained.

The President and CEO of Zellers, Mark Foote, had a mandate to liquidate the 273 Zellers stores in preparing it for Target&#x27;s takeover by October 2011. Foote&#x27;s strategy was to use a blueprint of a retail liquidation, but without the typical insolvency and desperation that plagued failing chains. Foote focused on raising profits, even if that meant losing market share and reducing store traffic, by ramping up inventory levels of higher margin goods over loss leaders such as apparel over deeply discounted paper towels and detergent, and by slashing costs. Foote also replaced the expensive fall television advertising campaign with a social media blitz on Facebook. Reportedly, the strategy was paying off as Zellers operating profit was &quot;well ahead of expectations and the retailer had performed very well in 2011.

In March 2012, the first 50 Zellers stores were put in liquidation. This included all 39 Zellers stores slated to become Walmart outlets. By mid-June, the latter locations were closed to the public. On June 25, 2012, 17 more stores in Ontario were put in liquidation.

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company announced on July 26, 2012, that it would close most of the 64 remaining stores that were supposed to continue operating as Zellers outlets. A company spokesperson stated that these stores employ 6,400 people, or approximately 100 per location, range in size from 48,000 to 128,000 square feet and are mostly in small towns. The closings of these stores were to happen at the latest on March 31, 2013 which coincided with the deadline date the HBC had to vacate the sites acquired by Target. The HBC&#x27;s main reason for closing the 64 remaining stores was due to Zellers lack of profitability. The HBC also remarked that it would not be viable to keep Zellers as an ongoing chain due to the geographical locations of the remaining 64 stores. The HBC did not exclude the possibility of keeping some stores open and converting them as The Bay or Home Outfitters outlets.

After the deal with Target Corporation, HBC still had a burden in half of the $226.4 million of Zellers lease obligations remaining through 2016, with the rent for 2012 alone being almost half of HBC&#x27;s adjusted profit. With HBC preparing an initial public offering in late 2012, it either terminated these liabilities with landlords at steep discounts or found new tenants to sublet the space.

After HBC decided not to continue Zellers with the remaining 64 stores, these locations started their liquidation sale on December 26, 2012 and the company stopped accepting returns on January 31, 2013. Liquidators sold nearly all of Zellers merchandise, store fixtures and shopping carts at discounted prices.

===2013–2020: Liquidator ===
In January 2013, HBC revised its strategy and decided to keep a total of three stores open under the Zellers banner after March 31, 2013. These locations no longer operated as discount department stores, but instead as liquidation outlets for sister chain The Bay. HBC communications manager Tiffany Bourré described these locations as featuring fashion apparel and a refined home product offering with more from other HBC banners.

Originally, these included the store at Place Bourassa in Montreal North, Quebec, but it closed in early 2014. Replacing it was a previously closed Zellers in the Ottawa community of Nepean, which reopened on April 3, 2014, keeping the number of stores at three. In September 2014, the last Zellers in Western Canada, at Semiahmoo Shopping Centre in Surrey, British Columbia, was closed, leaving only two stores remaining nationwide: at Kipling Queensway Mall in Etobicoke, Ontario, and Bells Corners in Nepean, Ontario. Both locations were closed by January 26, 2020.

=== 2023: Hudson&#x27;s Bay store-within-a-store relaunch ===

In September 2021, as a pilot project, HBC relaunched the Zellers brand as a pop-up shop within a Hudson&#x27;s Bay department store at the Burlington Centre mall in Ontario. Essentially a store-within-a-store concept, it sported hanging Zellers logo banners, the classic red-and-white painted walls colour scheme, and red floor lines to mark off one small section within the Hudsons Bay store. While offering a limited selection of goods, including Canada-branded apparel, bedding, housewares and toys, it mainly was intended to invoke a &quot;fun and nostalgic experience&quot; according to HBC. At the time, HBC stated more Hudson&#x27;s Bay locations may use the concept in the future.

Subsequent reporting by trade publication &quot;Retail Insider&quot; indicated the pop-up location may have been prompted by trademark filings by an unrelated group that had opened two stores under the Zellers (as well as Kmart Canada) brands, after HBC allowed a trademark on the Zellers logo to expire in 2020; HBC is suing the group to prevent what it alleges to be unauthorized use of a brand that it still controls. Some retail analysts believe the re-introduction of Zellers is primarily due to HBC&#x27;s lawsuit over protection of its trademark, using this as a demonstration of ownership of the brand, and doubts any successful expansion or revitalization of the former chain.

In March 2023, HBC formally brought back the Zellers brand as an e-commerce website and physical space within 12 select Hudson&#x27;s Bay stores in Ontario and Alberta. , there were 25 Hudson&#x27;s Bay stores across Canada with a Zellers-themed section. After another wave of openings in August, it was announced in September 2023 that the totality of Hudson&#x27;s Bay locations will have Zellers spaces by the end of the month. The Zellers shops range in size from , with the first 25 locations being typically larger than the ones that opened later in the year.

==Stores==
Zellers operated stores from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, to Victoria, British Columbia and employed over 35,000 people. The average store size was 94,000 square feet (8,700 m2). Zellers Select stores were designed for smaller markets with populations under 25,000, with stores averaged 45,000 square feet (4,200 m2). Some multi-level stores were equipped with a shopping cart system known as the Cartveyor, designed to transport shopping carts between floors next to a standard escalator, while there were few that were so small, they were also equipped with elevators open to shoppers, such as with the Lawrence Square Shopping Centre (later renamed Lawrence Allen Centre in 2019) location in the North York district of Toronto; this location had two levels.

In July 2010, Zellers unveiled prototype store designs in five Winnipeg locations, with two more originally planned for late 2010 and early 2011. One store opened on the lower floor of the downtown Winnipeg Bay store, making it a Bay-Zellers hybrid location.

===Restaurant===
The Skillet, Zellers in-store restaurant brand, launched in 1960. The restaurants underwent several revisions and were branded as Zellers Family Restaurant before their demise. In spring 2023, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company brought the restaurant back as a food truck at select locations.

===Liquidation centres===
The Zellers chain had also operated a few liquidation centres for its own merchandise. Those were typically former regular Zellers stores that had been converted as liquidation centres for a limited time before closing down for good. The Zellers Family restaurants continued operating in these liquidation centres.

When the remaining 64 stores of the chain were closed on March 31, 2013, three locations were converted to serve as store liquidator for Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Home Outfitters.

==Products==
Products sold at Zellers included clothing, groceries, stationery, toys, electronics, furniture, and home supplies.

===Grocery===
All Zellers sold basic groceries such as dry snacks and other prepackaged foods. The Neighbourhood Market, formerly available at some locations, was Zellers&#x27; expanded section of grocery items, which included frozen and dairy aisles. Prototype stores in Winnipeg featured full grocery departments including fresh produce and baked goods. Such plans were dropped following Target Canada&#x27;s acquisition of many Zellers leases. Some stores removed their The Neighbourhood Market section and expanded the other sections.

===Exclusive labels===
Zellers carried many of its own labels and also had exclusive rights in Canada to some other labels:

When Zellers relaunched as a pop-up store in 2023, they announced a new exclusive label, Anko, an Australian company. Its products are available online and at physical Zellers stores, as well as in Australian Kmart stores. The Zellers pop-up stores contain mostly products by Anko and in-house brands.

====Acquired labels====
Some labels exclusive to Target Corporation in the United States were previously exclusive to Zellers in Canada. After Target&#x27;s acquisition of Zellers leases until its closure, Target Canada became the exclusive store for the following brands:
*Cherokee
*Mossimo
*Wabasso

However, Target Canada closed in 2015, leaving Wabasso, and Mossimo unavailable in Canada since then. Cherokee was then carried by Sears Canada for a short period, until it too closed in January 2018. With the demise of Zellers, Target Canada and Sears Canada, these brands are no longer carried in Canada.

==Customer service==
On January 6, 2012, CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Marketplace&quot; announced that Zellers received the title of Canada&#x27;s Worst Customer Service as a department store, based on a survey conducted by CBC with the Léger Marketing research firm in eight metropolitan areas. The retailer refused to be interviewed by &quot;Marketplace&quot; host Erica Johnson regarding its ranking, providing her with a written statement instead. Zellers also did not offer a refund to the mystery shopper who bought a used coffeemaker that was presented as new, and attempted to return the product after the advertised 30-day return period. Zellers Customer Service did not respond to this customer&#x27;s Twitter message seeking satisfactory resolution.

==Advertising==
Zellers ran a Festive Finale advertising campaign in late 2011. Zeddy was also used as a mascot to advertise the retailer&#x27;s toy selection.

===Festive Finale===
The Festive Finale campaign was used to advertise Zellers last Christmas and holiday season sale in December 2011. There was a website called Zellers Facebook.ca which allowed customers to vote for their favourite coupon and musical genre. While Zellers recommended that customers have a Facebook account and Like the company, both of these steps were optional. It was also possible to record a radio commercial for Zellers Moonlight Madness sale by using a computer microphone and reading the site&#x27;s teleprompter. Zellers also had social networking service accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Festive Finale was criticized for its Boxing Week coupon.

===Loyalty program===
As a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company subsidiary, Zellers promoted the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Rewards program also available at Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Home Outfitters. It had been known as Club Z and HBC Rewards. The program used a points card, available at no charge but only accepted by Zellers and other partners. A Hudson&#x27;s Bay MasterCard issued by Capital One is also available, which rewards customers with one point per dollar spent on the card at any retailer. Any Zellers cashier failing to inform a customer about the HBC MasterCard had to give that customer 10,000 HBC points. This is equivalent to 250 Hudson&#x27;s Bay points, or one eighth of the requirement for a $10 gift card. Hudson&#x27;s Bay points can still be redeemed for Hudson&#x27;s Bay gift cards.

===Slogans===
Numerous slogans were used by Zellers:
* Early 1980s: The low prices of Zellers are in the news (Zellers low prices are making headlines)
* 1980s: Only you&#x27;ll know how little you paid
* 1980s: Shopping anywhere else is pointless
* Late 1980s and 1990s: Where the lowest price is the law!, followed by Where the lowest price is the law...everyday! and Because the lowest price is the law.
* 1990s: Truly Canadian
* 1997–2000: Better and Better
* 2000–2013: Everything from A to Z
===Zeddy===

Zeddy is a teddy bear mascot used by Zellers all over Canada. He was first used in 1986 as an advertising campaign, and then rose to his popularity by the early 1990s. The main purpose of Zeddy was to advertise Toyland, the toy section in Zellers stores. Zellers provided a stuffed Zeddy bear for any child who had a birthday party sponsored by Zellers. There was also a Zellers employee in a giant Zeddy costume hosting the party. Lineup toys of Zeddy were also created. In the final months before the last of the Zellers stores were closed permanently, the company distributed large batches of stuffed Zeddy Bears for sale in stores throughout the network.

Many stores feature a Zeddy Wheel ride, which accommodates one young child on a miniature ferris wheel type ride. The ride costs $1 and plays carnival music when in use. When no one is riding the wheel, Zeddy says on a regular basis, &quot;Come ride with me! All aboard the Zeddy Wheel!&quot; in an attempt to attract customers. Despite Zeddy being withdrawn as the official mascot of Zellers in 2005, the Zeddy Wheel remained in operation at stores featuring it unless it is out of service, and the voice track was unchanged over the years. Some wheels removed the big Zeddy sticker in favour of multiple, small generic stickers.

Zeddy remains used as a baby brand for products such as diapers and baby bath products.

During the Festive Finale campaign in 2011, Zeddy was reintroduced in weekly flyers for Zellers Toyland before closing their stores for Target or Walmart. The character was used as a static picture, but no animated television commercials of him were made during this season. However, some employees decided to wear the Zeddy costume to celebrate the return of this teddy bear. Shortly thereafter, in December 2011, Zellers launched a Zeddy Bucks promotion. Those who spent at least $50 before taxes on toys received a pair of red 2012 Summer Olympics mittens, plus a $10 Zeddy Bucks voucher. This voucher could only be used on a later date.

With the last Zellers stores set to close in 2013, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company announced in September 2012 that it was looking for a charity organization to adopt Zeddy so that the mascot could live on after Zellers. In a social media ad campaign, &quot;Zellers Everything Must GO Including Zeddy&quot;, Zeddy was featured in an online video where the mascot was abandoned in the woods by a Zellers executive telling Zeddy that Zellers was liquidating, and everything must go, including him. Organizations were invited to submit on Zellers Facebook page what their plans for Zeddy were. There were over 30,000 votes, and the final three contenders were Autism Ontario, Camp Trillium and Cystic Fibrosis Canada. Voters selected Camp Trillium as the winner and chosen adopter. There are several notable Zeddy iterations including most famously, bush pilot Zeddy.

<doc id="276257" wikidata="Q1820137" url="?curid=276257" title="Shoppers Drug Mart">
<text>Shoppers Drug Mart Inc. (colloquially Shoppers; named Pharmaprix in Quebec) is a Canadian retail pharmacy chain based in Toronto, Ontario. It has more than 1,300 stores in ten provinces and two territories.

The company was founded by pharmacist Murray Koffler in 1962; the Koffler family still retains ownership of the Super-Pharm pharmacy, which has locations in Israel, Poland, and formerly in China (as Ensure from 2005 to 2011). Super-Pharm&#x27;s logo is similar to that of Shoppers Drug Mart, which was created by the artist Sylvain Liu. It also uses some of the same private-label brands, such as &quot;Life Brand&quot; and &quot;Quo&quot;.

In 2014, Brampton-based Loblaw Companies acquired Shoppers Drug Mart for $12.4 billion in cash and stock. By early 2016, Shoppers had over 1,300 locations in Canada.

==Overview==
In addition to its retail formats, the company owns and operates several specialty services. This includes 56 Shoppers Home Health Care stores (renamed to &quot;Wellwise by Shoppers Drug Mart&quot;), which sell and service assisted-living devices, home-care products, and mobility and medical equipment; Shoppers Drug Mart Specialty Health Network, a provider of specialty drug distribution, pharmacy and comprehensive patient support services; and MediSystem Technologies Inc., a provider of pharmaceutical products and clinical services to long-term care facilities and retirement communities.

A new store concept, Wellwise, launched in fall 2017 as a single Toronto location; it sells healthy living products for seniors. In February 2018, wellwise.ca launched, making it Shoppers Drug Mart&#x27;s second e-commerce site, in addition to beautyboutique.ca. Many locations offer prescription delivery free of charge, employing a fleet of corporate-owned vehicles. Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Loblaw Companies Limited.

It is a participant in the voluntary Scanner Price Accuracy Code managed by the Retail Council of Canada.

==History==

At the age of twenty, Murray Koffler inherited two Koffler&#x27;s Drugs pharmacies from his father, Leon Koffler, the original at 376 College Street and a second store on Bathurst Street north of St. Clair Avenue West. Koffler also opened a suburban location at Don Mills Centre on the advice of E.P. Taylor. By 1962, Koffler&#x27;s had grown to a chain of 17 pharmacies, which he renamed &quot;Shoppers Drug Mart&quot; in the 1970s. The first store named &quot;Shoppers Drug Mart&quot; was at Shoppers World Danforth from which it derived the name.

Koffler revamped the concept of the 20th century drug store in Canada by removing the soda fountain and emphasizing the dispensary, requiring his pharmacists to wear starched white coats as a symbol of their professionalism. In the mid-1950s, he began acquiring other drug stores and organized them around a then-novel franchising concept: pharmacist associates would own and operate their own stores within the system and share in the profits. In 1968, Shoppers Drug Mart grew to 52 stores in Ontario by merging with 33 Plaza Drugstores. In 1971, Shoppers Drug Mart purchased 87 Cunningham Drug Stores in British Columbia and Alberta. In 1972, Koffler and the Steinberg grocery chain together launched the Pharmaprix pharmacy chain in Quebec. Koffler later bought out Steinberg&#x27;s 50% stake in 1979, to take full control of Pharmaprix. In 1974, Lord&#x27;s Supervalue Pharmacies 26 stores in Atlantic Canada joined the Shoppers Drug Mart family. In 1986 Shoppers Drug Mart bought Super X Drugstores, an Ontario-area chain of 72 stores. In 1986, Shoppers Drug Mart also purchased the J.W. Crooks Pharmacy stores in Thunder Bay Ontario (Mayor James White Crooks). In 1992, the company bought up the Western Canadian chain Pinder&#x27;s Drugs, and followed this in 1995, with a chain of 24 Bi-Rite Drug Stores based in western Canada. Also in 1995, Shoppers Drug Mart acquired 135 Big V Drugstores. In 1996, the first Shoppers Home Health Care store opened.

When Koffler retired in 1986, he sold the chain to Imasco. That same year, David Bloom, a former Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacist, was appointed chief executive officer of the company. Bloom would lead the organization until retiring in 2001, having devoted a total of 35 years of service to the company. During David Bloom&#x27;s tenure, Shoppers doubled its number of stores, quadrupled its sales and increased profit ten-fold. David Bloom also launched the Shoppers Optimum loyalty program in 2000.

In 2000, after Imasco Limited had been taken over by BAT Industries (formerly British American Tobacco), Shoppers was sold to a consortium of institutional investors including KKR, Bain Capital, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, Charlesbank Capital Partners, Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan, CIBC Capital Partners and Shoppers Drug Mart&#x27;s senior management and pharmacist/owners.

In 2001, Glenn Murphy was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the company. In November of that same year, Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation was publicly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 2002, Shoppers Drug Mart introduced its first large format stores, with more space and a stronger focus on cosmetic products. Typically the cosmetics section faces the entrance, with the pharmacy counter at the back and a convenience food section, called Food Essentials, near the front cash. In most suburban areas, this new format takes the form of new or relocated store, typically stand-alone big-box locations as opposed to smaller mall or strip-mall locations.

On April 26, 2007, the 1000th Shoppers Drug Mart store opened in Toronto, Ontario.

In recent years, the chain has been moving to decrease its reliance on pharmaceutical sales and increase sales on food and cosmetics. The store claims that in 2012, it increased its market share in food and that 51% of purchases now come from non-pharmaceutical items.
In Summer 2018, Shoppers Drug Mart opened its flagship Toronto, Ontario location at Yonge-Dundas Square in the space formerly occupied by Hard Rock Cafe.

In September 2018, Health Canada approved the chain as a licensed medical marijuana producer. The company does not intend to actually produce the product but had signed supply arrangements with companies such as Aurora Cannabis, Aphria, Inc., MedReleaf Corp. (owned by Aurora) and Tilray Inc., pending approval of its application for a license. On 17 October 2018, cannabis became legal for recreational use across Canada, but Shoppers has not given any indication that it has an interest in recreational sales. Its parent company, Loblaw Companies Ltd., had applied to (and won the right to) sell the product for such use in Newfoundland and Labrador.

=== Acquisition by Loblaw Companies ===
On July 15, 2013, Loblaw Companies announced that it would acquire Shoppers Drug Mart for $12.4 billion, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. The deal was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 21, 2014, and completed on March 28, 2014. Prior to the sale to Loblaws, U.S.-based Walgreens had considered to acquire Shoppers Drug Mart in the past.

As a result of the merger, the chain began to develop synergies with Loblaw&#x27;s grocery stores. Most prominently, Shoppers Drug Mart locations began to stock products from Loblaw&#x27;s President&#x27;s Choice &amp; No Name brands; likewise, Loblaw&#x27;s grocery stores could now stock Shoppers&#x27; &quot;Life&quot; brand products.

==Rewards program==
Customers can earn points through the PC Optimum program, formerly Shoppers Optimum. Members collect points that may be redeemed on purchases within the store. Shoppers Optimum members receive 15 points for every dollar spent at the store, excluding the purchase of lottery, tobacco products, transit tickets and passes, prescription items, any products containing codeine, Canada Post products, and gift cards that are not for the chain itself. Events for bonus point collecting and redemption (e.g., 20× the points, bonus redemption) are regularly held.

On November 8, 2017, Shoppers Drug Mart&#x27;s parent company, Loblaw, merged the program with Loblaw supermarket&#x27;s PC Plus reward program into PC Optimum effective February 1, 2018. Similarly to Optimum, customers receive 15 points per dollar spent at Shoppers Drug Mart locations (adjusted up to account for differences in point scale between Shoppers Optimum and PC Plus).

10,000 points are worth $10 and can only be redeemed in multiples of 10,000.

== Controversies ==
In 2024, Shoppers Drug Mart was criticized for enacting sales quotas on pharmacists for MedsCheck, a government sponsored program in Ontario. MedsCheck reimburses healthcare providers for medication reviews, allowing for a maximum billing of $75 per patient, which led to the profitability of enacting sales targets. CBC News reported that approximately 1.4 million dollars was billed to the province for a week in February 2024. A class action lawsuit was filed against the company in regards to these quotas.

<doc id="276258" wikidata="Q239275" url="?curid=276258" title="Evelyn Glennie">
<text>Dame Evelyn Elizabeth Ann Glennie, (born 19 July 1965) is a Scottish percussionist. She was selected as one of the two laureates for the Polar Music Prize of 2015.

==Early life==
Glennie was born in Methlick, Aberdeenshire, in Scotland. The indigenous musical traditions of northeast Scotland were important in her development as a musician. Her first instruments were the piano and the clarinet. Other influences were Glenn Gould, Jacqueline du Pré and Trilok Gurtu. She studied at Ellon Academy, Aberdeenshire and the Royal Academy of Music, London. 

She was a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the Cults Percussion Ensemble which was formed in 1976 by her school percussion peripatetic teacher Ron Forbes. They toured and recorded one album, which was re-released on Trunk Records in 2012.

==Career==
Glennie tours all over the world performing as a soloist with a wide variety of orchestras and electric musicians. She conducts master classes, consultations and engages in motivational speaking. She is a leading commissioner of new works for solo percussion.

Glennie also plays the Great Highland Bagpipes and has her own registered tartan known as &quot;The Rhythms of Evelyn Glennie&quot;.

Glennie performed at the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012, leading a thousand drummers in the opening piece of music &quot;And I Will Kis&quot;s, and also playing the Glennie Concert Aluphone in &quot;Caliban&#x27;s Dream&quot; during the ceremony for lighting the Olympic cauldron.

Glennie is a patron of the music charity Sound World.

On 7 April 2021, Glennie was named as Chancellor of Robert Gordon University, succeeding Sir Ian Wood in July 2021.

== Deafness ==
Glennie has been profoundly deaf since childhood, having started to lose her hearing at the age of 8. This does not inhibit her ability to perform. She regularly plays barefoot during live performances and studio recordings to feel the music.

Glennie contends that deafness is largely misunderstood by the public. She explains that her teacher Ron Forbes taught her to hear with parts of her body other than her ears. She felt the upper drum from the waist up and the lower drum from waist down. On her website Glennie published &quot;Hearing Essay&quot; in which she discusses her condition. Glennie also discusses how she feels music in different parts of her body in her TED talk &quot;How To Truly Listen&quot;, published in 2003, and a collection of her speeches and writings are published in her book &quot;Listen World!&quot;.

Evelyn launched the Evelyn Glennie Podcast in 2022, in which she invites popular personalities from the world of music, sport, television and academia to discuss their idea of listening and interpretation of sound. 

==Collaborations==
Glennie was featured on Icelandic singer Björk&#x27;s album &quot;Telegram&quot;, performing the duet &quot;My Spine&quot;. She also co-composed &quot;Oxygen&quot;. She has collaborated with many other musicians including former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett, Bela Fleck, Bobby McFerrin, Fred Frith, Mark Knopfler, The King&#x27;s Singers and Kodō.

In 2012, she collaborated with Underworld and Danny Boyle on the soundtrack to the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games performing live in the stadium.

In 2018, Glennie worked with Gregory Doran and the Royal Shakespeare Company composing the music for a production of &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. In the same year she began a collaboration with experimental jazz musicians Trio HLK, touring with them and appearing on their debut album Standard Time.

In 2020, Glennie collaborated with the music charity Sound World, composing a new piece &quot;The Grace of Silence&quot; for their Coronavirus Fund for Freelance Musicians. It was recorded by members of the Bristol Ensemble and released by Sound World in January 2021. It is the opening track on the album &quot;Reflections.&quot; Glennie also composed some of the music for the film &quot;Sound of Metal&quot; directed by Darius Marder. She is a prolific composer for the library music company Audio Network. Her works are published by Faber Music.

On 21 November 2007, the UK government announced an infusion of £332 million for music education. This resulted from successful lobbying spearheaded by Glennie, Sir James Galway, Julian Lloyd Webber, and the late Michael Kamen who (in 2002–03) together formed the Music in Education Consortium.

She was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 New Year Honours.

<text>Bard College is a private liberal arts college in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. The campus overlooks the Hudson River and Catskill Mountains within the Hudson River Historic District and is a National Historic Landmark.

Founded in 1860, the institution consists of a liberal arts college and a conservatory. The college offers undergraduate and graduate programs. The college has a network of over 35 affiliated programs, institutes, and centers, spanning twelve cities, five U.S. states, seven countries, and four continents.

== History ==

=== Origins and early years ===
During much of the nineteenth century, the land since owned by Bard was mainly composed of several country estates. These estates were called Blithewood, Bartlett, Sands and Ward Manor/Almont.

In 1853, John Bard and Margaret Bard purchased a part of the Blithewood estate and renamed it Annandale. John Bard was the grandson of Samuel Bard, a prominent doctor, a founder of Columbia University&#x27;s medical school, and physician to George Washington. John Bard was also the nephew of John McVickar, a professor at Columbia University. The family had strong connections with the Episcopal Church.
The following year, in 1854, John and Margaret established a parish school on their estate in order to educate the area&#x27;s children. A wood-frame cottage, known today as Bard Hall, served as a school on weekdays and a chapel on weekends. In 1857, the Bards expanded the parish by building the Chapel of the Holy Innocents next to Bard Hall. During this time, John Bard remained in close contact with the New York leaders of the Episcopal Church. The church suggested that he found a theological college.

With the promise of outside financial support, John Bard donated the unfinished chapel, and the surrounding , to the diocese in November 1858. In March 1860, St. Stephen&#x27;s College was founded. In 1861, construction began on the first St. Stephen&#x27;s College building, a stone collegiate Gothic dormitory called Aspinwall, after early trustee John Lloyd Aspinwall, brother of William Henry Aspinwall. During its initial years, the college relied on wealthy benefactors, like trustee Cornelius Vanderbilt, for funding.

The college began taking shape within four decades. In 1866, Ludlow Hall, an administrative building, was erected. Preston Hall was built in 1873 and used as a refectory. A set of four dormitories, collectively known as Stone Row, were completed in 1891. And in 1895, the Greek Revival Hoffman Memorial Library was built. The school officially changed its name to Bard College in 1934 in honor of its founder.

=== Growth and secularization ===

In the 20th century, social and cultural changes amongst New York&#x27;s high society would bring about the demise of the great estates. In 1914, Louis Hamersley purchased the fire-damaged Ward Manor/Almont estate and erected a Tudor style mansion and gatehouse, or what is today known as Ward Manor. Hamersley expanded his estate in 1926 by acquiring the abandoned Cruger&#x27;s Island estate. That same year, after Hamersley&#x27;s combined estate was purchased by William Ward, it was donated to charity and served as a retirement home for almost four decades.

By the mid-1900s, Bard&#x27;s campus significantly expanded. The Blithewood estate was donated to the college in 1951, and in 1963, Bard purchased of the Ward Manor estate, including the main manor house. The rest of the Ward Manor estate became the Tivoli Bays nature preserve.

In 1919, Bernard Iddings Bell became Bard&#x27;s youngest president at the age of 34. His adherence to classical education, decorum, and dress eventually clashed with the school&#x27;s push towards Deweyism and secularization, and he resigned in 1933.

In 1928, Bard merged with Columbia University, serving as an undergraduate school similar to Barnard College. Under the agreement, Bard remained affiliated with the Episcopal Church and retained control of its finances. The merger raised Bard&#x27;s prestige; however, it failed to provide financial support to the college during the Great Depression. So dire was Bard&#x27;s financial situation that in 1932, then-Governor of New York and College trustee Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a telegram to the likes of John D. Rockefeller Jr., George Eastman and Frederick William Vanderbilt requesting donations for the college.

On May 26, 1933, Donald Tewksbury, a Columbia professor, was appointed dean of the college. Although dean for only four years, Tewksbury had a lasting impact on the school. Tewksbury, an educational philosopher, had extensive ideas regarding higher education. While he was dean, Tewksbury steered the college into a more secular direction and changed its name from St. Stephen&#x27;s to Bard. He also placed a heavy academic emphasis on the arts, something atypical of colleges at the time, and set the foundations for Bard&#x27;s Moderation and Senior Project requirement. While Tewksbury never characterized Bard&#x27;s curriculum as &quot;progressive,&quot; the school would later be considered an early adopter of progressive education. In his 1943 study of early progressive colleges, titled &quot;General Education in the Progressive College&quot;, Louis T. Benezet used Bard as one of his three case studies.

During the 1940s, Bard provided a haven for intellectual refugees fleeing Europe. These included Hannah Arendt, the political theorist, Stefan Hirsch, the precisionist painter; Felix Hirsch, the political editor of the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;; the violinist Emil Hauser; the linguist Hans Marchand; the noted psychologist Werner Wolff; and the philosopher Heinrich Blücher.
Arendt is buried at Bard, alongside her husband Heinrich Blücher, as is eminent novelist Philip Roth.

In 1944, as a result of World War II, enrollment significantly dropped putting financial stress on the college. In order to increase enrollment, the college became co-educational, thereby severing all ties with Columbia. The college became an independent, secular, institution in 1944. Thus enrollment more than doubled, from 137 students in 1944, to 293 in 1947. 

=== Late twentieth and early twenty-first century ===

Donald Fagen and Walter Becker&#x27;s experiences at Bard prompted them to write the 1973 song &quot;My Old School&quot; for their rock group, Steely Dan. The song was motivated by the 1969 drug bust at Bard in which the college administration colluded. The DA involved was G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate notoriety. Fagen wrote another Steely Dan song, &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot;, about novelist, artist and former Bard faculty spouse Rikki Ducornet.

In 2020, Bard College and Central European University became the founding members of the Open Society University Network, a collaborative global education initiative endowed with US$1 billion. As part of this new initiative, the college received a US$100 million gift from the Open Society Foundations which ranks among the largest financial contributions to a U.S. institution in recent history. In 2021, philanthropist George Soros made a $500 million endowment pledge to Bard College. It is one of the largest pledges of money ever made to higher education in the United States.

In June 2021, Bard College was declared an &quot;undesirable organization&quot; in Russia, becoming the first international higher education organization to be branded with this designation. Bard president Botstein hypothesized that this tag was due their association with and funding from the Open Society Foundations which was also classified as undesirable in Russia and related conspiracy theories about George Soros.

== Campus ==
The campus of Bard College is in Annandale-on-Hudson, a hamlet in Dutchess County, New York, United States, in the town of Red Hook. It contains more than 70 buildings with a total gross building space of and was listed as a census-designated place in 2020. Campus buildings represent varied architectural styles, but the campus remains heavily influenced by the Collegiate Gothic and Postmodern styles.

Bard&#x27;s historic buildings are associated with the early development of the college and the history of the Hudson River estates (see Bard College History). During a late twentieth-century building boom, the college embraced a trend of building signature buildings designed by prominent architects like Venturi, Gehry, and Viñoly.

In January 2016, Bard purchased Montgomery Place, a estate adjacent to the Bard campus, with significant historic and cultural assets. The estate consists of a historic mansion, a farm, and some 20 smaller buildings. The college purchased the property from Historic Hudson Valley, the historical preservation organization that had owned Montgomery Place since the late 1980s. The addition of this property brings Bard&#x27;s total campus size to nearly along the Hudson River in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.

In late 2023, Bard purchased 260 acres of land adjacent to the Montgomery Place campus in Barrytown, which used to be the campus of the Unification Theological Seminary. The property, originally owned by the Livingston and later Aspinwall families, features a mansion designed by William Appleton Potter. It was acquired by the De La Salle Brothers in 1928, who completed a large seminary and normal institute there in 1931. In turn, the property was sold in 1974 to the Unification Church. Bard intends to use the space to provide new studios for the Center for Human Rights and the Arts and administrative offices for the Open Society University Network (OSUN), of which Bard is a founding member. The purchase of the property brings Bard&#x27;s total acreage to 1260 acres (510 ha).

The area around the campus first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 Census, with a population of 358.

The college has an amount of housing for faculty members. School-age dependents in this faculty housing are in the Red Hook Central School District (the CDP is within this school district).

== Academics ==

=== Rankings and awards ===
In its 2022-2023 edition of college rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Bard 60th overall, 5th in &quot;Most Innovative Schools&quot;, tied at 38th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;, tied at #70 in &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;, tied at #19 in &quot;First-Year Experiences&quot;, and 19th for &quot;Best Value&quot; out of 210 &quot;National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot; in the United States.

Bard&#x27;s Master of Fine Arts program was ranked one of ten most influential Master of Fine Arts programs in the world by &quot;Artspace Magazine&quot; in 2023.

Bard has been named a top producer of U.S. Fulbright Scholars. Many Bard alumni have also been named Watson Fellows, Critical Language Scholarship recipients, Davis Projects for Peace winners, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, and Peace Corps fellows, among other postgraduate awards.

===Undergraduate programs===
In the undergraduate college, Bard offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. There are 23 academic departments that offer over 40 major programs, as well as 12 interdisciplinary concentrations. The college was the first in the nation to offer a human rights major. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Social Sciences (140)
*Fine/Studio Arts (106)
*English Language and Literature/Letters (81)
*Biological and Physical Sciences (80)

In the three weeks preceding their first semester, first-year students attend the Language and Thinking (L&amp;T) program, an intensive, writing-centered introduction to the liberal arts. The interdisciplinary program, established in 1981, aims to &quot;cultivate habits of thoughtful reading and discussion, clear articulation, accurate self-critique, and productive collaboration.&quot; The program covers philosophy, history, science, poetry, fiction, and religion. In 2011, the core readings included works by Hannah Arendt, Franz Kafka, Frans de Waal, Stephen Jay Gould, Clifford Geertz, M. NourbeSe Philip, and Sophocles.

The capstone of the Bard undergraduate experience is the Senior Project, commonly referred to as SPROJ amongst its students. As with moderation, this project takes different forms in different departments. Many students write a paper of around eighty pages, which is then, as with work for moderation, critiqued by a board of three professors. Arts students must organize a series of concerts, recitals, or shows, or produce substantial creative work; math and science students, as well as some social science students, undertake research projects.

====Undergraduate admissions====
For the academic year 2022-2023, Bard&#x27;s acceptance rate stands at 46%. Out of the total 6,482 students who applied, 2,982 were admitted to the school. For the 2022–2023 academic year 447 students enrolled representing a yield rate of 15%. Admission trends note a 25% increase in applications in the 2022–2023 academic year. Bard does not require applicants to submit SAT or ACT test scores in order to apply. As an alternative, applicants may take an examination composed of 19 essay questions in four categories: Social Studies; Languages and Literature; Arts; and Science, Mathematics, and Computing, with applicants required to complete three 2,500-word essays covering three of the four categories. For admitted students who submitted test scores, 50% had an SAT score between 1296 and 1468 or an ACT score between 28 and 33, with a reported average GPA of 3.79. Admissions officials consider a student&#x27;s GPA a very important academic factor. Honors, AP, and IB classes are important, an applicant&#x27;s high school class rank is considered, and letters of recommendation are considered very important for admissions officials at Bard.

=== Graduate programs ===
Bard College offers a range of postgraduate degree programs, including the Bard MFA, Bard Graduate Center, Center for Curatorial Studies, Center for Human Rights and the Arts, Center for Environmental Policy, Bard MBA in Sustainability, Levy Economics Institute, the Master of Arts in Teaching, and the Master of Arts in Global Studies.

Bard maintains its own endowment of approximately $412 million. In July 2020, Bard received a gift of $100 million from the Open Society Foundations, which will dispense $10 million yearly over a period of ten years. In April 2021, Bard received a $500 million endowment challenge grant from George Soros. Once matched, on a five-year timeline, Bard will have an endowment of more than $1 billion.

== Programs, centers, and associated institutes ==

Bard has developed several graduate programs and research institutes, including the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts, the Levy Economics Institute which began offering a Masters of Science in Economic Theory and Policy in 2014, the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture, the Bard Center for Environmental Policy, the Bard College Conservatory of Music, the ICP-Bard Program in Advanced Photographic Studies in Manhattan, the Master of Arts in Teaching Program (MAT), the Bard College Clemente Program, and the Bard Graduate Center in Manhattan.

In 1990, Bard College acquired, on permanent loan, art collector Marieluise Hessel&#x27;s substantial collection of important contemporary artwork. In 2006, Hessel contributed another $8 million (USD) for the construction of a 17,000-square-foot addition to Bard&#x27;s Center for Curatorial Studies building, in which the collection is exhibited.

The Bard Prison Initiative (BPI) provides a liberal arts degree to incarcerated individuals (prison education) in five prisons in New York State, and enrolls nearly 200 students. Since federal funding for prison education programs was eliminated in 1994, BPI is one of only a small number of programs of its kind in the country.

Bard awards the Bard Fiction Prize annually to &quot;a promising emerging writer who is an American citizen aged 39 years or younger at the time of application&quot;. The prize is $30,000 and an appointment as writer-in-residence at the college.

The Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities is located at Bard College. The center hosts an annual public conference, offers courses, runs various related academic programs, and houses research fellows.

In February 2009, Bard announced the first dual degree program between a Palestinian university and an American institution of higher education. The college entered into a collaboration with Al-Quds University involving an honors college, a master&#x27;s program in teaching and a model high school.

In accordance with AlQuds-Bard requirements, students are not allowed to decide their major during the first year of their studies; instead, as a liberal arts college, students are advised to diverge in different classes that would allow them to decide what program they would like to take interest in as in the following year. Students are encouraged to look upon different classes to help them decide the subject they would mostly enjoy studying. Bard gives students the opportunity to dissect different programs before committing to a specific major. As a policy, throughout a student&#x27;s undergraduate years, they must distribute their credits among different courses so that they can liberally experience the different courses Bard has to offer.

In June 2011, Bard officially acquired the Longy School of Music in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in November 2011, Bard took ownership of the European College of Liberal Arts in Berlin, Germany, to become Bard College Berlin.

In 2013, Bard entered into a comprehensive agreement with Soochow University in Suzhou, China, that will include a joint program between the Soochow University School of Music and the Bard College Conservatory of Music, exploration leading to the establishment of The Bard College Liberal Arts Academy at Soochow University, and student exchange.

In 2020, Bard announced that through the new Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Advanced Achievement Scholars program the college will offer admission to high school juniors within 120 miles from the college based on an essay process based on the popular Bard Entrance Exam, first launched in 2013.

== Student life ==

Over 120 student clubs are financed through Bard&#x27;s Convocation Fund, which is distributed once a semester by an elected student body and ratified during a public forum. Bard College has one print newspaper, the &quot;Bard Free Press&quot;, which was awarded a Best in Show title by the Associated Collegiate Press in 2013. In 2003, the &quot;Bard Free Press&quot; won Best Campus Publication in &quot;SPIN Magazine&#x27;s &quot;first annual Campus Awards. Student-run literary magazines include the semiannual &quot;Lux, The Moderator,&quot; and &quot;Sui Generis&quot;, a journal of translations and of original poetry in languages other than English. &quot;The Draft&quot;, a human rights journal, the &quot;Bard Journal of the Social Sciences,&quot; &quot;Bard Science Journal&quot;, and &quot;Qualia&quot;, a philosophy journal, are also student-published.

WXBC was founded in 1947. In 2006, WXBC was nominated for &quot;Station of the Year&quot; and &quot;Biggest Improvement&quot; in the CMJ College Radio Awards.

Bard also has an independent music scene. The college&#x27;s Old Gym was once a popular location for concerts and parties in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. In 2004, the Old Gym was shut down and in spring 2006 transformed into a student-run theater. Many activities that once took place there, occur in the smaller SMOG building. SMOG is primarily used as a music venue featuring student-run bands.

<text>Rosa laevigata, the Cherokee rose, is a white, fragrant rose native to southern China, Taiwan and Vietnam. It is an invasive species in countries including Australia, Japan and the United States.

==Description==
It is an evergreen climbing shrub, scrambling over other shrubs and small trees to heights of up to . The leaves are long, with usually three leaflets, sometimes five leaflets, bright glossy green and glabrous. The flowers are diameter, fragrant, with pure white petals and yellow stamens, and are followed by bright red and bristly hips diameter. The flower stem is also very bristly.

==Cultivation==
The species was introduced to the southeastern United States in about 1780, where it soon became naturalized, and was then given its English common name.

==Cultural references==
The flower has no association to Cherokee culture. It is a non-indigenous invasive species that climbs over and smothers existing vegetation. 

Though it has no connection to the Cherokee Nation, it is occasionally used as a symbol of Cherokee resistance following their eviction from the southern United States via the Trail of Tears.

<text>In radio communication, skywave or skip refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted back toward Earth from the ionosphere, an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere. Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth, skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands.

As a result of skywave propagation, a signal from a distant AM broadcasting station, a shortwave station, or – during sporadic E propagation conditions (principally during the summer months in both hemispheres) – a distant VHF FM or TV station can sometimes be received as clearly as local stations. Most long-distance shortwave (high frequency) radio communication – between 3 and 30 MHz – is a result of skywave propagation. Since the early 1920s amateur radio operators (or &quot;hams&quot;), limited to lower transmitter power than broadcast stations, have taken advantage of skywave for long-distance (or &quot;DX&quot;) communication.

Skywave propagation is distinct from line-of-sight propagation, in which radio waves travel in a straight line, and from non-line-of-sight propagation.

==Local and distant skywave propagation==

Skywave transmissions can be used for long-distance communications (DX) by waves directed at a low angle as well as relatively local communications via nearly vertically directed waves (near vertical incidence skywaves – NVIS).

===Low-angle skywaves===
The ionosphere is a region of the upper atmosphere, from about 80 km (50 miles) to 1000 km (600 miles) in altitude, where neutral air is ionized by solar photons, solar particles, and cosmic rays. When high-frequency signals enter the ionosphere at a low angle they are bent back towards the Earth by the ionized layer. If the peak ionization is strong enough for the chosen frequency, a wave will exit the bottom of the layer earthwards – as if obliquely reflected from a mirror. Earth&#x27;s surface (ground or water) then reflects the descending wave back up again towards the ionosphere.

When operating at frequencies just below the maximum usable frequency, losses can be quite small, so the radio signal may effectively &quot;bounce&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; between the Earth and ionosphere two or more times (multi-hop propagation), even following the curvature of the Earth. Consequently, even signals of only a few Watts can sometimes be received many thousands of miles away. This is what enables shortwave broadcasts to travel all over the world. If the ionization is not great enough, the wave only curves slightly downwards, and subsequently upwards as the ionization peak is passed so that it exits the top of the layer only slightly displaced. The wave is then lost in space. To prevent this, a lower frequency must be chosen. With a single &quot;hop&quot;, path distances up to 3500 km (2200 miles) may be reached. Longer transmissions can occur with two or more hops.

===Near-vertical skywaves===

Skywaves directed almost vertically are referred to as &quot;near-vertical-incidence skywaves&quot; (&quot;NVIS&quot;). At some frequencies, generally in the lower shortwave region, the high angle skywaves will be reflected directly back towards the ground. When the wave returns to ground it is spread out over a wide area, allowing communications within several hundred miles of the transmitting antenna. NVIS enables local plus regional communications, even from low-lying valleys, to a large area, for example, an entire state or small country. Coverage of a similar area via a line-of-sight VHF transmitter would require a very high mountaintop location. NVIS is thus useful for statewide networks, such as those needed for emergency communications. In short wave broadcasting, NVIS is very useful for regional broadcasts that are targeted to an area that extends out from the transmitter location to a few hundred miles, such as would be the case in a country or language group to be reached from within the borders of that country. This will be much more economical than using multiple FM (VHF) or AM broadcast transmitters. Suitable antennas are designed to produce a strong lobe at high angles. When short range skywave is undesirable, as when an AM broadcaster wishes to avoid interference between the ground wave and sky wave, anti-fading antennas are used to suppress the waves being propagated at the higher angles.

===Intermediate distance coverage===

 For every distance, from local to maximum distance transmission, (DX), there is an optimum &quot;take off&quot; angle for the antenna, as shown here. For example, using the F layer during the night, to best reach a receiver 500 miles away, an antenna should be chosen that has a strong lobe at 40 degrees elevation. One can also see that for the longest distances, a lobe at low angles (below 10 degrees) is best. For NVIS, angles above 45 degrees are optimum. Suitable antennas for long distance would be a high Yagi or a rhombic; for NVIS, a dipole or array of dipoles about .2 wavelengths above ground; and for intermediate distances, a dipole or Yagi at about .5 wavelengths above ground. Vertical patterns for each type of antenna are used to select the proper antenna.

===Fading===

At any distance sky waves will fade. The layer of ionospheric plasma with sufficient ionization (the reflective surface) is not fixed, but undulates like the surface of the ocean. Varying reflection efficiency from this changing surface can cause the reflected signal strength to change, causing &quot;fading&quot; in shortwave broadcasts. Even more serious fading can occur when signals arrive via two or more paths, for example when both single-hop and double-hop waves interfere with other, or when a skywave signal and a ground-wave signal arrive at about the same strength. This is the most common source of fading with nighttime AM broadcast signals.
Fading is always present with sky wave signals, and except for digital signals such as Digital Radio Mondiale seriously limit the fidelity of shortwave broadcasts.

== Other considerations ==

VHF signals with frequencies above about 30 MHz usually penetrate the ionosphere and are not returned to the Earth&#x27;s surface. E-skip is a notable exception, where VHF signals including FM broadcast and VHF TV signals are frequently reflected to the Earth during late spring and early summer. E-skip rarely affects UHF frequencies, except for very rare occurrences below 500 MHz.

Frequencies below approximately 10 MHz (wavelengths longer than 30 meters), including broadcasts in the mediumwave and shortwave bands (and to some extent longwave), propagate most efficiently by skywave at night. Frequencies above 10 MHz (wavelengths shorter than 30 meters) typically propagate most efficiently during the day. Frequencies lower than 3 kHz have a wavelength longer than the distance between the Earth and the ionosphere. The maximum usable frequency for skywave propagation is strongly influenced by sunspot number.

Skywave propagation is usually degraded – sometimes seriously – during geomagnetic storms. Skywave propagation on the sunlit side of the Earth can be entirely disrupted during sudden ionospheric disturbances.

Because the lower-altitude layers (the E-layer in particular) of the ionosphere largely disappear at night, the refractive layer of the ionosphere is much higher above the surface of the Earth at night. This leads to an increase in the &quot;skip&quot; or &quot;hop&quot; distance of the skywave at night.

==History of discovery==

Amateur radio operators are credited with the discovery of skywave propagation on the shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used ground wave propagation at very low frequencies, which are attenuated along the path. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal attenuation. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.

Radio amateurs conducted the first successful transatlantic tests using waves shorter than those used by commercial services in December 1921, operating in the 200 meter mediumwave band (1500 kHz)—the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 30 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200 meters.

Extreme interference at the upper edge of the 150-200 meter band—the official wavelengths allocated to amateurs by the Second National Radio Conference in 1923—forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150 meters (2 MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications below 150 meters completed hundreds of long-distance two-way contacts on 100 meters (3 MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two-way contacts in November 1923, on 110 meters (2.72 MHz)

By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6000 miles (~9600 km) and more. On 21 September several amateurs in California completed two way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand. On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90-minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On October 10, the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs at 80 meters (3.75 MHz), 40 meters (7 MHz) and 20 meters (14 MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the 10-meter band (28 MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference on 25 November 1927. The 15-meter band (21 MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1 May 1952.

===Marconi===
Guglielmo Marconi was the first to show that radios could communicate beyond line-of-sight, using the reflective properties of the ionosphere. On December 12, 1901, he sent a message around from his transmission station in Cornwall, England, to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland (now part of Canada). However, Marconi believed the radio waves were following the curvature of the Earth – the reflective properties of the ionosphere that enables &#x27;sky waves&#x27; were not yet understood. Skepticism from the scientific community and his wired telegraph competitors drove Marconi to continue experimenting with wireless transmissions and associated business ventures over the next few decades.

In June and July 1923, Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s land-to-ship transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu Wireless Station, Cornwall, to his yacht Ellette in the Cape Verde Islands. In September 1924, Marconi transmitted during daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. Marconi, in July 1924, entered into contracts with the British General Post Office (GPO) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the Imperial Wireless Chain. The UK-to-Canada shortwave &quot;Beam Wireless Service&quot; went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.

Far more spectrum is available for long-distance communication in the shortwave bands than in the long wave bands; and shortwave transmitters, receivers and antennas were orders of magnitude less expensive than the multi-hundred kilowatt transmitters and monstrous antennas needed for long wave.

Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s, similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long-distance communications had moved from transoceanic cables and long-wave wireless services to shortwave &quot;skip&quot; transmission, and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave also ended the need for multimillion-dollar investments in new transoceanic telegraph cables and massive long-wave wireless stations, although some existing transoceanic telegraph cables and commercial long-wave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s.

The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference in 1928 &quot;to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services&quot;. It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to Cable and Wireless Ltd. in 1934.

<text>The Goldschmidt classification,
developed by Victor Goldschmidt (1888–1947), is a geochemical classification which groups the chemical elements within the Earth according to their preferred host phases into lithophile (rock-loving), siderophile (iron-loving), chalcophile (sulfide ore-loving or chalcogen-loving), and atmophile (gas-loving) or volatile (the element, or a compound in which it occurs, is liquid or gaseous at ambient surface conditions).

Some elements have affinities to more than one phase. The main affinity is given in the table below and a discussion of each group follows that table.

==Lithophile elements==
Lithophile elements () are those that remain on or close to the surface because they combine readily with oxygen, forming compounds that did not sink into the Earth&#x27;s core. The lithophile elements include Al, B, Ba, Be, Br, Ca, Cl, Cr, Cs, F, I, Hf, K, Li, Mg, Na, Nb, O, P, Rb, Sc, Si, Sr, Ta, Th, Ti, U, V, Y, Zr, W and the lanthanides or rare earth elements (REE).

Lithophile elements mainly consist of the highly reactive metals of the s- and f-blocks. They also include a small number of reactive nonmetals, and the more reactive metals of the d-block such as titanium, zirconium and vanadium.

Most lithophile elements form very stable ions with an electron configuration of a noble gas (sometimes with additional f-electrons). The few that do not, such as silicon, phosphorus and boron, form strong covalent bonds with oxygen, often involving pi bonding. Their strong affinity for oxygen causes lithophile elements to associate very strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that thus rose towards the crust during planetary differentiation. The more soluble minerals formed by the alkali metals tend to concentrate in seawater or arid regions where they can crystallise. The less soluble lithophile elements are concentrated on ancient continental shields where soluble minerals have been weathered.

Because of their strong affinity for oxygen, most lithophile elements are enriched in the Earth&#x27;s crust relative to their abundance in the solar system. The most reactive s- and f-block metals, which form either saline or metallic hydrides, are known to be extraordinarily enriched on Earth as a whole relative to their solar abundances. This is because during the earliest stages of the Earth&#x27;s formation, the abundance of stable forms of each element was determined by how readily it forms volatile hydrides; these volatiles then could &quot;escape&quot; the proto-Earth, leaving behind those elements unreactive with hydrogen. Under these conditions, the s- and f-block metals were strongly enriched during the formation of the Earth. The most enriched elements are rubidium, strontium and barium, which between them account for over 50 percent by mass of all elements heavier than iron in the Earth&#x27;s crust.

The nonmetallic lithophilesphosphorus and the halogensexist on Earth as ionic salts with s-block metals in pegmatites and seawater. With the exception of fluorine, whose hydride forms hydrogen bonds and is therefore of relatively low volatility, these elements have had their concentrations on Earth significantly reduced through escape of volatile hydrides during the Earth&#x27;s formation. Although they are present in the Earth&#x27;s crust in concentrations quite close to their solar abundances, phosphorus and the heavier halogens are probably significantly depleted &quot;on Earth as a whole&quot; relative to their solar abundances.

Several transition metals, including chromium, molybdenum, iron and manganese, show &quot;both&quot; lithophile &quot;and&quot; siderophile characteristics and can be found in both these two layers. Although these metals form strong bonds with oxygen and are never found in the Earth&#x27;s crust in the free state, metallic forms of these elements are thought very likely to exist in the core of the earth as relics from when the atmosphere did not contain oxygen. Like the &quot;pure&quot; siderophiles, these elements (except iron) are considerably depleted in the crust relative to their solar abundances.

Owing to their strong affinity for oxygen, lithophile metals, although they form the great bulk of the metallic elements in Earth&#x27;s crust, were never available as free metals before the development of electrolysis. With this development, many lithophile metals are of considerable value as structural metals (magnesium, aluminium, titanium, vanadium) or as reducing agents (sodium, magnesium, calcium).

The non-metals phosphorus and the halogens were also not known to early chemists, though production of these elements is less difficult than of metallic lithophiles since electrolysis is required only with fluorine. Elemental chlorine is particularly important as an oxidizing agentusually being made by electrolysis of sodium chloride.

==Siderophile elements==


Siderophile elements () are the transition metals which tend to sink towards the core during planetary differentiation, because they dissolve readily in iron either as solid solutions or in the molten state. Some sources include elements which are not transition metals in their list of siderophiles, such as germanium. Other sources may also differ in their list based on the temperature being discussedniobium, vanadium, chromium, and manganese may be considered siderophiles or not, depending on the assumed temperature and pressure. Also confusing the issue is that some elements, such as the aforementioned manganese, as well as molybdenum, form strong bonds with oxygen, but in the free state (as they existed on the early Earth when free oxygen did not exist) can mix so easily with iron that they do not concentrate in the siliceous crust, as do true lithophile elements. Iron, meanwhile, is simply &quot;everywhere&quot;.

The siderophile elements include the highly siderophilic ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, rhenium, osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold, the moderately siderophilic cobalt and nickel, in addition to the &quot;disputed&quot; elements mentioned earliersome sources even include tungsten and silver.

Most siderophile elements have practically no affinity for oxygen: indeed oxides of gold are thermodynamically unstable. They form stronger bonds with carbon or sulfur, but even these are not strong enough to separate out with the chalcophile elements. Thus, siderophile elements are bound with iron through metallic bonding in the Earth&#x27;s core, where pressures may be high enough to keep the iron solid. Manganese, iron, and molybdenum &quot;do&quot; form strong bonds with oxygen, but in the free state (as on the early Earth) can mix so easily with iron that they do not concentrate in the siliceous crust, as do true lithophile elements. However, ores of manganese are found in much the same sites as are those of aluminium and titanium, owing to manganese&#x27;s great reactivity towards oxygen.

Because they are so concentrated in the dense core, siderophile elements are known for their rarity in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Most of them have always been known as precious metals because of this. Iridium is the rarest transition metal occurring within the Earth&#x27;s crust, with an abundance by mass of less than one part per billion. Mineable deposits of precious metals usually form as a result of the erosion of ultramafic rocks, but are not highly concentrated even compared to their crustal abundances, which are typically several orders of magnitude below their solar abundances. However, because they are concentrated in the Earth&#x27;s mantle and Earth&#x27;s core, siderophile elements are believed to be present in the Earth as a whole (including the core) in something approaching their solar abundances.

==Chalcophile elements==
The chalcophile elements () include Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Ga, Ge, Hg, In, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Sn, Te, Tl and Zn.

Chalcophile elements are those that remain on or close to the surface because they combine readily with sulfur and some other chalcogens other than oxygen, forming compounds which did not sink along with iron towards the Earth&#x27;s core. Chalcophile elements are those metals and heavier nonmetals that have a low affinity for oxygen and prefer to bond with sulfur as highly insoluble sulfides.

Because these sulfides are much denser than the silicate minerals formed by lithophile elements, chalcophile elements separated below the lithophiles at the time of the first crystallization of the Earth&#x27;s crust. This has led to their depletion in the Earth&#x27;s crust relative to their solar abundances, though because the minerals they form are nonmetallic, this depletion has not reached the levels found with siderophile elements.

However, because they formed volatile hydrides in the accreting protosolar nebula when the controlling redox reaction was the oxidation or reduction of hydrogen, the less metallic chalcophile elements are strongly depleted on Earth as a whole relative to cosmic abundances. This is most especially true of the chalcogens selenium and tellurium (which formed volatile hydrogen selenide and hydrogen telluride, respectively), which for this reason are among the rarest elements found in the Earth&#x27;s crust (to illustrate, tellurium is only about as abundant as platinum).

The most metallic chalcophile elements (of the copper, zinc and boron groups) may mix to some degree with iron in the Earth&#x27;s core. They are not likely to be depleted on Earth as a whole relative to their solar abundances since they do not form volatile hydrides. Zinc and gallium are somewhat &quot;lithophile&quot; in nature because they often occur in silicate or related minerals and form quite strong bonds with oxygen. Gallium, notably, is sourced mainly from bauxite, an aluminum hydroxide ore in which gallium ions substitute for chemically similar aluminum.

Although no chalcophile element is of high abundance in the Earth&#x27;s crust, chalcophile elements constitute the bulk of commercially important metals. This is because, whereas lithophile elements require energy-intensive electrolysis for extraction, chalcophiles can be easily extracted by reduction, and chalcophiles&#x27; geochemical concentrationwhich in extreme cases can exceed 100,000 times their average crustal abundance. These greatest enrichments occur in high plateaus like the Tibetan Plateau and the Bolivian Altiplano where large quantities of chalcophile elements have been uplifted through plate tectonics. A side-effect of this in modern times is that the rarest chalcophiles (like mercury) are so completely exploited that their value as minerals has almost completely disappeared.

==Atmophile elements==
The atmophile elements () are H, C, N and the noble gases.

Atmophile elements (also called &quot;volatile elements&quot;) are defined as those that remain mostly on or above Earth&#x27;s surface because they are, or occur in, liquids and/or gases at temperatures and pressures found on the surface. The noble gases do not form stable compounds and occur as monatomic gases, while nitrogen, although highly reactive as the free atom, bonds so strongly into diatomic molecular nitrogen that all oxides of nitrogen are thermodynamically unstable with respect to nitrogen and oxygen. Consequently, with the development of free oxygen in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, ammonia was oxidised to molecular nitrogen which has come to form four-fifths of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Carbon is also classed as an atmophile because it forms very strong multiple bonds with oxygen in carbon monoxide (slowly oxidised in the atmosphere) and carbon dioxide. The latter is the fourth-largest constituent of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, while carbon monoxide occurs naturally from various sources (volcanoes, combustion) and has a residence time in the atmosphere of a few months.

Hydrogen, which occurs in water, is also classed as an atmophile. Water is classified as a volatile, because most of it is liquid or gas, even though it can exist as a solid compound at Earth&#x27;s surface. Water can also be incorporated into other minerals as water of crystallization (as in gypsum) or through ionic and hydrogen bonding (as in talc), giving hydrogen some lithophile character.

Because all atmophile elements are either gases or form volatile hydrides, atmophile elements are strongly depleted on Earth as a whole relative to their solar abundances owing to losses from the atmosphere during the formation of the Earth. The heavier noble gases (krypton, xenon) are the rarest stable elements on Earth. (In fact they, along with neon, were all first isolated and described by William Ramsay and Morris Travers and assistants, who gave them names with Ancient Greek derivations of &#x27;hidden&#x27;, &#x27;stranger&#x27;, and &#x27;new&#x27;, respectively.)

Argon is the exception among the noble gases: it is the third-most abundant component of Earth&#x27;s present-day atmosphere after nitrogen and oxygen, comprising . Argon-40 is a stable daughter of radioactive potassium-40, and argon is heavy enough to be gravitationally captured by the post-accretion Earth, so while the proto-Earth&#x27;s primordial argon was mostly driven off, this radiogenic argon has accumulated over geologic time. This makes Earth&#x27;s argon abundance substantially different from cosmic abundance ratios for argon, being enormously enriched in , while predominates cosmically.

==Trace and synthetic elements==
Synthetic elements are excluded from the classification, as they do not occur naturally.

Trace radioactive elements (namely Tc, Pm, Po, At, Rn, Fr, Ra, Ac, Pa, Np, Pu) are also treated as synthetic. Although these do occur in nature, their occurrence is dependent on their long-lived parents Th and U, and they are not very mobile. For instance, polonium&#x27;s chemistry would predict it to be a chalcophile, but it tends to occur instead as a lithophile along with its parent uranium. Even radon, a gas at standard conditions, does not usually have time to travel very far from the original uranium source before decaying. When needed, these elements are typically produced synthetically in nuclear reactors instead of extraction from ores.

<text>The Goethals Bridge () is a pair of cable-stayed bridge spans connecting Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Staten Island, New York, United States. The spans cross a strait known as Arthur Kill, and replaced a cantilever bridge span built in 1928. The bridge is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The New Jersey side is about south of Newark Liberty International Airport. The bridge and its predecessor are named for Major General George Washington Goethals, who supervised construction of the Panama Canal and was the first consulting engineer of the Port Authority.

The eastbound span opened on June 10, 2017, at which time the original span was closed. The old cantilever span was dismantled in January 2018 and the new westbound span opened on May 21, 2018.

== Original bridge ==

The original Goethals bridge was a four lane steel truss cantilever design by John Alexander Low Waddell, who also designed the nearby Outerbridge Crossing. It had a long central span, was long, wide, and had a vertical clearance of .

== Planning for a new bridge ==
Starting in 1985, the Port Authority looked at 27 different alternatives to add capacity between Staten Island and New Jersey. By 1990, senior executives decided that the best way to accommodate growth was to build a new span, parallel to the existing Goethals Bridge. In October 1997, the Port Authority issued a final environmental impact statement, but by that time Staten Island officials had lined up against the project, citing the potential for increased traffic through their borough.

A Port Authority study initiated in 2001 suggested that the optimal solution was an entirely new span. The choosing of a full replacement option was followed by the submittal of several design alternatives, alongside a &quot;no build&quot; option. The new bridge design, upon the completion of the westbound span, also included additional lanes of traffic, high-speed E-ZPass lanes, and a reconstruction and widening of Interstate 278 from exit 4 in New York (NY 440 south) to Route 439 in New Jersey. The span was demolished starting in January 2018, after the opening of the replacement bridges.

==New bridge==
The initial alternatives put forth in mid-2006 included the option of twin three-lane replacement bridges north and south of the original alignment, which was eliminated; and twin three-lane replacement bridges (one south, and one along the original alignment), with the latter being built after the demolition of the original bridge, which was refined to be a single-span bridge instead of twin bridges. The twin-bridge alternative was dropped because of a height restriction set up by the FAA to prevent interferences with flights at Newark Liberty International Airport. The Goethals Bridge towers were not to exceed 272 feet in height and required to slant outwards because of aircraft flight patterns. This would also prevent ice from falling onto the roadway during winter months. Public open houses were held in Staten Island and Elizabeth, and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was issued. Formal public hearings on the DEIS were held in July 2009.

All alternatives proposed that the bridge be single level, cable-stayed, double spans, separated by towers with a height of above the high-water mark of the Arthur Kill shipping channel. The main span of each bridge holds three lanes with a outer shoulder and inner shoulder. The westbound span features a new walkway for pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, permanent access roads would be built under the bridge on land for maintenance, security, and construction purposes. Lastly, space would be left in between the two bridges to accommodate potential mass-transit services. For mass transit, studies indicated that a bus-only lane was not economically viable but that a high-occupancy vehicle lane open to buses as well as high-occupancy autos would be appropriate during rush hours if traffic supported it. Provision for rail transit was rejected; however, planners decided that whatever alternative was constructed, the design and structural integrity should ideally be able to be retrofitted for such at a later date. The suggestion for a freight rail connection was dismissed as uneconomical.

Also as part of the construction, improvements to approaches and nearby interchanges were made. These include the New Jersey Turnpike exit 13 toll plaza, the Staten Island toll plaza, and the Interstate 278/NY 440 interchange. In addition, while separate from the bridge replacement project, the New Jersey Department of Transportation may construct full movements at the Interstate 278/U.S. Route 1/9 junction to coincide with the bridge&#x27;s replacement.

On April 24, 2013, the Port Authority approved the $1.5-billion Goethals Bridge Project for preliminary funding, and broke ground in May 2014. The old bridge was closed on June 9, 2017, with eastbound traffic using the new eastbound bridge starting on June 10 and westbound traffic opening the next day. Initially, the new eastbound span carried 2 lanes of traffic in each direction, with each lane 11 feet wide until the new westbound span is complete. Once completed, the new westbound span would restore pedestrian and bicycle access. Westbound traffic was shifted from the new eastbound span to the newly opened westbound span on May 21, 2018. The bikeway and pedestrian walkway was set to open by mid-2018 but was then pushed back to an undetermined date. The bike path and pedestrian walkway finally opened on March 4, 2020.

The Goethals Bridge Replacement Project was given several prestigious awards upon its completion. In the highway/bridge category, the project won an ENR New York Best Projects and the Excellence in safety award, and it received the ENR New York&#x27;s Project of the Year for 2018.

==Tolls==
, the tolls-by-mail rate going from New Jersey to New York City is $18.31 for cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York City to New Jersey. New Jersey and New York–issued E-ZPass users are charged $14.06 for cars and $13.06 for motorcycles during off-peak hours, and $16.06 for cars and $15.06 for motorcycles during peak hours. Users with E-ZPass issued from agencies outside of New Jersey and New York are charged the tolls-by-mail rate. Frequent users traveling more than three trips per month can receive discounts under the &quot;Staten Island Bridges Plan&quot; ($8.03 per trip for cars at all times).

Tolls are only collected for eastbound traffic. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to south- or eastbound-only at that time.

Open-road cashless tolling began on September 4, 2019. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries located on the Staten Island side. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

<text>Freezing Point (Chinese: 冰点, Bīngdiǎn) was a news journal in the People&#x27;s Republic of China which was the subject of controversy over its criticism of Communist Party officials and the sympathetic ear it lent to a Chinese historian who had criticized official history textbooks.

==History and profile==
&quot;Freezing Point&quot; was started in 1995 as a one-page publication and was expanded into a weekly magazine in 2004. A weekly supplement to &quot;China Youth Daily&quot;, it was temporarily closed down by officials 24 January 2006, but was allowed to reopen in March that year, though without its former editor Li Datong and without Taiwan-based columnist Lung Yingtai.

The official reason for the January 2006 shutdown of &quot;Freezing Point&quot; was an article by history professor Yuan Weishi of Sun Yat-sen University. The article dissented from the official view of the Boxer Rebellion.

<doc id="276308" wikidata="Q4449034" url="?curid=276308" title="Old Norse orthography">
<text>The orthography of the Old Norse language was diverse, being written in both Runic and Latin alphabets, with many spelling conventions, variant letterforms, and unique letters and signs. In modern times, scholars established a standardized spelling for the language. When Old Norse names are used in texts in other languages, modifications to this spelling are often made. In particular, the names of Old Norse mythological figures often have several different spellings.

The first appearance of an ancestral stage of Old Norse in a written runic form dates back to (with the Øvre Stabu spearhead traditionally dated to the late 2nd century), at this time still showing an archaic language form (similar to reconstructed Proto-Germanic) termed Proto-Norse. Old Norse proper appears by . While there are remains of Viking runestones from the Viking Age, today they are rare, and vary in the use of orthography depending on when they were created. Rune stones created near the end of the Viking Age tend to have a greater influence from Old English runes.

An understanding of the writing system of Old Norse is crucial for fully understanding the Old Norse language. Studies of remaining rune stones from the Viking Age reveal many nuances about the spoken language, such as the constant use of alliteration. A comparison of various whetstones from this time period with the works of Snorri Sturluson reveals that alliteration was common in many Old Norse writings, and were not only present in skaldic works. This would then suggest that the Vikings closely tied their language to their auditory sense, which in turn would have helped with the continual transfer of their cultural memory, which was also closely tied to their language.

== Latin alphabet orthography ==

The following table gives various attested spellings of sounds and their IPA transcription. In general usage, an orthographic distinction of phones or phonemes is not necessarily held by every writer. For example, an author may only distinguish some vowels by length, and orthographic devices could be mixed and matched. Where the table lists a long-or-short phoneme , a specifically short or long phoneme represents additional spellings not covered by length marking rules. Likewise, a phonetic entry only lists spellings not used by the equivalent phoneme(s). N/A is used when no specific spelling is used, e.g. where all long vowel spellings are found using the rules for deriving long vowel spellings from the short vowel, or no general spelling is used, e.g. when short and long vowels are always spelled differently.

Legend:
* U: Unstressed
* E: Chiefly eastern
* : Long or short. See columns for length and gemination marking.

The low/low-mid vowels may be indicated differently:
* = 

Dialect-specific sounds:
* : Icelandic; a, aa, á, o, ó, ǫ́; Normalized: á
* : Danish; e, æ

When dialectal mergers such as OEN monophthongization took place, regional spelling often changed to reflect this. Sometimes, both phonemes&#x27; spellings would be used, but confused.

The epenthetic vowel had different regional spellings. In East Norse it was commonly spelled as or , while in West Norse it was often spelled , just like in Iceland.

=== Manuscript spelling ===
The original Icelandic manuscripts, which are the main source of knowledge of Norse mythology, did not employ a unified system of spelling. During the Viking Age, many dialects of Old Norse were spoken. While they appear to have been mutually intelligible, the slight variances resulted in various spellings. Thus the same name might be spelled several different ways even in the original manuscripts. Letters unique to the language existed, such as a modified version of the letter Wynn called Vend that was used briefly for the sounds , , and . In particular, the length of vowels was only sporadically marked in many manuscripts and various umlauted vowels were often not distinguished from others. Another complication is that several shortcut forms for common words, syllables, and grammatical endings developed. One example is the use of the rune named &#x27; (man) for the word &#x27;. Another is the use of a special glyph for the various r-endings so common in Old Norse. These scribal abbreviations are categorized as follows:

* Suspension, truncation, or curtailment: Certain letters of the word are omitted, with the abbreviation indicated by a superscript stroke (esp. dropping a nasal), dot(s) beside the letter, or occasionally a colon. Examples: Ꝥ for þat (etc.), ū for um, hō for hón, þan̅ for þann; .kgr. for konungr, .s. for sonr.
* Contraction: The first and last letters are written, and the abbreviation is indicated by a dot or superscript stroke.
* Special signs or brevigraphs: Symbols replacing words or syllables. Examples: Tironian et (⁊) for &#x27;, ᛘ for &#x27;, syllabic et (Ꝫꝫ) in &quot; for .
* Superscript letters: Regular letters contained in the word or letters specifically for abbreviation purposes. Often with syllabic content. Examples: (&#x27;), a zig-zag shaped symbol mainly for &#x27; and &#x27; in &#x27;.

These abbreviation conventions and a majority of the signs are inherited from the Latin language itself, and were common to the Latin alphabet in other languages. However, other signs or conventions are specifically Norse, such as the &quot; zig-zag.

=== Normalized spelling ===
&quot;Normalized spelling&quot; can be used to refer to normalization in general or the standard normalization in particular. With normalized spelling, the manuscript spelling is altered to adhere to be more strict and regular. These respellings are designed to be phonemically precise rather than representative of the manuscripts. The degree of normalization may vary, but in general the text is at the end reduced to limited deviation from a regularized system, perhaps at the expense of some dialectal character.

For various reasons 19th century scholars came up with a standardized normalization of Old Norse which remains in use. It is primarily based on the so-called First Grammatical Treatise. Vowel length is marked and umlauted vowels are unambiguously represented. The standardized spelling employs a few characters that were not available in early electronic character sets, so replacements were often used. The most consequential was the use of ö instead of ǫ; the latter being present in Unicode v1.0 (1991) as U+01EA.

== Runic orthography and transcription ==

The following table associates the phonemes of the language to its orthographic representations. Vowel nasalization and length are not distinguished in the table when distinguished in neither orthography, nor is distinguished from .

*U: Unstressed

=== Transcription of Danish and Swedish runestones ===
When transcribing Old Norse texts from Danish and Swedish runestones, many scholars, but not all, use an orthography that is adapted to represent Old East Norse, the dialect of Old Norse in Denmark and Sweden. The main differences are the diphthong &quot;æi&quot; instead of &quot;ei&quot; as in &#x27; (&quot;stone&quot;) and &quot;i&quot; instead of the glide &quot;j&quot; as in &#x27; (&quot;payment&quot;). In this standard, the u-umlauted &quot;a&quot; represented by ǫ is not usually considered, but rendered as the underlying &quot;a&quot;, as in the name &#x27;. Another difference is the representation of the phoneme ʀ&quot;&#x27;, instead of simply &quot;r&quot; as in West Norse, where the &quot;ʀ&quot; phoneme merged with &quot;r&quot; earlier. However, even if they render the transcription according to the local pronunciation, the Rundata project presents personal names according to the previously mentioned standardized spelling in English translations. Here follows an example from the Orkesta Runestone (U 344):

Standardized spelling:
The rendering of Old East Norse:
But when translating into English, the standardized spelling is used:
: &quot;But Ulfr has taken three payments in England. That was the first that Tosti paid. Then Þorketill paid. Then Knútr paid.&quot;

== Modernized Icelandic spelling ==
In many modern Icelandic publications of Old Norse works, the modern Icelandic spelling is used. The orthography is essentially the same (since it was intentionally modelled after the aforementioned normalized Old Norse in the 19th century), but changes from Old Norse phonology to Icelandic phonology are incorporated in the translation that may not have been in the source text. One such difference is the insertion of u before r, when it is preceded by a consonant at the end of the word. Thus the Old Norse name Baldr comes out as Baldur in modern Icelandic. Other differences include vowel-shifts, whereby Old Norse &quot;ǫ&quot; became Icelandic &quot;ö&quot;, and Old Norse &quot;œ&quot; (&quot;oe&quot; ligature) became Icelandic &quot;æ&quot; (&quot;ae&quot; ligature). Old Norse &quot;ø&quot; corresponds in modern Icelandic to &quot;ö&quot;, as in &quot;sökkva&quot;, or to &quot;e&quot;, as in &quot;gera&quot;. There is also consonant lenition of final &quot;k&quot; and &quot;t&quot; to &quot;g&quot; and &quot;ð&quot;, e.g. &quot;mig&quot; for earlier &quot;mik&quot; and &quot;það&quot; for earlier &quot;þat&quot;. These distinct features are summarized in the table below:

== Anglicized spelling ==

For the convenience of English writers and readers the Old Norse characters not used in English are commonly replaced with English ones. This can lead to ambiguity and confusion. Diacritics may be removed (á → a, ö → o). The following character conversions also take place:

* ø → o
* œ → o, oe
* æ → ae
* þ → th
* ð → th, d, dh

Another common convention in English is to drop consonant nominative endings:

* Egill → Egil
* Yggdrasill → Yggdrasil
* Gunnarr → Gunnar
* Sveinn → Svein
* Freyr → Frey
* Hildr → Hild

Sometimes a &quot;j&quot; is dropped after &quot;ey&quot;.

* Freyja → Freya

Other quirks sometimes seen include adding a Latin -a suffix to the names of goddesses.

* Frigg → Frigga
* Iðunn → Iduna

Obviously the various permutations allow for many possible spellings for a given name.

Some authors, for example, replace &quot;þ&quot; with &quot;th&quot; and &quot;ð&quot; with &quot;th&quot;, &quot;dh&quot; or &quot;d&quot; but keep the accents; others may not replace &quot;ǫ&quot; with &quot;ö&quot; but prefer &quot;o&quot;.

Thus, in addition to the various versions below, the name of &quot;Hǫðr&quot; could come out as:

* Hod, Hoðr, Hödhr, Hödr, Höd, Höð, Hoð, etcetera

His productions included the TV series &quot;Family&quot; (1976–1980), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1976–1981), &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977–1986), &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1979–1984), &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1981–1989), &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1990–2000), &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1992–1999), &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (1996–2007), and &quot;Charmed&quot; (1998–2006). He also served as producer of &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; (1968–1973), &quot;The Rookies&quot; (1972–1976), and &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; (1997–1999).

Through his production company Spelling Television, Spelling holds the record as the most prolific television producer in American television history, with 218 producer and executive producer credits. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him the 11th-highest-earning deceased celebrity in 2009.

==Early life==
Spelling was born in Dallas, Texas. He was the son of David Spelling and Pearl Spelling (née Wald), Russian Jewish immigrants. His father worked as a tailor and changed his surname from Sperling (German for Sparrow) to Spelling after emigrating to the United States. His mother had previously been married to Sam Seltzer, who was murdered in 1911, the year before she married Spelling&#x27;s father. Spelling was the youngest of five children. He had two older brothers, Sam (1916–2001) and Daniel Spelling (1921–2009), and two older half-siblings, Max (circa 1909–?) and Becky Seltzer Giller (1910–1978).

At the age of eight, Spelling psychosomatically lost the use of his legs due to trauma caused by constant anti-semitic bullying from his schoolmates, and was confined to bed for a year. He made a full recovery.

After attending Forest Avenue High School in Dallas, he served in the United States Army Air Corps as a pilot during World War II.

Spelling later graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1949, where he was a cheerleader.

==Career==

Spelling made his first appearance as an actor in a film as Harry Williams in &quot;Vicki&quot;, directed by Harry Horner, in 1953. That same year, he appeared in the TV series &quot;I Led Three Lives&quot; and &quot;Dragnet&quot; (six episodes, 1953–55). Spelling appeared in episode 112 of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (&quot;Tennessee Bound&quot;, season 4, 1955); in &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (&quot;Breakdown&quot;, 1955); and as Weed Pindle in &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;″s season one, episode 35, &quot;The Guitar&quot; (1956). He continued to appear in films and TV (often uncredited) over 25 times by 1957, appearing briefly as an actor in 1963, 1995, and 1998 (all uncredited.)

He guest-starred in 1954 as a dogcatcher in the premiere episode of the CBS situation comedy, &quot;Willy&quot;, starring June Havoc as a young lawyer in New Hampshire, who later relocates to New York City to represent a vaudeville troupe.

Spelling sold his first script &quot;Twenty Dollar Bride&quot; to &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot; in 1956. He gained experience as a producer and additional credits as a script writer working for Four Star Television on the series &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;, which aired between 1956 and 1961. Of the 149 episodes in that series, he wrote 20 of the teleplays and produced many others. Spelling produced &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; while at Four Star. The show was the first success for Spelling and pioneered the multiple guest star format, later seen on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island.&quot; In 1965, he quit Four Star to set up his own production company with a two-year agreement with United Artists Television to produce television shows and movies.

Thomas-Spelling Productions was a television production company formed by comedian Danny Thomas and producer Aaron Spelling on April 15, 1966, as a partnership with 24 properties. Thomas continued his existing partnership, T&amp;L Productions, with Sheldon Leonard. The company adapted its name by July 18, 1966, when it announced the financial involvement of ABC with its first show, &quot;Range&quot; (later &quot;Rango&quot;), a half-hour comedy western starring Tim Conway and its rented space on Desilu Productions&#x27; Gower lot. ABC also picked up another show for a pilot, just in an outline treatment, in &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot;. Thomas-Spelling Productions&#x27; active operations ended with the last season of &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; in 1972. Spelling formed a new partnership with Leonard Goldberg, Spelling-Goldberg Productions.

Beginning in 1965, Spelling began producing successful television shows including &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (which starred his daughter Tori), &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;. Spelling founded Spelling Entertainment in 1965, alongside partnerships with comedian/actor Danny Thomas (Thomas-Spelling Productions, 1966–1972), and television/film producer Leonard Goldberg (Spelling-Goldberg Productions, 1972–1986) He produced the unsuccessful situation comedy &quot;The San Pedro Beach Bums&quot; in 1977.

In 2004, Spelling was portrayed in two television movies: Dan Castellaneta portrayed Spelling in &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and Nicholas Hammond portrayed Spelling in television movie &quot;Dynasty: The Making of a Guilty Pleasure&quot;.

==Personal life==
Spelling married actress Carolyn Jones in 1953, when he was 30 and she was 23. They divorced in 1964. He briefly dated actress Jill Haworth when he was 42 and she was 19. Spelling married the former Candy Marer in 1968 when he was 45 and she was 23. The couple had daughter Tori in 1973 and son Randy in 1978.

In 1988, Spelling bought the property of Bing Crosby&#x27;s former Los Angeles mansion. He demolished the property and built a 123-room home on the lot in 1991. Known as &quot;The Manor&quot;, it has of floor space and as of 2006 was the largest single-family home in Los Angeles. Spelling&#x27;s widow Candy listed the home for sale in 2008 for $150 million. Heiress Petra Ecclestone ultimately purchased the property for $85 million in 2011 through a brokered agreement that was developed by Brandon Davis, the brother of Jason Davis and grandson of wealthy industrialist Marvin Davis.

In 1992, Candy, Spelling&#x27;s second wife, commissioned pinball manufacturer Data East to produce a personalized table as a gift to Spelling. The game, a modified version of Data East&#x27;s &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; table, has since appeared publicly at collector&#x27;s expos.

==Legacy and death==
On September 15, 1978, Spelling was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6667 Hollywood Blvd. In 1996, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

In 1983, he was accorded the NAACP Humanitarian Award for his monetary donation that permitted a 21-year-old&#x27;s heart transplant operation.

In 2001, Spelling was diagnosed with oral cancer.

On June 23, 2006, Spelling died at The Manor, his estate in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, from complications of a stroke he suffered five days prior. He also suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A private funeral was held several days later, and Spelling was entombed in a mausoleum in Culver City&#x27;s Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

On August 27, 2006, Spelling was posthumously honored at the 58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards by former employees Joan Collins, Stephen Collins, Heather Locklear, Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith.

&quot;7th Heaven&quot;″s May 13, 2007, episode, the last before the series finale, was dedicated to Spelling. When &quot;7th Heaven&quot; ended its run, it was touted by the network as being Spelling&#x27;s longest-running series and the longest-running &quot;family drama&quot; in American television history.

<text>Woolston is a settlement and civil parish in the Borough of Warrington in the county of Cheshire, England. Formerly a township called &#x27;Woolston with Martinscroft&#x27; within the parish of Warrington, there are two main settlements: Woolston to the west and Martinscroft to the east. Formerly within the historic county of Lancashire, the parish is on the north bank of the River Mersey and takes in Paddington to the south-west. It is bounded by the River Mersey to the south, Bruche and Padgate to the west, Longbarn and Birchwood to the north and Rixton to the east.

The township remained an agricultural community on the furthest outskirts of Warrington until the 1970s, when the development of Warrington New Town radically transformed its rural character. The parish is generally known as just Woolston.

== Geography ==

A 1907 &quot;Victoria County History&quot; description reads:

The area has two main natural areas: Woolston Linear Park and the Woolston Eyes Nature Reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Woolston is in the Mersey Valley and so there is a very slight lowering in height between it and the surrounding areas. The highest point is on the Woolston Eyes, formerly Thelwall Eyes, (four-man-made areas formed by large embankments for the dispersement of dredging waste). The lowest point is the marshland formed by the dereliction of the Woolston New Cut Canal and Woolston Old Canal. The Manchester Ship Canal denotes the southerly boundary of the Eyes reserve and can be crossed either via nearby Latchford locks or by the unique penny ferry crossing (11p each way as of October 2009). Woolston has plenty of waterways including the aforementioned canals; the new cut of the River Mersey; and the Manchester Ship Canal.

== History ==

Woolston is part of the historic county of Lancashire, but after local government reforms of 1974, administratively it became part of Cheshire. Up to the last decade of the nineteenth century, Woolston and its immediate area was a township called &quot;Woolston with Martinscroft&quot; in Warrington ancient parish, which was itself part of West Derby Hundred. Towards the middle to end of the nineteenth century, it was part of Warrington rural sanitary district and Warrington poor law union.

In 1894, Woolston with Martinscroft joined the newly formed Warrington Rural District as a civil parish, where it remained until 1933. There was a boundary change to the civil parish in 1885 when the county boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire was adjusted: it gained part of Thelwall civil parish from Cheshire. A complex set of boundary changes occurred in 1933, involving the county boundary with Cheshire: the civil parish gained part of Lymm ancient parish; exchanged areas of land with Grappenhall ancient parish; and exchanged areas of land with Thelwall civil parish, all in Cheshire. Finally, and again in 1933, the civil parish of Woolston with Martinscroft was abolished and parts used to create the civil parishes of Croft and the modern day civil parish of Woolston, both in Lancashire. This new civil parish of Woolston was formed from parts of the old Woolston with Martinscroft civil parish, as explained above, and also part of Culcheth civil parish. It remained in Warrington rural district until the local government reforms of 1974 which created the borough of Warrington which was located in Cheshire. In 1998, when Warrington borough became a unitary authority, it remained in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, and continued to be served by Cheshire Police and Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service.

Throughout time its name has changed often. At time of the Vikings it was called Wulfiges Town (probably because of the wolves that occupied the land).

It is a civil parish which grew in the 20th century: the population in 1901 was just 484.

== Economy ==
A large area of the district is covered by warehousing districts. The largest by far is the &quot;Grange&quot; which is an area of modern warehousing and light manufacturing built next to the M6 motorway. This area was home to a large Safeway distribution depot that was taken over by Morrisons in January 2006, and subsequently taken over by Iceland in mid-2006. In 2007, this was outsourced to DHL, while still continuing to serve Iceland.

Woolston is home to a number of smaller businesses including Big Storage on the main A57 and Paragon Framing. There is also an industrial estate to the south called the &quot;New Cut industrial estate&quot;, this features a large pipework fabrication business (WH Capper) and several small offices and small holdings. The estate gets its name from the canal which borders it and the &quot;new cut&quot; of the River Mersey.

== Education ==
Education is provided by Woolston Church of England Primary School, St. Peters&#x27; Catholic Primary School and Woolston Community Primary School. Woolston Community Primary School has 238 pupils. The original school building was demolished in 2014 after a new school was built on the same site. There is a designated provision for children aged 7 to 11 with autism. The headteacher, Mr Toyne won the Warrington Guardian Teacher of the month in March 2015.

St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is in connection with one of many local Roman Catholic churches in the adjacent Martinscroft area, the highly rated St Peters &amp; St Michaels Church. Despite the school being one of the newer schools in the area, they still boast the best results from both Keystage 1 and Keystage 2 in the Woolston area. 
Secondary Education was provided by Woolston Community High School which closed in 2012.

King&#x27;s Leadership Academy Warrington (Warrington&#x27;s first Free School) opened its doors to its first year 7 in 2012. The school is the brainchild of Sir Iain Hall (previous career in working with failing schools in the US and the emergence of the Charter School system in the USA). Based on Seymour Drive at present, the school is set to move to its new purpose build school building soon which is set close to Woolston Park

== Places of worship ==
Woolston remained a Catholic stronghold after the Reformation, with Benedictine services being held in the chapel at Woolston Hall, until its demolition in the early 1800s. St Peter&#x27;s Church, served by secular clergy, was built on Weir Lane, Martinscroft, in 1835 and is now a Grade II listed building. It is part of the Arch-diocese of Liverpool.

A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built on Manchester Road, Martinscroft, in 1827 and demolished by the New Town Corporation in 1977. A modern replacement, St Martin&#x27;s Church, was built on Gig Lane, Woolston in 1975.

The Church of the Ascension (Church of England) on Warren Lane, Woolston, was built in 1968, from plans drawn up in 1959. It is part of the Diocese of Liverpool.

== Leisure and community ==
A Leisure Centre was built in Hall Road in 1972, as part of the New Town Development, and refurbished in 2010 and 2011 to become Woolston Neighbourhood Hub. It has good disabled access.

Swimming

There are two pools at the Leisure Centre, both open seven days a week. The Main Pool is 25 m by 12 m with a depth of 1 m to 1,7m. The Teaching Pool is 13 m by 9 m with a depth of 0.8 m to 0.9 m.

There is a swimming club, Warriors of Warrington, which caters to Juniors, Beginners, Seniors, Veterans and Disabled.

Squash

There are three squash courts at the Leisure Centre, with glass fronts for viewing.

Gym

There is a Future Fitness gym at the Leisure Centre, with sauna and steam rooms.

Cycling

A linear footpath following the old tow path of the New Cut Canal completed in 1821 to bypass a large bend in the River Mersey and part of the Irwell and Mersey Navigation.
The path starts at Paddington Bank and runs for 3 kilometres to Weir Lane, Woolston. Along the way passing Paddington Locks, Paddington Meadows Nature Reserve, Larkfield Park, The Ecology Park, Woolston Park South, Grey Mist Mere, Nottingham Close Play area, the site of Woolston Locks and ends at Woolston Weir Pool.

A number of groups have meetings at the Mission Hall (the C of E church hall) on Warren Lane:

Pre-school Playgroup

Youth Club

WRVS affiliated Over-sixties Club

Woolston Slimming Club

Woolston Ladies&#x27; Group

Woolston WI

==Sport==
A greyhound racing track was opened on 12 September 1934. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track was directly north of the Grey Mist Mere Lake and the Woolston New Cut Canal. The track described as being horseshoe shaped closed in 1937.

<doc id="276313" wikidata="Q11842209" url="?curid=276313" title="Black-fronted dotterel">
<text>The black-fronted dotterel (Charadrius melanops) is a small plover in the family Charadriidae that is found throughout much of Australia and New Zealand.

==Taxonomy==
The black-fronted dotterel was formally described in 1818 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot under the binomial name &quot;Charadrius melanops&quot;. The type locality was subsequently designated as New South Wales. The specific epithet combines the Ancient Greek &quot;melops&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; with &quot;ōps&quot; meaning &quot;face&quot;. This species was previously placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Elseyornis&quot; but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2022 found that it was embedded in a clade containing members of the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot;. The black-fronted dotterel was therefore moved back to &quot;Charadrius&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

== Description ==
As an adult, this small shorebird has an overall length of , a wingspan of and a weight of . The sexes are similar in appearance.
It has a distinct black face mask, forehead and v-shaped band across the chest. Dorsally it is a mottled brown colour with the wings and crown of the head the same colour. This colouration is particularly useful for camouflage against aerial predators. 
Orbital eye rings and the first section of the bill are red, with the latter being black at the tip. The legs are pale orange. Unlike many other wading birds, black-fronted dotterels retain the same plumage all year round. 

Juveniles are duller in colour with a greyish beak and lacking the black breast band and forehead.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The black-fronted dotterel is widespread throughout Australia including in Tasmania and self-introduced in New Zealand where it is now also common.

It inhabits the edges of freshwater sources including wetlands, lakes, swamps, dams and billabongs, and in shallow, temporary claypan pools. Occasionally, it can also be found occupying saline mudflats and estuaries. It will avoid water more than a few mm deep and heavy vegetation. Black-fronted dotterels are typically sedentary, with a single bird, a pair, or a family group occupying a stretch of habitat on a more or less permanent basis. However, some individuals appear to travel considerable distances, and flocks will sometimes congregate in food-rich areas.

==Behaviour and ecology==
=== Food and feeding ===
Their diet consists of crustaceans, insects and seeds. 
They forage in a series of short running motions, holding the body horizontal, stopping to peck from time to time with a rapid bobbing motion.

=== Breeding ===
The black-fronted dotterel breeds between August and February, although is known to breed anytime conditions are right e.g. after suitable rains in Northern Australia. During courtship, both species will call and participate in aerial displays.

The nest is a small depression that can consist of twigs, shells and pebbles. The eggs are a greyish-yellow colour with brown and lavender markings. Incubation of the 2-3 eggs is shared between both parents. When one parent is not incubating, they still rest and feed close to the nest. During incubation, if the eggs get too hot the adults will stand over the eggs to shade them from the harsh sun or wet the feathers on their stomach to wet and cool the eggs. The egg gestation period is 4–5 weeks. Twenty-four hours after they hatch the chicks leave the nest to hide in less exposed areas, while at the same time both parents look after them. Both parents will call loudly and feign injury to lure predators away from the nest.

<text>Martinscroft is a part of the civil parish of Woolston in Warrington, Cheshire, England.

It is rumoured that Battery Lane in the village got its name from where Oliver Cromwell stored his weapons during his visit in the civil war.

Martinscroft Green is the village green and is also a popular place for recreational activities.

It recently has been enlarged by new housing estates and the building of a hotel, although it has a few old cottages still along the village green.

Hidden in the trees at the back of the village green is a school gate post which is from when there was a school on the village green and also horse mounting steps which are from when there was a pub on the village green.

<text>The counties of Estonia () are the state administrative subdivisions of Estonia. Estonian territory is composed of 15 counties, including 13 on the mainland and 2 on islands. County governments () were abolished at the end of 2017, with their duties split between state authorities and local governments, and nowadays counties have no noteworthy independent competences. Counties are composed of municipalities of two types: urban municipalities or towns (), and rural municipalities or parishes (), which are by law required to cooperate in development of their county.

== List ==
As of 2023, the sum total of the figures in the table below is 42,644 km2, of which the land area is 42,388 km2, so that 256 km2 of water is included in the figures.

== History ==


In the first centuries AD, political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (kihelkond) and the county (maakond). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defence of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Osilia), Läänemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), Rävala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), Järvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia). Additionally there were several smaller elderships in central Estonia where danger of war was smallerVaiga, Mõhu, Nurmekund and Alempois. The exact number and borders of some elderships are disputed.

The first documented mentioning of Estonian political and administrative subdivisions comes from the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia, written in the 13th century during the Northern Crusades.

The autonomy of the Estonian counties and parishes ended after conquered and divided between Denmark, Livonian Order, Bishopric of Dorpat and Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek. The name of Rävala became Reval, replacing the name of an Estonian town Lindanisse, later Tallinn. Ugandi, Sakala and the smaller elderships disappeared from common usage.

In the 1580s, after the Livonian war as Sweden had conquered Northern Estonia, Harju, Järva, Lääne and Viru counties were officially formed there. Southern Estonia, which belonged to Poland 1582–1625, was divided into voivodships of Pärnu and Tartu; the island of Saaremaa belonged to Denmark until 1645. They all became counties as they went under Swedish rule.

This administrative system mostly remained as Estonia went under Russian rule due to the Great Northern War, ending circa 1721. In 1793 were formed Võru County in the south of Tartumaa, Viljandi County between Tartu and Pärnu counties, and Paldiski County in the west of Harjumaa. In 1796 Paldiski County was joined with Harjumaa again. Until 1888 Võrumaa and Viljandimaa were not wholly independent from Tartumaa and Pärnumaa, respectively.

Several changes were made to the borders of counties after Estonia became independent, most notably the formation of Valga County (from parts of Võru, Tartu and Viljandi counties) and Petseri County (area acquired from Russia with the 1920 Tartu peace treaty).

During Soviet rule, Petseri County became a part of Russia in 1945. Hiiumaa seceded from Läänemaa in 1946, Jõgevamaa from Tartumaa in 1949 and Jõhvimaa (modern Ida-Virumaa) from Virumaa in 1949. Counties were completely dissolved in 1950 as Estonian SSR was divided into raions (&quot;rajoonid&quot;) and (until 1953) oblasts. Until the 1960s, the borders of raions often changed until 15 of them were left. Out of them, Põlva and Rapla regions became separate, while the others were roughly corresponding to the pre-1950 counties.

Counties were re-established on 1 January 1990 in the borders of the Soviet-era raions. Due to the numerous differences between the current and historical (pre-1940) layouts, the historical borders are still used in ethnology, better representing cultural and linguistic differences.

County governments were abolished at the end of 2017, with their duties split between state authorities and local governments. Nowadays counties have no noteworthy independent competences, but local governments are required by law to work together in developing their county.

<doc id="276326" wikidata="Q319896" url="?curid=276326" title="Ze'ev Jabotinsky">
<text>Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky (born Vladimir Yevgenyevich Zhabotinsky; 17 October 1880  – 3 August 1940) was a Russian-born author, poet, orator, soldier, and founder of the Revisionist Zionist movement and the Jewish Self-Defense Organization in Odessa.

With Joseph Trumpeldor, he co-founded the Jewish Legion of the British Army in World War I. Later he established several Jewish organizations, including the paramilitary group Betar in Latvia, the youth movement Hatzohar and the militant organization Irgun in Mandatory Palestine.

==Early life==
Vladimir Yevgenyevich (Yevnovich) Zhabotinsky was born in Odessa, Kherson Governorate (modern Ukraine) into an assimilated Jewish family. His father, Yevno (Yevgeniy Grigoryevich) Zhabotinsky, hailed from Nikopol, Yekaterinoslav Governorate. He was a member of the Russian Society of Sailing and Trade and was primarily involved in wheat trading. His mother, Chava (Eva Markovna) Zach (1835–1926), came from Berdychiv, Kiev Governorate. Jabotinsky&#x27;s older brother Myron died when Vladimir was six months old, and his father died when he was six years old. His sister, Tereza (Tamara Yevgenyevna) Zhabotinskaya-Kopp, founded a private school for girls in Odessa. In 1885, the family moved to Germany due to his father&#x27;s illness, returning a year later after his father&#x27;s death.

Raised in a middle-class Jewish home, Jabotinsky was educated in Russian schools. Although he studied Hebrew as a child, he wrote in his autobiography that his upbringing was divorced from Jewish faith and tradition. His mother ran a stationery store in Odessa. Jabotinsky dropped out of school at the age of 17 with a guarantee of a job as a correspondent for a local Odessan newspaper, the &quot;Odesskiy Listok&quot;, and was sent to Bern and Rome as a correspondent. He also worked for the &quot;Odesskie Novosti&quot; after his return from Italy. Jabotinsky was a childhood friend of Russian journalist and poet Korney Chukovsky.

===Studies in Rome and return to Odessa===
From the autumn of 1898 onward, Jabotinsky was registered for three years as a law student at the Sapienza University of Rome, but hardly attended any classes and did not graduate, leading a bohemian lifestyle instead. In addition to Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew, he learned to speak fluent Italian.

After returning as a news reporter to Odessa, he was arrested in April 1902 for writing feuilletons in an anti-establishment tone, as well as contributing to a radical Italian journal. He was held isolated in a prison cell in the city for two months, where he communicated with other inmates through shouting and passing written notes.

In October 1907 Jabotinsky married Joanna (or Ania) Galperina.

==Early activism and militancy==
===Zionist activism in Russia===
Prior to the Kishinev pogrom of 1903, Jabotinsky joined the Zionist movement, where he soon gained a reputation as a powerful speaker and an influential leader. With more pogroms looming on the horizon, he established the Jewish Self-Defense Organization, a Jewish militant group, to safeguard Jewish communities throughout Russia. He became a source of great controversy in the Russian Jewish community as a result of these actions.

Around this time, he began learning modern Hebrew, and took a Hebrew name: &quot;Vladimir&quot; became &quot;Ze&#x27;ev&quot; (&quot;wolf&quot;). During the pogroms, he organized self-defence units in Jewish communities across Russia and fought for the civil rights of the Jewish population as a whole. His slogan was, &quot;Better to have a gun and not need it than to need it and not have it!&quot; Another slogan was, &quot;Jewish youth, learn to shoot!&quot;

In 1903, he was elected as a Russian delegate to the Sixth Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. After Theodor Herzl&#x27;s death in 1904, he became the leader of the right-wing Zionists. That year he moved to Saint Petersburg and became one of the co-editors for the Russophone magazine &quot;Yevreiskaya Zhyzn&quot; (Jewish Life), which after 1907 became the official publishing body of the Zionist movement in Russia. In the pages of the newspaper, Jabotinsky wrote fierce polemics against supporters of assimilation and the Bund.

In 1905, he was one of the co-founders of the &quot;Union for Rights Equality of Jewish People in Russia&quot;. The following year, he was one of the chief speakers at the 3rd All-Russian Conference of Zionists in Helsinki, Finland, which called upon the Jews of Europe to engage in &quot;Gegenwartsarbeit&quot; (work in the present) and to join together to demand autonomy for ethnic minorities in Russia. This liberal approach was later apparent in his position concerning the Arab citizens of the future Jewish State: Jabotinsky asserted that &quot;&quot;Each one of the ethnic communities will be recognized as autonomous and equal in the eyes of the law&quot;.&quot;

In 1909, he fiercely criticized leading members of the Russian Jewish community for participating in ceremonies marking the centennial of the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol. In light of Gogol&#x27;s antisemitic views, Jabotinsky claimed it was unseemly for Russian Jews to take part in these ceremonies, as it showed they had no Jewish self-respect.

===Representative of the ZO in the Ottoman Empire, 1908–1914===
In 1909, Sultan Abdulhamid II was deposed. The year before that, following the Young Turk Revolution, the Berlin Executive office of the Zionist Organization (ZO), sent Jabotinsky to the Ottoman capital Constantinople where he became editor-in-chief of a new pro-Young-Turkish daily newspaper &quot;Le Jeune Turc&quot; (meaning Young Turk) which was founded and financed by Zionist officials like ZO president David Wolffsohn and his representative in Constantinople Victor Jacobson. The journalists writing for that paper included the famous German Social democrat and Russian-Jewish revolutionary Alexander Parvus, who lived in Constantinople from 1910 until 1914. The &quot;Jeune Turc&quot; was prohibited in 1915 by the pro-German Turkish military junta. Richard Lichtheim, who was to become Jabotinsky&#x27;s representative in Germany in 1925, stayed in Constantinople as ZO representative and managed to keep the &quot;Yishuv&quot; (Jewish population of Palestine) out of trouble during the war years by constant diplomatic interventions with German, Turkish, and also American authorities, whose humanitarian support was crucial for the survival of the Jewish settlement project in Palestine during the war years.

==World War I military career==
During World War I, he had the idea of establishing a Jewish Legion to fight alongside the British against the Ottomans who then controlled Palestine. In 1915, together with Joseph Trumpeldor, a one-armed veteran of the Russo-Japanese War, he created the Zion Mule Corps, which consisted of several hundred Jewish men, mainly Russians who had been exiled from Palestine by the Ottoman Empire and had settled in Egypt. The unit served with distinction in the Battle of Gallipoli. When the Zion Mule Corps was disbanded, Jabotinsky traveled to London, where he continued his efforts to establish Jewish units to fight in Palestine as part of the British Army. Although Jabotinsky did not serve with the Zion Mule Corps, Trumpeldor, Jabotinsky and 120 Zion Mule Corps members did serve in Platoon 16 of the 20th Battalion of the London Regiment. In 1917, the government agreed to establish three Jewish battalions, initiating the Jewish Legion.

As an honorary lieutenant in the 38th Royal Fusiliers, Jabotinsky saw action in Palestine in 1918. His battalion was one of the first to enter Transjordan.

He was demobilised in September 1919, soon after he complained to Field Marshal Allenby about the British Army&#x27;s attitude towards Zionism and the reduction of the Jewish Legion to just one battalion. His appeals to the British government failed to reverse the decision, but in December 1919 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his service.

==Renewed activism and militancy==
===Jewish self-defense and 1920 Palestine riots===
After Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky was discharged from the British Army in September 1919, he openly trained Jews in warfare and the use of small arms. On 6 April 1920, during the 1920 Palestine riots the British searched the offices and apartments of the Zionist leadership for arms, including the home of Chaim Weizmann, and in a building used by Jabotinsky&#x27;s defense forces they found three rifles, two pistols, and 250 rounds of ammunition.
Nineteen men were arrested. The next day Jabotinsky protested to the police that he was their commander and therefore solely responsible, so they should be released. Instead, he, too, was arrested, and the nineteen were sentenced to three years in prison with Jabotinsky being given a 15-year prison term for possession of weapons, until a July 1920 general pardon was granted to both Jews and Arabs convicted in the rioting.
A committee of inquiry placed responsibility for the riots on the Zionist Commission, alleging that they provoked the Arabs. The court blamed &quot;Bolshevism&quot; claiming that it &quot;flowed in Zionism&#x27;s inner heart&quot;, and ironically identified the fiercely anti-socialist Jabotinsky with the socialist-aligned Poalei Zion (&#x27;Zionist Workers&#x27;) party, which it called &#x27;a definite Bolshevist institution.&#x27;

===Founder of the Revisionist movement===

In 1920, Jabotinsky was elected to the first Assembly of Representatives in Palestine. The following year he was elected to the executive council of the Zionist Organization. He was also a founder of the newly registered Keren haYesod and served as its director of propaganda. Jabotinsky left the mainstream Zionist movement in 1923 due to differences of opinion between him and its chairman, Chaim Weizmann, establishing a new revisionist party called Alliance of Revisionists-Zionists and its Zionist youth paramilitary organization Betar.

His new party demanded that the mainstream Zionist movement recognize as its stated objective the establishment of a Jewish state on both banks of the Jordan River. His main goal was to establish, with the help of the British Empire, a modern Jewish state in which equality of rights for its Arab minority were upheld. He maintained, however, that this could only be achieved through force, and condemned the &quot;vegetarians&quot; and &quot;peace mongers&quot; in mainstream Zionism who believed that this could be achieved peacefully.

His philosophy contrasted with that of the socialist-oriented Labor Zionists, in that it focused its economic and social policy on the ideals of the Jewish middle class in Europe. His ideal for a Jewish state was a form of nation state based loosely on the British imperial model. His support base was mostly located in Poland, and his activities focused on attaining British support to help with the development of the Yishuv. Another area of major support for Jabotinsky was Latvia, where his speeches in Russian made an impression on the largely Russian-speaking Latvian Jewish community.

Jabotinsky was both a nationalist and a liberal democrat. He rejected authoritarian notions of state authority and its imposition on individual liberty; he said that &quot;Every man is a king.&quot; He championed the notion of a free press and believed the new Jewish state would protect the rights and interests of minorities. As an economic liberal, he supported a free market with minimal government intervention, but also believed that the &quot;&#x27;elementary necessities&#x27; of the average person...: food, shelter, clothing, the opportunity to educate his children, and medical aid in case of illness&quot; should be supplied by the state.

In 1930, while he was visiting South Africa, he was informed by the British Colonial Office that he would not be allowed to return to Palestine.

=== The Revisionists, Fascism and Mussolini ===
Italy and Mussolini were a source of ideological, historical and cultural inspiration for the Zionist Revisionists of the 1920s and 1930s. From the early 1930s onwards Jabotinsky believed that the United Kingdom could no longer be trusted to advance the Zionist cause and that Italy, as a growing power capable of challenging Britain for dominance in the region, was a natural ally.

Jabotinsky set up the Betar Naval Academy, a Zionist naval training school established in Civitavecchia, Italy in 1934 with the agreement of Benito Mussolini.

=== 1930s evacuation plan ===
During the 1930s, Jabotinsky was deeply concerned with the situation of the Jewish community in Eastern Europe. In 1936, Jabotinsky prepared the so-called &quot;evacuation plan&quot;, which called for the evacuation of 1.5 million Jews from Poland, the Baltic States, Nazi Germany, Hungary and Romania to Palestine over the span of the next ten years. The plan was first proposed on 8 September 1936 in the conservative Polish newspaper Czas, the day after Jabotinsky organized a conference where more details of the plan were laid out; the emigration would take 10 years and would include 750,000 Jews from Poland, with 75,000 between age of 20–39 leaving the country each year. Jabotinsky stated that his goal was to reduce Jewish population in the countries involved, to levels that would make them disinterested in its further reduction.

The same year he toured Eastern Europe, meeting with the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Józef Beck; the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy; and Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu of Romania to discuss the evacuation plan. The plan gained the approval of all three governments but caused considerable controversy within the Jewish community of Poland, on the grounds that it played into the hands of antisemites. In particular, the fact that the &#x27;evacuation plan&#x27; had the approval of the Polish government was taken by many Polish Jews as indicating Jabotinsky had gained the endorsement of what they considered to be the wrong people.

The evacuation of Jewish communities in Poland, Hungary and Romania was to take place over a ten-year period. However, the British government vetoed it, and the Zionist Organization&#x27;s chairman, Chaim Weizmann, dismissed it. Chaim Weizmann suggested that Jabotinsky was willing to accept Madagascar as one destination for limited emigration for Jews, due to political issues involved with settlement in Palestine, and dispatches from Warsaw by British ambassador Hugh Kennard, corroborate Weizmann&#x27;s account. Two years later, in 1938, Jabotinsky allegedly stated in a speech that Polish Jews were &quot;living on the edge of the volcano&quot; and warned that the situation in Poland could drastically worsen sometime in the near future. &quot;Catastrophe is approaching. ... I see a terrible picture ... the volcano that will soon spew out its flames of extermination,&quot; he said. Jabotinsky went on to warn Jews in Europe that they should leave for Palestine as soon as possible. There is much discussion about whether or not Jabotinsky actually predicted the Holocaust. In his writings and public appearances, he warned against the dangers of an outbreak of violence against the Jewish population of Central and Eastern Europe. However, as late as August 1939, he was certain that war would be averted. The General Jewish Labour Bund ridiculed Jabotinsky and his warnings calling him a &quot;Purim General.&quot;

A study published in 2023 by Goldstein and Huri concluded that Jabotinsky never made the 1938 speech attributed to him. Although Jabotinsky gave a speech on that day, the text was different. The earliest mention of the alleged prophetic content that Goldstein and Huri could locate was published in 1958 by the same associate of Jabotinsky who had published the original text in 1938, possibly to bolster the campaign to relocate Jabotinsky&#x27;s remains to Israel.

On the anniversary of Tisha B&#x27;Av (August 1938), Jabotinsky said:

It is already three years that I am calling upon you, Polish Jewry, who are the crown of world Jewry. I continue to warn you incessantly that a catastrophe is coming closer. I became grey and old in these years. My heart bleeds, that you, dear brothers and sisters, do not see the volcano which will soon begin to spit its all-consuming lava. I see that you are not seeing this because you are immersed and sunk in your daily worries. Today, however, I demand from you trust. You were convinced already that my prognoses have already proven to be right. If you think differently, then drive me out of your midst! However, if you do believe me, then listen to me in this 12th hour:In the name of God! Let anyone of you save himself as long as there is still time. And time there is very little…and what else I would like to say to you in this day of Tisha B’Av: whoever of you will escape from the catastrophe, he or she will live to see the exalted moment of a great Jewish wedding: the rebirth and the rise of a Jewish state. I don’t know if I will be privileged to see it; my son will! I believe in this as I am sure that tomorrow morning the sun will rise.

===1939 plan for a revolt against the British===
In 1939, Britain enacted the MacDonald White Paper, in which Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be restricted to 75,000 for the next five years, after which further Jewish immigration would depend on Arab consent. In addition, land sales to Jews were to be restricted, and Palestine would be cultivated for independence as a binational state.

Jabotinsky reacted by proposing a plan for an armed Jewish revolt in Palestine. He sent the plan to the Irgun High Command in six coded letters. Jabotinsky proposed that he and other &quot;illegals&quot; would arrive by boat in the heart of Palestine – preferably Tel Aviv – in October 1939. The Irgun would ensure that they successfully landed and escaped, by whatever means necessary. They would then occupy key centers of British power in Palestine, chief among them Government House in Jerusalem, raise the Jewish national flag, and fend off the British for at least 24 hours whatever the cost. Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would then declare an independent Jewish state and would function as a provisional government-in-exile. Although Irgun commanders were impressed by the plan, they were concerned over the heavy losses they would doubtless incur in carrying it out. Avraham Stern proposed simultaneously landing 40,000 armed young immigrants in Palestine to help launch the uprising. The Polish government supported his plan, and it began training Irgun members and supplying them arms. Irgun submitted the plan for the approval of its commander David Raziel, who was imprisoned by the British. However, the beginning of World War II in September 1939 quickly put an end to these plans.

On 12 May 1940, Jabotinsky offered Winston Churchill the support of a 130,000 strong Jewish volunteer corps to fight the Nazis; he also proposed Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion the creation of a united front for policy and relief.

==Literary career==
In 1898, Jabotinsky was sent to Rome as a correspondent for &quot;Odessky Listok,&quot; writing columns under the pen name &quot;V. Egal, &quot;Vl. Egal&quot; &quot;V.E.&quot; for more than a year. His first application for a job at &quot;Odesskiya Novosti&quot; was turned down, but after the editor, J.M. Heifetz, saw his writing for &quot;Odessky Listok,&quot; he hired him. At that point, Jabotinsky changed his pen name to &quot;Altalena,&quot; which he confesses was a mistake. He thought the Italian word meant &quot;elevator,&quot; but explained to the editor that the real meaning, &quot;swing,&quot; suited him well, since he was &quot;&#x27;by no means stable or constant&#x27;, but rather rocking and balancing.&quot;
In 1914, Jabotinsky published the first Hebrew translation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poems &quot;The Raven&quot; and &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;.

From 1923, Jabotinsky was editor of the revived Jewish weekly &quot;Rassvet&quot; (Dawn), published first in Berlin, then in Paris. Besides his journalistic work, he published novels under his previous pseudonym Altalena; his historical novel &quot;Samson Nazorei&quot; (Samson the Nazirite, 1927), set in Biblical times, describes Jabotinsky&#x27;s ideal of an active, daring, warrior form of Jewish life. His novel &quot;Pyatero&quot; (&quot;The Five&quot;, written 1935, published 1936 in Paris) has been described as &quot;a work that probably has the truest claim to being the great Odessa novel. ... It contains poetic descriptions of early-twentieth-century Odessa, with nostalgia-tinged portraits of its streets and smells, its characters and passions.&quot; Although it was little noticed at the time, it has received renewed appreciation for its literary qualities at the start of the twenty-first century, being reprinted in Russia and Ukraine and in 2005 translated into English (the first translation into a Western language).

==Family==

While in Odessa, Jabotinsky married Joanna (or Ania) Galperina [1884-1949] in October 1907. They had one child, Eri Jabotinsky (1910-1969), who later became a member of the Irgun-affiliated Bergson Group. Eri Jabotinsky briefly served in the 1st Knesset of Israel; he died on 6 June 1969 age 58 -one year younger than his father had been when he died at the age of 59.

==Death and burial==

Jabotinsky died of a heart attack shortly before midnight on 3 August 1940, while he was visiting a Jewish self-defense camp run by Betar in Hunter, New York.

Jabotinsky was buried in New Montefiore Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York, in accordance with a clause of his will. Ben-Gurion refused to allow Jabotinsky to be reburied in Israel. By order of Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol and in accordance with a second clause of his will, the remains of Jabotinsky and his wife were reburied at Mount Herzl Cemetery in Jerusalem in 1964. A monument to Jabotinsky was erected at his original burial site in New York.

==Views and opinions==

According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, documents show that Jabotinsky favored the idea of the transfer of Arab populations out of the proposed state if required for its establishment. Jabotinsky&#x27;s other writings state, &quot;we do not want to eject even one Arab from either the left or the right bank of the Jordan River. We want them to prosper both economically and culturally. We envision the regime of Jewish Palestine [&quot;Eretz Israel ha-Ivri&quot;, or the &#x27;Jewish Land of Israel&#x27;] as follows: most of the population will be Jewish, but equal rights for all Arab citizens will not only be guaranteed, they will also be fulfilled.&quot; In 1927, he reacted angrily to a published report that he had called for the expulsion of Arabs from Palestine. In a letter to the Zionist newspaper &quot;Haolam,&quot; he wrote: &quot;I never said that, or anything that could be interpreted in this sense. My position is, on the contrary, that no one will expel from the Land of Israel its Arab inhabitants, either all or a portion of them -- this is, first of all, immoral, and secondly, impossible.&quot; Jabotinsky was convinced that there was no way for the Jews to regain any part of Palestine without opposition from the Arabs. In 1934, he wrote a draft constitution for the Jewish state which declared that Arabs would be on an equal footing with their Jewish counterparts &quot;throughout all sectors of the country&#x27;s public life.&quot; The two communities would share the state&#x27;s duties, both military and civil service, and enjoy its prerogatives. Jabotinsky proposed that Hebrew and Arabic should enjoy equal status, and that &quot;in every cabinet where the prime minister is a Jew, the vice-premiership shall be offered to an Arab and vice versa.&quot;

Jabotinsky viewed Zionism as a complete cultural departure from the Jewish way of life in Europe and saw the new &quot;Hebrew&quot; as a radical redefinition of the Jewish culture and values at the time. In 1905 he wrote:To imagine what a true Hebrew is, to picture his image in our minds, we have no example from which to draw. Instead, we must use the method of &quot;ipcha mistavra&quot; (Aramaic for deriving something from its opposite): We take as our starting point the &quot;Yid&quot; (used here as pejorative for Jew) of today, and try to imagine in our minds his exact opposite. Let us erase from that picture all the personality traits that are so typical of a &quot;Yid,&quot; and let us insert into it all the desirable traits whose absence is so typical in him. Because the &quot;Yid&quot; is ugly, sickly, and lacks handsomeness (הדרת פנים) we shall endow the ideal image of the Hebrew with masculine beauty, stature, massive shoulders, vigorous movements, bright colors, and shades of color. The &quot;Yid&quot; is frightened and downtrodden; the Hebrew ought to be proud and independent. The &quot;Yid&quot; is disgusting to all; the Hebrew should charm all. The &quot;Yid&quot; has accepted submission; the Hebrew ought to know how to command. The &quot;Yid&quot; likes to hide with bated breath from the eyes of strangers; the Hebrew, with brazenness and greatness, should march ahead to the entire world, look them straight and deep in their eyes and hoist them his banner: “I am a Hebrew!”

His views were adopted by some Zionist publications, including &quot;Cahiers du Bétar&quot;, a monthly in Tunisia.

<text>Anna Helene Paquin ( ; born 24 July 1982) is a New Zealand actress. She made her acting debut in the romantic drama film &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at age 11, becoming the second-youngest winner in Oscar history. As a child actress, she had roles in &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; (1996), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1996), &quot;Amistad&quot; (1997), &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; (1997), and &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot; (1999), as well as in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s comedy drama film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000).

Paquin continued to perform prominent roles into adulthood, portraying Rogue in the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise (2000–2006; 2014). Her other film credits include &quot;25th Hour&quot; (2002), &quot;Trick &#x27;r Treat&quot; (2007), &quot;Margaret&quot; (2011), &quot;The Good Dinosaur&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Irishman&quot; (2019). She played the lead role of Sookie Stackhouse in the HBO vampire drama television series &quot;True Blood&quot; (2008–2014), for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 2009. Among other accolades, Paquin was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her work in the television film &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (2007), in addition to a further Golden Globe nomination for her work in the television film &quot;The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler&quot; (2009).

== Early life ==
Paquin was born on 24 July 1982 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Her father, Brian Paquin, is a Canadian retired physical education teacher, and her mother, Mary (), is a New Zealand teacher of English from Wellington. Paquin is the youngest of three children, with a brother and a sister. Her father is of Dutch and French descent. Paquin has stated that all her maternal great-grandparents emigrated to New Zealand from Ireland due to the Great Famine.

In 1986, the family moved to Wellington, where Paquin would attend Raphael House Rudolf Steiner School, Hutt Intermediate School and Wellington Girls&#x27; College. Her parents divorced when she was 12 years old. After moving to the United States at the age of 16, Paquin attended Windward School, where she graduated in 2000. Paquin studied for one year at Columbia College, where she lived in Carman Hall, and subsequently dropped out to continue her acting career. She holds dual New Zealand and Canadian citizenship.

== Career ==

Director Jane Campion was looking for a little girl to play a main role in &quot;The Piano&quot;, set to film in New Zealand, and a newspaper advertisement was run announcing an open audition. Paquin&#x27;s sister read the ad and went to try out with a friend; this inspired Paquin to audition. When Campion met Paquin—whose only acting experience had been as a skunk in a school play—she was very impressed with the nine-year-old&#x27;s performance of the monologue about Flora&#x27;s father, and she was chosen from among the 5000 candidates. When &quot;The Piano&quot; was released in 1993 it was lauded by critics, won prizes at a number of film festivals, and eventually became a popular film among a wide audience. Paquin&#x27;s debut performance in the film earned her the 1994 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the age of 11, making her the second-youngest Oscar winner in history, behind Tatum O&#x27;Neal.

&quot;The Piano&quot; was made as a small independent film and was not expected to be widely known, and Paquin and her family did not plan to continue to pursue acting. However, she was invited to the William Morris Agency, and she kept receiving offers for new roles. She systematically rejected them, but she did appear in three commercials for the phone company MCI in 1994. She later made a series of television commercials for Manitoba Telecom Systems in her birth city of Winnipeg. She also appeared as a voice in an audiobook entitled &quot;The Magnificent Nose&quot; in 1994. In 1996, she appeared in two films. The first role was as young Jane in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. The other was a lead part in &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; playing a young girl who, after her mother dies, moves in with her father and finds solace in taking care of orphaned goslings. As a teenager, she had roles in other films, including &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;, &quot;Amistad&quot;, &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; and &quot;Almost Famous&quot; as well as the English dub of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;.

Paquin played the mutant superhero Rogue in the Marvel Comics movie &quot;X-Men&quot; in 2000, its sequel &quot;X2&quot; in 2003, and its third installment, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, in 2006. Between 2006 and 2007, she starred in, as well as executive-produced &quot;Blue State&quot;. The film is made by &quot;Paquin Films&quot;, a production company formed by her and her brother, Andrew. In November 2006, she completed the film &quot;Margaret&quot;, which was released in 2011. She played Elaine Goodale in HBO&#x27;s made-for-TV film &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, based on Dee Brown&#x27;s best-seller, garnering a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. In 2007, she played the role of Laurie in the horror film &quot;Trick &#x27;r Treat&quot;, which was released in 2009.

Paquin was cast as waitress Sookie Stackhouse in the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot; in 2008, her first role in a TV series. The show is based on &quot;The Southern Vampire Mysteries&quot; series of novels by Charlaine Harris, set in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana. The series saw Paquin doing nude scenes for the first time. While working on &quot;True Blood&quot;, she started dating co-star Stephen Moyer and later married him in 2010. In 2009, Paquin played Irena Sendler, a Polish woman hailed as a heroine of the Holocaust, in &quot;The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler&quot;, a CBS TV film biographical film based on the book &quot;Mother of the Children of the Holocaust: The Irena Sendler Story&quot;, by Anna Mieszkowska. The film was made in Latvia, and was a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation for the network.

In 2010, Paquin&#x27;s film &quot;The Romantics&quot;, a romantic comedy with Josh Duhamel and Katie Holmes, was released in the US at selected cinemas in September. She played a cameo role in &quot;Scream 4&quot;, alongside Kristen Bell in 2011. She also played the voice of Kristin on an episode of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;. Paquin reprised her role as Rogue in the 2014 film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, but most of her scenes were cut out for the theatrical release. An alternative version of the film with all of Paquin&#x27;s scenes reinstated was released as &quot;The Rogue Cut&quot; on 14 July 2015. Paquin voiced Ramsey in Disney•Pixar&#x27;s film &quot;The Good Dinosaur&quot;. She also played Nancy Holt, the wife of a Confederate soldier, in the 2016 miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;.

In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Paquin and others told the stories of the people killed there. Later in 2017 Paquin starred in television series &quot;Bellevue&quot;, also being the executive producer, and acted as Nancy Montgomery in the television miniseries &quot;Alias Grace&quot;. In 2018, she acted in husband Stephen Moyer&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;The Parting Glass&quot;, and in Laurie Collyer&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;Furlough&quot;.

In 2019, Paquin appeared in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s critically acclaimed drama, &quot;The Irishman&quot;. That year, she also produced and starred as Robyn in television series &quot;Flack&quot; and appeared in the television series &quot;The Affair&quot;. In 2021, she portrayed the wife of Kurt Warner in the biographical Christian sports film, &quot;American Underdog&quot;.

In 2022, Paquin starred in &quot;A Friend of the Family&quot; for Peacock.

In 2023, Paquin starred in Netflix Original &quot;True Spirit&quot; alongside Teagan Croft and Cliff Curtis. The movie is based on the journey of Jessica Watson, an Australian sailor who attempted solo global circumnavigation at 16 years old, with Paquin playing her mother.

== Personal life ==

On 5 August 2009, Paquin announced her engagement to her &quot;True Blood&quot; co-star Stephen Moyer, whom she had been dating since filming the series pilot in 2007. They married on 21 August 2010 at a private residence in Malibu, California. Paquin gave birth to fraternal twins on 12 September 2012. She has a stepson and a stepdaughter through her marriage to Moyer. The couple reside in Venice, California and visit New Zealand yearly to see Paquin&#x27;s family.

In 2010, Paquin came out as bisexual in a public service announcement for the Give a Damn campaign as part of the True Colors Fund, an advocacy group organised by Cyndi Lauper dedicated to LGBT equality. The video features Anna Paquin stating, &quot;I&#x27;m Anna Paquin. I&#x27;m bisexual, and I give a damn.&quot; When asked about her participation in the video, Paquin said her sexuality hadn&#x27;t been a secret but that she hadn&#x27;t &quot;ever had an opportunity to speak out about [it] in a way that would be useful. Obviously I know that one person&#x27;s voice doesn&#x27;t necessarily do that much, but I just wanted to do my bit.&quot; In May 2012, in an &quot;Us Weekly&quot; interview Paquin rejected the notion that bisexuality is a choice. &quot;My sexuality is not made up, for a bisexual, it&#x27;s not about gender. That&#x27;s not the deciding factor to who they&#x27;re attracted to,&quot; stated Paquin. In 2014, she described herself on Twitter as &quot;Proud to be a happily married bisexual mother&quot;.

Paquin also supports other charities and foundations such as the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Elton John AIDS Foundation, and The Art of Elysium.

<text>Jennifer Ann Agutter (born 20 December 1952) is an English actress. She began her career as a child actress in 1964, appearing in &quot;East of Sudan&quot;, &quot;Star!&quot;, and two adaptations of &quot;The Railway Children&quot;: the BBC&#x27;s 1968 television serial and the 1970 film version. In 1971 she also starred in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Walkabout&quot; and the TV film &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;, for which she won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama.

She relocated to the United States in 1974 to pursue a Hollywood career and subsequently appeared in &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976), &quot;Amy&quot; (1981), &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981), and &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot; (1990). During the same period, Agutter continued appearing in high-profile British films, such as &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976), &quot;Equus&quot; (1977)—for which she won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role—and &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; (1979). In 1981, she co-starred in &quot;The Survivor&quot;, an Australian adaptation of the James Herbert novel by that name, and was nominated for an AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

After returning to Britain in the early 1990s to pursue family life, Agutter shifted her focus to television, appearing in the 2000 version of television adaptation of &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, this time as the mother, and since 2012 she has had an ongoing role in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;. Her film work in recent years includes &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) and &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014), and in 2022, Agutter returned to the world of &quot;The Railway Children&quot; once more by reprising her role from the 1970 film 52 years later in a sequel, &quot;The Railway Children Return&quot;.

Agutter is married, and has one adult son. She supports several charitable causes, mostly ones related to cystic fibrosis, a condition from which her niece suffers, and for her service to those causes was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours.

==Early life==
Agutter was born on 20 December 1952 in Taunton, Somerset, England. She is the daughter of Derek Agutter (an entertainments manager in the British Army) and Catherine, and was raised Roman Catholic. She has Irish ancestry on her mother&#x27;s side. As a child, she lived in Singapore, Dhekelia (Cyprus) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaya). She attended Elmhurst Ballet School, a boarding school, from ages eight to sixteen.

==Career==
===Television and film===

Agutter became known to television audiences for her role in the twice-weekly BBC series &quot;The Newcomers&quot;. (She played Kirsty, the daughter of the new managing director of Eden Brothers, the fictional firm that is at the centre of the series.) Agutter could appear only during school holidays. At this stage of her career, she was listed in credits as “Jennifer”. In 1966, she portrayed a ballet pupil in Disney&#x27;s film &quot;Ballerina&quot;. In 1968, she was featured in the lavish big-budget 20th Century Fox film musical &quot;Star!&quot; which featured Julie Andrews as Gertrude Lawrence; Agutter played Lawrence&#x27;s neglected daughter Pamela. Later, she played Roberta in a BBC adaptation of &quot;The Railway Children&quot; (1968) and in Lionel Jeffries&#x27;s 1970 film of the book. She followed this with a more serious role in the thriller &quot;I Start Counting&quot; (1969). She also won an Emmy as supporting actress for her television role as Fritha in a British television adaptation of &quot;The Snow Goose&quot; (1971).

Agutter then moved into adult roles, beginning with &quot;Walkabout&quot; (1971), in which she played a teenage schoolgirl who is lost with her younger brother in the Australian outback. She auditioned for the role in 1967, but funding problems delayed filming until 1969. The delay meant Agutter was sixteen at the time of filming, which allowed the director to include nude scenes. Among them was a five-minute skinny-dipping scene, which was cut from the original US release. She said at the 2005 Bradford Film Festival at the National Media Museum that she was shocked by the film&#x27;s explicitness, but remained on good terms with director Nicolas Roeg.

Agutter moved to Hollywood at twenty-one and appeared in a number of films over the next decade, including &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976), &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976), &quot;Equus&quot; (1977) (for which she won a BAFTA as Best Supporting Actress), &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981), and an adaptation of the James Herbert novel &quot;The Survivor&quot; (1981). Agutter has commented that the innocence of the characters she played in her early films, combined with the costumes and nudity in later adult roles such as &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;Equus&quot;, and &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, are &quot;perfect fantasy fodder&quot;.

In 1990, Agutter returned to the UK to concentrate on family life and her focus shifted towards British television. During the 1990s, she was cast in an adaptation of Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s novel &quot;Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less&quot; and as the scandalous Idina Hatton in the BBC miniseries &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;, inspired by Edith Wharton&#x27;s unfinished 1938 book, and made guest appearances in television series such as &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. In 2000, she starred in a third adaptation of &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, produced by Carlton TV, this time playing the mother. Since then Agutter has had recurring roles in several television series including &quot;Spooks&quot;, &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, &quot;Monday Monday&quot; and &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot;. In 2012 Agutter resumed her Hollywood career, appearing as a member of the World Security Council in the blockbuster film &quot;The Avengers&quot;; she reprised her role in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014). Since 2012, Agutter has played Sister Julienne in the BBC television drama series &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;.

===Theatre===
Agutter has appeared in numerous theatre productions since her stage debut in 1970, including stints at the National Theatre in 1972–73, the title role in a derivation of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; at the Roundhouse in 1980 and with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1982–83, playing Alice in Arden of Faversham, Regan in King Lear and Fontanelle in Lear. In 1987–88, Agutter played the role of Pat Green in the Broadway production of the Hugh Whitemore play &quot;Breaking the Code&quot;, about computer pioneer Alan Turing. In 1995 she was in an RSC production of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; staged in Tokyo. She is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children in the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.

===Audio===
In 2008, she also guest-starred in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;The Bride of Peladon&quot; and played an outlawed scientist in &quot;The Minister of Chance&quot;. She has appeared as a guest star character (&quot;Fiona Templeton&quot;) in the Radio 4 comedy &quot;Ed Reardon&#x27;s Week&quot;.

===Music===
Agutter appears on the 1990 Prefab Sprout song &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, speaking the words &quot;I want to have you&quot;.

==Personal life==
At a 1989 arts festival in Bath, Somerset, Agutter met Johan Tham, a Swedish hotelier who was a director of Cliveden Hotel in Buckinghamshire. They married in August 1990, and their son Jonathan was born on 25 December 1990. Agutter lives in London, but has a keen interest in Cornwall and once owned a second home there on the Trelowarren Estate, in one of the parishes on the Lizard peninsula.
She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours, for her charitable services.

Agutter has been attached to several causes throughout her career. She has been involved in raising awareness of the illness cystic fibrosis, which she believes was responsible for the deaths of two of her siblings. Her niece has the disease. At Agutter&#x27;s suggestion, an episode of &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; focused on cystic fibrosis. She has also worked in support of charities, in particular the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, of which she is a patron (she is also a carrier of the genetic mutation).

==Politics==

In August 2014, Agutter was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September 2014&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<text>A Derny is a motorized bicycle for motor-paced cycling events such as during six-day and Keirin racing and motor-paced road races. Some riders train behind a derny on the road. The Derny is so-called as it was originally produced by the French Derny firm, but the name &quot;Derny&quot; is now applied to all small cycle-pacing vehicles, regardless of manufacturer.

==The original Derny==
The first Derny &#x27;Entraineur&#x27; or &#x27;Bordeaux–Paris&#x27; moped, with its petrol tank mounted ahead of the handlebars, was built by &quot;Roger Derny et Fils&quot; of the Avenue de St Mandé, Paris, France, in 1938. A fleet of Dernys was maintained for the long-established &#x27;Bordeaux-Paris&#x27; road-race and the Derny was used for many other track and road events and for endurance training. Derny also built a touring adaptation called the &#x27;Solo&#x27; and tandems and mopeds.

Being a moped, the Derny had both a Zurcher two-stroke engine and pedals on a chainring sprocket, typically with 70 teeth on the front and 11 on the rear-wheel sprocket. The combination allows for smooth acceleration and slowing, important when the rider taking pace is only centimetres from the Derny&#x27;s rear wheel. A freewheel coupling between the motor and the back wheel ensures the derny will not stop dead if the motor seizes. Top speed, with rider pedalling, is up to , depending on gearing. 
The firm closed in 1957, after an unsuccessful venture with the &#x27;Taon&#x27;, a Roger Tallon-designed motorcycle. Another company, Service Derny, of Rue Picpus, Paris, serviced and rebuilt machines into the 1970s.

==Dernys today==
According to the Larousse dictionary, the name, &quot;derny&quot; has become a generic term for a small pacing motorcycle used in cycle races, and is now applied to all small cycle-pacing vehicles, regardless of manufacturer. There have been several attempts to copy or improve the original. One, the Burdin, was briefly used, but proved neither durable nor fast enough for repeated high-speed riding on the steep tracks used in six-day racing. Modern machines are made by a small company in Neerpelt, Belgium, and dernys are either new or have the original frames with new engines.

Dernys are usually bump-started. They can then pace riders up to , although races rarely exceed . 

Another type of pacer is the Stayer. The rider sits close to the back in an upright position to provide an envelope of low wind resistance for the cyclist drafting or slipstreaming behind. Also a roller is added behind the rear of the stayer as safety feature in case the rider bumps into it, and normally the cyclist rides on a bicycle with a slightly smaller front wheel. The photo of the Triumph motorcycle is such a stayer.

For most derny races, the cyclist sits in the slipstream for the duration of the event. In keirin races, common in Japan and familiar elsewhere, the derny brings riders up to speed then pulls off the track and the race finishes in a sprint without the pacer.

A small group of semi-professional pacers travels around Europe for the winter six-day season. Several are in their 60s and 70s and some have been pacing for more than 40 years.

In most of its later history, the Bordeaux–Paris classic road race was motor-paced using dernys from half-distance. Other important races on the road behind dernys have included the Critérium des As in Paris.

<text>Monica Anna Maria Bellucci (; born 30 September 1964) is an Italian actress and model who began her career as a fashion model before working in Italian, American, and French films. She has an eclectic filmography in a range of genres and languages, and her accolades include the David di Donatello, Globo d&#x27;oro and Nastro d&#x27;Argento awards. In 2018, &quot;Forbes Italy&quot; included her in their list of the 100 most successful Italian women.

Bellucci was represented by Elite Model Management and modelled for Dolce &amp; Gabbana campaigns. She made her acting debut in the Italian television miniseries (1991); she went on to play one of Dracula&#x27;s brides in the horror film &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992) and then enrolled in acting classes. After appearing in Italian productions, she had her breakthrough role in &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1996), for which she received a César Award nomination for Most Promising Actress. Bellucci came to the attention of American audiences in &quot;Under Suspicion&quot; (2000) and gained greater international recognition as in (2000). Bellucci starred in the period horror &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (2001) and the comedy &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot; (2002). She portrayed a rape victim in the controversial thriller (2002), and Persephone in the 2003 science-fiction films &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;.

Bellucci was praised for her portrayal of Mary Magdalene in the drama &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004).

Bellucci made her stage debut in 2019 as Maria Callas in &quot;Letters and Memoirs&quot;. She also played Delores in &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; (2024).

Bellucci starred alongside her second husband Vincent Cassel in on-screen partnerships that spanned ten years. She has remained involved in modelling, and worked as a brand ambassador for luxury brands such as Cartier and Dior. Some media outlets have labelled Bellucci a sex symbol. Bellucci received the knight insignias of the Order of Arts and Letters in 2006 and of the Legion of Honour in 2016. She represents Italy as a permanent member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

==Early life==
Monica Anna Maria Bellucci was born in , Umbria, Italy, on 30 September 1964. Her father Pasquale Bellucci owned a trucking company, and her mother Brunella Briganti was a housewife and amateur painter. Bellucci was the only child in her family since her parents did not want another one. Bellucci grew up in , in the (municipality) of San Giustino on the banks of the Tiber River.

Bellucci received a Catholic education. She was an &quot;intelligent child&quot;. According to her father, she was discreet and increasingly interested in fashion, and grew up &quot;surrounded by love&quot;. Bellucci was introduced to modelling at age 13 when she posed for a photographer friend-of-the-family in . She was distant from other children her age, regularly made detours to get home after school, and did not spend time with them in the &#x27;s public space. Bellucci&#x27;s father said she complained that everyone stared at her. Her father helped her gain self-confidence.

Bellucci developed a taste for cinema, watching films by Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, , and Jean-Luc Godard. Bellucci has said her personality largely reflects her upbringing: &quot;Certainly a lot of positivity also depends on the climate in which my parents raised me&quot;.

==Modelling career==
===1980s and 1990s===

At age 16, Monica Bellucci was asked to pose for photography sessions by her father&#x27;s friend, the director of a fashion agency. Having begun her modelling career, Bellucci periodically travelled to Milan and Paris while continuing her studies at . According to Bellucci: &quot;I approached the adult universe very early&quot; because she worked with models ten years older than herself. Bellucci said: &quot;Modelling came to me naturally, and I loved pictures. I loved the world of image&quot;.

While hitchhiking, Bellucci met Piero Montanucci, a hairdresser from , who persuaded her to become his model. Bellucci, a student at the , attracted attention wherever they went due to her striking appearance. She was considered a local model. Bellucci studied philosophy, literature, Latin and Greek. In 1983, Bellucci was dressed by -based fashion entrepreneur Pina Alberti and modelled at a fashion show at the , the city&#x27;s municipal theatre, as part of an event called Momento Donna, which Maria Giovanna Elmi hosted. Montanucci, her mentor at the time, accompanied Bellucci to the event. While in high school, Bellucci&#x27;s father&#x27;s friend allowed her to debut on the catwalk during a fashion show in Florence and at another in Milan.

Bellucci studied law at the University of Perugia, aiming to become a lawyer. She financed her studies by working as a model through her father&#x27;s friend. After a friend of Bellucci encouraged her to apply to modelling agencies during her studies, she moved to Milan, one of Europe&#x27;s fashion centres. Modelling agent Piero Piazzi saw Bellucci&#x27;s arrival at the Elite Model Management agency and thought she could have been an actress. Piazzi had been critical in his assessment when he first saw Bellucci in 1987, telling her she was &quot;not ready&quot;. Between 1988 and 1989, Elite signed Bellucci to a contract. In 1988, she featured on the cover of , photographed by Oliviero Toscani, and &quot;Vogue Spain&quot;.

Bellucci&#x27;s work as a model for Elite required her to travel so she decided to leave university; she later said being a lawyer would not have suited her. She appeared in numerous international advertising campaigns, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana recruited her as their muse. Bellucci&#x27;s physical attributes aligned with the image the founders of Dolce &amp; Gabbana wanted to portray. In 1989, Bellucci lived in New York and was already a millionaire. As a model, Bellucci was represented by Elite, and she worked in Milan, Paris, and New York.

In 1990, the French luxury house Dior used Bellucci&#x27;s image and name for its line. She was photographed by Richard Avedon, and became the &quot;protagonist&quot; of Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s campaigns, &quot;which elevated her to an icon of Mediterranean beauty&quot;. She also appeared in fashion parades for the luxury fashion house Fendi. In 1991, Bellucci was the brand ambassador for the cosmetics company L&#x27;Oréal. The same year, Bellucci appeared in the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue, which featured photographs of her in the Caribbean. Bellucci also appeared in advertisements for Givenchy, Nina Ricci, Yves Saint Laurent, Versace and other luxury brands. In 1992, Bellucci combined her work as a model with her acting debut. In 1993, she first met Giuseppe Tornatore when he directed her in a television advertisement for Dolce &amp; Gabbana perfume.

Bellucci opted to follow her passion for cinema, turned to acting and stopped modelling full-time, although she remained active in the industry. The Italian luxury company Breil appointed Bellucci its brand ambassador and she starred in advertising campaigns. In the 1990s, Bellucci regularly modelled for calendars, beginning in 1997 at the age of 33 when Avedon photographed her for the Pirelli Calendar. In 1997, Bellucci became the brand ambassador and muse of Cartier jewellery. Nina Hald of the Danish newspaper &quot;Berlingske&quot; said: &quot;Cartier chose for the first time to associate an actress closely with the house&quot;. Cartier accompanied Bellucci throughout her acting career, notably on red carpets, where she wore (high jewellery) collections, and she worked as a model for opulent creations. Italian fashion photographer Fabrizio Ferri photographed Bellucci for the magazine &quot;Max&quot; calendar.

===2000s===
Monica Bellucci posed for the &quot;GQ&quot; calendar in 2000 and was photographed by Gian Paolo Barbieri. In 2004, while pregnant with her first child, Bellucci posed nude for the Italian cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in a protest against Italian laws that restricted access to in vitro fertilisation. That same year, Bellucci&#x27;s status as the only actress who was contractually bound to Cartier was made public. In 2006, she was named brand ambassador for Dior and the face of a range of products until 2010. Cartier designed a collection of luxury diamond jewellery that was inspired by Bellucci and bore her name. It was first presented at a Cartier event in Dubai in 2007.

===2010s and 2020s===
Monica Bellucci&#x27;s appearances in television advertisements include Martini Gold, a collaboration between Martini and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, in 2010.

==Acting career==
===1990–1999: Early roles and breakthrough===
In 1990, Italian director Carlo Vanzina noticed a photo of Monica Bellucci in a magazine and recommended her to Dino Risi, who was looking for a &quot;new face&quot; for his television miniseries . Bellucci had never thought of becoming an actress and was surprised to be chosen for a role. Bellucci made her acting debut in &quot;Vita coi figli&quot;, a two-part television film that was broadcast in Italy in May 1991, in which she played Elda. The same year, Bellucci made her film debut in , which Francesco Laudadio directed.

In 1992, Bellucci played one of the three brides of Dracula in the horror film &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. Roman Coppola saw a photograph of Bellucci in the Italian magazine &quot;Zoom&quot; and implored his father Francis Ford to offer her a film role. Francis Ford Coppola arranged a meeting with Bellucci in Los Angeles while she was in New York for a photography session. After talking with Coppola, Bellucci realised she would embark on an acting career. At Coppola&#x27;s request, Bellucci stayed in Los Angeles during filming; she was apprehensive about the city and believed her English needed improvement. She decided her next acting work would be in Italy. Bellucci&#x27;s role as a &quot;sensual vampire&quot; was her international film debut.

Following her minor role in &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, Bellucci returned to Italy and enrolled in acting classes. According to Bellucci: &quot;I craved it ... I needed to act&quot;. Bellucci said a time when all of her friends were leaving the faculty was a challenging time. Bellucci had difficulty overcoming the prejudices related to her modelling and her physical appearance, and had to work to establish her credibility. For the next four years, Bellucci starred in Italian films but was ultimately dissatisfied due to the lack of opportunities, and she aspired to an international acting career. Bellucci appeared in the Emmy-winning biblical television miniseries &quot;Joseph&quot; (1995). In her view, the Italian film industry needed to invest more money to promote films internationally. Bellucci moved to France to improve her career prospects, and settled in Paris in 1995.

Bellucci&#x27;s portrayal of Lisa in &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1996), a &quot;moody&quot; French film noir, earned her a César Award nomination for Most Promising Actress. This launched her career in France and strengthened her position as an actress. It was her first French-language film. Gavanndra Hodge of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; stated that her &quot;break-out role&quot; was in the European arthouse film &quot;The Apartment&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s Almar Haflidason described the film as &quot;seductive&quot; and &quot;startling&quot;, giving it a rating of five stars. Bellucci&#x27;s second French film was Jan Kounen&#x27;s &quot;Dobermann&quot; (1997), in which she portrayed a mute Romani woman and had to learn sign language beforehand to embody her character. Recalling the filming process, she expressed an inclination for (stage settings) &quot;that pass more through bodies than through words&quot;. At this point in her career, Bellucci made a significant impact on European audiences. Pierce Brosnan performed a screen test with Bellucci for the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997) then requested she be given the role of Paris Carver but the studio stated only an American actress could be cast in the role. For her leading role as Giulia Giovannini in the Italian comedy-drama (1998), Bellucci received a Globo d&#x27;oro Award for Best Actress. &quot;The Apartment&quot; later won a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Best Film not in the English language, prompting film director Stephen Hopkins to take a close interest in Bellucci.

===2000–2003: American films, &quot;Malèna&quot;, and &quot;Irréversible&quot;===
In 2000, Monica Bellucci caught the attention of American audiences with her first English-language lead role in Hopkins&#x27; &quot;Under Suspicion&quot;, in which she starred opposite Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. Hopkins cast Bellucci after watching her performance in &quot;The Apartment&quot; and retained her ideas to create the character Chantal Hearst. Garth Pearce, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, noted her improved spoken English. &quot;Under Suspicion&quot; was selected as one of the 2000 Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s closing films, marking her red-carpet debut at the annual event. After the film&#x27;s release, Freeman said: &quot;It&#x27;s all there in her eyes. She has this quality that reminds me of Jeanne Moreau. There is a sense of having been there, that she&#x27;s had a life.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; listed Bellucci among &quot;the ten young actresses to keep an eye on&quot;.

Bellucci returned to Italian cinema, portraying Malèna Scordia, an enigmatic, envied and coveted World War II widow whose life unfolds before a 13-year-old boy in the Tornatore-directed film &quot;Malèna&quot; (2000), which is set in Sicily. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Kevin Thomas said the film emphasises the seductive appeal of the film&#x27;s protagonist Scordia, to whom Bellucci gave an &quot;heroic&quot; portrayal that was delivered with a few lines of dialogue. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Mark Salisbury considered Bellucci&#x27;s portrayal in the Oscar-nominated film her &quot;breakout performance&quot;. Malèna brought Bellucci worldwide attention; it was her first international success and caused her to be &quot;besieged by offers&quot; from Hollywood when Miramax secured the film for US distribution. For the US release, ten minutes of explicit, erotic scenes from the film were censored.

Bellucci starred with Samuel Le Bihan and Vincent Cassel in Christophe Gans&#x27; &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot;, a 2001 French period drama film that is based on historical events involving the beast of Gévaudan that decimated the population of in 18th-century France. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; film critic Stephen Hunter found the film&#x27;s stylistic approach too dense, obscuring Bellucci&#x27;s &quot;fabulous natural asset&quot;; she played an &quot;underused&quot; role as a courtesan–papist spy. The film received positive responses from other critics. &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; was a box-office success in France, where it attracted five million viewers and grossed  million worldwide, including $11 million in the US, against a budget of about  million. The film earned Bellucci a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 2002 Saturn Awards. The filming of &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot; (2002), in which Bellucci starred with Jamel Debbouze, which, with its light-hearted, comic atmosphere, was one of Bellucci&#x27;s favourite cinematographic experiences. She portrayed the &quot;prickly&quot; Cleopatra, the queen of Ancient Egypt, in the comedy film, which was directed by Alain Chabat. &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote Bellucci was &quot;certainly talented enough ... to merit getting the role of Cleopatra in some serious treatment&quot;, but before then, she had to perform in a &quot;funny mainstream commercial&quot; French production. The film was a success, selling 14 million tickets in France at the time of its release and grossing more than $128 million worldwide.

In 2002, Bellucci co-starred with Cassel in &#x27;s &quot;violent&quot; arthouse thriller . The revenge film, which was filmed on Super 16 film using hand-held cameras, depicts Bellucci playing Alex, who is graphically raped for nine uninterrupted minutes in an underpass, a scene Bellucci had to film four times. Bellucci&#x27;s &quot;indelible scene&quot; was filmed on the outskirts of Paris, in an area frequented by prostitutes. Bellucci and Cassel, who at the time were in a relationship, were some of &quot;the country&#x27;s biggest talents&quot;. Audiences at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival were outraged during the midnight premiere of &quot;Irréversible&quot;, with some calling it &quot;unsustainable&quot;. Lisa Nesselson of &quot;Variety&quot; said Bellucci showed &quot;responses to peril and joy [that are] particularly memorable&quot;. The film has been studied in film schools. Noé said he &quot;has never seen an actress so charismatic ... with that much guts ... her performance is incredibly audacious&quot;. K. Austin Collins of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Irréversible&quot; &quot;one of the most controversial movies ever&quot;.

In 2003, Bellucci played Alessia in the Italian film &quot;Remember Me, My Love&quot;, which was directed by Gabriele Muccino and earned Bellucci the Nastro d&#x27;Argento award for Best Supporting Actress. Bellucci co-starred with Bruce Willis in Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; (2003), an action-adventure film that is set during a civil war in Nigeria. Bellucci played Doctor Lena Kendricks, who is working for a humanitarian organisation in a village that is threatened by rebels. Film critic David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said some of Bellucci&#x27;s scenes were exaggeratedly stylised but praised the film&#x27;s visual prowess. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Kenneth Turan lauded Bellucci&#x27;s &quot;fierce&quot; portrayal of Kendricks, who also had a &quot;stereotypically fiery temperament&quot;. &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; garnered mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office disappointment.

Bellucci successively portrayed the character Persephone in the two 2003 science fiction films &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. She described her character as &quot;dangerous, sensual with some sense of humor&quot;, recalling fond memories with Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Keanu Reeves throughout the filming process in Australia. Film critic Andrew Sarris of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; gave &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; a positive review, grossing $742.1 million worldwide against a budget of $150 million. Alongside its release, Bellucci appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Spanish edition. The Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) again accompanied Bellucci as her screen husband in &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, which received mixed reviews from critics. It grossed $427 million against a production and marketing budget of $185 million.

===2004–2007: &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; and career progression===
In Rome, before filming &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot;, Bellucci was notified a Mel Gibson film about Jesus was in production and she asked to meet with him about the role of Mary Magdalene. Bellucci&#x27;s agent advised her against appearing in this film due to its potential failure because its distribution was undetermined at the time. Bellucci ignored her agent&#x27;s suggestion and rejected another film offer. Gibson chose Bellucci for the role because they &quot;liked each other&quot;. She wanted to portray the character as &quot;strong and deep&quot; but no-one believed the film would succeed. Eventually, Bellucci played an expressive Mary Magdalene in Gibson&#x27;s Christian drama &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), which depicts the final hours of the life of Jesus Christ. The film includes dialogue in Aramaic and Latin, languages Bellucci had to quickly learn. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic A. O. Scott said Bellucci was the only exception to the &quot;absence of identifiable movie stars&quot;. Expressing a similar opinion, &quot;Le Monde&quot; said in the film portraying afundamentalist view of the Gospel, Bellucci stands out from the cast list the most. According to film critic Paul Clinton, Bellucci &quot;is excellent as Mary Magdalene&quot;. Catholics objected to Bellucci playing Magdalene. Film critic Roger Ebert described &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; as &quot;the most violent film I have ever seen&quot;, adding he was &quot;moved by the depth of feeling, by the skill of the actors&quot; and gave a rating of four stars out of four. Overall, critics were divided in their responses to the film. &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was a major commercial success with a worldwide gross of over $611 million against a budget of $30 million.

On 2 July 2005, Bellucci was awarded the European Golden Globe for cinema at Rome&#x27;s 45th Globo d&#x27;oro ceremony. She said she appreciated acting in both American and European films. In Terry Gilliam&#x27;s fantasy adventure film &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot; (2005), Bellucci played the 500-year-old Mirror Queen, starring opposite Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. Gilliam later said: &quot;[i]mmediately she comes on-screen, it seems to me the whole film lifts up into another realm, a realm of sex and sensuality and danger&quot;. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; film critic Mick LaSalle said Bellucci convincingly portrayed her character, whose centuries-old age appeared to him to be discordant with her &quot;allure&quot;. She also voiced Cappy for the French version of the 2005 animated film &quot;Robots&quot;. Bellucci had a leading role in Bertrand Blier&#x27;s French romantic comedy &quot;How Much Do You Love Me?&quot;, which also starred . Bellucci portrayed Daniela, the most beautiful prostitute in Pigalle, Paris, whom a lottery-winning office worker offers to pay to live with him. A journalist at called the film &quot;a hymn to the beauty of Monica Bellucci&quot;, and said it is neither Blier&#x27;s best film nor his most failed. Nesselson commented Bellucci was optimally used in the film because she stimulates the viewer&#x27;s senses and intellect.

In 2006, Bellucci starred alongside Daniel Auteuil in &#x27;s period comedy-drama &quot;Napoleon and Me&quot; as baroness Emilia, who has a turbulent relationship Martino (Elio Germano). The film depicts Napoleon Bonaparte during his exile to Elba from 1814 to 1815. Author Mark Feeney said Bellucci does not take &quot;things too seriously&quot; in the film. Bellucci said she declined to play a role in the blockbuster &quot;300&quot; and instead appeared in the ( film) &quot;The Stone Council&quot;. Bellucci was cast after the initial announcement of Sophie Marceau for the lead role in the thriller. &quot;The Stone Council&quot; was adapted from the eponymous novel by Jean-Christophe Grangé. The film differs by character names; the book&#x27;s female hero is called Diane Thiberge whereas Bellucci starred as Laura Siprien, a tormented adoptive mother who is confronted by killers who want to steal her child. of wrote that she &quot;delivers one of her best performances on the big screen&quot; with a muted sex appeal. Bellucci&#x27;s hair was cut short for the film, a preferred style of French cinema hairstylist John Nollet, who also styled Bellucci on the sets of &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot;.

Bellucci starred opposite Paul Giamatti and Clive Owen in Michael Davis&#x27; action thriller &quot;Shoot &#x27;Em Up&quot;, which was released in the US in September 2007. Bellucci portrayed Donna Quintano, who teams up with Owen&#x27;s character Mr Smith to protect a baby during a bloody fight. Bellucci&#x27;s character is another prostitute with a different approach than that of her character in &quot;How Much Do You Love Me?&quot;; Bellucci said she felt empathy for female sex workers, who she believes retain &quot;faith in humanity&quot;. She was fond of this sort of paradox and tried to highlight this virtue in her portrayals of characters of all types but noted she could explore the opposite spectrum. Richard James Havis of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s the latest in a slew of extreme roles&quot;. Bellucci dubbed her own voice for the French and Italian releases of &quot;Shoot &#x27;Em Up&quot;, saying it was a frequent practice for her to accomplish each film three times.

Bellucci continued to work in French film productions and starred alongside Auteuil in Alain Corneau&#x27;s &quot;The Second Wind&quot;, a remake of the critically acclaimed Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s 1966 gangster film of the same title. Bellucci portrayed Manouche, a tenacious character who has affection for an escaped convicted gangster. Bellucci had the idea of dyeing her hair blonde to adhere to the style of female film noir characters of the 1950s and 1960s. , a critic for , wrote Bellucci was alone in a &quot;fatally virile&quot; context but she got through it &quot;to the point of becoming the spectator&#x27;s compass and the flesh of a film that sometimes lacks it&quot;. In November 2007, &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported on the commercial failures of &quot;The Second Wind&quot; and &quot;The Stone Council&quot;.

===2008–2017: Continued international work===
Bellucci felt a &quot;visceral&quot; need to regularly act in Italian films. In 2008, she co-starred in Marco Tullio Giordana&#x27;s &quot;Wild Blood&quot; with Luca Zingaretti. The historical panorama examines the fate of Luisa Ferida (Bellucci) and Osvaldo Valenti (Zingaretti), leading actors during the Italian fascism period. Author Barry Forshaw called Bellucci &quot;charismatic&quot; and author Gino Moliterno praised her performance as &quot;extremely powerful&quot;. Next, Bellucci played Alba in the Italian film &quot;The Man Who Loves&quot;, where she was enamoured with Pierfrancesco Favino&#x27;s character Roberto through a cinematic flashback.

On 5 March 2009, Bellucci received a World Actress Award at the Women&#x27;s World Award in Vienna. The same year, Bellucci co-starred with Marceau in the thriller &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, a sequel to &quot;In My Skin&quot;, both of which were directed by Marina de Van. The film depicts Marceau&#x27;s character seeing changes around her and noticing her body transform into Bellucci&#x27;s. J.B. Morain of &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; said Bellucci&#x27;s physical attitude and &quot;attention to others have never been so well filmed&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Derek Elley said Bellucci &quot;looks elegant and mystified&quot;, although both film critics noted the clumsily written dialogue. Bellucci reunited with Reeves in Rebecca Miller&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;The Private Lives of Pippa Lee&quot; (2009), which co-stars Winona Ryder and Robin Wright. Bellucci portrayed Gigi Lee, the former wife of a successful publisher Herb (Alan Arkin). She next appeared in a cameo role in Tornatore&#x27;s autobiographical film &quot;Baarìa&quot;, a family saga traversing several generations that was filmed in Bagheria, Sicily.

In 2010, Bellucci portrayed Laura Leviani in Larysa Kondracki&#x27;s biopic drama thriller &quot;The Whistleblower&quot;, which was primarily filmed in Romania and depicts a vast human trafficking network that was discovered in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1999. Hélène Delye of &quot;Le Monde&quot; described Bellucci&#x27;s character as a &quot;grizzled, stubborn, insensitive civil servant&quot;. &quot;The Whistleblower&quot; received a mixed critical reception. Bellucci made three films in seven months; these were Giovanni Veronesi&#x27;s &quot;The Ages of Love&quot;, Philippe Garrel&#x27;s &quot;A Burning Hot Summer&quot;, and Bahman Ghobadi&#x27;s &quot;Rhino Season&quot;. In the third segment of the comedy anthology film film &quot;The Ages of Love&quot; (2011), Bellucci starred opposite Robert De Niro, who played a divorced American art-history professor living in Rome who falls in love with Bellucci&#x27;s character Viola. De Niro was delighted to work with Bellucci, saying she had &quot;worked her magic&quot; on him and that he had accepted the role because he wanted to act alongside her. It was filmed two months after the birth of Bellucci&#x27;s second child. An improvised scene shows De Niro performing a striptease in front of Bellucci, which echoes in reverse a sequence in the 1963 film &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;, in which Sophia Loren stripteased for Marcello Mastroianni. For her role in &quot;Rhino Season&quot; (2012), Bellucci learnt to speak Farsi (Persian). Journalist Helen Barlow of SBS Australia said Bellucci &quot;brought her natural poise and grace&quot; to the character and &quot;surprises with a stoic minimalist performance&quot;.

In 2014, Bellucci appeared in Alice Rohrwacher&#x27;s &quot;The Wonders&quot; as Milly Catena, host of a televised contest. In the film, which combines autobiographical aspects with fiction, Bellucci&#x27;s character is depicted as a Pagan priestess wearing elaborate clothes and surrounded with ancient figures. &quot;The Wonders&quot; was critically acclaimed and won the Grand Prix Award at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, Bellucci starred as Sophie Bernard in the Canadian drama film &quot;Ville-Marie&quot;, which was directed by Guy Édoin. The film traces the journey of Bernard, a European actress visiting Montreal for a film shoot and trying to reconcile with her son. Bellucci stated Édoin had offered her &quot;one of the most beautiful roles&quot; of her career and described a stimulating fear of embodying Bernard&#x27;s character that emotionally affected her. The film garnered generally positive reviews and Bellucci&#x27;s performance was unanimously praised. For her portrayal of Bernard, Bellucci received the Best Actress Award from the Dublin Film Critics&#x27; Circle at Dublin International Film Festival.

At 50, Bellucci became the oldest Bond girl at that time in the James Bond film franchise, playing Lucia Sciarra in Sam Mendes&#x27; &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015). Bellucci was initially skeptical about Mendes&#x27; project but he argued casting a mature woman in a James Bond film would be innovative. Bellucci felt gratified to have been the first to portray a role she defined as a &quot;James Bond lady&quot;. &quot;Spectre&quot; was released to mixed reviews from critics though the British press responded more positively. The film grossed $880 million worldwide against a $250–300 million production budget. Guy Lodge of &quot;Variety&quot; called Bellucci &quot;[o]ne of the most restlessly globe-trotting stars in world cinema&quot; who does not want national borders or age brackets to dictate her filmography. In 2016, Bellucci had a guest role in the third season of the American comedy-drama streaming television series &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot;, an adaptation of Blair Tindall&#x27;s memoir &quot;Mozart in the Jungle: Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music&quot;, portraying Alessandra, an opera singer and latest collaborator of New York symphony orchestra conductor] Rodrigo (Gael García Bernal). &quot;Variety&quot;″s Nick Vivarelli called Bellucci the &quot;Italian actress with international star power&quot;.

Bellucci said: &quot;I decided to be an actress, not a politician, I recount political choices through my artistic choices.&quot; Kusturica asked Bellucci to learn her dialogue in the Serbian language. She had to adapt to challenging production conditions in a &quot;land of beauty and violence&quot;; Kusturica suffered &quot;great [mental] pain&quot; during filming, which spanned four summers. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Neil Young said the Golden Lion-nominated film&#x27;s approach lacks nuance while Bellucci performed &quot;admirably well&quot; and kept her &quot;dignity intact&quot; in a physically demanding role. Her performance in the film earned her the Nastro d&#x27;Argento europeo (European Silver Ribbon Award), which was held on 1 July 2017 at the ancient theatre of Taormina in Sicily.

In his appraisal of the film, Stephen Dalton of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said Bellucci portrayed her &quot;diva&quot; character through an &quot;operatic camp-vamp&quot; performance but that her acting style would be best suited to films by Tim Burton and Guillermo del Toro. Also in 2018, Bellucci appeared in the third season of the France 2 comedy television series (Ten Percent), playing herself with self-mockery. The well-received show was initially renamed &quot;Call My Agent!&quot; after its Netflix purchase.

According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Leah Greenblatt &quot;Memory&quot; is &quot;wrapped in leaden dialogue and B-movie cliché&quot; and Bellucci appears &quot;blasé&quot;.

In 2010, Rizzoli and published a book prefaced by Tornatore that described Bellucci&#x27;s modelling and acting careers through photographs taken by Peter Lindbergh and Helmut Newton. All proceeds from the book&#x27;s sales were donated to AGOP and Words of Women. She donated €10,000 to the City of Cannes to fund a solidarity campaign to support recovery efforts following the deadly floods of October 2015 in the Alpes-Maritimes region. Bellucci is also a patron of the association SOS Autism France.

===Foreign relations of Italy===
According to &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;″s Stefano Montefiori, Bellucci is regarded as a sort of ambassador of Italy to the French population. She has been involved in state dinners chaired by the President of France and organised as part of visits by foreign heads of state. On 21 November 2012, Bellucci attended a state dinner French President François Hollande hosted at the Elysée Palace in Paris during the visit of President of Italy Giorgio Napolitano and his ministers. On 5 July 2021, Bellucci was invited to a state dinner hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysée Palace in honour of Italian President Sergio Mattarella and his daughter Laura.

==Public image==
On 10 April 2016, the agency Karin Models, which represented Bellucci, opened an official Instagram account for her. Instagram censored a photograph Fred Meylan imaged in 2016 showing Bellucci swimming on her back in a pool, and body parts were hidden in yellow pixels. On 23 November 2004, Bellucci pressed the button triggering the Christmas illuminations on the Champs-Élysées avenue that consisted of of electric garlands descending from the Place de l&#x27;Étoile towards Place de la Concorde, in the presence of the First Deputy Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Bellucci was the first-ever foreign public figure invited by the City of Paris and the Committee to inaugurate this annual celebration. In April 2005, the Grévin Museum in Paris unveiled a wax statue of Bellucci. According to Blier, Bellucci is &quot;completely relaxed with her image and with her own sense of modesty as well&quot;; Blier compared her to Ava Gardner and &quot;the stars of yesteryear&quot;. On 9 May 2008, &quot;L&#x27;Obs&quot; reported on a survey of 1,003 people conducted by the Superior Audiovisual Council as part of Europe Day, where Bellucci was the second-most-popular European personality (excluding France) of the French.

Christophe Narbonne of &quot;Première magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;Behind the advertising muse, the image of the (re)incarnated Italian diva and the globalised sexual icon, we sometimes forget Monica Bellucci the out-of-norm actress, collector of a pile of international cult auteurs&quot;. De Morgen wrote: &quot;most roles fit Bellucci like a glove&quot;, while Christophe Carrière of L&#x27;Express said others of &quot;variable geometry&quot; compose her filmography. In 2018, Bellucci was included in &quot;Forbes Italy&quot;″s list of &quot;Successful women: the 100 winning Italian women&quot;. The press call Bellucci a style icon. Bellucci is associated with the wearing of high-value jewellery and an &quot;unwavering commitment&quot; to Cartier, Boucheron and Chopard; Naomi Pike of &quot;British Vogue&quot; referred to her as &quot;A Modern Day Liz Taylor&quot;, and said when dressed in diamonds, &quot;few contemporary Hollywood stars can rival Italian actor Monica Bellucci&quot;.

=== Appearance ===
Bellucci is widely regarded as &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world&quot; and has been cited as a sex symbol. In 2001, Bellucci was pictured nude with caviar on her breasts on the cover of &quot;Esquire&quot;″s &quot;Desire&quot; issue. In their reviews of Malèna (2000), Thomas wrote in &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Bellucci &quot;has the impact of the great Italian stars&quot;, and Paul Tatara of CNN International called her a &quot;world-class bombshell&quot;. In 2002, AskMen named her number one on the &quot;Top 99 Most Desirable Women&quot;. Bellucci was included in &quot;Empire&quot;″s list of &quot;Sexiest Women&quot;. In 2003, Chris Campion of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated: La Bellucci&#x27; is Italy&#x27;s national sweetheart and an icon of European cinema&quot;. Bellucci was named the &quot;Most Beautiful Woman in the World&quot; in 2004 and 2007 in an Ipsos survey of 1,002 people in France that was commissioned by TF1.

In 2011, Bellucci was ranked fourth in &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;″s list of the &quot;50 most beautiful women in film&quot;. She was voted number one on NRJ 12&#x27;s list of &quot;100 sexiest stars of 2011&quot;, which was based on a nationwide survey conducted in France that included American and French actresses, models, singers, female athletes and television presenters. In 2012, Bellucci said she had never undergone cosmetic procedures, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t like the idea of having my face retouched and, frankly, I think it&#x27;s quite dangerous for an actress. ... Compared to a plastic face, I prefer wrinkles.&quot;

In &quot;The Times&quot;, Pearce called Bellucci &quot;arguably the world&#x27;s most beautiful actress&quot;, saying she has the propensity to specialise in playing &quot;[u]gly scenes&quot;, which is exemplified by the rape scene in &quot;Irréversible&quot; (2002). In 2005, Salisbury wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; Bellucci represents an &quot;international object of desire&quot; and said: &quot;[i]n person, as on screen, Bellucci radiates a rare, otherworldly beauty&quot;. Based on Bellucci&#x27;s projected image and her work for Cartier, &quot;Kommersant&quot; described her as the &quot;type of diva whose fame depends little on her roles&quot;. Bellucci&#x27;s physical characteristics have led her inclusion in lists of all-time beauties and sex symbols compiled by magazines such as &quot;Esquire Japan&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; in the US and Australia.

Federico Roberto Antonelli, director of the Italian Cultural Institute in China, said: &quot;everyone dreams of &quot;Malèna&quot; Monica Bellucci&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Vogue France&quot; ranked Bellucci fourth in its list of the &quot;most beautiful Italian actresses of all time&quot;. Media consider Bellucci an Italian sex symbol. &quot;Rolling Stone Italy&quot; included Bellucci in its list of &quot;10 greatest sex symbols of the 1990s&quot;. She takes a &quot;peaceful&quot; attitude towards ageing and mainly believes in pasta, wine, and a little pilates for her &quot;beauty regime&quot;, and is not addicted to exercise and dieting. In 2023, Bellucci said having been &quot;objectified&quot; during her film career did not bother her and that she was aware she had made the most of her body for specific roles. Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2023 that Bellucci has achieved a &quot;reputation as a symbol of European glamour and sophistication&quot; that is &quot;firmly established&quot;.

==Personal life==
Monica Bellucci&#x27;s first marriage was with Italian photographer Claudio Carlos Basso. In a 2006 interview, Bellucci said she met Basso in 1987, when he recruited her for a photography session; she was 23 and he was five years older. Bellucci and Basso married in Monte-Carlo on 3 January 1990. They divorced a year later.

Bellucci was in a relationship with Italian actor for several years. Farron said they met in 1990 on the set of . Farron said he felt &quot;an overwhelming passion&quot; for Bellucci. Their relationship became unstable because other men increasingly lusted after Bellucci and the couple separated in 1995.

Bellucci and French actor Vincent Cassel met in 1995 on the set of their film &quot;The Apartment&quot;. They married in Monaco at the beginning of August 1999. Bellucci and Cassel have two daughters, Deva (born 12 September 2004) and Léonie (born 21 May 2010), both of whom were born in Rome. Film critic Jason Solomons wrote Bellucci and Cassel were &quot;the golden couple of European cinema&quot;. The couple acted together in nine films between 1996 and 2006. In March 2013, Bellucci reflected on the evolution of their marriage when she and Cassel often lived separately in Italy, France, Brazil and England. The couple&#x27;s separation by &quot;mutual agreement&quot; was announced on 26 August 2013 and they later divorced.

In October 2013, Bellucci said she had almost always been in a relationship since the one with her first boyfriend at the age of fourteen.

In 2019, Bellucci was in a relationship with the French sculptor and former model Nicolas Lefebvre. They had been dating since 2017. Lefebvre, who was then aged 36, and Bellucci made their relationship &quot;official&quot; in early March 2019 during a Chanel show at the Grand Palais in Paris. Bellucci told Italian magazine &quot;F&quot; about the end of their relationship, which was reported by other media in early July 2019.

In February 2023, &quot;Paris Match&quot; reported Bellucci and American filmmaker Tim Burton were in a relationship that began in October 2022. In June 2023, Bellucci confirmed she was in a relationship with Burton. They made their first public appearance at the Rome Film Festival in October 2023.

Besides her native Italian, Bellucci is fluent in French and English, and is proficient in Portuguese and Spanish. After her divorce from Cassel, Bellucci lived with her daughters in England, France, and Italy. By 2015, she had decided to live in France. Bellucci said: &quot;I am entirely Italian. Everything about me is Italian&quot;, and that &quot;Paris is part of my history&quot;. Bellucci said she votes in Italy, not in France, and she does not have French nationality. She owns houses in Rome and Lisbon, and in 2023, she purchased a villa on the Greek island of Paros.

According to Bellucci, she has moved away from her religious roots saying &quot;I come from a Catholic religion, but I&#x27;m not Catholic&quot;. She has called herself an agnostic.

In 2018, French tax authorities investigated Bellucci for non-declaration of a safe and bank accounts in Switzerland that were linked to an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). The French authorities tried to recover French taxes for the tax years 2011 to 2013 because they suspected tax evasion; Bellucci&#x27;s lawyer stated she lived in the UK and not Paris. In September 2021, Bellucci said being &quot;up to date with my tax obligations both in France and abroad&quot;. The results of the investigation into her Swiss bank accounts remain undisclosed. Following the investigation, Bellucci was named in the Pandora Papers, a massive data leak from offshore entities of high-profile figures, that was published in October 2021.

In 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; valued Bellucci&#x27;s wealth at $45 million, ranking her as the third-richest Italian actor.

<doc id="276353" wikidata="Q192171" url="?curid=276353" title="Linda Evangelista">
<text>Linda Evangelista ( ; born May 10, 1965) is a Canadian fashion model. She is regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential models of all time, and has been featured on over 700 magazine covers. Evangelista is primarily known for being the longtime muse of photographer Steven Meisel, as well as for the phrase: &quot;We don&#x27;t wake up for less than $10,000 a day.&quot;

Evangelista&#x27;s modelling career began in 1984 when she signed with Elite Model Management after having moved from her native Canada to New York City. Upon the suggestion of photographer Peter Lindbergh, Evangelista had her hair cut short in 1988.

Described as the &quot;chameleon&quot; of the fashion industry and as a key figure among the five supermodels (Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford), Evangelista was one of the most famous women in the world during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s.
Unlike her colleagues, Evangelista chose not to diversify into other ventures outside of modelling. She retired from her career in 1998 and made a comeback three years later, this time working only sporadically. Her achievements as a model led to her being voted as &quot;The Greatest Supermodel of All Time&quot; by the viewers of the television show &quot;Fashion File&quot; in 2008.

== Early life ==
Evangelista was born into a strict working-class Catholic family on May 10, 1965, in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. Her parents, Marisa and Tomaso &quot;Tom&quot; Evangelista (died 2014), had emigrated from the Italian town of Pignataro Interamna. Evangelista&#x27;s father worked for General Motors following his emigration in 1957, and her mother is a bookkeeper. Evangelista is the second of three children, with two brothers.

At the age of 12, Evangelista attended a self-improvement course in a modelling school, where she was taught things such as poise and etiquette and advised to attend a modelling course. Evangelista attended Denis Morris Catholic High School. She started modelling locally as a teenager. In 1981, Evangelista took part in the Miss Teen Niagara beauty pageant; while she did not win it, she caught the eye of a representative from Elite Model Management. At the age of 16, Evangelista flew to Japan to work as a model, but an unpleasant experience involving nudity during an assignment made her want to stop modelling altogether. She subsequently returned to Canada, and two years went by before she decided to try her hand at modelling again.

== Career ==

=== 1984–1987: Early career ===
Evangelista moved to New York City in 1984 upon signing with Elite, where she met the modelling agent John Casablancas, who compared her likeness to the model Joan Severance. Elite then moved Evangelista to Paris, where she launched her international high-fashion career at the age of 19. Her first major fashion magazine cover was for the November 1984 issue of &quot;L&#x27;Officiel&quot;. Subsequently, she appeared on the covers and in the pages of a variety of international publications, including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot;, and &quot;i-D&quot;. She appeared on a total of more than 700 covers worldwide.

In 1985, Evangelista began working with Karl Lagerfeld, the head designer of the fashion house Chanel, to whom she would become a muse. On the subject of Evangelista, Lagerfeld once uttered, &quot;There is not another model in the world as professional as she is.&quot; Evangelista became one of the first editorial models to successfully cross over into the realm of runway modelling, with her agent Piero Piazzi successfully booking her to walk for fashion designer Gianni Versace, for whom she became a muse. She first appeared in a Versace ad campaign in 1987. She also modelled for various other fashion brands such as Valentino, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gianfranco Ferré, Ralph Lauren, Yves Saint Laurent, Azzedine Alaïa, Oscar de la Renta, Giorgio Armani, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Donna Karan, Jil Sander, Jean Paul Gaultier, Alberta Ferretti, Isaac Mizrahi, Escada, Calvin Klein, Salvatore Ferragamo, Max Mara, Perry Ellis, Chloé, Comme des Garçons, Bill Blass, and Herve Leger. She has represented a diverse array of other companies and non-fashion brands like Visa, American Express, Pizza Hut, De Beers, and Elizabeth Arden.

In 1986, Evangelista met the photographer Steven Meisel, with whom she forged a friendship. From that point on, they began working together on many professional collaborations, and Evangelista became Meisel&#x27;s muse in the process. Starting in 1987, Evangelista began to appear in advertisements and commercials for Revlon&#x27;s &quot;The Most Unforgettable Women in the World&quot; campaign, which was photographed by Richard Avedon. She has also been photographed by Peter Lindbergh, Irving Penn, Francesco Scavullo, Herb Ritts, Bruce Weber, Gian Paolo Barbieri, Patrick Demarchelier, Paolo Roversi, Norman Parkinson, Arthur Elgort, Gilles Bensimon, Ellen von Unwerth, Sante D&#x27;Orazio, and Nick Knight among others.

=== 1988–1992: Supermodel career ===
It was Lindbergh who, in the autumn of 1988, suggested to Evangelista that she cut her hair short after seeing her try on a short wig for a photoshoot. Consequently, she got a short gamine haircut from the French hairstylist Julien d&#x27;Ys. The following day, she was photographed by Lindbergh, which resulted in a now-famous photograph known as &quot;the white shirt picture&quot;. Initially, the haircut was not well received by the fashion industry, and Evangelista was cancelled from 16 fashion shows. By the spring of 1989, her haircut was the look of the season. The haircut was referred to as &quot;The Linda&quot;, and it inspired the creation of a wig called &quot;The Evangelista&quot;.

Evangelista became known as one of the five supermodels, a group of star models who reached the pinnacle of success during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The supermodels were considered more famous than most actresses and singers of that time. In addition, Evangelista, along with Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell comprised a triumvirate that was dubbed &quot;The Trinity&quot;. They were joined by Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz for the cover of the January 1990 issue of &quot;British Vogue&quot;, which was photographed by Lindbergh. The cover itself was said to have &quot;defined the supermodel era&quot;. Upon seeing the cover, singer George Michael chose to cast them in the music video for his song &quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot;. In May of that year, Evangelista was chosen as one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot; by &quot;People&quot;. She also appeared on the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; where she served as a judge for an Elite model search competition, and chose Leslie Bibb as the winner, who later became an actress.

In an interview printed in the October 1990 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;, Evangelista said: &quot;We don&#x27;t wake up for less than $10,000 a day.&quot; () That statement is now thought of as the most famous quote in modelling history, and it has been described as &quot;the &#x27;Let them eat cake&#x27; of the 20th century&quot;. Also in October 1990, Evangelista stunned the fashion world by having the hairstylist Oribe dye her naturally brown hair platinum blonde. Months later, she had her hair dyed a shocking shade of red known as &quot;technicolor red&quot;. Throughout most of her modelling career, Evangelista was referred to as the fashion industry&#x27;s &quot;chameleon&quot; for the way that she constantly reinvented herself with various hairstyles and ever-changing hair colours that inspired hair trends. In terms of her looks, she was likened to Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, and Gina Lollobrigida.

In 1991, it was rumoured that the fashion house Lanvin paid Evangelista $20,000 to walk in their haute couture show for the spring/summer season, an amount that was considered excessive. Model Tyson Beckford recounted in an interview that Evangelista was instrumental in getting higher rates for models. That April, Evangelista waived her runway fee as an act of support for fashion designer Anna Sui&#x27;s debut collection, and instead accepted clothing as payment. Two months later, she attended Valentino&#x27;s 30th Anniversary Gala in Rome, Italy with Meisel. In September 1991, &quot;Time&quot; featured a cover story on the supermodels. The following month, in an article for &quot;Vogue&quot;, fashion journalist Suzy Menkes described Evangelista as &quot;the world&#x27;s star model&quot;. Evangelista then starred in the 1991 documentary &quot;Models: The Film&quot;, directed by Lindbergh. And, an episode of the MTV show &quot;House of Style&quot; devoted a segment to Evangelista, which was filmed in Paris.

During the latter part of 1991 and throughout 1992, Evangelista was seen on several different billboards for the fashion brand Kenar, in the center of Times Square. The billboards were done in conjunction with Ads Against AIDS, which was a campaign created by the advertising industry to raise awareness about tackling the disease. The most talked about and most controversial of those billboards was one that showed Evangelista seated among seven older Sicilian women. It was said that the image, which got dubbed &quot;Beauty and the Seven Beasts&quot; by Richard Johnson in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, promoted a negative depiction of Italian women. Nonetheless, limited edition prints of the image were sold for $1,000 a piece, to benefit Ads Against AIDS. Also, the image was chosen as one of the &quot;20 most important fashion photographs ever&quot; by the International Center of Photography. Kenneth Zimmerman, president of Kenar, said of Evangelista, &quot;She has increased our sales dramatically.&quot; He further added, &quot;Linda was our Michael Jordan. We chose her because we wanted a star, and of the four or five star models, she is number one.&quot;

In April 1992, Evangelista and several other supermodels appeared on the cover of the 100th anniversary issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;, which remains to this day as the magazine&#x27;s highest-selling issue. She then appeared in the music video for George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Too Funky&quot; song, in which she parodied her modelling persona. In July 1992, she was on the cover of Canadian fashion magazine &quot;Flare&quot;, which was an issue honouring Canada&#x27;s 125 years as a nation. She was also said to have started the trend for thin eyebrows, which later coincided with the arrival of the Neo-Hippie fashion trend in the fall of 1992. Her cover for the September 1992 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; is now seen as &quot;iconic&quot;, and it was ranked #9 on the American Society of Magazine Editors&#x27; list of the &quot;Top 40 Magazine Covers of the Last 40 Years&quot; in 2005. Toward the end of 1992, her name was immortalized in RuPaul&#x27;s song, &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;.

=== 1993–1998: Later career and retirement ===
Evangelista made headlines in 1993 when she travelled to Australia with Claudia Schiffer for a 5-day tour, which included a news conference and a televised fashion show, as part of the grand opening of a department store.
In October 1994, Evangelista was one of several models on the cover of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;′s 30th anniversary issue. She then appeared in the feature film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot;. In 1995, the hairstylist Garren of New York changed Evangelista&#x27;s look by giving her an asymmetrical bob similar to mod hairstyles of the 1960s. That same year, she took part in Thierry Mugler&#x27;s 20th anniversary fashion show. Evangelista later landed an endorsement deal with Clairol worth over $5 million. She also starred in the fashion documentary &quot;Unzipped&quot;. Additionally, she was a presenter at the Miss World 1995 competition.

In 1996, Evangelista was one of the ten subjects of Lindbergh&#x27;s book &quot;10 Women&quot;, on whose cover she appeared. She was also seen in the fashion documentary &quot;Catwalk&quot;. She was also the cover model for the inaugural issues of &quot;Vogue Taiwan&quot; and &quot;Vogue Korea&quot;. And, she landed a $7.75 million contract with Yardley of London. Eventually, she made the choice to retire from modelling in 1998, and settled on the French Riviera, where she spent the next two years.

=== 2001–Present: Return to modelling ===
In 2001, Evangelista made a noteworthy return to the modelling world, and appeared on the cover of the September issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;. Also in 2001, she helped to revive the &quot;What Becomes a Legend Most?&quot; ad campaign for Blackglama furs, which hadn&#x27;t been seen in six years. Rocco Laspata, the photographer of the campaign, described Evangelista as &quot;the Maria Callas of modeling&quot;. Then, in 2002, she was in the ad campaign for Versace&#x27;s fall/winter collection. The next year, she was back on the high-fashion runways, walking for Versace and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Furthermore, she closed Chanel&#x27;s fall/winter 2003 haute couture show wearing a white wedding gown. In 2004, she appeared in the spring/summer ad campaigns for both NARS Cosmetics and Fendi. She also walked the runway for Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s debut collection at Hermès. That summer, she was featured in Ann Taylor&#x27;s 50th anniversary ad campaign, photographed by Annie Leibovitz.

In 2006, Evangelista appeared on the cover of the book &quot;In Vogue: The Illustrated History of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Fashion Magazine&quot; along with model Kristen McMenamy, photographed by Meisel. In August of that year, Evangelista made the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;, becoming the first model to appear on that magazine&#x27;s cover in more than a year. Her final runway appearance was in 2007, when she participated in the 60th anniversary fashion show for the Christian Dior brand. That year, she signed a multiple-year exclusive contract as the brand ambassador for the cosmetics giant L&#x27;Oreal Paris.

In May 2008, she made an appearance at the Cannes film festival where she posed for photographers on the red carpet along with fellow beauty Aishwarya Rai. Evangelista was then photographed by Meisel for the Prada fall/winter 2008 campaign. She also appeared in the September 2008 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; for a feature story on the supermodels titled &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. In 2009, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held an exhibition called &quot;The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion&quot; which paid tribute to several fashion models including Evangelista, and she was on the cover of the exhibition&#x27;s accompanying book. In 2010, she was chosen to star in the ad campaign for the revamped Talbots brand.

Evangelista was photographed by Lagerfeld for Chanel&#x27;s spring 2012 eyewear ad campaign.
In May 2012, Evangelista was on the cover of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; after a three-year hiatus from the magazine. She was then featured in the book &quot;Vogue: The Editor&#x27;s Eye&quot; as one fashion&#x27;s model-muses. That November, she was on the cover of the 35th anniversary issue of &quot;Fashion&quot; magazine. A few months later, the Spanish fashion brand Loewe chose her to represent its newest fragrance Aura.

In June 2013, she attended the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards show, where she presented fashion journalist Tim Blanks with the Media Award. She was photographed by Lagerfeld for the July 2013 cover of &quot;Vogue Germany&quot;, where she was styled to look like vintage actress Anna Magnani, and posed with Lagerfeld&#x27;s pet cat Choupette. Also that month, she was on the cover of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; for an issue that celebrated the 25th anniversary of Franca Sozzani&#x27;s tenure as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief.

In 2014, Evangelista was present at the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner. She appeared in the fall/winter 2014 ad campaign for the fashion brand Moschino, photographed by Meisel. She was also one of several models on the cover of &quot;Vogue Japan&quot;&#x27;s September 2014 issue, which marked the magazine&#x27;s 15th anniversary. And, she was on the cover of the September 2014 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, which has been described as &quot;Harper&#x27;s biggest ever&quot;. Moreover, she was one of 50 models on the September 2014 cover of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s 50th anniversary issue. Evangelista has remained the recordholder for the most &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; covers. She was also chosen to represent Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s new line of makeup. In October 2014, it was announced that Evangelista had signed on to be a guest judge on the ninth season of the reality television series &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

Evangelista was chosen by Canadian department store Hudson&#x27;s Bay as the face of the spring 2015 campaign for its luxury clothing section called The Room. The campaign was photographed by Pamela Hanson. In June 2015, Evangelista was a chairwoman for the FiFi Awards, where she presented the awards for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s prestige fragrance of the year. In October 2015, Evangelista appeared on the cover of a book showcasing the work of hat designer Philip Treacy titled &quot;Philip Treacy: Hat Designer&quot;. The cover photograph of Evangelista was mentioned by Treacy as being &quot;the most precious thing I own&quot;. Also in October, Evangelista starred in the campaign for Moschino&#x27;s newest fragrance Fresh, photographed by Meisel.

In celebration of the 100th anniversary of &quot;British Vogue&quot;, a photograph of Evangelista originally taken in 1991 was chosen as the cover image for the book &quot;Vogue 100: A Century of Style&quot;, released in February 2016. In April 2016, Evangelista appeared on the cover of &quot;Zoo Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 50th issue, photographed by singer and friend Bryan Adams. Also that month, Evangelista appeared on the cover of the book &quot;Age of the Supermodel&quot;, which features photographs taken by photographer Donna DeMari during the haute couture collections in Paris in 1991. Evangelista worked as fashion stylist for a photo spread titled &quot;A Model Journey&quot; in the September 2016 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, which was based on her early years as a model. In September 2016, Evangelista reunited with Turlington and Campbell to appear in a campaign for the Elephant Crisis Fund. In November 2016, Evangelista was named Creative Director and Vice President of the Erasa Skin Care brand.

Evangelista is featured in the four-part Apple TV+ docuseries &quot;The Super Models.&quot; Premiered on September 20, 2023, the series also features Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, and Christy Turlington and is directed by Roger Ross Williams and Larissa Bills.

== Cultural impact ==
Decades after uttering the comment about working for no less than $10,000 a day, the quote continued to be referenced in the media, being mentioned as late as July 2017. Evangelista herself has said, &quot;I saw a movie, &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;, and there&#x27;s a line in it where Brad Pitt says he won&#x27;t get out of bed for less than half a million dollars. That&#x27;s my line! Only now it&#x27;s a half million and it&#x27;s a man saying it.&quot; Over the years, various different T-shirts emblazoned with the $10,000 a day quote have been sold, and there is even an embroidered pillow containing the quote. The G Hotel in Galway, Ireland, includes a presidential suite that was named in honour of Evangelista, with its interiors designed by Treacy. The September 1991 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot; had a photo spread titled &quot;Wild At Heart&quot; that featured Evangelista, photographed by Lindbergh. One of the images from that spread is known as &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;, and a platinum-palladium print of the image was sold at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for over $30,000. In October 2012, a picture of Evangelista and McMenamy that was photographed by Meisel for &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s October 1992 issue was sold at a Phillips auction for $86,500. In May 2016, a 1988 picture of Evangelista and five other models that was photographed by Lindbergh sold at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for $118,462. A 1996 photograph of Evangelista, titled &quot;Linda Kissing Linda&quot;, which was originally featured in a Kenar advertisement, was selected by the Guggenheim Museum as &quot;an example of the epitome of androgyny&quot;.

Evangelista influenced a number of female celebrities as either an inspiration or as a beauty icon. Among them are Victoria Beckham, Martha Stewart, models Candice Swanepoel, Kylie Bax, Kendall Jenner and Elsa Benítez, model-turned-actress Angie Harmon, and singer Rihanna.

Evangelista has drawn praise and accolades from many of the fashion industry&#x27;s elite. Philip Treacy said, &quot;Linda is the ultimate model of the past 50 years&quot;. Karl Lagerfeld once described Evangelista as &quot;the most famous of all&quot;, and &quot;the best model in the world&quot;, explaining, &quot;Because she&#x27;s a true model, pure and simple. She doesn&#x27;t pretend or aspire to do anything else. She&#x27;s just brilliant at what she does.&quot; Designer Stefano Gabbana said of Evangelista, &quot;Linda is &quot;the&quot; model. If you talk about models of the sixties and seventies, the first name is Veruschka. In the eighties and nineties, it&#x27;s Linda.&quot; David Bonnouvrier, one of the founders of DNA Model Management said, &quot;Linda is the model of all time, to its strictest definition. She could be out of a Cecil Beaton picture, she could be out of a Guy Bourdin picture.&quot; Sozzani, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;, recounted that she would receive letters from readers concerned about &quot;what would happen to the magazine if Linda got sick. Because it was all about Linda Evangelista. Her face had the most possibilities.&quot; Sozzani additionally stated, &quot;For me, she is the model, not only for her beauty, but her attitude, her intelligence.&quot;

Meisel, to whom Evangelista is his &quot;muse&quot;, considers her &quot;extraordinarily photogenic&quot;. Fashion designer John Galliano has said that &quot;inspiration hasn&#x27;t been the same without her. She is an enormous influence on all the photographers and stylists.&quot; In his book &quot;Face Forward&quot;, the late makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin said of Evangelista, &quot;I first worked with Linda in the early eighties and have yet to meet another model who was more involved in every aspect of her work. Her specialties were knowing what was best for her hair, makeup, styling, and lighting -- and Linda was always right. It was mind-boggling. Many of the unforgettable images of this haunting beauty were, in great degree, due to her involvement.&quot; This sentiment was echoed by fashion stylist Paul Cavaco, who described Evangelista as &quot;the greatest collaborator of all time.&quot;

Evangelista was referred to as &quot;the supermodel’s supermodel&quot; by Marcus Chang of &quot;&quot;. According to Shane Watson of &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;Of all the supermodels, Linda was most responsible for elevating the job into an art form, pushing up the fees, piling on the expectations and generally ensuring that by the end of the Eighties the world of the top model had become as lucrative, glamorous and shrouded in enigma as that of the Hollywood star&quot;.

== Activism and awards ==

Evangelista is an activist for HIV/AIDS research and awareness, as well as for breast cancer research and awareness. She was one of the icons in the Viva Glam campaign for the Mac AIDS Fund. In October 2013, she was the host of amfAR&#x27;s Inaugural Inspiration Gala in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Evangelista also supports the Elton John AIDS Foundation and is an advocate for LGBT concerns.

In 1996, she was the recipient of VH1&#x27;s Fashion Awards Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented to her by Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of &quot;Vogue&quot;. In June 2003, she received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. In 2005, she was named as a World Fashion Icon by the Women&#x27;s World Awards in Leipzig, Germany. In March 2008, she was chosen as &quot;The Greatest Supermodel of All Time&quot; by a viewer poll for the CBC Television show &quot;Fashion File&quot;.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships ===
In 1987, Evangelista married Gérald Marie, who was the head of Elite Model Management&#x27;s Paris office. They were divorced in 1993. She also dated actor Kyle MacLachlan, whom she first met on a photoshoot for Barneys New York in 1992. The couple became engaged in 1995 but broke up in 1998. Afterward, she dated French football player Fabien Barthez. She became pregnant but miscarried, six months into the pregnancy. The couple broke up in 2000, reunited in 2001, and then officially ended their relationship in 2002.

=== Child support case ===
In October 2006, Evangelista gave birth to a son but refused to name his father, sparking rumours. While pregnant, she appeared on the August 2006 cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;. In late June 2011, Evangelista filed court papers that revealed her son was fathered by billionaire Frenchman François-Henri Pinault, whom Evangelista had dated for four months in late 2005 and early 2006. Pinault later married actress Salma Hayek. After several court appearances aimed at establishing a child-support agreement, on August 1, 2011, Evangelista formally filed for a child support order in Manhattan Family Court, seeking $46,000 in monthly child support from Pinault. It was reported that if granted, this amount &quot;would probably be the largest support order in the history of the family court&quot;. A heavily publicized child support trial began on May 3, 2012, and included testimony from both Pinault and Evangelista, with Evangelista&#x27;s attorney claiming that Pinault had never supported the child. Several days into the trial, on May 7, 2012, Evangelista and Pinault reached an out-of-court settlement.

===Religion===
In a 1997 interview, Evangelista said that she was a practicing Roman Catholic and that her favourite book was the Bible.

===Failed cosmetic procedure and lawsuit===
In September 2021 Evangelista explained why she had withdrawn from public life and not been working. Five years previously she had undergone the cosmetic fat removal procedure cryolipolysis, under the brand name CoolSculpting, but that this had done the opposite with the complication paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH). Evangelista initiated legal action against CoolSculpting&#x27;s owner Zeltiq Aesthetics, a subsidiary of Allergan, seeking $50million in damages for emotional distress and lost income. Evangelista settled the case in July 2022.

===Health issues===
In 2023, Evangelista revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2018. She received chemotherapy and underwent a bilateral mastectomy; the cancer returned in 2022 in her pectoral muscle for which she also received chemotherapy.

<text>Mr. Olympiais the title awarded to the winner of the professional men&#x27;s bodybuilding contest in the open division at Joe Weider&#x27;s Olympia Fitness &amp; Performance Weekend—an international bodybuilding competition that is held annually and is sanctioned by the IFBB Professional League. Joe Weider created the contest to enable the amateur Mr. Universe winners to continue competing and to earn money. The first Mr. Olympia was held on September 18, 1965, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York City, with Larry Scott winning his first of two straight titles. The equivalent female title is Ms. Olympia.

The record number of wins is eight each by Lee Haney (1984–1991) and Ronnie Coleman (1998–2005). Samson Dauda currently holds the title.

In addition to the Mr. Olympia title in the Open division, other male divisions include the 212 division since 2012, the Men&#x27;s Physique division since 2013, and the Classic Physique division since 2016.

The film &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; (1977) featured the buildup to the 1975 Mr. Olympia in Pretoria, South Africa, and helped launch the acting careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, and Franco Columbu.

As well as the Ms. Olympia title, female titles include Fitness Olympia and Figure Olympia for fitness and figure competitors. All four contests occur during the same weekend. From 1994 to 2003, and again in 2012, a Masters Olympia was also crowned. Globally, a version with amateur competitors is also presented, the Mr. Olympia Amateur.

== History ==
=== 1960s ===

The 1965 and 1966 Mr. Olympia were won by Larry Scott, a famous bodybuilder of the time. Scott retired after his 1966 victory, and attempted to make a comeback in 1979, he showed a la physique that wasn’t at his peak and he decided to retire from competitive bodybuilding in 1980. 

Harold Poole holds two Mr. Olympia distinctions : one is that he is the youngest ever competitor to have participated in the Olympia—in 1965 he competed in the first Mr. Olympia at the age of 21; the other is that he was the only man to compete in all three of the initial Mr. Olympia contests.

The 1967 Mr. Olympia, won by Sergio Oliva, heralded a new era in bodybuilding competition. At 5 ft 10 ins and 240 lbs Oliva, nicknamed &quot;The Myth&quot;, displayed an unforeseen level of muscle mass and definition, including a &quot;V&quot; shape of a large and a well-formed upper-body that tapered down to a narrow waist.

Oliva would go on to win the Mr. Olympia competition in 1967, 1968 (uncontested), and 1969—where he would defeat Arnold Schwarzenegger four to three, marking Schwarzenegger&#x27;s only loss in a Mr. Olympia competition.

With the emergence of a performance enhancing drug called Dianabol in 1958, bodybuilders began experimenting more with the idea of unnatural ways to improve their physiques as well as intensify their training regimens. Dianabol was affordable, and the 1960&#x27;s became a free-for all in terms of experimentation with many kinds of performance enhancing drugs. These anabolic steroids were not only used by bodybuilders, but also by Olympic athletes and NFL players. For example, Schwarzenegger and players on the Pittsburgh Steelers used performance enhancing drugs in the 1960&#x27;s to 70&#x27;s to improve both their physiques and performances.

=== 1970s ===
Schwarzenegger defeated Oliva at the 1970 Mr. Olympia after finishing second the year before, and also won in 1971 (being the only competitor). He defeated Oliva again in 1972, and went on to win the next three Mr. Olympia competitions, including the 1975 edition, which was highlighted in the 1977 docudrama &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; and featured other notable bodybuilders such as Lou Ferrigno, Serge Nubret, and Franco Columbu, who would go on to win the 1976 and 1981 competitions.

From 1974 until 1979, a dual weight division system was used, splitting competitors into two categories: &quot;Heavyweights&quot; (over 200lbs) and &quot;Lightweights&quot; (under 200lbs). The winners of each division would then compete against each other to decide an overall champion.

After winning the 1975 competition, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from competitive bodybuilding; this was also depicted in &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;.

Frank Zane won the 1977, 1978, and 1979 competitions.

The Sandow Trophy was awarded for the first time in 1976, a homage to the widely-recognized &quot;father of modern bodybuilding&quot;, Eugen Sandow.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Schwarzenegger came out of retirement to win the Olympia yet again, after a five-year hiatus. Schwarzenegger (who was supposedly training for the film Conan the Barbarian) had been a late entry into the competition, and his competitors did not know of his intentions to compete. This seventh victory was especially controversial, as most fellow competitors and observers felt that he lacked both muscle mass and conditioning, and shouldn&#x27;t have won over Chris Dickerson or Mike Mentzer. Several athletes vowed to boycott the contest the following year, and Mentzer retired for good.

The following year, Franco Columbu was victorious for the second time. Chris Dickerson won his only title in 1982, making him the first openly gay Mr. Olympia. Samir Bannout won his only title in 1983, making the first Lebanese Mr. Olympia.

From 1984 to 1991, Lee Haney won eight consecutive Mr. Olympia titles, setting a record that was later tied by Ronnie Coleman.

=== 1990s ===
Haney retired from competitive bodybuilding after his last Mr. Olympia victory in 1991. Having placed second to Haney the previous year, Dorian Yates won the competition six straight times from 1992 until 1997. Dorian is given credit for revolutionizing the sport during his reign as Mr. Olympia by combining larger mass than seen before with what was dubbed &quot;granite hardness&quot;.

In the 1990s, the use of growth hormones by bodybuilders was reported, and they started to appear in competitions with an increasing physical size.

Yates retired from competitive bodybuilding after his 1997 victory, having accumulated several injuries. Ronnie Coleman, who placed 9th in 1997, surprised everyone with a much improved physique in 1998, winning the first of 8 consecutive titles.

In 1994, a separate Masters Olympia competition for professional bodybuilders was created, to compete at the highest levels in their later years.

=== 2000s ===

Ronnie Coleman won the Mr. Olympia competition eight consecutive times from 1998 to 2005, tying the record set by Lee Haney. Coleman, nicknamed &quot;The King&quot;, is widely regarded as the greatest bodybuilder in Olympia history and began the mass monster era.

Coleman returned in 2006 to try to beat the record for Olympia wins but was unable even to defend his title, instead placed second to Jay Cutler, who won his first title after four consecutive years of finishing second to Coleman. Cutler successfully defended his title in 2007. Coleman came in fourth place and announced his retirement from competition, ending one of the biggest rivalries in the competition&#x27;s history.

In 2008, Dexter Jackson defeated Jay Cutler and became Mr. Olympia. In 2009, Jay Cutler returned and regained the title.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Cutler returned to claim his fourth Mr. Olympia title, becoming the fifth competitor in Olympia history to win the title more than three times.

In 2011, Phil Heath defeated Cutler for the title, beginning a winning streak that lasted until 2018. From 2012 to 2014, the Olympia was dominated by the rivalry between Kai Greene and Heath, with Heath winning all three and Greene placing second.

Starting in 2016, a new division called Classic Physique was introduced, a division that emphasizes symmetry, proportion, pleasing lines, and a small waist, over size and mass. Danny Hester was the inaugural champion in Classic Physique division.

Heath won his seventh-consecutive Mr. Olympia in 2017, with Mamdouh Elssbiay taking second. With his 2017 win, Heath tied Arnold Schwarzenegger for second most Olympia victories, behind Lee Haney and Ronnie Coleman who won eight.

Shawn Rhoden defeated Phil Heath in 2018, snapping Heath&#x27;s streak of seven victories. The 2019 Mr. Olympia was won by Brandon Curry.

In the 212 Division, James &quot;Flex&quot; Lewis won a record 7 consecutive victories from 2012 to 2018.

Starting in 2018, a new division called Wheelchair Olympia was added.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020 Phil Heath returned for an attempted record-tying eighth title, but Mamdouh Elssbiay won the Olympia for his first title. Elssbiay won for the second time in 2021. Hadi Choopan won in 2022, Derek Lunsford won in 2023 and Samson Dauda won in 2024.

In the Classic Physique division, Chris Bumstead won a record six consecutive titles from 2019 to 2024, eventually retiring after his sixth win in 2024.

== Qualifying ==
The IFBB selects Olympia contestants from among the highest-placed competitors at various qualifying competitions, collectively referred to as the Olympia Qualifying Season. The qualifying season for each Olympia runs for a year, and ends a few months before the competition. Under updated qualifying rules announced by the IFBB in 2019, to qualify for most divisions at the Olympia an IFBB athlete must meet one of the following criteria:

* Place in the top three in their division at the previous Olympia
* Win any of the IFBB qualifying contests
* Rank among the top three in total points awarded for second through fifth place at qualifying competitions

For certain divisions with more than 25 qualifying competitions, slightly different rules are used: The previous Olympia winner is automatically qualified, plus the winner of each qualifying competition and the top five in total points.

The IFBB Professional League also has the discretion to extend special invitations to other competitors.

<text>Heidi Klum (; born 1 June 1973) is a German and American model, television personality, producer, and businesswoman. She appeared on the cover of the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; in 1998 and was the first German model to become a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel.

Following a successful modeling career, Klum became the host and a judge of &quot;Germany&#x27;s Next Topmodel&quot; and the reality show &quot;Project Runway&quot;, which earned her an Emmy nomination in 2008 and a win in 2013 for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program (shared with co-host Tim Gunn). Klum has been nominated for six Emmy Awards. She has worked as a spokesmodel for Dannon and H&amp;M and has appeared in numerous commercials for McDonald&#x27;s, Volkswagen, and others. In 2009, Klum became Barbie&#x27;s official ambassador on Barbie&#x27;s 50th anniversary. As an occasional actress, she had supporting roles in movies including &quot;Blow Dry&quot; (2001) and &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; (2004), and made cameo appearances in &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006), &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot; (2007) and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; (2018). She has also made guest appearances on TV shows including &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation.&quot; From 2013 to 2019, and again from 2020 to 2024, Klum was featured as a judge on the NBC reality show &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

In May 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated Klum&#x27;s total earnings for that year as US$20 million. She was ranked second on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of the &quot;World&#x27;s Top-Earning Models&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; noted that since ending her 13-year run as a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a businesswoman than a model. In 2008, she became an American citizen while maintaining her native German citizenship.
==Early life and discovery==
Klum was born and raised in Bergisch Gladbach, a city near Cologne, West Germany. She is the daughter of Erna Klum (née Berger), a hairdresser, and Günther Klum, a cosmetics company executive. A friend convinced her to enroll in a national modeling contest called &quot;Model 92&quot;. Out of 25,000 contestants, Klum was voted the winner on 29 April 1992, and she was offered a modeling contract worth by Thomas Zeumer, CEO of Metropolitan Models New York. After winning, she appeared on the &quot;Gottschalk Late Night Show&quot;, a German television show with host Thomas Gottschalk. She accepted the contract a few months later, after graduating from school, and decided not to try for an apprentice position at a fashion design school.

==Career==

International tech, food and internet brands up to the automotive industry asked for Klum as their celebrity spokesperson and produced ad campaigns and TV commercials for Braun epilizer, McDonald&#x27;s salad, Dannon, Carl&#x27;s Jr./Hardee&#x27;s (Jim Beam Bourbon Burger), the Wix website building program and, together with then-husband Seal for the &quot;Volkswagen&quot; SUV &quot;Tiguan&quot;. In addition to modeling, she has appeared in several TV shows, including &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Yes, Dear&quot;, and &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. She had a role as an ill-tempered hair model in the movie &quot;Blow Dry&quot;, played a giantess in the movie &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; and was cast as Ursula Andress in &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;. She had cameo appearances in the films &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; and &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot;.

Her other projects include dance and video games. She is featured in the 2003 video game &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;, where she plays the villain Dr. Katya Nadanova. She has appeared in several music videos, including Jamiroquai&#x27;s video &quot;Love Foolosophy&quot; from their album &quot;A Funk Odyssey&quot;, Kelis&#x27;s &quot;Young, Fresh n&#x27; New&quot;, off her second 2001 album &quot;Wanderland&quot; and, most recently, the second video for her then husband Seal&#x27;s song &quot;Secret&quot; off his 2010 album &quot;Seal 6: Commitment&quot;. The latter video depicts the married couple sharing intimate moments while naked in bed; the concept was Klum&#x27;s idea.
In July 2007, having earned in the previous 16 months, Klum was named by &quot;Forbes&quot; as third on the list of the World&#x27;s 15 Top-Earning Supermodels.

In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated her income at , putting Klum in first place. For 2007, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated her income at . Klum is signed to IMG Models in New York City. In 2008, Klum was a featured guest on an American Volkswagen commercial, where she was interviewed by a black Beetle. When she commented that German engineering is so sexy, she caused the Beetle to blush and turn red. She has been a part of several commercials for Volkswagen and McDonald&#x27;s on German television. In November 2008, Klum appeared in two versions of a &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot; commercial, wherein she did a take on Tom Cruise&#x27;s iconic underwear dancing scene in &quot;Risky Business&quot;. In both versions, she lip-synced to Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; while dancing around the living room with the wireless guitar controller.

In October 2009, Klum was the often-nude one-woman subject of &quot;Heidilicious&quot;, a photo book by photographer Rankin. Klum ventured into web-based videos, starring in &quot;SPIKED HEEL: Supermodels Battle the Forces of Evil&quot;. The web-series starred model Coco Rocha and was directed by fashion documentarian Doug Keeve. In the story, Klum aka &#x27;The Kluminator,&#x27; and her stylish sidekick Coco &quot;The Sassy Superhero&quot; Rocha battle the evil Dr. Faux Pas who is plotting to destroy Fashion Week. The heroines employ everything from blow-dryer guns to fist fights, to thwart Dr. Faux Pas&#x27; dastardly plans. The Kluminator and Girl Wonder avoid a chain of fashion disasters to neutralize a death ray that threatens to vaporize the community of fashionistas gathered in Bryant Park. In 2010, Klum became the new face and creative advisor for European cosmetics brand Astor, for which she sets artistic direction and designs new products and fashion forward color collections. In October 2010, Klum parted ways with Victoria&#x27;s Secret after 13 years of working with the brand. She provided a simple explanation in her official statement, stating: &quot;All good things have to come to an end. I will always love Victoria and never tell her secret. It&#x27;s been an absolute amazing time!&quot;

It was reported in May 2011 that Klum ranked second with estimated earnings of on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of the &quot;World&#x27;s Top-Earning Models&quot; (2010–2011). &quot;Forbes&quot; noted that since ending her 13-year run as a Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a businesswoman than a model. She partnered with New Balance and Amazon.com to launch a clothing line and signed a 20-episode deal to host a new show on Lifetime, called &quot;Seriously Funny Kids&quot;.

Some noted fashion designers have long commented on Klum&#x27;s limited role as a fashion model. Karl Lagerfeld, for example, in 2009 agreed with German designer Wolfgang Joop, who said after Klum had posed naked on the cover of the German edition of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, that she was &quot;no runway model. She is simply too heavy and has too big a bust&quot;. Lagerfeld observed that neither he nor Claudia Schiffer knew Klum, as she has never worked in Paris and was insignificant in the world of fashion, being &quot;more bling bling and glamorous than current fashion.&quot;

===Producing===
In December 2004, Klum became the host, judge and executive producer of the reality show &quot;Project Runway&quot; on the U.S. cable television channel Bravo (airing on Lifetime television beginning in 2009), in which fashion designers compete for the opportunity to show their line at New York Fashion Week and receive money to launch their own fashion line.

Klum has been the host, judge and co-producer of &quot;Germany&#x27;s Next Topmodel&quot;, the German version of the internationally successful reality television show, since 2006. All twelve seasons aired on the German TV station ProSieben. In 2013, Klum, along with her co-host Tim Gunn won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program.

Klum became Barbie&#x27;s official ambassador for the doll&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2009, even having made a Barbie doll out of herself. On 1 April that same year, she appeared on the CBS television special, &quot;I Get That a Lot&quot;, as a girl working at a pizza shop. That same year, she appeared in advertising for Dannon&#x27;s Light &amp; Fit brand.

Klum and husband Seal announced in June 2010 that they would be making a reality series on Lifetime titled &quot;Love&#x27;s Divine&quot; (after Seal&#x27;s song of the same name.) In January 2010, Klum launched two lines of maternity wear: Lavish by Heidi Klum for A Pea in the Pod, and Loved by Heidi Klum for Motherhood Maternity.

Klum is an artist, and she had several of her paintings appear in various art magazines in the US. On 27 September 2002, she dedicated a sculpture she painted called &quot;Dog with Butterflies&quot; to commemorate the role of rescue dogs in the aftermath of 11 September. In 2004, Klum co-authored &quot;Heidi Klum&#x27;s Body of Knowledge&quot; with &quot;Elle&quot; magazine editor Alexandra Postman. The book gives Klum&#x27;s biography as well as her advice on becoming successful. Prior to that, Klum had been an occasional guest columnist for the German television network RTL&#x27;s website. She wrote an essay for the German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot;.

In November 2006, Klum released her debut single &quot;Wonderland&quot;, written for a series of television advertisements for the German retailer Douglas. Proceeds were given to a children&#x27;s charity in her hometown of Bergisch Gladbach. She contributed to her husband Seal&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;System&quot;, singing the duet &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, a song that Seal wrote for their wedding.

==Personal life==
In 1997, Klum married stylist Ric Pipino. The couple divorced in 2002. In March 2003, Klum began a relationship with Flavio Briatore, the Italian managing director of Renault’s Formula One team. In December she announced her pregnancy. Soon after, the two split and Klum began dating the musician Seal. Klum gave birth to daughter Leni in May 2004 in New York City. Seal was present for Leni&#x27;s birth, and according to Klum, Briatore is not involved in Leni&#x27;s life; she has stated emphatically that &quot;Seal is Leni&#x27;s father.&quot;

Klum and Seal got engaged in December 2004 on a glacier in Whistler, British Columbia, and married on 10 May 2005 on a beach in Mexico. They have three biological children together: sons born in September 2005 and November 2006, and a daughter born in October 2009. On 21 November 2009, Klum officially adopted Seal&#x27;s surname and became legally known as Heidi Samuel. Soon after, in December 2009, Seal officially adopted Leni, and her last name was changed to Samuel. During their marriage, Klum and Seal renewed their vows to one another each year on their anniversary in front of family and friends. On 22 January 2012, the couple announced that they were separating after almost seven years of marriage. She filed for divorce from Seal three months later on 6 April 2012. She also requested that her name be restored to her birth name of Heidi Klum. Their divorce was finalized on 14 October 2014.

Klum dated her bodyguard, Martin Kirsten, from 2012 to 2014. She started dating art curator Vito Schnabel in 2014. They broke up in 2017 after three years of dating.

In May 2018, Klum made public her relationship with Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz through Instagram posts and appearances at Cannes Film Festival. The two were first romantically linked in March of the same year. On 24 December 2018, after approximately one year of dating, Klum announced on her Instagram that she and Kaulitz were engaged and posted a picture of the couple where the ring was showing with the caption &quot;I SAID YES&quot; followed with a red heart emoji. Klum privately married Kaulitz in February 2019. The couple&#x27;s wedding ceremony was held on the yacht &quot;Christina O&quot; in Italy in August 2019.

In an interview with Ocean View, Klum has described herself as a nudist, stating &quot;I grew up very free... not hiding or feeling insecure about myself or my body. As much as I love wearing beautiful lingerie and clothes, I also love not wearing too much. It&#x27;s a free feeling that I&#x27;ve had since being a small child growing up in Germany. I had parents that never hid from me when they changed clothing or when I walked into the room. When we would go to the beach, my mom would sunbathe topless.&quot;

===Bomb threat during &quot;GNTM&quot; live finale===
During the live finale of the 10th season of &quot;Germany&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; in the Mannheim SAP Arena on 14 May 2015, a telephone call by a woman came in at 9:07 pm, threatening that a bomb would go off during the live show. The organizer decided to have the hall evacuated and then to call the police. In the meantime, the live broadcast had been canceled and a note was shown to the television viewers, stating that the show had been interrupted due to technical issues. Later on, a man was arrested after he came near Klum, issuing another bomb threat. Thereupon, she was evacuated along with her daughter Leni and the two other judges. A suspicious suitcase was found, which turned out to be a hoax.

==Philanthropy==

On 30 April 2011, Klum led Walk for Kids, a community 5K walk to raise funds as part of Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles community awareness efforts. In May 2014, Klum was honoured with the Crystal Cross Award of the American Red Cross for her charity work, most notably for her contributions to the Red Cross after Hurricane Sandy.

<doc id="276359" wikidata="Q230390" url="?curid=276359" title="Erika Eleniak">
<text>Erika Eleniak (born September 29, 1969) is an American-Canadian actress, &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate, and model known for her role in &quot;Baywatch&quot; as Shauni McClain. Her film debut was in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). She starred in the films &quot;The Blob&quot; (1988), &quot;Under Siege&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993).

==Early life==
Erika Eleniak was born in Glendale, California. Her father, Dale Alan Eleniak, is of Ukrainian descent and her mother, Iris Maya (Neggo) Arnold is of Estonian and German descent. Eleniak&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather, Wasyl Eleniak, was one of the first pioneer Ukrainian immigrants to settle in Canada.

==Career==
Eleniak&#x27;s first feature-film role was at age 12, in the 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; as the girl kissed by Elliott in the classroom scene. Her 10-year-old costar, Henry Thomas, told &quot;People&quot; magazine that he disliked filming the scene: “When I had to kiss the girl, I had to do it two times! I don’t like girls.&quot;

In 1988 she appeared as Vicki De Soto, a victim of the creature in the horror film &quot;The Blob&quot;, which was a remake of the 1958 film of the same name.

Eleniak appeared in the July 1989 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; in a pictorial with a nautical theme. That same year, she began a recurring role in the TV series &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; as Charles&#x27;s girlfriend Stephanie Curtis, and also won a role on &quot;Baywatch&quot; as female lead Shauni McClain, which she played from 1989 to 1992. She also played Carrie, the high-school girlfriend of Jesse (John Stamos), in &quot;One Last Kiss&quot;, the November 16, 1990 episode of &quot;Full House&quot;.

In 1992, Eleniak returned to film acting, playing a &quot;Playboy &quot;Playmate hired to perform a striptease for the captain of a U.S. Navy battleship in &quot;Under Siege&quot;. In the film, she is described as &quot;Miss July 1989&quot;—the month that Eleniak was Playmate of the Month in real life.

She had a starring role as Elly May Clampett in the screen adaptation of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; in 1993. The next year, she starred in the Dennis Hopper-directed romantic comedy film &quot;Chasers&quot; with William McNamara. Eleniak shot another movie with McNamara, &quot;Girl in the Cadillac&quot; (1995), and starred as identical twins in the interactive 1995 video game &quot;Panic in the Park&quot;. She continued to make more independent films until 2003.

Eleniak appeared on the reality television series &quot;The Real Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; in June 2005.

Eleniak has suffered from weight issues. At one point, she was underweight due to an eating disorder and was once hospitalized for laxative abuse. By 2006, she was overweight and participated in the fourth season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;.

In 2006, she appeared on &quot;&#x27;80s Movie and Music Fest Cafe&quot;, a British comedy podcast on iTunes, in which she discussed her career with presenters Ross Dyer and Julian Bayes. She gave a lighthearted view of &quot;Baywatch&quot; and her challenge during filming of &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;.

==Personal life==
Eleniak was once engaged to her &quot;Baywatch&quot; co-star Billy Warlock, who had played her love interest on the show, as well. Eleniak married bodybuilder Philip Goglia on May 22, 1998, but after just six months, the marriage ended in divorce. After filming &quot;Snowbound&quot; in 2001 in Calgary, Alberta, Eleniak became enamored of the city. She began dating Roch Daigle, a key grip who worked on the set. She had wanted to leave Los Angeles as she found commuting to and from Telluride, Colorado, difficult. She purchased a home in Calgary, where Daigle lived. The two eventually married. Eleniak became pregnant in 2005, but six and a half weeks into her term, the pregnancy was discovered to be ectopic, which required emergency surgery, and ended in a miscarriage. Eleniak later became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter.

<doc id="276361" wikidata="Q212531" url="?curid=276361" title="Kate Moss">
<text>Katherine Ann Moss (born 16 January 1974) is an English model. Arriving towards the end of the &quot;supermodel era&quot;, Moss rose to fame in the early 1990s as part of the heroin chic fashion trend. Her collaborations with Calvin Klein brought her to fashion icon status. She is known for her waifish figure, and role in size zero fashion. Moss has had her own clothing range, has been involved in musical projects, and is also a contributing fashion editor for British &quot;Vogue&quot;. In 2012, she came second on the &quot;Forbes&quot; top-earning models list, with estimated earnings of $9.2 million in one year. The accolades she has received for modelling include the 2013 British Fashion Awards acknowledging her contribution to fashion over 25 years, while &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people in 2007. 

A subject of media scrutiny due to her partying lifestyle, Moss was involved in a drug use scandal in September 2005, which led to her being dropped from fashion campaigns. She was cleared of charges and soon resumed modelling. She has inspired cultural depictions including a £1.5m ($2.8m) 18 carat gold statue of her, sculpted in 2008 for a British Museum exhibition.

==Early life==
Kate Moss was born on 16 January 1974 in Croydon, Greater London, the daughter of Linda Rosina Moss (&quot;née&quot; Shepherd), a barmaid, and Peter Edward Moss, an airline employee, and raised in the Addiscombe and Sanderstead areas of the borough. She has a younger brother, Nick, and a half-sister named Lottie (Charlotte). Moss&#x27;s parents divorced when she was 13. She attended Ridgeway Primary School and Riddlesdown High School (now Riddlesdown Collegiate) in Purley. She worked several local retail jobs in her early teens.

==Career==
===Beginnings and &quot;heroin chic&quot; fashion===
Moss was recruited as a model in 1988 at age 14 by Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Management, at JFK Airport in New York, after a holiday in The Bahamas. Corinne Day shot black-and-white photographs of her, styled by Melanie Ward, for &quot;The Face&quot; when she was 16, in a shoot titled &quot;The 3rd Summer of Love&quot;. Moss was presented as a young unknown, and Day described the pictures as &quot;dirty realism&quot; or &quot;grunge&quot;.

Moss then featured in the Levi&#x27;s campaign &#x27;Levi&#x27;s for Girls&#x27;, with great success, set up by The Design Corporation and again shot by Corinne Day. A further shoot followed for &quot;The Face&quot;, by Tony Briggs, entitled &quot;Haute Coiffure&quot;, Moss went on to become the &quot;anti-supermodel&quot; of the 1990s in contrast to the models of the moment, such as Cindy Crawford, Elle Macpherson, Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell, who were known for curvaceous and tall figures.

Moss featured in the fashion look heroin chic in 1996 (which prompted speculation over her weight) with a campaign for Calvin Klein. Then-US President Bill Clinton spoke out against the trend. Moss said, &quot;It was just the time. It was a swing from more buxom girls like Cindy Crawford and people were shocked to see what they called a &#x27;waif&#x27;. What can you say? How many times can you say &#x27;I&#x27;m not anorexic&#x27;?&quot;

===Drug use ===

On 20 September 2005, the Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M dropped her from its campaign of autumn clothes designed by Stella McCartney after pictures were published of Moss using cocaine. The contract was reportedly worth £4 million a year. A day later, Chanel said it would not renew its contract with Moss, which was to expire that October, although its decision had nothing to do with the drug scandal. Burberry dropped Moss&#x27;s campaign with them. Moss apologised, though stopped short of admitting drug use. In 2022, she commented &quot;everybody I knew took drugs&quot;.

Moss appeared in ad campaigns for Dior. She was on the cover of the November 2005 &quot;W&quot; and also inside in a multi-page fashion shoot. She was defended by designer Alexander McQueen, who, during his walk-out after a fashion show, wore a T-shirt saying &quot;We love you Kate&quot;. In March 2006, she appeared in the finale of his show &quot;The Widows of Culloden&quot;, as a life-sized illusion projected into a glass pyramid. Artist Stella Vine also supported Moss, and paintings by Vine, painted during the scandal, were exhibited and reproduced in the press.

On 5 January 2006, the London Metropolitan Police asked Moss to return from the US to Britain to answer questions about the September 2005 cocaine scandal. On 16 June 2006, British police dropped the charges for lack of evidence. Ultimately, Moss was cleared of all charges and resumed her modelling career. In 2015 Moss was escorted off an EasyJet flight by police after she became disruptive.

===Later work===
Moss has been featured in ad campaigns with Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Balmain, Versace, Balenciaga, Burberry, Stuart Weitzman, Rag &amp; Bone, Alexander Wang, David Yurman, Givenchy, Roberto Cavalli, Kerastase, Isabel Marant, Yves Saint Laurent, Dior, Gucci, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Calvin Klein, Alexander McQueen, Equipment, Rimmel, and Bulgari. She has been on the cover and in fashion spreads for most magazines including UK, US, and French &quot;Vogue&quot; (as well as other international versions of &quot;Vogue&quot;), &quot;Another Man&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;the Face&quot;, and &quot;W&quot;. She has been on the cover of British &quot;Vogue&quot; 30 times, shot the inaugural covers for both Russian &quot;Vogue&quot; with Amber Valletta and Japanese &quot;Vogue&quot;, in addition to dozens of other international &quot;Vogue&quot; covers.

Moss has been on the cover of 17 issues of &quot;W&quot;, including one with nine different covers that featured her. &quot;W&quot; named Moss its muse (September 2003 issue). Moss has also featured on the inaugural covers of &quot;Numéro&quot;, &quot;Numéro&quot; Tokyo and Spanish &quot;L&#x27;Officiel&quot;. She has worked extensively with photographers such as Mario Testino, Mario Sorrenti, Steven Klein, Juergen Teller, Steven Meisel and Peter Lindbergh, and won the &quot;Vogue&quot;/CFDA award from the Fashion Designers of America in July 2005 as Fashion Inspiration.
April 2005 saw the launch of a Rimmel London mascara TV ad featuring leather-clad Moss motorcycling through London to the rock song &quot;Another Cold Beer&quot; by Steven Crayn.
Twelve months after her cocaine scandal, Moss signed 18 contracts for autumn-winter 2006 including Rimmel, Agent Provocateur, Virgin Mobile, Calvin Klein and Burberry. Moss designed a collection, with Katy England, for Topshop. Moss launched a fragrance and body lotion range bearing her name in association with Coty in 2007.
In November 2006, Moss was model of the year at the British Fashion Awards, the top accolade in British fashion, but the award stirred fresh controversy.
On 1 May 2007, clothes designed by Moss for Topshop were launched in the chain&#x27;s 225 UK stores. A Moss &quot;countdown to launch&quot; board filled a window of the company&#x27;s Oxford Street store and on 30 April Moss launched the clothing there, briefly appearing in the window modelling a red dress from the collection just before the shop opened. Topshop reportedly paid Moss £3 million. The 50 designs included clothes, bags, shoes and belts, prices from £12 for a vest top to £150 for a cropped leather jacket. Clothes included skinny jeans, one-shoulder minidresses and T-shirts with &quot;K&quot; woven into the design. In a collaboration with Coty, Moss has released four fragrances.

In early 2010, she designed handbags for Longchamp.
In 2012, Moss modelled for the spring-summer collection for Supreme.
Moss has represented Mango since 2011. In November 2012, Australian model Miranda Kerr replaced Moss for spring/summer 2013.

In January 2012, having seen Dutch illusionist Hans Klok on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;, Moss recommended Stella McCartney book him for London Fashion Week the following month. It was planned that Moss, a magic fan, would be Klok&#x27;s assistant, and she rehearsed three illusions, a levitation, a sawing in half and a guillotine illusion. However, she dropped out with temporary paralysis of her right arm due to a trapped nerve, and her place was taken by Alexa Chung.

Also in 2012, Moss appeared in the video of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;White Light&quot;, inspired by his pneumonia.
Moss performed with Naomi Campbell in the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games on 12 August 2012.

Moss posed nude for the 60th-anniversary issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; in December 2013. That same month, she received a Special Recognition award at the British Fashion Awards to acknowledge her contribution to fashion during her 25-year career. At the 2014 Brit Awards in February, Moss collected David Bowie&#x27;s Brit Award for Best British Male, while wearing a one-piece printed &quot;woodland creatures&quot; costume, as worn originally by Bowie. On 30 April 2014, Moss&#x27;s second collection for Topshop was unveiled. Her first collection with Topshop resulted in a long-lasting relationship with the brand.

In September 2016, Moss founded Kate Moss Agency (KMA). Her clients include Rita Ora, Jordan Barrett and Esmé Creed-Miles.

==Public image==
Moss was voted 9th of &quot;Maxim&quot; &quot;50 Sexiest Women of 1999&quot; and 22nd in &quot;FHM&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women of 1995&quot;. &quot;Arena&quot; named her sexiest woman in its 150th issue. She was on the November 1999 Millennium cover of American &quot;Vogue&quot; as one of the &quot;Modern Muses&quot;. In March 2007, Moss won the &quot;Sexiest Woman&quot; NME Award. 
In 2012 she was included on MODELS.com&#x27;s &#x27;The Supers&#x27; list.
While not officially confirmed by either, Noel Gallagher was speculated to have written the popular Oasis single &quot;Sunday Morning Call&quot; about her. The song reached number 4 in the UK and number 3 in Scotland. 

Moss was the subject of an expressionist nude painting by artist Lucian Freud, who painted her in 2002 while she was pregnant. The work sold at Christie&#x27;s in 2005 for £3.93 million. In 2007, Chuck Close created a portrait of her, translating daguerreotypes of Moss into Jacquard tapestry. In October 2010, she appeared on the cover of Bryan Ferry&#x27;s album &quot;Olympia&quot;. The National Portrait Gallery, London maintains seven portraits of Moss among its collections, shot by photographers including Mario Testino, Corinne Day and Sølve Sundsbø.

A £1.5m ($2.8m) 18 carat gold statue of Moss in 2008 was part of a British Museum exhibition. Entitled &quot;Siren&quot;, the hollow statue was made by Marc Quinn, who described Moss as &quot;the ideal beauty of the moment&quot;. The statue is said to be the largest gold statue to be created since the era of Ancient Egypt.
Quinn had previously made a painted-bronze, life-size sculpture of Moss in a contorted yoga pose, titled &quot;Sphinx&quot;.

The cello rock group Rasputina had a song entitled &quot;Kate Moss&quot; on their 1996 album &quot;Thanks for the Ether&quot;.

Moss has earned awards for style, including the Council of Fashion Designers of America&#x27;s fashion influence award and a place on the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; international best-dressed list. In the early part of the 21st century, she was, together with actress Sienna Miller, one of the main proponents of boho-chic. She appeared on the cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s September 2006 style issue. In recent years, she has popularised denim cutoff shorts, Ugg boots and the Balenciaga handbag.

In 2008, Moss was added to PETA&#x27;s &#x27;Worst-Dressed&#x27; Celebrities of 2008&#x27; because of her frequent use of fur. In 2012, Moss was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.

In 2013, the Belgian pop singer Stromae wrote Kate Moss into the lyrics of the song &quot;Tous les mêmes&quot;, singing &quot;il n&#x27;y a que Kate Moss qui est éternelle&quot;, translating into English as, &quot;there&#x27;s only Kate Moss who is eternal&quot;.

Moss was interviewed by &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; in 2009 and was quoted saying the phrase &quot;Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels&quot;, which she described as a &quot;motto&quot;. She was heavily criticised for the phrase, being &quot;accused of encouraging eating disorders&quot;. Moss later regretted saying it.

==Other ventures==

Moss appeared on Oasis singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot; (1998) and &quot;Fade Away&quot; (1994), and on the &quot;Be Here Now&quot; album (1997), playing tambourine, Johnny Depp playing a guitar.
She has appeared in music videos such as &quot;Kowalski&quot; by Primal Scream, &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot; by the White Stripes, &quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot; by Elton John, &quot;Sex with Strangers&quot; by Marianne Faithfull, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot; by Stage Dolls, &quot;Delia&#x27;s Gone&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot; by Johnny Cash, and &quot;Queenie Eye&quot; by Paul McCartney.

She has also provided vocals for songs by Primal Scream (the 2003 version of &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot;), Babyshambles (&quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot;) and the Lemonheads (&quot;You&#x27;re a Dirty Robot&quot;). Prior to breaking up with Pete Doherty, Moss co-wrote four songs on Babyshambles&#x27; second album &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot;—&quot;You Talk&quot;, &quot;French Dog Blues&quot;, &quot;Baddie&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, and &quot;Deft Left Hand&quot;.

In 1999, Moss played a non musical role in the British screen comedy &quot;&quot;, appearing both as Maid Marian and as a fictional Queen of England. Director and writer Richard Curtis said in the &quot;making of&quot; video that they wanted &quot;the best looking woman in England&quot; to play the role. In 2014, she made an acting cameo as herself in &quot;The Boy in the Dress&quot;.

Moss has put her name to four perfume lines. Her first one, the original, is named &quot;Kate Moss&quot;. Other perfumes include Vintage Muse, Lila Belle and Love Blossoms.

A planned biopic film by James Lucas titled &quot;Moss and Freud&quot; about the creation of Freud&#x27;s painting of Moss was announced in 2022. The film will feature Ellie Bamber as Kate Moss and Derek Jacobi as Lucian Freud.

==Philanthropy==

Moss supported War Child. She also designed a charm in a necklace for Wallis in 2007 in aid of Cancer Research UK and said &quot;I am happy to give my support to help fund crucial research, as so many lives are affected by this terrible disease.&quot;

She has also helped to launch the SamandRuby charity in March 2006. The charity was started to provide funding for the education and shelter of Thai children. The SamandRuby organisation is named after a friend of Moss&#x27;s, Samantha Archer Fayet, and her 6-month-old daughter Ruby Rose who were killed by the tsunami while visiting Thailand.

Moss also supports the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the Hoping Foundation, the Lucie Blackman Trust, Make Poverty History, Comic Relief and Homes of Hope. On 22 November 2006, Moss recorded an appearance in a &quot;Little Britain&quot; sketch for Comic Relief at the Hammersmith Apollo as a character called Katie Pollard, sister of Vicky Pollard played by Matt Lucas.

Moss made a short film with Misery Bear for the March 2011 Comic Relief event entitled &quot;Misery Bear&#x27;s Comic Relief Starring Kate Moss&quot;.

In November 2014, Moss designed a Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty created by various celebrities which were located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot;, with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

==Personal life==
Moss was in a relationship with actor Johnny Depp between 1994 and 1998. She has a daughter, Lila Moss (born Lila Grace Moss Hack, and who is also a model), born in September 2002, with &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; editor Jefferson Hack, with whom she was in a relationship for a number of years in the early 2000s. She is godmother to Sadie Frost and Jude Law&#x27;s daughter Iris Law.

Moss had a relationship with Libertines member Pete Doherty, first meeting him at her 31st birthday party in January 2005. On 11 April 2007, Doherty announced Moss as his fiancée during one of his concerts in London, at which Moss also performed. In July 2007, Moss and Doherty split.

Moss married Jamie Hince, guitarist of The Kills, on 1 July 2011 at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Southrop in Gloucestershire; she wore a dress by John Galliano. Moss and Hince split in 2015 and settled their divorce out of court in 2016. She has since been in a relationship with British photographer Count Nikolai von Bismarck of the German aristocratic family. 

In 2011, Moss bought 3, The Grove, Highgate, as her London home, selling it in 2022 to relocate to the Cotswolds.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, her 2004–2005 earnings were $5 million and her 2005–2006 earnings were $8 million. In 2007, with estimated earnings of $9 million, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named her second on the list of the World&#x27;s 15 top-earning models list. She made her first appearance in the British women&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2007, where she was estimated to be worth £45 million. She ranked as the 99th richest woman in Britain.
In the 2009 Rich List, she was ranked as the 1,348th richest person in the UK, with a net worth of £40 million.

Moss is sober.

<text>Carol Ann Alt (born December 1, 1960) is an American model and actress.

==Early life==
Alt was born in Flushing, Queens, New York, the daughter of Muriel, an airline employee and model, and Anthony Alt, a battalion chief from the 18th Battalion (South Bronx) of the New York City Fire Department. She was noticed waiting tables in East Williston, Long Island, and decided at age 18 to give modeling a try as a summer job to save money for college. She is the third of four children. She has an older brother, Anthony Jr. (1955–2005), an older sister Karen and a younger sister, Christine. Alt&#x27;s maternal grandparents were German immigrants, while her paternal grandmother was Irish.

==Career==
Alt&#x27;s first big break in modeling was in 1979, when she was featured on the cover of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine, but garnered publicity in 1982 when she was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. During the 1980s, she appeared on over 500 magazine covers, becoming one of the most famous models of her era, attaining supermodel status. Alt graced the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vogue Paris&quot;, &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;, &quot;Vogue UK&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. She was referred to as The Face by &quot;Life Magazine&quot;. During the height of her popularity, she was the face of ad campaigns for Diet Pepsi, General Motors, Cover Girl Cosmetics, Noxzema, Hanes, Givenchy, Versace, Armani and numerous others. She was the first model to produce her own posters and calendars.

Since 1986, she has appeared in a variety of films, many of which were Italian productions. She played the character of Kelly LaRue in the TV series &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; in 1994. She played Agent Monica McBride in a 1997 action film &quot;The Protector&quot;, opposite Matt McColm, and Karen Oldham in the television adaptation of Peter Benchley&#x27;s &quot;Amazon&quot; (1999). She also had a few minor television roles, including one episode of &quot;Wings&quot;, and a voice role in an episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. In 2004 she had a starring role in &quot;Snakehead Terror&quot;, a Canadian film. She starred in the Italian TV series &quot;Caterina e le sue figlie 2&quot; and in the TV movie &quot;Piper&quot;; both were aired on Canale5 in 2007. In 2009 she was one of the contestants of the Italian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (Rai Uno). &quot;Piper — The series&quot;, a spinoff of the successful TV movie of the same title was broadcast on Canale5 that same year. 

She took on a number of model/spokesman projects, including becoming a consultant with the &quot;Le Mirador&quot; skin-care line and appearing on late night TV infomercials. Alt has written two books, promoting her own raw food diet plans. She was the cover girl for &quot;travelgirl magazine&quot; (in 2004 and 2008). She appeared on the cover and in a nude pictorial in Playboy&#x27;s December 2008 issue. She placed #5 on askmen.com&#x27;s list of Top 10 Models of All Time.

In 2006, Alt was honored as Grand Marshal at the German-American Steuben Parade in New York City, the largest celebration of German–American Friendship in the United States. She was greeted by thousands of fans alongside Fifth Avenue. She was a contestant on NBC&#x27;s 2008 &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, with Donald Trump, competing for her charity, the Tony Alt Memorial Foundation (named for Alt&#x27;s father), which raises funds for scholarships for young adults to continue their studies. She ended up in third place before being fired, but was brought back for the final task of the show and was chosen by finalist Piers Morgan to help him to become the Celebrity Apprentice. Alt raised a total of $40,000 for her charity. In 2008 she also founded Raw Essentials, a skin-care and beauty products line with her partners (Philip Masiello and Steven Krane).

In 2001, Alt appeared on the U.S. version of &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,&quot; playing for charity. 
In September 2013, Alt joined the Fox News team with her own half-hour Saturday afternoon TV show, &quot;A Healthy You &amp; Carol Alt&quot;, which covers her own experience and knowledge about wellness and longevity. Each installment ends with a segment called Ask Carol, in which she answers questions she receives on Facebook and Twitter. In October 2013, Alt was inducted into the Ride of Fame. A double decker New York City tour bus was dedicated to her and her career.

In 2015 Alt co-starred in the Lifetime shoplifting comedy &quot;Stealing Chanel&quot; with Lydia Hearst, Anna Maria Cianciulli, and John Rothman.

==Personal life==
Alt married former New York Rangers defenseman Ron Greschner at St. Aidan&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, in Williston Park, Long Island, New York, in 1983. They divorced in 1996. Alt was then in a long-term relationship with former New York Islanders forward Alexei Yashin.

<doc id="276363" wikidata="Q6304332" url="?curid=276363" title="Union and Security Act">
<text>The Union and Security Act (, ), alternatively Act of Union and Security, was proposed by King Gustav III of Sweden to the assembled Estates of the Realm during the Riksdag of 1789. It was a document, adding to the Swedish Constitution of 1772 new provisions. The King strengthened his grip on power while at the same time riding on a popular wave that also meant a decrease in aristocratic power. It has been described as &quot;fundamentally conservative&quot;.

==Passage==
During the Russo-Swedish War, in February 1789, Gustav summoned the Riksdag of the Estates and placed an Act of Union and Security before them. Three of the four estates accepted it, but the Nobles rejected it. Since three of the four Estates accepted it, it was passed and became law.

==Contents==
The Act of Union and Security gave the King the sole power to declare war and make peace instead of sharing the power with the estates and the Privy Council. The estates would lose the ability to initiate legislation, but they would keep the ability to vote on new taxes.

Another provision was that the King was enabled to determine the number of Privy Councillors and so he could abolish the Council altogether by determining their number to be zero. The judicial branch of the Privy Council (in ) was then transferred to a new Supreme Court.

Most noble privileges were abolished with the Act, with most offices now available to all regardless of rank. Noble lands could now be bought by anyone instead of only by nobles.

The law was in effect in Sweden until 1809, and in Finland until 1919.

<doc id="276370" wikidata="Q115506" url="?curid=276370" title="Eugen Bleuler">
<text>Paul Eugen Bleuler ( ; ; 30 April 1857 – 15 July 1939) was a Swiss psychiatrist and eugenicist most notable for his influence on modern concepts of mental illness. He coined several psychiatric terms including &quot;schizophrenia&quot;, &quot;schizoid&quot;, &quot;autism&quot;, depth psychology and what Sigmund Freud called &quot;Bleuler&#x27;s happily chosen term &quot;ambivalence&quot;&quot;. Bleuler remains a controversial figure in psychiatric history for his racist, sanist, and ableist beliefs, as well as his implementation of eugenic practises in psychiatry based on these beliefs, most notably at the Burghölzli clinic in Zurich.

==Personal life==
Bleuler was born in Zollikon, a town near Zürich in Switzerland, to Johann Rudolf Bleuler (1823–1898), a wealthy farmer, and Pauline Bleuler-Bleuler (1829–1898). He married Hedwig Bleuler-Waser, one of the first women to receive her doctorate from the University of Zurich.

==Career==
Bleuler studied medicine in Zürich. He trained for his psychiatric residency at Waldau Hospital under Gottlieb Burckhardt, a Swiss psychiatrist, from 1881 to 1884. He left his job in 1884 and spent one year on medical study trips with Jean-Martin Charcot, a French neurologist in Paris, Bernhard von Gudden, a German psychiatrist in Munich, and to London. After these trips, he returned to Zürich to briefly work as assistant to Auguste Forel while completing his psychiatric residency at the Burghölzli, a university hospital.

Bleuler became the director of a psychiatric clinic in Rheinau, a hospital located in an old monastery on an island in the Rhine. At the time, the clinic was known for being functionally backward and largely ineffective. Because of this, Bleuler set about improving conditions for the patients residing there.

In the year 1898, Bleuler returned to the Burghölzli and became a psychiatry professor at Burghölzli, the same university hospital at which he completed his residency. He was also appointed director of the mental asylum in Rheinau. He served as the director from the years 1898 to 1927. While working at this asylum, Bleuler cared for long-term psychiatric patients. He also implemented both psychoanalytic treatment and research, and was influenced by Sigmund Freud.

During his time as the director of psychiatry at Burghölzli, Bleuler made great contributions to the field of psychiatry and psychology that made him known today. Given these findings, Bleuler has been described as one of the most influential Swiss psychiatrists.

==Relationship with Freud and Jung==
Following his interest in hypnotism, especially in its &quot;introspective&quot; variant, Bleuler became interested in Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work. He favorably reviewed Josef Breuer and Freud&#x27;s &quot;Studies on Hysteria&quot;.

Like Freud, Bleuler believed that complex mental processes could be unconscious. He encouraged his staff at the Burghölzli to study unconscious and psychotic mental phenomena. Influenced by Bleuler, Carl Jung and Franz Riklin used word association tests to integrate Freud&#x27;s theory of repression with empirical psychological findings. As a series of letters demonstrates, Bleuler performed a self-analysis with Freud, beginning in 1905. Bleuler laid the foundation for a less fatalistic view of the course and outcome of psychotic disorders along with C. G. Jung, who further used Bleuler&#x27;s theory of ambivalence and association experiments to diagnose neurotic illnesses. 
Bleuler found Freud&#x27;s movement to be overly dogmatic and resigned from the International Psychoanalytic Association in 1911, writing to Freud that &quot;this &#x27;all or nothing&#x27; is in my opinion necessary for religious communities and useful for political parties...but for science I consider it harmful&quot;.
Bleuler remained interested in Freud&#x27;s work, citing him favorably, for example, in his often reprinted &quot;Textbook of Psychiatry&quot; (1916). He also supported the nomination of Freud for the Nobel Prize in the late twenties.

==&quot;Dementia Praecox, or the Group of Schizophrenias&quot;==
Bleuler introduced the term &quot;schizophrenia&quot; in a Berlin lecture on 24 April 1908. However, he and his colleagues had been using the term in Zurich to replace Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s term dementia praecox since 1907. He revised and expanded his schizophrenia concept in his seminal study of 1911, &quot;Dementia Praecox, oder Gruppe der Schizophrenien&quot; (&quot;Dementia Praecox, or Group of Schizophrenias&quot;). This was translated into English in 1950 (by Joseph Zinkin).

Bleuler distinguished between positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms include symptoms not found in unaffected people, such as hallucinations or delusions. Negative symptoms describe the absence of typical experiences such as social withdrawal or lack of pleasure. Bleuler also distinguished between basic and accessory symptoms as well as primary and secondary symptoms. Basic symptoms are those that are present in every case of schizophrenia, whereas accessory symptoms vary depending on the patient. Bleuler defined primary symptoms as those that are directly related to neurobiological processes. He defined secondary symptoms as behavioral reactions to primary symptoms. Differentiating these symptoms contributed to an increased understanding of schizophrenia in general.

Like Kraepelin, Bleuler argued that dementia praecox, or &quot;the schizophrenias&quot;, was a physical disease process characterized by exacerbations and remissions. He argued that no one was ever completely &quot;cured&quot; of schizophrenia; there was always some sort of lasting cognitive weakness or defect that was manifest in behavior. Unlike Kraepelin, Bleuler believed that the overall prognosis was not uniformly grim. He believed &quot;dementia&quot; was a secondary symptom not directly caused by the underlying biological process. There were three other &quot;fundamental symptoms&quot; that included deficits in associations, affectivity, and ambivalence. He believed the biological disease was much more prevalent in the population due to its &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;latent&quot; forms.

Bleuler&#x27;s changes to Kraepelin&#x27;s dementia praecox were accepted by countries such as Switzerland and Britain. However, some countries, such as Germany, did not accept these changes at first. Bleuler&#x27;s concept of schizophrenia was pushed aside due to its similarities to Kraepelin&#x27;s dementia praecox. It was only widely accepted after Kraepelin&#x27;s disease classification did not have direct evidence nor was it directly expressed in his patients.

In 1911, Bleuler wrote, &quot;When the disease process flares up, it is more correct, in my view, to talk in terms of deteriorating attacks, rather than its recurrence. Of course the term recurrence is more comforting to a patient and his relatives than the notion of progressively deteriorating attacks&quot;. The eugenic sterilization of persons diagnosed with (and viewed as predisposed to) schizophrenia was advocated by Bleuler. He argued that racial deterioration would result from the propagation of &quot;mental and physical cripples&quot; In his &quot;Textbook of Psychiatry&quot;, Bleuler states,
In 1917, Bleuler discussed the heredity involved in schizophrenia after psychiatrist Ernst Rudin published his findings. Bleuler agreed with Rudin that having a family member with schizophrenia increases an individual&#x27;s chance of also having the disease. However, Bleuler found that Rudin&#x27;s study did not use sufficient sampling methods, threatening the integrity of the study. While researching further, Bleuler made several conclusions that differed from Rudin&#x27;s. First, that the schizophrenic gene was not a dominant trait. Second, the disease involves a dihybrid, complex gene and does not include a monohybrid gene. Bleuler also said that there may be a polymorphic aspect to schizophrenia, meaning it presents itself in different forms.

Bleuler found that in order for schizophrenia to present itself in patients, several elements must come together. He found that there are a wide variety of symptoms associated with schizophrenia that can lead to a potential diagnosis. Bleuler concluded that several aspects of the disease are not genetically inherited. These tend to be behavioral aspects and positive symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and strange ideas.

He believed the disease&#x27;s central characteristics were the product of splitting between the emotional and the intellectual functions of the personality. He favored early discharge from hospital into a community environment to avoid institutionalization.

==Further contributions==
Bleuler also explored the concept of moral idiocy, and the relationship between neurosis and alcoholism. He followed Freud&#x27;s perspective of seeing sexuality as a potent influence upon anxiety, pondered on the origins of the sense of guilt, and studied the process of what he defined as &quot;switching&quot; (the affective shift from love to hate, for example).

Bleuler was known for his clinical observation and willingness to let symptoms speak for themselves. He was also known for his skillful expository writings. Bleuler has never been credited with healing his patients. Like Sigmund Freud he experimented on patients in his care; many were sterilised and many committed suicide.

Later in his life, Bleuler studied and published works on psychoids. He defined the psychoid as the capacity to respond and adapt to stimuli, creating permanent changes in the brain and shaping future reactions. Bleuler believed the psychoid to be a cause of psychic development. He also proposed that social, mental, and physical aspects of life are not separate from each other but instead are seen as aspects of a sole life principle. These ideas were not particularly popular among the scientific community and did not receive a great deal of attention.

==Criticism==
=== Eugenics ===

Like his predecessor Auguste Forel—Eugen Bleuler also held eugenic and racist beliefs. He promoted and initiated forced sterilizations and castrations of psychiatric patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
Bleuler believed that preventing these individuals from reproducing would help preserve racial purity.
Under his direction at the Burghölzli clinic in Zurich, expert reports were produced supporting surgical interventions on eugenic grounds. 

In his seminal 1911 work, &quot;Dementia Praecox, or the Group of Schizophrenias&quot;, Bleuler wrote: &quot;Castration, of course, is of no benefit to the patients themselves. However, it is to be hoped that sterilization will soon be employed on a larger scale... for eugenic reasons.&quot; These practices were part of a broader movement in early 20th-century psychiatry that endorsed eugenic policies, influencing Bleuler’s implementation of such practices in psychiatric care.

Bleuler&#x27;s advocacy for eugenic sterilization significantly contributed to the widespread adoption of these practices in psychiatric institutions, most notably at the Burghölzli Clinic.

=== Bleuler and the Medicalization of Schizophrenia ===
Despite being a physician dedicated to healing, Bleuler conceptualized schizophrenia as a chronic and incurable illness, creating a contradiction at the core of his medical philosophy. While a doctor&#x27;s role is to diagnose in order to treat and heal, Bleuler’s classification of schizophrenia as an irreversible condition, placed it outside the scope of medicine’s ability to cure however, reinforcing the idea that those diagnosed were beyond help.

This paradox is particularly striking given that Bleuler expanded on Emil Kraepelin’s concept of dementia praecox while rejecting its strictly degenerative prognosis. Although he acknowledged some variability in outcomes, he still framed schizophrenia as a disorder characterized by a &quot;split&quot; from reality that could not be fundamentally reversed. 
This perspective contributed to the medicalization of psychiatric conditions in a way that justified eugenic interventions—such as sterilization—rather than treatment focused on recovery. This perspective played a significant role in the medicalization of psychiatric conditions, contributing to a framework that justified eugenic interventions—such as sterilization—rather than treatments focused on recovery. By framing schizophrenia as an irreversible condition, Bleuler reinforced a medical model that prioritized control and segregation over healing and reintegration.

In this same vein, he developed what he called &#x27;Udenotherapy (also spelled Oudenotherapy, from the ancient Greek οὐδεν (ouden) meaning “nothing” and θεραπεία (therapeia) meaning “service, care, healing”). This term reflected his belief that illnesses should not be treated with immediate, active intervention but rather by allowing their natural course to unfold, observing passively their decline, with the hope that recovery could occur. However, waiting for symptoms to resolve without intervention risks being viewed as neglect rather than compassionate care. 

Institutional therapy under his direction was primarily based on work and occupational engagement. Patients were trained in self-discipline, and in severe cases, subjected to behavioral conditioning. Discharge required suppressing and controlling disruptive secondary symptoms, a process Bleuler and his successors referred to as &quot;socialization&quot;.

By defining schizophrenia as a fixed biological defect rather than a dynamic condition with potential for improvement, Bleuler helped shape psychiatric practices with severe consequences for patients:

• Involuntary commitment and Institutionalization – His theories justified the long-term confinement of individuals with schizophrenia in asylums rather than efforts to reintegrate them into society.

• Eugenics and Sterilization – Framing schizophrenia as a hereditary, incurable illness provided justification for sterilization and other eugenic measures, which Bleuler supported.

• Shifting Focus from Recovery to Management – Instead of prioritizing treatment aimed at healing, the medical model of schizophrenia focused on long-term management, often through coercive and experimental methods. Many patients committed suicide as a result.

As a doctor, Bleuler was expected to seek cures rather than create a framework that solidified schizophrenia as an unhealable disorder. His approach aligned more with eugenics and social control than with the Hippocratic ideal of healing, making his legacy philosophically and ethically questionable to this day.

== Legacy ==
After Eugen Bleuler’s death, his son Manfred Bleuler continued his work. Beginning in 1937, he edited new editions of his father’s Textbook of Psychiatry, first published in 1916, which had already contained eugenic ideas. In the editions published in Germany in 1937 and 1943, Manfred Bleuler included articles by racial hygienists such as Hans Luxenburger and Friedrich Meggendorfer. In postwar editions of the widely respected textbook, these additions were removed and replaced with questionable references to psychiatric methods such as lobotomy (brain surgery) and neuroleptics (psychotropic medication).

The revision of the textbook after the war—removing references to eugenics and replacing them with methods like lobotomy and neuroleptics—can be interpreted as an attempt to distance the field of psychiatry from its eugenic past, but also raise questions about the ethics of covering up problematic history.
The introduction of lobotomy and neuroleptics after the war, while possibly aiming to reflect a shift in psychiatric treatments, also have contributed to harmful practices. Lobotomies, as well as Neuroleptics were deeply controversial despite their widespread use, and would later become subjects of ethical scrutiny due to concerns over their overuse, side effects, and questionable application in treating vulnerable patients.

<doc id="276372" wikidata="Q1723843" url="?curid=276372" title="Ram air turbine">
<text>A ram air turbine (RAT) is a small wind turbine that is connected to a hydraulic pump, or electrical generator, installed in an aircraft and used as a power source. The RAT generates power from the airstream by ram pressure due to the speed of the aircraft. It may be called an air driven generator (ADG) on some aircraft.

==Operation==
Modern aircraft generally use RATs only in an emergency. In case of the loss of both primary and auxiliary power sources the RAT will power vital systems (flight controls, linked hydraulics and also flight-critical instrumentation). Some RATs produce only hydraulic power, which is in turn used to power electrical generators. 

In some early aircraft (including airships), small RATs were permanently mounted and operated a small electrical generator or fuel pump. Some constant-speed propellers, such as those of the Argus As 410 engines used in the Focke-Wulf Fw 189, used a propeller turbine on the spinner to power a self-contained pitch governor controlling this constant speed.

Modern aircraft generate power in the main engines or an additional fuel-burning turbine engine called an auxiliary power unit, which is often mounted in the rear of the fuselage or in the main-wheel well. The RAT generates power from the airstream due to the speed of the aircraft. If aircraft speeds are low, the RAT will produce less power. In normal conditions the RAT is retracted into the fuselage (or wing), and is deployed manually or automatically following complete loss of power. In the time between power loss and RAT deployment, batteries are used.

==Military use==
RATs are common in military aircraft, which must be capable of surviving sudden and complete loss of power.

They also power pod-fitted systems such as the M61A1 Vulcan cannon. Some free-fall nuclear weapons, such as the British Yellow Sun and Red Beard, used RATs to power radar altimeters and firing circuits; these were a more reliable alternative to batteries.


===Wing mount===
High-powered electronics such as the AN/ALQ-99 jamming system can be self powered by a RAT in standard operation. This allows their installation on a standard hardpoint, without requiring a pod-specific power supply. As many as five AN/ALQ-99 systems with built in ram air turbines can be mounted on a Boeing EA-18G Growler, with two under each wing and one under the fuselage of the aircraft. Each AN/ALQ-99 contains two transmitters, each with its own directional antenna. They are used by the Electronic Attack Squadron 134 (VAQ-134). They are not retracted, staying deployed continuously during flight. 

== Civilian use ==

Many modern types of commercial airliners, from the Vickers VC10 of the 1960s, are equipped with RATs. A ram air turbine driving an electrical generator was chosen for the VC10 because of its use of &quot;packaged&quot; hydraulically powered flying controls, rather than a centralised hydraulic system. The individual package units of the VC10 were each powered electrically and so emergency redundancy for the VC10 relied on quadruple generators and a backup RAT generator at a time when most RATs drove hydraulic pumps.

The Airbus A380 has the largest RAT in the world at in diameter, but around is more common. A typical large RAT on a commercial aircraft can be capable of producing , depending on the generator. Smaller, low airspeed models may generate as little as 400 watts.

RATs have also been used to power centrifugal pumps to pressurize the spray systems on aircraft that are used as crop dusters to deliver liquid agents to cropland. The major reason for choosing a RAT is safety; using a RAT in the United States allows an FAA-certified engine and power systems on the aircraft to remain unmodified. There is no need to use an engine power takeoff to drive the pump, as the pump can be placed low or below the exterior of the airframe, greatly simplifying plumbing. Being the lowest point in the plumbing, it will have gravity feed from the spray tanks and never need to be primed. In the event of a pump failure that could result in seizure, there is no effect on the flying ability of the aircraft or its systems apart from the fact that the spray systems are non-functional.

<text>A wedding breakfast is a feast given to the newlyweds and guests after the wedding, making it equivalent to a wedding reception that serves a meal. The phrase is still used in British English.

Nowadays the wedding breakfast is not normally a morning meal, nor does it look like a typical breakfast, so its name can be confusing.

==Origin of the name==
The name is claimed to have arisen from the fact that in pre-Reformation times, the wedding service was usually a Eucharistic Mass and that the newlyweds would therefore have been fasting before the wedding in order to be eligible to receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. After the wedding ceremony was complete, the priest would bless and distribute some wine, cakes, and sweetmeats, which were then handed round to the company, including the newlyweds. This distribution of food and drink was therefore a literal &quot;break fast&quot; for the newly married couple, though others in attendance would not necessarily take Communion and therefore would not necessarily have been fasting. Since usage of the phrase cannot be shown to date back earlier than the first half of the 19th century however, a pre-16th-century origin seems unlikely.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; does not record any occurrences of the phrase &quot;wedding breakfast&quot; before 1850, but it was used at least as far back as 1838. 

The author of &quot;Party-giving on Every Scale&quot; (London, 1880) suggests the phrase may have evolved fifty years earlier:

==Current use==
The &quot;Compact Oxford Dictionary&quot; lists the phrase as only &quot;British&quot;, and the Merriam-Webster online dictionary does not list it at all.

The custom of the wedding breakfast is occasionally spotted in non-English-speaking countries that market themselves as wedding destinations, e.g. Poland.

<doc id="276380" wikidata="Q13424373" url="?curid=276380" title="Viceroy of Norway">
<text>The Viceroy of Norway (Constitutional Danish: Vice-Konge) was the appointed head of the Norwegian Government in the absence of the King, during the era of the Union between Sweden and Norway. The role was essentially the same as that of the Governor-general, which has led to confusion as to who filled which office. Decisive, however, is that the title of Viceroy could only be held by the crown prince, or his oldest son, when he had come of age. Commoners with a similar mandate were merely styled &quot;Statholder&quot; (Governor-general).

==History==
On 9 November 1814 the King appointed Crown Prince Carl Johan to the office, but it was vacated eight days later. Crown Prince Carl was the longest-serving Viceroy, sitting for about a year. The office was vacant most of the time, and it was ultimately abolished on 30 June 1891.

During the Kalmar Union, Christian II was viceroy from 1506 to 1513.

<doc id="276382" wikidata="Q537784" url="?curid=276382" title="Nuu-chah-nulth">
<text>The Nuu-chah-nulth ( ; ), also formerly referred to as the Nootka, Nutka, Aht, Nuuchahnulth or Tahkaht, are one of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast in Canada. The term Nuu-chah-nulth is used to describe fifteen related tribes whose traditional home is on the west coast of Vancouver Island.

In precontact and early post-contact times, the number of tribes was much greater, but the smallpox epidemics and other consequences of contact with Europeans resulted in the disappearance of some groups and the absorption of others into neighbouring groups. The Nuu-chah-nulth are related to the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, the Haisla, and the Ditidaht First Nation. The Nuu-chah-nulth language belongs to the Wakashan family.

The governing body is the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council.

==History==
===Contact with Europeans===
When James Cook first encountered the villagers at Yuquot in 1778, they directed him to &quot;come around&quot; (Nuu-chah-nulth &quot;nuutkaa&quot; is &quot;to circle around&quot;) with his ship to the harbour. Cook interpreted this as the First Nation&#x27;s name for the inlet, now called Nootka Sound. The term was also applied to the indigenous inhabitants of the area.

The Nuu-chah-nulth were among the first Pacific peoples north of California to encounter Europeans, who sailed into their area for trade, particularly the Maritime fur trade. Tensions flared up between Spain and Great Britain over control of Nootka Sound, which led to a bitter international dispute around 1790 known as the Nootka Crisis. It was settled under the Nootka Convention, in which Spain agreed to abandon its exclusive claims to the North Pacific coast. Negotiations to settle the dispute were handled under the aegis and hospitality of Maquinna, a powerful chief of the Mowachaht Nuu-chah-nulth.

A few years later, Maquinna and his warriors captured the American trading ship &quot;Boston&quot; in March 1803. He and his men killed the captain and all the crew but two, whom they kept as slaves. After gaining release, John R. Jewitt wrote a classic captivity narrative about his nearly 3 years with the Nuu-chah-nulth and his reluctant assimilation to their society. This 1815 book is titled &quot;Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt;, Only Survivor of the Crew of the Ship Boston, during a Captivity of Nearly Three Years among the Savages of Nootka Sound: With an Account of the Manners, Mode of Living, and Religious Opinions of the Natives.&quot; In the end, Jewitt escaped with the help of Wickaninnish, a chief from an opposing group.

In 1811 the trading ship &quot;Tonquin&quot; was blown up in Clayoquot Sound. Tla-o-qui-aht warriors had attacked the ship in revenge for an insult by the ship&#x27;s captain. The captain and almost all the crew were killed and the ship abandoned. The next day warriors reboarded the empty ship to salvage it. However, a hiding crew member set fire to the ship&#x27;s magazine and the resulting explosion killed many First Nation peoples. Only one crew member, a pilot / interpreter hired from the nearby Quinault nation, escaped to tell the tale.

From earliest contact with European and American explorers up until 1830, more than 90% of the Nuu-chah-nulth died as a result of infectious disease epidemics, particularly malaria and smallpox. Europeans and Americans were immune to these endemic diseases but the First Nations had no immunity to them (see Native American disease and epidemics). The high rate of deaths added to the social disruption and cultural turmoil resulting from contact with Westerners. In the early 20th century, the population was estimated at 3,500.

===20th century===
In 1979, the tribes of western Vancouver Island chose the term &quot;Nuu-chah-nulth&quot; (&quot;nuučaan̓uł&quot;, meaning &quot;all along the mountains and sea&quot;), as a collective term of identification. This was the culmination of the 1958 alliance forged among these tribes in order to present a unified political voice to the levels of government and European-Canadian society. In 1985, the Government of British Columbia signed an agreement to delegate authority for the delivery of Child Welfare Services to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth, making the Nuu-Chah-Nulth the first delegated aboriginal agency in British Columbia. The Makah of northwest Washington, located on the Olympic Peninsula in their own reservation, are also Nuu-chah-nulth.

===Research===
In the 1980s, scientists from outside the community recruited Nuu-chah-nulth people as research participants in genetic studies. Those studies used participant blood and other material for purposes which the community did not approve. In 2013, the community had those materials destroyed.

==Bands==
In the 20th century, recognised Nuu-chah-nulth band governments are:
#Ahousaht First Nation: (population over 2,000) formed from the merger of the Ahousaht and Kelthsmaht, Manhousaht, Qwatswiaht and Bear River bands in 1951;
#Ehattesaht First Nation; (population 294)
#Hesquiaht First Nation; (population 653)
#Kyuquot/Cheklesahht First Nation; (population 486)
#Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nations: (population 520) formerly the Nootka band;
#Nuchatlaht First Nation; (population 165)
#Huu-ay-aht First Nation: (formerly Ohiaht); (population 598)
#Hupacasath First Nation (formerly Opetchesaht); (256)
#Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations: (formerly Clayoquot); (population 881)
#Toquaht First Nation; (population 117)
#Tseshaht First Nation; (population 1002)
#Uchucklesaht First Nation; (population 181)
#Yuułuʔiłʔatḥ (Ucluelet First Nation); (population 606)

Total population for the 13 tribes in the Nuuchahnulth nation is 8,147, according to the Nuuchahnulth Tribal Council Indian Registry of February 2006.

The Ditidaht First Nation (population 690), while politically and culturally affiliated with the Nuu-chah-nulth, are independently referred to. In addition, the Pacheedaht First Nation are not politically affiliated with the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council.

==Culture==
===Whaling===

The Nuu-chah-nulth were one of the few Indigenous peoples on the Pacific Coast who hunted whales. Whaling is essential to Nuu-chah-nulth culture and spirituality. It is reflected in stories, songs, names, family lines, and numerous place names throughout their territories.

Carbon dating shows that the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples hunted whales over 4000 years ago for both blubber and meat. The Nuu-chah-nulth peoples hunted whales of different species due to the range of territory that they reside in and the migration pattern of the whales. Those most often caught would be either grey or humpback whales due to their more docile nature and how close they would come to the shore.

There is evidence that occasionally members of the Nuu-chah-nulth nations would hunt an orca despite the danger and difficulty as a way of showing bravery. Although it was a hazardous undertaking, those that ate “killer whale” regarded both its meat and blubber to be of higher quality than that of the larger whales.

While whaling provided the Nuu-chah-nulth nations with an important source of food and blubber - which could be rendered into oil - it also played an important role in social life as well. The chief would lead a whale hunting party that was made up of other prominent members of the community. The traditional whaling practices of the fourteen different Nuu-chah-nulth nations vary as each community has their own distinct traditions, ceremonies, and rituals. Some simplified examples of Nuu-chah-nulth whaling traditions include ceremonial bathing, abstinence, prayer, and ceremony which were to be performed before and after the hunt. These rituals were performed by the chief leading the hunt as well as his wife; the ceremonies were seen as a key factor in determining the outcome of the hunt. Social status didn&#x27;t just affect who was allowed to join the whaling hunt, it also affected the distribution of the whales’ meat and the blubber.

Perhaps the most famous Nuu-chah-nulth artifact in modern years is the Yuquot Whalers&#x27; Shrine, a ritual house-like structure used in the spiritual preparations for whale hunts. Composed of a series of memorial posts depicting spirit figures and the bones of whaling ancestors, it is stored at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, having been taken there by European Americans. It was the subject of the film &quot;The Washing of Tears&quot;, directed by Hugh Brody. It recounts the rediscovery of the bones and other artifacts at the museum and the efforts by the Mowachaht First Nation, the shrine&#x27;s original owners, who have been seeking to regain these sacred artifacts.

===Food===
While the Nuu-chah-nulth nations did rely on whaling as an important food and oil resource, the territories they lived had many other food sources.

The Nuu-chah-nulth peoples gathered food from marine environments including fish species such as halibut, herring, rockfish, and salmon which were caught along the coast while along the shoreline other sea inhabitant like clams, sea urchins, and mussels were harvested at low tide. Salmon streams were tended to ensure their continued strength and the fish were either cooked in large wooden vessels using water and hot stones or dried to be consumed during the winter.

Nuu-chah-nulth nations also gathered resources from the land as food sources. Some of these edible plants include camas root, rhizomes from ferns and many different variety of berries such as blueberry and huckleberry to name a few examples. Some of the Nuu-chah-nulth nations also tended the growth of camas root and Crabapple trees in order to maintain them as a source of food.

Within Nuu-chah-nulth nations individuals passed down their extensive knowledge of when and where to find these marine and land based foods through the generations from elders to youth. This is done both through comprehensive oral histories and through actively teaching children these important skills and having them participate in the collection of resources at a young age.

In an effort to revive traditional diets, the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council and sixteen tribes have contributed to recipes in a traditional wild food cookbook. The 90-page cookbook focuses on traditional recipes and seasonal ingredients from the west coast of Vancouver Island and Northern Washington. It explores First Nations cuisine and adds cooking tips, cultural observations, and oral history anecdotes. &quot;Čamus&quot; (chum-us) features traditional and wild ingredients.

&quot;Čamus&quot; explores the art of how to butterfly a salmon and how to can fish, also providing recipes for marinated seaweed, steam pit cooking, and Nuu-chah-nulth &quot;upskwee&quot;. &quot;Čamus&quot; illuminates a traditional way of eating while promoting a healthy lifestyle. The First Nations of Vancouver Island&#x27;s west coast and northern Washington link family and community in their respectful treatment of their territories&#x27; freshest ingredients.

===Cedar tree use===
Nuu-chah-nulth nations also used the wood and bark of red and yellow cedar trees as both a building material and to produce many different objects. Artists and wood workers within a nation would carve full logs into totem poles and ocean going canoes, and the bark would be torn into strips and softened in water until malleable enough to be woven into baskets, clothing, and ceremonial regalia.

===Social hierarchy===
Due to the abundance of resources throughout the territories of the Nuu-chah-nulth nations, social life became more structured and a visible hierarchy formed within the communities. These consisted of the commoner class, and the chiefs that controlled the region. While members of the commoner class had autonomy they still required the consent of the chief to fish, hunt, and forage within the communities’ territory.

While being in control of ceremonial and territorial rights, chiefs were also responsible for the redistribution of wealth within their communities. This redistribution of wealth was a key societal factor for the Nuu-chah-nulth nations. A chief&#x27;s status is realized and maintained by their ability to provide for the members of their nation. By dictating the use of resources, chiefs could maintain social structure, and ensure the continued viability and strength of those resources.

===Potlatch===

The Nuu-chah-nulth and other Pacific Northwest cultures are famous for their potlatch ceremonies, in which the host honours guests with generous gifts. The term &#x27;potlatch&#x27; is ultimately a word of Nuu-chah-nulth origin. The purpose of the potlatch is manifold: redistribution of wealth, maintenance and recognition of social status, cementing alliances, the celebration and solemnization of marriage, and commemoration of important events.

<doc id="276390" wikidata="Q412340" url="?curid=276390" title="Chloral hydrate">
<text>Chloral hydrate is a geminal diol with the formula . It was first used as a sedative and hypnotic in Germany in the 1870s. Over time it was replaced by safer and more effective alternatives but it remained in usage in the United States until at least the 1970s. It sometimes finds usage as a laboratory chemical reagent and precursor. It is derived from chloral (trichloroacetaldehyde) by the addition of one equivalent of water.

==Uses==
===Hypnotic===
Chloral hydrate has not been approved by the FDA in the United States nor the EMA in the European Union for any medical indication and is on the FDA list of unapproved drugs that are still prescribed by clinicians. Usage of the drug as a sedative or hypnotic may carry some risk given the lack of clinical trials. However, chloral hydrate products, licensed for short-term management of severe insomnia, are available in the United Kingdom. Chloral hydrate was voluntarily removed from the market by all manufacturers in the United States in 2012. Prior to that, chloral hydrate may have been sold as a &quot;legacy&quot; or &quot;grandfathered&quot; drug; that is, a drug that existed prior to the time certain FDA regulations took effect and therefore, some pharmaceutical companies have argued, has never required FDA approval. New drugs did not have to be approved for safety until Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &quot;FD&amp;C Act&quot;) in 1938. Further, a new drug did not have to be proven effective until 1962, when Congress amended the Act. Manufacturers contend that such &quot;legacy drugs&quot;, by virtue of the fact that they have been prescribed for decades, have gained a history of safety and efficacy.

Chloral hydrate was used for the short-term treatment of insomnia and as a sedative before minor medical or dental treatment. It was largely displaced in the mid-20th century by barbiturates and subsequently by benzodiazepines. It was also formerly used in veterinary medicine as a general anesthetic but is not considered acceptable for anesthesia or euthanasia of small animals due to adverse effects. It is also still used as a sedative prior to EEG procedures, as it is one of the few available sedatives that does not suppress epileptiform discharges.

In therapeutic doses for insomnia, chloral hydrate is effective within 20 to 60 minutes. In humans it is metabolized within 7 hours into trichloroethanol and trichloroethanol glucuronide by erythrocytes and plasma esterases and into trichloroacetic acid in 4 to 5 days. It has a very narrow therapeutic window making this drug difficult to use. Higher doses can depress respiration and blood pressure. Tolerance to the drug develops after a few days of use.

===In organic synthesis===
Chloral hydrate is a starting point for the synthesis of other organic compounds. It is the starting material for the production of chloral, which is produced by the distillation of a mixture of chloral hydrate and sulfuric acid, which serves as the desiccant.

Notably, it is used to synthesize isatin. In this synthesis, chloral hydrate reacts with aniline and hydroxylamine to give a condensation product which cyclicizes in sulfuric acid to give the target compound:

Moreover, chloral hydrate is used as a reagent for the deprotection of acetals, dithioacetals and tetrahydropyranyl ethers in organic solvents.

The compound can be crystallized in a variety of polymorphs.

===Botany and mycology===
====Hoyer&#x27;s mounting medium====
Chloral hydrate is also an ingredient used for Hoyer&#x27;s solution, a mounting medium for microscopic observation of diverse plant types such as bryophytes, ferns, seeds, and small arthropods (especially mites). Other ingredients may include gum arabic and glycerol. An advantage of this medium includes a high refractive index and clearing (macerating) properties of small specimens (especially advantageous if specimens require observation with differential interference contrast microscopy).

Because of its status as a regulated substance, chloral hydrate can be difficult to obtain. This has led to chloral hydrate being replaced by alternative reagents in microscopy procedures.

====Melzer&#x27;s reagent====
Chloral hydrate is an ingredient used to make Melzer&#x27;s reagent, an aqueous solution that is used to identify certain species of fungi. The other ingredients are potassium iodide, and iodine. Whether tissue or spores react to this reagent is vital for the correct identification of some mushrooms.

==Safety==
Chloral hydrate was routinely administered in gram quantities. Prolonged exposure to its vapors is unhealthy, with an LD50 for 4-hour exposure of 440 mg/m3. Long-term use of chloral hydrate is associated with a rapid development of tolerance to its effects and possible addiction as well as adverse effects including rashes, gastric discomfort and severe kidney, heart, and liver failure.

Acute overdosage is often characterized by nausea, vomiting, confusion, convulsions, slow and irregular breathing, cardiac arrhythmia, and coma. The plasma, serum or blood concentrations of chloral hydrate and/or trichloroethanol, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the forensic investigation of fatalities. Accidental overdosage of young children undergoing simple dental or surgical procedures has occurred. Hemodialysis has been used successfully to accelerate clearance of the drug in poisoning victims. It is listed as having a &quot;conditional risk&quot; of causing torsades de pointes.

==Production==
Chloral hydrate is produced from chlorine and ethanol in acidic solution. 

In basic conditions the haloform reaction takes place and chloral hydrate is decomposed by hydrolysis to form chloroform.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Chloral hydrate is metabolized &quot;in vivo&quot; to trichloroethanol, which is responsible for secondary physiological and psychological effects. The metabolite of chloral hydrate exerts its pharmacological properties via enhancing the GABA receptor complex and therefore is similar in action to benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines and barbiturates. It can be moderately addictive, as chronic use is known to cause dependency and withdrawal symptoms. The chemical can potentiate various anticoagulants and is weakly mutagenic &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;.

Chloral hydrate inhibits liver alcohol dehydrogenase &quot;in vitro&quot;. This could be an explanation of the synergeric effect seen with alcohol.

Chloral hydrate is structurally and somewhat pharmacodynamically similar to ethchlorvynol, a pharmaceutical developed during the 1950s that was marketed as both a sedative and a hypnotic under the trade name Placidyl. In 1999, Abbott, the sole manufacturer of the drug in the United States at the time, decided to discontinue the product. After Abbott ceased production, the drug remained available for about a year. Despite the fact that it could have been manufactured generically, no other company in the United States chose to do so.

===Pharmacokinetics ===
Chloral hydrate is metabolized to both 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) by alcohol dehydrogenase. TCE is further converted to its glucoronide. Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) has been detected as a metabolite in children, but how it gets made is unknown. TCE glucoronide, TCA, and a very small amount of free TCE are excreted in urine in male human adults. This study did not detect significant amounts of DCA; the authors noted that DCA can form during inappropriate sample preparation. Both TCA and DCA cause liver tumors in mice.

TCA is cleared by the kidneys at a rate slower than the expected filtration rate, suggesting that efficient reabsorption of filtered-out TCA happens.

==Legal status==
In the United States, chloral hydrate is a schedule IV controlled substance and requires a physician&#x27;s prescription. Its properties have sometimes led to its use as a date rape drug. The phrase, &quot;slipping a mickey,&quot; originally referred specifically to adding chloral hydrate to a person&#x27;s (alcoholic) drink without the person&#x27;s knowledge.

== History ==
Chloral hydrate was first synthesized by the chemist Justus von Liebig in 1832 at the University of Giessen. Liebig discovered the molecule when a chlorination (halogenation) reaction was performed on ethanol. Its sedative properties were observed by Rudolf Buchheim in 1861, but described in detail and published only in 1869 by Oscar Liebreich; subsequently, because of its easy synthesis, its use became widespread. Through experimentation, physiologist Claude Bernard clarified that the chloral hydrate was hypnotic as opposed to an analgesic. It was the first of a long line of sedatives, most notably the barbiturates, manufactured and marketed by the German pharmaceutical industry. Historically, chloral hydrate was utilized primarily as a psychiatric medication. In 1869, German physician and pharmacologist Oscar Liebreich began to promote its use to calm anxiety, especially when it caused insomnia. Chloral hydrate had certain advantages over morphine for this application, as it worked quickly without injection and had a consistent strength.

The compound achieved wide use in both asylums and the homes of those socially refined enough to avoid asylums. Upper- and middle-class women, well-represented in the latter category, were particularly susceptible to chloral hydrate addiction. After the 1904 invention of barbital, the first of the barbiturate family, chloral hydrate began to disappear from use among those with means. It remained common in asylums and hospitals until the Second World War as it was quite cheap. Chloral hydrate had some other important advantages that kept it in use for five decades despite the existence of more advanced barbiturates. It was the safest available sedative until the middle of the twentieth century, and thus was particularly favored for children. It also left patients much more refreshed after a deep sleep than more recently invented sedatives. Its frequency of use made it an early and regular feature in &quot;The Merck Manual&quot;.

Chloral hydrate was also a significant object of study in various early pharmacological experiments. In 1875, Claude Bernard tried to determine if chloral hydrate exerted its action through a metabolic conversion to chloroform. This was not only the first attempt to determine whether different drugs were converted to the same metabolite in the body but also the first to measure the concentration of a particular pharmaceutical in the blood. The results were inconclusive. In 1899 and 1901 Hans Horst Meyer and Ernest Overton respectively made the major discovery that the general anaesthetic action of a drug was strongly correlated to its lipid solubility. However, chloral hydrate was quite polar but nonetheless a potent hypnotic. Overton was unable to explain this mystery. Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard&#x27;s experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that it was converted into the more lipophilic molecule 2,2,2-trichloroethanol. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer–Overton correlation than chloral had. Prior to this, it had not been demonstrated that general anesthetics could undergo chemical changes to exert their action in the body.

Chloral hydrate was the first hypnotic to be used intravenously as a general anesthetic. In 1871, Pierre-Cyprien Oré began experiments on animals, followed by humans. While a state of general anesthesia could be achieved, the technique never caught on because its administration was more complex and less safe than the oral administration of chloral hydrate, and less safe for intravenous use than later general anesthetics were found to be.

==Society and culture==
Chloral hydrate was used as one of the earliest synthetic drugs to treat insomnia. In 1912, Bayer introduced the drug phenobarbital under the brand name Luminal. In the 1930s, pentobarbital and secobarbital (better known by their original brand names Nembutal and Seconal, respectively) were synthesized. Chloral hydrate was still prescribed, although its predominance as a sedative and a hypnotic was largely eclipsed by barbiturates.

Chloral hydrate is soluble in both water and ethanol, readily forming concentrated solutions. A solution of chloral hydrate in ethanol called &quot;knockout drops&quot; was used to prepare a Mickey Finn.

In 1897, Bram Stoker&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, one of its characters, Doctor John Seward, recorded his use and his molecular formula in his phonographic diary:

I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been. If I don&#x27;t sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus — ! I should be careful not to let it grow into a habit. No I shall take none to-night! I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not dishonor her by mixing the two.

In the conclusion of Edith Wharton&#x27;s 1905 novel &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;, Lily Bart, the novel&#x27;s heroine, becomes addicted to chloral hydrate and overdoses on the substance:
She put out her hand and measured the soothing drops into a glass; but as she did so, she knew they would be powerless against the supernatural lucidity of her brain. She had long since raised the dose to its highest limit, but to-night she felt she must increase it. She knew she took a slight risk in doing so; she remembered the chemist&#x27;s warning. If sleep came at all, it might be a sleep without waking.In the James Bond films &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, chloral hydrate is used as a knockout drug.

== Notable users ==

* King Chulalongkorn of Thailand (1853–1910) used the drug for a period after 1893 to relieve what may have been a mix of depression and unspecified illnesses. He was reported by his doctor to have been taking one bottle per day during July 1894 although this was reduced after this time.
* Montgomery Clift (1920–1966), American actor.
* André Gide (1869–1951) was given chloral hydrate as a boy for sleep problems by a physician named Lizart. Gide states in his autobiography &quot;If It Die...&quot; that &quot;all my later weaknesses of will or memory I attribute to him.&quot;
* William James (1842–1910), psychologist and philosopher, used the drug for insomnia and sedation due to chronic neurosis.
* The Jonestown mass murder-suicides in 1978 involved the communal drinking of Flavor Aid poisoned with diazepam, chloral hydrate, cyanide, and promethazine.
* Mary Todd Lincoln (1818–1882), wife of American president Abraham Lincoln, became addicted in the years after her husband&#x27;s death and was committed to an asylum.
* Marilyn Monroe (1926–1962) died from an overdose of chloral hydrate and pentobarbital (Nembutal).
* Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) regularly used chloral hydrate in the years leading up to his nervous breakdown, according to Lou Salomé and other associates. Whether the drug contributed to his insanity is a point of controversy.
* Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882) became addicted to chloral, with whisky chasers, after the death of his wife Elizabeth Siddal from a laudanum overdose in 1862. He had a mental breakdown in 1872. He lived out the last ten years of his life addicted to chloral and alcohol, in part to mask the pain of botched surgery to an enlarged testicle in 1877.
* Oliver Sacks (1933–2015) abused chloral hydrate in 1965 as a depressed insomniac. He found himself taking fifteen times the usual dose of chloral hydrate every night before he eventually ran out, causing violent withdrawal symptoms.
* Anna Nicole Smith (1967–2007) died of &quot;combined drug intoxication&quot; with chloral hydrate as the &quot;major component&quot;.
* John Tyndall (1820–1893), an Irish physicist, died of an accidental overdose of chloral administered by his wife.
* Evelyn Waugh (1903–1966), insomniac for much of his adult life, for which &quot;in later life ... he became so deleteriously dependent on chloral&quot;. Waugh&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold&quot;, is largely a fictionalised account of an episode Waugh himself experienced as a result of excessive use of chloral in combination with bromide and alcohol. Waugh&#x27;s friend and biographer Christopher Sykes observed that Waugh&#x27;s description of D. G. Rossetti&#x27;s demise under the effects of excessive use of chloral in his 1928 biography of the artist &quot;is a fairly exact description of how [Waugh&#x27;s own] life ended in 1966&quot;.
* Hank Williams (1923–1953) died from a combination of chloral hydrate, morphine and whiskey.
* Renée Vivien (1877-1909), a prominent lesbian poet during the Belle Époque, abused chloral hydrate for much of her life.

==Environmental==
It is, together with chloroform, a minor side-product of the chlorination of water when organic residues such as humic acids are present. It has been detected in drinking water at concentrations of up to 100 micrograms per litre (μg/L) but concentrations are normally found to be below 10 μg/L. Levels are generally found to be higher in surface water than in ground water.

<text>Portia Lee James DeGeneres (born Amanda Lee Rogers; 31 January 1973), known professionally as Portia de Rossi, is an Australian-American retired actress. She played Nelle Porter on the American drama series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1998–2002), for which she won a Screen Actors Guild Award; Lindsay Bluth Fünke on the American television sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2006, 2013, 2018–2019), and Elizabeth North on the American political thriller series &quot;Scandal&quot; (2014–2017). She is the founder and CEO of the art company The General Public.

She also portrayed high-end escort Olivia Lord on the American television drama series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2007–2009) and wise-cracking Office Manager Veronica Palmer on the American television sitcom &quot;Better Off Ted&quot; (2009–2010). De Rossi is married to comedian, actress, and television host Ellen DeGeneres.

== Early life ==
Portia de Rossi was born Amanda Lee Rogers in Horsham, Victoria, Australia, the daughter of Margaret, a medical receptionist, and Barry Rogers. Her father died when she was nine years old. She grew up in Grovedale, a suburb of Geelong, Victoria, and modelled for print and some TV commercials as a child. In 1988, at age 15, she adopted the name Portia de Rossi. In 2005, she said that she had done so to reinvent herself and sound more mature, using the given name of Portia, a character from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice,&quot; and an Italian last name. She was educated at Geelong Grammar School, Melbourne Girls Grammar and the University of Melbourne, where she studied law.

== Career ==

De Rossi&#x27;s first significant role was as a young and impressionable maid in the Australian 1994 film &quot;Sirens.&quot; Soon afterward, she moved to Los Angeles and won guest roles on several TV shows and a permanent role in &quot;Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher,&quot; before landing a part in the film &quot;Scream 2.&quot; During her time in the United States, de Rossi worked to drop her Australian accent.

De Rossi garnered international attention when she joined the main cast of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; in 1998, playing lawyer Nelle Porter. She remained with the show until its end in 2002. In 2001, she starred in &quot;Who Is Cletis Tout?&quot; alongside Christian Slater. From 2003 to 2006, de Rossi starred as Lindsay Bluth Fünke on Fox Television&#x27;s &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. She next portrayed John F. Kennedy, Jr.&#x27;s wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, in the made-for-TV movie &quot;America&#x27;s Prince: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story&quot; in 2003. That same year, she portrayed an Australian reporter who inspires a protest against Frank Sinatra during a concert tour in &quot;The Night We Called It a Day.&quot;

In 2005 de Rossi portrayed Zela, a fortune-teller, in the Wes Craven thriller &quot;Cursed.&quot; From 2007 to 2008, de Rossi appeared in &quot;Nip/Tuck&#x27;s&quot; fifth season as Julia McNamara&#x27;s girlfriend, Olivia Lord.

In 2009 and 2010, de Rossi played the high-strung and controlling Veronica Palmer on the ABC show &quot;Better Off Ted&quot;. In 2011, she appeared in &quot;Better Off Ted&quot; cast member Malcolm Barrett&#x27;s music video for &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;, spoofing her character in a cameo alongside other cast members of the series.

She ranked 69th in &quot;Stuff Magazine&#x27;s&quot; 100 Sexiest Women, 31 in &quot;Femme Fatales&quot;&#x27; Sexiest Women of 2003 list, and 24 in &quot;Maxim&#x27;s&quot; 100 Sexiest Women List in 2004; in late 2006, the magazine &quot;Blender&quot; listed her as one of the hottest women of film and TV. In May 2007, she was featured as one of 100 Most Beautiful in a &quot;People&quot; special edition. &quot;TV Guide&quot; included her and Ellen DeGeneres in their Power A-List couples in 2007.

In February 2012, it was announced that ABC had ordered a pilot for a new drama series &quot;The Smart One&quot;, one of whose executive producers was Ellen DeGeneres, and which featured de Rossi in a leading role. The actress was to star as a &quot;brilliant and successful woman who begrudgingly goes to work for her less-brainy but more popular sister – a former beauty queen, weather girl and now big-city Mayor.&quot; But &quot;The Smart One&quot; was not picked up for the 2012–2013 season.

Six years after the series was canceled by Fox, filming for a revived fourth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; began in August 2012, and de Rossi reprised her role as Lindsay Bluth Fünke. This fourth season consisted of 15 new episodes, which debuted on Netflix on 26 May 2013. Each episode focused on one particular character, with de Rossi&#x27;s Lindsay featured in episode 3, &quot;Indian Takers&quot;, and Episode 8, &quot;Red Hairing&quot;, and also appearing in several other episodes of the season.

In July 2014, ABC confirmed that de Rossi was joining season 4 of &quot;Scandal&quot;, in the role of Elizabeth North. Her recurring role was upgraded to a series regular for the fifth season. In April 2017, in season six, de Rossi&#x27;s character was killed off in a golf club attack. De Rossi herself made the decision to depart the series.

In May 2018, de Rossi announced on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that she would be retiring from acting, though she later elaborated that she would make an exception for future seasons of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.

== Personal life ==

De Rossi was married to documentary filmmaker Mel Metcalfe from 1996 to 1999, initially part of a plan to get a green card, though she did not go through with the plan. She said about the marriage that &quot;it just obviously wasn&#x27;t right for me.&quot; In a 2010 interview on &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; she said that as a young actress, she was fearful of being exposed as a lesbian.

From 2000 to 2004, de Rossi dated director Francesca Gregorini, the daughter of Barbara Bach and the stepdaughter of Ringo Starr. She said that most of her family and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; castmates did not know she was a lesbian until tabloid pictures of the couple were published. She declined to publicly discuss the relationship or her sexual orientation at the time.

De Rossi and Gregorini broke up in late 2004 because de Rossi began dating DeGeneres, whom she met backstage at an awards show. In 2005, she opened up publicly about her sexual orientation in interviews with &quot;Details&quot; and &quot;The Advocate.&quot; She and DeGeneres became engaged when DeGeneres proposed in 2008. They were married at their Beverly Hills home on 16 August 2008, witnessed by their mothers and 19 other guests. On 6 August 2010, de Rossi filed a petition to legally change her name to Portia Lee James DeGeneres. The petition was granted on 23 September 2010. She became a United States citizen in September 2011.

In 2010, de Rossi published her autobiography, titled &quot;Unbearable Lightness: A Story of Loss and Gain,&quot; within which she wrote about the trauma and turmoil that she had experienced in her life, including suffering from anorexia nervosa and bulimia and being misdiagnosed with lupus. She had struggled with the eating disorders for five years while filming &quot;Ally McBeal.&quot; To promote the book, she appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show.&quot;

DeGeneres and de Rossi both became vegans in 2008, though DeGeneres said in December 2018 that she is no longer vegan and no longer associates with the vegan lifestyle. The couple have adopted several rescue animals.

In 2017, de Rossi tweeted that actor Steven Seagal had exposed himself to her while she was auditioning for one of his films.

== Philanthropy ==
De Rossi supports a variety of charitable organizations, including Locks of Love, a group that provides high-quality human hair wigs for children and teens with alopecia and other medical conditions that cause hair loss.

She has also supported fundraising efforts for FXB International, an African AIDS relief organization, and The Art of Elysium, an art foundation for terminally ill children. De Rossi also supports Alley Cat Allies, an organization dedicated to protecting and improving the lives of alley cats. De Rossi and DeGeneres are major supporters of The Gentle Barn, a California sanctuary for physically abused animals.

<doc id="276395" wikidata="Q230180" url="?curid=276395" title="Courtney Thorne-Smith">
<text>Courtney Thorne-Smith (born 1966 or 1967) is an American actress. She is known for her starring roles as Alison Parker on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, Georgia Thomas on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, and Cheryl Mabel on &quot;According to Jim&quot;, as well as her recurring role on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; as Lyndsey McElroy.

==Early life, family and education==
Thorne-Smith grew up in Menlo Park, California, a suburb south of San Francisco. Her father, Walter Smith, was a computer market researcher, and her mother, Lora Thorne, was a therapist. They divorced when Courtney was seven years old, and she lived with both parents at different stages. She has an older sister, Jennifer, who is an advertising executive. 

Courtney attended Menlo-Atherton High School, in Atherton, California, but she graduated from Tamalpais High School, in Mill Valley, California, in 1985. She performed with the Ensemble Theater Company in Mill Valley while attending high school.

==Career==
===Films===
Thorne-Smith made her first film appearance in the 1986 feature film drama &quot;Lucas&quot;, alongside Winona Ryder, Corey Haim, and Charlie Sheen. She was also involved in a number of movies in the late 1980s, such as &quot;Welcome to 18&quot; (1986), &quot;Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise&quot; (1987), &quot;Summer School&quot; (1987), and &quot;Side Out&quot; (1990). In 1998, she starred in the box office flop &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot; with Carrot Top. In 2009, she appeared in &quot;Sorority Wars&quot;. 

===Television===
She appeared on a few mid-1980s television series such as &quot;Growing Pains&quot; and the short-lived &quot;Fast Times&quot;, as well as made-for-television movies including &quot;The Thanksgiving Promise&quot; and &quot;Infidelity&quot; before landing a regular role in the 1988-1989 sitcom &quot;Day by Day&quot; with Douglas Sheehan, Linda Kelsey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. In 1990, she was featured in six episodes of &quot;L.A. Law&quot; as Laker Girl Kimberly Dugan.

Her first notable starring television role was as Alison Parker on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; from 1992 to 1997. During this time, in 1995, she starred in a made-for-television movie &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Revenge&quot; which was also marketed in CD and DVD form as &quot;Midwest Obsession&quot;. Following this, she went on to play Georgia Thomas on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; from 1997 to 2000. Thorne-Smith originally auditioned for the title role in the show, which ultimately went to Calista Flockhart. Her character was written out of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; at the beginning of season four in 2000, though she returned for occasional guest appearances afterwards. She later said that she left the show in part because of the pressure to stay thin. &quot;I started undereating, overexercising, pushing myself too hard and brutalizing my immune system,&quot; she told &quot;US Weekly&quot;. &quot;The amount of time I spent thinking about food and being upset about my body was insane.&quot;

From 2001 to 2009, she starred as Cheryl on &quot;According to Jim&quot;. In 2007, her real-life pregnancy was hidden on the show at first, but was then written into the plot. On February 18, 2010, she signed on to play Alan Harper (Jon Cryer)&#x27;s girlfriend, Lyndsey McElroy, in season seven of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. She appeared in 52 episodes from season seven through twelve.

Starting in 2017, Thorne-Smith has starred in a series of television films, the &quot;Emma Fielding Mysteries&quot; based on the novels by Dana Cameron. Three entries have been telecast on the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries channel as of 2019.

===Writing===
On September 18, 2007, Thorne-Smith&#x27;s novel, &quot;Outside In&quot;, was published by Broadway Books in New York.

===Other ventures===
In 1997, she became a spokesperson for cosmetics brand Almay, being the face of their new &quot;Skin Stays Clean&quot; line of make-up. She appeared for Almay&#x27;s print ads and television commercials until 2001. In 2003, Thorne-Smith appeared on Kellogg&#x27;s Special K cereal boxes as part of a breast cancer awareness campaign with Kelloggs and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. 

During her career, she has graced the cover of numerous magazines such as &quot;Shape&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Self&quot;, &quot;InStyle Weddings&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;TV Guide, Vogue Knitting&quot; and &quot;Fit Pregnancy&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Thorne-Smith dated her &quot;Melrose Place&quot; co-star Andrew Shue.

In June 2000, she married geneticist Andrew Conrad; the couple divorced in January 2001.

On January 1, 2007, she married Roger Fishman. On January 11, 2008, she gave birth to their son.

<text>The Sand Reckoner (, &quot;Psammites&quot;) is a work by Archimedes, an Ancient Greek mathematician of the 3rd century BC, in which he set out to determine an upper bound for the number of grains of sand that fit into the universe. In order to do this, Archimedes had to estimate the size of the universe according to the contemporary model, and invent a way to talk about extremely large numbers. 

The work, also known in Latin as &quot;Arenarius&quot;, is about eight pages long in translation and is addressed to the Syracusan king Gelo II (son of Hiero II). It is considered the most accessible work of Archimedes.

==Naming large numbers==
First, Archimedes had to invent a system of naming large numbers. The number system in use at that time could express numbers up to a myriad (μυριάς — 10,000), and by utilizing the word &quot;myriad&quot; itself, one can immediately extend this to naming all numbers up to a myriad myriads (108). Archimedes called the numbers up to 108 &quot;first order&quot; and called 108 itself the &quot;unit of the second order&quot;. Multiples of this unit then became the second order, up to this unit taken a myriad-myriad times, 108·108=1016. This became the &quot;unit of the third order&quot;, whose multiples were the third order, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad-myriad times the unit of the 108-th order, i.e., (108)^(108)

After having done this, Archimedes called the orders he had defined the &quot;orders of the first period&quot;, and called the last one, formula_1, the &quot;unit of the second period&quot;. He then constructed the orders of the second period by taking multiples of this unit in a way analogous to the way in which the orders of the first period were constructed. Continuing in this manner, he eventually arrived at the orders of the myriad-myriadth period. The largest number named by Archimedes was the last number in this period, which is
::formula_2
Another way of describing this number is a one followed by (short scale) eighty quadrillion (80·1015) zeroes.

Archimedes&#x27; system is reminiscent of a positional numeral system with base 108, which is remarkable because the ancient Greeks used a very simple system for writing numbers, which employs 27 different letters of the alphabet for the units 1 through 9, the tens 10 through 90 and the hundreds 100 through 900.

=== Law of exponents ===
Archimedes also discovered and proved the law of exponents, formula_3, necessary to manipulate powers of 10.

==Estimation of the size of the universe==
Archimedes then estimated an upper bound for the number of grains of sand required to fill the Universe. To do this, he used the heliocentric model of Aristarchus of Samos. The original work by Aristarchus has been lost. This work by Archimedes however is one of the few surviving references to his theory, whereby the Sun remains unmoved while the Earth orbits the Sun. In Archimedes&#x27;s own words:

The reason for the large size of this model is that the Greeks were unable to observe stellar parallax with available techniques, which implies that any parallax is extremely small and so the stars must be placed at great distances from the Earth (assuming heliocentrism to be true).

According to Archimedes, Aristarchus did not state how far the stars were from the Earth. Archimedes therefore had to make the following assumptions:
* The Universe was spherical
* The ratio of the diameter of the Universe to the diameter of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun equalled the ratio of the diameter of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun to the diameter of the Earth.
This assumption can also be expressed by saying that the stellar parallax caused by the motion of the Earth around its orbit equals the solar parallax caused by motion around the Earth. Put in a ratio:

formula_4

In order to obtain an upper bound, Archimedes made the following assumptions of their dimensions:
* that the perimeter of the Earth was no bigger than 300 myriad stadia (5.55·105 km).
* that the Moon was no larger than the Earth, and that the Sun was no more than thirty times larger than the Moon.
* that the angular diameter of the Sun, as seen from the Earth, was greater than 1/200 of a right angle (π/400 radians = 0.45° degrees).
Archimedes then concluded that the diameter of the Universe was no more than 1014 stadia (in modern units, about 2 light years), and that it would require no more than 1063 grains of sand to fill it. With these measurements, each grain of sand in Archimedes&#x27;s thought-experiment would have been approximately 19 μm (0.019 mm) in diameter.

===Calculation of the number of grains of sand in the Aristarchian Universe===

Archimedes claims that forty poppy-seeds laid side by side would equal one Greek dactyl (finger-width) which was approximately 19 mm (3/4 inch) in length. Since volume proceeds as the cube of a linear dimension (&quot;For it has been proved that spheres have the triplicate ratio to one another of their diameters&quot;) then a sphere one dactyl in diameter would contain (using our current number system) 403, or 64,000 poppy seeds.

He then claimed (without evidence) that each poppy seed could contain a myriad (10,000) grains of sand. Multiplying the two figures together he proposed 640,000,000 as the number of hypothetical grains of sand in a sphere one dactyl in diameter.

To make further calculations easier, he rounded up 640 million to one billion, noting only that the first number is smaller than the second, and that therefore the number of grains of sand calculated subsequently will exceed the actual number of grains. Recall that Archimedes&#x27;s meta-goal with this essay was to show how to calculate with what were previously considered impossibly large numbers, not simply to accurately calculate the number of grains of sand that would fit in the universe.

A Greek stadium had a length of 600 Greek feet, and each foot was 16 dactyls long, so there were 9,600 dactyls in a stadium. Archimedes rounded this number up to 10,000 (a myriad) to make calculations easier, again, noting that the resulting number will exceed the actual number of grains of sand.

The cube of 10,000 is a trillion (1012); and multiplying a billion (the number of grains of sand in a dactyl-sphere) by a trillion (number of dactyl-spheres in a stadium-sphere) yields 1021, the number of grains of sand in a stadium-sphere.

Archimedes had estimated that the Aristarchian Universe was 1014 stadia in diameter, so there would accordingly be (1014)3 stadium-spheres in the universe, or 1042. Multiplying 1021 by 1042 yields 1063, the number of grains of sand in the Aristarchian Universe.

Following Archimedes&#x27;s estimate of a myriad (10,000) grains of sand in a poppy seed; 64,000 poppy seeds in a dactyl-sphere; the length of a stadium as 10,000 dactyls; and accepting 19mm as the width of a dactyl, the diameter of Archimedes&#x27;s typical sand grain would be 18.3 μm, which today we would call a grain of silt. Currently, the smallest grain of sand would be defined as 50 μm in diameter.

===Additional calculations===
Archimedes made some interesting experiments and computations along the way. One experiment was to estimate the angular size of the Sun, as seen from the Earth. Archimedes&#x27;s method is especially interesting as it takes into account the finite size of the eye&#x27;s pupil, and therefore may be the first known example of experimentation in psychophysics, the branch of psychology dealing with the mechanics of human perception, whose development is generally attributed to Hermann von Helmholtz. Another interesting computation accounts for solar parallax and the different distances between the viewer and the Sun, whether viewed from the center of the Earth or from the surface of the Earth at sunrise. This may be the first known computation dealing with solar parallax.

<text>Bridesmaids are members of the bride&#x27;s party at some Western traditional wedding ceremonies. A bridesmaid is typically a young woman and often the bride&#x27;s close friend or relative. She attends to the bride on the day of a wedding or marriage ceremony. Traditionally, bridesmaids were chosen from unwed young women of marriageable age.

The principal bridesmaid, if one is designated, may be called the chief bridesmaid. She may also be called the maid of honor if she is unmarried, or the matron of honor if she is married. A junior bridesmaid is a girl who is clearly too young to be married but who is included as a bridesmaid anyway. In the United States, typically only the maid or matron of honor and the best man are considered official witnesses for the wedding license.

Often there is more than one bridesmaid; in modern times the bride chooses how many to ask. Historically, no person of status went out unattended, and the size of the retinue was closely calculated to be appropriate to the family&#x27;s social status. A large group of bridesmaids provided an opportunity for showing off the family&#x27;s social status and wealth. Today, the number of bridesmaids in a wedding party is dependent on many variables, including a bride&#x27;s preferences, the size of her family, and the number of attendants her partner would like to have as well. Many modern couples do not have bridesmaids or groomsmen, which eliminates all the associated expenses and logistical effort.

== Related roles ==
The male equivalent is the groomsman, also known in British English as an &quot;usher.&quot; In the United States, the role of attending to the groom has diverged from that of escorting guests to their seats, and the two positions are no longer synonymous and are often, if not usually, filled by different persons.

In some cultures, such as in Norway, the Netherlands, France and Victorian Britain, it is (or has been) customary for bridesmaids to be small girls rather than grown women. They may carry flowers during the wedding procession and pose with the married couple in bridal photos. In modern English-speaking countries, this role is separate from that of the bridesmaid, and the small child performing it is known as a flower girl.

==Duties==

Although many exceed the minimum, the bridesmaids&#x27; required duties are very limited. They are required to attend the wedding ceremony and to assist the bride on the day of the wedding. Bridesmaids in Europe and North America are often asked to assist the bride with planning the wedding and a wedding reception. In modern times, a bridesmaid often participates in planning wedding-related events, such as a bridal shower or bachelorette party, if there are any. These, however, are optional activities; according to etiquette expert Judith Martin, &quot;Contrary to rumor, bridesmaids are not obliged to entertain in honor of the bride, nor to wear dresses they cannot afford.&quot; If it is customary in the bride&#x27;s area to have a bridesmaids luncheon, then it is hosted, and therefore organized and paid for, by the bride. 
The duties and costs of being a bridesmaid are parsed out between a bride and her attendants in a variety of ways. Since modern bridesmaids, unlike their historical counterparts, can no longer rely on having their clothes and travel expenses paid for by the bride&#x27;s family, it has become customary for the bride to present the bridesmaids with gifts as a sign of gratitude for the support and financial commitment that comes with their roles. It has become equally customary for women who are invited to serve as bridesmaids to first ask about the amount of time, energy, and money that the bride expects from them before accepting this position, and to decline or resign if this is more than they will be able to give. In some American weddings, each bridesmaid may be asked to spend US$1,700 or more, with travel to destination weddings and pre-wedding parties usually being the biggest expense.

== Maid of honor ==
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;maid of honour&quot; originally referred to the female attendant of a queen. The term &#x27;bridesmaid&#x27; is normally used for all bridal attendants in the UK. However, when the attendant is married, or is a mature woman, the term &#x27;matron of honour&#x27; is often used. The influence of American English has led to the chief bridesmaid sometimes being called the maid of honour.

In North America, a wedding party might include several bridesmaids, but the &#x27;maid of honor&#x27; is the title and position held by the bride&#x27;s chief attendant, typically her closest friend or sister. In modern-day weddings, some brides opt to choose a long-time male friend or brother as their head attendant, using the title &#x27;best man&#x27; or &#x27;man of honor&#x27;.

The activities of the principal bridesmaid may be as many or as varied as she allows the bride to impose upon her. Her only required duty is to participate in the wedding ceremony. Typically, however, she is asked for help with the logistics of the wedding as an event, such as addressing invitations, and for her help as a friend, such as attending the bride as she shops for her wedding dress.

Aside from being the bride&#x27;s right hand, the maid of honor is responsible for leading the rest of the bridal party through the planning of any pre-wedding events. For example, the principal bridesmaid will be the one to make the arrangements for the bridal shower, including invitations, decorations, food, and any games or activities that will be played. He or she will also be in charge of planning the bachelorette party, including any travel or lodging accommodations that must be arranged.

On the day of the wedding, her principal duty is to provide practical and emotional support. She might assist the bride with dressing and, if needed, help the bride manage her veil, a bouquet, a prayer book, or the train of her wedding dress during the day. In a double-ring wedding, the chief bridesmaid is often entrusted with the groom&#x27;s wedding ring until it is needed during the ceremony. Many brides ask bridesmaids if they are adults, to be legal witnesses who sign the marriage license after the ceremony. If there is a reception after the wedding, the maid of honor may be asked to offer a toast to the newlywed.

==Origin and history==
The origin of the Western bridesmaid tradition likely arose from a combination of many factors. The most-likely factors include, but are not limited to, socioeconomic class and status, family size, socialization standards of the day, and religion.

Others cite the Biblical story of Jacob, and his two wives Leah and Rachel, who both literally came with their own maids as detailed in the Book of Genesis (29:24, 46:18) as the origin of bridesmaids. These women were handmaidens (servants or slaves) instead of social peers.

In ancient times, originally the bride and all the bridesmaids wore exactly the same dress and veiled their faces heavily, for the purpose of confusing jealous suitors and evil spirits.

In China during the feudal era, brides were susceptible to kidnapping at weddings by rival clans and hooligans. Shouldering the responsibility to protect the bride, bridesmaids were dressed up like the bride to lower the risk that she might be identified and taken. As legal protections for marriage were established, this was no longer necessary, and the role of bridesmaid took a more symbolic turn.

In the Victorian era, white was the official color for both male groomsmen and female bridesmaids. This trend originated with Queen Victoria when she married Prince Albert wearing a long white wedding dress, and her bridesmaids matched the color of her gown.

<text>The avian genus Quiscalus contains seven of the 11 species of grackles, gregarious passerine birds in the icterid family. They are native to North and South America.

The genus was named and described by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The type species was subsequently designated as the common grackle (&quot;Quiscalus quiscula&quot;) by English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840. The genus name comes from the specific name &quot;Gracula quiscula&quot; coined by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus for the common grackle. From where Linnaeus obtained the word is uncertain, but it may come from the Taíno word &quot;quisqueya&quot;, meaning &quot;mother of all lands&quot;, for the island of Hispaniola.

The genus contains six extant species and one extinct species:

In 2017, she won the International Emmy for Best Actress for her portrayal of the title character in the ITV/Netflix mystery drama series &quot;Marcella&quot; (2016–2021). Her other accolades include a Drama Desk Award, an honorary degree, and a BAFTA nomination.

Friel made her feature film debut in 1998 with a leading role in &quot;The Land Girls&quot;. Subsequent credits include &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1999), &quot;Me Without You&quot; (2001), &quot;Timeline&quot; (2003), &quot;Goal!&quot; (2005), &quot;Bathory&quot; (2008), &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; (2009), &quot;Limitless&quot; (2011), &quot;Books of Blood&quot; (2020), and &quot;Charming the Hearts of Men&quot; (2021). Her stage credits include &quot;Closer&quot; (Broadway, 1999), &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (West End, 2009), and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (West End, 2012).

==Early life==
Anna Louise Friel was born on 12 July 1976 in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Her mother, Julie Bamford Friel (born 1952), is a special needs teacher. Her father, Desmond &quot;Des&quot; Friel (born 1951), was born in Belfast and raised in County Donegal, Ireland. He is a former French teacher and folk guitarist, who now owns a web design company. Her brother Michael is a doctor, who in his youth did television advertising work for Hovis.

Friel attended Crompton House CE Secondary School—an Anglican school—and later Holy Cross College, a Roman Catholic sixth form. She began her training as an actress at Oldham Theatre Workshop.

==Career==
===1991–1999: Television work and film debut===
Friel made her professional debut at age 13 in the television miniseries &quot;G.B.H.&quot;, which aired in 1991 and was nominated for several BAFTAs. This led to small parts on the ITV soap operas &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (1991; 1992). She was cast the following year as Beth Jordache in the Channel 4 soap &quot;Brookside&quot;, a role she played for two years. The character was involved in some of the series&#x27; most famous storylines, including the murder and covert burial of her abusive father, and the first ever pre-watershed lesbian kiss in British television history; a moment that went on to be broadcast around the world—including 76 countries where homosexuality is outlawed—when it featured during a montage at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony. She later said, &quot;For a very long time I was defined by that kiss. And I didn&#x27;t want to be. I spent years turning down other lesbian roles because it felt like going back to Beth. [But it] did also make me want to take on parts that showed extreme sides of women&quot;. In 1995, Friel won a National Television Award in the category of &quot;Most Popular Actress&quot; for her work on &quot;Brookside&quot;.

Upon leaving the show, a decision that she initially thought to be a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;, Friel was cast in an episode of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and appeared as one of the main characters in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s television film &quot;The Tribe&quot; (1998), which attracted controversy for its inclusion of a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; sex scene. She then played leading roles in small-screen adaptations of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; and Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;St. Ives&quot; (both 1998), and co-starred in several British films, such as wartime period drama &quot;The Land Girls&quot; (1998), crime drama &quot;Rogue Trader&quot; (1999), and slapstick comedy &quot;Mad Cows&quot; (1999). While most were dismissive of &quot;Cow&quot;″s eccentric humour, some critics felt that Friel&#x27;s work as Australian expatriate Maddy was impressive. Next, she played Hermia in the 1999 film version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, saying later of the experience, &quot;I think that [role] sort of changed things for me, especially in America, because the cast was really great—Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christian Bale—and people started to think, &#x27;if she&#x27;s working with [those people] she must be doing well&#x27;&quot;.

During that same period, Friel made her Broadway debut in a production of Patrick Marber&#x27;s &quot;Closer&quot;, which ran for 173 performances at the Music Box Theatre in New York (March–August 1999). In his review of the show for &quot;Variety&quot;, Charles Isherwood wrote:

For her work as exotic dancer Alice, Friel won that year&#x27;s Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play.

===2000–2009: Stage roles, film work, and &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;===
Friel had leading roles in the comedy-drama films &quot;An Everlasting Piece&quot; and &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; (both 2000), with her performance in &quot;Piece&quot; attracting particular praise. The following year, she starred as the wife of a World War II soldier in the decently reviewed Canadian film &quot;The War Bride&quot;, for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Actress, and co-headlined the coming-of-age drama &quot;Me Without You&quot; opposite Michelle Williams. In his appraisal of &quot;You&quot; for &quot;Variety&quot;, David Rooney said, &quot;Of the central duo, Friel has the most difficult job, playing an essentially unsympathetic brat … But [she] continually tempers the negatives with a vulnerability and insecurity that redeem her&quot;. Between March and May 2001, Friel appeared in an adaptation of Frank Wedekind&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; at the Almeida Theatre; her West End stage debut. Describing her portrayal of the titular Victorian sex worker, theatre critic Nicholas de Jongh felt, &quot;The appeal of Miss Friel&#x27;s [performance] depends upon its restraint, guile and cool&quot;, noting that she mixes &quot;child-like glee and naughtiness&quot; with a &quot;calm and callous&quot; demeanour. The play transferred to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. for one month following its run at the Almeida.

Friel&#x27;s next roles were in the Irish television film &quot;Watermelon&quot; (2003), where she starred as a headstrong Dublin girl who travels to England for an abortion, and the Richard Donner fantasy adventure film &quot;Timeline&quot; (2003), where she played the love interest of the main character. She was then cast as Attorney Megan Delaney in &quot;The Jury&quot;, an American legal drama series that ran on Fox for a single season in 2004. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Alessandra Stanley called the show &quot;clever, innovative&quot;, and said of Friel, &quot;hers is the most textured and persuasive character&quot;. Friel later admitted to finding the job a challenge: &quot;Everyone was saying, &#x27;you will never believe how much hard work it is&#x27;, and I was telling them not to worry because I&#x27;m used to it … but my God were they right … You run off the set from one scene and get changed and run back on. It is so fast and so very well organised but it is hard, hard bloody work&quot;. Next, she played Geordie nurse Roz in the British-American sports drama &quot;Goal!&quot; (2005; a part she reprised in its sequel) and appeared as a recovering drug addict in the Toronto-set &quot;Niagara Motel&quot; (2006). In a mixed review of &quot;Motel&quot;, &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;″s Ken Eisner noted that Friel&#x27;s performance carried &quot;the most weight&quot; in the film, while commending her &quot;perfect local accent&quot;. In November 2006, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bolton for contributions to the performing arts.

In 2007, Friel was cast as Charlotte &quot;Chuck&quot; Charles in &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;, an American dramedy series created by Bryan Fuller, which aired on ABC from October that year until June 2009. The show was warmly reviewed during its run, with television critic John Leonard believing it to be &quot;at once satire, mystery, fairy tale, romance, lollipop, whimsy, and kazoo&quot;, and singling out Friel as a highlight. Her portrayal of Charles, a resurrected murder victim and passionate beekeeper, won her a nomination for the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. &quot;Daisies&quot; was cancelled shortly after its second season finale, with viewership having dropped from 13 million to 4.9 million. Friel was subsequently offered a number of roles on American television, but turned them down to focus on her film career.

For her portrayal of the title character in &quot;Bathory&quot;, a 2008 historical drama directed by Juraj Jakubisko, Friel was nominated for that year&#x27;s Czech Lion Award for Best Actress. With a budget of UK£9.5 million, the film was the most expensive ever made in central Europe and broke box-office records in Slovakia. In her review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Gwladys Fouché described the film as being &quot;bathed in a gothic atmosphere that tops every &quot;Dracula&quot; movie you&#x27;ve seen&quot;, while saying of Friel, &quot;[she] spends two-and-half hours wielding swords, torturing peasants, surviving poison plots and making love to Caravaggio (yes, the Italian painter) to protect her land&quot;, adding that &quot;[she] rolls her r&#x27;s in an interesting attempt at a local accent&quot;. Her next project was the science fiction adventure film &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;—her first lead role in a major U.S. production—where she co-starred opposite Will Ferrell. Directed by Brad Silberling and based on the 1970s television series of the same name, &quot;Lost&quot; was met with tepid reviews and poor box office upon its release in June 2009, though some critics enjoyed Friel&#x27;s portrayal of Holly Cantrell, a spirited palaeontologist, remarking that she and Ferrell shared onscreen chemistry.

Friel returned to the stage towards the end of 2009 in an adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, which played at the Theatre Royal Haymarket for four months and gained notice for its addition of nudity, with increased security being implemented at the venue after naked images of Friel—taken during a preview performance—were anonymously posted online. The production received mixed reviews, but Friel&#x27;s portrayal of café society daydreamer Holly Golightly, one of her &quot;all time favourite heroines&quot;, was praised: Alice Jones of &quot;The Independent&quot; described her as &quot;infectious&quot;, adding, &quot;Gorgeously gamine and wrapped, like a treat from Tiffany&#x27;s, in an array of ever more extravagantly bowed cocktail dresses, she&#x27;s a bewitching stage presence, at once perilously provocative and child-like&quot;; while Ray Bennett of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; believed she brought &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;considerable depth&quot; to the part. In November 2009, Friel won an RTS Award for &quot;Best Performance in a Drama Series&quot; for her work as Dee, a struggling single mother who turns to prostitution, in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Street&quot;.

===2010–2019: &quot;Marcella&quot; and other leading roles ===
Friel had key parts in three films released in 2010: self-destructive Iris in the Woody Allen ensemble comedy &quot;You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger&quot;, ex-drug addict Melissa in Neil Burger&#x27;s lucrative sci-fi thriller &quot;Limitless&quot;, and depressed alcoholic Briony in the gangster drama &quot;London Boulevard&quot;, with her work in the latter being described as &quot;engaging&quot;. The following year, Friel played a fictionalised version of herself in an episode of the mockumentary series &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, as well as starring as a ruthless pirate in &quot;Neverland&quot; on the Syfy channel—a prequel to J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;—and earning strong notices for her performance in the three-part mystery drama series &quot;Without You&quot;. She then returned to the West End in a new version of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Vaudeville Theatre (November 2012 to February 2013), receiving praise for her role as aristocratic newlywed Yelena. Next, she appeared as a vilified probation officer in the BBC crime drama series &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2012) and headlined two British films: &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, a biopic where she played the long-suffering wife of self-made millionaire Paul Raymond, and the independent comedy-drama &quot;Having You&quot; (both 2013). In September 2013, Friel was cast as one of the main characters in the Ridley Scott-directed pilot &quot;The Vatican&quot;, though—due in part to a negative response from affiliates of the Catholic Church—Showtime decided not to proceed with a full series.

Friel was cast in the lead role of Sgt. Odelle Ballard, an American special ops soldier on a secret mission in Mali, West Africa, in the thriller series &quot;American Odyssey&quot;. The NBC show ran for a single season between April and June 2015, with some critics comparing it unfavourably to &quot;Homeland&quot;; though Friel&#x27;s performance was roundly praised. She starred that same year in the World War II-set Norwegian miniseries &quot;The Heavy Water War&quot; (known elsewhere as &quot;The Saboteurs&quot;), and in the drama film &quot;Urban and the Shed Crew&quot;, based on the memoir of the same name. Her next major film projects were the independent dark comedy &quot;The Cleanse&quot;, revenge thriller &quot;I.T.&quot; (both 2016), and the Irish-Canadian crime drama &quot;Tomato Red&quot; (2017), where her role as a trailer trash mother drew attention for being against type.

Friel began playing the eponymous Marcella Backland in the British Nordic noir detective series, &quot;Marcella&quot;, in 2016. Speaking of her decision to take on the part—a former policewoman who returns to work to investigate an unsolved serial killer case—she told a journalist prior to the debut of the second season, &quot;I nearly pulled out of [the job] after I&#x27;d accepted it [because] I just thought, &#x27;Oh God, how can I do this? There are so many amazing female detectives that have done it so well, I don&#x27;t know what I can offer differently&#x27; … so when [the first season] was received as well as it was, I thought maybe I had done something that is different and I&#x27;ve put my own ownership and my own stamp on it&quot;. In 2019, Friel collected the International Emmy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Backland, which &quot;Decider&quot; felt was &quot;extraordinary&quot;:

&quot;Marcella&quot;″s third and final season debuted on Netflix in 2020, with Friel commenting afterwards that a fourth season was unlikely to happen.

On the second season of &quot;The Girlfriend Experience&quot; (2017), an anthology drama series produced by Steven Soderbergh for the Starz network, Friel played Erica Myles, an ambitious financier engaged in dom-sub partnerships with multiple women. Her performance was described as &quot;outstanding&quot; by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;fantastic&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot;, who added, &quot;sometimes [the camera] just focuses on her eyes, which can either well up with frustrated tears or shutter in Erica&#x27;s emotions, as changeable as the sky reflected in a lake&quot;. Referring to the series&#x27; intense work schedule and the explicit nature of its sex scenes, Friel said that the role was her &quot;most challenging job to date&quot;. That same year, she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of a destitute mother in the six-part BBC drama &quot;Broken&quot;, with &quot;Metro&quot;″s Sarah Deen noting, &quot;Friel excellently [plays] Christina&#x27;s frantic desperation … all wild eyes, flapping shoes and dry humour (&#x27;I went to Mass and I got the sack. What am I gonna get tomorrow? Cystitis?&#x27;). You couldn&#x27;t tell if her wit was genuine or hastily developed as a defence mechanism to stop her from bursting into tears&quot;.

In the ITV drama series &quot;Butterfly&quot;, which aired over three weeks in October 2018, Friel starred as Vicky, the parent of a transgender child. Lucy Mangan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the show &quot;important, truthful ... a wonderfully delicate drama that covers new ground carefully and features fully realised characters&quot;, while the &quot;New Statesman&quot; felt that Friel&#x27;s portrayal of a mother &quot;racked by guilt&quot; was &quot;sterling&quot;. Friel said she and the show&#x27;s creators felt a great responsibility to make it as realistic as possible: &quot;We met all these wonderful families, who were saying, &#x27;please tell our story and tell it properly&#x27;. I said, &#x27;do you not feel represented?&#x27; And they said &#x27;no&#x27;. People have so many comments and opinions, but they actually can be somewhat ill-informed&quot;. The following year, Friel headlined the six-part miniseries &quot;Deep Water&quot;, which &quot;Metro&quot; described as a &quot;dark soap opera&quot;, adding, &quot;The performances, with a very human and relatable nasty streak running through each one, [elevate it] to a must-binge drama … Friel excels when it comes to playing harassed women, usually ones with a secret to keep, and the actress completely [disappears] into [her character] as she [fights] to get her marriage back&quot;.

===2020–present===

In the 2020 horror film &quot;Books of Blood&quot;, Friel played Mary, a grieving mother who makes contact with her late son. Based on a collection of stories by Clive Barker, &quot;Blood&quot; received mixed reviews, though critics remarked that Friel&#x27;s work was strong. Her next project was the starring role of Sharon Pici, a Kansas City detective, in Viaplay&#x27;s seven-part psychological thriller &quot;The Box&quot; (2021). The following year, she co-headlined the Fox musical drama series &quot;Monarch&quot; opposite Susan Sarandon. Friel played Nicolette &quot;Nicky&quot; Roman, a singer-songwriter trying to continue her family&#x27;s legacy while forging her own path in the country music industry. In his review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Max Gao said:

Friel performed every song that her character sings—a mixture of covers and originals—herself. It was announced in December 2022 that the series had been cancelled after one season.

In the period drama film &quot;Charming the Hearts of Men&quot; (2021), Friel played Grace Gordon, a woman fighting for civil rights in 1960s Southern America. Her work drew acclaim, with &quot;Film Threat&quot; commenting that her &quot;lived-in&quot; performance was key to &quot;Hearts&quot;″ success. She then appeared as Nicky, a Liverpudlian nurse helping one of her patients unravel a dark secret, in the British psychological thriller &quot;Locked In&quot; (2023).

==Other work==
Friel has featured in print and television advertising campaigns for brands such as Reebok, Virgin Atlantic, Mulberry, Three, Pantene, and Marks &amp; Spencer. 

In 2010, she co-starred with Michael Sheen in the music video for the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; single &quot;(It&#x27;s Not War) Just the End of Love&quot;, in which their characters were absorbed in a game of chess.

Friel works as an ambassador for the WWF wildlife charity.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Friel began a relationship with actor David Thewlis, after the pair met on a flight to Cannes. Later that year, Friel collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, needing emergency surgery and two blood transfusions for a ruptured ovarian cyst. It was discovered that she suffers from endometriosis and would have difficulty conceiving. Despite this, she later became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, Gracie Ellen Mary Friel, on 9 July 2005 at Portland Hospital, London. Gracie was named after Gracie Fields, and her mother&#x27;s grandmothers, Ellen and Mary. In December 2010, Friel and Thewlis separated after almost ten years together. Friel dated actor Rhys Ifans from 2011 to 2014.

<text>Eleanor Nancy Macpherson ( ; ; born ) is an Australian model, businesswoman, television host, and actress.

She is known for her record five cover appearances for the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; beginning in the 1980s, leading to her nickname &quot;The Body&quot;, coined by &quot;Time&quot; in 1989. She is the founder, primary model, and creative director for a series of business ventures, including Elle Macpherson Intimates, a lingerie line, and The Body, a line of skin care products. She was the host and executive producer of &quot;Britain &amp; Ireland&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; from 2010 to 2013. She is an executive producer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Star&quot; and was the host for the first season.

As an actress, Macpherson appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Sirens&quot; (1994), &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996) and as Julie Madison in &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; (1997) as well as lead roles in &quot;The Edge&quot; (1997) and &quot;South Kensington&quot; (2001). She had a recurring role on &quot;Friends&quot; and hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Early life==
Macpherson was born Eleanor Nancy Gow in Killara, New South Wales, on 29 March 1964, the daughter of entrepreneur and sound engineer Peter Gow, a former president of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, a Sydney rugby league team, and Frances Gow, a nurse. She is of Scottish descent. Macpherson&#x27;s parents divorced when she was 10 years old, and she moved with her mother and two siblings. Her mother later remarried, and a clerical mistake in registering at her new school meant that her surname was changed from Gow to Macpherson, her stepfather&#x27;s surname.

Macpherson grew up in East Lindfield, a suburb in Sydney&#x27;s North Shore, and attended Killara High School, completing her Higher School Certificate in 1981. She briefly studied law for one year at the University of Sydney. Her sister is businesswoman and environmentalist Mimi Macpherson, born Miriam Frances Gow.

==Career==
===Rise to fame as model===
Macpherson enrolled to study law at the University of Sydney. Before beginning her university studies, she visited the United States to spend one year doing modelling work to earn money to pay for her law books. She travelled to New York City, where she initially signed up with Click Model Management. Her modelling career began in 1982 with a television commercial for Tab which established her as a &quot;girl next door&quot; figure in Australia.
During the 1980s, Macpherson&#x27;s profile quickly rose, and she appeared on the cover and in the pages of major magazines including &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Allure, Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Officiel&quot;, &quot;Flare&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;New York&quot;. She cemented her high-profile image through frequent appearances in &quot;Elle&quot;; she was featured on numerous covers and appeared in every issue for six straight years. During that time, at the age of 21, she married Gilles Bensimon, the creative director of &quot;Elle&quot;. In 1985, Macpherson became the longtime face of luxury French skin care company Biotherm.
Eventually she garnered more exposure through &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Swimsuit Issue. She appeared on the cover a record five times: 1986, 1987, 1988, 1994, and 2006.

She has walked the runways for Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren, Azzedine Alaïa, Donna Karan, Christian Dior, Thierry Mugler, Nicole Miller, Michael Kors, Perry Ellis, Kenzo, Todd Oldham, Calvin Klein, John Galliano, and Valentino.

She has appeared in advertising campaigns for Christian Dior, Escada, Enrico Coveri, Azzedine Alaïa, Guy Laroche, Ralph Lauren, Victorio &amp; Lucchino, Omega, Pinko, H&amp;M, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, ModelCo and Revlon. She also appeared in non-fashion advertising campaigns for Diet Coke, Chrysler, Miller Lite, Impulse, Budweiser, Tab, KFC, Garuda Airlines, and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.

After appearing nude in the 1994 film &quot;Sirens&quot;, Macpherson learned that the media had begun searching for nude photos of her, including contacting her ex-boyfriends. To address this, Macpherson appeared in a nude pictorial in the May 1994 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, shot by Herb Ritts, to produce nude photos &quot;on her own terms&quot;. In 1999, the twin island nation of Antigua and Barbuda honoured Macpherson by using her face on a series of postage stamps, the first model to appear on legal tender. Macpherson appeared among other Australian icons during the 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, her elaborate float resembling a camera lens and featuring a runway. Along with Naomi Campbell, she co-hosted the Miss Universe 2001 pageant. Her popularity had reached such a level that Australian government offered her a position on its tourist commission as an unofficial ambassador.

During her career, Macpherson has worked with fashion photographers including Francesco Scavullo, Mario Testino, Mert and Marcus, Ellen von Unwerth and Steven Meisel. Portraits of Macpherson, shot by Bob Carlos Clarke, were among those donated to the National Portrait Gallery, London by his family following his death. Macpherson received the Style Icon award at the 2006 Elle Style Awards presented by fashion magazine &quot;Elle&quot;. In March 2008, she signed a three-year deal with Revlon Cosmetics, which named her a Global Brand Ambassador. She has since been featured in print and advertising campaigns for the company. She returned to the runway in 2010 to close the fall Louis Vuitton show for Marc Jacobs in Paris.

===Business career===

In the 1980s, together with Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, Naomi Campbell, Pavlína Pořízková, and Cindy Crawford, Macpherson became part of the new generation of supermodels. In 1989, she was given the nickname Elle &quot;The Body&quot; Macpherson by &quot;Time&quot; magazine after she appeared on their cover. She went on to use the name in a number of business ventures. In 1996, Frank DeCaro of &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited Macpherson, along with Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Claudia Schiffer as &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. DeCaro reflected, &quot;Known by their first names to legions of fans, they are the legends of the modern catwalk, the girl next door pretty underneath all the paint&quot;.

In 1994, she left her agency, Ford Models, to form her own company, Elle Macpherson Inc., which would serve as the financial organizational base for her later endeavours. She soon went on to produce her own series of calendars, each of which was accompanied by a &quot;making of&quot; television program in 1992, 1993, and 1994. She used this as a springboard to create the &quot;Your Personal Best – The Body&quot; series of workout videos.

She later diversified her portfolio of businesses, and in 1990 launched her lingerie collection &#x27;Elle Macpherson Intimates&#x27; in partnership with Bendon Limited Apparel. Intimates became the single best-selling lingerie line in both Great Britain and Australia.

The partnership was among the first instances of a crossover between a model and a fashion label. In 1989, when she was first approached by Bendon to promote their lingerie in Australia, Macpherson saw an opportunity to reverse their strategy and suggested a licensing arrangement, with products bearing her name and designs created in partnership with Bendon&#x27;s team. Though commonplace now, the idea was unorthodox at the time.

Macpherson took a significant role in the development and management of the company, serving as chief marketing officer and later Creative Director. In January 2010, Macpherson expanded the line, launching Obsidian as a sub-brand. While nursing her second child, she spearheaded the development of a signature maternity bra line. Intimates has retained a high brand recognition into the 2000s, appearing as a featured brand on &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;; last year, the brand celebrated 10 years of being stocked at Selfridges. 

Macpherson has also created her own line of beauty products: &quot;Elle Macpherson – The Body&quot;. The line was carried at Boots, and Australian suncare brand Invisible Zinc. She spent a year on the board of directors at Hot Tuna Clothing, advising on product development, brand positioning and sales strategy.

In 2007, the BBC TV series &quot;The Money Programme&quot; aired a documentary which followed Macpherson through her day-to-day business as she continued to develop her international lingerie business. In 2009 Macpherson delivered the Keynote Address at the annual meeting of the International Trademark Association.

In 2014, Macpherson co-founded WelleCo, and released its flagship product, an alkalising wellness supplement, &quot;The Super Elixir&quot;. The product, sold at retailers including Selfridges in London and the premium online retailer, Net-A-Porter has celebrity fans including Kate Moss.

====Awards====
Macpherson has received a number of awards recognising her business acumen and the success of Elle Macpherson Intimates. In 2005, she was named Glamour Magazine&#x27;s Entrepreneur of the Year; in 2007, she received an Everywoman Ambassador Award recognising her success as a businesswoman; in 2008, the Underfashion Club&#x27;s Femmy Awards crowned her Lingerie Designer of the Year and in 2009, she received a World Career Award from the Women&#x27;s World Awards.

===Acting career===

Macpherson made her film debut playing an artist&#x27;s model in the 1994 film &quot;Sirens&quot;, which starred Hugh Grant, Sam Neill, and Tara FitzGerald. She followed with a two-year sequence of film roles, appearing in films such as Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; alongside George Clooney, &quot;The Edge&quot; with Anthony Hopkins, and &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; with Barbra Streisand. In 1996 Macpherson hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In 1999, Macpherson appeared in five episodes of the American TV series &quot;Friends&quot; as Joey Tribbiani&#x27;s roommate and eventual girlfriend, Janine Lecroix. Macpherson went on to act in the movie &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; with William Hurt, and she has also appeared alongside Ben Stiller and Sarah Jessica Parker in &quot;If Lucy Fell&quot;. Her most controversial acting role was in the Showtime cable network miniseries, &quot;A Girl Thing&quot;, as a woman experimenting with bisexuality. In 2001, she appeared in the Italian movie &quot;South Kensington&quot;. She played agent Claudia Foster in &quot;The Beautiful Life&quot;, appearing with Mischa Barton, Sara Paxton and Corbin Bleu. The show centred on aspiring models working for a modelling agency, trying to make it big in New York City and in the fashion world. In April 2011, she starred with Gary Lineker in an advertisement for Walkers Crinkles.

=== Hosting career ===

====&quot;Britain and Ireland&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;====
In July 2010, Macpherson became the new host of &quot;Britain and Ireland&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, taking over from Lisa Snowdon. She also serves as executive producer on the show. The revamped show&#x27;s panellists now include OBE-winning fashion designer Julien Macdonald, designer Whitney Port and male model Tyson Beckford.

====&quot;Fashion Star&quot;====
Macpherson hosts and executive produces NBC&#x27;s reality competition series &quot;Fashion Star&quot;. The series gives 14 unknown designers, mentored by celebrities such as Jessica Simpson, Nicole Richie, and John Varvatos, the chance to launch their collections in three of America&#x27;s largest clothing retailers, including Macy&#x27;s, H&amp;M, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Its first season was sold to 75 countries.

===Extortion attempt===
According to a police statement reproduced online, between 11 and 22 July 1997 William Ryan Holt and Michael Mischler broke into Macpherson&#x27;s Los Angeles home while she was away on business in Chicago. They stole an estimated $100,000 worth of jewellery, $6,000 in cash, and several photographs. The two were arrested on 4 August 1997. Mischler, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted extortion and one count of burglary. He received a six-year and eight-month prison sentence. Holt, 26, a former US Air Force enlisted man and a military-justice convict out on parole, pleaded guilty to one count of extortion, and was sentenced to a year in prison.

==Personal life==
Macpherson dated Billy Joel during the early 1980s. Joel has said that the songs &quot;This Night&quot; and &quot;And So It Goes&quot; were written about his relationship with Macpherson. Macpherson is also believed to be at least part of the inspiration for Joel&#x27;s track &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;.

Macpherson met French fashion photographer Gilles Bensimon in 1984 on a photo session for &quot;Elle&quot; magazine. They wed in May 1986, and divorced three years later.

Macpherson began a relationship with financier Arpad Busson in 1996. They have two sons. The family lived together in London until their separation in July 2005.

Macpherson subsequently began dating Miami, Florida-based hotel heir and billionaire Jeffrey Soffer, son of Donald Soffer, in early 2009. They broke up in March 2012, but reconciled following his injury in a helicopter accident in November 2012. They became engaged in March 2013, and married in July 2013 at the Laucala Resort in Fiji. 

In 2017, Macpherson and Soffer announced that they were getting a divorce. That same year, Macpherson underwent treatment for breast cancer, specifically HER2 positive estrogen receptor positive ductal carcinoma in situ. Her doctors recommended a mastectomy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and breast reconstruction surgery, but she decided to have a lumpectomy instead of mastectomy, followed by holistic medicine instead of chemotherapy.

From 2017 to 2019, Macpherson dated the British anti-vaccine activist and discredited academic Andrew Wakefield.

Besides English, Macpherson speaks French, Italian and Spanish.

===Philanthropy===
Macpherson is a European Ambassador for Product Red, an initiative set up by Bono and Bobby Shriver to raise money and awareness for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and to help eradicate AIDS for women and children in Africa. She is also an ambassador for UNICEF.

In Australia, she is an ambassador for the Smile Foundation, which helps the families of children with rare diseases and organises government research grants. She has also modelled for charitable causes including fundraising for 2007 British flood victims, and child welfare group Absolute Return for Kids.

In 2012, Macpherson led Sky&#x27;s campaign for International Women&#x27;s Day. 

Macpherson is a patron for the National Association for the Children of Alcoholics (Nacoa UK).

<text>The raspberry is the edible fruit of several plant species in the genus &quot;Rubus&quot; of the rose family, most of which are in the subgenus &quot;Idaeobatus&quot;. The name also applies to these plants themselves. Raspberries are perennial with woody stems. 

World production of raspberries in 2022 was 947,852 tonnes, led by Russia with 22% of the total. Raspberries are cultivated across northern Europe and North America and are consumed in various ways, including as whole fruit and in preserves, cakes, ice cream, and liqueurs. Raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C, manganese, and dietary fiber.

== Description ==
A raspberry is an aggregate fruit, developing from the numerous distinct carpels of a single flower. What distinguishes the raspberry from its blackberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle or stem) &quot;picks with&quot; (i.e., stays with) the fruit. When picking a blackberry fruit, the torus stays with the fruit. With a raspberry, the torus remains on the plant, leaving a hollow core in the raspberry fruit.

Raspberries are grown for the fresh fruit market and for commercial processing into individually quick frozen (IQF) fruit, purée, juice, or dried fruit used in a variety of grocery products such as raspberry pie. Raspberries need ample sun and water for optimal development. Raspberries thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 7 with ample organic matter to assist in retaining water. While moisture is essential, wet and heavy soils or excess irrigation can bring on &quot;Phytophthora&quot; root rot, which is one of the most serious pest problems faced by the red raspberry. As a cultivated plant in moist, temperate regions, it is easy to grow and tends to spread unless pruned. Escaped raspberries frequently appear as garden weeds, spread by seeds found in bird droppings.

An individual raspberry weighs and is made up of around 100 drupelets, each of which consists of a juicy pulp and a single central seed. A raspberry bush can yield several hundred berries a year.

== Etymology ==
Raspberry derives its name from &quot;raspise&quot;, &quot;a sweet rose-colored wine&quot; (mid-15th century), from the Anglo-Latin &quot;vinum raspeys&quot;, or from &quot;raspoie&quot;, meaning &quot;thicket&quot;, of Germanic origin. The name may have been influenced by its appearance as having a rough surface, related to the Old English &quot;rasp&quot; or &quot;rough berry&quot;.

== Species ==

Examples of raspberry species in &quot;Rubus&quot; subgenus &quot;Idaeobatus&quot; include:
* &quot;Rubus crataegifolius&quot; (Asian raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus gunnianus&quot; (Tasmanian alpine raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; (red raspberry or European red raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus leucodermis&quot; (whitebark raspberry or western raspberry, blue raspberry, black raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus occidentalis&quot; (black raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus parvifolius&quot; (Australian native raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus phoenicolasius&quot; (wine raspberry or wineberry)
* &quot;Rubus rosifolius&quot; (Mauritius raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus strigosus&quot; (American red raspberry) (syn. &quot;R. idaeus&quot; var. &quot;strigosus&quot;)
* &quot;Rubus ellipticus&quot; (yellow Himalayan raspberry)
* &quot;Rubus fraxinifolius&quot; (mountain raspberry, in southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean)

Several species of &quot;Rubus&quot;, also called raspberries, are classified in other subgenera, including:
* &quot;Rubus deliciosus&quot; (boulder raspberry, subgenus &quot;Anoplobatus&quot;)
* &quot;Rubus odoratus&quot; (flowering raspberry, subgenus &quot;Anoplobatus&quot;)
* &quot;Rubus nivalis&quot; (snow raspberry, subgenus &quot;Chamaebatus&quot;)
* &quot;Rubus arcticus&quot; (Arctic raspberry, subgenus &quot;Cyclactis&quot;)
* &quot;Rubus sieboldii&quot; (Molucca raspberry, subgenus &quot;Malachobatus&quot;)

== Cultivation ==

Various kinds of raspberries can be cultivated from hardiness zones 3 to 9. Raspberries are traditionally planted in the winter as dormant canes, although planting of tender, plug plants produced by tissue culture has become much more common. A specialized production system called &quot;long cane production&quot; involves growing canes for a year in a northern climate such as Scotland or Oregon or Washington, where the chilling requirement for proper bud break is attained, or attained earlier than the ultimate place of planting. These canes are then dug, roots and all, to be replanted in warmer climates such as Spain, where they quickly flower and produce a very early season crop. Plants are typically planted 2–6 per m in fertile, well drained soil; raspberries are usually planted in raised beds/ridges, if there is any question about root rot problems.

All cultivars of raspberries have perennial roots, but many do not have perennial shoots. In fact, most raspberries have shoots that are biennial (meaning shoots grow in the first growing season and fruits grow on those shoots during the second growing season). The flowers can be a major nectar source for honeybees and other pollinators.

Raspberries are vigorous and can be locally invasive. They propagate using basal shoots (also known as suckers), extended underground shoots that develop roots and individual plants. They can sucker new canes some distance from the main plant. For this reason, raspberries spread well, and can take over gardens if left unchecked. Raspberries are often propagated using cuttings, and will root readily in moist soil conditions.

The fruit is harvested when it comes off the receptacle easily and has turned a deep color (red, black, purple, or golden yellow, depending on the species and cultivar). This is when the fruits are ripest and sweetest.

High tunnel bramble production offers the opportunity to bridge gaps in availability during late fall and late spring. Furthermore, high tunnels allow less hardy floricane-fruiting raspberries to overwinter in climates where they would not otherwise survive. In the tunnel, plants are established at close spacing usually prior to tunnel construction.

=== Cultivars ===
==== Major cultivars ====

Raspberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world. Many of the most important modern commercial red raspberry cultivars derive from hybrids between &quot;R. idaeus&quot; and &quot;R. strigosus&quot;. Some botanists consider the Eurasian and American red raspberries to belong to a single, circumboreal species, &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot;, with the European plants then classified as either &quot;R. idaeus&quot; subsp. &quot;idaeus&quot; or &quot;R. idaeus&quot; var. &quot;idaeus&quot;, and the native North American red raspberries classified as either &quot;R. idaeus&quot; subsp. &quot;strigosus&quot;, or &quot;R. idaeus&quot; var. &quot;strigosus&quot;. Recent breeding has resulted in cultivars that are thornless and more strongly upright, not needing staking.

The black raspberry, &quot;Rubus occidentalis&quot;, is also cultivated, providing both fresh and frozen fruit, as well as jams, preserves, and other products, all with that species&#x27; distinctive flavor.

Purple raspberries have been produced by horticultural hybridization of red and black raspberries, and have also been found in the wild in a few places (for example, in Vermont) where the American red and the black raspberries both grow naturally. Commercial production of purple-fruited raspberries is rare. 

&quot;Blue raspberry&quot; is a local name used in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada, for the cultivar &#x27;Columbian&#x27;, a hybrid (purple raspberry) of &quot;R. strigosus&quot; and &quot;R. occidentalis&quot;. &quot;Blue raspberry&quot; can also refer to the whitebark raspberry, &quot;R. leucodermis&quot;.

Both the red and the black raspberry species have albino-like pale-yellow natural or horticultural variants, resulting from presence of recessive genes that impede production of anthocyanin pigments. Fruits from such plants are called golden raspberries or yellow raspberries; despite their similar appearance, they retain the distinctive flavor of their respective species (red or black). Most pale-fruited raspberries commercially sold in the eastern United States are derivatives of red raspberries. Yellow-fruited variants of the black raspberry are sometimes grown in home gardens.

Red raspberries have also been crossed with various species in other subgenera of the genus &quot;Rubus&quot;, resulting in a number of hybrids, the first of which was the loganberry. Later notable hybrids include the olallieberry, boysenberry, marionberry, and tayberry; all are multi-generational hybrids. Hybridization between the familiar cultivated red raspberries and a few Asiatic species of &quot;Rubus&quot; has also been achieved.

==== Selected cultivars ====
Numerous raspberry cultivars have been selected.

Two types of raspberry are available for commercial and domestic cultivation; the summer-bearing type produces an abundance of fruit on second-year canes (floricanes) within a relatively short period in midsummer, and double or &quot;everbearing&quot; plants, which also bear some fruit on first-year canes (primocanes) in the late summer and fall, as well as the summer crop on second-year canes. Those marked (AGM) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

=== Diseases and pests ===
Raspberries are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths). More serious are the raspberry beetle (in Europe) and the raspberry fruitworm (in North America), whose larvae can damage raspberries.

&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, or gray mold, is a common fungal infection of raspberries and other soft fruit under wet conditions. It is seen as a gray mold growing on the raspberries, and particularly affects fruit which are bruised, as the bruises provide an easy entrance point for the spores.

Raspberry plants should not be planted where potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, or bulbs have previously been grown, without prior fumigation of the soil. These crops are hosts for the disease &quot;Verticillium&quot; wilt, a fungus that can stay in the soil for many years and can infest the raspberry crop.

==== Animals ====
Raspberries, among other plants with high sugar content like peaches, are prime targets for the Japanese beetle, which relies heavily on these sources as its main food resource. The voracious feeding habits of Japanese beetles not only pose a direct threat to raspberry plants but also increase the risk of transmitting various plant diseases. This dual impact can significantly undermine agricultural productivity, making it crucial for raspberry growers to implement effective pest management strategies to mitigate the damage caused by Japanese beetle infestations. 

== Production ==

In 2022, world production of raspberries was 947,852 tonnes, led by Russia with 22% of the total (table). Other major producers were Mexico, Serbia, Poland, and the United States.

== Nutrition ==
Raw raspberries are 86% water, 12% carbohydrates, and have about 1% each of protein and fat (table). In a reference amount of , raspberries supply 53 kilocalories and 6.5 grams of dietary fiber. Raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C (29% of the Daily Value, DV), manganese (29% DV), and dietary fiber (26% DV), but otherwise have low content of micronutrients (table). Raspberries are a low-glycemic index food, with total sugar content of only 4% and no starch.

The aggregate fruit structure contributes to raspberry&#x27;s nutritional value, as it increases the proportion of dietary fiber, which is among the highest known in whole foods up to 6% fiber per total weight.

=== Phytochemicals ===
Raspberries contain phytochemicals, such as anthocyanin pigments, ellagic acid, ellagitannins, quercetin, gallic acid, cyanidins, pelargonidins, catechins, kaempferol and salicylic acid. Yellow raspberries and others with pale-colored fruits are lower in anthocyanin content. Both yellow and red raspberries contain carotenoids, mostly lutein esters, but these are masked by anthocyanins in red raspberries.

Raspberry compounds are under preliminary research for their potential to affect human health.

=== Leaves ===
Raspberry leaves can be used fresh or dried in herbal teas, providing an astringent flavor. In herbal and traditional medicine, raspberry leaves are used for some remedies, although there is no scientifically valid evidence to support their medicinal use.

<text>In mathematics, a module is a generalization of the notion of vector space in which the field of scalars is replaced by a (not necessarily commutative) ring. The concept of a &quot;module&quot; also generalizes the notion of an abelian group, since the abelian groups are exactly the modules over the ring of integers.

Like a vector space, a module is an additive abelian group, and scalar multiplication is distributive over the operations of addition between elements of the ring or module and is compatible with the ring multiplication.

Modules are very closely related to the representation theory of groups. They are also one of the central notions of commutative algebra and homological algebra, and are used widely in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.

== Introduction and definition ==

=== Motivation ===
In a vector space, the set of scalars is a field and acts on the vectors by scalar multiplication, subject to certain axioms such as the distributive law. In a module, the scalars need only be a ring, so the module concept represents a significant generalization. In commutative algebra, both ideals and quotient rings are modules, so that many arguments about ideals or quotient rings can be combined into a single argument about modules. In non-commutative algebra, the distinction between left ideals, ideals, and modules becomes more pronounced, though some ring-theoretic conditions can be expressed either about left ideals or left modules.

Much of the theory of modules consists of extending as many of the desirable properties of vector spaces as possible to the realm of modules over a &quot;well-behaved&quot; ring, such as a principal ideal domain. However, modules can be quite a bit more complicated than vector spaces; for instance, not all modules have a basis, and, even for those that do (free modules), the number of elements in a basis need not be the same for all bases (that is to say that they may not have a unique rank) if the underlying ring does not satisfy the invariant basis number condition, unlike vector spaces, which always have a (possibly infinite) basis whose cardinality is then unique. (These last two assertions require the axiom of choice in general, but not in the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces, or certain well-behaved infinite-dimensional vector spaces such as L&quot;p&quot; spaces.)

=== Formal definition ===
Suppose that &quot;R&quot; is a ring, and 1 is its multiplicative identity.
A left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; consists of an abelian group and an operation such that for all &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, we have
#formula_1,
#formula_2,
#formula_3,
#formula_4

The operation · is called &quot;scalar multiplication&quot;. Often the symbol · is omitted, but in this article we use it and reserve juxtaposition for multiplication in &quot;R&quot;. One may write &quot;R&quot;&quot;M&quot; to emphasize that &quot;M&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module. A right &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;&quot;R&quot; is defined similarly in terms of an operation .

Authors who do not require rings to be unital omit condition 4 in the definition above; they would call the structures defined above &quot;unital left &quot;R&quot;-modules&quot;. In this article, consistent with the glossary of ring theory, all rings and modules are assumed to be unital.

An (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;S&quot;)-bimodule is an abelian group together with both a left scalar multiplication · by elements of &quot;R&quot; and a right scalar multiplication ∗ by elements of &quot;S&quot;, making it simultaneously a left &quot;R&quot;-module and a right &quot;S&quot;-module, satisfying the additional condition for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;.

If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, then left &quot;R&quot;-modules are the same as right &quot;R&quot;-modules and are simply called &quot;R&quot;-modules.

== Examples ==

*If &quot;K&quot; is a field, then &quot;K&quot;-modules are called &quot;K&quot;-vector spaces (vector spaces over &quot;K&quot;).
*If &quot;K&quot; is a field, and &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] a univariate polynomial ring, then a &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]-module &quot;M&quot; is a &quot;K&quot;-module with an additional action of &quot;x&quot; on &quot;M&quot; by a group homomorphism that commutes with the action of &quot;K&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. In other words, a &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]-module is a &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;M&quot; combined with a linear map from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;M&quot;. Applying the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain to this example shows the existence of the rational and Jordan canonical forms.
*The concept of a Z-module agrees with the notion of an abelian group. That is, every abelian group is a module over the ring of integers Z in a unique way. For , let (&quot;n&quot; summands), , and . Such a module need not have a basis—groups containing torsion elements do not. (For example, in the group of integers modulo 3, one cannot find even one element that satisfies the definition of a linearly independent set, since when an integer such as 3 or 6 multiplies an element, the result is 0. However, if a finite field is considered as a module over the same finite field taken as a ring, it is a vector space and does have a basis.)
*The decimal fractions (including negative ones) form a module over the integers. Only singletons are linearly independent sets, but there is no singleton that can serve as a basis, so the module has no basis and no rank, in the usual sense of linear algebra. However this module has a torsion-free rank equal to 1.
*If &quot;R&quot; is any ring and &quot;n&quot; a natural number, then the cartesian product &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; is both a left and right &quot;R&quot;-module over &quot;R&quot; if we use the component-wise operations. Hence when , &quot;R&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module, where the scalar multiplication is just ring multiplication. The case yields the trivial &quot;R&quot;-module {0} consisting only of its identity element. Modules of this type are called free and if &quot;R&quot; has invariant basis number (e.g. any commutative ring or field) the number &quot;n&quot; is then the rank of the free module.
*If M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is the ring of matrices over a ring &quot;R&quot;, &quot;M&quot; is an M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)-module, and &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the matrix with 1 in the -entry (and zeros elsewhere), then &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;M&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module, since . So &quot;M&quot; breaks up as the direct sum of &quot;R&quot;-modules, . Conversely, given an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;0, then &quot;M&quot;0⊕&quot;n&quot; is an M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)-module. In fact, the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules and the category of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)-modules are equivalent. The special case is that the module &quot;M&quot; is just &quot;R&quot; as a module over itself, then &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; is an M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)-module.
*If &quot;S&quot; is a nonempty set, &quot;M&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module, and &quot;M&quot;&quot;S&quot; is the collection of all functions , then with addition and scalar multiplication in &quot;M&quot;&quot;S&quot; defined pointwise by and , &quot;M&quot;&quot;S&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module. The right &quot;R&quot;-module case is analogous. In particular, if &quot;R&quot; is commutative then the collection of &quot;R-module homomorphisms&quot; (see below) is an &quot;R&quot;-module (and in fact a &quot;submodule&quot; of &quot;N&quot;&quot;M&quot;).
*If &quot;X&quot; is a smooth manifold, then the smooth functions from &quot;X&quot; to the real numbers form a ring &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;). The set of all smooth vector fields defined on &quot;X&quot; forms a module over &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;), and so do the tensor fields and the differential forms on &quot;X&quot;. More generally, the sections of any vector bundle form a projective module over &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;), and by Swan&#x27;s theorem, every projective module is isomorphic to the module of sections of some vector bundle; the category of &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;)-modules and the category of vector bundles over &quot;X&quot; are equivalent.
*If &quot;R&quot; is any ring and &quot;I&quot; is any left ideal in &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;I&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module, and analogously right ideals in &quot;R&quot; are right &quot;R&quot;-modules.
*If &quot;R&quot; is a ring, we can define the opposite ring &quot;R&quot;op, which has the same underlying set and the same addition operation, but the opposite multiplication: if in &quot;R&quot;, then in &quot;R&quot;op. Any &quot;left&quot; &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; can then be seen to be a &quot;right&quot; module over &quot;R&quot;op, and any right module over &quot;R&quot; can be considered a left module over &quot;R&quot;op.
* Modules over a Lie algebra are (associative algebra) modules over its universal enveloping algebra.
*If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are rings with a ring homomorphism , then every &quot;S&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module by defining . In particular, &quot;S&quot; itself is such an &quot;R&quot;-module.

== Submodules and homomorphisms ==

Suppose &quot;M&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;N&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;M&quot;. Then &quot;N&quot; is a submodule (or more explicitly an &quot;R&quot;-submodule) if for any &quot;n&quot; in &quot;N&quot; and any &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, the product (or for a right &quot;R&quot;-module) is in &quot;N&quot;.

If &quot;X&quot; is any subset of an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, then the submodule spanned by &quot;X&quot; is defined to be formula_5 where &quot;N&quot; runs over the submodules of &quot;M&quot; that contain &quot;X&quot;, or explicitly formula_6, which is important in the definition of tensor products of modules. 

The set of submodules of a given module &quot;M&quot;, together with the two binary operations + (the module spanned by the union of the arguments) and ∩, forms a lattice that satisfies the modular law:
Given submodules &quot;U&quot;, &quot;N&quot;1, &quot;N&quot;2 of &quot;M&quot; such that , then the following two submodules are equal: .

If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are left &quot;R&quot;-modules, then a map is a homomorphism of &quot;R&quot;-modules if for any &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; in &quot;M&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; in &quot;R&quot;,
:formula_7.
This, like any homomorphism of mathematical objects, is just a mapping that preserves the structure of the objects. Another name for a homomorphism of &quot;R&quot;-modules is an &quot;R&quot;-linear map.

A bijective module homomorphism is called a module isomorphism, and the two modules &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are called isomorphic. Two isomorphic modules are identical for all practical purposes, differing solely in the notation for their elements.

The kernel of a module homomorphism is the submodule of &quot;M&quot; consisting of all elements that are sent to zero by &quot;f&quot;, and the image of &quot;f&quot; is the submodule of &quot;N&quot; consisting of values &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) for all elements &quot;m&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. The isomorphism theorems familiar from groups and vector spaces are also valid for &quot;R&quot;-modules.

Given a ring &quot;R&quot;, the set of all left &quot;R&quot;-modules together with their module homomorphisms forms an abelian category, denoted by &quot;R&quot;-Mod (see category of modules).

== Types of modules ==
; Finitely generated: An &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated if there exist finitely many elements &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; in &quot;M&quot; such that every element of &quot;M&quot; is a linear combination of those elements with coefficients from the ring &quot;R&quot;.
; Cyclic: A module is called a cyclic module if it is generated by one element.
; Free: A free &quot;R&quot;-module is a module that has a basis, or equivalently, one that is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the ring &quot;R&quot;. These are the modules that behave very much like vector spaces.
; Projective: Projective modules are direct summands of free modules and share many of their desirable properties.
; Injective: Injective modules are defined dually to projective modules.
; Flat: A module is called flat if taking the tensor product of it with any exact sequence of &quot;R&quot;-modules preserves exactness.
; Torsionless: A module is called torsionless if it embeds into its algebraic dual.
; Simple: A simple module &quot;S&quot; is a module that is not {0} and whose only submodules are {0} and &quot;S&quot;. Simple modules are sometimes called &quot;irreducible&quot;.
; Semisimple: A semisimple module is a direct sum (finite or not) of simple modules. Historically these modules are also called &quot;completely reducible&quot;.
; Indecomposable: An indecomposable module is a non-zero module that cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-zero submodules. Every simple module is indecomposable, but there are indecomposable modules that are not simple (e.g. uniform modules).
; Faithful: A faithful module &quot;M&quot; is one where the action of each in &quot;R&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is nontrivial (i.e. for some &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;). Equivalently, the annihilator of &quot;M&quot; is the zero ideal.
; Torsion-free: A torsion-free module is a module over a ring such that 0 is the only element annihilated by a regular element (non zero-divisor) of the ring, equivalently implies or .
; Noetherian: A Noetherian module is a module that satisfies the ascending chain condition on submodules, that is, every increasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps. Equivalently, every submodule is finitely generated.
; Artinian: An Artinian module is a module that satisfies the descending chain condition on submodules, that is, every decreasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps.
; Graded: A graded module is a module with a decomposition as a direct sum over a graded ring such that for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.
; Uniform: A uniform module is a module in which all pairs of nonzero submodules have nonzero intersection.

=== Relation to representation theory ===

A representation of a group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is a module over the group ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;G&quot;].

If &quot;M&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module, then the &quot;action&quot; of an element &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; is defined to be the map that sends each &quot;x&quot; to &quot;rx&quot; (or &quot;xr&quot; in the case of a right module), and is necessarily a group endomorphism of the abelian group . The set of all group endomorphisms of &quot;M&quot; is denoted EndZ(&quot;M&quot;) and forms a ring under addition and composition, and sending a ring element &quot;r&quot; of &quot;R&quot; to its action actually defines a ring homomorphism from &quot;R&quot; to EndZ(&quot;M&quot;).

Such a ring homomorphism is called a &quot;representation&quot; of the abelian group &quot;M&quot; over the ring &quot;R&quot;; an alternative and equivalent way of defining left &quot;R&quot;-modules is to say that a left &quot;R&quot;-module is an abelian group &quot;M&quot; together with a representation of &quot;M&quot; over &quot;R&quot;. Such a representation may also be called a &quot;ring action&quot; of &quot;R&quot; on &quot;M&quot;.

A representation is called &quot;faithful&quot; if the map is injective. In terms of modules, this means that if &quot;r&quot; is an element of &quot;R&quot; such that for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, then . Every abelian group is a faithful module over the integers or over the ring of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;, Z/&quot;n&quot;Z, for some &quot;n&quot;.

=== Generalizations ===
A ring &quot;R&quot; corresponds to a preadditive category R with a single object. With this understanding, a left &quot;R&quot;-module is just a covariant additive functor from R to the category Ab of abelian groups, and right &quot;R&quot;-modules are contravariant additive functors. This suggests that, if C is any preadditive category, a covariant additive functor from C to Ab should be considered a generalized left module over C. These functors form a functor category C-Mod, which is the natural generalization of the module category &quot;R&quot;-Mod.

Modules over &quot;commutative&quot; rings can be generalized in a different direction: take a ringed space (&quot;X&quot;, O&quot;X&quot;) and consider the sheaves of O&quot;X&quot;-modules (see sheaf of modules). These form a category O&quot;X&quot;-Mod, and play an important role in modern algebraic geometry. If &quot;X&quot; has only a single point, then this is a module category in the old sense over the commutative ring O&quot;X&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

One can also consider modules over a semiring. Modules over rings are abelian groups, but modules over semirings are only commutative monoids. Most applications of modules are still possible. In particular, for any semiring &quot;S&quot;, the matrices over &quot;S&quot; form a semiring over which the tuples of elements from &quot;S&quot; are a module (in this generalized sense only). This allows a further generalization of the concept of vector space incorporating the semirings from theoretical computer science.

Over near-rings, one can consider near-ring modules, a nonabelian generalization of modules.

<text>Catherine Jane McCormack (born 3 April 1972) is an English actress. Her film appearances include &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), &quot;The Land Girls&quot; (1998), &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot; (1998), &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; (1998), &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001), and &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007). Her theatre work includes National Theatre productions of &quot;All My Sons&quot; (2000) and &quot;Honour&quot; (2003).

== Early life ==
McCormack was born in Epsom, Surrey, England. She is of part Irish ancestry as one of her grandfathers was Irish. Her mother died of lupus when McCormack was six years old and her steelworker father subsequently raised her and her brother Stephen. She was brought up as Roman Catholic and attended the Convent of Our Lady of Providence. She went on to study at the Oxford School of Drama.

== Career ==
=== Film ===
McCormack&#x27;s screen debut was as the lead in the Anna Campion-directed film &quot;Loaded&quot; (1994). She has subsequently stated that she had a &quot;miserable time with the director (Anna Campion)... it was my first film job, I needed to be mollycoddled, I needed to be helped through it, and I wasn&#x27;t. Mostly, it was a horrible experience.&quot; Her first important role was as Murron MacClannough in the multiple Academy Award-winning film &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995).

After &quot;Braveheart&quot;, McCormack starred alongside Anna Friel and Rachel Weisz in David Leland&#x27;s &quot;The Land Girls&quot; and had lead roles in Nils Gaup&#x27;s &quot;Northstar&quot; and Marshall Herskovitz&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot;. Other films include &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001) and &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;. In 1998, she stated that &quot;I read very few scripts I&#x27;m passionate about... Maybe one in every twenty or thirty.&quot;

=== Theatre ===
McCormack has shown a preference in her career for the theatre, saying that &quot;theatre really is an actor&#x27;s medium: you&#x27;re on stage with no director anymore, whereas in film very rarely do you get much rehearsal other than running through the scene very quickly. Then everyone comes in and shoots it.&quot; McCormack was one of the original 2006 London cast of Patrick Barlow&#x27;s play of &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;. In 2008, she performed the role of Nora in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, directed by Peter Hall at the Theatre Royal, Bath, and also the role of Isabel Archer in a stage adaptation of &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, both of which commenced their runs in July 2008, ending in August, before transferring to the Rose Theatre in Kingston later that year.

In 2009, she appeared in the British tour of Headlong&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;. In 2012, she starred as Juana Inés de la Cruz in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of Helen Edmundson&#x27;s play &quot;The Heresy of Love&quot;.

==Personal life==
As of 2009, McCormack was living with her boyfriend in Richmond.

Beginning his career as a child actor, Osment&#x27;s role in the comedy-drama film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994) won him a Young Artist Award. His breakthrough came with the psychological thriller film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), which won him a Saturn Award and earned him nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

His further on-screen work includes appearing in the body horror film &quot;Tusk&quot; (2014), the comedy films &quot;Sex Ed&quot; (2014), &quot;Entourage&quot; (2015), &quot;Izzy Gets the F*ck Across Town&quot; (2017) and &quot;Clara&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (2018), and the drama films &quot;Almost Friends&quot; (2016), &quot;Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile&quot; (2019) and &quot;Somebody I Used to Know&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Haley Joel Osment was born on April 10, 1988, in Los Angeles, California, the son of Theresa (), a teacher, and Michael Eugene Osment, a theater and film actor, both natives of Birmingham, Alabama. Osment was raised Roman Catholic. He has a younger sister, Emily, who is also an actress. Osment&#x27;s parents have described his childhood as a &quot;good old-fashioned Southern upbringing&quot;. His father said that when Osment was learning to speak, he deliberately avoided using baby talk when communicating with his son. As a child, he wrestled and played basketball, football, and golf.

Osment was a student at Flintridge Preparatory School in La Cañada Flintridge, California. He graduated from New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in 2011.

==Career==
Visiting a store at age four, Osment signed up with a talent scout. Called back for an audition, he was asked to describe the biggest thing he had ever seen; his description of an IMAX theater screen helped win him a part in a Pizza Hut TV commercial. The commercial launched his career, and later that year he starred in the ABC TV sitcom &quot;Thunder Alley&quot;, his first role in series television. His first feature film role was as Forrest Gump&#x27;s son in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. He also had a small part in another 1994 film, &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, Osment played regular or recurring roles in various TV series; including &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot; and the final season of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, where he replaced Dyllan Christopher as Murphy&#x27;s son, Avery.
In addition, he made numerous guest appearances on shows, including &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. He appeared in the 1996 film &quot;Bogus&quot;, alongside Whoopi Goldberg and Gérard Depardieu and the 1998 television film &quot;The Lake&quot;, as well as &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot; (1999), with future &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; co-star Trevor Morgan.

Osment first achieved stardom in 1999, when he appeared in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, co-starring Bruce Willis. For his portrayal of Cole Sear, a psychic child, Osment won the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor. He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, becoming the second-youngest performer ever to receive an Academy nomination for a supporting role, but lost the final Oscar vote to Michael Caine (with whom he would later work, appearing together in &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;). One of Osment&#x27;s lines in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;I see dead people,&quot; became a popular catchphrase and is often repeated or parodied on television programs and in other media. The phrase is #44 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of 100 Movie Quotes. He made three minor appearances on the animated TV series &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 2000 and 2001.

In 2000 Osment had a leading role as Trevor McKinney in &quot;Pay It Forward&quot;, which received mixed reviews. The following year, he appeared in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, cementing his stature as one of the leading young actors in Hollywood. This role earned him his second Saturn Award for Best Younger Actor, and further critical acclaim. In reviewing the film, critic Roger Ebert claimed that: &quot;Osment, who is onscreen in almost every scene, is one of the best actors now working&quot;. In 2001, Osment starred in the Polish film, &quot;Edges of the Lord&quot;, as Romek. The film was never released theatrically in the United States. Between 2002 and 2003, Osment lent his voice to films such as &quot;The Country Bears&quot;, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; (Jake Thomas auditioned for the role of Mowgli prior to Osment&#x27;s casting), all from Walt Disney Pictures. He returned to live action with the 2003 film, &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;.

Osment lent his voice to the video game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, providing the voice of Sora, the series&#x27; main character, and also Vanitas, a villain from the same series. Osment also voiced the character of Takeshi Jin in the English version of the &quot;Immortal Grand Prix&quot; anime television series.

He appeared in &quot;Home of the Giants&quot;, playing a high school journalist opposite Ryan Merriman and Danielle Panabaker. He subsequently worked on &quot;Montana Amazon&quot; as both an actor and executive producer. The film starred Olympia Dukakis and debuted at the Orlando and Big Apple Film Festivals in November 2010, winning Best Feature Film at the latter.

Osment made his Broadway debut at the Belasco Theatre in November 2008 playing the role of Bobby, a young heroin addict, in a revival of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;American Buffalo&quot;; co-starring with John Leguizamo and Cedric the Entertainer. The show opened to mixed reviews, and a provisional statement was made on November 20, 2008, that it would close after the first week.

In 2010, Osment signed for a leading role in the comedy film &quot;Sex Ed&quot; from MPCA, to play a college graduate who wants to teach geometry, but ends up as a sex education teacher while inexperienced himself. In January 2011, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that Osment had joined the cast of &quot;Sassy Pants&quot;, a comedy about a homeschooler with an overbearing mother.

&quot;Variety&quot; reported on June 27, 2011, that Osment would star in &quot;Wake the Dead&quot;, a modern-day retelling of the Frankenstein story, with production to begin the last quarter of 2011. As of mid-2014, no published status was available.

In 2013, he appeared in a series of episodes of Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Alpha House&quot;. He also co-starred in the Will Ferrell and Adam McKay-produced comedy melodrama miniseries &quot;The Spoils of Babylon&quot; and &quot;The Spoils Before Dying&quot; for IFC. Kevin Smith has further added to Osment&#x27;s career resurgence with roles in the first two films of his True North Trilogy, first as Teddy Craft in &quot;Tusk&quot; and next as a fictionalized version of Canadian journalist Adrien Arcand in &quot;Yoga Hosers&quot;.

In 2015, Osment appeared in &quot;Entourage&quot;, the film adaptation of the &quot;television series&quot;. The following year, he appeared in the drama film &quot;Almost Friends&quot;.

In 2017, Osment held a recurring role in season 4 of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; as VR expert and tech financier Keenan Feldspar. Also in 2017, Osment made an appearance on BBC America&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear America&quot; as one of the guests in the fourth episode of season 1. He then appeared in the comedy films &quot;Izzy Gets the F*ck Across Town&quot; (2017) and &quot;Clara&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (2018)

In 2019, Osment had a supporting role in the Netflix film &quot;Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile&quot;, starring alongside Lily Collins whose character Liz follows the prosecution of Ted Bundy, played by Zac Efron. In 2023, he was in the Amazon Prime film &quot;Somebody I Used to Know&quot;. Osment performs in two series that have Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg as executive producers: Osment plays Mesmer in the Amazon series &quot;The Boys&quot; and Dr. Stu Camillo in the Hulu series &quot;Future Man&quot;.

His voice roles include Kash D.
