<doc id="277176" wikidata="Q332706" url="?curid=277176" title="Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham">
<text>Douglas McGarel Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham, (28 February 1872 – 16 August 1950) was a British lawyer and Conservative politician who twice served as Lord Chancellor, in addition to a number of other Cabinet positions. Mooted as a possible successor to Stanley Baldwin as party leader for a time in the very early 1930s, he was widely considered to be one of the leading Conservative politicians of his generation.

==Early life==
Born in London, Hogg was the son of the merchant and philanthropist Quintin Hogg and of Alice Anna Hogg, &quot;née&quot; Graham (d. 1918). Both of his grandfathers, Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet, and William Graham, were Members of Parliament. He was educated at Cheam School and Eton College, before spending eight years working for the family firm of sugar merchants, spending time in the West Indies and British Guiana. During the Boer War he served with the 19th (Berwick and Lothian) Yeomanry, and was wounded in action and decorated.

==Legal career==
Returning from South Africa, he was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1902. Despite starting at the bar relatively late in life, as a junior barrister, he built up a large practice in both common law and commercial law. His son later believed that Hogg was earning £14,000 per annum (around £1.4m at 2018 prices) by 1914.

Sir John Simon later wrote of him: &quot;Hogg had all the qualities that go to make a leader at the bar: an accurate grasp of complicated facts, a clear view of the principles of law which had to be applied to them, a sturdy attitude in the face of the situation with which he had to deal, and a manner which was genial and conciliatory with a persuasive force behind it well calculated to win assent from the tribunal he was addressing. He was never at a loss, and no counsel was more adept at preparing the way to meet the difficulties of the case.&quot;

He was appointed King&#x27;s Counsel in 1917, and became a bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and Attorney-General to the Prince of Wales in 1920.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1903 he also devoted considerable time to the Royal Polytechnic institution, which his father had founded.

== Political background ==
Hogg began to be involved in Conservative politics while still at the bar. He was involved in the Conservatives&#x27; legal attacks against the Liberals during the Marconi scandal.

Hogg&#x27;s son Quintin later recalled that, probably around the time of the Curragh Incident in March 1914 when he was six years old, he had been presented to the adults at the close of a tea party, and had asked &quot;Who is Winston Churchill?&quot; Churchill, a leading member of the Liberal Cabinet at the time, was one of those apparently threatening some kind of military and naval action against Protestant Ulster; Hogg&#x27;s brother Ian was then serving with the 4th Hussars at the Curragh. Hogg replied that he had always told his son that it was wicked to wish somebody dead (he had, Quintin recorded, never actually told him any such thing) but that if he did wish anyone dead it would be Winston Churchill. Hogg later claimed not to recollect the occasion, when his son reminded him of it in the 1920s; he and Churchill were (Conservative) Cabinet colleagues by then. On the outbreak of war in August 1914 Hogg was cheered by bystanders in a London park, who mistook him for Churchill, to whom he bore a slight physical resemblance.

Hogg was approached to be the Conservative Party candidate for Marylebone, but stood down before the 1918 election rather than fight the sitting member (Sir Samuel Scott) for the nomination.

== Attorney-General: 1922–1924 ==
The Lloyd George Coalition (Conservative-Liberal) collapsed as a result of the Carlton Club meeting in October 1922. Bonar Law formed a purely Conservative government but found himself short of law officers after many leading members of the Coalition refused to serve. Hogg, not yet an MP, was appointed Attorney General.

Harold Macmillan, who was not yet an MP, records the following exchange between the Earl of Derby and Duke of Devonshire (Macmillan&#x27;s father-in-law):&#x27;Ah,&#x27; said Lord Derby, &#x27;you are too pessimistic. They have found a wonderful little man. One of those attorney fellows, you know. He will do all the work.&#x27; &#x27;What&#x27;s his name?&#x27;, said the Duke. &#x27;Pig,&#x27; said Lord Derby. Turning to me, the Duke replied, &#x27;Do you know Pig? I know James Pigg [he was a great reader of Surtees]. I don&#x27;t know any other Pig.&#x27; It turned out to be Sir Douglas Hogg! This was a truly Trollopian scene.

Bonar Law arranged for Hogg to be selected as Conservative candidate for the safe seat of St Marylebone. He was returned unopposed to the House of Commons in the November 1922 general election, at which Law&#x27;s government won a comfortable majority.

Hogg therefore began his Commons career on the front bench, and within days had to help pilot through the House the bill which set up the Irish Free State constitution. Within four weeks of entering office he also had to assist Lord Chancellor Cave and Neville Chamberlain (Minister of Health) to write a reply from Baldwin (Chancellor of the Exchequer) to a delegation of the unemployed. Though not yet a full member of the Cabinet, he was sworn of the Privy Council and received the (then) customary knighthood (in December 1922). Hogg continued as Attorney-General when Stanley Baldwin became prime minister for the first time in May 1923.

Hogg spent much of this time at his country home in Sussex, where he had become a prominent county figure. He was a justice of the peace for the county from 1923. Even when he later became Lord Chancellor he sometimes continued to sit as an ordinary magistrate at Lewes.

The Conservatives lost their majority in the December 1923 election, which returned a hung Parliament. Hogg continued as Attorney General until the first Labour government, under Ramsay MacDonald, took office in January 1924.

Hogg maintained an active Commons role in opposition. Neville Chamberlain wrote that Hogg&#x27;s speech during the debate which installed MacDonald &quot;made a great impression and heartened up our party immensely&quot;. The same was true in the debate on the Campbell Case in October 1924, which brought down MacDonald&#x27;s government. This time Chamberlain wrote that &quot;Hogg&#x27;s summing up was a real tour-de-force. Until then I confess to having been rattled by the special pleading on the other side and only when I heard Hogg did I realise how strong the case against the Govt still remained.&quot;

== Baldwin&#x27;s second government: 1924–1929 ==
=== Attorney-General again ===
Later in October 1924, Hogg was reappointed Attorney-General, this time with a seat in the Cabinet, when the Conservatives were returned to power. Although Hogg played a full part in cabinet debates, his main responsibility was to advise the government on legal matters, and other ministers seem to have regarded him mainly as a lawyer–politician. He was the minister responsible for the arrest and prosecution of Harry Pollitt and a number of other British communists for subversion in October 1925, though credit was generally attributed to the better-known Home Secretary, William Joynson-Hicks. Hogg also gave legal advice over the general strike of 1926.

Hogg was popular among his colleagues, and despite his fierceness in debate he was not particularly disliked by his opponents. Neville Chamberlain wrote in 1926 that he was &#x27;one of the best, straight and loyal and possessed of a wonderful brain. Moreover, he is a first-class fighting man&#x27; (Diary Letters, 338).

The Miners&#x27; Strike (technically a lockout) had continued after the General Strike, but had ended with large-scale unemployment while those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, lower wages, and district (rather than national) wage agreements. As Attorney-General, Hogg guided the Trade Disputes Act of 1927 through the House of Commons. This made mass picketing and secondary strikes (i.e. strikes by other unions who were not party to the dispute in hand) illegal and directed that union members had to &quot;contract in&quot; any political levy (i.e. members had to actively choose if they wished to make a donation to the Labour Party alongside their subscription). It also forbade civil service unions from affiliating with the Trades Union Congress.

Over the course of the government, Hogg began to be tipped as a future Home Secretary and perhaps even prime minister. In 1928 Austen Chamberlain wrote to one of his sisters about knotty legal issues that he faced at the Foreign Office, over which Hailsham &#x27;was unable to help me to a decision, which if you knew him would alone be sufficient to show you how extremely difficult of solution these problems are&#x27;.

=== First term as Lord Chancellor ===
Viscount Cave retired as Lord Chancellor early in 1928. Hogg was offered the job but did not want to accept, on the grounds that it &quot;barred any chance of the premiership&quot; and appealed to Neville Chamberlain for help (26 March 1928) on the grounds that he did not want to see &quot;W. Churchill&quot; become prime minister after Baldwin. Chamberlain agreed, and felt that Churchill and his friend Lord Birkenhead were more likely to agree to serve in a future Hogg government than under Chamberlain (both Hogg and Chamberlain protested unconvincingly to one another that they did not particularly want to be prime minister). However, Baldwin insisted that Hogg accept the promotion. Besides his own reluctance to accept, he was also aware that a peerage might also inhibit the political ambitions of his elder son, Quintin Hogg, who was already active in student politics at Oxford University—as indeed it did.

On 29 March 1928, Hogg became Lord Chancellor, and on 5 April he was created Baron Hailsham, of Hailsham in the County of Sussex.

As the parliament ended in May 1929, Austen Chamberlain wrote that Hailsham&#x27;s judgement was &#x27;I think as good as that of any member of the Cabinet&#x27; (Diary Letters, 322, 330). He held the Great Seal for just over a year until the government&#x27;s unexpected defeat in the 1929 election. In that year&#x27;s Birthday Honours (3 June) he was promoted to Viscount Hailsham, of Hailsham in the County of Sussex.

== Opposition: 1929–1931 ==
Between 1929 and 1931, Hailsham was Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. He did not give strong support to Baldwin when the latter&#x27;s leadership was attacked, and apparently did nothing to quash speculation that he might become leader himself. The former party whip Lord Bayford thought in March 1931 that &#x27;the only possible suggestion made at present is that Hailsham should lead the party and Neville [Chamberlain] be leader in the Commons&#x27; (&quot;Real Old Tory Politics&quot;, p245).

As a former Lord Chancellor Hailsham continued to sit as a Law Lord. Sir John Simon identified a number of significant cases in the Lords in which his judgments &#x27;illustrated his power of lucid reasoning and his command of appropriate language&#x27;: &quot;Addie &quot;v.&quot; Dumbreck&quot; (injury to child trespasser, 1929); &quot;Tolley &quot;v.&quot; Fry&quot; (defamation, 1931); &quot;Swadling &quot;v.&quot; Cooper&quot; (contributory negligence, 1931).

Hailsham became president of Sussex County cricket club in 1931.

== Secretary of State for War: 1931–1935 ==
Hailsham was not offered a seat in the small emergency Cabinet of the National Government of August–October 1931, a fact which John Ramsden attributes to his disloyalty to Baldwin in opposition. Hailsham&#x27;s previous job was not available, as the Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Sankey had joined the National Government; Hailsham was therefore offered, and refused, the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal. After the October 1931 elections, with the Cabinet restored to a larger size, he joined the second National Government as Secretary of State for War and Leader of the House of Lords.

Hailsham was a strong supporter of protectionism (tariffs on goods imported into the British Empire, an aspiration for many Conservatives since Joseph Chamberlain had called for them in 1903). However, he suggested that the Cabinet &quot;agree to differ&quot; on the issue, so that the Conservatives could press on with plans for tariffs, while remaining in coalition with Liberals and National Labour; the free traders left the coalition once tariff plans had been agreed internationally. Hailsham was one of the ministers representing the National Government at the Ottawa Imperial Economic Conference in 1932. At Ottawa, Baldwin told his friend Tom Jones, &quot;the bulk of the negotiations have been done by Neville [Chamberlain], &#x27;ably assisted&#x27; (as the papers would say) by Hailsham&quot;, but Baldwin also wryly admitted that he had let those two do the work &quot;because if they failed the Die-Hards at home would know it was not from half-hearted trying&quot; (Jones, 49–50).

Hailsham served as President of the MCC in 1933. He was an important contributor to the diplomacy involved following the Bodyline Series problems of 1932–33 during the English Cricket tour of Australia under the captaincy of Douglas Jardine His presidency of the MCC in 1933 combined an interest in cricket with his earlier constituency connection with Marylebone.

Hailsham was also leader of the House of Lords from 1931 to 1935; in 1934–5 he had to handle Lord Salisbury&#x27;s attacks on the government&#x27;s plans to bring in greater Indian self-government. Hailsham was no longer as well-regarded in the Conservative party in the mid-1930s as ten years earlier.

As Secretary of State for War, Hailsham was popular with senior army officers. However, although he presided over the army&#x27;s first serious rearmament plans, spending priority in 1934-5 was given to the Royal Air Force, and to a lesser extent the Royal Navy.

== Second term as Lord Chancellor: 1935–1938 ==
On 7 June 1935, to his apparent pleasure, Hailsham returned to the Lord Chancellorship under Stanley Baldwin, now prime minister for the third time. In December 1935 Hailsham had to preside over the last trial of a peer &#x27;by his peers&#x27;, when he was appointed Lord High Steward to conduct the trial of the 26th Baron de Clifford in the House of Lords for manslaughter. He ruled that there was no case for Lord de Clifford to answer, but also suggested that this mediaeval privilege was obsolete; the procedure was abolished in the Criminal Justice Act 1948. Hailsham earned plaudits both for presiding over House of Lords debates, and for leading the Law Lords. He was awarded honorary doctorates of letters or civil law by the universities of Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Oxford, and Reading.

Although he was only in his mid sixties, Hailsham&#x27;s health was already beginning to fail by 1936. He initially continued as Lord Chancellor under Baldwin&#x27;s successor Neville Chamberlain from May 1937, but in March 1938 he transferred to the sinecure post of Lord President of the Council. In 1938 Hailsham suffered a serious stroke, which disabled his right side. He later learned to write with his left hand, but although his mind was clear he could no longer speak clearly. He had to retire from the government altogether on 31 October 1938, four days after his elder son Quintin had been elected to the Commons at a by-election. A &quot;Punch&quot; cartoon showed Hailsham as a cricketer heading back to the pavilion as his son came out to bat.

== Later life ==
On 14 October 1940, Hailsham was having dinner at the Carlton Club with his son Quintin, who was about to depart for active service as an army officer in North Africa. The club was hit by a bomb, and observers, including the diarist Harold Nicolson, likened the sight of Quintin carrying his disabled father from the building to Aeneas carrying his father Anchises on his back from the sack of Troy (the event, and the classical allusion, are also mentioned in Churchill&#x27;s &quot;History of the Second World War&quot;).

Ill health prevented Hailsham from playing an active role in the House of Lords as a private member, though he continued to be as active as he could in such outside bodies as the Inns of Court regiment (honorary colonel, 1935–48) and the British Empire Cancer Campaign (chairman, 1936–50).

Hailsham died at his home in Hailsham, East Sussex, (which he had bought in 1917 after taking silk), on 16 August 1950, aged 78. He was buried in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27;, Herstmonceux. The title passed to his son Quintin. His estate was valued for probate at £225,032 18s. 2d (around £7m at 2018 prices).

== Assessments ==
John Ramsden suggests that rapid success, coming to a man who entered politics at the late age of fifty, made him &quot;overplay his hand&quot; in the events of 1929–31, even though as a peer by then he could not reasonably hope to be prime minister. William Bridgeman recorded in his diary that Hogg&#x27;s success had not impaired &quot;his great ability in debate, though it did I think interfere with his political judgement … He never suffered a reverse until the defeat of the party in 1929, an experience which would have been beneficial if he had had it.&quot;

The diarist Chips Channon thought that Hailsham looked like Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s lord chancellor in his robes, but, as Lord Denning later recalled, if he &#x27;looked like Mr. Pickwick&#x27;, he also &#x27;spoke like Demosthenes&#x27;.

==Family==
On 14 August 1905, Hogg married Elizabeth Marjoribanks, daughter of James Trimble Brown, an American judge from Tennessee. She was the widow of his cousin, the Hon. Archibald Marjoribanks (son of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth).

Hogg acquired two stepchildren from Elizabeth&#x27;s previous marriage. One of these was Edward Marjoribanks (born 1900), who became a Conservative MP in 1929 but committed suicide in 1932.

Hogg and his wife had two sons:

* Quintin McGarel Hogg, 2nd Viscount Hailsham, later Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone (born 9 October 1907, died 12 October 2001), barrister and politician, who disclaimed the viscountcy, but was later given a life peerage and himself became Lord Chancellor.
* Hon William Neil McGarel Hogg (born 1910, died 13 February 1995), diplomat.

Elizabeth suffered a stroke in 1923, and died in May 1925, shortly after they had visited the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park together. Her poor health had brought them closer together, and Hogg felt that they had become like newlyweds again. Quintin, then aged seventeen, had to answer many of the condolence letters himself, and later recorded that for four years afterwards he could hear his father in his bedroom at night &quot;literally shouting with agony&quot;.

On 3 January 1929, Lord Hailsham, as he now was, married a second time, to Mildred Margaret (d. 1964), daughter of Edward Parker Dew and widow of Alfred Clive Lawrence. They had no children.

<text>Mellieħa ( ) is a large village in the Northern Region of Malta. It has a population of 10,087 as of March 2014. Mellieħa is also a tourist resort, popular for its sandy beaches, natural environment, and Popeye Village nearby.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Mellieħa&quot; is derived from the Semitic root &quot;m-l-ħ&quot;, which means &quot;salt&quot;. This is probably derived from the ancient Punic-Roman salt pans which existed at Mellieħa Bay. The site of the salt pans is now occupied by the Għadira Nature Reserve.

==History==

===Prehistory to Middle Ages===
Mellieħa was first inhabited in around 3000 BC, during the Neolithic period. Several megalithic remains have been found, including the temple of Għajn Żejtuna, as well as several caves and tombs, in which tools and pottery fragments were found.

During the Roman period, troglodytes began to live in the caves of Mellieħa&#x27;s valleys. The cave settlements continued to exist during Byzantine rule, but were abandoned in the early medieval period.

According to the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul was shipwrecked in Malta in around 60 AD, possibly in the nearby St. Paul&#x27;s Bay. According to local tradition, St. Luke, who was accompanying St. Paul, came across one of Mellieħa&#x27;s caves and painted the figure of Our Lady on the rock face. In 409 AD, the cave was consecrated as a church, and it is now known as the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieħa.

Mellieħa was one of the first ten parishes of Malta. It still existed in 1436, but was abandoned soon afterwards in the late 15th or early 16th century, since the north of Malta was no longer safe due to raids by Muslim corsairs.

===Under the Order of Saint John===

Malta was one of the first regions that Muslims entered in the Mediterranean, and this is evident in the Islamic heritage of buildings and ancient relics of mosques and homes. In addition to that the Arabic language that has remained rooted in the language of the current people of the island, this was starting from year 826 A.D. and lasted for 220 years.

During the early years of Hospitaller rule in Malta, Mellieħa remained abandoned. In the late 16th century, the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieħa was rebuilt.

The northern coast of Malta began to be fortified in the early 17th century. The first fortification to be built in Mellieħa was Saint Agatha&#x27;s Tower, which was completed in 1649. This large tower was built on Marfa Ridge, overlooking Mellieħa Bay, with clear views of Comino and Gozo. The smaller Għajn Ħadid Tower and Armier Tower were also built in the limits of Mellieħa in 1658.

A series of coastal batteries, redoubts and entrenchments were also built in Mellieħa in the 18th century. Several of these still survive, such as Mistra Battery, Vendôme Battery, Wied Musa Battery and Westreme Battery. The Devil&#x27;s Farmhouse found at Ta&#x27; Randa area is an example of Maltese farmhouses built in the 18th century.

===British period to present day===
Mellieħa, as it is today, developed whilst Malta was under British rule. The village became a parish once again in 1844, and began to develop after the British encouraged people to settle in the area by giving leases to the population. The parish church was built in various stages in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and it is said that the locals helped in building the church. A postal agency opened in Mellieħa in 1891.

Just before World War II, Fort Campbell was built in Selmun, whilst Mellieħa Fort was built on top of Mellieħa Hill as a lookout post. The British also built a number of pillboxes around the coastline of Mellieħa, for defensive purposes in case of an Italian or German invasion.

Mellieħa has seen a lot of development since the end of the war. The Mellieħa Local Council was established by the Local Councils Act of 1993.

==Geography==
The town of Mellieħa stands on a group of hills on the northwest coast of the main island. Mellieħa proper consists of the areas of Mellieħa Heights, Santa Maria Estate, il-Qortin, Ta&#x27; Pennellu, Ta&#x27; Masrija and Tal-Ibraġ. The nearby villages of Manikata and Selmun also fall under Mellieħa&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The town overlooks Mellieħa Bay, which includes Għadira Bay, the largest sandy beach in Malta. To the east of the town and bay, there is the Selmun peninsula, and St Paul&#x27;s Islands lie about 80 metres off the coast. Mistra Bay lies close to Selmun, and this marks the boundary between Mellieħa and St. Paul&#x27;s Bay.

The large Marfa Peninsula lies to the north of Mellieħa. It includes several small bays, such as Armier Bay and Paradise Bay, as well as the harbour of Ċirkewwa, from which the Gozo ferry departs. The Marfa Ridge spans across a large part of the peninsula.

To the south of Marfa Ridge, there are Anchor Bay and Popeye Village, Majjistral Nature and History Park, the hamlet of Manikata and Golden Bay. The boundary with Mġarr lies at Għajn Tuffieħa.

==Tourism==
Mellieħa is a popular tourist destination during the summer months. It is well known for its beaches, with the most well known being Għadira Bay and Golden Bay. Ċirkewwa is also popular as a dive site, and includes the wrecks of MV &quot;Rozi&quot; and the P29 patrol boat.

In 2009, Mellieħa was awarded the title of European Destination of Excellence due to its sustainable initiatives.
Sailing is also a major drive for tourisum with the Euromed championships taking place between the 19th and the 22nd of December from the beach by the &quot;Munchies&quot; restaurant. It has both ILCA and Optimist dinghys racing and has been held every year since 2000.

<text>Colin Riley McMillan (July 27, 1935 – July 24, 2003) was a United States Assistant Secretary of Defense under President George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War. He was awaiting confirmation as United States Secretary of the Navy in 2003 when he died from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound in the head at his New Mexico ranch.

McMillan was the chairman and CEO of Permian Exploration Corporation, an oil exploration company, the chairman of the First Federal Savings Bank in Roswell, New Mexico, and the founder and CEO of McMillan Production Company. He was appointed in 2001 to be the chairman of the Sallie Mae Corporation by President George W. Bush.

McMillan earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in geology from the University of North Carolina in 1957. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1957 to 1960 and in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1960 to 1972, attaining the rank of major.

McMillan served in the New Mexico House of Representatives from 1971 to 1982. He ran for the United States Senate seat in New Mexico in 1994 but lost to incumbent Democrat Jeff Bingaman by a 54% to 46% margin. In 2000, McMillan was the New Mexico state chairman of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign.

McMillan was survived by his wife, Kay, four children, and eight grandchildren.

<text>In the mathematical field of representation theory, a weight of an algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field F is an algebra homomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to F, or equivalently, a one-dimensional representation of &quot;A&quot; over F. It is the algebra analogue of a multiplicative character of a group. The importance of the concept, however, stems from its application to representations of Lie algebras and hence also to representations of algebraic and Lie groups. In this context, a weight of a representation is a generalization of the notion of an eigenvalue, and the corresponding eigenspace is called a weight space.

==Motivation and general concept==

Given a set &quot;S&quot; of formula_1 matrices over the same field, each of which is diagonalizable, and any two of which commute, it is always possible to simultaneously diagonalize all of the elements of &quot;S&quot;. Equivalently, for any set &quot;S&quot; of mutually commuting semisimple linear transformations of a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; there exists a basis of &quot;V&quot; consisting of &quot;simultaneous eigenvectors&quot; of all elements of &quot;S&quot;. Each of these common eigenvectors &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; defines a linear functional on the subalgebra &quot;U&quot; of End(&quot;V&quot; ) generated by the set of endomorphisms &quot;S&quot;; this functional is defined as the map which associates to each element of &quot;U&quot; its eigenvalue on the eigenvector &quot;v&quot;. This map is also multiplicative, and sends the identity to 1; thus it is an algebra homomorphism from &quot;U&quot; to the base field. This &quot;generalized eigenvalue&quot; is a prototype for the notion of a weight.

The notion is closely related to the idea of a multiplicative character in group theory, which is a homomorphism &quot;χ&quot; from a group &quot;G&quot; to the multiplicative group of a field F. Thus &quot;χ&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → F× satisfies &quot;χ&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) = 1 (where &quot;e&quot; is the identity element of &quot;G&quot;) and
:formula_2 for all &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.
Indeed, if &quot;G&quot; acts on a vector space &quot;V&quot; over F, each simultaneous eigenspace for every element of &quot;G&quot;, if such exists, determines a multiplicative character on &quot;G&quot;: the eigenvalue on this common eigenspace of each element of the group.

The notion of multiplicative character can be extended to any algebra &quot;A&quot; over F, by replacing &quot;χ&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → F× by a linear map &quot;χ&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → F with:
:formula_3 
for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. If an algebra &quot;A&quot; acts on a vector space &quot;V&quot; over F to any simultaneous eigenspace, this corresponds an algebra homomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to F assigning to each element of &quot;A&quot; its eigenvalue.

If &quot;A&quot; is a Lie algebra (which is generally not an associative algebra), then instead of requiring multiplicativity of a character, one requires that it maps any Lie bracket to the corresponding commutator; but since F is commutative this simply means that this map must vanish on Lie brackets: &quot;χ&quot;([&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]) = 0. A weight on a Lie algebra g over a field F is a linear map λ: g → F with λ([&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;]) = 0 for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in g. Any weight on a Lie algebra g vanishes on the derived algebra [g,g] and hence descends to a weight on the abelian Lie algebra g/[g,g]. Thus weights are primarily of interest for abelian Lie algebras, where they reduce to the simple notion of a generalized eigenvalue for space of commuting linear transformations.

If &quot;G&quot; is a Lie group or an algebraic group, then a multiplicative character θ: &quot;G&quot; → F× induces a weight &quot;χ&quot; = dθ: g → F on its Lie algebra by differentiation. (For Lie groups, this is differentiation at the identity element of &quot;G&quot;, and the algebraic group case is an abstraction using the notion of a derivation.)

==Weights in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras==

Let formula_4 be a complex semisimple Lie algebra and formula_5 a Cartan subalgebra of formula_4. In this section, we describe the concepts needed to formulate the &quot;theorem of the highest weight&quot; classifying the finite-dimensional representations of formula_4. Notably, we will explain the notion of a &quot;dominant integral element.&quot; The representations themselves are described in the article linked to above.

===Weight of a representation===

Let formula_8 be a representation of a Lie algebra formula_4 on a vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field of characteristic 0, say formula_10, and let formula_11 be a linear functional on formula_5, where formula_5 is a Cartan subalgebra of formula_4. Then the of &quot;V&quot; with weight &quot;λ&quot; is the subspace formula_15 given by
:formula_16.
A weight of the representation &quot;V&quot; (the representation is often referred to in short by the vector space &quot;V&quot; over which elements of the Lie algebra act rather than the map formula_17) is a linear functional λ such that the corresponding weight space is nonzero. Nonzero elements of the weight space are called weight vectors. That is to say, a weight vector is a simultaneous eigenvector for the action of the elements of formula_5, with the corresponding eigenvalues given by λ.

If &quot;V&quot; is the direct sum of its weight spaces
:formula_19
then &quot;V&quot; is called a &quot;;&quot; this corresponds to there being a common eigenbasis (a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors) for all the represented elements of the algebra, i.e., to there being simultaneously diagonalizable matrices (see diagonalizable matrix).

If &quot;G&quot; is group with Lie algebra formula_4, every finite-dimensional representation of &quot;G&quot; induces a representation of formula_4. A weight of the representation of &quot;G&quot; is then simply a weight of the associated representation of formula_4. There is a subtle distinction between weights of group representations and Lie algebra representations, which is that there is a different notion of integrality condition in the two cases; see below. (The integrality condition is more restrictive in the group case, reflecting that not every representation of the Lie algebra comes from a representation of the group.)

===Action of the root vectors===
For the adjoint representation formula_23 of formula_4, the space over which the representation acts is the Lie algebra itself. Then the nonzero weights are called roots, the weight spaces are called root spaces, and the weight vectors, which are thus elements of formula_25, are called root vectors. Explicitly, a linear functional formula_26 on the Cartan subalgebra formula_5 is called a root if formula_28 and there exists a nonzero formula_29 in formula_4 such that
:formula_31
for all formula_32 in formula_5. The collection of roots forms a root system.

From the perspective of representation theory, the significance of the roots and root vectors is the following elementary but important result: If formula_8 is a representation of formula_4, &quot;v&quot; is a weight vector with weight formula_36 and &quot;X&quot; is a root vector with root formula_26, then
: formula_38
for all &quot;H&quot; in formula_5. That is, formula_40 is either the zero vector or a weight vector with weight formula_41. Thus, the action of formula_29 maps the weight space with weight formula_36 into the weight space with weight formula_41.

For example, if formula_45, or formula_46 complexified, the root vectors formula_47 span the algebra and have weights formula_48, formula_49, and formula_50 respectively. The Cartan subalgebra is spanned by formula_32, and the action of formula_32 classifies the weight spaces. The action of formula_29 maps a weight space of weight formula_36 to the weight space of weight formula_55 and the action of formula_56 maps a weight space of weight formula_36 to the weight space of weight formula_58, and the action of formula_32 maps the weight spaces to themselves. In the fundamental representation, with weights formula_60 and weight spaces formula_61, formula_29 maps formula_63 to zero and formula_64 to formula_63, while formula_56 maps formula_64 to zero and formula_63 to formula_64, and formula_32 maps each weight space to itself.

===Integral element===

Let formula_71 be the real subspace of formula_72 generated by the roots of formula_4, where formula_74 is the space of linear functionals formula_75, the dual space to formula_5. For computations, it is convenient to choose an inner product that is invariant under the Weyl group, that is, under reflections about the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots. We may then use this inner product to identify formula_71 with a subspace formula_78 of formula_5. With this identification, the coroot associated to a root formula_26 is given as 
:formula_81
where formula_82 denotes the inner product of vectors formula_83 In addition to this inner product, it is common for an angle bracket notation formula_84 to be used in discussions of root systems, with the angle bracket defined as formula_85 The angle bracket here is not an inner product, as it is not symmetric, and is linear only in the first argument. The angle bracket notation should not be confused with the inner product formula_86 

We now define two different notions of integrality for elements of formula_78. The motivation for these definitions is simple: The weights of finite-dimensional representations of formula_4 satisfy the first integrality condition, while if &quot;G&quot; is a group with Lie algebra formula_4, the weights of finite-dimensional representations of &quot;G&quot; satisfy the second integrality condition.

An element formula_90 is algebraically integral if
:formula_91
for all roots formula_26. The motivation for this condition is that the coroot formula_93 can be identified with the &quot;H&quot; element in a standard formula_94 basis for an formula_95-subalgebra of formula_4. By elementary results for formula_95, the eigenvalues of formula_93 in any finite-dimensional representation must be an integer. We conclude that, as stated above, the weight of any finite-dimensional representation of formula_4 is algebraically integral.

The fundamental weights formula_100 are defined by the property that they form a basis of formula_78 dual to the set of coroots associated to the simple roots. That is, the fundamental weights are defined by the condition
:formula_102
where formula_103 are the simple roots. An element formula_36 is then algebraically integral if and only if it is an integral combination of the fundamental weights. The set of all formula_4-integral weights is a lattice in formula_78 called the &quot;weight lattice&quot; for formula_4, denoted by formula_108.

The figure shows the example of the Lie algebra formula_109, whose root system is the formula_110 root system. There are two simple roots, formula_111 and formula_112. The first fundamental weight, formula_113, should be orthogonal to formula_112 and should project orthogonally to half of formula_111, and similarly for formula_116. The weight lattice is then the triangular lattice.

Suppose now that the Lie algebra formula_4 is the Lie algebra of a Lie group &quot;G&quot;. Then we say that formula_90 is analytically integral (&quot;G-integral&quot;) if for each &quot;t&quot; in formula_5 such that formula_120 we have formula_121. The reason for making this definition is that if a representation of formula_4 arises from a representation of &quot;G&quot;, then the weights of the representation will be &quot;G&quot;-integral. For &quot;G&quot; semisimple, the set of all &quot;G&quot;-integral weights is a sublattice &quot;P&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) ⊂ &quot;P&quot;(formula_4). If &quot;G&quot; is simply connected, then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) = &quot;P&quot;(formula_4). If &quot;G&quot; is not simply connected, then the lattice &quot;P&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is smaller than &quot;P&quot;(formula_4) and their quotient is isomorphic to the fundamental group of &quot;G&quot;.

===Partial ordering on the space of weights===

We now introduce a partial ordering on the set of weights, which will be used to formulate the theorem of the highest weight describing the representations of formula_4. Recall that &quot;R&quot; is the set of roots; we now fix a set formula_127 of positive roots.

Consider two elements formula_128 and formula_36 of formula_78. We are mainly interested in the case where formula_128 and formula_36 are integral, but this assumption is not necessary to the definition we are about to introduce. We then say that formula_128 is higher than formula_36, which we write as formula_135, if formula_136 is expressible as a linear combination of positive roots with non-negative real coefficients. This means, roughly, that &quot;higher&quot; means in the directions of the positive roots. We equivalently say that formula_36 is &quot;lower&quot; than formula_128, which we write as formula_139.

This is only a &quot;partial&quot; ordering; it can easily happen that formula_128 is neither higher nor lower than formula_36.

===Dominant weight===
An integral element λ is &quot;dominant&quot; if formula_142 for each positive root &quot;γ&quot;. Equivalently, λ is dominant if it is a &quot;non-negative&quot; integer combination of the fundamental weights. In the formula_110 case, the dominant integral elements live in a 60-degree sector. The notion of being dominant is not the same as being higher than zero. Note the grey area in the picture on the right is a 120-degree sector, strictly containing the 60-degree sector corresponding to the dominant integral elements.

The set of all λ (not necessarily integral) such that formula_142 is known as the &quot;fundamental Weyl chamber&quot; associated to the given set of positive roots.

===Theorem of the highest weight===

A weight formula_36 of a representation formula_146 of formula_4 is called a highest weight if every other weight of formula_146 is lower than formula_36.

The theory classifying the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of formula_4 is by means of a &quot;theorem of the highest weight.&quot; The theorem says that
:(1) every irreducible (finite-dimensional) representation has a highest weight, 
:(2) the highest weight is always a dominant, algebraically integral element, 
:(3) two irreducible representations with the same highest weight are isomorphic, and 
:(4) every dominant, algebraically integral element is the highest weight of an irreducible representation. 
The last point is the most difficult one; the representations may be constructed using Verma modules.

===Highest-weight module===
A representation (not necessarily finite dimensional) &quot;V&quot; of formula_4 is called &quot;highest-weight module&quot; if it is generated by a weight vector &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; that is annihilated by the action of all positive root spaces in formula_4. Every irreducible formula_4-module with a highest weight is necessarily a highest-weight module, but in the infinite-dimensional case, a highest weight module need not be irreducible. 
For each formula_154—not necessarily dominant or integral—there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) simple highest-weight formula_4-module with highest weight λ, which is denoted &quot;L&quot;(λ), but this module is infinite dimensional unless λ is dominant integral. It can be shown that each highest weight module with highest weight λ is a quotient of the Verma module &quot;M&quot;(λ). This is just a restatement of &quot;universality property&quot; in the definition of a Verma module.

Every &quot;finite-dimensional&quot; highest weight module is irreducible.

<text>The phonology of the open back vowels of the English language has undergone changes both overall and with regional variations, through Old and Middle English to the present. The sounds heard in modern English were significantly influenced by the Great Vowel Shift, as well as more recent developments in some dialects such as the &quot;cot–caught&quot; merger.

==Overview==
===Old and Middle English===
In the Old English vowel system, the vowels in the open back area were unrounded: . There were also rounded back vowels of mid-height: . The corresponding spellings were and , with the length distinctions not normally marked; in modern editions of Old English texts, the long vowels are often written , .

As the Old English (OE) system developed into that of Middle English (ME), the OE short vowel merged with the fronted to become a more central ME . Meanwhile, the OE long vowel was rounded and raised to ME . OE short remained relatively unchanged, becoming a short ME vowel regarded as , while OE long became ME (a higher vowel than ). Alternative developments were also possible; see English historical vowel correspondences for details.

Later, ME open syllable lengthening caused the short vowel to be normally changed to in open syllables. Remaining instances of the short vowel also tended to become lower. Hence in Late Middle English (around 1400) the following open back vowels were present, distinguished by length:
* , spelt , as in &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;god&quot;
* , often spelt , or before consonant+vowel or certain consonant pairs, as in &quot;boat&quot;, &quot;whole&quot;, &quot;old&quot;

===16th-century changes===
By 1600, the following changes had occurred:
* The long vowel of &quot;boat&quot; had been raised to as a result of the Great Vowel Shift.
* The diphthong found in words such as &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;law&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;, &quot;psalm&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, &quot;chamber&quot;, &quot;dance&quot; had become an open back monophthong or .
* At this time, the short in &quot;dog&quot; was lowered to 

There were thus two open back monophthongs: 
* as in &quot;lot&quot;
* or as in &quot;cause&quot;

and one open back diphthong: 
* as in &quot;low&quot;

===17th-century changes===
By 1700, the following further developments had taken place:
* The diphthong of &quot;soul&quot; was raised to , and then monophthongized to , merging with &quot;boat&quot; (see &quot;toe–tow&quot; merger). Before , this vowel further merged with due to the horse–hoarse merger except in some varieties, as currently seen in Irish English, Scottish English and African American Vernacular English.
* Short was retracted and rounded to . The shift was suppressed before a velar consonant, as in &quot;quack&quot;, &quot;twang&quot;, &quot;wag&quot;, &quot;wax&quot;, and also was suppressed by analogy in &quot;swam&quot; (the irregular past tense of &quot;swim&quot;). The change of to did not occur in Mid-Ulster English.
* had begun to partake in lengthening and raising before a nonprevocalic voiceless fricative or /r/. That resulted in words like &quot;broth&quot;, &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;off&quot; having instead of , and was the start of the split (see further below).
* In words such as &quot;change&quot; and &quot;chamber&quot;, the pronunciation was gradually replaced in the standard language by a variant with , derived from Middle English . That explains the contemporary pronunciation of these words with .
* However, when preceded , as in &quot;laugh&quot; and &quot;half&quot;, was shifted to instead, derived from Middle English .
* An unrounded back vowel developed, found in certain classes of words that had previously had , like &quot;start&quot;, &quot;father&quot; and &quot;palm&quot;.

That left the standard form of the language with four open back vowels:
* in &quot;lot&quot; and &quot;want&quot;.
* in &quot;cloth&quot; and &quot;cost&quot;.
* in &quot;start&quot;, &quot;father&quot; and &quot;palm&quot;.
* in &quot;tor&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, and &quot;corn&quot;.

===Later changes===
From the 18th century on, the following changes have occurred:
* The three-way distinction between , , and was simplified in one of two ways:
** In General American and old-fashioned RP, was raised to , merging with the vowel in (the &quot;cloth-thought&quot; merger).
** In many accents of England, the lengthening of the set was undone, restoring the short pronunciation . This became standard RP by the mid-20th century.
* In General American, the &quot;lot&quot; vowel has become unrounded and merged into (the &quot;father–bother&quot; merger).

This leaves RP with three back vowels:
* in &quot;lot&quot;, &quot;want&quot;, &quot;cloth&quot;, and &quot;cost&quot;.
* in &quot;tor&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, and &quot;corn&quot;.
* in &quot;start&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, and &quot;palm&quot;.

and General American with two:
* in &quot;lot&quot;, &quot;want&quot;, &quot;start&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, and &quot;palm&quot;.
* in &quot;tor&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;corn&quot;, &quot;cloth&quot; and &quot;cost&quot;.

==Unrounded ==
In a few varieties of English, the vowel in &quot;lot&quot; is unrounded, pronounced toward []. This is found in the following dialects:
* Most of Irish English
* Much of the Caribbean
* Norwich
* The West Country and the West Midlands of England
* Most of North American English
** Excluding northeastern New England English and Western Pennsylvania English, where it is typically raised toward , merging with the vowel in &quot;thought&quot;.

There&#x27;s also evidence for it in South East England as early as the late 16th century and as late as the 19th century.

Linguists disagree as to whether the unrounding of the &quot;lot&quot; vowel occurred independently in North America (probably occurring around the end of the 17th century) or was imported from certain types of speech current in Britain at that time.

In such accents outside of North America, &quot;lot&quot; typically is pronounced as , therefore being kept distinct from the vowel in &quot;palm&quot;, pronounced or . However, the major exception to this is North American English, where the vowel is lengthened to merge with the vowel in &quot;palm&quot;, as described below. This merger is called the merger or more commonly the &quot;father–bother&quot; merger. (See further below.)

===&quot;Father–bother&quot; merger===
The &quot;father–bother&quot; merger is a phonemic merger of the lexical sets and . It represents unrounded &quot;lot&quot;, as detailed above, taken a step further. On top of being unrounded, the length distinction between the vowel in &quot;lot&quot; and &quot;bother&quot; and the vowel in &quot;palm&quot; and &quot;father&quot; is lost, so that the two groups merge. This causes &quot;father&quot; and &quot;bother&quot; to become rhymes.

This occurs in the great majority of North American accents; of the North American dialects that have unrounded &quot;lot&quot;, the only notable exception to the merger is New York City English, where the opposition with the -type vowel is somewhat tenuous.

Examples of possible homophones resulting from the merger include &quot;Khan&quot; and &quot;con&quot; () as well as &quot;Saab&quot; and &quot;sob&quot; ().

While the accents in northeastern New England, such as the Boston accent, also remain unmerged, &quot;lot&quot; remains rounded and merges instead with &quot;cloth&quot; and &quot;thought&quot;.

=={{sc2|LOT–CLOTH}} split==
The {{sc2|LOT–CLOTH}} split is the result of a late 17th-century sound change that lengthened {{IPA|/ɒ/}} to {{IPA|[ɒː]}} before voiceless fricatives, and also before {{IPA|/n/}} in the words &quot;gone&quot; and sometimes &quot;on&quot;. It was ultimately raised and merged with {{IPA|/ɔː/}} of words like &quot;thought&quot;, although in some accents that vowel is actually open {{IPA|[ɒː]}}. This means that {{sc2|CLOTH}} is not a separate vowel; rather, it means &quot;either {{sc2|LOT}} or {{sc2|THOUGHT}}, depending on the accent&quot;. The sound change is most consistent in the last syllable of a word, and much less so elsewhere (see below). Some words that entered the language later, especially when used more in writing than speech, are exempt from the lengthening, e.g. &quot;joss&quot; and &quot;Goth&quot; with the short vowel. Similar changes took place in words with {{angbr|a}}; see &quot;trap–bath&quot; split and /æ/-tensing.

The cot–caught merger, discussed below, has removed the distinction in some dialects.

As a result of the lengthening and raising, in the above-mentioned accents &quot;cross&quot; rhymes with &quot;sauce&quot;, and &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;cloth&quot; also have the vowel {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. Accents affected by this change include American English accents that lack the cot-caught merger and formerly RP, although with the exception of &quot;water&quot; {{IPA|/wɔːtə(r)/}}, today words of this group almost always have short {{IPA|/ɒ/}} in RP.

The lengthening and raising generally happened before the fricatives {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}}, and in the word &quot;water&quot; for an unknown reason (compare the broadening of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father&quot;). In American English, the raising was extended to the environment before velars {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, and sometimes before {{IPA|/k/}} as well, giving pronunciations like {{IPA|/lɔŋ/}} for &quot;long&quot;, {{IPA|/dɔɡ/}} for &quot;dog&quot; and {{IPA|/ˈtʃɔklət/}} for &quot;chocolate&quot;.

In the varieties of American English that have the lot–cloth split, the &quot;lot&quot; vowel is usually symbolized as {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, often called the &quot;short o&quot; for historical reasons, as the corresponding RP vowel {{IPA|/ɒ/}} is still short (and it contrasts with {{IPA|/ɑː/}} as in &quot;father&quot; and &quot;start&quot;). The &quot;thought&quot; vowel is usually transcribed as {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and it is often called the &quot;open o&quot;. Its actual phonetic realization may be open {{IPAblink|ɒ}}, whereas the &quot;lot&quot; vowel may be realized as central {{IPAblink|ä}}. Some words vary as to which vowel they have. For example, words that end in &quot;-og&quot; like &quot;frog&quot;, &quot;hog&quot;, &quot;fog&quot;, &quot;log&quot;, &quot;bog&quot; etc. have {{IPA|/ɑ/}} in some accents and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in others.

There are also significant complexities in the pronunciation of written &quot;o&quot; occurring before one of the triggering phonemes {{IPA|/f θ s ŋ ɡ/}} in a non-final syllable. In other cases, however, the use of the open o as opposed to the short o is largely predictable. Just like with /æ/-tensing and the trap–bath split, there seems to be an open-syllable constraint. Namely, the change did not affect words with /ɑ/ in open syllables unless they were closely derived from words with {{IPA|/ɑ/}} in closed syllables. Hence {{IPA|/ɔ/}} occurs in &quot;crossing&quot;, &quot;crosser&quot;, &quot;crosses&quot; because it occurs in &quot;cross&quot;. In contrast, &quot;possible&quot;, &quot;jostle&quot;, &quot;impostor&quot;, &quot;profit&quot;, &quot;Gothic&quot;, and &quot;boggle&quot; all have {{IPA|/ɑ/}}. However, there are still exceptions in words like &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;foster&quot;. A further list of words is mentioned in the table below:

Some words may vary depending on the speaker like (&quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;offer&quot;, &quot;donkey&quot;, &quot;soggy&quot;, &quot;boondoggle&quot;, etc. with either {{IPA|/ɑ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ/}}).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Meanwhile, other words vary by region. For example, the word &quot;on&quot;, which in Northern American English dialects without the cot-caught merger is pronounced {{IPA|/ɑn/}}, rhyming with &quot;don&quot;, but in Midland and Southern American English without the merger is pronounced {{IPA|/ɔn/}}, rhyming with &quot;dawn&quot;. The isogloss for this difference, termed the &quot;ON line&quot;, lies between New York City and Philadelphia on the East Coast and runs West as far as speakers without the merger can be found.{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=189}} Pronunciation of the word &quot;want&quot; as {{IPA|/wɔnt/}} is also strongly associated with the South.

==&quot;Cot–caught&quot; merger==
{{main|Cot–caught merger{{!}}&quot;Cot–caught&quot; merger}}

The &quot;cot&quot;–&quot;caught&quot; merger (also known as the low back merger or the {{sc2|LOT–THOUGHT}} merger) is a phonemic merger occurring in many accents of English, where the vowel sound in words like &quot;cot&quot;, &quot;nod&quot;, and &quot;stock&quot; (the {{sc2|LOT}} vowel), has merged with that of &quot;caught&quot;, &quot;gnawed&quot;, and &quot;stalk&quot; (the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel). For example, with the merger, &quot;cot&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; become perfect homophones.

==Other changes==
==={{sc2|GOAT–THOUGHT}} merger===
The {{sc2|GOAT–THOUGHT}} merger is a merger of the English vowels of {{sc2|GOAT}} {{IPA|/oʊ/}} and {{sc2|THOUGHT}} {{IPA|/ɔː/}} that has been reported in Geordie since the late 20th century, with a quality around [oː]. The merger is more common among younger female speakers.

The merger also exists among older speakers in Bradford English with a quality around [ɔː], but younger speakers are more likely to resist the merger by fronting the {{sc2|GOAT}} vowel.

==={{sc2|THOUGHT}} split===
In some London accents of English, the vowel in words such as &quot;thought,&quot; &quot;force,&quot; and &quot;north,&quot; which merged earlier on in these varieties of English, undergoes a conditional split based on syllable structure: closed syllables have a higher vowel quality such as {{IPA|[oː]}} (possibly even {{IPA|[oʊ]}} in broad Cockney varieties), and open syllables have a lower vowel quality {{IPA|[ɔ̝ː]}} or a centering diphthong {{IPA|[ɔə]}}.

Originally-open syllables with an inflectional suffix (such as &quot;bored&quot;) retain the lower vowel quality, creating minimal pairs such as &quot;bored&quot; {{IPA|[bɔəd]}} vs. &quot;board&quot; {{IPA|[boːd]}}.{{sfnp|Ostalski|2009|pp=106–107}}

In broad Geordie, some {{sc2|THOUGHT}} words (roughly, those spelled with &quot;a&quot;, as in &quot;walk&quot; and &quot;talk&quot;) have {{IPAblink|aː}} (which phonetically is the long counterpart of {{sc2|TRAP}} {{IPA|/a/}}) instead of the standard {{IPAblink|ɔː}}. Those are the traditional dialect forms which are being replaced with the standard {{IPAblink|ɔː}}. {{IPAblink|aː}} is therefore not necessarily a distinct phoneme in the vowel system of Geordie, also because it occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/a/}} before voiced consonants.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=360, 375}}

==={{sc2|WRATH-ROTH}} merger===
The {{sc2|WRATH-ROTH}} merger is a merger of the English vowel of {{sc2|WRATH}} {{IPA|/æ~ɑː/}} into the vowel of {{sc2|ROTH}} {{IPA|/ɒ~ɔ(ː)/}} that appears in Received Pronunciation and some speakers of New Zealand English, occurring only when the vowel appears after &quot;wr&quot; (historical {{IPA|/wr/}}).

==Distribution of {{IPA|/ɑː/}}==
The distribution of the vowel transcribed with {{angbr IPA|ɑː}} in broad IPA varies greatly among dialects. It corresponds to {{IPA|/æ/}}, {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, {{IPA|/ɔː/}} and (when not prevocalic within the same word) {{IPA|/ɑːr/}} and even {{IPA|/ɔːr/}} in other dialects:
* In non-rhotic dialects spoken outside of North America, {{IPA|/ɑː/}} corresponds mostly to {{IPA|/ɑːr/}} in General American and so is most often spelled {{angbr|ar}}. In dialects with the trap–bath split (such as Received Pronunciation, New Zealand English and South African English), it also corresponds to GA {{IPA|/æ/}}, which means that it can also be spelled {{angbr|a}} before voiceless fricatives. In those dialects, {{IPA|/ɒ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː/}} are separate phonemes.
* In native words, {{IPA|/ɑː/}} in most non-rhotic speech of North America corresponds to both {{IPA|/ɑːr/}} in GA (RP {{IPA|/ɑː/}}) and {{IPA|/ɒ/}} in RP, as those dialects feature the father–bother merger.
* North American English features the &quot;father–bother&quot; merger, where {{IPA|/ɑː/}} often corresponds to {{IPA|/ɒ/}} in RP. Only New York City English and New England English distinguish between the two, and with an unrounded {{sc2|LOT}} vowel. Modern-day New York City English also has rounded {{IPA|/ɒː/}} for reflexes of {{sc2|PALM}}, which ironically, came from an unrounded vowel.
* The cot–caught merger usually occurs in addition to the father–bother merger. This applies to almost all of Canadian English and many varieties of American English. The result is usually {{IPA|/ɑ(ː)/}}, the {{sc2|PALM}} vowel, which is used for {{sc2|LOT}} as well. Some dialects will have {{IPA|/ɒ(ː)/}} as the merged vowel, not {{IPA|/ɑ(ː)/}}; these include Standard Canadian English or Pittsburgh English.
** The &quot;caught-cot&quot; merger &quot;without&quot; the &quot;father–bother&quot; merger is found in Scottish English and most of New England English.
* In loanwords and names, the open central unrounded vowel {{IPAblink|ä}} in a source language is regularly approximated with {{IPA|/ɑ(ː)/}} in North America and {{IPA|/æ/}} in RP. However, in the case of mid back rounded vowels spelled {{angbr|o}}, the usual North American approximation is {{IPA|/oʊ/}}, not {{IPA|/ɑː/}} (in RP, it can be either {{IPA|/əʊ/}} or {{IPA|/ɒ/}}). However, when the vowel is both stressed and word-final, the only possibilities in RP are {{IPA|/ɑː/}} in the first case and {{IPA|/əʊ/}} in the latter case, mirroring GA.

For the sake of simplicity, instances of an unrounded {{sc2|LOT}} vowel (phonetically {{IPAblink|ɑ}}) that do not merge with {{sc2|PALM}}/{{sc2|START}} are excluded from the table below. For this reason, the traditional Norfolk dialect is included but the contemporary one, nor the Cardiff dialect, are not.

==Fronted {{IPA|/oʊ/}}==
{{see also|English-language vowel changes before historic /l/#Goat split}}

In many dialects of English, the vowel {{IPA|/oʊ/}} has undergone fronting. The exact phonetic value varies. Dialects with the fronted {{IPA|/oʊ/}} include Received Pronunciation; Southern, Midland, and Mid-Atlantic American English; and Australian English. This fronting does not generally occur before {{IPA|/l/}}, a relatively retracted consonant.

<doc id="277184" wikidata="Q1140046" url="?curid=277184" title="Mathematical notation">
<text>Mathematical notation consists of using symbols for representing operations, unspecified numbers, relations, and any other mathematical objects and assembling them into expressions and formulas. Mathematical notation is widely used in mathematics, science, and engineering for representing complex concepts and properties in a concise, unambiguous, and accurate way.

For example, the physicist Albert Einstein&#x27;s formula formula_1 is the quantitative representation in mathematical notation of mass–energy equivalence.

Mathematical notation was first introduced by François Viète at the end of the 16th century and largely expanded during the 17th and 18th centuries by René Descartes, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and overall Leonhard Euler.

== Symbols ==
The use of many symbols is the basis of mathematical notation. They play a similar role as words in natural languages. They may play different roles in mathematical notation similarly as verbs, adjective and nouns play different roles in a sentence.

=== Letters as symbols===
Letters are typically used for naming—in mathematical jargon, one says &quot;representing&quot;—mathematical objects. The Latin and Greek alphabets are used extensively, but a few letters of other alphabets are also used sporadically, such as the Hebrew , Cyrillic , and Hiragana . Uppercase and lowercase letters are considered as different symbols. For Latin alphabet, different typefaces also provide different symbols. For example, formula_2 and formula_3 could theoretically appear in the same mathematical text with six different meanings. Normally, roman upright typeface is not used for symbols, except for symbols representing a standard function, such as the symbol &quot;formula_4&quot; of the sine function.

In order to have more symbols, and for allowing related mathematical objects to be represented by related symbols, diacritics, subscripts and superscripts are often used. For example, formula_5 may denote the Fourier transform of the derivative of a function called formula_6

=== Other symbols ===
Symbols are not only used for naming mathematical objects. They can be used for operations formula_7 for relations formula_8 for logical connectives formula_9 for quantifiers formula_10 and for other purposes.

Some symbols are similar to Latin or Greek letters, some are obtained by deforming letters, some are traditional typographic symbols, but many have been specially designed for mathematics.

== Expressions ==
An expression is a finite combination of symbols that is well-formed according to rules that depend on the context. In general, an expression denotes or names a mathematical object, and plays therefore in the language of mathematics the role of a noun phrase in the natural language.

An expression contains often some operators, and may therefore be &quot;evaluated&quot; by the action of the operators in it. For example, formula_11 is an expression in which the operator formula_12 can be evaluated for giving the result formula_13 So, formula_11 and formula_15 are two different expressions that represent the same number. This is the meaning of the equality formula_16

A more complicated example is given by the expressionformula_17 that can be evaluated to formula_18 Although the resulting expression contains the operators of division, subtraction and exponentiation, it cannot be evaluated further because and denote unspecified numbers.

== History ==
=== Numbers ===
It is believed that a notation to represent numbers was first developed at least 50,000 years ago. Early mathematical ideas such as finger counting have also been represented by collections of rocks, sticks, bone, clay, stone, wood carvings, and knotted ropes. The tally stick is a way of counting dating back to the Upper Paleolithic. Perhaps the oldest known mathematical texts are those of ancient Sumer. The Census Quipu of the Andes and the Ishango Bone from Africa both used the tally mark method of accounting for numerical concepts.

The concept of zero and the introduction of a notation for it are important developments in early mathematics, which predates for centuries the concept of zero as a number. It was used as a placeholder by the Babylonians and Greek Egyptians, and then as an integer by the Mayans, Indians and Arabs (see the history of zero).

=== Modern notation ===
Until the 16th century, mathematics was essentially rhetorical, in the sense that everything but explicit numbers was expressed in words. However, some authors such as Diophantus used some symbols as abbreviations. 

The first systematic use of formulas, and, in particular the use of symbols (variables) for unspecified numbers is generally attributed to François Viète (16th century). However, he used different symbols than those that are now standard.

Later, René Descartes (17th century) introduced the modern notation for variables and equations; in particular, the use of formula_19 for unknown quantities and formula_20 for known ones (constants). He introduced also the notation and the term &quot;imaginary&quot; for the imaginary unit.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw the standardization of mathematical notation as used today. Leonhard Euler was responsible for many of the notations currently in use: the functional notation formula_21 for the base of the natural logarithm, formula_22 for summation, etc. He also popularized the use of for the Archimedes constant (proposed by William Jones, based on an earlier notation of William Oughtred).

Since then many new notations have been introduced, often specific to a particular area of mathematics. Some notations are named after their inventors, such as Leibniz&#x27;s notation, Legendre symbol, the Einstein summation convention, etc.

=== Typesetting ===
General typesetting systems are generally not well suited for mathematical notation. One of the reasons is that, in mathematical notation, the symbols are often arranged in two-dimensional figures, such as in:
: formula_23

TeX is a mathematically oriented typesetting system that was created in 1978 by Donald Knuth. It is widely used in mathematics, through its extension called LaTeX, and is a &quot;de facto&quot; standard. (The above expression is written in LaTeX.)

More recently, another approach for mathematical typesetting is provided by MathML. However, it is not well supported in web browsers, which is its primary target.

== International standard mathematical notation ==
The international standard ISO 80000-2 (previously, ISO 31-11) specifies symbols for use in mathematical equations. The standard requires use of italic fonts for variables (e.g., ) and roman (upright) fonts for mathematical constants (e.g., e or π).

== Non-Latin-based mathematical notation ==
Modern Arabic mathematical notation is based mostly on the Arabic alphabet and is used widely in the Arab world, especially in pre-tertiary education. (Western notation uses Arabic numerals, but the Arabic notation also replaces Latin letters and related symbols with Arabic script.)

In addition to Arabic notation, mathematics also makes use of Greek letters to denote a wide variety of mathematical objects and variables. On some occasions, certain Hebrew letters are also used (such as in the context of infinite cardinals).

Some mathematical notations are mostly diagrammatic, and so are almost entirely script independent. Examples are Penrose graphical notation and Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams.

Braille-based mathematical notations used by blind people include Nemeth Braille and GS8 Braille.

<doc id="277195" wikidata="Q5566979" url="?curid=277195" title="Glasgow dialect">
<text>The Glasgow dialect, also called Glaswegian, varies from Scottish English at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum to the local dialect of West Central Scots at the other. Therefore, the speech of many Glaswegians can draw on a &quot;continuum between fully localised and fully standardised&quot;. Additionally, the Glasgow dialect has Highland English and Hiberno-English influences owing to the speech of Highlanders and Irish people who migrated in large numbers to the Glasgow area in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While being named for Glasgow, the accent is typical for natives across the full Greater Glasgow area and associated counties such as Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Dunbartonshire and parts of Ayrshire, which formerly came under the single authority of Strathclyde. It is most common in working class people, which can lead to stigma from members of other classes or those outside Glasgow.

As with other dialects, it is subject to dialect levelling where particularly Scots vocabulary is replaced by Standard English words and, in particular, words largely from colloquial English. However, Glaswegians continue to create new euphemisms and nicknames for well-known local figures and buildings.

==Literature==
The Glasgow vernacular has also established itself in Scottish literature. Many authors spell some of the Scots elements phonetically, often coinciding with common spelling errors, rather than using the prestigious Modern Scots conventions. The general effect of that, particularly its comic forms, is to exaggerate the unintelligibility of Glasgow speech to outsiders. The resulting orthographic representation of the vernacular gives the overall impression of an anti-standard rather than a local standard.

Michael Munro wrote a guide to Glaswegian entitled &quot;The Patter&quot;, first published in 1985. With illustrations by David Neilson, and later by the Paisley-born artist and playwright John Byrne, the book was followed by &quot;The Patter – Another Blast&quot; in 1988, with &quot;The Complete Patter&quot;, an updated compendium of the first and second books, being published in 1996.

James Kelman&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;How Late It Was, How Late&quot; is written largely in Glaswegian dialect from the point of view of Sammy Samuels, a 38-year-old ex-convict who wakes up blind after a drinking binge and a fight with police. The novel won the 1994 Booker Prize.

Jamie Stuart, a Church of Scotland elder from the High Carntyne Church, produced &quot;A Glasgow Bible&quot; in 1997, relating some biblical tales in the Glaswegian vernacular. More recently, in 2014 &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; was translated into Glaswegian Scots by Thomas Clark as &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventirs in Wunnerlaun&quot;.

A 2020 Graeme Armstrong novel, &quot;The Young Team&quot;, narrated by a gang member in the local dialect, focuses on the &#x27;ned culture&#x27; of the region in the early 21st century (albeit set in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire a few miles east of Glasgow rather than in the city itself). Armstrong, who had been inspired by the style used by Irvine Welsh for &quot;Trainspotting&quot; – written in the similar but distinct accent of Edinburgh – struggled to have his novel published and was advised to mitigate the use of the dialect to appeal to a wider audience, but refused to compromise the authenticity of the characters&#x27; voices.

==Phonology==
Jane Stuart-Smith defined two varieties for descriptive purposes in a chapter of the 1999 book &quot;Urban Voices&quot; entitled &quot;Glasgow: accent and voice quality&quot;:
* Glasgow Standard English (GSE), the Glaswegian form of Scottish English, spoken by most middle-class speakers
* Glasgow vernacular (GV), the dialect of many working-class speakers, which is historically based on West-Central Scots, but which shows strong influences from Irish English, its own distinctive slang and increased levelling towards GSE

Differences between the two systems are mostly in lexical incidence. Many working-class speakers use the SSE system when reading aloud, albeit with different qualities for the vowels. The table below shows the vowels used in both variants below:

 describes notable features of consonants that distinguish the Glasgow dialect from other dialects.
* T-glottalization is &quot;strongly stigmatized yet extremely common&quot;. Glottalization also occurs of and , albeit less frequently.
* and can be pronounced with dentalisation. is sometimes omitted at the end of a word (e.g. &quot;old&quot;, &quot;stand&quot;).
* Th-fronting occurs with some younger speakers.
* is used in words such as &quot;loch&quot;, although this is dying out amongst younger speakers.
* is used in words beginning &quot;wh&quot; (e.g. &quot;whine&quot;).
* There is no H-dropping except in unstressed cases of &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her&quot;.
* Yod-dropping only occurs after or .
* Most Glasgow speech is rhotic, but non-rhoticity can be found amongst some younger working-class speakers. The realisation of can be , or .
* is a dark &quot;l&quot; in almost all positions.

==In the media==

In the 1970s, the Glasgow-born comedian Stanley Baxter parodied the patter on his television sketch show. &quot;Parliamo Glasgow&quot; was a spoof programme in which Baxter played a language coach and various scenarios using Glaswegian dialogue were played out for laughs. Popular television comedies using the dialect include &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;, &quot;Chewin&#x27; the Fat&quot;, &quot;Still Game&quot;, &quot;Burnistoun&quot; and &quot;Limmy&#x27;s Show&quot;.

The 1998 film by Ken Loach, &quot;My Name is Joe&quot;, is one of the few films recorded [almost] entirely in Glasgow dialect. As a result, the film had to be given subtitles when released in the United States and even for audiences in England. The same situation occurred with another Loach film, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;, based in the town of Greenock which has a local accent virtually identical to that of Glasgow, and with the 2010 release &quot;Neds&quot; set in the city.

==Alleged influence from Cockney==
Studies have indicated that working-class adolescents in areas such as Glasgow have begun to use certain aspects of Cockney and other Anglicisms in their speech, infiltrating the traditional Glasgow speech. For example, th-fronting is commonly found, and typical Scottish features such as the post-vocalic /r/ are reduced, although this last feature is more likely to be a development of Central Belt Scots origin, unrelated to Anglo-English nonrhoticity. Researches suggest the use of English speech characteristics is likely to be consequential on the influence of London and south east England accents which feature prominently on television.

The linguist John C. Wells, a critic of the media reporting on Estuary English, has questioned whether Glasgow is being influenced by Cockney speech. He claimed that journalists had misrepresented the prevalence of th-fronting in Glasgow and that there is no evidence that th-fronting originated in London. He also wrote that all dialects change over time and that change does not mean that the Glasgow patter will disappear.

<text>Estrildidae, or estrildid finches, is a family of small seed-eating passerine birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They comprise species commonly known as munias, mannikins, firefinches, parrotfinches and waxbills.

They are gregarious and often colonial seed eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but vary widely in plumage colours and patterns.

All estrildids build large, domed nests and lay five to ten white eggs. Many species build roost nests. Some of the firefinches and pytilias are hosts to the brood-parasitic indigobirds and whydahs, respectively.

Most are sensitive to cold and require warm, usually tropical, habitats, although a few, such as the eastern alpine mannikin, mountain firetail, red-browed finch, and the genus &quot;Stagonopleura&quot;, have adapted to the cooler climates of southern Australia and the highlands of New Guinea.

The smallest species of the family is the Shelley&#x27;s oliveback (&quot;Nesocharis shelleyi&quot;) at a mere , although the lightest species is the black-rumped waxbill (&quot;Estrilda troglodytes&quot;) at . The largest species is the Java sparrow (&quot;Padda oryzivora&quot;) at and .

==Taxonomy==
The family Estrildidae was introduced in 1850 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte as &quot;Estreldinae&quot;, a spelling variant of the subfamily name. In the list of world birds maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC) the family contains 140 species divided into 41 genera. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown the family Estrildidae is sister to the family Viduidae containing the indigobirds and whydahs. The two families diverged around 15.5 million year ago. The most recent common ancestor of the Estrildidae is estimated to have lived around 10.9 million years ago. A genetic study of the Estrildidae by Urban Olsson and Per Alström published in 2020 identified 6 major clades. The radiations within these clades occurred between 4.5 and 8.9 million years ago. The authors proposed that each of these clades should be treated as a subfamily. This contrasts with an earlier proposal in which the family was divided into three subfamilies.

<doc id="277205" wikidata="Q374898" url="?curid=277205" title="Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant">
<text>The Ludington Pumped Storage Plant is a hydroelectric plant and reservoir in Ludington, Michigan. It was built between 1969 and 1973 at a cost of $315 million and is owned jointly by Consumers Energy and DTE Energy and operated by Consumers Energy. At the time of its construction, it was the largest pumped storage hydroelectric facility in the world.

== Characteristics ==

It consists of a reservoir deep, long, and wide which holds or 82859 acre-feet of water. The reservoir is located on the banks of Lake Michigan. Because impervious bedrock is more than below the reservoir, the builders had to line the reservoir with a layer of asphalt and clay to prevent water seeping into the ground.

The power plant consists of six reversible turbines that can each generate 312 megawatts of electricity for a total output of 1,872 megawatts. Water is delivered from the upper reservoir to the turbines by six penstocks each long that taper from in diameter.

At night, during low demand for electricity, the turbines run in reverse to pump water uphill from Lake Michigan into the reservoir. The plant takes advantage of the natural steep sand dune landform of eastern Lake Michigan. During periods of peak demand water is released to generate power. Electrical generation can begin within two minutes with peak electric output of 1872 MW achieved in under 30 minutes. Maximum water flow is over per minute.

This process was designed to level the load of nearby nuclear power plants on the grid. It also replaces the need to build natural gas peak power plants used only during high demand. The Ludington Pumped Storage plant is connected to six 345-kV Transmission lines, all owned and maintained by METC, a subsidiary of ITC Holdings.

The project was given the 1973 award for &quot;Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement&quot; by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

== Upgrade ==

Consumers Energy discussed plans in 2008 to extend the life of the facility and upgrade the pumps to increase efficiency by up to 9%. Consumers Energy also planned to tap the wind power resources along the eastern Lake Michigan shore with wind farms. Because wind is an intermittent power source and may inconveniently deliver large amounts of power during periods of low electric demand, pumped storage facilities are desirable to have on the same grid with large-scale wind farms. The available pumped storage capacity, along with the wind characteristics, partly determine the maximum contribution wind power can make to the overall electricity use in a region.

Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison announced an $800 million upgrade on February 7, 2011. The six-year project would begin in 2013 and extend the plant&#x27;s life by at least forty years and upgrade the generating capacity from 1,872 megawatts to 2,172 megawatts. Plans for the upgrade include replacing all six of the plant&#x27;s turbines, which would increase the plant&#x27;s total generating capacity by 15 percent, and efficiency by 5 percent. Upon completion, the plant will produce enough power for a community of 1.65 million (a quarter million increase).
As of August 2020, five of the six turbines had been successfully replaced; the project was expected to be completed in May or June 2021. However claims of defective parts and timeline overruns led Consumers Power and Detroit Edison to sue the project contractor, Toshiba America in April 2022.

<doc id="277206" wikidata="Q210115" url="?curid=277206" title="Freethought">
<text>Freethought (sometimes spelled free thought) is an unorthodox attitude or belief. 

A freethinker holds that beliefs should not be formed on the basis of authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma, and should instead be reached by other methods such as logic, reason, and empirical observation. According to the &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot;, a freethinker is &quot;One who is mentally free from the conventional bonds of tradition or dogma, and thinks independently.&quot; In some contemporary thought in particular, free thought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems. The cognitive application of free thought is known as &quot;freethinking&quot;, and practitioners of free thought are known as &quot;freethinkers&quot;. Modern freethinkers consider free thought to be a natural freedom from all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from society. 

The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to refer to people who inquired into the basis of traditional beliefs which were often accepted unquestioningly. Today, freethinking is most closely linked with agnosticism, deism, secularism, humanism, anti-clericalism, and religious critique. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines freethinking as, &quot;The free exercise of reason in matters of religious belief, unrestrained by deference to authority; the adoption of the principles of a free-thinker.&quot; Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, scientific inquiry, and logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of confirmation bias, cognitive bias, conventional wisdom, popular culture, prejudice, or sectarianism.

==Definition==
Atheist author Adam Lee defines free thought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and authority, and considers it as a &quot;broader umbrella&quot; than atheism &quot;that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking.&quot;

The basic summarizing statement of the essay &quot;The Ethics of Belief&quot; by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher William Kingdon Clifford is: &quot;It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.&quot; The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground. Clifford was himself an organizer of free thought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding religion, freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of supernatural phenomena. According to the Freedom from Religion Foundation, &quot;No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, creed, or messiah. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth.&quot; and &quot;Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful.&quot;
However, philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote the following in his 1944 essay &quot;The Value of Free Thought&quot;:

A freethinker, according to Russell, is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:

Fred Edwords, former executive of the American Humanist Association, suggests that by Russell&#x27;s definition, liberal religionists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.

On the other hand, according to Bertrand Russell, atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions Stalin, whom he compares to a &quot;pope&quot;:

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were deists, arguing that the nature of God can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, &quot;deism&quot; was as much of a &#x27;dirty word&#x27; as &quot;atheism&quot;, and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents. Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the free thought movement than atheists.

==Characteristics==
Among freethinkers, for a notion to be considered true it must be testable, verifiable, and logical. Many freethinkers tend to be humanists, who base morality on human needs and would find meaning in human compassion, social progress, art, personal happiness, love, and the furtherance of knowledge. Generally, freethinkers like to think for themselves, tend to be skeptical, respect critical thinking and reason, remain open to new concepts, and are sometimes proud of their own individuality. They would determine truth for themselves – based upon knowledge they gain, answers they receive, experiences they have and the balance they thus acquire. Freethinkers reject conformity for the sake of conformity, whereby they create their own beliefs by considering the way the world around them works and would possess the intellectual integrity and courage to think outside of accepted norms, which may or may not lead them to believe in some higher power.

==Symbol==
The pansy serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of free thought; literature of the American Secular Union inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of free thought lies both in the flower&#x27;s name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the French word &quot;pensée&quot;, which means &quot;thought&quot;. It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought. In the 1880s, following examples set by freethinkers in France, Belgium, Spain and Sweden, it was proposed in the United States as &quot;the symbol of religious liberty and freedom of conscience&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in Ireland and in the Iranian civilizations (for example in the era of Khayyam (1048–1131) and his unorthodox Sufi &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; poems). Later societies made advances on freedom of thought such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the Southern Song dynasty of 1127–1279), on through heretical thinkers on esoteric alchemy or astrology, to the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation pioneered by Martin Luther.

French physician and writer Rabelais celebrated &quot;rabelaisian&quot; freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of conformist orthodoxy in his utopian Thelema Abbey (from θέλημα: free &quot;will&quot;), the device of which was &quot;Do What Thou Wilt&quot;:

So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
When Rabelais&#x27;s hero Pantagruel journeys to the &quot;Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle&quot;, he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: &quot;Trinch!&quot;, Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua&#x27;s prologue-metaphor instructs the reader to &quot;break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow&quot; (&quot;la substantifique moëlle&quot;), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern free thought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of Giordano Bruno, a former Dominican friar, by the Inquisition.

====Australia====
Prior to World War II, Australia had high rates of Protestantism and Catholicism. Post-war Australia has become a highly secularised country. Donald Horne, one of Australia&#x27;s well-known public intellectuals, believed rising prosperity in post-war Australia influenced the decline in church-going and general lack of interest in religion. &quot;Churches no longer matter very much to most Australians. If there is a happy eternal life it&#x27;s for everyone ... For many Australians the pleasures of this life are sufficiently satisfying that religion offers nothing of great appeal&quot;, said Horne in his landmark work &quot;The Lucky Country&quot; (1964).

====Belgium====
The Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, lay philosophy and ethics, while rejecting the argument of authority.

====Canada====
In 1873, a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in English Canada, the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour &quot;aristocracy&quot;, including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, T. Phillips Thompson, became a central figure in the city&#x27;s labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada&#x27;s foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered free thought organizations operated throughout southern Ontario and parts of Quebec, eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the free thought movement in Canada was &quot;Secular Thought&quot; (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker Charles Watts (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England. In 1968 the Humanist Association of Canada (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when Denis Diderot, Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and Voltaire included an article on &quot;Liberté de penser&quot; in their Encyclopédie. The concept of free thought spread so widely that even places as remote as the Jotunheimen, in Norway, had well-known freethinkers such as Jo Gjende by the 19th century.

François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre (1745–1766) was a young French nobleman, famous for having been tortured and beheaded before his body was burnt on a pyre along with Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot;. La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a Roman Catholic religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian religious intolerance; La Barre along with Jean Calas and Pierre-Paul Sirven, was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris at the summit of the butte Montmartre (itself named from the &quot;Temple of Mars&quot;), the highest point in Paris and an 18th arrondissement street nearby the Sacré-Cœur is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

The 19th century saw the emergence of a specific notion of &quot;Libre-Pensée&quot; (&quot;free thought&quot;), with writer Victor Hugo as one of its major early proponents. French Freethinkers (&quot;Libre-Penseurs&quot;) associate freedom of thought, political anti-clericalism and socialist leanings. The main organisation referring to this tradition to this day is the Fédération nationale de la libre pensée, created in 1890.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the March Revolution, the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of Johannes Ronge and Robert Blum, belief in the rights of man, tolerance among men, and humanism grew, and by 1859 they had established the &quot;Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands&quot; (literally &quot;Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany&quot;), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in Frankfurt am Main, Ludwig Büchner established the &quot;Deutscher Freidenkerbund&quot; (German Freethinkers League) as the first German organization for atheists and agnostics. In 1892 the &quot;Freidenker-Gesellschaft&quot; and in 1906 the &quot;Deutscher Monistenbund&quot; were formed.

Free thought organizations developed the &quot;Jugendweihe&quot; (literally &quot;Youth consecration&quot;), a secular &quot;confirmation&quot; ceremony, and atheist funeral rites. The Union of Freethinkers for Cremation was founded in 1905, and the Central Union of German Proletariat Freethinker in 1908. The two groups merged in 1927, becoming the German Freethinking Association in 1930.

More &quot;bourgeois&quot; organizations declined after World War I, and &quot;proletarian&quot; free thought groups proliferated, becoming an organization of socialist parties. European socialist free thought groups formed the International of Proletarian Freethinkers (IPF) in 1925. Activists agitated for Germans to disaffiliate from their respective Church and for secularization of elementary schools; between 1919–1921 and 1930–1932 more than 2.5 million Germans, for the most part supporters of the Social Democratic and Communist parties, gave up church membership. Conflict developed between radical forces including the Soviet League of the Militant Godless and Social Democratic forces in Western Europe led by Theodor Hartwig and Max Sievers. In 1930 the Soviet and allied delegations, following a walk-out, took over the IPF and excluded the former leaders.
Following Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, most free thought organizations were banned, though some right-wing groups that worked with so-called &quot;Völkische Bünde&quot; (literally &quot;&quot;ethnic&quot; associations&quot; with nationalist, xenophobic and very often racist ideology) were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.

====Ireland====
In the 19th century, received opinion was scandalized by George Ensor (1769–1843). His &quot;Review of the Miracles, Prophecies, &amp; Mysteries of the Old and New Testaments&quot; (1835) argued that, far from being a source of moral teaching, revealed religion and its divines regarded questions of morality as &quot;incidental&quot;--as a &quot;mundane and merely philosophical&quot; topic.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, free thought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as De Vrije Gedachte) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, Multatuli, Adriaan Gerhard and Domela Nieuwenhuis.

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, free thought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;liberty&quot;, and &quot;individualism&quot;.

====Switzerland====
With the introduction of cantonal church taxes in the 1870s, anti-clericals began to organise themselves. Around 1870, a &quot;freethinkers club&quot; was founded in Zürich. During the debate on the Zürich church law in 1883, professor Friedrich Salomon Vögelin and city council member Kunz proposed to separate church and state.

====Turkey====
In the last years of the Ottoman Empire, free thought made its voice heard by the works of distinguished people such as Ahmet Rıza, Tevfik Fikret, Abdullah Cevdet, Kılıçzade Hakkı, and Celal Nuri İleri. These intellectuals affected the early period of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk –field marshal, revolutionary statesman, author, and founder of the secular Turkish nation state, serving as its first President from 1923 until his death in 1938– was the practitioner of their ideas. He made many reforms that modernized the country. Sources point out that Atatürk was a religious skeptic and a freethinker. He was a non-doctrinaire deist or an atheist, who was antireligious and anti-Islamic in general. According to Atatürk, the Turkish people do not know what Islam really is and do not read the Quran. People are influenced by Arabic sentences that they do not understand, and because of their customs they go to mosques. When the Turks read the Quran and think about it, they will leave Islam. Atatürk described Islam as the religion of the Arabs in his own work titled &quot;Vatandaş için Medeni Bilgiler&quot; by his own critical and nationalist views.

Association of Atheism (&quot;Ateizm Derneği&quot;), the first official atheist organisation in Middle East and Caucasus, was founded in 2014. It serves to support irreligious people and freethinkers in Turkey who are discriminated against based on their views. In 2018 it was reported in some media outlets that the Ateizm Derneği would close down because of the pressure on its members and attacks by pro-government media, but the association itself issued a clarification that this was not the case and that it was still active.

====United Kingdom====
The term &quot;freethinker&quot; emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the Church, and the literal belief in the Bible. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by William Molyneux in a widely publicized letter to John Locke, and more extensively in 1713, when Anthony Collins wrote his &quot;Discourse of Free-thinking,&quot; which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for deism.

&quot;The Freethinker&quot; magazine was first published in Britain in 1881; it continued in print until 2014, and still exists as a web-based publication. 

====United States====
The freethought movement first organized itself in the United States as the &quot;Free Press Association&quot; in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of &quot;The Correspondent&quot;, an early journal of Biblical criticism in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible. Houston had helped found an Owenite community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27. The short-lived &quot;Correspondent&quot; was superseded by the &quot;Free Enquirer&quot;, the official organ of Robert Owen&#x27;s New Harmony community in Indiana, edited by Robert Dale Owen and by Fanny Wright between 1828 and 1832 in New York. During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the Workingmen&#x27;s Party in New York City. The &quot;Free Enquirer&quot;&#x27;s annual civic celebrations of Paine&#x27;s birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national freethinkers organization, the &quot;United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge&quot;. It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of Buffalo, New York, as president. Smith was also the 1836 Equal Rights Party&#x27;s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen&#x27;s Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830. The Moral and Philosophical Society published &quot;The Beacon&quot;, edited by Gilbert Vale.
Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an immigration of German freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see Forty-Eighters). In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.
Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including St. Louis, Indianapolis, Wisconsin, and Texas, where they founded the town of Comfort, Texas, as well as others.

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as &quot;Freie Gemeinden&quot;, or &quot;free congregations&quot;. The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850. Others followed in Pennsylvania, California, Washington, D.C., New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, and other states.

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.

The &quot;Golden Age of Freethought&quot; in the US came in the late 1800s. The dominant organization was the National Liberal League which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator Robert G. Ingersoll. Following Ingersoll&#x27;s death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective leadership.

Freethought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. By the early twentieth century, most freethought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches. The longest continuously operating freethought congregation in America is the Free Congregation of Sauk County, Wisconsin, which was founded in 1852 and is still active . It affiliated with the American Unitarian Association (now the Unitarian Universalist Association) in 1955. D. M. Bennett was the founder and publisher of &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot; in 1873, a radical free thought and reform American periodical.

====Anarchism====
=====United States tradition=====
Freethought influenced the development of anarchism in the United States. In the U.S., &quot;free thought was a basically anti-Christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to &quot;Liberty&quot; were prominent figures in both free thought and anarchism. The American individualist anarchist George MacDonald [(1857–1944)] was a co-editor of &quot;Freethought&quot; and, for a time, &quot;The Truth Seeker.&quot; E. C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal &quot;Lucifer, the Light-Bearer&quot;.&quot; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from free thought papers such as &quot;Lucifer, the Light-Bearer&quot;, &quot;Freethought&quot; and &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot; appeared in &quot;Liberty&quot;...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself.&quot;

=====European tradition=====
In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles: &quot;Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist André Lorulot [(1885–1963)], will have its impacts in &quot;Estudios&quot; (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselytism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics&quot;. These tendencies would continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps (1893–1981) and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines &quot;Ética&quot; and &quot;Iniciales&quot; &quot;there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way, there will be a lot of talk on Charles Darwin&#x27;s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul&quot;.

In 1901, the Catalan anarchist and freethinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established &quot;modern&quot; or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools had the stated goal to &quot;educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting&quot;. Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in &quot;freedom in education&quot;, education free from the authority of church and state. Ferrer&#x27;s ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of Modern Schools in the United States, Cuba, South America, and London. The first of these started in New York City in 1911. Ferrer also inspired the Italian newspaper &quot;Università popolare&quot;, founded in 1901.

==Freethinking in Freemasonry==
Freemasonry served an important purpose in the spreading of the freethinking movement, Freemason lodges in 18th century Europe served as sites for enlightenment thinking and discussion of new ideas, helping spread freethought philosophies. The informal, secretive nature of the lodges allowed intellectuals and elites to gather and debate radical topics away from the scrutiny of church and state.

Freemasonry attracted many freethinkers and became a hub of the movement, during the Enlightenment era due to its emphasis on inclusive membership, logic, rationalism, and religious tolerance. Freemasonry&#x27;s origins from stonemason guilds meant its symbolism and rituals drew on concepts from the Trivium and Quadrivium, they include the Mastery of Grammar, Rhetoric, logic then mastery of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy as well as other arts such as the mechanical arts, reflecting Enlightenment ideals in the goal of making its members Masters of their thoughts and opinions thus making them Freethinkers. This distinguished Freemasonry from other fraternal orders focused on chivalry or Christian morality.

===Rationalism and science===
Due to Freemasonry utilizing extensive symbols and allegories related to mathematics, geometry, and architecture, conveying the importance of reason and science, and the central Masonic symbol of the compass and square represented logic and rigor as well references to the &quot;Great Architect of the Universe&quot;, these concepts were interpreted as a deist scientific creator by Enlightenment freethinkers.

Influential early Speculative Masonic writings by James Anderson and Jean-Theophile Desaguliers frequently cited Isaac Newton and promoted Newtonian scientific ideas. Desaguliers was a close friend and student of Newton, further spreading Newton&#x27;s theories to lodges. Geometry textbooks and lectures were common in early lodges, aligning with Enlightenment interest in mathematics and science.

Freemasonry&#x27;s multi-tiered system of initiation rituals allegorically used the tools, stages, and concepts of architecture and mechanics to represent enlightenment and self-improvement through education and reason. This resonated with freethinkers&#x27; belief in perfecting society through spreading knowledge.

===Religious tolerance===
Unlike most contemporary fraternal orders, Freemasonry did not require its members to follow a specific religious creed. This openness allowed men of diverse faiths, including freethinkers and deists, to join local lodges throughout Europe and America in the Enlightenment era. While utilizing religious imagery and themes, Freemasonry intentionally avoided dogmatic disputes and focused its moral lessons on shared values of virtue, charity, and righteousness.

This religious tolerance attracted Enlightenment thinkers, like Voltaire, who viewed organized religion as upholding oppressive traditional monarchs and hindering free thought. Benjamin Franklin praised Masonic principles of &quot;liberality, tolerance and unity in essentials, leaving each Brother to his own opinions on non-essentials&quot; in his writings.

===Political liberalism===
Many Enlightenment freethinkers perceived established religion as upholding traditional monarchies and oppressing free thought. Consequently, the secrecy and hierarchical Initiatory structure of Freemasonry alarmed some authoritarian states, concerned it could encourage liberal revolutionary ideas.

However, most Masonic lodges mainly aimed to promote morality, sociability, and philanthropic causes rather than radical politics. Values of freethinking, liberty, equality, and opposition to tyranny were also celebrated in Masonic rituals and writings. This intellectual spirit likely contributed to many Freemasons supporting independence movements and participating as Founding Fathers of the United States.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, some authoritarian states also suspected Freemasonry of encouraging liberal freethinking philosophies and suppressed Masonic lodges.

===Pursuit of mastery===
A core goal of Freemasonry&#x27;s initiatory system is to guide men&#x27;s intellectual and moral development towards mastery and enlightenment. Masonic rituals and degrees symbolically depict the passage from an Apprentice to Fellowcraft to Master Mason as a metaphor for independent learning and self-improvement to the goal of becoming a Master of himself, thus a full freethinker.

Attaining mastery is presented as freeing a man&#x27;s mind from reliance on authorities and dogmas so he can autonomously reason and have educated opinions. The perfectibility of human nature through education and liberty is a key theme. This aligns with freethinkers&#x27; views on thinking for oneself using logic and empiricism.

<doc id="277213" wikidata="Q1032070" url="?curid=277213" title="Coherent state">
<text>In physics, specifically in quantum mechanics, a coherent state is the specific quantum state of the quantum harmonic oscillator, often described as a state that has dynamics most closely resembling the oscillatory behavior of a classical harmonic oscillator. It was the first example of quantum dynamics when Erwin Schrödinger derived it in 1926, while searching for solutions of the Schrödinger equation that satisfy the correspondence principle. The quantum harmonic oscillator (and hence the coherent states) arise in the quantum theory of a wide range of physical systems. For instance, a coherent state describes the oscillating motion of a particle confined in a quadratic potential well (for an early reference, see e.g. Schiff&#x27;s textbook). The coherent state describes a state in a system for which the ground-state wavepacket is displaced from the origin of the system. This state can be related to classical solutions by a particle oscillating with an amplitude equivalent to the displacement.

These states, expressed as &quot;eigenvectors of the lowering operator&quot; and forming an &quot;overcomplete&quot; family, were introduced in the early papers of John R. Klauder, e.g. 
In the quantum theory of light (quantum electrodynamics) and other bosonic quantum field theories, coherent states were introduced by the work of Roy J. Glauber in 1963 and are also known as Glauber states.

The concept of coherent states has been considerably abstracted; it has become a major topic in mathematical physics and in applied mathematics, with applications ranging from quantization to signal processing and image processing (see Coherent states in mathematical physics). For this reason, the coherent states associated to the quantum harmonic oscillator are sometimes referred to as &quot;canonical coherent states&quot; (CCS), &quot;standard coherent states&quot;, &quot;Gaussian&quot; states, or oscillator states.

== Coherent states in quantum optics ==


In quantum optics the coherent state refers to a state of the quantized electromagnetic field, etc. that describes a maximal kind of coherence and a classical kind of behavior. Erwin Schrödinger derived it as a &quot;minimum uncertainty&quot; Gaussian wavepacket in 1926, searching for solutions of the Schrödinger equation that satisfy the correspondence principle. It is a minimum uncertainty state, with the single free parameter chosen to make the relative dispersion (standard deviation in natural dimensionless units) equal for position and momentum, each being equally small at high energy.

Further, in contrast to the energy eigenstates of the system, the time evolution of a coherent state is concentrated along the classical trajectories. The quantum linear harmonic oscillator, and hence coherent states, arise in the quantum theory of a wide range of physical systems. They occur in the quantum theory of light (quantum electrodynamics) and other bosonic quantum field theories.

While minimum uncertainty Gaussian wave-packets had been well-known, they did not attract full attention until Roy J. Glauber, in 1963, provided a complete quantum-theoretic description of coherence in the electromagnetic field. In this respect, the concurrent contribution of E.C.G. Sudarshan should not be omitted, (there is, however, a note in Glauber&#x27;s paper that reads: &quot;Uses of these states as generating functions for the formula_1-quantum states have, however, been made by J. Schwinger).
Glauber was prompted to do this to provide a description of the Hanbury-Brown &amp; Twiss experiment, which generated very wide baseline (hundreds or thousands of miles) interference patterns that could be used to determine stellar diameters. This opened the door to a much more comprehensive understanding of coherence. (For more, see Quantum mechanical description.)

In classical optics, light is thought of as electromagnetic waves radiating from a source. Often, coherent laser light is thought of as light that is emitted by many such sources that are in phase. Actually, the picture of one photon being in-phase with another is not valid in quantum theory. Laser radiation is produced in a resonant cavity where the resonant frequency of the cavity is the same as the frequency associated with the atomic electron transitions providing energy flow into the field. As energy in the resonant mode builds up, the probability for stimulated emission, in that mode only, increases. That is a positive feedback loop in which the amplitude in the resonant mode increases exponentially until some nonlinear effects limit it. As a counter-example, a light bulb radiates light into a continuum of modes, and there is nothing that selects any one mode over the other. The emission process is highly random in space and time (see thermal light). In a laser, however, light is emitted into a resonant mode, and that mode is highly coherent. Thus, laser light is idealized as a coherent state. (Classically we describe such a state by an electric field oscillating as a stable wave. See Fig.1)

Besides describing lasers, coherent states also behave in a convenient manner when describing the quantum action of beam splitters: two coherent-state input beams will simply convert to two coherent-state beams at the output with new amplitudes given by classical electromagnetic wave formulas; such a simple behaviour does not occur for other input states, including number states. Likewise if a coherent-state light beam is partially absorbed, then the remainder is a pure coherent state with a smaller amplitude, whereas partial absorption of non-coherent-state light produces a more complicated statistical mixed state. Thermal light can be described as a statistical mixture of coherent states, and the typical way of defining nonclassical light is that it cannot be described as a simple statistical mixture of coherent states.

The energy eigenstates of the linear harmonic oscillator (e.g., masses on springs, lattice vibrations in a solid, vibrational motions of nuclei in molecules, or oscillations in the electromagnetic field) are fixed-number quantum states. The Fock state (e.g. a single photon) is the most particle-like state; it has a fixed number of particles, and phase is indeterminate. A coherent state distributes its quantum-mechanical uncertainty equally between the canonically conjugate coordinates, position and momentum, and the relative uncertainty in phase [defined heuristically] and amplitude are roughly equal—and small at high amplitude.

== Quantum mechanical definition ==
Mathematically, a coherent state formula_2 is defined to be the (unique) eigenstate of the annihilation operator with corresponding eigenvalue . Formally, this reads,
:formula_3

Since is not hermitian, is, in general, a complex number. Writing formula_4 || and are called the amplitude and phase of the state formula_2.

The state formula_2 is called a &quot;canonical coherent state&quot; in the literature, since there are many other types of coherent states, as can be seen in the companion article Coherent states in mathematical physics.

Physically, this formula means that a coherent state remains unchanged by the annihilation of field excitation or, say, a charged particle. An eigenstate of the annihilation operator has a Poissonian number distribution when expressed in a basis of energy eigenstates, as shown below. A Poisson distribution is a necessary and sufficient condition that all detections are statistically independent. Contrast this to a single-particle state (formula_7 Fock state): once one particle is detected, there is zero probability of detecting another.

The derivation of this will make use of (unconventionally normalized) &quot;dimensionless operators&quot;, and , normally called &quot;field quadratures&quot; in quantum optics.
(See Nondimensionalization.) These operators are related to the position and momentum operators of a mass on a spring with constant ,
:formula_8

For an optical field, 
:formula_9
are the real and imaginary components of the mode of the electric field inside a cavity of volume formula_10.

With these (dimensionless) operators, the Hamiltonian of either system becomes
:formula_11

Erwin Schrödinger was searching for the most classical-like states when he first introduced minimum uncertainty Gaussian wave-packets. The quantum state of the harmonic oscillator that minimizes the uncertainty relation with uncertainty equally distributed between and satisfies the equation
:formula_12
or, equivalently,
:formula_13
and hence 
:formula_14

Thus, given , Schrödinger found that &quot;the minimum uncertainty states for the linear harmonic oscillator are the eigenstates of&quot; . 
Since &quot;â&quot; is , this is recognizable as a coherent state in the sense of the above definition.

Using the notation for multi-photon states, Glauber characterized the state of complete coherence to all orders in the electromagnetic field to be the eigenstate of the annihilation operator—formally, in a mathematical sense, the same state as found by Schrödinger. The name &quot;coherent state&quot; took hold after Glauber&#x27;s work.

If the uncertainty is minimized, but not necessarily equally balanced between and , the state is called a squeezed coherent state.

The coherent state&#x27;s location in the complex plane (phase space) is centered at the position and momentum of a classical oscillator of the phase and amplitude |&quot;α&quot;| given by the eigenvalue &quot;α&quot; (or the same complex electric field value for an electromagnetic wave). As shown in Figure 5, the uncertainty, equally spread in all directions, is represented by a disk with diameter . As the phase varies, the coherent state circles around the origin and the disk neither distorts nor spreads. This is the most similar a quantum state can be to a single point in phase space.

Since the uncertainty (and hence measurement noise) stays constant at as the amplitude of the oscillation increases, the state behaves increasingly like a sinusoidal wave, as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, since the vacuum state formula_15 is just the coherent state with =0, all coherent states have the same uncertainty as the vacuum. Therefore, one may interpret the quantum noise of a coherent state as being due to vacuum fluctuations.

The notation formula_2 does not refer to a Fock state. For example, when , one should not mistake formula_7 for the single-photon Fock state, which is also denoted formula_7 in its own notation. The expression formula_2 with represents a Poisson distribution of number states formula_20 with a mean photon number of unity.

The formal solution of the eigenvalue equation is the vacuum state displaced to a location in phase space, i.e., it is obtained by letting the unitary displacement operator operate on the vacuum,
:formula_21,
where and .

This can be easily seen, as can virtually all results involving coherent states, using the representation of the coherent state in the basis of Fock states,
:formula_22
where formula_23 are energy (number) eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian 
:formula_24

and the final equality derives from the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. For the corresponding Poissonian distribution, the probability of detecting photons is
:formula_25

Similarly, the average photon number in a coherent state is 
:formula_26
and the variance is 
:formula_27.

That is, the standard deviation of the number detected goes like the square root of the number detected. So in the limit of large , these detection statistics are equivalent to that of a classical stable wave.

These results apply to detection results at a single detector and thus relate to first order coherence (see degree of coherence). However, for measurements correlating detections at multiple detectors, higher-order coherence is involved (e.g., intensity correlations, second order coherence, at two detectors). Glauber&#x27;s definition of quantum coherence involves nth-order correlation functions (n-th order coherence) for all . The perfect coherent state has all n-orders of correlation equal to 1 (coherent). It is perfectly coherent to all orders.

The second-order correlation coefficient formula_28 gives a direct measure of the degree of coherence of photon states in terms of the variance of the photon statistics in the beam under study.

:formula_29
which is easily solved to yield
: formula_30
where is a yet undetermined phase, to be fixed by demanding that the wavefunction satisfies the Schrödinger equation.

It follows that
: formula_31
so that is the initial phase of the eigenvalue.

The mean position and momentum of this &quot;minimal Schrödinger wave packet&quot; are thus oscillating just like a classical system, 
\Re[\alpha(t)]= |\alpha(0)| \sqrt{\frac{2\hbar}{m\omega}} \cos (\sigma - \omega t)~, 
&lt;/math&gt;

The probability density remains a Gaussian centered on this oscillating mean,
:formula_32

== Mathematical features of the canonical coherent states ==
The canonical coherent states described so far have three properties that are mutually equivalent, since each of them completely specifies the state formula_2, namely,
# They are eigenvectors of the annihilation operator:   formula_34.
# They are obtained from the vacuum by application of a unitary displacement operator:  formula_35.
# They are states of (balanced) minimal uncertainty:   formula_36.

Each of these properties may lead to generalizations, in general different from each other (see the article &quot;Coherent states in mathematical physics&quot; for some of these). We emphasize that coherent states have mathematical features that are very different from those of a Fock state; for instance, two different coherent states are not orthogonal,
:formula_37
(linked to the fact that they are eigenvectors of the non-self-adjoint annihilation operator ).

Thus, if the oscillator is in the quantum state formula_38 it is also with nonzero probability in the other quantum state 
formula_39 (but the farther apart the states are situated in phase space, the lower the probability is). However, since they obey a closure relation, any state can be decomposed on the set of coherent states. They hence form an overcomplete basis, in which one can diagonally decompose any state. This is the premise for the Glauber–Sudarshan P representation.

This closure relation can be expressed by the resolution of the identity operator in the vector space of quantum states,
:formula_40
This resolution of the identity is intimately connected to the Segal–Bargmann transform.

Another peculiarity is that formula_41 has no eigenket (while has no eigenbra). The following equality is the closest formal substitute, and turns out to be useful for technical computations,
:formula_42
This last state is known as an &quot;Agarwal state&quot; or photon-added coherent state and denoted as formula_43

Normalized Agarwal states of order can be expressed as 
formula_44

The above resolution of the identity may be derived (restricting to one spatial dimension for simplicity) by taking matrix elements between eigenstates of position, formula_45, on both sides of the equation. On the right-hand side, this immediately gives . On the left-hand side, the same is obtained by inserting 
:formula_46
from the previous section (time is arbitrary), then integrating over formula_47 using the Fourier representation of the delta function, and then performing a Gaussian integral over formula_48.

In particular, the Gaussian Schrödinger wave-packet state follows from the explicit value 
:formula_49

The resolution of the identity may also be expressed in terms of particle position and momentum. For each coordinate dimension (using an adapted notation with new meaning for formula_50), 
:formula_51
the closure relation of coherent states reads
:formula_52
This can be inserted in any quantum-mechanical expectation value, relating it to some quasi-classical phase-space integral and explaining, in particular, the origin of normalisation factors formula_53 for classical partition functions, consistent with quantum 
mechanics.

In addition to being an exact eigenstate of annihilation operators, a coherent state is 
an &quot;approximate&quot; common eigenstate of particle position and momentum. Restricting to 
one dimension again, 
:formula_54
The error in these approximations is measured by the uncertainties 
of position and momentum,
:formula_55

==Thermal coherent state==
A single mode thermal coherent state is produced by displacing a thermal mixed state in phase space, in direct analogy to the displacement of the vacuum state in view of generating a coherent state. The density matrix of a coherent thermal state in operator representation reads

:formula_56

where formula_57 is the displacement operator, which generates the coherent state formula_58 with complex amplitude formula_59, and formula_60 . The partition function is equal to

:formula_61

Using the expansion of the identity operator in Fock states, formula_62, the density operator definition can be expressed in the following form

:formula_63

where formula_64 stands for the displaced Fock state. We remark that if temperature goes to zero we have

:formula_65

which is the density matrix for a coherent state. The average number of photons in that state can be calculated as below

:formula_66

:formula_67

where for the last term we can write

:formula_68

As a result, we find

:formula_69

where formula_70 is the average of the photon number calculated with respect to the thermal state. Here we have defined, for ease of notation,

:formula_71

and we write explicitly

:formula_72

In the limit formula_73 we obtain formula_74, which is consistent with the expression for the density matrix operator at zero temperature. Likewise, the photon number variance can be evaluated as

:formula_75
with formula_76. We deduce that the second moment cannot be uncoupled to the thermal and the quantum distribution moments, unlike the average value (first moment). In that sense, the photon statistics of the displaced thermal state is not described by the sum of the Poisson statistics and the Boltzmann statistics. The distribution of the initial thermal state in phase space broadens as a result of the coherent displacement.

== Coherent states of Bose–Einstein condensates ==
* A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a collection of boson atoms that are all in the same quantum state. In a thermodynamic system, the ground state becomes macroscopically occupied below a critical temperature — roughly when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is longer than the interatomic spacing. Superfluidity in liquid Helium-4 is believed to be associated with the Bose–Einstein condensation in an ideal gas. But 4He has strong interactions, and the liquid structure factor (a 2nd-order statistic) plays an important role. The use of a coherent state to represent the superfluid component of 4He provided a good estimate of the condensate / non-condensate fractions in superfluidity, consistent with results of slow neutron scattering. Most of the special superfluid properties follow directly from the use of a coherent state to represent the superfluid component — that acts as a macroscopically occupied single-body state with well-defined amplitude and phase over the entire volume. (The superfluid component of 4He goes from zero at the transition temperature to 100% at absolute zero. But the condensate fraction is about 6% at absolute zero temperature, T=0K.)
* Early in the study of superfluidity, Penrose and Onsager proposed a metric (&quot;order parameter&quot;) for superfluidity. It was represented by a macroscopic factored component (a macroscopic eigenvalue) in the first-order reduced density matrix. Later, C. N. Yang proposed a more generalized measure of macroscopic quantum coherence, called &quot;Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order&quot; (ODLRO), that included fermion as well as boson systems. ODLRO exists whenever there is a macroscopically large factored component (eigenvalue) in a reduced density matrix of any order. Superfluidity corresponds to a large factored component in the first-order reduced density matrix. (And, all higher order reduced density matrices behave similarly.) Superconductivity involves a large factored component in the 2nd-order (&quot;Cooper electron-pair&quot;) reduced density matrix.
* The reduced density matrices used to describe macroscopic quantum coherence in superfluids are formally the same as the correlation functions used to describe orders of coherence in radiation. Both are examples of macroscopic quantum coherence. The macroscopically large coherent component, plus noise, in the electromagnetic field, as given by Glauber&#x27;s description of signal-plus-noise, is formally the same as the macroscopically large superfluid component plus normal fluid component in the two-fluid model of superfluidity.
* Every-day electromagnetic radiation, such as radio and TV waves, is also an example of near coherent states (macroscopic quantum coherence). That should &quot;give one pause&quot; regarding the conventional demarcation between quantum and classical.
* The coherence in superfluidity should not be attributed to any subset of helium atoms; it is a kind of collective phenomena in which all the atoms are involved (similar to Cooper-pairing in superconductivity, as indicated in the next section).

== Coherent electron states in superconductivity ==
* Electrons are fermions, but when they pair up into Cooper pairs they act as bosons, and so can collectively form a coherent state at low temperatures. This pairing is not actually between electrons, but in the states available to the electrons moving in and out of those states. Cooper pairing refers to the first model for superconductivity.
* These coherent states are part of the explanation of effects such as the Quantum Hall effect in low-temperature superconducting semiconductors.

== Generalizations ==
* According to Gilmore and Perelomov, who showed it independently, the construction of coherent states may be seen as a problem in group theory, and thus coherent states may be associated to groups different from the Heisenberg group, which leads to the canonical coherent states discussed above. Moreover, these coherent states may be generalized to quantum groups. These topics, with references to original work, are discussed in detail in Coherent states in mathematical physics.

* In quantum field theory and string theory, a generalization of coherent states to the case where infinitely many degrees of freedom are used to define a vacuum state with a different vacuum expectation value from the original vacuum.
* In one-dimensional many-body quantum systems with fermionic degrees of freedom, low energy excited states can be approximated as coherent states of a bosonic field operator that creates particle-hole excitations. This approach is called bosonization.
* The Gaussian coherent states of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics can be generalized to &quot;relativistic coherent states&quot; of Klein-Gordon and Dirac particles.
* Coherent states have also appeared in works on loop quantum gravity or for the construction of (semi)classical canonical quantum general relativity.

<doc id="277215" wikidata="Q274177" url="?curid=277215" title="Flat-headed cat">
<text>The flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) is a small wild cat with short reddish-brown fur. Its head is elongated, and its ears are rounded. Its slender body is long with a tail of , and it weighs .

The flat-headed cat was first described in 1827 based on a zoological specimen collected in Sumatra. It is also native to the Thai-Malay Peninsula and Borneo, and inhabits wetlands like mixed freshwater swamp forests and lowland freshwater swamps near rivers and coastal areas. It preys foremost on fish, frogs and crustaceans.

The flat-headed cat is threatened by habitat destruction due to conversion for settlements, agriculture and oil palm plantations. It has been listed on the IUCN Red List as Endangered since 2008.

== Taxonomy ==
The scientific name &quot;Felis planiceps&quot; was proposed by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, who first described a skin of a flat-headed cat specimen collected in Sumatra. 
&quot;Prionailurus&quot; was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 as generic name for spotted wild cats native to Asia. He proposed the generic name &quot;Ictailurus&quot; for the flat-headed cat.

In 1951, Ellerman and Morrison-Scott grouped the flat-headed cat with the fishing cat (&quot;P. viverrinus&quot;), assuming it occurs in Lower Siam, Patani, the Malay States, Sumatra and Borneo. It was subordinated to the genus &quot;Prionailurus&quot; by Ingrid Weigel in 1961 who compared fur patterns of wild and domestic cats. It was grouped into &quot;Ictailurus&quot; in 1997 following a study on mitochondrial genes of cat species.
Today, it is still considered to be a &quot;Prionailurus&quot; species.

=== Phylogeny ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that their evolutionary radiation began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of Felidae species indicates a radiation at around .
Both models agree in the rusty-spotted cat (&quot;P. rubiginosus&quot;) having been the first cat of the &quot;Prionailurus&quot; lineage that genetically diverged, followed by the flat-headed cat and then the fishing cat. It is estimated to have diverged together with the leopard cat (&quot;P. bengalensis&quot;) between and .

The following cladogram shows their phylogenetic relationship as derived through analysis of nuclear DNA:

== Characteristics ==
The flat-headed cat is reddish-brown on top of the head, dark roan brown on the body with a mottled white underbelly. Its face is lighter in colour than the body, and its muzzle and chin are white. Two prominent buff whitish streaks run on either side of the nose between the eyes. It has rounded ears, and its eyes are set close together, giving it improved stereoscopic vision. The teeth together with well-muscled jaws facilitate catching and retaining slippery prey. The legs are fairly short, and the sheaths of its retractile claws are reduced in size so that about two-thirds are protruding. The depressed skull extends along the nose to the extremity of the muzzle, the sides of which are laterally distended. The head itself is lengthened and cylindrical, and the teeth are unusually long. The body is slender, and the extremities are delicate and lengthened.
The anterior upper premolars are larger and sharper relative to other cats. The interdigital webs on its paws help the cat gain better traction in muddy environments and water.

It has a head-and-body length of and a short tail of . It weighs .

== Distribution and habitat ==

The flat-headed cat&#x27;s distribution is restricted to lowland tropical rainforests in extreme southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo. It primarily inhabits freshwater habitats near coastal and lowland areas. More than 70% of records were collected less than away from water.

In peninsular Malaysia, flat-headed cats were recorded in Pasoh Forest Reserve in 2013 less than away from oil palm plantations. This detection suggests that the flat-headed cat is more tolerant of changes in its surrounding environment than previously assumed. As Pasoh Forest Reserve contains no major rivers or lakes and is generally covered by hill dipterocarp forest, this detection provides new evidence of the flat-headed cat&#x27;s potential habitat range. The reserve ranks as low probability of occurrence in a previously published species distribution model.

In Sumatra, flat-headed cats were recorded by camera traps on the Kampar Peninsula for the first time in 2015; until 2019, a total of 11 records were obtained in this peat swamp forest at an elevation of , and at most away from a river or canal.

In Kalimantan, flat-headed cats were recorded in mixed swamp forest and tall interior forest at elevations below in the vicinity of Sabangau National Park.
In Sarawak, a flat-headed cat was sighted and photographed on the bank of Maludam River in Maludam National Park in 2013. In Ulu Sebuyau National Park, flat-headed cats were recorded less than away from Sarawak River.

== Ecology and behavior ==

It is difficult to study the cat, which lives in thick vegetation in wet areas. Camera-trap photos are rare. Flat-headed cats recorded in Kalimantan were foremost active by night. They are presumably solitary, and probably maintain their home ranges by scent marking. In captivity, both females and males spray urine by walking forward in a crouching position, leaving a trail on the ground. Anecdotal historical accounts report that they are nocturnal, but an adult captive female was crepuscular and most active between 8:00 and 11:30 and between 18:00 and 22:00 hours.
The stomach contents of an adult shot on a Malaysian riverbank consisted only of fish. They have been observed to wash objects, raccoon-style. Live fish are readily taken, with full submergence of the head, and the fish were usually carried at least away, suggesting a feeding strategy to avoid letting aquatic prey escape back into water. Captive specimens show much greater interest in potential prey in the water than on dry land, suggesting a strong preference for riverine hunting in their natural habitat. Their morphological specializations suggest that their diet is mostly composed of fish, but they are reported to hunt for frogs, and are thought to catch crustaceans. They also catch rats and chickens.

Vocalizations of a flat-headed cat kitten resembled those of a domestic cat. The vocal repertoire of adults has not been analyzed completely, but they purr and give other short-ranged vocalizations.

Their gestation period lasts about 56 days. Of three litters recorded in captivity, one consisted of two kittens; the other two were singletons. Two captive individuals have lived for 14 years.

== Threats ==
The flat-headed cat is foremost threatened by destruction of wetlands and lowland forests, and environmental degradation. This habitat destruction is caused by conversion of natural habitats for settlements, plantations, agriculture and aquaculture, and clearing of mangroves. Overfishing in wetlands and expansion of oil palm plantations are considered to be significant threats. Incidental trapping is also a threat, as some flat-headed cats are reported to have been caught in traps set to protect domestic fowl. Collision with cars and competition with domestic cats could pose serious threats as well.

== Conservation ==
The flat-headed cat is included on CITES Appendix I. It is fully protected by national legislations in all range countries, with hunting and trade prohibited in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

=== In captivity ===
Songkhla Zoo kept three flat-headed cats as of 2017, which were all born in this zoo in 2009 by captive parents.

<text>The Coptic Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic particular Church in full communion with the Catholic Church. Along with the Ethiopian Catholic Church and Eritrean Catholic Church, it belongs to the Alexandrian liturgical tradition. Uniquely among the Alexandrian Rite Eastern Catholic liturgies, the Coptic Catholic Church uses the Coptic Rite and the Coptic language (derived from Ancient Egyptian) in its liturgy; the Ethiopian Catholic Church and Eritrean Catholic Church use the Ge&#x27;ez Rite.

The current Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria is Ibrahim Isaac Sidrak, who replaced Antonios Naguib in 2013. The offices of the patriarchate are located in Cairo. The patriarchal Cathedral of Our Lady of Egypt is in Nasr City, a suburb of Cairo.

== History ==
===Beginnings===

Since the Council of Chalcedon in the 5th century and the official separation of the Coptic Church from the Western Christian and Eastern Orthodox churches, the Catholic Church has attempted to achieve reunion with the Copts in Egypt many times. During the Council of Florence in 1442, the Coptic delegates present agreed to a reunion with the papacy in Rome, but the Coptic populace was opposed to the idea, and the union did not take effect. Further failed attempts at reunion were undertaken by Coptic delegates in 1560 and 1582.

In the 17th century, at the behest of Pope Urban VIII, Catholic missionaries (primarily Franciscans) started to come to Egypt. In 1630, a number of missions of the Capuchin Order were founded in the Levant by Joseph of Paris, including in Cairo. Although the mission in Cairo initially faced setbacks, tensions with the local Coptic priesthood were minimized with the arrival of Capuchin priest Agathangelo of Vendome to the city in 1633.

Initial relations between Catholics and Copts in Egypt were poor. One Coptic councilor in 1637 referred to the Roman Church in Egypt as &quot;a brothel&quot;. Attempts to excommunicate Catholic offenders in the city were seemingly fruitless. Agathangelo would later be hanged as a martyr in Ethiopia by order of the Ethiopian king in 1638, and the mission in Cairo would start to decline.
The Jesuits came in 1675.

In 1741, the Coptic bishop, Anba Athanasius of Jerusalem, became a Catholic. In 1781, he was appointed by Pope Benedict XIV as vicar apostolic of the fewer than 2,000 Egyptian Coptic Catholics. Eventually, Athanasius returned to the Coptic Orthodox Church and others served as Catholic vicar apostolic.

=== Patriarchate ===
Under the assumption that the Ottoman viceroy wanted a Catholic patriarch for the Coptic Catholics in 1824, the Pope established the Patriarchate of Alexandria from the Apostolic Vicariate of Syria, Egypt, Arabia and Cyprus but it was basically titular. The Ottomans in 1829 allowed the Coptic Catholics to build their own churches.

The number of Catholics of this rite increased to the point that Leo XIII in 1895 restored the Catholic patriarchate. He initially named Bishop Cyril Makarios as patriarchal vicar. Makarios then presided over a synod, which led to the introduction of some Latin practices. In 1899, Leo appointed Makarios as patriarch of Alexandria of the Copts, taking the name Cyril II. He resigned in 1908 at the request of the Pope over a controversy. The patriarchate seat remained vacant until an election in 1947 and was administered by an apostolic administrator.

== Hierarchy ==
The Coptic Catholic Church &quot;sui juris&quot; comprises a single ecclesiastical province, covering Egypt alone. The Patriarch is the sole metropolitan archbishop, retaining the ancient title Alexandria but his actual seat is in Egypt&#x27;s modern capital Cairo.

Coptic Catholic Church has eight suffragan bishops, throughout Egypt, comprising the only Coptic Catholic ecclesiastical province: Abu Qurqas, Alexandria (Patriarch&#x27;s original home seat), Assiut, Giza, Ismailia, Luxor, Minya and Sohag.
== Religious orders ==
The Coptic Catholic Church does not have Coptic monasteries. Instead the Church has religious congregations such as the three communities for women: the Sisters of the Sacred Heart, the Coptic Sisters of Jesus and Mary (both based in Egypt) and the Egyptian Province of the Little Sisters of Jesus. There is also a community of male Franciscans and Jesuits.

== Educational and health services ==
Most candidates for the priesthood are trained at , in suburban Cairo. More than 100 Coptic Catholic parishes administer primary schools, and some have secondary schools as well. The church maintains a hospital, a number of medical dispensaries and clinics, and several orphanages.

== Ecumenism ==
Relations between the Coptic Catholic Church and the larger Coptic Orthodox Church are generally very good.

<doc id="277226" wikidata="Q217438" url="?curid=277226" title="Demonym">
<text>A demonym (; ) or gentilic () is a word that identifies a group of people (inhabitants, residents, natives) in relation to a particular place. Demonyms are usually derived from the name of the place (hamlet, village, town, city, region, province, state, country, and continent). Demonyms are used to designate all people (the general population) of a particular place, regardless of ethnic, linguistic, religious or other cultural differences that may exist within the population of that place. Examples of demonyms include &quot;Cochabambino&quot;, for someone from the city of Cochabamba; Tunisian for a person from Tunisia; and &quot;Swahili&quot;, for a person of the Swahili coast.

Many demonyms function both endonymically and exonymically (used by the referents themselves or by outsiders); others function only in one of those ways.

As a sub-field of anthroponymy, the study of demonyms is called &quot;demonymy&quot; or &quot;demonymics&quot;.

Since they are referring to territorially defined groups of people, demonyms are semantically different from ethnonyms (names of ethnic groups). In the English language, there are many polysemic words that have several meanings (including demonymic and ethnonymic uses), and therefore a particular use of any such word depends on the context. For example, the word &quot;Thai&quot; may be used as a demonym, designating any inhabitant of Thailand, while the same word may also be used as an ethnonym, designating members of the Thai people. Conversely, some groups of people may be associated with multiple demonyms. For example, a native of the United Kingdom may be called a &quot;British person&quot;, a &quot;Briton&quot; or, informally, a &quot;Brit&quot;.

Some demonyms may have several meanings. For example, the demonym &quot;Macedonians&quot; may refer to the population of North Macedonia, or more generally to the entire population of the region of Macedonia, a portion of which is in Greece. In some languages, a demonym may be borrowed from another language as a nickname or descriptive adjective for a group of people: for example, &quot;Québécois&quot;, &quot;Québécoise (female)&quot; is commonly used in English for a native of the province or city of Quebec (though &quot;Quebecer&quot;, &quot;Quebecker&quot; are also available).

In English, demonyms are always capitalized.

Often, demonyms are the same as the adjectival form of the place, e.g. &quot;Egyptian&quot;, &quot;Japanese&quot;, or &quot;Greek&quot;. However, they are not necessarily the same, as exemplified by Spanish instead of Spaniard or British instead of Briton.

English commonly uses national demonyms such as &quot;Brazilian&quot; or &quot;Algerian&quot;, while the usage of local demonyms such as &quot;Chicagoan&quot;, &quot;Okie&quot; or &quot;Parisian&quot; is less common. Many local demonyms are rarely used and many places, especially smaller towns and cities, lack a commonly used and accepted demonym altogether.

==Etymology==
&quot;National Geographic&quot; attributes the term &quot;demonym&quot; to Merriam-Webster editor Paul Dickson in a work from 1990. The word did not appear for nouns, adjectives, and verbs derived from geographical names in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary nor in prominent style manuals such as the &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot;. It was subsequently popularized in this sense in 1997 by Dickson in his book &quot;Labels for Locals&quot;. However, in &quot;What Do You Call a Person From...? A Dictionary of Resident Names&quot; (the first edition of &quot;Labels for Locals&quot;) Dickson attributed the term to George H. Scheetz, in his &quot;Names&#x27; Names: A Descriptive and Prescriptive Onymicon&quot; (1988), which is apparently where the term first appears. The term may have been fashioned after &quot;demonymic&quot;, which the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines, as the name of an Athenian citizen according to the deme to which the citizen belongs, with its first use traced to 1893.

==Suffixation==
Several linguistic elements are used to create demonyms in the English language. The most common is to add a suffix to the end of the location name, slightly modified in some instances. These may resemble Late Latin, Semitic, Celtic, or Germanic suffixes, such as &quot;-(a)n&quot;, &quot;-ian&quot;, &quot;-anian&quot;, &quot;-nian&quot;, &quot;-in(e)&quot;, &quot;-a(ñ/n)o/a&quot;, &quot;-e(ñ/n)o/a&quot;, &quot;-i(ñ/n)o/a&quot;, &quot;-ite&quot;, &quot;-(e)r&quot;, &quot;-(i)sh&quot;, &quot;-ene&quot;, &quot;-ensian&quot;, &quot;-ard&quot;, &quot;-ese&quot;, &quot;-nese&quot;, &quot;-lese&quot;, &quot;-i(e)&quot;, &quot;-i(ya)&quot;, &quot;-iot&quot;, &quot;-iote&quot;, &quot;-k&quot;, &quot;-asque&quot;, &quot;-(we)gian&quot;, &quot;-onian&quot;, &quot;-vian&quot;, &quot;-ois(e)&quot;, or &quot;-ais(e)&quot;.

==Prefixation==
It is much rarer to find demonyms created with a prefix. Mostly they are from Africa and the Pacific, and are not generally known or used outside the country concerned. In much of East Africa, a person of a particular ethnic group will be denoted by a prefix. For example, a person of the Luba people would be a Muluba, the plural form Baluba, and the language, Kiluba or Tshiluba. Similar patterns with minor variations in the prefixes exist throughout on a tribal level. And Fijians who are indigenous Fijians are known as Kaiviti (Viti being the Fijian name for Fiji). On a country level:
*Botswana → Motswana (singular), Batswana (plural)
*Burundi → Umurundi (singular), Abarundi (plural)
*Eswatini → Liswati (singular), Emaswati (plural)
*Lesotho → Mosotho (singular), Basotho (plural)

==Non-standard examples==
Demonyms may also not conform to the underlying naming of a particular place, but instead arise out of historical or cultural particularities that become associated with its denizens. In the United States such demonyms frequently become associated with regional pride such as &quot;&quot;Burqueño&quot; and the feminine &quot;Burqueña&quot;&quot; of Albuquerque, or with the mascots of intercollegiate sports teams of the state university system, take for example the sooner of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Sooners.

==Ethnonyms==

Since names of places, regions and countries (toponyms) are morphologically often related to names of ethnic groups (ethnonyms), various ethnonyms may have similar, but not always identical, forms as terms for general population of those places, regions or countries (demonyms).

==Fiction==
Literature and science fiction have created a wealth of gentilics that are not directly associated with a cultural group. These will typically be formed using the standard models above. Examples include &quot;Martian&quot; for hypothetical people of Mars (credited to scientist Percival Lowell), &quot;Gondorian&quot; for the people of Tolkien&#x27;s fictional land of Gondor, and &quot;Atlantean&quot; for Plato&#x27;s island Atlantis.

Other science fiction examples include &quot;Jovian&quot; for those of Jupiter or its moons and &quot;Venusian&quot; for those of Venus. Fictional aliens refer to the inhabitants of Earth as &quot;Earthling&quot; (from the diminutive &quot;-ling&quot;, ultimately from Old English &quot;-ing&quot; meaning &quot;descendant&quot;), as well as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Terrene&quot;, &quot;Tellurian&quot;, &quot;Earther&quot;, &quot;Earthican&quot;, &quot;Terrestrial&quot;, and &quot;Solarian&quot; (from &quot;Sol&quot;, the sun).

Fantasy literature which involves other worlds or other lands also has a rich supply of gentilics. Examples include &quot;Lilliputians&quot; and &quot;Brobdingnagians&quot;, from the islands of Lilliput and Brobdingnag in the satire &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

In a few cases, where a linguistic background has been constructed, non-standard gentilics are formed (or the eponyms back-formed). Examples include Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Rohirrim&quot; (from Rohan), the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise&#x27;s &quot;Klingons&quot; (with various names for their homeworld), and the Sangheili from the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise, (also known as Elites in the game by humans, as well as players) named after their homeworld of Sanghelios.

<text>Buñol is a town and municipality in the province of Valencia, Spain. The municipality has an area of some 112 km2, and is situated approximately 38 km west of the provincial and autonomous community capital city, Valencia. It lies along the Buñol River and is surrounded by the mountain ranges &quot;La Sierra de Las Cabrillas&quot;, &quot;la Sierra de Dos Aguas&quot; and &quot;la Sierra de Malacara y Martés&quot;.

The local economic base is a mixture of the industrial and the agricultural (carob trees, almond trees, fruit trees, olive trees and grapes).

Buñol&#x27;s population is about 9,000 people.

Buñol has regional rail passenger service to Valencia via the Renfe system.

Every year upwards of 40,000 people gather in the town to throw over 115,000 kilograms of tomatoes at each other in the yearly &quot;La Tomatina&quot; festival. The festival is a popular sight, and many European tourists visit the town to participate in it.

Near the town are the training grounds and facilities of football club Levante UD.

<doc id="277231" wikidata="Q757257" url="?curid=277231" title="Hippeastrum">
<text>Hippeastrum () is a genus of 116 species, and over 600 hybrids and cultivars, of perennial, herbaceous and bulbous plants, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, from Mexico south to Argentina and on some islands in the Caribbean. The majority have large, fleshy bulbs and tall, broad, strap-like leaves that are (generally) evergreen, and large red or purple flowers. Numerous colors and cultivars have been created over the past hundred years.

&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; is a genus in the family Amaryllidaceae (subfamily Amaryllidoideae, tribe Hippeastreae, and subtribe Hippeastrinae). For many years, there has been confusion among botanists, as well as collectors and the general public, over the generic names &quot;Amaryllis&quot; and &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;; the former is a South African genus of plants, while the latter is a new world genus. However, the common name &quot;amaryllis&quot; has been used for &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; for years, especially for the ornamental cultivars (sold as indoor flowering bulbs around November and December, for Christmas, in the Northern Hemisphere). Within the genus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; exist many epiphytic species, as well, which may be found living in natural debris and leaf litter on the crooks of tree branches; by comparison, &quot;Amaryllis&quot; is a primarily terrestrial, southern African genus of perennial bulbs.

== Description ==

Most &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; bulbs are tunicate (a protective dry outer layer and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 5–12 cm (2&quot;–5&quot;) in diameter and produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 30–90 cm (12&quot;–36&quot;) long and 2.5–5 cm (1&quot;–2&quot;) wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile (borne directly from the stem or peduncle), rarely persistent and subpetiolate.

The flowers are arranged in umbelliform inflorescences which are pauciflor or pluriflor (2-14 flowers), supported on an erect hollow scape (flower stem) which is 20–75 cm (12&quot;–30&quot;) tall and 2.5–5 cm (1&quot;–2&quot;) in diameter with two free bracts forming a spathe which is bivalve with free leaflets at its base.
Depending on the species, there are two to fifteen large showy flowers, which are more or less zygomorphic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 13–20 cm (5&quot;–8&quot;) across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving downwards and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.

The androecium consists of six stamens with filiform (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is filiform, and the stigma trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which are dry, flattened, obliquely winged or irregularly discoid, hardly ever turgid, and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a brown or black phytomelanous testa.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; was first given to the genus by Herbert, being derived from the Ancient Greek, meaning a &quot;knight&#x27;s star&quot; from &quot;ἱππεύς&quot; (hippeus, mounted knight) and &quot;ἄστρον&quot; (, star), to describe the first recognized species, &quot;Hippeastrum reginae&quot;. Herbert proposed to call the genus, which he distinguished from Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;, or &quot;knight&#x27;s-star-lily&quot;. He states; &quot;I have named [them] &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; or Knights-star-lily, pursuing the idea which gave rise to the name Equestris&quot; (p.12).

Herbert&#x27;s fourteen species included this &quot;Hippeastrum equestre&quot;. This &#x27;equine&#x27; connection refers to Carl Linnaeus the Younger who had named (in an unpublished manuscript) a West Indian species as &quot;Amaryllis equestris&quot;, because of its similarity to the African genus &quot;Amaryllis&quot;. This name and attribution was first published by William Aiton in 1789, in his &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot;. Which species this was is not known precisely. However, in 1795 William Curtis, described &quot;Amaryllis equestris&quot; or the Barbados lily in his &quot;Botanical Magazine&quot;, referring to Aiton:

In 1803 John Sims claimed Curtis had made a mistake in this attribution, and that; &quot;this name was given from the remarkable likeness the front view of it has to a star of some of the orders of knight-hood; an appearance well expressed by JACQUIN&#x27;s figure in the &quot;Hortus Schoenbrunnensis&quot;&quot;

Despite much speculation, there is no definitive explanation of either Linnaeus &quot;fils&quot; or Herbert&#x27;s thinking. For instance the &#x27;knight&#x27;s star&#x27; has been compared to Linnaeus&#x27; decoration as a Knight of the Order of the Polar Star. The Latin word &quot;equestris&quot; (of a knight, or horseman) may have been confused with &quot;equi&quot; (of a horse), or possibly Herbert was making a literary knight&#x27;s move on the Linnaean term. The flower name has even been compared to the mediaeval weapon, the spoked mace or Morning Star which it superficially resembles.

===Common name===

Although the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus, the common name &quot;amaryllis&quot; continues to be used. Bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as ready to bloom for the holidays belong to the genus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;. &quot;Amaryllis&quot; is also used in the name of some societies devoted to the genus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;. Separate common names are used to describe the genus &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, e.g., &quot;Naked Lady&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

=== Separation of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; from &quot;Amaryllis&quot; ===
The taxonomy of the genus is complicated. The first issue is whether the name should more properly be &quot;Amaryllis&quot; . In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the name &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot;, the type species of the genus &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; along with eight other &quot;Amaryllis&quot; species. Linnaeus had earlier worked on the Estate of George Clifford near Haarlem between 1735 and 1737 describing the plants growing there in his &quot;Hortus Cliffortianus&quot; in 1738. It is to this work that he refers in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. This was assumed to be the South African Cape Belladonna, although not precisely known. Clifford&#x27;s herbarium is now preserved at the Natural History Museum in London.

At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in this same genus. By the early nineteenth century &quot;Amaryllis&quot; had become a polymorphic (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen genera today, and attempts were made to separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;, and only leaving three species in &quot;Amaryllis&quot;. The rest of the &quot;Amaryllis&quot; species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.

=== Nomenclature debate ===
Since then, a key question has been whether Linnaeus&#x27;s original type was a South African plant (now &quot;Amaryllis&quot;) or a South American plant (now &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;). If the latter, the correct name for the genus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; would then be &quot;Amaryllis&quot; and a new name would need to be found for the South African genus. In 1938 Johannes Cornelius Theodorus Uphof (JCT Uphof) claimed, with some evidence, that the plant was in fact the South American &quot;Hippeastrum equestre&quot; (syn. &quot;Amaryllis equestris&quot; (Linn. fil.) ex Aiton, accepted name &quot;H. puniceum&quot;) a plant which Carl Linnaeus&#x27; son, Linnaeus the Younger (&quot;Linn. fil.&quot;) had described c. 1781-3 (unpublished) but soon after appearing in the &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot; of 1789. This paper sparked a debate over the next half century, that delayed the official transfer of species from &quot;Amaryllis&quot; to &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;. This debate involved botanists on both sides of the Atlantic and the outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that &quot;Amaryllis&quot; should be a &quot;nomen conservandum&quot; (conserved name, i.e., correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; from the Clifford Herbarium. Thus &quot;Amaryllis&quot; is the correct name for the South African genus, not the South American genus (&quot;Hippeastrum&quot;).

=== Claim for &quot;Leopoldia&quot; ===
The second issue is whether the name should be &quot;Leopoldia&quot;. In 1819 Herbert had proposed &quot;Leopoldia&quot; as a &quot;nomen provisorium&quot; (provisional name) for the same taxon as he called &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; in 1821. Although &quot;Leopoldia&quot; was subsequently validated (i.e., became the correct name), this was overlooked, and &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; rather than &quot;Leopoldia&quot; was used for the genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name &quot;Leopoldia&quot; was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species, allied to &quot;Muscari&quot;. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; and &quot;Leopoldia&quot;, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; and Parlatore&#x27;s &quot;Leopoldia&quot; should be conserved and Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Leopoldia&quot; rejected. This was accepted and &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; is now a &quot;nomen conservandum&quot; (conserved name), &quot;i.e.,&quot; the correct name regardless of the fact that it does not have priority over &quot;Leopoldia&quot;.

===Intergeneric hybrids===
While interspecific hybrids of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; are relatively common, hybridization with other genera of Amaryllidaceae are more rare. The most conspicuous exception is the hybrid obtained through crossbreeding with the Mexican &quot;Sprekelia formosissima&quot; (St James&#x27;s lily, Aztec lily, Jacobean lily), another member of the tribe Hippeastreae, originally called &quot;Amaryllis formosissima&quot;, which is apomictic. &quot;× Hippeastrelia&quot; is the name given to this cross.

=== Subgenera ===
A number of subgenera have been proposed over the years. For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (number of species in parentheses) &quot;Habranthus&quot; (10), &quot;Phycella&quot; (3), &quot;Rhodophiala&quot; (5), &quot;Macropododastrum&quot; (1), &quot;Omphalissa&quot; (6), &quot;Aschamia&quot; (10) and &quot;Lais&quot; (3), some of which have since been treated as separate genera (&quot;Habranthus&quot;, &quot;Rhodophiala&quot;). Baker both reduced the original number of species of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as &quot;Habranthus&quot;, &quot;Phycella&quot;, &quot;Rhodophiala&quot; and &quot;Rhodolirion&quot; (also called &quot;Rhodolirium&quot;, and subsequently moved to &quot;Rhodophilia&quot;), which he included as separate sections of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;. In addition, he included many new species being discovered in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888. These subgenera were not widely used due to indistinct boundaries of some of the divisions. For reference, these were:
* &quot;Aschamia&quot; (e.g. &quot;H. reginae&quot;, &quot;H. andreanum&quot;, &quot;H. scopulorum&quot;, &quot;H. mandonii&quot;, &quot;H. leopoldii&quot;, &quot;H. reticulatum&quot;, &quot;H. stylosum&quot;)
* &quot;Cephaleon&quot; (e.g. &quot;H. machupijchense&quot;)
* &quot;Lais&quot; (e.g. &quot;H. striatum&quot;, &quot;H. vittatum&quot;, &quot;H. breviflorum&quot;)
* &quot;Macropodastrum&quot; (e.g. &quot;H. elegans&quot;)
* &quot;Omphalissa&quot; (e.g. &quot;H. aulicum&quot;, &quot;H. psittacinum&quot;, &quot;H. calyptratum&quot;, &quot;H. cybister&quot;, &quot;H. pardinum&quot;, &quot;H. miniatum&quot;, &quot;H. iguazuanum&quot;)
* &quot;Sealyana&quot; (e.g.: &quot;H. reticulatum&quot;)

Following a major recircumscription of Hippeastreae, &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; was once again formally divided into two subgenera, by the inclusion of the three species of &quot;Tocantina&quot;:
* &quot;Tocantinia&quot; (3)
* &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; (~100)

===Selected species===
, &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; accepts 116 species. Garcia et al. (2019) estimate approximately 100 species in subgenus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;, together with 3 in subgenus &quot;Tocantinia&quot;.
*&quot;Hippeastrum angustifolium&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum arboricola&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum aulicum&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum aviflorum&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum calyptratum&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum canterai&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum correiense&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum cybister&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum evansiae&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum ferreyrae&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum iguazuanum&quot;

*&quot;Hippeastrum reginae&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum striatum&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum reticulatum&quot; 
*&quot;Hippeastrum vittatum&quot; 
Unplaced names include &quot;Hippeastrum ugentii&quot;, considered in the Kew &quot;World Checklist of Selected Plant Families&quot; as probably a &quot;Crinum&quot;.

Hybrids include &quot;Hippeastrum ×johnsonii&quot;.
== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; species are concentrated in two centres of diversity, the main one in Eastern Brazil and the other in the central southern Andes of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, on the eastern slopes and nearby foothills. Some species are found as far north as Mexico and the West Indies. The genus is thought to have originated in Brazil where at least 34 of the species have been found. Their habitat is mainly tropical and subtropical, though those species found south of the equator, or at sufficient altitude may be considered temperate. &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; is found in a wide range of habitats. Many are found in underbrush, while others prefer full sun. &quot;Hippeastrum angustifolium&quot; is an example of a species preferring flood areas, while other species prefer a drier habitat. There are also epiphytic species, such as &quot;Hippeastrum aulicum&quot;, &quot;Hippeastrum calyptratum&quot;, &quot;Hippeastrum papilio&quot; and &quot;Hippeastrum arboricola&quot;, which require air circulation around their roots, which are in the subgenus &quot;Omphalissa&quot;.

== Ecology ==

=== Reproduction ===
Species are generally diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes, but some species, such as &quot;Hippeastrum iguazuanum&quot;, have 24. The genus has a degree of interspecies intercompatibility allowing crossing.

Some species, such as the Uruguayan &quot;Hippeastrum petiolatum&quot;, are sterile and unable to produce seeds. &quot;H. petiolatum&quot; is a sterile triploid that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried on the surface of water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as &quot;Hippeastrum reticulatum&quot; are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include hummingbirds in subtropical areas, and moths.

=== Pests ===
&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Spodoptera picta&quot; (crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (&quot;Eumerus strigatus&quot; and &quot;E. funeralis&quot;), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; is &quot;Stagonospora curtisii&quot; (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.

=== Conservation ===
The following species were considered threatened or vulnerable by degradation of their natural habitat, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species in 1997.

* &quot;Hippeastrum arboricolum&quot; (Argentina) 
* &quot;Hippeastrum aviflorum&quot; (Argentina) 
* &quot;Hippeastrum canterai&quot; (Uruguay) 
* &quot;Hippeastrum ferreyrae&quot; (Peru) 
* &quot;Hippeastrum petiolatum&quot; (Argentina &amp; Brazil)

== Cultivation ==

&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; cultivars and species can be grown inside in pots or outside in warmer climates (Hardiness 7B-11). Many will bloom year after year provided they are given a dormant period in a cool, dark place for two months without water or fertilizer although some bulbs will start growing before the two-month period is up.

The bulb is tender and should not be exposed to frost, but is otherwise easy to grow with large rewards for small efforts, especially those that bloom inside during the winter months. Note too, that &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; can also be grown in the ground in temperate areas. Bulbs are usually sold in fall for early winter bloom. Bare-root bulbs do best planted in a pot only slightly larger than the circumference of the bulb in well-drained, organic mix (such as sterilized potting soil plus coir fiber, or equal amounts of peat moss, sand and humus), with one third of the bulb visible above the surface of the soil and two thirds buried.

After planting, sprouting requires a warm place (about 20 °C). Bulbs need light watering until the leaves and buds emerge, and need to be situated in a well-lit, cool place and watered as needed to maintain moderate soil moisture. Overwatering will cause bulb and root rot. Plants may be fed with common fertilizers that contain iron and magnesium. Blooming takes place about two months after planting. The plant&#x27;s leaves should continue to grow after the flowers have faded. Summering outdoors in four or five hours of direct sunlight, plus fertilizing lightly as the season progresses, will help develop buds for the next year.

=== Breeding and propagation ===
Intense cultivation of a number of species, particularly from Brazil, Bolivia and Peru, has occurred because of the appearance and size of the flowers, resulting in many hybrids and cultivars.

=== History ===
&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; breeding began in 1799 when Arthur Johnson, a watchmaker in Prescot, England, crossed &quot;Hippeastrum reginae&quot; with &quot;Hippeastrum vitattum&quot;, obtaining hybrids that were later given the name &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; × &#x27;Johnsonii&#x27; (Johnson&#x27;s amaryllis, &#x27;hardy amaryllis&#x27; or St. Joseph&#x27;s lily). Johnson shared his work with the Liverpool Botanic Garden which was fortunate, since his greenhouse was destroyed in a fire. His hybrid was being cultivated in the US by the mid-nineteenth century. Many new hybrid lines followed as new species were sent to Europe from South America, the most important of which were &quot;Reginae&quot; and &quot;Leopoldii&quot;.

The &quot;Reginae&quot; strain hybrids were produced by Jan de Graaff and his two sons in the Netherlands in the mid-19th century by crossing &quot;Hippeastrum vitatum&quot; and &quot;Hippeastrum striatum&quot; with &quot;Hippeastrum psittacinum&quot; and some of the better hybrids available in Europe at the time. Some of the most successful hybrids were &quot;Graveana&quot; and &quot;Empress of India&quot;.

&quot;Leopoldii&quot; hybrids arose from the work of the British explorer and botanist Richard Pearce, an employee of James Veitch &amp; Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of &quot;Hippeastrum leopoldii&quot; and &quot;Hippeastrum pardinum&quot; from the Andes. These two species were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical. Crossing these two species with the best of the &quot;Reginae&quot; strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape. The Veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of &quot;Hippeastrum leopoldii&quot; and other varieties up to the early years of the twentieth century, the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development.

The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw Amaryllis breeding develop in the United States, particularly in Texas, California, and Florida in conjunction with the USDA (1910–1939). The major US contribution came from the work of Henry Nehrling and Theodore Mead, whose hybrids crossed with Dutch stock have produced some modern hybrids, although not matching the European strains.

In 1946, two Dutch growers moved to South Africa and began cultivation there. Although most cultivars of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; come from the Dutch and South African sources, bulbs are now [when?] being developed in the United States, Japan, Israel, India, Brazil and Australia. Nurseries may list Amaryllis bulbs as being &#x27;Dutch&#x27;, &#x27;Israeli&#x27;, &#x27;Peruvian&#x27; etc., depending on the country of origin.

Most modern commercial hybrids are derived from the following species:
* &quot;H. vittatum&quot; 
* &quot;H. leopoldii&quot; 
* &quot;H. pardinum&quot; 
* &quot;H. reginae&quot; 
* &quot;H. puniceum&quot; 
* &quot;H. aulicum&quot;

=== Propagation ===

Three main methods are used for propagating &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;: seeds, bulbils and &#x27;twin scales&#x27;. More recently [when?], micropropagation &quot;in vitro&quot; has been used on a commercial scale.

====Seeds====
The seeds are contained in a thin dark brown/black paper like fleche, that might easily blow away with some wind. Seed multiplication may be used for the development of new cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth, frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about six years to bloom.
====Bulbils====
Home propagation is best performed by using offset bulbils. Commercially, only cultivars that produce at least three bulbils on the mother bulb are used for this form of propagation. Plants grown from this method take three to four years to bloom.

====Twin scales====
The most common commercial propagation method is referred to as &#x27;twin scales&#x27;. This involves the division of the bulb into 12 sections and then separating each section into twin scales connected by the basal plate. The cuttings that are derived from these are grown in moist vermiculite in the dark till bulbils appear. More recently [when?] growing them in sunlight has been found to produce a better crop.

====In vitro====
The technique of plant tissue culture &quot;in vitro&quot; improves the propagation of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; by decreasing the time required to reach the minimum size to start the reproductive cycle, using sections of bulbs grown in artificial media with the addition of plant hormones.

=== Fragrance ===
Most modern cultivars lack any fragrance, although &#x27;Dancing Queen&#x27; represents an exception. Fragrance is genetically related to flower colour (white, or pastel shades) and is a recessive characteristic, so that when fragrant and non fragrant varieties are crossed, not all progeny will be fragrant, whereas two fragrant progenitors will produce an all fragrant progeny.

=== Flowering ===

&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; hybrids and cultivars are valued for their large ornamental flowers, particularly for indoor cultivation during the northern hemisphere winter. The larger the bulb, the more flowers it will produce. The largest bulbs measure 14 to 16 inches (36 to 41 cm) in circumference and will produce three or more scapes (flower stems) with four or more blooms each. The commonest bulbs measure to inches (27 to 32 cm) with two scapes with four to six flowers each depending on the cultivar. Some bulbs put up two flower scapes at the same time; others may wait several weeks between blooms and sometimes the second scape will have only two or three flowers rather than the usual four. A bulb needs to produce large, healthy leaves in the summer growing season before it can send up a scape the following year. Bulbs are often described by the country of origin of the bulb producers, since they may have different characteristics, e.g. &#x27;Dutch Amaryllis&#x27;, &#x27;South African Amarylllis&#x27;. Dutch bulbs usually produce flowers first, then, after they have finished blooming (hysteranthous), the plant will begin growing leaves. Bulbs from the South African growers usually put up a scape and leaves at the same time (synanthous).

Of the many hybrids, the best known are those producing flowers with red, pink, salmon, orange and white colors. Other flower colors include yellow and pale green with variations on these including multicoloring, with different colored mottling, stripes or edges on the petals. Some flowers have uniform colors or patterns on all six petals while others have more pronounced colors on the upper petals than on the lower ones.

Although many names are used to describe hybrids and cultivars, e.g., &#x27;Large Flowering&#x27;, &#x27;Dutch&#x27;, &#x27;Royal Dutch&#x27;, there are five types that are commonly sold;
* Single flower (large flowering)
* Double flower
* Miniature (dwarf, or small flowering)
* Trumpet
* Jumbo (mammoth)
&#x27;Trumpets&#x27;, as the name suggests, have flared, tube-shaped flowers. Single, double, and miniature bulbs are the ones typically sold by nurseries and other stores for the holidays in December and for St. Valentine’s Day and Easter.

Of the commercially available &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; species, sometimes sold as &#x27;exotic&#x27; amaryllis, &quot;Hippeastrum cybister&quot; has extremely thin petals often described as spider-like. The miniature evergreen &quot;Hippeastrum papilio&quot; or &quot;butterfly amaryllis&quot; whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.

===Dormancy===
&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; bulbs can be induced to rebloom yearly by mimicking the conditions in its natural environment (cool dry winters). When foliage starts to yellow, dormancy can be induced by withholding water and placing the plant in a cool dark place for six to ten weeks or until buds start to show. Even when plants are thriving outdoors in temperate climates, dormancy can be induced by withholding water and fertilizer in the northern hemisphere autumn, and bringing indoors to a cool environment prior to the first frost. Leaves will usually wither during this period and a flower stem begin to emerge after eight to ten weeks.

Bulbs can then be brought back into light, inspected for pests or rot, and repotted in fresh soil after cutting foliage to about above the bulb. Subsequent care is as for new bulbs, as described above. Best results are obtained by transplanting every three to four years.

=== Cultivars ===

The cultivar &#x27;Clown&#x27; (Double Galaxy Group) (white with red stripes) has received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Gallery===
== Uses ==
Cultivars of &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; are popular indoor ornamental plants prized for their large brightly colored flowers (including red, pink, salmon, orange and white). As such they have a very important place in the floriculture trade for sale as cut flowers or potted plants. Although the market is dominated by the Netherlands, and South Africa, other areas of production include Israel, Japan and the United States (Florida). Brazil also produces 17 million &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; bulbs annually.

&quot;Hippeastrum&quot; has yielded at least 64 isoquinoline alkaloids, which include anti-parasitic (e.g. candimine) and psychopharmacological activity due to their high alkaloid content. One alkaloid isolated from &quot;Hippeastrum vittatum&quot; (montanine) has demonstrated antidepressant, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties. &quot;Hippeastrum puniceum&quot; may also have therapeutic properties as it has been used in folk medicine to treat swellings and wounds.

== Symbolism ==

A stylized flower of a &quot;Hippeastrum&quot; cultivar (under its common name of amaryllis) is used internationally as a symbol for organizations associated with Huntington&#x27;s disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington&#x27;s disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth and development of the Huntington&#x27;s community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.

<doc id="277237" wikidata="Q339353" url="?curid=277237" title="Pumped-storage hydroelectricity">
<text>Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH), or pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing. 
A PSH system stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power.

Pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources (such as solar, wind, and other renewables) or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources (such as coal or nuclear) to be saved for periods of higher demand.
The reservoirs used with pumped storage can be quite small, when contrasted with the lakes of conventional hydroelectric plants of similar power capacity, and generating periods are often less than half a day.

The round-trip efficiency of PSH varies between 70% and 80%. Although the losses of the pumping process make the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand, when electricity prices are highest. If the upper lake collects significant rainfall, or is fed by a river, then the plant may be a net energy producer in the manner of a traditional hydroelectric plant.

Pumped storage is by far the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, and, , accounts for around 95% of all active storage installations worldwide, with a total installed throughput capacity of over 181 GW and as of 2020 a total installed storage capacity of over 1.6 TWh.

==Basic principle==

A pumped-storage hydroelectricity generally consists of two water reservoirs at different heights, connected with each other. 
At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the upper reservoir. 
When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating electricity. Pumped storage plants usually use reversible turbine/generator assemblies, which can act both as a pump and as a turbine generator (usually Francis turbine designs). 
Variable speed operation further optimizes the round trip efficiency in pumped hydro storage plants.
In micro-PSH applications, a group of pumps and Pump As Turbine (PAT) could be implemented respectively for pumping and generating phases. 
The same pump could be used in both modes by changing rotational direction and speed: the operation point in pumping usually differs from the operation point in PAT mode.

==Types==
In closed-loop systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows, while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river. Plants that do not use pumped storage are referred to as conventional hydroelectric plants; conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage if appropriately equipped.

==Economic efficiency==
Taking into account conversion losses and evaporation losses from the exposed water surface, energy recovery of 70–80% or more can be achieved. This technique is currently the most cost-effective means of storing large amounts of electrical energy, but capital costs and the necessity of appropriate geography are critical decision factors in selecting pumped-storage plant sites.

The relatively low energy density of pumped storage systems requires either large flows and/or large differences in height between reservoirs. The only way to store a significant amount of energy is by having a large body of water located relatively near, but as high as possible above, a second body of water. In some places this occurs naturally, in others one or both bodies of water were man-made. Projects in which both reservoirs are artificial and in which no natural inflows are involved with either reservoir are referred to as &quot;closed loop&quot; systems.

These systems may be economical because they flatten out load variations on the power grid, permitting thermal power stations such as coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants that provide base-load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency, while reducing the need for &quot;peaking&quot; power plants that use the same fuels as many base-load thermal plants, gas and oil, but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal efficiency. Hence pumped storage systems are crucial when coordinating large groups of heterogeneous generators. Capital costs for pumped-storage plants are relatively high, although this is somewhat mitigated by their proven long service life of decades - and in some cases over a century, which is three to five times longer than utility-scale batteries. When electricity prices become negative, pumped hydro operators may earn twice - when &quot;buying&quot; the electricity to pump the water to the upper reservoir at negative spot prices and again when selling the electricity at a later time when prices are high.

Along with energy management, pumped storage systems help stabilize electrical network frequency and provide reserve generation. Thermal plants are much less able to respond to sudden changes in electrical demand that potentially cause frequency and voltage instability. Pumped storage plants, like other hydroelectric plants, can respond to load changes within seconds.

The most important use for pumped storage has traditionally been to balance baseload powerplants, but they may also be used to abate the fluctuating output of intermittent energy sources. Pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand, enabling additional system peak capacity. In certain jurisdictions, electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it. Although at present this is rarely due to wind or solar power alone, increased use of such generation will increase the likelihood of those occurrences.

It is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large-scale photovoltaic and wind generation. Increased long-distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources. The high non-firm renewable electricity penetration in some regions supplies 40% of annual output, but 60% may be reached before additional storage is necessary.

=== Small-scale facilities ===
Smaller pumped storage plants cannot achieve the same economies of scale as larger ones, but some do exist, including a recent 13 MW project in Germany. Shell Energy has proposed a 5 MW project in Washington State. Some have proposed small pumped storage plants in buildings, although these are not yet economical. Also, it is difficult to fit large reservoirs into the urban landscape (and the fluctuating water level may make them unsuitable for recreational use). Nevertheless, some authors defend the technological simplicity and security of water supply as important externalities.

==Location requirements==
The main requirement for PSH is hilly country. The global greenfield pumped hydro atlas lists more than 800,000 potential sites around the world with combined storage of 86 million GWh (equivalent to the effective storage in about 2 trillion electric vehicle batteries), which is about 100 times more than needed to support 100% renewable electricity. Most are closed-loop systems away from rivers. Areas of natural beauty and new dams on rivers can be avoided because of the very large number of potential sites. Some projects utilise existing reservoirs (dubbed &quot;bluefield&quot;) such as the 350 Gigawatt-hour Snowy 2.0 scheme under construction in Australia. Some recently proposed projects propose to take advantage of &quot;brownfield&quot; locations such as disused mines such as the Kidston project under construction in Australia.

==Environmental impact==
Water requirements for PSH are small: about 1 gigalitre of initial fill water per gigawatt-hour of storage. This water is recycled uphill and back downhill between the two reservoirs for many decades, but evaporation losses (beyond what rainfall and any inflow from local waterways provide) must be replaced. Land requirements are also small: about 10 hectares per gigawatt-hour of storage, which is much smaller than the land occupied by the solar and windfarms that the storage might support. Closed loop (off-river) pumped hydro storage has the smallest carbon emissions per unit of storage of all candidates for large-scale energy storage.

== Potential technologies ==

===Seawater===
Pumped storage plants can operate with seawater, although there are additional challenges compared to using fresh water, such as saltwater corrosion and barnacle growth. Inaugurated in 1966, the 240 MW Rance tidal power station in France can partially work as a pumped-storage station. When high tides occur at off-peak hours, the turbines can be used to pump more seawater into the reservoir than the high tide would have naturally brought in. It is the only large-scale power plant of its kind.

In 1999, the 30 MW Yanbaru project in Okinawa was the first demonstration of seawater pumped storage. It has since been decommissioned. A 300 MW seawater-based Lanai Pumped Storage Project was considered for Lanai, Hawaii, and seawater-based projects have been proposed in Ireland. A pair of proposed projects in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile would use 600 MW of photovoltaic solar (Skies of Tarapacá) together with 300 MW of pumped storage (Mirror of Tarapacá) lifting seawater up a coastal cliff.

===Freshwater coastal reservoirs===
Freshwater from the river floods is stored in the sea area replacing seawater by constructing coastal reservoirs. The stored river water is pumped to uplands by constructing a series of embankment canals and pumped storage hydroelectric stations for the purpose of energy storage, irrigation, industrial, municipal, rejuvenation of overexploited rivers, etc. These multipurpose coastal reservoir projects offer massive pumped-storage hydroelectric potential to utilize variable and intermittent solar and wind power that are carbon-neutral, clean, and renewable energy sources.

===Underground reservoirs===
The use of underground reservoirs has been investigated. Recent examples include the proposed Summit project in Norton, Ohio, the proposed Maysville project in Kentucky (underground limestone mine), and the Mount Hope project in New Jersey, which was to have used a former iron mine as the lower reservoir. The proposed energy storage at the Callio site in Pyhäjärvi (Finland) would utilize the deepest base metal mine in Europe, with elevation difference. Several new underground pumped storage projects have been proposed. Cost-per-kilowatt estimates for these projects can be lower than for surface projects if they use existing underground mine space. There are limited opportunities involving suitable underground space, but the number of underground pumped storage opportunities may increase if abandoned coal mines prove suitable.

In Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, the Bendigo Sustainability Group has proposed the use of the old gold mines under Bendigo for Pumped Hydro Energy Storage. Bendigo has the greatest concentration of deep shaft hard rock mines anywhere in the world with over 5,000 shafts sunk under Bendigo in the second half of the 19th Century. The deepest shaft extends 1,406 metres vertically underground. A recent pre-feasibility study has shown the concept to be viable with a generation capacity of 30 MW and a run time of 6 hours using a water head of over 750 metres.

US-based start-up Quidnet Energy is exploring using abandoned oil and gas wells for pumped storage. If successful they hope to scale up, utilizing some of the 3 million abandoned wells in the US.

Using hydraulic fracturing pressure can be stored underground in impermeable strata such as shale. The shale used contains no hydrocarbons.

===Decentralised systems===
Small (or micro) applications for pumped storage could be built on streams and within infrastructures, such as drinking water networks and artificial snow-making infrastructures. In this regard, a storm-water basin has been concretely implemented as a cost-effective solution for a water reservoir in a micro-pumped hydro energy storage. Such plants provide distributed energy storage and distributed flexible electricity production and can contribute to the decentralized integration of intermittent renewable energy technologies, such as wind power and solar power. Reservoirs that can be used for small pumped-storage hydropower plants could include natural or artificial lakes, reservoirs within other structures such as irrigation, or unused portions of mines or underground military installations. In Switzerland one study suggested that the total installed capacity of small pumped-storage hydropower plants in 2011 could be increased by 3 to 9 times by providing adequate policy instruments.

Using a pumped-storage system of cisterns and small generators, pico hydro may also be effective for &quot;closed loop&quot; home energy generation systems.
===Underwater reservoirs===

In March 2017, the research project StEnSea (Storing Energy at Sea) announced their successful completion of a four-week test of a pumped storage underwater reservoir. In this configuration, a hollow sphere submerged and anchored at great depth acts as the lower reservoir, while the upper reservoir is the enclosing body of water. Electricity is created when water is let in via a reversible turbine integrated into the sphere. During off-peak hours, the turbine changes direction and pumps the water out again, using &quot;surplus&quot; electricity from the grid.

The quantity of power created when water is let in, grows proportionally to the height of the column of water above the sphere. In other words: the deeper the sphere is located, the more densely it can store energy.
As such, the energy storage capacity of the submerged reservoir is not governed by the gravitational energy in the traditional sense, but by the vertical pressure variation.

===High-density pumped hydro===
RheEnergise aim to improve the efficiency of pumped storage by using fluid 2.5x denser than water (&quot;a fine-milled suspended solid in water&quot;), such that &quot;projects can be 2.5x smaller for the same power.&quot;

== History ==

The first use of pumped storage was in 1907 in Switzerland, at the Engeweiher pumped storage facility near Schaffhausen, Switzerland. In the 1930s reversible hydroelectric turbines became available. This apparatus could operate both as turbine generators and in reverse as electric motor-driven pumps. The latest in large-scale engineering technology is variable speed machines for greater efficiency. These machines operate in synchronization with the network frequency when generating, but operate asynchronously (independent of the network frequency) when pumping.

The first use of pumped-storage in the United States was in 1930 by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company, using a large reservoir located near New Milford, Connecticut, pumping water from the Housatonic River to the storage reservoir above.

== Worldwide use ==

In 2009, world pumped storage generating capacity was 104 GW, while other sources claim 127 GW, which comprises the vast majority of all types of utility grade electric storage. 
The European Union had 38.3 GW net capacity (36.8% of world capacity) out of a total of 140 GW of hydropower and representing 5% of total net electrical capacity in the EU. 
Japan had 25.5 GW net capacity (24.5% of world capacity).

The six largest operational pumped-storage plants are listed below &quot;(for a detailed list see List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations)&quot;:

=== Australia ===
Australia has 15GW of pumped storage under construction or in development. 

Examples include:

* In June 2018, the Australian federal government announced that 14 sites had been identified in Tasmania for pumped storage hydro, with the potential of adding 4.8GW to the national grid if a second interconnector beneath Bass Strait was constructed.
* The Snowy 2.0 project will link two existing dams in the New South Wales&#x27; Snowy Mountains to provide 2 GW of capacity and 350 GWh of storage. The project is facing large challenges.
* In September 2022, a pumped hydroelectric storage (PHES) scheme was announced at Pioneer-Burdekin in central Queensland with the potential to be one of the largest PHES in the world at 2.5 — 5 GW / 120 GWh. When the project was cancelled in 2024, power price forecasts increased by 60% for 2035.

===China===
China has the largest capacity of pumped-storage hydroelectricity in the world.

In January 2019, the State Grid Corporation of China announced plans to invest US$5.7 billion in five pumped hydro storage plants with a total 6 GW capacity, to be located in Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, Shandong provinces, and in Xinjiang Autonomous Region. China is seeking to build 40 GW of pumped hydro capacity installed by 2020.

=== Norway ===
There are 9 power stations capable of pumping with a total installed capacity of 1344 MW and an average annual production of 2247 GWh. The pumped storage hydropower in Norway is built a bit differently from the rest of the world. They are designed for seasonal pumping. Most of them can also not cycle the water endlessly, but only pump and reuse once. The reason for this is the design of the tunnels and the elevation of lower and upper reservoirs. Some, like Nygard power station, pump water from several river intakes up to a reservoir.

The largest one, Saurdal, which is part of the Ulla-Førre complex, has four 160 MW Francis turbines, but only two are reversible. The lower reservoir is at a higher elevation than the station itself, and thus the water pumped up can only be used once before it has to flow to the next station, Kvilldal, further down the tunnel system. And in addition to the lower reservoir, it will receive water that can be pumped up from 23 river/stream and small reservoir intakes. Some of which will have already gone through a smaller power station on its way.

===United States===

In 2010, the United States had 21.5 GW of pumped storage generating capacity (20.6% of world capacity). 
PSH contributed 21,073 GWh of energy in 2020 in the United States, but −5,321 GWh (net) because more energy is consumed in pumping than is generated. Nameplate pumped storage capacity had grown to 21.6 GW by 2014, with pumped storage comprising 97% of grid-scale energy storage in the United States. As of late 2014, there were 51 active project proposals with a total of 39 GW of new nameplate capacity across all stages of the FERC licensing process for new pumped storage hydroelectric plants in the United States, but no new plants were currently under construction in the United States at the time.

===Italy===
Italy reached peak usage of pumped storage (&quot;pompaggi&quot;) in 2003, with about 8 TWh. For decades, Italy had excess capacity because its own nuclear program was interrupted in the 1980s, so pumping stations are mostly operated by night when France exports surplus nuclear electricity at near-zero prices. In 2019, the grid operator wanted 6 GW of extra capacity to be built in central and Southern Italy. In 2024, Edison planned 500 MW new capacity.

==Hybrid systems==
Conventional hydroelectric dams may also make use of pumped storage in a hybrid system that both generates power from water naturally flowing into the reservoir as well as storing water pumped back to the reservoir from below the dam. The Grand Coulee Dam in the United States was expanded with a pump-back system in 1973. Existing dams may be repowered with reversing turbines thereby extending the length of time the plant can operate at capacity. Optionally a pump back powerhouse such as the Russell Dam (1992) may be added to a dam for increased generating capacity. Making use of an existing dam&#x27;s upper reservoir and transmission system can expedite projects and reduce costs.

<text>Evagrius Scholasticus () was a Syrian scholar and intellectual living in the 6th century AD, and an aide to the patriarch Gregory of Antioch. His surviving work, &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (), comprises a six-volume collection concerning the Church&#x27;s history from the First Council of Ephesus (431) to the emperor Maurice’s reign until Scholasticus&#x27; death.

==Life==

Evagrius Scholasticus was born in Epiphania, a Syrian town located next to the Orontes River in the heart of the Eastern Roman Empire. Glenn Chesnut gives his date of birth as either 536 or 537; Michael Whitby says &quot;about 535&quot;. His first written work addressed the plague outbreak which infected a vast segment of the population. Evagrius himself was infected by the outbreak during his youth yet managed to survive it. According to his own account, close members of his family died from the outbreak, including his wife at the time. Michael Whitby reasons that Evagrius was born into a wealthy aristocratic family with close ties to the political elite.

His education was long-ranging and comprehensive since early childhood, starting with a specialization in grammar and transitioning to classical Greek literature. This eventually culminated in Evagrius’s pursuit of legal studies, which upon completion, earned him the prestigious title of “Scholasticus” when he was in his late 20s. His first notable official endeavor was accompanying Gregory of Antioch to Constantinople in order to defend him against charges related to sexual misbehavior. Evagrius again remarried in Antioch, where his own records testify to his prestige among the professional elite since displays of grandeur and a massive audience were present during this wedding ceremony. Dedicated to the emperor Maurice Evagrius wrote many works on theological matters, but none of these survives. His remaining work, &quot;The Ecclesiastical History&quot; was complete in 593, a six-volume compilation of Christian history from the first Council of Ephesus to his own present time.

Evagrius was explicitly a Christian in the Chalcedonian tradition, critiquing both Zacharias Rhetor and Zosimus for theological differences, two popular historians during his own time. He respected the former scholar for his contributions to the histories of the 5th and 6th centuries AD but chastised him for his Monophysite position. However, he was especially hostile towards Zosimus, a pagan historiographer, for his vehemently anti-Christian views, stating “ ‘You, O accursed and totally defiled one, say that the fortunes of the Romans wasted away and were altogether ruined from the time when Christianity was made known”, challenging Zosimus&#x27;s assumption that Rome&#x27;s fall began with Constantine&#x27;s conversion.

==Works==

===&quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;===

Evagrius&#x27;s only surviving work, &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, addresses the history of the Eastern Roman Empire from the official beginning of the Nestorian controversy at the First Council of Ephesus in 431 to the time in which he was writing, 593. The book&#x27;s contents focus mainly on religious matters, describing the events surrounding notable bishops and holy men.

The &quot;editio princeps&quot; was published in 1544 under the name of Robertus Stephanus (better known as Robert Estienne). John Christopherson, bishop of Chichester, made a Latin translation of the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, which was published after his death in 1570. Translations into English appeared much later: the first was by Edward Walford, which was published at London in 1846; Michael Whitby&#x27;s translation was published in 2001 by Liverpool University Press as part of their &quot;Texts in Translation Series.&quot;

Some historians, particularly Pauline Allen, allege that Evagrius&#x27;s Chalcedonian theological stance directly influenced his selection of information, in order to defend Chalcedonian-aligned political agents against negative reputation. Whitby, however, emphasizes the legal scholar&#x27;s acceptance and inclusion of information written by other historians who adopted opposing stances, when he discerned that their accounts were reliable. For example, Evagrius Scholasticus relies heavily on Zachariah&#x27;s textual study of history even though he was a monophysite, occasionally omitting minor facets of his work that explicitly promote his theology, but largely considering him to be dependable. Allen also reasons that Evagrius built on Zachariah&#x27;s work because his was the only comprehensive historical account of events taking place from Theodoret of Cyrus’s time till his own era. Unfortunately, however, Zachariah’s original manuscripts have been lost.

Evagrius is much less critical of the Emperor Justinian and his wife Theodora, in comparison with Procopius, who described the two as physically manifest demons. Because of regional affiliations Evagrius depicts the emperor in a more sympathetic light, praising his moderate approach to justice and his restraint towards excessive persecution, yet still decrying his heresy and displays of wealth. Evagrius’s ambivalence to Justinian is especially evident when he describes him as a virtuous man yet blind to impending defeat in his self-initiated war with Persia. Chesnut also comments on how the Roman historian and scholar endues his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; with a dramatic style, using themes from classical Greek tragedies to characterize Justinian’s life, particularly Fortune’s grand fluctuations.

Evagrius builds upon the documents written by Zachariah, Symeon Stylites the Elder, Eustathius of Epiphania, John Malalas, Zosimus, and Procopius of Caesarea.

&quot;The Ecclesiastical History&quot; is considered an important and relatively authoritative account of the timeline it traces, since Evagrius draws on other scholars’ material, explicitly acknowledging his sources. He meticulously organizes information taken from other written historical works in order to validate his account more effectively than other theological scholars of his time, thus diminishing confusion for future historian&#x27;s interested in studying his work. However, historians acknowledge that there are serious logical errors inherent in Evagrius&#x27;s surviving work, which is common for its epoch, namely the problematic chronological sequencing and skimming over of undeniably notable events such as major wars and other secular events. When the scholar mentions important occasions in his own life, lack of chronological labeling is especially evident – which can provide complications to those analyzing his book.

Calvin &quot;Cal&quot; Smith, who recruited Woolery to the M&amp;A practice, has acted for clients such as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in its $1.8 billion sale to Restaurant Brands International and Energizer in its $2 billion acquisition of the Rayovac and VARTA battery brands from Spectrum Brands.

The firm provided Guantanamo Bay attorneys for six Yemeni detainees, including Mohammed Al-Adahi. The firm was appointed as independent counsel to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, following allegations of war crimes against the country&#x27;s former president, and undertook litigation and research assistance for the prosecutor&#x27;s office in the U.N.-assisted Khmer Rouge Tribunal.

=== Impact on the City of Atlanta and the State of Georgia ===
The firm played a pivotal role in the creation of the largest bank holding company in Georgia, The Trust Company of Georgia (now known as SunTrust Banks), as the firm&#x27;s first M&amp;A lawyers, including Hughes Spalding, advised early predecessors of The Trust Company of Georgia in transformative corporate reorganizations and combinations with other regional banking institutions, including the separation of Trust Company of Georgia from Atlanta National Bank and Lowry National Bank shortly following revisions to the law under the 1933 Banking Act and the merger of Trust Company of Georgia with Sun Banks in 1985. The combined bank later merged with Third National in Tennessee, Crestar in Virginia, and National Commerce Bank in Memphis, Tennessee and North Carolina.

In 1995, King &amp; Spalding lawyers, led by partner Horace Sibley, advised the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, which staged the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. King &amp; Spalding personnel in Atlanta raised more than $930,000 in support of United Way in 2018. In the 1800s, the King &amp; Spalding firm incorporated and filed the charter documents of the Piedmont Driving Club. In 2006, former K&amp;S partner Joseph Bankoff was unanimously appointed Chief Executive Officer of Atlanta&#x27;s Woodruff Arts Center. A team of partners from the firm&#x27;s Corporate, Finance &amp; Investments team put together documentation to construct, brand, market and operate the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The same King &amp; Spalding team represented the City of Atlanta in its winning bid to host Super Bowl LIII in 2019. In 2014, Atlanta M&amp;A partner Mike Egan advised Arthur Blank in the expansion of the Atlanta United FC. In 2015, Atlanta M&amp;A partner Rahul Patel advised certain investors in the Atlanta Hawks NBA basketball franchise in a recapitalization transaction involving Grant Hill, Sarah Blakely and Jesse Itzler. In 2005, Egan and Atlanta M&amp;A partner Ray Baltz represented Atlanta Spirit LLC in its acquisition of the Atlanta Hawks, Atlanta Thrashers and the operating rights to Philips Arena in a transaction valued at $241 million. Corporate lawyers from King &amp; Spalding have also represented the investors and the management team of the BB&amp;T Atlanta Open, an ATP World Tour 250 tennis championship held annually in Midtown Atlanta. The firm maintains close ties to the University of Georgia School of Law, which is home to the Alexander Campbell King Law Library; former K&amp;S partner Mike Raeber serves as the University&#x27;s general counsel, and several of its law professors were former King &amp; Spalding associates.

===Defense of the Defense of Marriage Act===
In April 2011, the firm signed a $500,000 contract with the Republican-controlled United States House of Representatives to take on the case of defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage in federal law as the union between one man and one woman, in court for the House, with partner (and former Solicitor General) Paul Clement as its lead attorney. After the contract was signed, the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign announced it would launch a publicity war to &quot;shame&quot; the firm and planned protest, ads in legal publications, and to try to influence students and potential clients dealings with the firm. Soon after signing, the firm asked to withdraw from the case after facing criticism from gay rights groups, citing an &quot;inadequate&quot; vetting process. Clement immediately resigned from the firm, writing in a letter to King &amp; Spalding Chairman Robert Hays, &quot;I resign out of the firmly-held belief that a representation should not be abandoned because the client&#x27;s legal position is extremely unpopular in certain quarters. Defending unpopular decisions is what lawyers do...Efforts to delegitimize any representation for one side of a legal controversy are a profound threat to the rule of law.&quot; He added, &quot;If there were problems with the firm&#x27;s vetting process, we should fix the vetting process, not drop the representation.&quot; Clement immediately joined Bancroft PLLC, which took the case. &quot;The National Law Journal&quot; wrote that the event &quot;leaves unanswered a myriad of questions about the status of Clement&#x27;s other cases and clients, and the future of King &amp; Spalding&#x27;s D.C. appellate practice, which was built around Clement.&quot;

The firm was criticized by those in the legal community on both sides of the same-sex marriage issue for the decision; Attorney General of the United States Eric Holder compared the situation to the criticism of lawyers tasked with defending Guantanamo Bay detainees, saying, &quot;It was something we dealt with here in the Department of Justice...The people who criticized our people here at the Justice Department were wrong then as are people who criticized Paul Clement for the representation that he&#x27;s going to continue.&quot; Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said, &quot;Although lawyers are not obligated in the first instance to take all comers, they are very much obligated not to quit in the face of criticism once they do take on a client. This is a bad message to send to lawyers and to clients.&quot; The decision shocked those lawyers involved in Supreme Court cases. Speaker of the House John Boehner issued a statement condemning the firm&#x27;s &quot;careless disregard for its responsibilities to the House in this constitutional matter.&quot; Theodore Olson, Clement&#x27;s predecessor as Solicitor General and a same-sex marriage supporter, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know of anything comparable to this. You have to be willing to stand your ground.&quot;

&quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; reported that Coca-Cola &quot;directly intervened to press the firm to extricate itself from the case.&quot;

After King &amp; Spalding dropped the case, Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli terminated his office&#x27;s relationship with the firm, writing in a letter to the firm that their &quot;willingness to drop a client, the U.S. House of Representatives, in connection with the lawsuit challenging the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was such an obsequious act of weakness that I feel compelled to end your legal association with Virginia so that there is no chance that one of my legal clients will be put in the embarrassing and difficult situation like the client you walked away from, the House of Representatives.&quot; The National Rifle Association of America soon did the same.

===Participation in Trump administration election lawsuits===
In the immediate aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, King &amp; Spalding was criticized for choosing to represent the Trump campaign in a lawsuit in North Carolina seeking to block the state from implementing a rule allowing an extension for the receipt of mail-in ballots. Protesters gathered outside the firm&#x27;s D.C. office on November 13. Protesters including Eliza Orlins, a public defender and candidate for Manhattan district attorney, and others characterized the election lawsuits by King &amp; Spalding, Jones Day, Porter Wright Morris &amp; Arthur LLP, and other law firms as frivolous, highly unlikely to overturn the election result, and damaging to the integrity of American democracy. As it turned out, Trump won North Carolina, making further proceedings by King &amp; Spalding on his behalf in the state moot.

<doc id="277246" wikidata="Q1754114" url="?curid=277246" title="Schiltron">
<text>A schiltron (also spelled sheltron, sceld-trome, schiltrom, or shiltron) is a compact body of troops forming a battle array, shield wall or phalanx. The term is most often associated with Scottish pike formations during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.

== Etymology ==
The term dates from at least 1000 AD and derives from Old English roots expressing the idea of a &quot;shield-troop&quot;. Some researchers have also posited this etymological relation may show the schiltron is directly descended from the Anglo-Saxon shield wall, and still others give evidence &quot;schiltron&quot; is a name derived from a Viking circular formation (generally no fewer than a thousand fighters) in extremely close formation, intended to present an enemy&#x27;s cavalry charge with an &quot;infinite&quot; obstacle (that is, a perimeter horses refuse to breach). Matters are confused by use of this term in Middle English to clearly refer to a body of soldiers without reference to formation, including cavalry and archers. The first mention of the schiltron as a specific formation of spearmen appears to be at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. There is, however, no reason to believe this is the first time such a formation was used and it may have had a long previous history in Scotland, as the Picts used to employ spears in block formation as the backbone of their armies.

==Examples of the formation==

There are two recorded Scottish instances of circular schiltrons: William Wallace&#x27;s army at the 1298 Battle of Falkirk, and an element of Thomas Randolph&#x27;s forces on the first day of the 1314 Battle of Bannockburn.

The circular formation is essentially static. At Falkirk, the formation was fortified by driving stakes into the ground before the men, with ropes between. Charles Oman describes the formation thus: &quot;The front ranks knelt with their spear butts fixed in the earth; the rear ranks leveled their lances over their comrades heads; the thick-set grove of twelve foot spears was far too dense for the cavalry to penetrate.&quot;

===Rectilinear schiltrons===
There are numerous accounts of rectilinear schiltrons – they were employed at the battles of Glen Trool (1307), Bannockburn (the main battle), Myton (1319), Dupplin Muir (1332), Culblean (1335), Halidon Hill (1333), Neville&#x27;s Cross (1346) and Otterburn (1388).

Unlike the circular schiltron, the rectilinear formation was capable of both defensive and offensive action. The offensive use of the schiltron is a tactical development credited to Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn. He had drilled his troops in the offensive use of the pike (requiring great discipline) and he was able to fight the English forces on flat, firm ground suitable for their large force of cavalry. Bruce&#x27;s new tactic was a response to a crushing defeat for the Scots at Falkirk when the first recorded use of the schiltron by a Scottish army failed in the face of a combination of conscripted Welsh longbowmen, English archers and English cavalry.

Detailed descriptions of the formation are rare but those given by English chroniclers of Bannockburn demonstrate the essential features:
*&quot;They had axes at their sides and lances in their hands. They advanced like a thick-set hedge and such a phalanx could not easily be broken.&quot;
*&quot;They were all on foot; picked men they were, enthusiastic, armed with keen axes, and other weapons, and with their shields closely locked in front of them, they formed an impenetrable phalanx ...&quot;

===English examples===

The term schiltron is also used by Barbour to describe English infantry at Bannockburn. It is also used by the author of the Lanercost Chronicle to describe the English spearmen at the Battle of Boroughbridge (1322). In both cases, a rectilinear formation is being described, though that at Boroughbridge is curved, with its flanks bent back.

==European parallels==
While doubtless a Scottish development, the schiltron fits into a Northern European context of infantry combat. Parallels with Scandinavian practice have already been drawn (see Etymology above) and the multiple-ranked tightly packed infantry formations were standard across Europe during the Middle Ages.

Schiltron-like formations were also used by the Welsh troops at the battles of Orewin Bridge (1282) and Maes Moydog (1295), although this tactic was generally unsuccessful for the Welsh.

Perhaps the closest parallel is with the armies of medieval Flanders. Here too can be seen the deep blocks of fighting men, with rows of spears braced in the earth to resist cavalry. The greatest of their battles was possibly Courtrai in 1302, where the Flemings destroyed a French army of knights and foot-soldiers. The Flemings also made great use of a circular &quot;crown-shaped&quot; formation, similar to those used at Falkirk and Bannockburn.

A similar square formation (&quot;formação em quadrado&quot;) of pike-armed foot soldiers was used by the English-assisted Portuguese troops against Castilian armies in the late 14th century at Aljubarrota (1385).

Another example is during the Battle of Legnano (1176) between the Milanese Army against Federico Barbarossa, in defense of the Carroccio by the Milanese armies commanded by Guido da Landriano.

<text>In a blind or blinded experiment, information which may influence the participants of the experiment is withheld until after the experiment is complete. Good blinding can reduce or eliminate experimental biases that arise from a participants&#x27; expectations, observer&#x27;s effect on the participants, observer bias, confirmation bias, and other sources. A blind can be imposed on any participant of an experiment, including subjects, researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. In some cases, while blinding would be useful, it is impossible or unethical. For example, it is not possible to blind a patient to their treatment in a physical therapy intervention. A good clinical protocol ensures that blinding is as effective as possible within ethical and practical constraints.

During the course of an experiment, a participant becomes unblinded if they deduce or otherwise obtain information that has been masked to them. For example, a patient who experiences a side effect may correctly guess their treatment, becoming unblinded. Unblinding is common in blinded experiments, particularly in pharmacological trials. In particular, trials on pain medication and antidepressants are poorly blinded. Unblinding that occurs before the conclusion of a study is a source of experimental error, as the bias that was eliminated by blinding is re-introduced. The CONSORT reporting guidelines recommend that all studies assess and report unblinding. In practice, very few studies do so.

Blinding is an important tool of the scientific method, and is used in many fields of research. In some fields, such as medicine, it is considered essential. In clinical research, a trial that is not a blinded trial is called an open trial.

==History==
The first known blind experiment was conducted by the French Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism in 1784 to investigate the claims of mesmerism as proposed by Charles d&#x27;Eslon, a former associate of Franz Mesmer. In the investigations, the researchers (physically) blindfolded mesmerists and asked them to identify objects that the experimenters had previously filled with &quot;vital fluid&quot;. The subjects were unable to do so.

In 1817, the first blind experiment recorded to have occurred outside of a scientific setting compared the musical quality of a Stradivarius violin to one with a guitar-like design. A violinist played each instrument while a committee of scientists and musicians listened from another room so as to avoid prejudice.

An early example of a double-blind protocol was the Nuremberg salt test of 1835 performed by Friedrich Wilhelm von Hoven, Nuremberg&#x27;s highest-ranking public health official, as well as a close friend of Friedrich Schiller. This trial contested the effectiveness of homeopathic dilution.

In 1865, Claude Bernard published his &quot;Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine&quot;, which advocated for the blinding of researchers. Bernard&#x27;s recommendation that an experiment&#x27;s observer should not know the hypothesis being tested contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist. The first study recorded to have a blinded researcher was conducted in 1907 by W. H. R. Rivers and H. N. Webber to investigate the effects of caffeine. The need to blind researchers became widely recognized in the mid-20th century.

== Background ==
=== Bias ===
A number of biases are present when a study is insufficiently blinded. Patient-reported outcomes can be different if the patient is not blinded to their treatment. Likewise, failure to blind researchers results in observer bias. Unblinded data analysts may favor an analysis that supports their existing beliefs (confirmation bias). These biases are typically the result of subconscious influences, and are present even when study participants believe they are not influenced by them.

=== Terminology ===

In medical research, the terms &quot;single-blind&quot;, &quot;double-blind&quot; and &quot;triple-blind&quot; are commonly used to describe blinding. These terms describe experiments in which (respectively) one, two, or three parties are blinded to some information. Most often, single-blind studies blind patients to their treatment allocation, double-blind studies blind both patients and researchers to treatment allocations, and triple-blinded studies blind patients, researcher, and some other third party (such as a monitoring committee) to treatment allocations. However, the meaning of these terms can vary from study to study.

CONSORT guidelines state that these terms should no longer be used because they are ambiguous. For instance, &quot;double-blind&quot; could mean that the data analysts and patients were blinded; or the patients and outcome assessors were blinded; or the patients and people offering the intervention were blinded, etc. The terms also fail to convey the information that was masked and the amount of unblinding that occurred. It is not sufficient to specify the number of parties that have been blinded. To describe an experiment&#x27;s blinding, it is necessary to report &quot;who&quot; has been blinded to &quot;what&quot; information, and &quot;how well&quot; each blind succeeded.

==Unblinding==
&quot;Unblinding&quot; occurs in a blinded experiment when information becomes available to one from whom it has been masked. In clinical studies, unblinding may occur unintentionally when a patient deduces their treatment group. Unblinding that occurs before the conclusion of an experiment is a source of bias. Some degree of premature unblinding is common in blinded experiments. When a blind is imperfect, its success is judged on a spectrum with no blind (or complete failure of blinding) on one end, perfect blinding on the other, and poor or good blinding between. Thus, the common view of studies as blinded or unblinded is an example of a false dichotomy.

Success of blinding is assessed by questioning study participants about information that has been masked to them (e.g. did the participant receive the drug or placebo?). In a perfectly blinded experiment, the responses should be consistent with no knowledge of the masked information. However, if unblinding has occurred, the responses will indicate the degree of unblinding. Since unblinding cannot be measured directly, but must be inferred from participants&#x27; responses, its measured value will depend on the nature of the questions asked. As a result, it is not possible to measure unblinding in a way that is completely objective. Nonetheless, it is still possible to make informed judgments about the quality of a blind. Poorly blinded studies rank above unblinded studies and below well-blinded studies in the hierarchy of evidence.

===Post-study unblinding===
Post-study unblinding is the release of masked data upon completion of a study. In clinical studies, post-study unblinding serves to inform subjects of their treatment allocation. Removing a blind upon completion of a study is never mandatory, but is typically performed as a courtesy to study participants. Unblinding that occurs after the conclusion of a study is not a source of bias, because data collection and analysis are both complete at this time.

===Premature unblinding===
Premature unblinding is any unblinding that occurs before the conclusion of a study. In contrast with post-study unblinding, premature unblinding is a source of bias. A code-break procedure dictates when a subject should be unblinded prematurely. A code-break procedure should only allow for unblinding in cases of emergency. Unblinding that occurs in compliance with code-break procedure is strictly documented and reported.

Premature unblinding may also occur when a participant infers from experimental conditions information that has been masked to them. A common cause for unblinding is the presence of side effects (or effects) in the treatment group. In pharmacological trials, premature unblinding can be reduced with the use of an active placebo, which conceals treatment allocation by ensuring the presence of side effects in both groups. However, side effects are not the only cause of unblinding; any perceptible difference between the treatment and control groups can contribute to premature unblinding.

A problem arises in the assessment of blinding because asking subjects to guess masked information may prompt them to try to infer that information. Researchers speculate that this may contribute to premature unblinding. Furthermore, it has been reported that some subjects of clinical trials attempt to determine if they have received an active treatment by gathering information on social media and message boards. While researchers counsel patients not to use social media to discuss clinical trials, their accounts are not monitored. This behavior is believed to be a source of unblinding. CONSORT standards and good clinical practice guidelines recommend the reporting of all premature unblinding. In practice, unintentional unblinding is rarely reported.

===Significance===
Bias due to poor blinding tends to favor the experimental group, resulting in inflated effect size and risk of false positives. Success or failure of blinding is rarely reported or measured; it is implicitly assumed that experiments reported as &quot;blind&quot; are truly blind. Critics have pointed out that without assessment and reporting, there is no way to know if a blind succeeded. This shortcoming is especially concerning given that even a small error in blinding can produce a statistically significant result in the absence of any real difference between test groups when a study is sufficiently powered (i.e. statistical significance is not robust to bias). As such, many statistically significant results in randomized controlled trials may be caused by error in blinding. Some researchers have called for the mandatory assessment of blinding efficacy in clinical trials.

==Applications==

===In medicine===
Blinding is considered essential in medicine, but is often difficult to achieve. For example, it is difficult to compare surgical and non-surgical interventions in blind trials. In some cases, sham surgery may be necessary for the blinding process. A good clinical protocol ensures that blinding is as effective as possible within ethical and practical constrains.

Studies of blinded pharmacological trials across widely varying domains find evidence of high levels of unblinding. Unblinding has been shown to affect both patients and clinicians. This evidence challenges the common assumption that blinding is highly effective in pharmacological trials. Unblinding has also been documented in clinical trials outside of pharmacology.

====Pain====

A 2018 meta-analysis found that assessment of blinding was reported in only 23 out of 408 randomized controlled trials for chronic pain (5.6%). The study concluded upon analysis of pooled data that the overall quality of the blinding was poor, and the blinding was &quot;not successful.&quot; Additionally, both pharmaceutical sponsorship and the presence of side effects were associated with lower rates of reporting assessment of blinding.

====Depression====

Studies have found evidence of extensive unblinding in antidepressant trials: at least three-quarters of patients were able to correctly guess their treatment assignment. Unblinding also occurs in clinicians. Better blinding of patients and clinicians reduces effect size. Researchers concluded that unblinding inflates effect size in antidepressant trials. Some researchers believe that antidepressants are not effective for the treatment of depression and only outperform placebos due to systematic error. These researchers argue that antidepressants are just active placebos.

====Acupuncture====

While the possibility of blinded trials on acupuncture is controversial, a 2003 review of 47 randomized controlled trials found no fewer than four methods of blinding patients to acupuncture treatment: 1) superficial needling of true acupuncture points, 2) use of acupuncture points which are not indicated for the condition being treated, 3) insertion of needles outside of true acupuncture points, and 4) the use of placebo needles which are designed not to penetrate the skin. The authors concluded that there was &quot;no clear association between type of sham intervention used and the results of the trials.&quot;

A 2018 study on acupuncture which used needles that did not penetrate the skin as a sham treatment found that 68% of patients and 83% of acupuncturists correctly identified their group allocation. The authors concluded that the blinding had failed, but that more advanced placebos may someday offer the possibility of well-blinded studies in acupuncture.

===In physics===

It is standard practice in physics to perform blinded data analysis. After data analysis is complete, one is allowed to unblind the data. A prior agreement to publish the data regardless of the results of the analysis may be made to prevent publication bias.

===In social sciences===

Social science research is particularly prone to observer bias, so it is important in these fields to properly blind the researchers. In some cases, while blind experiments would be useful, they are impractical or unethical. Blinded data analysis can reduce bias, but is rarely used in social science research.

===In forensics===
In a police photo lineup, an officer shows a group of photos to a witness and asks the witness to identify the individual who committed the crime. Since the officer is typically aware of who the suspect is, they may (subconsciously or consciously) influence the witness to choose the individual that they believe committed the crime. There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos to the witness does not know who the suspect is.

===In music===

Auditions for symphony orchestras take place behind a curtain so that the judges cannot see the performer. Blinding the judges to the gender of the performers has been shown to increase the hiring of women. Blind tests can also be used to compare the quality of musical instruments.

<doc id="277251" wikidata="Q846619" url="?curid=277251" title="Stored procedure">
<text>A stored procedure (also termed prc, proc, storp, sproc, StoPro, StoredProc, StoreProc, sp, or SP) is a subroutine available to applications that access a relational database management system (RDBMS). Such procedures are stored in the database data dictionary.

Uses for stored procedures include data-validation (integrated into the database) or access-control mechanisms. Furthermore, stored procedures can consolidate and centralize logic that was originally implemented in applications. To save time and memory, extensive or complex processing that requires execution of several SQL statements can be saved into stored procedures, and all applications call the procedures. One can use nested stored procedures by executing one stored procedure from within another.

Stored procedures may return result sets, i.e., the results of a codice_1 statement. Such result sets can be processed using cursors, by other stored procedures, by associating a result-set locator, or by applications. Stored procedures may also contain declared variables for processing data and cursors that allow it to loop through multiple rows in a table. Stored-procedure flow-control statements typically include codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, and codice_6 statements, and more. Stored procedures can receive variables, return results or modify variables and return them, depending on how and where the variable is declared.

== Implementation ==
Stored procedures are similar to user-defined functions (UDFs). The major difference is that UDFs can be used like any other expression within SQL statements, whereas stored procedures must be invoked using the codice_7 statement.

 CALL procedure(...)
or
 EXECUTE procedure(...)

The exact and correct implementation of stored procedures varies from one database system to the other. Most major database vendors support them in some form. Depending on the database system, stored procedures can be implemented in a variety of programming languages, for example SQL, Java, C, or C++. Stored procedures written in non-SQL languages may or may not execute SQL statements themselves.

The increasing adoption of stored procedures led to the introduction of procedural elements to the SQL language in the and standards in the part SQL/PSM. That made SQL an imperative programming language. Most database systems offer proprietary and vendor-specific extensions, exceeding SQL/PSM. A standard specification for Java stored procedures exists as well as SQL/JRT.

==Comparison with static SQL==
;Overhead: Because stored procedure statements are stored directly in the database, they &quot;may&quot; remove all or part of the compiling overhead that is typically needed when software applications send inline (dynamic) SQL queries to a database. (However, most database systems implement &quot;statement caches&quot; and other methods to avoid repetitively compiling dynamic SQL statements.) Also, while they avoid some pre-compiled SQL, statements add to the complexity of creating an optimal execution plan because not all arguments of the SQL statement are supplied at compile time. Depending on the specific database implementation and configuration, mixed performance results will be seen from stored procedures versus generic queries or user defined functions.

;Avoiding network traffic: A major advantage of stored procedures is that they can run directly within the database engine. In a production system, this typically means that the procedures run entirely on a specialized database server with direct access to the data. The benefit is that it saves network costs, which stands out when a series of SQL statements are involved.

;Encapsulating business logic: Stored procedures allow programmers to embed business logic as an API in the database, which can simplify data management and reduce the need to encode the logic elsewhere in client programs. This can result in a lesser likelihood of data corruption by faulty client programs. The database system can ensure data integrity and consistency with the help of stored procedures.

;Delegating access-rights: In many systems, stored procedures can be granted access rights to the database that users who execute those procedures do not directly have.

;Some protection from SQL injection attacks: Stored procedures can be used to protect against injection attacks. Stored procedure parameters will be treated as data even if an attacker inserts SQL commands. Also, some DBMS will check the parameter&#x27;s type. However, a stored procedure that in turn generates dynamic SQL using the input is still vulnerable to SQL injections unless proper precautions are taken.

== Other uses ==
In some systems, stored procedures can be used to control transaction management; in others, stored procedures run inside a transaction such that transactions are effectively transparent to them. Stored procedures can also be invoked from a database trigger or a condition handler. For example, a stored procedure may be triggered by an insert on a specific table, or update of a specific field in a table, and the code inside the stored procedure would be executed. Writing stored procedures as condition handlers also allows database administrators to track errors in the system with greater detail by using stored procedures to catch the errors and record some audit information in the database or an external resource like a file.

== Comparison with functions ==
* A function is a subprogram written to perform certain computations.
* A scalar function returns only one value (or NULL), whereas a table function returns a (relational) table comprising zero or more rows, each row with one or more columns.
* Functions must return a value (using the codice_8 keyword), but for stored procedures this is not mandatory.
* Stored procedures can use codice_8 keyword but with no value being passed.
* Functions could be used in codice_1 statements, provided they do no data manipulation. However, procedures cannot be included in codice_1 statements.
* A stored procedure can return multiple values using the codice_12 parameter, or return no value.
* A stored procedure saves the query compiling time.
* A stored procedure is a database object.
* A stored procedure is a material object.

== Comparison with prepared statements ==
Prepared statements take an ordinary statement or query and parameterize it so that different literal values can be used at a later time. Like stored procedures, they are stored on the server for efficiency and provide some protection from SQL injection attacks. Although simpler and more declarative, prepared statements are not ordinarily written to use procedural logic and cannot operate on variables. Because of their simple interface and client-side implementations, prepared statements are more widely reusable between DBMS.

== Comparison with smart contracts ==
Smart contract is a term applied to executable code stored on a blockchain as opposed to an RDBMS. Despite the execution result consensus mechanisms of public blockchain networks differing in principle from traditional private or federated databases, they perform ostensibly the same function as stored procedures, albeit usually with a sense of value transaction.

== Disadvantages ==
* Stored procedure languages are often vendor-specific. Changing database vendors usually requires rewriting existing stored procedures.
* Changes to stored procedures are harder to keep track of within a version control system than other code. Changes must be reproduced as scripts to be stored in the project history to be included, and differences in procedures can be harder to merge and track correctly.
* Errors in stored procedures cannot be caught as part of a compilation or build step in an application IDE - the same is true if a stored procedure went missing or was accidentally deleted.
* Stored procedure languages from different vendors have different levels of sophistication.
*Tool support for writing and debugging stored procedures is often not as good as for other programming languages, but this differs between vendors and languages.
** For example, both PL/SQL and T-SQL have dedicated IDEs and debuggers. PL/PgSQL can be debugged from various IDEs.

<doc id="277252" wikidata="Q7807747" url="?curid=277252" title="Tin Foil Phoenix">
<text>Tin Foil Phoenix was a Canadian post-grunge band from Winnipeg. The band was formed by Michael Allen Zirk and Steven Kray, core members of a previous incarnation called Sonic Bloom. Guitarist Fish joined soon thereafter. Bassist Paul Robinson joined the band in 1999 and two years later, they added another guitarist, Phil Cholosky.

In 2001, they released &quot;Hurry&quot;, an independent seven-song EP. Its first single, &quot;Neopolitan&quot;, got a great amount of airplay on Canadian radio. The song soon caught the music industry&#x27;s attention and the band was signed to 604 Records/Universal in August 2002. The deal guaranteed the release of their debut album in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

In February 2002, the name of the band changed from Sonic Bloom to Tin Foil Phoenix because of legal concerns over the name expressed by their international label affiliate, Roadrunner Records.

Their first full-length album, &quot;Living In The Shadow Of The Bat&quot;, was released on September 14, 2004, by 604/Universal. They have a new single called &#x27;Have A Nice Day&#x27; on their MySpace and their second album &quot;Age Of Vipers&quot; is set for release on 20 May. The lead single of &quot;Age Of Vipers&quot; is called &quot;Hurry Home&quot;.

<doc id="277257" wikidata="Q2251200" url="?curid=277257" title="School prayer">
<text>School prayer, in the context of religious liberty, is state-sanctioned or mandatory prayer by students in public schools. Depending on the country and the type of school, state-sponsored prayer may be required, permitted, or prohibited. The United Kingdom requires daily worship by law, but does not enforce it. Countries which prohibit or limit school prayer often differ in their reasons for doing so. In the United States, school prayer cannot be required of students in accordance with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This is generally rigorously applied in public schools; the Establishment Clause does not prevent prayer in private schools that have no public funding. In Canada, school-sponsored prayer is disallowed under the concept of freedom of conscience as outlined in the Canadian Charter on Rights &amp; Fundamental Freedoms. School-sponsored prayer is disallowed in France as a byproduct of its status as a secular nation.

== Countries that permit school-sponsored prayer ==

=== Indonesia ===

School prayers are a longstanding tradition in Indonesian schools. There is no specific law mandating school prayers in Indonesia. Before a religious education lesson, students pray according to their respective religions. On 10 December 2014, Minister of Education and Culture Anies Baswedan proposed to regulate the contents of school prayers before and after school. He denied rumours that he wanted to ban school prayers.

=== United Kingdom ===
In England and Wales, the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 states that all pupils in state schools must take part in a daily act of collective worship, unless their parents request that they be excused from attending. This collective worship must be &quot;wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character&quot;. A legislative document provided by His Majesty&#x27;s Government and drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel provides that if a parent of a child within the school decides not to receive further religious education, they will be exempt from it hencewith. Ofsted&#x27;s 2002-03 annual report, however, stated that 80% of secondary schools were not providing daily worship for all pupils.

==== School Standards and Framework Act 1998; c. 31; Part II; Chapter VI; Religious Worship; Section 70 ====

===== 70 Requirements relating to collective worship =====
(1) Subject to section 71, each pupil in attendance at a community, foundation or voluntary school shall on each school day take part in an act of

collective worship.

(2) Subject to section 71, in relation to any community, foundation or voluntary school—

(a) the [F1local authority] and the governing body shall exercise their functions with a view to securing, and

(b) the head teacher shall secure,

that subsection (1) is complied with.

(3) Schedule 20 makes further provision with respect to the collective worship required by this section,

including provision relating to—

(a) the arrangements which are to be made in connection with such worship, and

(b) the nature of such worship.

The Department of Education in England states that all schools must maintain religious prayer in schools in order to reflect the beliefs and traditions of the country, which were conventionally of the Christian faith (as of mid-2010&#x27;s there has been a demographic increase in the number of schools of Islamic or Muslim nature). However, a recent BBC radio study shows that 64% of children (out of 500) do not attend or participate in daily acts of worship or prayer. Regarding public opinion in the United Kingdom for mandated school prayer, the numbers are relatively similar. In fact, a 2011 survey conducted by BBC found that 60% of parents (out of the 1,743 questioned) believed that the legislation that requires group worship should not be enforced at all. Although parents do retain the right to officially keep their children from taking part in daily worship, there are critics who claim the legislation should be changed or discarded completely in order to allow for religious freedom and cater to the wants of parents, children, and staff.

=== United States ===
=== Canada ===

==== British Columbia ====
Prior to 1944, in British Columbia, the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; (1872) permitted the use of the Lord’s Prayer in opening or closing school. In 1944, the government of British Columbia amended the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; to provide for compulsory Bible reading at the opening of the school day, to be followed by a compulsory recitation of the Lord’s Prayer. This amendment appeared as section 167 of the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot;, and read as follows:

167. All public schools shall be opened by the reading, without explanation or comment, of a passage of Scripture to be selected from readings prescribed or approved by the Council of Public Instruction. The reading of the passage of Scripture shall be followed by the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, but otherwise the schools shall be conducted on strictly secular and non-sectarian principles. The highest morality shall be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed shall be taught. 1948, c.42, s.167

The compulsory nature of the Bible reading and prayer recitation was slightly modified by regulations drawn up by the Council of Public Instruction. These regulations provided that either a teacher or student who has conscientious ground for objecting to the religious observances may be excused from them. The procedure to be followed in such cases was outlined in the regulations, which follow in full:Division (15)—Scripture Readings (Section 167)
15.01 Where a teacher sends a written notice to the Board of School Trustees or official trustee by whom he is employed that he has conscientious objections to conducting the. ceremony of reading prescribed selections from the Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer (as provided by Section 167 of the Public Schools Act), he shall be excused from such duty, and in such case it shall be the duty of the Board of School Trustees or official trustee concerned to arrange with the Principal to have the ceremony conducted by some other teacher in the school, or by a school trustee, or, where neither of these alternatives is possible, by one of the senior pupils of the school or by some other suitable person other than an ordained member of a religious sect or denomination.

15.02 Where the parent or guardian of any pupil attending a public school sends a written notice to the teacher of the pupil stating that for conscientious reasons he does not wish the pupil to attend the ceremony of reading prescribed selections from the Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer at the opening of school, the teacher shall excuse the pupil from attendance at such ceremony and at his discretion may assign the pupil some other useful employment at school during that period, but the pupil so excused shall not be deprived of any other benefits of the school by reason of his non-attendance at the ceremony.

In 1982, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms received royal assent. Section 2 of the charter guaranteeing freedom of conscience and freedom of religion trumped Section 167 of the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; (1872). Sixteen years later in 1996, based on precedent that would be established in Ontario (1989), required recitation of the Lord’s Prayer as outlined in the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; would be held to violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

==== Ontario ====
The challenges to Christian opening and closing exercises occurred mainly in Ontario with the crucial case being fought in The Ontario Court of Appeal in 1988.

Zylberberg v. Sudbury Board of Education (Director) The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the use of the Lord’s Prayer in opening exercises in public schools offended the Charter s. 2(a). 1988. (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 641, 29 O.A.C. 23 (C.A.). Education regulations did not require the use of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and there was an exemption provision. The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the regulation infringed religious freedom because schools could use only the Lord&#x27;s Prayer rather than a more inclusive approach. It was argued that the exemption provision effectively stigmatized children and coerced them into a religious observance which was offensive to them.

The Ontario Court of Appeal was persuaded by the argument that the need to seek exemption from Christian exercises is itself a form of religious discrimination. The judges described as insensitive the position of the respondents that it was beneficial for the minority children to confront the fact of their difference from the majority.

==== &quot;Russow v. British Columbia&quot; ====
In 1989, Joan Russow challenged, in the British Columbia Supreme Court, the Public Schools Act″s requirement that in British Columbia all public schools were to be opened with the Lord’s Prayer and a Bible reading. The argument was similar to the &quot;Zylberberg&quot; case and the result was the same: The offending words in the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; were removed as being inconsistent with freedom of conscience and religion guarantees in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Further following the &quot;Zylberberg&quot; case to strike down use of the Lord’s Prayer in schools, the British Columbia Supreme Court incorporated the Ontario Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision in &quot;Zylberberg&quot; in its entirety.

From 1871 to 1989, observance of school prayer had declined.

With the unfavorable court decision, the requirement for Christian morning exercises was replaced with the following clauses found in the &quot;School Act&quot; (1996) in British Columbia.
Conduct:
76 (1) All schools and Provincial schools must be conducted on strictly secular and nonsectarian principles.
(2) The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed is to be – taught in a school or Provincial school.

=== France ===
As a secular state (laïcité), France has no school prayers in secular state-run institutions. Instead, public servants are advised to keep their religious faith private, and may be censured if they display it too openly. The French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools goes beyond restricting prayer in schools and bans the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols by pupils in public primary and secondary schools. However, teachers in private religious schools have been paid by the government.

=== India ===

Being a secular state, religious instructions are prohibited by Article 26 of the Indian Constitution in schools administered by the state and hence school sponsored prayers are not allowed. However, Indian law also allows Islamic and other minority religious private schools to receive partial financial support from the states&#x27; and the central government of India to offer religious indoctrination if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race, or other protected status grounds.

== Ongoing debate ==

=== Arguments for and against school prayer ===
The issue of school prayer remains contentious even where courts as diverse as those in Canada, the United States, Russia, and Poland attempt to strike a balance between religious and secular activity in state-sponsored arenas. Some arguments have held that religion in schools is both an effective sociomoral tool as well as a valuable means to psychological stability. On the opposing side, others have argued that prayer has no place in a classroom where impressionable students are continually subject to influence by the majority. The latter view holds that, to the extent that a public school itself promotes the majority religion, the state is guilty of coercive interference in the lives of the individual.

<doc id="277259" wikidata="Q496380" url="?curid=277259" title="Icicle">
<text>An icicle is a spike of ice formed when water falling from an object freezes.
== Formation and dynamics ==
Icicles can form during bright, sunny, but subfreezing weather, when ice or snow melted by sunlight or some other heat source (such as a poorly insulated building), refreezes as it drips off under exposed conditions. Over time continued water runoff will cause the icicle to grow. Another set of conditions is during ice storms, when rain falling in air slightly below freezing slowly accumulates as numerous small icicles hanging from twigs, leaves, wires, etc. Thirdly, icicles can form wherever water seeps out of or drips off vertical surfaces such as road cuts or cliffs. Under some conditions these can slowly form the &quot;frozen waterfalls&quot; favored by ice climbers.

Icicles form on surfaces which might have a smooth and straight, or irregular shape, which in turn influences the shape of an icicle. Another influence is melting water, which might flow toward the icicle in a straight line or which might flow from several directions. Impurities in the water can lead to ripples on the surface of the icicles.

Icicles elongate by the growth of ice as a tube into the pendant drop. The wall of this ice tube is about and the width . As a result of this growth process, the interior of a growing icicle is liquid water. The growth of an icicle both in length and in width can be calculated and is a complicated function of air temperature, wind speed, and the water flux into the icicle. The growth rate in length typically varies with time, and can in ideal conditions be more than per minute.

Given the right conditions, icicles may also form in caves (in which case they are also known as &quot;ice stalactites&quot;). They can also form within salty water (brine) sinking from sea ice. These so-called &quot;brinicles&quot; can kill sea urchins and starfish, which was observed by BBC film crews near Mount Erebus, Antarctica.

== Dangers ==

Icicles can pose personal and structural dangers. Icicles that hang from an object may fall and cause injury and/or damage to whoever or whatever is below them. In addition, ice deposits can be heavy. If enough icicles form on an object, such as a wire, beam, or pole, the weight of the ice can severely damage the structural integrity of the object and may cause the object to break. This can also happen with roofs, where failure can damage nearby parked vehicles or the contents and occupants of the structure. Icicles on roofs can also be associated with ice dams, which can cause water damage as the water penetrates below the shingles.

The story of an English youth killed by a falling icicle in 1776 has often been recounted.

Large icicles that form on cliffs near highways have been known to fall and damage motor vehicles.

In 2010, five people were killed and 150 injured by icicles in Saint Petersburg, Russia after heavy snow that also caused apartment block roofs to collapse, as well as creating water damage to private homes and to the National Library of Russia.

<text>Gotha (German: &quot;Landkreis Gotha&quot;) is a Kreis (district) in western central Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis, Sömmerda, the Kreis-free city Erfurt, Ilm-Kreis, Schmalkalden-Meiningen and the Wartburgkreis.

==Geography==
Gotha borders the Thuringian Basin in the north and east, with a low point of about 200 meters (656 feet) in the northern part of the district. Fahner Heights, a muschelkalk ridge with a height of 413 meters (1,355 feet), is located in the extreme north, between the municipalities of Tonna and Bienstädt.

The land rises to about 900 meters (2,953 feet) in the Thuringian Forest, which covers the south-western area of the district. The Rennsteig hiking trail follows a ridge line through the forest. The highest point in the district is Großer Inselsberg at 916.5 m (3,007 ft), on the border with Schmalkalden-Meiningen. The southern area of the district also has 3 dams: the Ohra Dam near the village of Luisenthal, as well as the Tambach-Dietharz Dam and the Schmalwasser Dam, both in the catchment area of the Apfelstädt, near the town of Tambach-Dietharz.

On the southeastern boundary of the district, between Ohrdruf and Mühlberg, is the muschelkalk Ohrdrufer Plateau which sits at an average of about 450 meters (1,436 ft). Since 1906, 49.5 km2 of this plateau has been used as military proving ground.

Aside from the areas covered by the Thuringian forest and other small wooded ridges, the district is largely used for agriculture.

==History==

===Administrative===

In 1640, Gotha was partitioned from the Saxon Duchy of Saxe-Weimar to form the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha in the Holy Roman Empire. After acquiring additional territory from nearby dutchies, Saxe-Gotha was itself partitioned into seven dutchies in 1680, with the Gotha territory continuing in Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. The duchy&#x27;s ruling family line went extinct in 1825 with the death of Frederick IV, and the territory was divided again, this time into Saxe-Hildburghausen and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. With the abolishment of the Monarchy of Germany following the November Revolution, the territory of Coburg was merged into Bavaria, and Gotha became part of Thuringia.

The Weimar district of Gotha was formed on October 1, 1922, from the largest parts of the cities and surrounding district offices of Gotha, Ohrdruf, and Waltershausen. The city of Gotha was made the district capital. This merged district extended south to Oberhof.

During the Nazi regime, municipal self-government ended abruptly in 1933. After the Second World War, both the US and later Soviet military government reinstated the administrative structures from the Weimar period, with some municipal additions and removals happening in 1946. In 1949, Gotha was integrated into East Germany, undergoing further territorial changes in 1950 and during the administrative reform of 1952.

In May 1990, the first free municipal elections since 1946 took place in Thuringia, with Thuringia being re-established as a free state later in October of that year. Local government was officially granted power by Thuringia in 1993, in the form of district councils and district administrators. The most recent territorial change for the district was in 1994, where it gained several towns from surrounding former East German districts.

In 2009, the Nesse-Apfelstädt-Gemeinden Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) was disbanded.

=== Population ===
:

===Directors, Chairmen, and Administrators of the District===

==Partnerships==
Since 1990 the district has a partnership with the district Main-Kinzig in Hessen, Germany.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows Friedenstein Castle in the top, the largest Baroque building located in the city of Gotha. The wavy line below symbolizes the Leina canal, which was built 1366 to 1369 from Schönau to Gotha, to bring water into the city. The star at the bottom was the symbol of the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

The coat of arms was granted 28 June 1991.

<text>Originally, an alcoholate was the crystalline form of a salt in which alcohol took the place of water of crystallization, such as [SnCl3(OC2H5)·C2H5OH]2 and C8H6N4O5·CH3OH. However this denomination should not be used anymore for the ending -ate often occurs in names for anions.

The second meaning of the word is that of a tincture, or alcoholic extract of plant material.

The third, and more usual meaning of the word is as a synonym for alkoxide— is the conjugate base of an alcohol.

<text>A rusticle is a formation of rust similar to an icicle or stalactite in appearance that occurs deep underwater when iron-loving bacteria attack and oxidize wrought iron and steel. They may be familiar from underwater photographs of shipwrecks, such as the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; and the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;. They have also been found in the #3 turret, an 8-inch gun turret on the stern remains in place of the USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot;. 
The word &quot;rusticle&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;rust&quot; and &quot;icicle&quot; and was coined by Robert Ballard, who first observed them on the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1986. Rusticles on the &quot;Titanic&quot; were first investigated in 1996 by Roy Cullimore, based at the University of Regina in Canada. A previously unknown species of bacteria living inside the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s rusticles called &quot;Halomonas titanicae&quot; was discovered in 2010 by Henrietta Mann.

Rusticles can form on any submerged steel object and have been seen on other subsea structures such as mooring chains and subsea equipment. They form more rapidly in warmer climates and can form in water with little to no dissolved oxygen.

==Composition==
The rusticle consists of up to 35% iron compounds including iron oxides, iron carbonates, and iron hydroxides. Rusticles are found in a tube shapes of iron oxides which are vertical to one another. Rusticles are found to grow at approximately a year and are most often found in areas of sunken hulls underwater.

The remainder of the structure is a complex community of symbiotic or mutualistic microbes including bacteria &quot;Halomonas titanicae&quot; and fungi that use the rusting metal as a source of food, causing microbial corrosion and collectively producing the mineral compounds that form the rusticle as waste products.

Rusticles have been found to most often be composed of iron, calcium, chloride, magnesium, silica, sodium, and sulfate while there are other chemical compositions of rusticles but in much smaller quantities.

==Structure==
Structurally, rusticles contain channels which allow water to flow through, and they seem to build up in a ring structure similar to the growth rings of a tree. They are very delicate and can easily disintegrate into fine powder on even the slightest touch.

==Colours==
The outer surface of a rusticle is smooth red in appearance from the iron(III) oxide, while the core is bright orange due to the presence of crystals of goethite. There are several morphologies of the rusticle, some of which are conical, cylindrical, and rusticle on the seafloor.

<text>An iron oxide is a chemical compound composed of iron and oxygen. Several iron oxides are recognized. Often they are non-stoichiometric. Ferric oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust.

Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides are widespread in nature and play an important role in many geological and biological processes. They are used as iron ores, pigments, catalysts, and in thermite, and occur in hemoglobin. Iron oxides are inexpensive and durable pigments in paints, coatings and colored concretes. Colors commonly available are in the &quot;earthy&quot; end of the yellow/orange/red/brown/black range. When used as a food coloring, it has E number E172.

==Stoichiometries== 

Iron oxides feature as ferrous (Fe(II)) or ferric (Fe(III)) or both. They adopt octahedral or tetrahedral coordination geometry. Only a few oxides are significant at the earth&#x27;s surface, particularly wüstite, magnetite, and hematite.

* Oxides of FeII
** FeO: iron(II) oxide, wüstite 
* Mixed oxides of FeII and FeIII
** Fe3O4: Iron(II,III) oxide, magnetite 
** Fe4O5
** Fe5O6
** Fe5O7
** Fe25O32
**Fe13O19
* Oxides of FeIII
** Fe2O3: iron(III) oxide 
*** α-Fe2O3: alpha phase, hematite 
*** β-Fe2O3: beta phase
*** γ-Fe2O3: gamma phase, maghemite 
*** ε-Fe2O3: epsilon phase

==Thermal expansion==
==Oxide-hydroxides==

* goethite (α-FeOOH)
* akaganéite (β-FeOOH)
* lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH)
* feroxyhyte (δ-FeOOH)
* ferrihydrite (Fe5HO8 · 4 H2O approx., or 5 Fe2O3 · 9 H2O, better recast as FeOOH · 0.4 H2O)
* high-pressure pyrite-structured FeOOH. Once dehydration is triggered, this phase may form FeO2H&quot;x&quot; (0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1).
* green rust (FeFeOH3&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; − &quot;z&quot; (A−)&quot;z&quot; where A− is Cl− or 0.5 )

==Reactions==
In blast furnaces and related factories, iron oxides are converted to the metal. Typical reducing agents are various forms of carbon. A representative reaction starts with ferric oxide: 

===In nature ===
Iron is stored in many organisms in the form of ferritin, which is a ferrous oxide encased in a solubilizing protein sheath.

Species of bacteria, including &quot;Shewanella oneidensis&quot;, &quot;Geobacter sulfurreducens&quot; and &quot;Geobacter metallireducens&quot;, use iron oxides as terminal electron acceptors.

==Uses==
Almost all iron ores are oxides, so in that sense these materials are important precursors to iron metal and its many alloys.

Iron oxides are important pigments, coming in a variety of colors (black, red, yellow). Among their many advantages, they are inexpensive, strongly colored, and nontoxic.

Magnetite is a component of magnetic recording tapes.

<doc id="277267" wikidata="Q1377706" url="?curid=277267" title="Grey Owl">
<text>Archibald Stansfeld Belaney (September 18, 1888April 13, 1938), commonly known as Grey Owl, was an English–Canadian popular writer, public speaker and conservationist. Born an Englishman, in the latter years of his life he passed as half-Indian, claiming he was the son of a Scottish man and an Apache woman. With books, articles and public appearances promoting wilderness conservation, he achieved fame in the 1930s. Shortly after his death in 1938, his real identity as the Englishman Archie Belaney was exposed. He has been called one of the first pretendians.

Moving to Canada as a young man, Belaney established himself as a woodsman and trapper, before rising to prominence as an author and lecturer. While working for the Dominion Parks Branch of Canada in the 1930s, Belaney was named the &quot;caretaker of park animals&quot;, first at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba and then at Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan. His views on wilderness conservation, expressed in numerous articles, books, lectures and films, reached audiences beyond the borders of Canada, bringing attention to the negative impact of exploiting nature and the urgent need to develop respect for the natural world. He was particularly concerned about the plight of the beaver (Canada&#x27;s national animal), which by the 1920s had been hunted almost to extinction.

Recognition of Belaney includes biographies, academic studies, historic plaques in England, Ontario and Quebec, and a film based on his life, directed by Richard Attenborough.

== Early life (18881906)==

Archibald Stansfeld Belaney was born on September 18, 1888, in Hastings, England, into an upper-middle-class English family. His father was George Belaney and his mother Katherine &quot;Kittie&quot; Cox. His paternal grandfather had come from Scotland and married in England.

Kittie was George Belaney&#x27;s second wife. Before Archie&#x27;s birth, George had immigrated to the United States with his then-wife Elizabeth Cox and her younger sister, Kittie. After Elizabeth&#x27;s early death, George married 15-year-old Kittie. Within the year they returned to England in time for the birth of their son Archie. George was unable to settle down to steady employment and wasted much of the family&#x27;s fortune on various unsuccessful business ventures. He agreed to return permanently to the United States in exchange for a small allowance. Archie remained in England in the care of his father&#x27;s mother, Juliana Belaney, and his father&#x27;s two younger sisters, Janet Adelaide Belaney and Julia Caroline Belaney, whom the boy would know as Aunt Ada and Aunt Carry. It was Aunt Ada who would come to dominate Archie&#x27;s early life.

Belaney attended Hastings Grammar School, where he excelled in subjects such as English, French and chemistry. &quot;He mixed little with the other students in class, or afterwards. The shy, withdrawn boy, ashamed of having been abandoned by his parents, lived largely in his own world.&quot; Outside school, he spent time reading and exploring St Helen&#x27;s Wood near his home. He also collected snakes and other small animals. Belaney was known for pranks, such as using his chemistry set to make small bombs, which he called &quot;Belaney Bombs&quot;.

Fascinated by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, Belaney read about them and drew pictures of them in the margins of his books. He prepared maps showing the linguistic divisions in Canada and the locations of the tribes. His knowledge impressed his aunt Ada, who was &quot;amazed at his knowledge of the detail... He was not interested in the romantic picture of the Indians but in their mastery over nature...&quot;

Belaney left Hastings Grammar School and started working as a clerk in a lumber yard, where, on weekends, he and his friend George McCormick perfected knife throwing and marksmanship. He hated the job and ensured a sudden end to it by lowering a bag of fireworks down the chimney of the company&#x27;s office. The resulting explosion almost destroyed the building. Although, in agreement with his aunt Ada, he was supposed to work longer in England, he was finally allowed to move to Canada, with the understanding he would &quot;learn to be a farmer while he was getting used to the country&quot;.

On March 29, 1906, at the age of 18, Belaney boarded SS &quot;Canada&quot; for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Arriving on April 6, he went to Toronto, where, with no intention of becoming a farmer, he worked for some time in a retail shop (perhaps Eaton&#x27;s).

== First years in Canada (19061915) ==

Toronto held no appeal for Belaney, and he soon left, bound for Lake Temagami, one of the largest lakes in northern Ontario, and home of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai (deep water people) community. In 1907 he was working at the Temagami Inn as a &quot;chore-boy&quot;. He returned home to Hastings for a short visit during the winter of 19071908, probably to ask for money from his aunts. He learned then that his father had been killed in a drunken brawl in the United States.

Belaney returned to work at the Temagami Inn in 1908. He determined to lose the remaining traces of his English accent and began to develop his story of an Indian boyhood in Mexico and the American Southwest. At the Temagami Inn he met Angele Egwuna, who was working there as a kitchen-helper. She spoke little English and he little Ojibwe, but a friendship developed. Through Angele he also met members of her family, who called him &quot;gitchi-saganash&quot; (tall Englishman). Her uncle gave him the nickname &quot;ko-hom-see&quot; (little owl), a name that would be transformed years later into &quot;Grey Owl&quot;.

The Egwunas invited Belaney to spend the winter of 19091910 trapping with them in the bush to the east of the south arm of Lake Temagami, where he learned how the Temagami Ojibwe managed their hunting territories by killing only the animals that they needed and leaving the rest to reproduce. The time with the Egwunas improved both his proficiency with the Ojibwe language and the skills he needed to survive and make a living in the bush. Belaney would later report this as his &quot;formal adoption&quot; by the Ojibwe. The boy from Hastings was finally living the life he had dreamed of.

In the summers of 1910 and 1911, Belaney worked as a guide at Camp Keewaydin, an American boys’ camp on Lake Temagami. On August 23, 1910, he and Angele Egwuna were married on Bear Island in a Christian ceremony. In spring 1911 their daughter Agnes was born.

Little is known of Belaney&#x27;s life in the winter of 19111912. He next surfaces, alone, in the summer of 1912 in Biscotasing. He worked in the surrounding area as a forest ranger during the summers of 19121914 and spent the winters in the bush on the trapline. In Bisco, Belaney began a relationship with Marie Girard, a Metis woman who worked as a maid in the boarding-house where he stayed. At his invitation she joined him on his trapline during the winter of 19131914.

There is no record of Belaney&#x27;s life in the winter of 19141915. In June, 1915, he sailed for England with the Canadian Army. Marie Girard died of tuberculosis in the fall of 1915, shortly after giving birth to their son, John Jero.

In his first years in Canada, Belaney had established himself as a backcountry woodsman, with a keen appreciation of the wilderness. His debut as husband and father had been less successful: &quot;Archie kept falling deeper and deeper into personal problems of his own making, going from one crisis to another.&quot;

== In the Canadian Army (19151917) ==

Belaney enlisted with the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force on May 6, 1915, during the First World War. In June he was shipped to England and initially assigned to the 23rd Reserve Battalion in Kent. He later joined the 13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), known as the Black Watch, and was shipped to the front line in France, where he served as a sniper. Fellow soldiers accepted his assumed Indian identity, with one writing that he &quot;...saw him squirm up muddy hills in a way no white man could. He had all the actions and features of an Indian... Never in all my life did I ever meet a man who was better able to hide when we would go out onto No Man&#x27;s Land.&quot;

Belaney was wounded in the right wrist on January 15, 1916. Then on April 23 he was shot in the right foot, a serious injury from which he never fully recovered. He was shipped back to England, where it was found necessary to amputate a toe. From November 1916 to March 1917, he convalesced in the Canadian Military Hospital in his home town of Hastings.

Encouraged by his aunts, Belaney renewed his childhood friendship with Ivy Holmes. Ivy, then 26, was an accomplished professional dancer, who had travelled extensively in Europe. Acquainted with her since childhood, he dispensed with the pretense of being Indian. She found that his stories about canoeing in Canada made the &quot;backwoods sound terribly attractive&quot;. Belaney was silent about his wife and child back in Canada. They were married on February 10, 1917.

The couple decided that Belaney would return to Canada and establish himself near Biscotasing, then send for Ivy, who &quot;looked forward to seeing his beloved wilderness&quot;. Exactly how he thought that plan would work out, with a legal wife and child no more than 100 kilometers away and (as far as he knew) a mistress in the same town, is a mystery. Belaney left for Canada on September 19, 1917. Ivy never saw him again. He wrote to her for a year until he finally admitted that he was already married. Ivy divorced him in 1922.

== Back to Canada (19171925) ==

Belaney returned to Canada in September 1917, and was discharged from the army at the end of November. His most pressing concern was his wounded foot, which was painful and limited his mobilityan unfortunate prospect for someone who wanted to go back into the bush. In October he received treatment at a hospital in Toronto, but achieved little success. He had other worries: What to do about his first wife, Angele, and his daughter Agnes? What to do about his second wife, Ivy, still in England and expecting to be sent for? What to do about his illegitimate son, Johnny, born to his deceased mistress Marie? After meeting with Angele, he returned to Biscotasing at the end of 1917, alone.

Belaney soon gained a reputation for drunkenness and disorderly conduct in Bisco. Despite this, he made a favorable impression on many people, one person recalling &quot;[I] liked immensely this endearing rebel. Archie was one of the nicest things that happened to me when I was growing up.&quot;

Belaney spent much of 1918 recuperating and gradually regained control of his right foot, but the disability remained for the rest of his life, with his foot sometimes swelling to twice its normal size. He did not approach Johnny and the boy did not learn who his father was till years later. He finally admitted to Ivy that he was already married, which ended their relationship. (He would be served divorce papers in 1921.) Now he had a new worry: His aunts were furious with him and regarded his treatment of Angele and Ivy as &quot;nothing less than diabolical&quot;.

In the summer of 1919, Belaney worked on a survey party in the bush. A co-worker recalled &quot;The &#x27;Mexican half-breed&#x27; had an unattractive side. &#x27;He was taciturn and morose, with a violent, almost maniacal temper.

His best friends in Bisco were the Espaniels, an Indigenous family with whom he lived in the early 1920s. He joined them for two winters trapping at Indian Lake on the east branch of the Spanish River. Belaney also maintained a cabin on his hunting ground nearby at Mozhabong Lake. His command of the Ojibwe language benefited from this time with the Espaniels, and he also learned the &quot;Indian way of doing things&quot;which in Jim Espaniel&#x27;s words &quot;the white man calls conservation&quot;.

In the summers of 1920 and 1921, he worked as the deputy forest ranger on the Mississagi Forest Reserve.

Worried about the logging of Ontario&#x27;s remaining old-growth pine forests, Belaney wanted the Mississagi area made into a park. In a fledgling attempt at conservationism, he posted signs saying &quot;GOD MADE THIS COUNTRY FOR THE TREES DON’T BURN IT UP AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HELL&quot; and &quot;GOD MADE THE COUNTRY BUT MAN DESTROYED IT&quot;.

Inspired by his boyhood reading of authors such as Fenimore Cooper and Longfellow, Belaney invented his own elaborately choreographed &quot;war dance&quot;, which &quot;...surprised the local Ojibwa and Cree for, as fur buyer Jack Leve put it, &#x27;The Bisco Indians didn&#x27;t know his brand of Indian lore. Local reactions to the war dance were mixed, with some people saying it was good fun, while others said it was just an excuse for drinking. Some Indigenous men joined in, while others thought the dance was evil.

Belaney&#x27;s big day arrived on Victoria Day, May 23, 1923. The Sudbury &quot;Star&quot; reported: &quot;War Dance Given at Biscotasing. A Big Celebration Held on Victoria Day. In honour of the good queen to which his grandfather and namesake had sent his epic poem, &quot;The Hundred Days of Napoleon&quot;, Archie put on the greatest war dance of his life.&quot;

In April, 1925, an arrest warrant was issued for Belaney after a particularly egregious piece of misbehaviour. Soon after, he left Bisco for good, returning to Temagami and taking up again with Angele, who bore him a second daughter, Flora, in 1926. Amazingly, there is no record of Angele ever reproaching him for his treatment of her, and she appeared to accept his wayward conduct to the end. In the fall of 1925, she saw him off at the train stationand never saw him again. By then, Belaney had already begun his fourth relationship.

== Transformation into Grey Owl (19251931) ==
The transformation of Archie Belaney from a backcountry woodsman into the popular writer and public speaker Grey Owl began in 1925. His concern, expressed in books, articles and public appearances, was the vanishing wilderness and the consequences of this for the creatures living in it, including man. His message was &quot;Remember you belong to nature, not it to you.&quot;

In the late summer of 1925, 36-year-old Belaney began courting 19-year-old Gertrude Bernard. Their relationship would last till 1936, and prove to be both tumultuous and a crucial factor in Belaney&#x27;s transformation. They met at Camp Wabikon, located on Temagami Island, where he was working as a guide. She was of Algonquin and Mohawk descent.

Her father&#x27;s nickname for her was &quot;Pony&quot;, but she would come to be known by another name, &quot;Anahareo&quot;. According to her account in &quot;Devil in Deerskins: My Life with Grey Owl&quot;, Belaney&#x27;s answer to her father&#x27;s question about his background was this: &quot;I come from Mexico. [M]y father was Scotch and my mother was an Apache Indian.&quot; Anahareo did not discover Belaney&#x27;s true identity until his death and exposure in 1938.

In February, 1926, Anahareo joined Belaney near Doucet in the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, where he was earning a living as a trapper. Their courtship was eventful at times. Anahareo later claimed she once stabbed Belaney with a knife. In summer Belaney proposed to her. Due to his undissolved marriage to his first wife, Angele Egwuna, the couple could not marry under Canadian law, but the chief of the Lac Simon Band of Indians declared them husband and wife.

After a summer working as a fire ranger in Quebec, Belaney was back trapping again in the winter of 19261927. Anahareo accompanied him on the trapline and was horrified by what she experienced:


She attempted to make him see the torture that animals suffered when they were caught in traps. According to the account given in &quot;Pilgrims of the Wild&quot;, Belaney located a beaver lodge, which he knew to be occupied by a mother beaver, and set a trap for her. When the mother beaver was caught, he began to canoe away to the cries of the kittens, which greatly resemble the sound of human infants. Anahareo begged him to set the mother free, but, needing the money from the beaver&#x27;s pelt, he could not be swayed. The next day he rescued the baby beavers, which the couple adopted. As Albert Braz stated in his article &quot;St. Archie of the Wild&quot;, &quot;[P]rimarily because of this episode, Belaney comes to believe that it is &#x27;monstrous&#x27; to hunt such creatures and determines to &#x27;study them&#x27; rather than &#x27;persecuting them further&#x27;.&quot;

In 1928, lured by stories of abundant wildlife and bush, Belaney and Anahareo, along with the adopted beavers, McGinnis and McGinty, moved to southeastern Quebec, where they were to reside until 1931. Their intention was to set up a beaver colony, where the beavers would be protected and could be studied. Arriving in Cabano in autumn to find the vicinity heavily logged and unsuitable, they moved to the area of Lake Touladi, east of Lake Témiscouata, and built a cabin on Birch Lake, where they spent Christmas and the rest of winter. They found a family of beaver in the vicinity. 
Belaney&#x27;s first article, &quot;The Passing of the Last Frontier&quot;, was published on March 2, 1929 in the English magazine &quot;Country Life&quot;. The article was submitted by his mother, Katherine Scott-Brown, and the magazine mistakenly attributed the authorship to her. In a later issue they ran a correction identifying the author as her son, Archibald Stansfeld Belaney. In March 1929, Belaney received a check for the article and a request from the publisher for the book that would be published in 1931 as &quot;The Men of the Last Frontier&quot;.

An unfortunate incident occurred that put an end to their dream of founding a beaver colony on Birch Lake: A friend of theirs, David White Stone, had arrived at their cabin while they were away and, unaware of their plans, had trapped the beavers that were to be the start of the colony. Then yet another unfortunate incident occurred: The two beavers, McGinnis and McGinty, disappeared. The couple was devastated by the incidents. David White Stone and Anahareo found two beaver kittens to replace the &quot;two Micks&quot;. One of them soon died. They adopted the surviving beaver, naming it Jelly Roll, and moved to a cabin on Hay Lake near Cabano. At the end of summer the three relocated for some time to the nearby resort town of Metis, where Belaney gave his first public lecture. He moved back to Hay Lake with Jelly Roll, while Anahareo and David White Stone left to work his mining claim in northern Quebec.

In 1930, Belaney published his first article for the periodical &quot;Canadian Forest and Outdoors&quot;, &quot;The Vanishing Life of the Wild&quot;. Under the name &quot;Grey Owl&quot; he wrote many articles for the periodical in the following years, becoming increasingly known in Canada and the United States. In June he inadvertently caught a beaver in a trap, which he nursed back to health and named Rawhide. His writing brought him into contact with Gordon Dallyn, the editor of &quot;Canadian Forest and Outdoors&quot;, who introduced him to James Harkin, the Commissioner of National Parks. In the spring, he received a visit from the Parks Branch publicity director, J.C. Campbell. The Parks Branch commissioned the first beaver film, &quot;The Beaver People&quot;, which featured the two beavers, as well as Anahareo and Belaney (identified as Grey Owl), and was shot in the summer of 1930. In correspondence with his London publisher Country Life, Belaney signed himself &quot;Grey Owl&quot; for the first time in November. 

In January, 1931, Belaney, in the persona of Grey Owl, gave a talk at the annual convention of the Canadian Forestry Association in Montreal, where the film was shown in public for the first time. &quot;The event was a huge success. It set the pattern for numerous speeches Grey Owl was to give, dressed in his Indian regalia, with films of his tame beaver to illustrate his stories.&quot;

The Parks Branch offered Grey Owl a position as &quot;caretaker of park animals&quot; at the Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba. Years later James Harkin explained his reasons for the offer: &quot;The providing of a position for Grey Owl was entirely to serve our purpose of securing publicity for the National Parks and for wild life conservation by using Grey Owl&#x27;s beaver and Grey Owl&#x27;s personality as a spear-head in that connection.&quot;

== Beaver Lodge (19311935) ==

In the spring of 1931, Grey Owl and Anahareo, with the beavers, left Quebec, bound for a new life in the west, where a cabin had been built for them on Beaver Lodge Lake.

In June, a second beaver film was produced. This film, &quot;The Beaver Family&quot;, was shot by the cameraman W. J. Oliver, and released in 1932. Grey Owl would work with W.J. Oliver on more films in the coming years.

Beaver Lodge Lake proved to be unsuitable for the beavers, as a summer drought had resulted in the water becoming stagnant and the risk of the lake freezing to the bottom in winter could not be ignored. The bigger waterways of Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan were found to be a better habitat for beaver..

In October the group relocated to Lake Ajawaan in the park, which was ideal for their needs, being isolated, heavily wooded and teeming with wildlife. The Superintendent of the Park, Major J.A. Wood, had a cabin built for them according to Grey Owl&#x27;s specifications. It was known thereafter as Beaver Lodge, and would be Grey Owl&#x27;s base until his death in 1938. He received many prominent visitors at the lodge, including the Governor-General, John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, an admirer of Grey Owl&#x27;s writings on wildlife, the poet Charles G. D. Roberts and his son, the writer William Harris Lloyd Roberts.

In late 1931, Grey Owl&#x27;s first book, on which he had been working for two years, was published under the title &quot;The Men of the Last Frontier&quot;. Grey Owl intended the title to be &quot;The Vanishing Frontier&quot;, but to his chagrin, the publisher, Country Life, changed the title to &quot;The Men of the Last Frontier&quot; without consulting him.

Among other topics the book describes the plight of the beaver in the face of extensive trapping and raises concerns about the future of the Canadian wilderness and wildlife. The demand for beaver pelts in the 1920s and 30s had increased so much that the beaver was on the verge of extinction in Canada. Trappers, many of them inexperienced, were being drawn to the forests in higher numbers than ever before. Grey Owl argued that the only way to save the animal was to stop the influx of trappers. This was highly unlikely during the Depression, &quot;beavers [being] to the north what gold was to the west&quot;. Though the book focusses on the beaver, Grey Owl also used the animal as &quot;...representative not only of all North American Wild Life but of the wilderness itself...&quot;

He believed that Canada&#x27;s wilderness and vast open spaces, both of which were fast disappearing, were what made it unique in the world. Grey Owl also raised concerns about how the Canadian government and logging industry were working together to exploit the forests and attempt to replace them with &quot;synthetic forests&quot;, all the while projecting a false image of forest preservation.

The winter of 19311932 saw Grey Owl at work on the early chapters of &quot;Tales of an Empty Cabin&quot;, his final book, which would only be published in 1936. Anahareo, pregnant and stuck in the cabin, was fed up, later writing &quot;All I heard from Archie that winter was the scratch, scratch of his pen, and arguments against taking a bath. Like a kid, he loathed baths.&quot; On August 23, 1932, their daughter Dawn was born.

At Beaver Lodge, the third beaver film, &quot;Strange Doings in Beaverland&quot;, was shot by W. J. Oliver in August 1932. The roof of the cabin was temporarily removed to facilitate the filming of some scenes. Oliver returned in 1933 to film the fourth beaver film &quot;Grey Owl&#x27;s Neighbours&quot;, which showed Grey Owl interacting with various animals in addition to the beavers. It also showed him welcoming visitors arriving by canoe. Oliver took many photographs of Grey Owl looking &quot;consciously Indian&quot;, which were used as publicity for his lecture tours. The photographs were also used as illustrations in Grey Owl&#x27;s works. In September 1935, Grey Owl and W. J. Oliver collaborated on their final film, &quot;Pilgrims of the Wild&quot;, which showed Grey Owl and Anahareo together on a canoe trip in the bush.

From 1932 to 1934, Grey Owl worked on the autobiographical novel &quot;Pilgrims of the Wild&quot;, which was published in early 1935. Later in 1935 he finished the children&#x27;s adventure story, &quot;The Adventures of Sajo and Her Beaver People&quot;.

Leaving Dawn with a family in Prince Albert, Anahareo went alone on prospecting trips to the Churchill River area. The first trip was in the summer of 1933. The second trip lasted an entire year, from the summer of 1934 to the summer of 1935, in which she travelled by canoe to Wollaston Lake, 550 kilometers north of Prince Albert, and continued farther north to the edge of the Barren Lands. Grey Owl&#x27;s letters to her betrayed a mixed bag of emotions: admiration for her fiercely independent spirit and courage in making such an arduous trip alone, concern for her safety, envy that she could make a trip into the bush that poor health and the pressure of writing prevented him from makingalso irritation that the endeavor cost more than they could afford.

At Grey Owl&#x27;s request, Anahareo returned from the prospecting trip in the summer of 1935 to help him prepare for the upcoming lecture tour in Great Britain and to look after the beavers in his absence. She sewed his costume for the tour and later wrote:

== First tour (19351936) ==

On October 17, 1935, Grey Owl arrived at Southampton, England on the &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; from Montreal for the start of his first lecture tour in Great Britain. The tour was organized by his London publisher, Lovat Dickson, who later reported &quot;The crowds everywhere were immense and enthusiastic.&quot; So popular were the lectures that the tour, originally planned to end in 1935, was extended for two months into 1936. All told, Grey Owl gave over two hundred lectures and addressed nearly 250,000 people.

His lecture in Hastings was typical of those on the tour, beginning with words of greeting followed by a showing of &quot;Pilgrims of the Wild&quot;, a film about his life with Anahareo at Beaver Lodge. While the film ran, Grey Owl moved about the stage, telling stories about the wildlife in Canada, particularly about the beaver. &quot;He talked directly to his audience, and used no notes. His animated dialogue and his second, third and fourth films magically transported his listeners from the narrow streets of Hastings to the vast, unbroken Canadian forests.&quot;

On February 14, 1936, Grey Owl embarked at Greenock on the &quot;Duchess of Bedford&quot;, arriving in Halifax on the 21st.

== Back to Beaver Lodge (19361937) ==

Grey Owl returned to Beaver Lodge after the wildly successful British tour in the late winter of 1936. He continued to work on &quot;Tales of an Empty Cabin&quot;, which would be published later that year.

He also conceived of a new project: Having seen how much value the beaver films added to his lectures in promoting his ideas, he wanted to take a cameraman with him into the Canadian wilderness to show what it is like to travel in the bush in winter and summer. The films, along with the beaver films, would be shown during his lectures in the upcoming tour.

In March he pitched the idea to the Parks Branch, which had underwritten the five beaver films, and to a number of influential people, including the Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, but his request for funding was turned down. His publishers agreed to put up $2000 for the winter film, while Grey Owl paid the remaining costs of that film and the entire costs of the summer film out of his own pocket, commenting &quot;This picture is the dream of my life, &amp; neither Parks nor financial considerations are to stop me.&quot; The summer film was supposed to be shot that year in 1936, but the complications of getting together the equipment, rivermen and a new cameraman (W. J. Oliver, with whom Grey Owl had collaborated on the previous films, not being available) led to it being postponed to the summer of 1937.

&quot;The TrailMen Against the Snow&quot; (1937) was shot by B.J. (Bert) Bach in the Abitibi area, Quebec, where Grey Owl spent many winters trapping in the 1920s.

&quot;The Trail - Men Against the River&quot; (1937) was shot by B. J. (Bert) Bach in the Mississagi Forest Reserve, near Biscotasing, where Grey Owl worked for many years as a fire ranger in the 1910s.

In early August 1936, Grey Owl travelled to Fort Carlton, Saskatchewan, where he attended a convention of the Great Plains Indians, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the signing of Treaty 6. He participated in the &quot;huge Indian dance&quot; in &quot;his own particular style&quot; and addressed the assembly with the words: &quot;If there is anything I can do to help your cause, please let me know, I know a number of their important people in Ottawa and I know they will listen to me, again I thank you all.&quot;

Grey Owl&#x27;s tumultuous ten-year relationship with Anahareo suffered a serious rupture in April 1936, and they parted for good later that year, probably in September.

On November 9, Grey Owl spoke at the Toronto Book Fair. The venue was filled to capacity with a crowd of 1,700 people, while 500 were turned away due to lack of space. Donald B. Smith described his reception as follows:

On November 11, he addressed members and guests of the Empire Club, including many Toronto dignitaries, telling them he wants to &quot;arouse in the Canadian people a sense of responsibility they have for [the] north country and its inhabitants, human and animal&quot;.

On December 7, 1936, Grey Owl married Yvonne Perrier, a French Canadian woman he had met in Ottawa in March. They returned to Beaver Lodge on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1937.

In mid-March, the couple went to Abitibi for the shooting of the winter film. &quot;Yvonne proved the perfect helper for Grey Owl. Quickly she learned to snowshoe and although new to winter travelling, loved it, even the camping out in Abitibi in sub-zero temperatures.&quot; Grey Owl was not in such good shape: &quot;[I]n one or two shots he looks as though the work entailed was rather too much for him... By all accounts, Grey Owl was all in at the end of the day.&quot;

In early June, the couple went to Biscotasing, the start of the two-week canoe trip. Donald B. Smith writes &quot;During the arduous filming that followed on the Mississagi River, one thought sustained Archie. Life on the trail in summer would be immortalized.&quot; Despite being exhausted by the end of the trip, Grey Owl put on his own form of war dance in Bisco, which &quot;still lacked rhythm and had no Indian words in it&quot;.

In July the Indian Defense League of America invited Grey Owl to participate in the annual border crossing between Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York, as &quot;a naturalist and champion to the beauty of wild life, notably his beloved beaver&quot;. For the first time in his life, Grey Owl, supposedly raised in Arizona, stepped onto his native soil.

== Second tour (19371938) ==

Grey Owl&#x27;s second tour would take in, not only Great Britain, but also the United States and Canada. He arrived in England in October 1937, accompanied by his third wife, Yvonne, who proved to be a stabilizing influence. Donald B. Smith described the second tour as his &quot;Greatest Triumph&quot;.

Grey Owl gave a Royal Command Performance at Buckingham Palace on December 10, 1937, attended by King George VI and the young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. He began with the words &quot;You are tired with years of civilization. I come to offer youwhat? A green leaf.&quot; Grey Owl was impressed by the King, who struck him as a &quot;keen woodsman&quot;. It is reported that, in parting, Grey Owl put out his hand to the King and said &quot;Well, good-bye, Brother, and good luck to you.&quot;

After giving 140 lectures in the British stage of the tour, Grey Owl embarked for New York on December 21, arriving on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1938. In the next three months he gave 28 lectures in the United States and visited nine cities in Canada.

On March 26, 1938, Grey Owl appeared at a packed Massey Hall in Toronto. &quot;On that evening nearly three thousand Canadians gave him the greatest ovation of his life.&quot;

== Death and exposure (1938) ==

The frantic pace of the North American stage of the tour in 1938 had taken a heavy toll on Grey Owl&#x27;s health. To reach the Massey Hall lecture on March 26 in time, he and Yvonne had been on the train for seventeen hours, arriving in Toronto with two hours to spare. Despite this, he took the stage in the largest concert hall in Canada and gave the performance of his life: &quot;[F]or two hours [he] enchanted everybody. He really was superb.&quot; After the lecture they immediately boarded the Canadian Pacific transcontinental train to Regina, where on March 29 he gave the last lecture of his life.

Exhausted and run-down, Grey Owl retreated, alone, to Beaver Lodge on April 7. (Yvonne was hospitalized with exhaustion in Prince Albert.) Very ill now, he called for help three days later on April 10. He was transported to hospital in Prince Albert, where he died on April 13 at the age of 49. The park superintendent and friend, Major J.A. Wood, reported &quot;At 8.25 in the morning, he died very quietly, and pictures taken show that the congestion in his lungs [pneumonia] was very slight, which all goes to prove that he had absolutely no resistance whatever.&quot; He was buried on the ridge behind Beaver Lodge.

Upon receiving notice of his death on April 13, the North Bay &quot;Nugget&quot;, which had sat on the story for three years, ran an exposé, contending that Grey Owl was the Englishman Archie Belaney, and did not have a drop of Indian blood in him. Donald B. Smith described the resulting controversy:

Lovat Dickson spent months after his death trying to disprove the claim that Grey Owl was in fact an Englishman, going so far as to ask Anahareo to England &quot;expressly to meet Mrs. Scott-Brown, Archie&#x27;s mother, hoping that [Anahareo] would, or could, detect in her a drop of Indian blood. Of course, there wasn&#x27;t a trace&quot;. In the end she was forced to accept the truth: &quot;I had the awful feeling for all those years I had been married to a ghost, that the man who now lay buried at Ajawaan was someone I had never known, and that Archie had never really existed.&quot;

The story of how a lonely boy playing Indian in the woods behind his house in Hastings transformed himself, first into an accomplished backcountry woodsman and trapper in the Canadian wilderness, and then into the renowned author and lecturer Grey Owl, continued to fascinate and arouse controversy well after his death.

== Posthumous recognition ==

In 1972, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a documentary on Grey Owl, directed by Nancy Ryley.

In 1999, the film &quot;Grey Owl&quot;, directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Pierce Brosnan, was released. The film received mixed reviews and had no theatrical run in the United States.

In June 1997, the mayor of Hastings and the borough&#x27;s Member of Parliament Michael Foster unveiled a plaque in his honor on the house where he was born at 32 St. James Road, Hastings, East Sussex. A commemorative plaque is on the house at 36 St. Mary&#x27;s Terrace, where he grew up with his grandmother and aunts.

The Hastings Museum contains an exhibition of memorabilia and a replica of part of his Canadian lakeside cabin. The ranger station at Hastings Country Park has a commemorative plaque to Grey Owl. 

In Riding Mountain National Park, the cabin, where he resided for six months in 1931, has been designated as a Federal Heritage Building. The cabin was restored in June 2019.

In Prince Albert National Park, the cabin built in the 1930s according to his specifications still stands and is open to visitors.

== Appendices ==

=== Alcohol use ===

Belaney started drinking when he arrived in Canada as a young man. &quot;At some point during his first years in Temagami, he also discovered alcohol. Years later he said that &#x27;he wished all liquor tasted like ginger ale so he could enjoy the taste as well as the effect.&#x27; He drank for the effect.&quot; He was a lifelong drinker. &quot;If one accepts alcoholism as &#x27;recurring trouble, problems or difficulties associating with drinking,&#x27; Archie by 1930 had become an alcoholic.&quot; His favorite drink, according to Anahareo, was &quot;Johnny Dewar&#x27;s Extra Special&quot;. He would also drink vanilla extract and occasionally make his own moonshine.

At the end of the 1935 British tour, &quot;Anxious to ease the pressure of the hectic, stressful last four months, Grey Owl now wanted to drink heavily.&quot; His companion on the ship back to Canada, Betty Summervell, noticed that he smelled of onion and &quot;...thought the onion smell came from an Indian cure he was taking for his sickness&quot;. In fact, he had on board &quot;...a number of bottles of whisky, which he hid under his bunk. He drank whenever she left the cabin. Just before she returned he chewed a raw onion to banish the whisky smell. After three days of neither eating nor sleeping, the intoxicated Grey Owl looked like a ghost.&quot;

Excessive alcohol consumption compromised Grey Owl&#x27;s position with the Dominion Parks Branch in Ottawa. The photographer Yousuf Karsh had organised a dinner in his honour, at which he was supposed to meet a group of important governmental officials. However, as the dinner began, Grey Owl was absent. Karsh later found him &quot;raising a drunken row in the bar&quot;. James Harkin (the head of Parks Branch) was forced to defend Grey Owl, writing to the government&#x27;s Assistant Deputy Minister &quot;I am sorry to hear that Grey Owl has been indulging too freely in liquor. As a matter of fact, with so much Indian blood in his veins I suppose that it is inevitable that from time to time he will break out in this connection.&quot;

=== Grey Owl&#x27;s names ===

Belaney had a number of names in his life:

* Archibald Stansfeld Belaney. This was his full, legal name. He disliked &quot;Archibald&quot; and preferred to be called &quot;Archie Belaney&quot;. Even after adopting the pen name &quot;Grey Owl&quot;, he continued to use this name for legal purposes, such as employment. 

* Grey Owl. Belaney started using this as a pen and stage name in the 1930s and it is under this name that he is commonly known to the public.

* Wa-sha-quon-asin. Belaney used this pen name as well as &quot;Grey Owl&quot; in the title pages of his books. According to one source, the word &quot;Wa-sha-quon-asie&quot; (ending in &quot;e&quot; not &quot;n&quot;) means &quot;white beak owl&quot; in Ojibwe and is used to denote the screech owl, not the grey owl. Another source claims the word is &quot;Ojibwa Indian (simplified)&quot; for &quot;wenjiganooshiinh&quot; and means &quot;&#x27;great horned owl&#x27; or &#x27;great grey owl&#x27;&quot;.

* Archie Grey Owl. Belaney made some abortive attempts to avoid his legal surname by enlisting &quot;Grey Owl&quot; in that role. He tried to use this name in his Record of Employment at Prince Albert National Park. According to Smith, &quot;The civil service, however, continued unimaginatively to address him in all correspondence as &#x27;A. Bellaney&#x27;. At least they spelt his name incorrectly.&quot;

* Archie McNeil. Belaney married his third wife, Yvonne Perrier, under this name, fearing a charge of bigamy due to his undissolved marriage with his first wife. In an elaborate fiction about his past, Belaney told Yvonne his father was a George McNeil, who was third generation Scottish in the United States. His will was also drawn up in the name of &quot;Archie McNeil, familiarly known as Grey Owl&quot;.

* Ko-hom-see. This name was a nickname given to Belaney by his first wife&#x27;s family and means, according to one source, &quot;Little Owl&quot;. The family regarded him as &quot;the young owl who sits taking everything in&quot;.

* Anaquoness. This is a nickname that Belaney got during his time in Biscotasing due to the unusual Mexican sombrero he wore there. He translated the Ojibwe word as &quot;Little Hat&quot;.

=== Relationships with women ===

Belaney had known relationships with five women and fathered four known children:

*Angele Egwuna, married 1910 in Canada. Daughters Agnes Belaney, born 1911, Flora Belaney, born 1926.

*Marie Girard, relationship from 1912 to 1915 in Canada. Son Johnny Jero, born 1915.

*Ivy Holmes, married 1917 in England. Divorced 1922.

*Gertrude Bernard (Anahareo), relationship from 1925 to 1936 in Canada. Daughter Shirley Dawn, born 1932.

*Yvonne Perrier, married 1936 in Canada. (Belaney was married under the name &quot;McNeil&quot;, due to his undissolved marriage with Angele Egwuna.)

<doc id="277268" wikidata="Q122818" url="?curid=277268" title="Eugène-François Vidocq">
<text>Eugène-François Vidocq (; 24 July 1775 – 11 May 1857) was a French criminal turned criminalist, whose life story inspired several writers, including Victor Hugo, Edgar Allan Poe, and Honoré de Balzac. He was the founder and first director of France&#x27;s first criminal investigative agency, the Sûreté Nationale, as well as the head of the first known private detective agency. Vidocq is considered to be the father of modern criminology and of the French national police force. He is also regarded as the first private detective.

==Life==
Eugène François Vidocq was born in Arras, northern France, during the night of 23/24 July 1775, in the Rue du Miroir-de-Venise, now the Rue Eugène-François Vidocq. He was the third child of Henriette Françoise Vidocq (maiden name Dion, 1744–1824) and her husband, baker Nicolas Joseph François Vidocq (1744–1799).

=== Childhood and youth (1775–1795) ===
Little is known about his childhood; most of it is based on his ghost-written autobiography and a few documents in French archives. His father was well educated and, for the time, very wealthy since he was also a corn dealer. Vidocq had six siblings: two older brothers (one of whom had died before he was born), two younger brothers, and two younger sisters.

Vidocq&#x27;s teenage years were turbulent. He is described as being fearless, rowdy and cunning, very talented, but also very lazy. He spent much time in the armories (fighting halls) of Arras and acquired a reputation as a formidable fencer and the nickname &quot;le Vautrin&quot; (&quot;wild boar&quot;). By stealing, he provided himself with some level of comfort.

When Vidocq was thirteen years old, he stole his parents&#x27; silver plates and spent the proceeds from them within a day. Three days after the theft, he was arrested and brought to the local jail, &quot;Baudets&quot;. Only ten days later, he learned that his father had arranged his arrest to teach him a lesson. After a total of fourteen days, he was released from prison, but even this did not tame him.

By age fourteen, he had stolen a large amount of money from the cash box of his parents&#x27; bakery and left for Ostend, where he tried to embark to the Americas; but he was defrauded one night and found himself suddenly penniless. To survive, he worked for a group of traveling entertainers. Despite regular beatings, he worked hard enough to get promoted from stable boy to playing a Caribbean cannibal who eats raw meat. He ended up living with puppeteers to get away from them. However, he was banished from them because he flirted with the young wife of his employer. He then worked some time as an assistant of a peddler, but as soon as he neared Arras, he returned to his parents seeking forgiveness. He was welcomed by his mother with open arms.

On 10 March 1791, he enlisted in the Bourbon Regiment, where his reputation as an expert fencer was confirmed. According to Vidocq, within six months, he challenged fifteen people to a duel and killed two. Despite not being a model soldier and causing difficulties, he spent only a total of fourteen days in jail. During those two weeks, Vidocq helped a fellow inmate successfully escape.
When France declared war against Austria on 20 April 1792, Vidocq participated in the battles of the First Coalition, including the Battle of Valmy in September 1792. On 1 November 1792, he was promoted to corporal of grenadiers, but during his promotion ceremony, he challenged a fellow non-commissioned officer to a duel. This sergeant major refused the duel. So Vidocq hit him. Striking a superior officer could have led to a death sentence. So he deserted and enlisted in the 11th Chasseurs, concealing his history. On 6 November 1792, he fought under General Dumouriez in the Battle of Jemappes.

In April 1793, Vidocq was identified as a deserter. He followed a general, who was fleeing after a failed martial coup, into the enemy camp. After a few weeks, Vidocq returned to the French camp. A chasseur-captain friend interceded for him, so he was allowed to rejoin the chasseurs. Finally, he resigned from the army because he was no longer welcome.

He was eighteen years old when he returned to Arras. He soon gained a reputation as a womanizer. Since his seductions often ended in duels, he was imprisoned in &quot;Baudets&quot; from 9 January 1794 to 21 January 1795.

On 8 August 1794, when he was barely nineteen, Vidocq married Anne Marie Louise Chevalier after a pregnancy scare. No child resulted, and the marriage was not happy from the start. When Vidocq learned that his wife had cheated on him with the adjutant, Pierre Laurent Vallain, he left again for the army. He did not see his wife again until their divorce in 1805.

=== Years of wandering and prison (1795–1800) ===
Vidocq did not stay long in the army. In autumn 1794, he spent most of his time in Brussels, which was then a hideout for crooks of all kinds. There, he supported himself by small frauds. One day, he was apprehended by the police, and as a deserter, he had no valid papers. When asked for his identity, he described himself as Monsieur Rousseau from Lille and escaped while the police tried to confirm his statement.

In 1795, still under the alias of Rousseau, he joined the &quot;armée roulante&quot; (&quot;flying army&quot;). This army consisted of &quot;officers&quot; who in reality had neither commissions nor regiments. They were raiders, forging routes, ranks and uniforms but staying away from the battlefields. Vidocq began as a lieutenant of chasseurs but soon promoted himself to a hussar captain. In this role, he met a rich widow in Brussels who became fond of him. A co-conspirator of Vidocq&#x27;s convinced her that Vidocq was a young nobleman on the run because of the French Revolution. Shortly before their wedding, Vidocq confessed to her. Then he left the city, but not without a generous cash gift from her.

In March 1795, Vidocq moved to Paris, where he squandered all his money entertaining women. He went back north and joined a group of Bohemian gypsies, which he later left for a woman he had fallen in love with, Francine Longuet. When Francine left him for a real soldier, he beat both of them. The soldier sued him, and in September 1795, Vidocq was sentenced to three months in the prison &quot;Tour Saint-Pierre&quot; in Lille.

Vidocq was twenty and quickly adapted to life in prison. He befriended a group of men, among them Sebastien Boitel, who had been sentenced to six years for stealing. Then Boitel was suddenly released, but the next day, the local inspector noticed that the pardon was forged. Vidocq claimed two fellow inmates, Grouard and Herbaux, had asked to use his cell (as a soldier, Vidocq had a cell all to himself) to write something of an unknown nature because the common room was too noisy. Both inmates claimed, however, that he helped in the fabrication and that the whole thing had been his idea. Thus, Vidocq was not released after the three months.

In the following weeks, Vidocq escaped several times with the help of Francine, but was always captured soon again. After one of his escapes, Francine caught him with another woman. He disappeared for a few days, and when he was finally picked up again by police, he was told that Francine had been found with multiple knife wounds. Now, he was not only accused of forgery but also attempted murder. Francine later claimed that the wounds were self-inflicted and the charge was dropped. Vidocq&#x27;s contact with Francine stopped when she was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison for aiding the escapes.
After a long delay, his trial for document forgery began. On 27 December 1796, Vidocq and a second accused, César Herbaux, were found guilty and sentenced to eight years of hard labour.


In the prison of Bicêtre, Vidocq was to wait several months for the transfer to the Bagne in Brest to toil in the galleys. A fellow inmate taught him the martial art of savate, which was later to prove useful to him. An escape attempt on 3 October 1797 failed and precipitated his placement in a dungeon for eight days.

Finally, on 21 November, he was sent to Brest. On 28 February 1798, he escaped dressed as a sailor. Only a few days later, he was apprehended due to a lack of papers, but the police did not recognize him as an escaped convict. He claimed to be Auguste Duval, and while officials checked this claim, he was put into a prison hospital. There he stole a nun&#x27;s habit and escaped in disguise. In Cholet, he found a job as a cattle drover and, in this capacity, passed through Paris, Arras, Brussels, Ancer and finally Rotterdam, where he was shanghaied by the Dutch. After a short career as a privateer, he was arrested again and taken to Douai, where he was identified as Vidocq. He was transferred to the Bagne in Toulon, arriving on 29 August 1799. After a failed escape attempt, he escaped again on 6 March 1800 with the help of a prostitute.

=== The turnaround (1800–1811) ===
Vidocq returned to Arras in 1800. His father had died in 1799. So he hid in his mother&#x27;s house for almost half a year before he was recognized and had to flee again. He assumed the identity of an Austrian and spent some time in a relationship with a widow, with whom he moved to Rouen in 1802. Vidocq built up a reputation as a businessman and finally felt secure enough to let his mother come live with him and the widow; but finally, his past caught up with him. He was arrested and brought to Louvres. There, he learned that he had been sentenced to death in absentia. With the help of the local procurator-general, Ransom, he filed an appeal and spent the following five months in prison waiting for a retrial. During this time, Louise Chevalier contacted him to inform him of their divorce. When it seemed that there would be no decision concerning his sentence, he decided to flee again. On 28 November 1805, while unattended for a moment, he jumped out of a window into the adjacent river Scarpe. For the next four years, he was a man on the run once again.

He spent some time in Paris, where he witnessed the execution of César Herbaux, the man with whom his life had started a downward spiral. This event triggered a process of re-evaluation in Vidocq. With his mother and a woman he called Annette in his memoirs, he moved several times in the following years; but again and again, people from his past recognized him. He again tried to become a legitimate merchant, but his former wife found him in Paris and blackmailed him for money, and a couple of former fellow convicts forced him to fence stolen goods for them.
On 1 July 1809, only a few days before his 34th birthday, Vidocq was arrested again. He decided to stop living on the fringes of society and offered his services as an informant to the police. His offer was accepted, and on 20 July, he was jailed in Bicêtre, where he started his work as a spy. On 28 October, he continued his work in La Force Prison. He sounded out his inmates and forwarded his information about forged identities and unsolved crimes through Annette to the police chief of Paris, Jean Henry.

After 21 months of spying, Vidocq was released from jail on the recommendation of Henry. So as not to raise suspicions among the other inmates, the release (which took place on 25 March 1811) was arranged to look like an escape. Still, Vidocq was not really free, because now he was obliged to Henry. Therefore, he continued to work as a secret agent for the Paris police. He used his contacts and his reputation in the criminal underworld to gain trust. He disguised himself as an escaped convict and immersed himself in the criminal scene to learn about planned and committed crimes. He even took part in felonies in order to suddenly turn on his partners and arrest them. When criminals eventually began to suspect him, he used disguises and assumed other identities to continue his work and throw off suspicion.

=== The Sûreté (1811–1832) ===
At the end of 1811, Vidocq informally organized a plainclothes unit, the &quot;Brigade de Sûreté&quot; (&quot;Security Brigade&quot;). The police department recognized the value of these civil agents, and in October 1812, the experiment was officially converted to a security police unit under the Prefecture of Police. Vidocq was appointed its leader. On 17 December 1813, Emperor Napoleon I signed a decree that made the brigade a state security police force. From this day on, it was called the &quot;Sûreté Nationale&quot;.

The Sûreté initially had eight, then twelve, and, in 1823, twenty employees. A year later, it expanded again, to 28 secret agents. In addition, there were eight people who worked secretly for the Sûreté, but instead of a salary, they received licences for gambling halls. A major portion of Vidocq&#x27;s subordinates were ex-criminals like himself. He even hired them fresh from the prisons; for example, Coco Lacour, who would later become Vidocq&#x27;s successor at the Sûreté. Vidocq described his work from this period:

Vidocq personally trained his agents, for example, in selecting the correct disguise based on the kind of job. He himself still went out hunting for criminals too. His memoirs are full of stories about how he outsmarted crooks by pretending to be a beggar or an old cuckold. At one point, he even faked his own death.

During 1814, at the beginning of the French Restoration, Vidocq and the Sûreté tried to contain the situation in Paris. He also arrested those who tried to exploit the post-revolutionary situation by claiming to have been aristocrats. During 1817, he was involved in 811 arrests, including those of 15 assassins and 38 fences. By 1820, his activities had reduced crime in Paris substantially. His annual income was 5,000 francs, but he also worked as a private investigator for fees. Rumors at the time claimed that Vidocq set criminals up, organizing break-ins and robberies and having his agents wait to collect the offenders. Even though some of Vidocq&#x27;s techniques might have been questionable, there seems to be no truth to this.

Despite his position as chief of a police authority, Vidocq remained a wanted criminal. His forgery conviction had never been fully dismissed. So alongside complaints and denunciations, his superiors repeatedly received requests from the prison director of Douai, which they ignored. Finally, the Comte Jules Anglès, prefect of the Paris police, responded to a petition from Vidocq and requested an official pardon, which he received on 26 March 1817 from King Louis XVIII.
In November 1820, Vidocq married again, this time the destitute Jeanne-Victoire Guérin, whose origin is unknown, which at that time led to speculation. She came to live in the household at 111 Rue de l&#x27;Hirondelle, where Vidocq&#x27;s mother and a niece of hers, the 27-year-old Fleuride Albertine Maniez (born March 22, 1793), also lived. In 1822, Vidocq befriended the author Honoré de Balzac, who began to use him as a model for several figures in his books. Vidocq&#x27;s wife, who was ailing throughout their marriage, died in June 1824 in a hospital. Six weeks later, on 30 July 1824, Vidocq&#x27;s mother died at age 80. She was buried with honours, and her requiem was performed in Notre Dame Cathedral.

Events of the 1820s affected the police apparatus. After the assassination of the Duc de Berry in February 1820, Police Prefect Anglès had to resign and was replaced by the Jesuit Guy Delavau, who set a high value on religiousness among his subordinates. In 1824, Louis XVIII died. His successor was the ultra-reactionary Charles X, during whose oppressive reign police agents were regularly withdrawn from their original activities. Finally, Vidocq&#x27;s immediate superior, police chief Henry, retired and was succeeded by Parisot, who was soon superseded by the ambitious but also very formal Marc Duplessis. The antipathy between Vidocq and Duplessis was great. Time and time again, Duplessis complained about trivial matters, for example, that Vidocq&#x27;s agents spent time in brothels and bars of ill repute. Vidocq&#x27;s explanation that they had to do this to establish contacts and gather information was ignored. When Vidocq received two official warnings within a short time, he had had enough. On 20 June 1827, the 52-year-old handed in his resignation:

He then wrote his memoirs with the help of a ghostwriter.
Vidocq, who was a rich man after his resignation, became an entrepreneur. In Saint-Mandé, a small town east of Paris where he married his cousin Fleuride Maniez on 28 January 1830, he founded a paper factory. He mainly employed released convicts – both men and women. This caused an outrageous scandal in society and led to disputes. In addition, the machines cost money, the semi-skilled workers needed food and clothing, and the customers refused to pay market prices with the argument that he had a seemingly cheaper workforce. The company did not last long; Vidocq went bankrupt in 1831. In the short time while he was away from Paris, both Delavau and Duplessis had to resign their posts, and the July Revolution of 1830 forced Charles X to abdicate. When Vidocq delivered a few useful tips that helped to solve a burglary in Fontainebleau and led to the arrest of eight people, the new police prefect, Henri Gisquet, again appointed him chief of the Sûreté.

Criticism of Vidocq and his organization grew. The July Monarchy caused insecurities in society, and there was a cholera outbreak in 1832. One of its victims was General Jean Maximilien Lamarque. During his funeral on 5 June 1832, a revolt erupted and the throne of &quot;Citizen King&quot; Louis-Philippe I was in danger. Allegedly Vidocq&#x27;s group cracked down on the rioters with great severity. Not all of the police approved of his methods, and rivalries developed. A rumour arose that Vidocq had initiated the theft that led to his reinstatement himself to show his indispensability. One of his agents had to go to prison for two years because of that affair, but Vidocq&#x27;s involvement could not be proved. More and more defenders claimed that Vidocq and his agents were not credible as eyewitnesses, since most of them had criminal pasts themselves. Vidocq&#x27;s position was untenable, and on 15 November 1832, he once again resigned, using the pretext of his wife being ill.

On the same day, the Sûreté was dissolved, then re-established without agents with criminal records, no matter how minor their offenses. Vidocq&#x27;s successor was Pierre Allard.

=== Le bureau des renseignements (1833–1848) ===
In 1833, Vidocq founded &quot;Le bureau des renseignements&quot; (&quot;Office of Information&quot;), a company that was a mixture of a detective agency and a private police force. It is considered to be the first known detective agency. Once again, he predominantly hired ex-convicts.

His squad, which initially consisted of eleven detectives, two clerks and one secretary, pitted itself on behalf of businesspeople and private citizens against &quot;Faiseurs&quot; (crooks, fraudsters, and bankruptcy artists), occasionally using illegal means. From 1837, Vidocq quarreled constantly with the official police because of his activities and his questionable relations with various government agencies such as the War Department. On 28 November 1837, the police executed a search and seizure and confiscated over 3,500 files and documents. A few days later, Vidocq was arrested and spent Christmas and New Year in jail. He was charged with three crimes, namely the acquisition of money by deception, corruption of civil servants, and the pretension of public functions. In February 1838, after numerous witnesses had testified, the judge dismissed all three charges. Vidocq was free again.

Vidocq increasingly became the subject of literature and public discussions. Balzac wrote several novels and plays that contained characters modeled after Vidocq.
The agency flourished, but Vidocq continued to make enemies, some of them powerful. On 17 August 1842, on behalf of Police Prefect Gabriel Delessert, 75 police officers stormed his office building and arrested him and one of his agents. This time, the case seemed to be clear. In an investigation of defalcation, he had made an illegal arrest and had demanded a bill of exchange for the embezzled money from the arrested fraudster. For the next few months, 67-year-old Vidocq was remanded into custody in the Conciergerie. On 3 May 1843, the first hearings finally took place before judge Michel Barbou, a close friend of Delessert. During the trial, Vidocq had to give testimony about many other cases, among them, the kidnappings of several women whom he had allegedly delivered to monasteries against their will at the behest of their families. Also, his activities as a money lender and the possible benefits from it were examined. Finally, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 francs. Vidocq immediately appealed, and through the intervention of political friends like Count Gabriel de Berny and the attorney general, Franck-Carré, he quickly got a new trial, this time with the chief judge of the &quot;court royale&quot;. The hearing on 22 July 1843 took a matter of minutes, and after eleven months in the Conciergerie, Vidocq was free once again.

The harm was done, however. The lawsuit had been very expensive, and his reputation was damaged. Business at the agency suffered. Moreover, Delessert tried to get him expelled from the city for being a former criminal. Although the attempt failed, Vidocq increasingly considered selling his agency, but he could not find a qualified and reputable buyer.

In the following years, Vidocq published several small books in which he depicted his life to directly refute the rumours that were being circulated about him. In 1844, he presented an essay on prisons, penitentiaries, and the death penalty. On the morning of 22 September 1847, his third wife, Fleuride, died after 17 years of marriage. Vidocq did not marry again, but until his death, he had several intimate partners.

In 1848, the February revolution caused the abdication of &quot;Citizen King&quot; Louis-Philippe. The Second Republic was proclaimed, with Alphonse de Lamartine as the head of a transitional government. Although Vidocq had always been proud of his reception at the king&#x27;s court and had boasted about his access to Louis-Philippe, he offered his services to the new government. His task was the surveillance of political opponents such as Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon I. Meanwhile, the new government sank into chaos and violence. In the presidential election of 10 December 1848, Lamartine received less than 8,000 votes. Vidocq presented himself as a candidate in the 2nd Arrondissement but received only one vote. The clear winner, and thus president of the Second Republic, was Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who did not respond to Vidocq&#x27;s offer to work for him.

=== Last years (1849–1857) ===
In 1849, Vidocq briefly went to prison one last time, on a charge of fraud. In the end, however, the case was dropped. He withdrew more and more into private life and accepted only small cases every now and then. In the last years of his life, he suffered great pain in his right arm, which had been broken and had never healed properly. Unwise investments had also cost him a large portion of his assets, requiring him to curb his living standard and live in rented accommodations. In August 1854, despite a pessimistic prognosis by his doctor, he survived a bout of cholera. Only in April 1857 did his condition deteriorate to the point he could no longer stand. On 11 May 1857, Vidocq died at the age of 81 in his home in Paris in the presence of his doctor, his lawyer and a priest.


His body was brought to the church of Saint-Denys du Saint-Sacrement, where the funeral service was held. It is not known where Vidocq is buried, though there are some rumours as to the location. One of them, mentioned in the biography of Philip John Stead, claims that his grave is at the cemetery in Saint Mandé. There is a gravestone with the inscription &quot;Vidocq 18&quot;. According to information from city officials, however, this grave is registered to Vidocq&#x27;s last wife, Fleuride-Albertine Maniez.

In the end, his assets consisted of 2,907.50 francs from the sale of his goods and a pension of 867.50 francs. A total of eleven women came forward as owners of his testament, a document which they had received for their favours instead of presents. His remaining assets went to Anne-Heloïse Lefèvre, at whose house he had lived at the end of his life. Although Vidocq had no known children, Emile-Adolphe Vidocq, the son of his first wife, tried to get recognized as his son (even changing his last name for this purpose), but failed. Vidocq had left evidence which ruled out his paternity: he had been in prison at the time of Emile-Adolphe Vidocq&#x27;s conception.

== Criminology legacy ==
Vidocq is considered by historians as the &quot;father&quot; of modern criminology. His approaches were new and unique for that time. However, it should be said that a famous predecessor Antoine de Sartine who organised the secret police under the monarchy before the French Revolution influenced other governments of Europe, Catherine II of Russia, Maria Theresa of Austria, and the Pope. De Sartine is portrayed in the fictional detective French TV series Nicolas Le Floch. Nonetheless, Vidocq is credited with the introduction of undercover work, ballistics, criminology and a record keeping system to criminal investigation. He made the first plaster cast impressions of shoe prints. He created indelible ink and unalterable bond paper with his printing company. His form of anthropometrics is still partially used by French police. He is also credited with philanthropic pursuits – he claimed he never informed on anyone who had stolen out of real need.

At the same time, his work was not acknowledged in France for a long time because of his criminal past. In September 1905, the Sûreté Nationale exhibited a painting series with its former heads. However, the first painting of the series showed Pierre Allard, Vidocq&#x27;s successor. The newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Exclusive&quot; reported on 17 September 1905 that on obtaining information concerning the omission, they had received the answer that Vidocq had never been head of the Sûreté.

=== Remodelling of the police force ===
When Vidocq gave his allegiance to the police around 1810, there were two police organizations in France: on the one side, there was the &quot;police politique&quot;, an intelligence agency whose agents were responsible for the detection of conspiracies and intrigues; on the other, the normal police, who investigated common crimes such as theft, fraud, prostitution, and murder. Since the Middle Ages, those constables wore identification insignia that, over time, had developed to full uniforms. Unlike the often covertly operating political police, they were easy to spot. For fear of attack, they did not dare to enter some Parisian districts, limiting their efforts at crime prevention.

Vidocq persuaded his superiors to allow his agents, who also included women, to wear plain clothes and disguises depending on the situation. Thus, they did not attract attention and, as former criminals, also knew the hiding places and methods of criminals. Through their contacts, they often learned of planned crimes and were able to catch the guilty red-handed. Vidocq also had a different approach to interrogation. In his memoirs, he mentions several times that he did not take those arrested to prison immediately, but invited them to dinner, where he chatted with them. In addition to information about other crimes, he often obtained confessions in this non-violent way and recruited future informants and even agents.

August Vollmer, the first police chief of Berkeley, California, and a leading figure in the development of criminal justice in the United States, studied the works of Vidocq and the Austrian criminal jurist Hans Gross for his reform of the Berkeley police force. His reform ideas were adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and, as a result, also affected J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI. After Robert Peel established Scotland Yard in 1829, he sent a committee to Paris in 1832 to confer with Vidocq for several days. In 1843, two commissars of Scotland Yard traveled to Paris for further training. They spent only two days with Pierre Allard, who was head of the Sûreté by then. Then they went to Vidocq&#x27;s private agency and, for one week, accompanied him and his agents in their work.

=== Identification of criminals ===

Jürgen Thorwald stated in his book &quot;Das Jahrhundert der Detektive&quot; (1964) that Vidocq had a photographic memory that allowed him to recognize previously convicted criminals, even in disguise. Biographer Samuel Edwards reported in &quot;The Vidocq Dossier&quot; about a trial against the fraudster and forger Lambert, in which Vidocq referred to his memory of the accused. Vidocq regularly visited the prisons to memorise the faces of the inmates and made his agents do the same. The English police adopted this method. Until the late 1980s, British investigators attended court hearings to observe the spectators in the public galleries and become aware of possible accomplices.

As Vidocq said at Lambert&#x27;s trial, while his memory was phenomenal, he could not require the same of his agents. Therefore, for each arrested person, he carefully set up an index card with a personal description, aliases, previous convictions, modus operandi, and other information. The card of forger Lambert contained, among other things, a handwriting sample. The index card system was retained not only by the French police, but also by police units in other countries. However, it soon revealed its weaknesses. By the time Alphonse Bertillon came to the Sûreté as clerk in 1879, the descriptions on the cards were not detailed enough anymore to really identify suspects. This caused Bertillon to develop an anthropometric system for personal identification called the bertillonage. The sorting of the card boxes, which by then already filled several rooms, was converted to body dimensions, the first of many attempts to improve the structure of the sorting. With the advent of the information age, the cards were digitised, and the card boxes were replaced by databases.

=== Scientific experiments ===
Forensic science did not yet exist during Vidocq&#x27;s time. Despite numerous scientific papers, the police did not recognize its practical benefits, and this could not be changed by Vidocq. Nevertheless, he was not so averse to experiments as his superiors and usually had a small laboratory set up in his office building. In the archives of the Parisian police are reports of cases that he solved by applying forensic methods decades before they were recognized as such.

; Chemical compounds
: In the France of Vidocq&#x27;s time, there already existed cheques and promissory notes. Counterfeiters purchased those cheques and altered them to their advantage. In 1817, Vidocq addressed this problem by commissioning two chemists to develop a tamper-proof paper. This paper, for which Vidocq filed a patent, was treated with chemicals that would smear the ink if later amended and thus make the forgeries identifiable. According to the biographer Edwards, Vidocq used his connections extensively, recommending his paper to those who had been deceived, mainly bankers who hired him. Therefore, the paper came to be widely used. Vidocq also used it for the cards of his index card system to emphasize their reliability in court. He also commissioned the creation of indelible ink. This ink has been used, among other things, by the French government for the printing of banknotes from the mid-1860s.
; Crime scene investigation
: Louis Mathurin Moreau-Christophe, contemporary general director of French prisons, described in his book &quot;Le monde des coquins&quot; (&quot;The World of Scoundrels&quot;) how Vidocq used clues from the crime scene to determine the perpetrator based on his knowledge of specific criminals and their modus operandi. As a concrete example, Moreau named a burglary in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in 1831, where he himself had been present at the investigation. Vidocq inspected a door panel that had been damaged by the offender and said that, due to the method employed and the perfection with which it had been executed, he knew of only one perpetrator who could have done it. He suggested the thief Fossard but mentioned that he could not be the culprit, since he was still in prison. The police chief, Lecrosnier, who was also present, told them that Fossard had escaped eight days before. Two days later, Vidocq arrested Fossard, who had in fact committed the burglary.
; Ballistics
: Alexandre Dumas left records that describe a murder case from 1822. The Comtesse Isabelle d&#x27;Arcy, a woman much younger than her husband on whom she had cheated, was shot dead, whereupon the police arrested the Comte d&#x27;Arcy. Vidocq talked with him and was of the opinion that the &quot;old gentleman&quot; did not have the personality of a murderer. He examined his dueling pistols and found that they either had not been fired or had been cleaned since then. Then he persuaded a doctor to remove the bullet from the head of the noblewoman secretly. A simple comparison showed that the bullet was too big to come from the guns of the Comte. Vidocq then searched the apartment of the woman&#x27;s lover and found not only numerous pieces of jewellery, but also a large pistol whose size fit the bullet. The Comte identified the jewels as those of his wife and Vidocq also found a fence to whom the lover had already sold a ring. Confronted with the evidence, the lover confessed to the murder.The first real comparison between a gun and a bullet took place in 1835 by the Bow Street Runner Henry Goddard. On 21 December 1860, &quot;The Times&quot; reported on a court ruling in which a murderer in Lincoln named Thomas Richardson had been convicted with the help of ballistics for the first time.

=== The Vidocq Society ===
In 1990, the &quot;Vidocq Society&quot; was founded in Philadelphia by forensic artist/sculptor Frank Bender (d. 2011). Its members are forensic experts, FBI profilers, homicide investigators, scientists, psychologists, coroners, and any other competent professionals. At their monthly meetings, they try to solve cold cases from around the world, free of charge and in accordance with their motto &quot;Veritas veritatum&quot; (&quot;Truth generates truth&quot;). The rolls of membership are closed and the number of members remains low enough to never exceed the number of years of Vidocq&#x27;s life.

==Depictions of Vidocq==
=== Literature ===
In 1829, two journalists under the pseudonym of a criminal named Malgaret published the book &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un forçat ou Vidocq dévoilé&quot; to expose criminal activities Vidocq allegedly had committed. Other police officers followed the example of Vidocq&#x27;s memoirs and published their own autobiographies in the following years, among them the prefect of police, Henri Gisquet.

Vidocq&#x27;s life story inspired many contemporary writers, many of them his closest friends. In Balzac&#x27;s writings, he was regularly the model of literary figures: his experiences as a failed entrepreneur were used in the third part of &quot;Illusions perdues&quot;, &quot;Les Souffrances de l&#x27;inventeur&quot;; in &quot;Gobseck&quot;, Balzac introduced the policeman Corentin; but most clearly, the connection to Vidocq can be found in the figure of Vautrin. This character first appears in the novel &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot;, then in &quot;Illusions perdues&quot;, &quot;Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes&quot; (as the main character), &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;, &quot;Le Contrat de mariage&quot;, and finally as the main character in the 1840 theatre play &quot;Vautrin&quot;. Not only Vidocq as a person but also his methods and disguises inspired Balzac in his work.

In Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1862), both main characters, the reformed criminal Jean Valjean and Police Inspector Javert, were modeled after Vidocq, as was the policeman Monsieur Jackal in &quot;The Mohicans of Paris&quot; (1854–1855) by Alexandre Dumas. He also was the basis for &quot;Rodolphe de Gerolstein&quot;, who secured justice in the serial newspaper novel &quot;The Mysteries of Paris&quot; of Eugène Sue in the weekly newspaper &quot;Journal des débats&quot;; and he was the inspiration of Émile Gaboriau for &quot;Monsieur Lecoq&quot;, one of the first scientific and methodical investigators who played the lead role in many adventures, who in turn was a major influence for the creation of Sherlock Holmes. It is also believed that Edgar Allan Poe was prompted by a story about Vidocq to create the first detective in fiction, C. Auguste Dupin, who appeared, for example, in the short story &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, which is considered the first detective story. Vidocq is also mentioned in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (&quot;Chapter 88: Schools and Schoolmasters&quot;) and &quot;White Jacket&quot; (&quot;Chapter VI: The Quarterdeck Officers, etc.&quot;) by Herman Melville and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; by Charles Dickens.

In the Sandman Slim series of urban fantasy books by Richard Kadrey, a fictionalized version of Vidocq is a friend and mentor to the protagonist James Stark. Kadrey&#x27;s Vidocq has become immortal thanks to an alchemical accident and lives in modern-day Los Angeles.

Another contemporary novel that features Vidocq is Louis Bayard&#x27;s &quot;The Black Tower&quot; (2008), though it is set in Restoration France.

Vidocq also appears as a major character in James McGee&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebellion&quot; (2011)

Vidocq is frequently alluded to in Burt Solomon&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;The Murder of Willie Lincoln.&quot;

=== Theatre ===

Vidocq was a friend of the theater. During his lifetime, the Boulevard du Crime, a road with several theatres that regularly presented crime stories in the form of melodramas, was quite popular. One of these theatres was the Théâtre de l&#x27;Ambigu-Comique, which was sponsored by Vidocq to a great extent. According to the biographer James Morton, Vidocq also submitted a play, but it was never produced. He also had plans to dabble in play acting but never carried them out.

Not only were many of Vidocq&#x27;s paramours actresses, but many of his friends and acquaintances were also from the theatre scene. Among them was the famous actor Frédérick Lemaître, who among other things played the main role in Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Vautrin&quot;, a play which debuted on 14 March 1840 at Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin after numerous problems with censorship. Lemaître tried to adapt his appearance to that of Vidocq, on whom the character Vautrin was based. At the premiere, there were commotions because the wig Lemaître had used was also similar to the one of King Louis-Philippe. The play was banned by the French interior minister after that and not performed again.

It was not only plays inspired by Vidocq that were shown in the theatre. His one life story also made it on stage several times, usually with his memoirs as a literary template. Especially in England, there was great enthusiasm for Vidocq. The memoirs had been rapidly translated into English, and a few months later, on 6 July 1829, the premiere of &quot;Vidocq! The French Police Spy&quot; was held at Surrey Theatre in the London Borough of Lambeth. The melodrama in two acts, produced by Robert William Elliston, was penned by Douglas William Jerrold, and the main character was played by TP Cooke. Although the critics, among them one from &quot;The Times&quot;, were quite positive, the play was performed only nine times in the first month and then dropped.

In December 1860, some years after Vidocq&#x27;s death, another play about him, written by F. Marchant, was presented in Britannia Theatre in Hoxton under the title &quot;Vidocq or The French Jonathan Wild&quot;. It was included in the theatre program for only one week.

In 1909, Émile Bergerat wrote the melodrama &quot;Vidocq, empereur des policiers&quot; in five acts and seven scenes. The producers Hertz and Coquelin rejected it, but Bergerat sued them successfully for 8,000 francs in damages. The play debuted in 1910 in Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt. Jean Kemm, who years later would also participate in a movie about Vidocq, took over the lead role.

=== Film ===

A film based on Vidocq&#x27;s memoirs was released in France on 13 August 1909, a short black-and-white silent film &quot;La Jeunesse de Vidocq ou Comment on devient policier&quot;. Vidocq was played by Harry Baur, who also portrayed him in two sequels: &quot;L&#x27;Évasion de Vidocq&quot; (1910) and &quot;Vidocq&quot; (1911). Under the direction of Jean Kemm, the silent movie &quot;Vidocq&quot; based on the memoirs appeared in 1922. The screenplay was written by Arthur Bernède and the main role was played by René Navarre. The first sound film, again entitled &quot;Vidocq&quot;, appeared in 1939. Jacques Daroy directed André Brulé in the title role. The film focused largely on Vidocq&#x27;s criminal career.

On 19 July 1946, the first American film about Vidocq appeared – &quot;A Scandal in Paris&quot;, with George Sanders as Vidocq and direction by Douglas Sirk. It showed the rise of a rogue in society, coupled with a love story. It was followed in April 1948 by the next French version of Vidocq&#x27;s life story, &quot;The Cavalier of Croix-Mort&quot;, directed by Lucien Ganier-Raymond with Henri Nassiet in the lead.

On 7 January 1967, the French television station ORTF showed the first of two television series, each with thirteen episodes. &quot;Vidocq&quot; starring Bernard Noël was still in black and white. The second series, &quot;Les Nouvelles Aventures de Vidocq&quot;, the first in color, premiered on 5 January 1971 and starred Claude Brasseur.

In 1989, the pilot episode &quot;Footprint&quot; was devoted to Eugène Vidocq. The series was called &quot;Adventure of Criminalistics&quot; and was filmed in a Czechoslovakian–German co-production.

In 2001, under the direction of Pitof, Gérard Depardieu played Vidocq in the French science fiction film &quot;Vidocq&quot;.

In 2018, Jean-Francois Richet directed a film with Vincent Cassel as Vidocq, &quot;The Emperor of Paris&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Empereur de Paris&quot;).

=== Comics ===

Vidocq&#x27;s life inspired a comics series by Dutch artist Hans G. Kresse, which was published in the magazine &quot;Pep&quot; between 1965 and 1969. It was a realistic adventure series set during the Napoleonic era, where Vidocq is portrayed as a detective with a criminal past.

=== Video games ===

Vidocq appears as a playable character in the adventure mystery game &quot;Inspector Javert and the Oath of Blood&quot;.

==Writings ==
Around 1827, Vidocq wrote an autobiography, which he planned for the bookseller Émile Morice to publish in summer 1828. Honoré de Balzac, Victor Hugo, and Alexandre Dumas thought that the story was too short. So Vidocq found a new publisher, Louis-François L&#x27;Héritier. In December 1828, L&#x27;Héritier published the memoirs, which had grown to four volumes through the help of some ghostwriters. The work became a bestseller and sold over 50,000 copies in the first year.

<text>George Dupre (1903–1982) was a Canadian man who falsely claimed to have been a Special Operations Executive operative during World War II.

In 1953, Quentin Reynolds, an ex-war correspondent, had written a book &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Talk&quot; about George Dupre&#x27;s alleged wartime experiences. Dupre claimed that he had been working for Special Operations Executive and the French Resistance during World War II. He had masqueraded as a village idiot and had been captured and tortured by the Gestapo. He had been telling his story in Canadian service clubs and Boy Scout meetings for years. Any loopholes in his story he (and his listeners) attributed to wartime trauma and still existing security restrictions.

Random House published the book and it appeared in November 1953. There was also a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; condensation. Dupre himself said he wanted no money, that only the message to trust in God was important. He gave the money to Scouts Canada. The book was a sensation.

The hoax began to unravel when a retired Royal Canadian Air Force officer appeared at the offices of the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;. He had served with Dupre in Winnipeg in 1943, when Dupre claimed he was working undercover in France. Three other officers stated that they had sailed with him to Britain at the same time.

&quot;Calgary Herald&quot; reporter Douglas Collins, himself a former intelligence man, tricked Dupre by dropping fictitious names Dupre claimed to recognize. Eventually Dupre confessed. Reynolds was rather disappointed and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; published a three-page retraction. Unfazed, Random House representative Bennett Cerf recommended that stores move the book to the fiction section. The book continued to sell well.

<text>Louis De Rougemont (12 November 1847 – 9 June 1921) was a Swiss explorer who claimed to have had adventures in Australasia.

==Personal history==
&quot;De Rougemont&quot; was born Henri Louis Grin in 1847 in Gressy, Vaud, Switzerland. He left home at the age of sixteen. He became a footman to the actress Fanny Kemble, servant to a Swiss banker de Mieville in 1870 and a butler for the Governor of Western Australia, Sir William Robinson. In the latter job he lasted less than a year.

He tried various ventures with very little success. He worked as a doctor, a &quot;spirit photographer&quot; and an inventor. He also married and abandoned a wife in Australia.

In 1898 he began to write about his invented adventures in the British periodical &quot;The Wide World Magazine&quot; under the name Louis De Rougemont. He described his alleged exploits in search of pearls and gold in New Guinea, and claimed to have spent thirty years living with Indigenous Australians in the outback. He claimed that the tribe with whom he had lived had worshipped him as a god. He also claimed to have encountered the Gibson expedition of 1874.

Various readers expressed disbelief in his tales from the start, for example, claiming that no one can actually ride a turtle. De Rougemont had also claimed to have seen flying wombats. The fact that he could not place his travels on a map aroused suspicion. Readers&#x27; arguments in the pages of the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; and other London newspapers continued for months.

Rougemont subjected himself to examination by the Royal Geographical Society. He claimed that he could not specify exactly where he had been because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with a syndicate that wanted to exploit the gold he had found in the area. He also refused to talk about Aboriginal languages he had supposedly learned. Still his supporters continued to find precedents for his exploits.

In September 1898 the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; announced that a certain F.W. Solomon had recognized De Rougemont and identified him as Louis Grin, who had presented himself at Solomon&#x27;s firm as an entrepreneur. Grin had collected tidbits for his exploits from the Reading Room of the British Museum. Edwin Greenslade Murphy had helped to expose him.

Grin tried to defend himself by writing a letter to &quot;The Daily Chronicle&quot;, using his original name, in which he expressed his consternation that anybody would confuse him with Louis De Rougemont. The &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; was very willing to publish the letter. &quot;The Wide World Magazine&quot; exploited the situation and prepared a Christmas double issue. Sales of both papers increased greatly. De Rougemont himself disappeared from view.

During 1899 Grin travelled to South Africa as a music-hall attraction, &quot;the greatest liar on Earth&quot;. On a similar tour of Australia in 1901 he was booed from the stage. In July 1906 he appeared at the London Hippodrome and successfully demonstrated his turtle-riding skills. During the First World War he reappeared as an inventor of a useless meat substitute. He died a poor man in London on 9 June 1921.

G.K. Chesterton gave an account of a meeting he had with Grin in his 1927 philosophical work “The Everlasting Man”. The encounter opens Part 1, Chapter 8 ‘The End of the World’.

It was said of the would-be adventurer:

<text>Harry Domela (1905 – 4 October 1979) was a Russian-born impostor who pretended to be a deposed German crown prince.

==Biography==
Harry Domela was born to German parents in 1905 in Kurland, Russian Empire. At the age of fifteen he fought in the first Freikorps against Baltic rebels. He moved to Germany after World War I. His brothers and his father had died in the war.

Domela was too young to join the army corps after the war and thus held numerous menial jobs. At this same time he was imprisoned several times for his experimenting with impostures of various titles including Baron Korff.

His big break came when he went to Heidelberg and impressed himself on the members of German nobility who had been stripped of their official titles by the Weimar Republic. He presented himself as &quot;Prince Lieven of Latvia&quot;, but managed to create an impression that this was only part of the truth. Aristocrats noticed his resemblance to Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, grandson of the deposed Wilhelm II, German Emperor. In no time, upper class circles were rife with rumors that he was in fact the heir of the German throne who was traveling .

As a result, when he travelled in Thuringia and Prussia local pro-monarchy dignitaries and businessmen entertained him at their own expense. He never asked for or received money from them. Soon however he began to attract the attention of the press and thus suspected that his imposture would soon be over. Eventually he decided to leave for France to try to join the French Foreign Legion. He was arrested when he was boarding the train.

For the next seven months he was in prison in Cologne, waiting for his trial. He used this time to write the narrative of his experiences, &quot;A Sham Prince: The Life and Adventures of Harry Domela as Written by Himself in Prison at Cologne, January to June 1927&quot;. In the trial, the court ruled that his imposture had been harmless and he was acquitted of the charges.

Domela&#x27;s book sold well, and soon he had sold the movie rights to it. There were two plays about his life; in one he played himself (he sued the actor who played him in the other one, but lost the lawsuit). In 1927 he starred in a film &quot;The False Prince&quot;, based on his own experiences. However, by 1930 he had disappeared from the public life.

Domela left Germany for the Netherlands in 1933 and lived with false papers as &quot;Victor Zsajka&quot;. He befriended Dutch author Jef Last who acquainted him with André Gide. Domela served with Last in the Spanish Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War. Afterwards he stayed in Belgium until he moved to France where he was interned by the Vichy France regime. Gide helped him to leave for Mexico.

Domela later resurfaced as a teacher in Venezuela and contacted Jef Last in 1965. After last being seen in 1978 according to research by Weimar-based scholar Jens Kirsten, Domela died in 1979 in Maracaibo.

<text>Henri Honoré Giraud (; 18 January 1879 – 11 March 1949) was a French military officer who was a leader of the Free French Forces during the Second World War until he was forced to retire in 1944.

Born to an Alsatian family in Paris, Giraud graduated from the Saint-Cyr military academy and served in French North Africa. He was wounded and captured by the Germans during the First World War, but managed to escape from his prisoner-of-war camp. During the interwar period, Giraud returned to North Africa and fought in the Rif War, for which he was awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

Early in the Second World War, Giraud fought in the Netherlands. In May 1940, he was again captured by the Germans, but made another successful escape from captivity in April 1942 after two years of careful planning. From within Vichy France he worked with the Allies in secret, and assumed command of French troops in North Africa after Operation Torch (November 1942) following the assassination of François Darlan. In January 1943, he took part in the Casablanca Conference along with Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Later in the same year, Giraud and de Gaulle became co-presidents of the French Committee of National Liberation, but he lost support and retired in frustration in April 1944.

After the war, Giraud was elected to the Constituent Assembly of the French Fourth Republic. He died in Dijon in 1949.

== Early life ==
Henri Giraud was born in Paris, of Alsatian descent, and was the son of a coal merchant.

== Military career ==
Giraud graduated from the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in 1900 and joined the French Army as a sub-lieutenant in the 4th Zouaves. In 1907, he qualified for admission to the &quot;École supérieure de guerre&quot;, and on 10 December was transferred to the 27th Infantry. Having successfully qualified as a staff officer, Giraud was appointed to the staff of the 9th Army Corps on 13 October 1909. On 23 October 1911, he was appointed to the staff of the 1st Brigade of Cuirassiers. Due to the slow pace of promotion in the peacetime army, Giraud only received a brevet promotion to captain on 23 December 1912, over a decade after his promotion to lieutenant. On 23 June 1913, Giraud returned to the 4th Zouaves, and commanded Zouave troops in North Africa until he was transferred back to France in 1914 when World War I broke out.

=== World War I ===
Giraud was seriously wounded while leading a Zouave bayonet charge during the Battle of St. Quentin on 30 August 1914, and was left for dead on the field. He was captured by the Germans and placed in a prison camp in Belgium. Giraud managed to escape two months later by pretending to be a roustabout with a traveling circus. He then asked Edith Cavell for help, and eventually he was able to return to France via the Netherlands, with assistance from Cavell&#x27;s team. Giraud&#x27;s feat earned him appointment as a knight of the Legion of Honour on 10 April 1915. With effect from 26 February 1915, he was reappointed a staff officer.

Afterwards, Giraud served with French troops in Istanbul under General Franchet d&#x27;Esperey.

===Interwar period===
In 1920 Giraud was transferred to Morocco to fight against Rif rebels. He was awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; after the capture of Abd-el-Krim (1926). On 20 October 1927, by now a brevet colonel with the 5th Infantry, he was appointed professor of infantry tactics at the École de Guerre, where one of his students was Captain Charles de Gaulle. On 3 February 1930, Giraud was &quot;placed at the disposal of the resident-general of France in Morocco&quot;, then Lucien Saint, and was assigned to monitor the Algerian-Moroccan borders as commander of the Moroccan frontier post of Boudenib. He was promoted to brigadier-general on 22 December 1930. On 11 April 1936, he was appointed military governor of Metz, commanding the 6th military region.

=== World War II: command, capture and escape ===
When World War II began, Giraud was a member of the Superior War Council, and disagreed with Charles de Gaulle about the tactics of using armoured troops. He became the commander of the 7th Army when it was sent to the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and was able to delay German troops at Breda on 13 May. Subsequently, the depleted 7th Army was merged with the 9th. While trying to block a German attack through the Ardennes, he was at the front with a reconnaissance patrol when he was captured by German troops at Wassigny on 19 May. A court-martial tried Giraud for ordering the execution of two German saboteurs wearing civilian clothes but he was acquitted and taken to Königstein Castle near Dresden, which was used as a high-security POW prison.

Giraud planned his escape carefully over two years. He learned German and memorised a map of the area. He made a rope out of twine, torn bedsheets, and copper wire, which friends had smuggled into the prison for him. Using a simple code embedded in his letters home, he informed his family of his plans to escape. On 17 April 1942, he lowered himself down the cliff of the mountain fortress. He had shaved off his moustache and wearing a Tyrolean hat, travelled to Schandau to meet his Special Operations Executive (SOE) contact who provided him with a change of clothes, cash and identity papers. Through various ruses, he reached the Swiss border by train. To avoid border guards who were on the alert for him, he walked through the mountains until he was stopped by two Swiss soldiers, who took him to Basel. Giraud eventually slipped into Vichy France, where he made his identity known. He tried to convince Marshal Philippe Pétain that Germany would lose, and that France must resist the German occupation. His views were rejected but the Vichy government refused to return Giraud to the Germans.

=== Cooperation with the Allies ===

Giraud&#x27;s escape soon became known throughout France. The Vichy Prime Minister, Pierre Laval, tried to persuade him to return to Germany. Yet while remaining loyal to Pétain and the Vichy government, Giraud refused to cooperate with the Germans. In retaliation, Heinrich Himmler ordered the Gestapo to try to assassinate him and to arrest any members of Giraud&#x27;s family who could be found, with the intention of holding them hostage in order to discourage Giraud from cooperating with the Allies. Seventeen members of Giraud&#x27;s extended family were arrested.

Allied authorities secretly contacted Giraud, giving him the code name &quot;Kingpin&quot;. Giraud was already planning for the day when American troops landed in France. He agreed to support an Allied landing in French North Africa, provided that only American troops were used (like many other French officers he was bitterly resentful of the British, particularly after their attack on Mers-el-Kébir), and that he or another French officer was the commander of such an operation. He considered this latter condition essential to maintaining French sovereignty and authority over the Arab and Berber natives of North Africa.

Giraud designated General Charles Mast as his representative in Algeria. A secret meeting on 23 October 1942 with U.S. General Mark W. Clark and the American diplomat Robert Daniel Murphy agreed on the invasion, but the Americans promised only that Giraud would be in command &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. Giraud, still in France, responded with a demand for a written commitment that he would be commander within 48 hours of the landing, and for landings in France as well as North Africa. Giraud also insisted that he could not leave France before 20 November.

However, Giraud was persuaded that he had to move. He requested to be fetched by airplane, but General Dwight Eisenhower advised that he should be brought to Gibraltar by the British submarine , masquerading as &quot;USS &quot;Seraph&quot;&quot; under the nominal command of American Captain Jerauld Wright, as no US submarines were operating in the vicinity. On 5 November, he and his two sons were picked up near Toulon by HMS &quot;Seraph&quot; and taken to meet Eisenhower in Gibraltar. He arrived on 7 November, only a few hours before the landings.

Eisenhower asked him to assume command of French troops in North Africa during Operation Torch and to order them to join the Allies. But Giraud had expected to command the whole operation, and adamantly refused to participate on any other basis. He said &quot;his honor would be tarnished&quot; and that he would only be a spectator in the affair.

However, by the next morning, Giraud relented. He refused to leave immediately for Algiers, but rather stayed in Gibraltar until 9 November. When asked why he did not go to Algiers he replied: &quot;You may have seen something of the large De Gaullist demonstration that was held here last Sunday. Some of the demonstrators sang the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;. I entirely approve of that! Others sang the &quot;Chant du départ&quot; [a military ballad]. Quite satisfactory! Others again shouted &#x27;Vive de Gaulle!&#x27; No objection. But some of them cried &#x27;Death to Giraud!&#x27; I don&#x27;t approve of that at all.&quot;

Pro-Allied elements in Algeria had agreed to support the Allied landings, and in fact seized Algiers on the night of 7–8 November; the city was subsequently occupied by Allied troops. However, pro-Vichy resistance continued at Oran and Casablanca. Giraud flew to Algiers on 9 November, but his attempt to assume command of French forces was rebuffed; his broadcast directing French troops to cease resistance and to join the Allies was ignored. Instead, it appeared that Admiral François Darlan, who happened to be in Algiers, had real authority, and Giraud quickly realized this. Despite the fact that Darlan was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Vichy government, the Allies recognized him as head of French forces in Africa, and on 10 November, after agreeing to a deal, Darlan ordered the French forces to cease fire and to co-operate with the Allies.

On 11 November, German forces occupied southern France. Negotiations continued in Algiers, and by 13 November, the Allies recognized Darlan as High Commissioner of French North Africa and West Africa, while Giraud was appointed commander of all French forces under Darlan.

All this took place without reference to the Free French organization of Charles De Gaulle, which had claimed to be the legitimate government of France in exile.

Then on 24 December 1942, Darlan was assassinated in Algiers in mysterious circumstances. On that afternoon, the admiral drove to his offices at the Palais d&#x27;Été and was shot down at the door to his bureau by a young man of 20, Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a monarchist who was tried by court martial under Giraud&#x27;s orders and executed on the 26th. With the strong backing of the Allies, especially Eisenhower, Giraud was elected to succeed Darlan.

=== Army of Africa leader ===
After Admiral Darlan&#x27;s assassination, Giraud became his &quot;de facto&quot; successor with Allied support. This occurred through a series of consultations between Giraud and Charles de Gaulle. De Gaulle wanted to pursue a political position in France and agreed to have Giraud as commander-in-chief, as the more militarily qualified of the two. Giraud took part in the Casablanca conference, with Roosevelt, Churchill and de Gaulle, in January 1943. Later, after very difficult negotiations, Giraud agreed to suppress the racist laws, and to liberate Vichy prisoners from the South Algerian concentration camps. Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle then became co-presidents of the French Committee of National Liberation and Free French Forces. Giraud wanted to keep all racial laws. In the US, he praised the achievements of Nazi Germany. The Cremieux decree was only restored by General de Gaulle. De Gaulle consolidated his political position at Giraud&#x27;s expense because he was more up to date with the political situation. Giraud went to the U.S. in July on a useless trip while de Gaulle gained strength. Giraud made a fool of himself in Detroit with a speech praising Nazi achievements in Germany.
Following the Resistance uprising in Corsica on 11 September 1943, Giraud sent an expedition, including two French destroyers, to help the resistance movement without informing the committee. This drew more criticism from de Gaulle, and he lost the co-presidency in November 1943.

When the Allies found out that Giraud was maintaining his own intelligence network, the French committee forced him from his post as a commander-in-chief of the French forces. He refused to accept a post of Inspector General of the Army and chose to retire after forty-four years&#x27; service. On 10 March 1944 he received a telegram from Winston Churchill offering Churchill&#x27;s sympathy for the death of Giraud&#x27;s daughter who had been captured in Tunisia, and carried off into Germany with her four children. On 28 August 1944, he survived an assassination attempt in Algeria.

== Postwar life ==
On 2 June 1946, Giraud was elected to the French Constituent Assembly as a representative of the Republican Party of Liberty and helped to create the constitution of the Fourth Republic. He remained a member of the War Council and was decorated for his escape. Giraud published two books, &quot;Mes Evasions&quot; (&quot;My Escapes&quot;, 1946) and &quot;Un seul but, la victoire: Alger 1942–1944&quot; (&quot;A Single Goal, Victory: Algiers 1942–1944&quot;, 1949) about his experiences.

Henri Giraud died in Dijon, France, on 11 March 1949.

<doc id="277277" wikidata="Q1140735" url="?curid=277277" title="Lili Elbe">
<text>Lili Ilse Elvenes (28 December 1882 – 13 September 1931), better known as Lili Elbe, was a Danish painter, transgender woman, and one of the earliest recipients of gender-affirming surgery (then called sex reassignment surgery).

She was a painter under her birth name Einar Wegener. After transitioning in 1930, she changed her legal name to Lili Ilse Elvenes, stopped painting, and later adopted the surname Elbe. She was the first known recipient of a uterus transplant in an attempt to achieve pregnancy, but died due to the subsequent complications.

The UK and US versions of her semi-autobiographical narrative were published posthumously in 1933 under the title &quot;Man into Woman: An Authentic Record of a Change of Sex&quot;. A film inspired by her life, &quot;The Danish Girl&quot;, was released in 2015. An opera based on her life, &quot;Lili Elbe&quot;, composed by Tobias Picker, premiered in 2023.

== Early life ==
It is generally believed that Elbe was born in 1882, in Vejle, Denmark, the child of Ane Marie Thomsen and spice merchant Mogens Wilhelm Wegener, according to the registry at St. Nicolai Church. Her birth year is sometimes cited as 1886 by a book about her in which some facts have been changed to protect the identities of the persons involved. Facts about her wife Gerda Gottlieb&#x27;s life suggest that the 1882 date is correct because they married while at college in 1904, when Elbe would have been just eighteen if the 1886 date were correct.

It is speculated that Elbe was intersex, although that has been disputed. Some reports indicate that she already had rudimentary ovaries in her abdomen and may have had Klinefelter syndrome.

== Marriage and modelling ==

Elbe met Gerda Gottlieb while they were students at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, and they married in 1904 when Gottlieb was nineteen and Elbe twenty-two. Gerda came from a conservative family, as her father was a vicar in the Lutheran church. They worked as illustrators, with Elbe specialising in landscape paintings while Gottlieb illustrated books and fashion magazines.

They travelled throughout Italy and France before settling in Paris in 1912, where Elbe could live more openly as a woman by posing as Gottlieb&#x27;s sister-in-law. Elbe received the in 1907 and exhibited at Kunstnernes Efterårsudstilling (the Artists&#x27; Fall Exhibition) at the Vejle Art Museum in Denmark, where she remains represented, and in the Saloon and Salon d&#x27;Automne in Paris.

Elbe started dressing in women&#x27;s clothes after she found she enjoyed the stockings and heels she wore to fill in for Gottlieb&#x27;s model, actress , who, on one occasion, had been late for a sitting. Larssen suggested the name &quot;Lili,&quot; and, by the 1920s, Elbe regularly presented with that name as a woman, attending various festivities and entertaining guests in her house. Gottlieb became famous for her paintings of beautiful women with haunting, almond-shaped eyes, dressed in chic apparel. The model for these depictions of &quot;petites femmes fatales&quot; was Elbe. Elbe stopped painting after her transition.

== Surgeries and dissolution of marriage ==
In 1930, Elbe went to Germany for sex reassignment surgery, which was highly experimental at the time. She contemplated suicide before learning of these options. While in Germany, Elbe stayed in the Hirschfeld Institute for Sexual Science. Prior to commencing any surgical procedures, Elbe&#x27;s psychological health was evaluated by German sexologist, Magnus Hirschfeld, through a series of tests. A series of four operations were then carried out over a period of two years. The first surgery, performed in Berlin, was the removal of the testicles, carried out by Erwin Gohrbandt. The remainder of her surgeries were carried out by Kurt Warnekros, a doctor at the Dresden Municipal Women&#x27;s Clinic. All of Lili Elbe&#x27;s medical documents were ruined as a consequence of the Allied bombing raids that destroyed the clinic and its archives. The second operation was to implant an ovary onto her abdominal musculature and the third to remove the penis and the scrotum. By this time, her case had become a sensation in Danish and German newspapers. A Danish court annulled the couple&#x27;s marriage in October 1930, and Elbe was able to have her sex and name legally changed, even receiving a passport as &quot;Lili Ilse Elvenes&quot;. The name &quot;Lili Elbe&quot; was first used in print in a Danish newspaper article written by Copenhagen journalist Louise &quot;Loulou&quot; Lassen for &quot;Politiken&quot; in February 1931. Elbe returned to Dresden and began a relationship with French art dealer Claude Lejeune, whom she wanted to marry and with whom she wished to have children. Gerda went on to marry an Italian man after separating from Elbe, although the marriage ended in divorce shortly after.

In 1931, Elbe returned for her fourth surgery, to transplant a uterus and construct a vaginal canal. This made her one of the earliest transgender women to undergo a vaginoplasty surgery, a few weeks after Erwin Gohrbandt performed the experimental procedure on Dora Richter.

== Death ==
Following Elbe&#x27;s fourth surgery, her immune system rejected the transplanted uterus, leading to organ rejection due to tissue incompatibility of the allografted uterus from the female donor, and ultimately a decrease in immunity. This ultimately caused an infection, which led to her death from cardiac arrest on 13 September 1931 in Dresden, Germany, three months after the surgery.

Elbe was buried in in Dresden, Germany, but the grave was leveled in the 1960s. In April 2016, a new tombstone was erected, financed by Focus Features, the production company that produced &quot;The Danish Girl&quot;. The tombstone does not indicate the date of Elbe&#x27;s birth, just her name and places of birth and death.

== Paintings ==
Apart from being one of the earliest recipients of gender-affirming surgery, Elbe was also a painter, but quit once she transitioned. The majority of Elbe&#x27;s painting focused on landscapes. She had many successful paintings, including &quot;Portrait de femme&quot; (1923)&quot;, Parti Fra Capri&quot; (1921), &quot;View from the Garden of Versailles&quot; (1922), &quot;Costal View from France&quot; (1918), and &quot;Trianon&quot; (1920)&quot;,&quot; to name a few&quot;.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
The LGBTQ+ film festival MIX Copenhagen gives out four Lili Awards each year, named after Elbe.

In 2000, David Ebershoff wrote &quot;The Danish Girl&quot;, a fictionalized account of Elbe&#x27;s life. It was an international bestseller and translated into many languages. This novel provided one of the earliest fictional accounts of gender affirmation surgery, which shaped LGBTQ+ literature. In 2015, it was made into a film of the same name, produced by Gail Mutrux and Neil LaBute, starring Eddie Redmayne as Elbe. The film was well received at the Venice Film Festival in September 2015, though it has been criticised for casting a cisgender man to play a transgender woman. Both the novel and film omitted several topics, including Gottlieb&#x27;s sexuality, which is evidenced by the subjects in her erotic drawings, and the disintegration of Gottlieb and Elbe&#x27;s relationship after their annulment.

Tobias Picker&#x27;s Lili Elbe, featuring Lucia Lucas, premiered at Theater St. Gallen, Switzerland. Based on the life of Lili Elbe and the book &quot;Man into Woman: An Authentic Record of a Change of Sex&quot;, the opera premiered on 22 October 2023, and received &quot;Best World Premiere&quot; in the 2023 Oper! Awards.

== Publications ==
In 1931, Lili Elbe was living in Denmark collaborating with her friend, Ernst Harthern, on a memoir of her life. was published by her German friend and editor under the name of Neils Hoyer following Elbe&#x27;s death. The narrative provided details of her life as Danish painter and her gender confirmation surgery. The possibility of Lili Elbe being intersex has been proposed due her reported possession of both male and female reproductive organs and the loss of medical records documenting her pre-surgical anatomy due to the Allied Bombing Raids. However, this theory has been disputed. The narrative was published four times, in three different languages over the course of two years. The UK and US versions, &quot;Man into Woman: An Authentic Record of a Change of Sex&quot; were both published in 1933.

&quot;Man into Woman: An authentic Record of a Change of Sex&quot; brought attention to new medical interventions as the story of Lili Elbe was circulated through American publications. American publications, such as &quot;A Man Becomes a Woman” and “When Science Changed a Man into a Woman”, published in the popular magazine, &quot;Sexology,&quot; associated the story of Lili Elbe with cases of intersex sex changes. These narratives promoted a binary view of gender, reinforcing gender stereotypes among Americans.

Lili Elbe and her memoir became well known in European media, publicized by Paul Weber. The story encouraged political action and brought awareness to the challenges faced by gender non-conforming people.

<doc id="277279" wikidata="Q4864521" url="?curid=277279" title="Barry Minkow">
<text>Barry Jay Minkow (born March 22, 1966) is a former American businessman, pastor, and convicted felon. While still in high school, Minkow founded ZZZZ Best (), which appeared to be an immensely successful carpet-cleaning and restoration company. However, it was actually a front to attract investment for a massive Ponzi scheme. ZZZZ Best collapsed in 1987, costing investors and lenders $100 million in one of the largest investment frauds ever perpetrated by a single person, as well as one of the largest accounting frauds in history. The scheme is often used as a case study of accounting fraud.

After being released from jail, Minkow became a pastor and fraud investigator in San Diego, and spoke at churches and schools about ethics. This came to an end in 2011, when he admitted to helping deliberately drive down the stock price of homebuilder Lennar and was ordered back to prison for five years. Three years later, Minkow admitted to defrauding his own church and was sentenced to an additional five years in prison. He is subject to restitution requirements totaling $612 million.

==Beginnings of ZZZZ Best==
Barry Minkow was born in Inglewood, California and was raised in the Reseda area of the San Fernando Valley in a Jewish family. When he was nine years old, his mother got him a job as a telemarketer with the carpet-cleaning business where she worked. At the age of 16, while a sophomore at Cleveland High School, Minkow started ZZZZ Best () in his parents&#x27; garage with three employees and four phones. In the early days, he had to rely on friends to drive him to carpet-cleaning jobs since he did not have a driver&#x27;s license.

At first, Minkow struggled to meet basic expenses. Two banks closed his business account because California law of the time did not allow minors to sign binding contracts, including checks. He was also plagued by customer complaints and demands for payment from suppliers. At times, he found it difficult even to make payroll. Faced with a shortage of operating capital, Minkow financed his business via check kiting, stealing and selling his grandmother&#x27;s jewelry, staging break-ins at his offices, and running up fraudulent credit card charges.

Soon after, Minkow branched into the &quot;insurance restoration&quot; business. With the help of Tom Padgett, a claims adjuster, Minkow forged numerous documents claiming that ZZZZ Best was involved in several restoration projects for Padgett&#x27;s company. Padgett and Minkow formed a fake company, Interstate Appraisal Services, that verified the details of these restorations to Minkow&#x27;s bankers. Flush with loans from these banks, Minkow expanded ZZZZ Best across Southern California.

While most Ponzi schemes are based on non-existent businesses, ZZZZ Best&#x27;s carpet-cleaning division was very real and won high marks for its quality. However, its insurance restoration division, which eventually accounted for 86% of company revenues, was fraudulent. Minkow raised money by factoring his accounts receivable for work under contract, as well as floating funds through several banks in an elaborate check kiting scheme.

After graduating from high school in 1985, Minkow devoted all of his time to ZZZZ Best. Short of cash despite the recent expansion, he got a loan from Jack Catain, a Los Angeles businessman who had ties to organized crime. Catain later sued Minkow for not paying him his share of the company&#x27;s profits, but Minkow claimed Catain was a usurer. The suit was still working its way through the courts at the time of Catain&#x27;s death in 1987. Other organized crime figures turned up as Minkow&#x27;s advisers, which unnerved his employees. For instance, a major shareholder, Maurice Rind, had been convicted of securities fraud in 1976. Minkow was also a business partner with Robert Viggiano, a convicted jewel thief and reputed loanshark.

==Going public==
At the suggestion of a friend, Minkow took his company public in January 1986, garnering a spot on NASDAQ. The accountant who audited ZZZZ Best before it went public did not visit the insurance restoration sites himself. Had he done so, he would have discovered they were mailboxes located throughout the San Fernando Valley. Minkow retained a fifty-three percent controlling interest in ZZZZ Best, making him an instant millionaire on paper. Going public seemingly offered him a way to cover up his fraudulent activities. Under securities law at the time, he had to retain his personal shares for two years. He planned to sell a million shares to the public in January 1988, believing this would give him enough money to pay everyone off and go completely legitimate.

In order to obtain more financing, Minkow was persuaded to raise $15 million of capital through an initial public offering of ZZZZ Best stock. When accountants wanted to inspect the company&#x27;s operations, he borrowed fake offices for a tour of &quot;Interstate Appraisal Services&quot; and used an incomplete building to present a fake restoration job. Mark Morze, ZZZZ Best&#x27;s financial consultant, tricked the accountants sent to perform the necessary due diligence by faking thousands of documents. The public offering closed in December and Minkow became the youngest person to lead a company through an IPO in American financial history.

Minkow launched a massive television advertising campaign portraying ZZZZ Best as a carpet cleaner that Southern Californians could trust. He owned a Ferrari and a BMW, and bought a mansion in the wealthy Valley community of Woodland Hills. He had ambitions of making the company &quot;the General Motors of the carpet-cleaning industry.&quot;

ZZZZ Best&#x27;s chief financial officer, Charles Arrington, was accused of running up $91,000 in fraudulent charges against customers of his florist business. When the Feshbach brothers, a pair of short-sellers, learned that Minkow still stood behind Arrington, they did further investigating and discovered ZZZZ Best&#x27;s claimed $7 million contract to clean carpets in Sacramento was likely a fraud. This prompted the Feshbachs to short ZZZZ Best&#x27;s stock, anticipating that it would fall. Additionally, none of the company&#x27;s four outside directors had any experience running a public company.

==Downfall==
By February 1987, ZZZZ Best was trading at $18 a share on NASDAQ, valuing the company at $280 million. Minkow&#x27;s stake was worth $100 million. The company now had 1,030 employees with offices in California, Arizona and Nevada.

Despite its growth, the company was still facing severe cash flow shortages from paying investors for the non-existent restoration projects. Minkow believed he&#x27;d found a solution when he learned that KeyServ, the authorized carpet cleaner for Sears, was being sold by its British parent. He began merger talks with KeyServ, as the cash infusion would solve ZZZZ Best&#x27;s immediate cash flow issues. Additionally, Minkow thought that KeyServ&#x27;s Sears business would give ZZZZ Best enough cash to end the Ponzi scheme sooner than originally planned. Drexel Burnham Lambert offered to finance the deal with a private placement of junk bonds.

Although KeyServ was twice ZZZZ Best&#x27;s size, the two companies agreed to a $25 million deal in which ZZZZ Best would be the surviving company. The merger would have made ZZZZ Best Sears&#x27; authorized carpet cleaner, and also would have made Minkow the president and chairman of the board of the largest independent carpet-cleaning company in the U.S. Soon after the KeyServ deal was announced, Minkow began making plans to become even more powerful, planning to raise $700–800 million to buy ServiceMaster in a hostile takeover and intending to expand to the United Kingdom. Outside of carpet cleaning, he had begun preliminary discussions to buy Major League Baseball&#x27;s Seattle Mariners.

Just as the KeyServ merger was about to close, the credit card fraud that helped keep ZZZZ Best afloat in the early years proved to be Minkow&#x27;s undoing. Minkow had blamed the fraudulent charges on unscrupulous contractors and another employee, and paid back most of the victims. However, he had not paid back a homemaker who had been overcharged a few hundred dollars. When he ignored her requests to pay her back, she tracked down several other people who had been defrauded by Minkow and gave a diary of her findings to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; then wrote a story revealing that Minkow had run up $72,000 in fraudulent credit card charges in 1984 and 1985. The story, which ran just days before the merger was to close, sent ZZZZ Best stock plunging 28 percent.

Within hours of the story&#x27;s publication, ZZZZ Best&#x27;s banks either called their loans or threatened to do so. Drexel postponed closing until it could investigate further. Later that day, at a press conference, a reporter revealed evidence that the Sacramento carpet-cleaning project didn&#x27;t exist. More seriously, she&#x27;d discovered that ZZZZ Best did not have the contractor&#x27;s license required for large-scale restoration work. To calm nervous investors, Minkow issued a press release touting record profits and revenues but did so without notifying Ernst &amp; Whinney (now part of Ernst &amp; Young), the firm responsible for auditing the company prior to the KeyServ deal. The press release also implied that Drexel had cleared ZZZZ Best of any wrongdoing, briefly stopping the decline. However, Drexel abruptly pulled out of the deal a few days later, causing the stock price to fall again. Drexel&#x27;s withdrawal stopped the deal four to seven days before it was due to close.

The day after this press release, Ernst &amp; Whinney discovered that Minkow had written several checks to support the validity of the non-existent contracts. Many of them had been written to an associate who later told Ernst &amp; Whinney officials about the fraud. Minkow denied knowing the man, but shortly after the checks were discovered, Ernst &amp; Whinney discovered that he had cut two checks to the associate for an unrelated matter. When Minkow could not explain the checks, Ernst &amp; Whinney resigned as ZZZZ Best&#x27;s auditor. However, it did not inform the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of its suspicions until a month later.

On July 2, Minkow abruptly resigned from ZZZZ Best for &quot;health reasons.&quot; By this time, his company&#x27;s stock had fallen to $3.50 a share—an 81 percent drop from its high in February. Minkow later revealed that on June 27, six days earlier, an independent law firm the company had retained to investigate the allegations asked for the addresses for all of the company&#x27;s restoration jobs. Minkow knew that those projects did not exist and decided to resign. Later, he reportedly told a member of his board that the insurance restoration business had been a sham from the very beginning.

ZZZZ Best&#x27;s new board conducted an internal investigation that largely substantiated the fraud allegations. On July 6 it sued Minkow, alleging that he had absconded with $23 million in company funds. ZZZZ Best claimed that its assets had been drained to the point that it was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Two days later, the Los Angeles Police Department raided ZZZZ Best&#x27;s headquarters and Minkow&#x27;s home, and found evidence that the company was being used to launder drug profits for organized crime.

==Conviction and prison==
Minkow and ten other ZZZZ Best insiders were indicted by a federal grand jury in January 1988 on fifty-four counts of racketeering, securities fraud, money laundering, embezzlement, mail fraud, tax evasion and bank fraud. The indictment accused Minkow of milking banks and investors of millions of dollars while systematically draining his company of assets. It also accused Minkow of setting up dummy companies, writing phony invoices and conducting tours of purported restoration sites. Prosecutors estimated that as much as ninety percent of the company&#x27;s revenue was fraudulent. On June 16, prosecutors won a superseding indictment charging Minkow with credit card fraud and two additional counts of mail fraud.

While Minkow admitted to manipulating the company&#x27;s stock, he claimed that he was forced to turn the company into a Ponzi scheme under pressure from the organized-crime figures who secretly controlled his company, a story he later admitted was false. On December 14, he was found guilty on all charges. On March 27, 1989, he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. He was also placed on five years&#x27; probation and ordered to pay $26 million in restitution. In sentencing him, U.S. District Court Judge Dickran Tevrizian described Minkow as a man without a conscience, rejecting his plea for a lighter sentence as &quot;a joke&quot; and &quot;a slap on the wrist&quot; for someone who had manipulated the financial system. The SEC subsequently banned him from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company again. He served under seven and a half years, most of them at Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood.

While imprisoned, Minkow claimed to have become a born-again Christian. During his prison stay, he became involved in Christian ministry, completing coursework through Liberty University&#x27;s School of Lifelong Learning.

==Release==
After his early release from prison in 1995, Minkow went to work as a pastor at the Church at Rocky Peak in Chatsworth, California, and became director of the church&#x27;s Bible Institute. That same year he wrote a first-hand account of the ZZZZ Best scam, &quot;Clean Sweep.&quot; All of the book&#x27;s proceeds went toward repaying his victims. His other substantial debt is a $7 million loan from Union Bank.

In 1997, Minkow became pastor of Community Bible Church in San Diego. Soon after his arrival, a church member asked him to look into a money management firm in nearby Orange County. Suspecting something was amiss, Minkow alerted federal authorities, who discovered the firm was a $300 million pyramid scheme. This was the beginning of the Fraud Discovery Institute (FDI), Minkow&#x27;s for-profit investigative firm. His original targets were penny stock companies, which are often havens for fraud. However, he soon attracted the attention of media outlets including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Bloomberg News, Fox News, and CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Several Wall Street investors sent money to Minkow in order to persuade him to pursue bigger targets. Minkow claimed to have uncovered $1 billion worth of fraud through the FDI.

==Shorting stock==
Minkow&#x27;s motives were brought into question by multiple news stories, which concluded that Minkow was shorting stock before he released a report on a public company. According to &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune,&quot; Minkow had engaged in this practice as early as 2006. His critics denounced this practice as unethical, if not illegal. At least one critic accused him of engaging in short and distort, a form of securities fraud which is a reversal of a pump and dump scheme.

For instance, Minkow accused Herbalife of a &quot;laundry list&quot; of issues and had &quot;correctly revealed that Herbalife&#x27;s president had inflated his résumé.&quot; Herbalife paid Minkow $300,000, after which he issued a press release withdrawing all accusations and contentions against the company, and removed all the accusations from his website. Additionally, Minkow made $50,000 from shorting Herbalife stock. He continued to profit from his short sales position due to sharp decreases in the reported company&#x27;s stock price immediately after releasing a new report.

On 20 February 2007, Minkow distributed a 500-page report to officials at the SEC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), accusing USANA of operating an illegal pyramid scheme. On the day Minkow&#x27;s report was released, USANA&#x27;s shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35. Minkow later acknowledged that he was shorting USANA&#x27;s shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.

USANA filed lawsuits against Minkow, accusing him of stock manipulation and defamation. However, USANA dropped the defamation suit and a judge later threw out four of the five claims brought against Minkow, ruling that the claims violated California&#x27;s anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism. The judge also cited two examples where USANA failed to refute Minkow&#x27;s claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands. The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when USANA and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all USANA-related materials from the FDI website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in USANA&#x27;s stock again. Separately from the settlement, USANA paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and the FDI under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that USANA never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.

Minkow almost always held a position in securities on which he reported. However, he has since stated that while his lawyers advised him this practice was legal, it was probably unethical. Several companies have since sued Minkow for making false accusations against them, with most of the suits being settled out of court.

==Lennar==
In 2009, Minkow issued a report accusing major homebuilder Lennar of massive fraud, claiming that irregularities in the company&#x27;s off-balance-sheet debt accounting were evidence of a massive Ponzi scheme. Minkow accused Lennar of not disclosing enough information about this to its shareholders, and also claimed a Lennar executive had taken out a fraudulent personal loan. In an accompanying YouTube video, he denounced Lennar as &quot;a financial crime in progress&quot; and &quot;a corporate bully.&quot; Lennar&#x27;s stock plummeted in the wake of Minkow&#x27;s reports, tumbling from $11.57 a share to $6.55 in two weeks. Minkow issued the report after being contacted by Nicholas Marsch, a San Diego developer who had filed two lawsuits against Lennar for fraud. Indeed, the language of the FDI report echoed that used in Marsch&#x27;s filings. One of Marsch&#x27;s suits was summarily thrown out; the other ended with Marsch having to pay Lennar $12 million in counterclaims.

Lennar responded by adding Minkow as a defendant in a lawsuit against Marsch. Minkow was initially unconcerned, since he had prevailed before in similar cases on free speech grounds. According to court records, Minkow had shorted Lennar stock, buying $20,000 worth of options in a bet that the stock would fall. Even more seriously, he also &quot;bought&quot; Lennar stock after his FDI report, believing the stock would rebound after its dramatic plunge. Minkow initially denied doing this, only to be forced to recant when confronted with trading records. Minkow forged documents alleging misconduct on Lennar&#x27;s part and lied about having to go to the emergency room on the night before he was first scheduled to testify. He also went forward with the report even after a private investigator he had hired for the case could not substantiate Marsch&#x27;s claims. In an unrelated development, it was also revealed that Minkow operated the FDI out of the offices of his church and even used church money to fund the organization—something which could have jeopardized his church&#x27;s tax-exempt status.

On December 27, 2010, Florida Circuit Court Judge Gill Freeman issued a default judgment against Minkow in response to a motion by Lennar. Freeman found that Minkow had repeatedly lied under oath, destroyed or withheld evidence, concealed witnesses, deliberately tried to &quot;cover up his misconduct&quot;, and had even lied to his own lawyers about his behavior. Freeman determined that Minkow had perpetrated &quot;a fraud on the court&quot; that was so egregious that letting the case go any further would be a disservice to justice. In her view, &quot;no remedy short of default&quot; was appropriate for Minkow&#x27;s lies. She ordered Minkow to reimburse Lennar for the legal expenses it incurred while ferreting out his lies. According to legal experts, terminating sanctions such as default judgments are extremely rare, since they are reserved for particularly egregious misconduct and have the effect of revoking a litigant&#x27;s right to defend himself. Earlier, Freeman had been so angered by Minkow&#x27;s behavior that she called him a liar in open court, a rarity for a judge. Lennar estimated that its attorneys and investigators spent hundreds of millions of dollars exposing Minkow&#x27;s lies.

==Insider trading guilty plea==
On March 16, 2011, Minkow announced through his attorney that he was pleading guilty to one count of insider trading. According to his lawyer, Minkow had bought his Lennar options using &quot;nonpublic information.&quot; The plea, which was separate from the civil suit, came a month after Minkow learned he was the subject of a criminal investigation. On the same day, Minkow resigned as senior pastor of Community Bible Church, saying in a letter to his congregants that since he was no longer &quot;above reproach,&quot; he felt that he was &quot;no longer qualified to be a pastor.&quot; Six weeks earlier, $50,000 in cash and checks had been stolen from the church during a burglary. Though unsolved, it was noted as suspicious due to Minkow&#x27;s admitted history of staging burglaries to collect insurance money.

The nature of the &quot;nonpublic information&quot; became clear a week later, when federal prosecutors in Miami filed a criminal information charging Minkow with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Prosecutors charged that Minkow and Marsch (listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the complaint) conspired to extort money from Lennar by driving down its stock. The complaint also revealed that Minkow had sent his allegations to the SEC, the FBI, and the IRS, and that the three agencies found his claims credible enough to open a formal criminal investigation into Lennar&#x27;s practices. Minkow then used confidential knowledge of that investigation to short Lennar stock, even though he knew he was barred from doing so. Minkow opted to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge rather than face charges of securities fraud and market manipulation, which could have sent him to prison for life.

On March 30, 2011, Minkow pleaded guilty before Judge Patricia A. Seitz. His attorney, Alvin Entin, admitted that his client had acted recklessly, but had been &quot;deluded and taken advantage of&quot; by Marsch. He faced a maximum of five years in prison, as much as $350,000 in fines and penalties and $500 million in restitution. However, he agreed to cooperate with the government in its probe of Marsch.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; obtained a copy of the plea agreement, in which Minkow admitted to issuing his FDI report on Lennar at Marsch&#x27;s behest. According to the agreement, Marsch offered to have Minkow retract his report if Lennar paid him in cash and stock. It also said that Minkow&#x27;s report triggered a bear raid which temporarily reduced the market capitalization of Lennar by $583 million. Minkow faced a minimum of thirty years in prison had the case gone to trial. On June 16, Freeman ordered Minkow to pay Lennar $584 million in damages—roughly the amount the company lost as a result of the bear raid orchestrated by Minkow and Marsch. Her ruling stated that Minkow and Marsch had entered into a conspiracy to wreck Lennar&#x27;s stock in November 2008. With interest, the bill could easily approach a billion dollars—far more than Minkow stole in the ZZZZ Best scam.

On July 6, it emerged that officials with Community Bible Church had accused Minkow of running the FDI with church funds, applying for credit cards in the names of church members and leading his flock into bad investments. Church officials had made the claims as part of a confidential pre-sentencing report. When Entin got word of the letter, he asked for and was granted two weeks to review the allegations and respond to them. This pushed Minkow&#x27;s sentencing back to July 21. This was the second time Minkow&#x27;s sentencing had been postponed; it was originally slated for June 16 but was postponed to July 6.

In a pre-sentencing evaluation performed on May 10, 2011, Minkow was diagnosed by a Michael Brannon as having a personality disorder with antisocial and narcissistic features, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, opioid dependence, anabolic steroid abuse, and migraine headaches.

On July 21, Seitz sentenced Minkow to five years in prison. In imposing the sentence, she stated that Minkow had &quot;no moral compass that says &#x27;Stop.&#x27;&quot; Seitz also ordered him to pay Lennar $583.5 million in restitution—an amount that had been imposed a month earlier in the civil case. She also recommended that Minkow serve his sentence at Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery in Montgomery, Alabama. However, on September 20, he was ordered to begin his sentence at Federal Medical Center, Lexington in Lexington, Kentucky.

==Church fraud guilty plea==
On June 14, 2011; KGTV in San Diego interviewed several members of Minkow&#x27;s former church, who said Minkow swindled them. One woman said Minkow asked her for $300,000, purportedly to help finance a movie about his redemption story.

On January 22, 2014, Minkow pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud and to defraud the federal government. He admitted to embezzling over $3 million in donations to Community Bible Church from 2001 to 2011. He opened unauthorized bank accounts purportedly on the church&#x27;s behalf, forged signatures on church checks, diverted money from legitimate church accounts for his personal use, and charged unauthorized personal expenses on church credit cards. He also concealed $890,000 of income and $250,000 in taxes from the IRS. Among his victims were a widower who gave $75,000 to fund a supposed hospital in Sudan to honor his wife after she died of cancer, and a woman who gave Minkow $300,000 that would have otherwise gone to help raise her teenage granddaughter.

On April 28, 2014, Judge Michael Anello sentenced Minkow to five years in prison, the maximum possible sentence under his plea bargain. It is to be served after Minkow completes his sentence for securities fraud. While Minkow&#x27;s attorneys asked for a sentence of forty-one months, Anello felt obligated to impose the maximum for what he called a &quot;despicable, inexcusable crime.&quot; On June 2, Minkow reached an agreement with federal prosecutors that called for him to pay $3.4 million in restitution. This will potentially be a ruinous amount for Minkow, on top of the restitution he still owes Lennar, Union Bank and the ZZZZ Best victims. Earlier, he said that the $26 million restitution for the ZZZZ Best scam alone was large enough that he would be writing restitution checks to the victims for the rest of his life. As a result of his latest sentence, Minkow was released on June 6, 2019.

==Film adaptation and docuseries==
Prior to his 2011 conviction, production began on a film detailing Minkow&#x27;s life and redemption. The film, featuring Mark Hamill, Justin Baldoni, Talia Shire and Ving Rhames, was partially funded by donations Minkow solicited from his congregation. Minkow insisted on playing the middle-aged version of himself in the film. Following his arrest, the film&#x27;s release was cancelled and work began on a new ending. The film—retitled &quot;Con Man&quot; from the original title &quot;Minkow&quot;—was eventually released in March 2018.

In January 2022, a three-part Discovery+ docuseries, called &quot;King of the Con&quot;, was released. The series explored how Minkow could reinvent himself and get rich several different times. The miniseries was produced by The Content Group, with Pamela Deutsch serving as executive producer for Discovery+, and has Minkow himself recounting his past, his crimes and the process of reinventing himself.

<text>Immortals ( ), or Persian Immortals, was the name given by the Greek historian Herodotus to a 10,000-strong unit of elite heavy infantry in the Achaemenid army. They served in a dual capacity, operating as an imperial guard and contributing to the ranks of the standing army. The force mainly consisted of Persians, along with Medes and Elamites. Essential questions regarding the unit&#x27;s history and organization remain unanswered due to the lack of authoritative sources.

==Ancient Greek accounts==

=== Herodotus ===

Herodotus describes the Immortals as heavy infantry led by the Persian military commander Hydarnes the Younger; they provided the professional corps of the Achaemenid army and numbered exactly 10,000 men. He stated that the unit&#x27;s name stemmed from the fact that every dead, seriously wounded, or sick Immortal was immediately replaced with a new one, maintaining the corps as a cohesive entity with a constant strength.

=== Xenophon ===
Xenophon () describes the guard of Cyrus the Great as having bronze breastplates and helmets, while their horses wore chamfrons and peitrels of bronze together with shoulder pieces that also protected the rider&#x27;s thighs. Herodotus instead describes their armament as follows: wicker shields covered in leather, short spears, quivers, swords or large daggers, slings, and bows and arrows. They wore coats of scale armour. The spear counterbalances of the common soldiery were of silver; to differentiate commanding ranks, the officers&#x27; spear butt-spikes were of gold. The regiment was followed by a caravan of covered carriages, camels, and mules that transported their supplies, along with concubines and attendants to serve them; this supply train carried special food that was reserved only for their consumption.

The headdress worn by the Immortals is believed to have been a conical or rounded metal on top and scale or chains on the sides, resembling a ridge helmet or Phrygian cap; surviving Achaemenid coloured glazed bricks and carved reliefs represent the Immortals as wearing elaborate robes, hoop earrings, and gold jewellery, although these garments and accessories were most likely worn only for ceremonial occasions.

=== Comparison with Persian sources ===
The Persian denomination of the unit is uncertain. This elite force is only referred to as the &quot;Immortals&quot; in sources based on Herodotus. There is evidence from Persian sources of the existence of a permanent corps, which provided a backbone for the tribal levies (raised by satraps) who, together with increasing numbers of mercenaries, made up the bulk of the Achaemenid army. However these do not record the name of &quot;Immortals&quot;; it is suggested that Herodotus&#x27; informant confused the word () with (), but this theory has been criticized by German linguist Rüdiger Schmitt.

==History==
The Immortals played an important role in the Achaemenid conquest of Egypt under Cambyses II in 525 BCE, as well as in the Achaemenid conquest of Indus Valley (western Punjab and Sindh, now located in Pakistan) and European Scythia under Darius I in and 513 BCE, respectively. They also notably participated in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BCE during the Greco-Persian Wars and were amongst the Persian troops who occupied Greece in 479 BCE under Mardonius.

During the final decades of the Achaemenid Empire, the role expected of the Immortals&#x27; () was extended to include that of chief minister to the King of Kings. The provision of a bodyguard, in direct attendance of the monarch, had already been allocated to a select thousand-strong detachment of the unit.

==Legacy==
===Sasanian Empire===
The first recurrence of the word &quot;Immortals&quot; is in Roman historians&#x27; description of an elite cavalry unit in the army of the Sasanian Empire. Primary sources suggest that they numbered around 10,000 men in accordance with tradition, with the main formational difference being that they were heavy cavalry. However, recent scholarship has doubted the Roman description of the force, including their name, their size, and that they were modeled on the Achaemenid Immortals, although there may have been one or more of such distinct elite cavalry units during the Sasanian period. Their task was mainly to secure any breakthroughs and to enter battles at crucial stages.

===Byzantine Empire===
The designation &quot;Immortal&quot; to describe a military unit was used twice during the era of the Byzantine Empire: first as elite heavy cavalry under John I Tzimiskes () and then later under Nikephoritzes, the chief minister of Byzantine emperor Michael VII Doukas (), as the core of a new central field army following the disastrous Byzantine defeat at Manzikert to the Seljuk Turks in 1071.

===French Empire===

During the 19th-century Napoleonic Wars, many French soldiers referred to Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard as &quot;the Immortals&quot;.

===Imperial State of Iran===

Under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, the Imperial Iranian Army included an all-volunteer known as the Javidan Guard (, ), named after the ancient Persian royal guard. The Javidan Guard was based at the Lavizan Barracks in Tehran. By 1978, this elite force comprised a brigade of 4,000–5,000 men, including a battalion of Chieftain tanks. Following the 1979 Islamic revolution that ended the Imperial State of Iran and the Pahlavi dynasty, the &quot;Immortal Guard&quot; was disbanded.

=== Islamic Republic of Iran ===

The signature shield of the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s Immortals has been adopted in the insignia of the 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade and the 55th Airborne Brigade of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army.

==In popular culture==
Herodotus&#x27; account of two warrior elites—the hoplites of Sparta and the Immortals of Persia—facing each other in battle has inspired a set of fanciful depictions of the battle, especially with regard to the Immortals:

*In the 1962 film &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot;, the Immortals carry a spear and wicker shields like the actual Immortals. However, they are mostly dressed in black and other dark colors in contrast to historical depictions.
*Frank Miller&#x27;s 1998 comic book &quot;300&quot; and the 2006 feature film adapted from it present a heavily fictionalized version of the Immortals at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BCE. These Immortals wear Mengu-style metal masks, appear to be inhuman or disfigured, and carry a pair of swords closely resembling Japanese wakizashis.
*The Immortals also appears in the film &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; that is mainly a parody of the film &quot;300&quot;. 
*The History Channel&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Last Stand of the 300&quot; also features the Immortals as part of the reconstruction of the historic battle at Thermopylae in ancient Greece. In this version, the Persian tiara that the Immortals habitually wore is depicted as a full-face black cloth mask transparent enough to see through.
*The second season of the show &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot; featured the Persian Immortals in a simulated match-up against Celtic warriors. The Immortals were found to be victorious.
*In the video game &quot;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&quot;, the protagonist Sargon is part of an elite group called The Immortals, who in the game serve as soldiers in the Persian army as well as bodyguards to the royal family, including the titular prince.

<doc id="277284" wikidata="Q1210870" url="?curid=277284" title="The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)">
<text>The Adventures of Robin Hood is a British television series comprising 143 half-hour, black and white episodes broadcast weekly between 1955 and 1959 on ITV. It starred Richard Greene as the outlaw Robin Hood, and Alan Wheatley as his nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham. The show followed the legendary character Robin Hood and his band of merry men in Sherwood Forest and the surrounding vicinity. While some episodes dramatised the traditional Robin Hood tales, most were original dramas created by the show&#x27;s writers and producers.

The programme was produced by Sapphire Films Ltd for ITC Entertainment, filmed at Nettlefold Studios with some location work, and was the first of many pre-filmed shows commissioned by Lew Grade. In 1954, Grade was approached by American producer Hannah Weinstein to finance a series of 39 half-hour episodes, at a budget of £10,000 an episode, of a series she wished to make called &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. She had already signed Richard Greene to the project as Robin Hood and been given the backing of US distribution company, Official Films Inc, who were confident of selling it to the US market. Grade was so impressed by her proposal that he agreed immediately to back the series, hoping to make large profits by selling programmes to the lucrative American market. In the UK, the series premiered on ATV London, on Sunday 25 September 1955. ATV Midlands began the series on Friday 17 February 1956, with a staggered start across other regions from 1956 to 1961 as the ITV regional stations came on-air for the first time in the UK. The US premiere was on Monday 26 September 1955 by CBS. The series was shot on 35mm film to provide the best possible picture quality, and had fade-outs where US commercials were intended to slot in (the series was sponsored in the US by Johnson &amp; Johnson (baby products, Band-Aid) and Wildroot Cream-Oil.

In Australia, the show aired on TCN9 in Sydney NSW and HSV7 Melbourne Victoria, actually being the first drama series broadcast by this station and CBC in Canada, and on CBS in the US. In France, RTF1 aired the show from 1965 to 1969 and RTF2 from 1969 to 1972. In Italy, Rai 1 aired the show from 1959 to 1964 and Rai 2 from 1965 to 1967. In Malaysia, RTM aired the show from late 1974 to early 1978. In the Philippines, ABS-CBN aired the show from 1963 to 1967, RBS (now GMA Network) from 1967 to 1972. In Indonesia, TVRI aired the show during the 1970s. In Romania, TVR aired the show from 1966 to 1980. In Poland aired the show in the late 1960s/early 1970s, in a popular programme for young people (each episode of the weekly programme &quot;Ekran z bratkiem&quot; ended with the broadcast of one episode of the series).

The programme continues to air in the United Kingdom on the Talking Pictures TV channel, shown regularly on Saturday mornings and on Sunday afternoons.

Corbett and Wilfrid Brambell (&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;), Billie Whitelaw, Paul Eddington, Ronald Allen and Gordon Jackson. John Schlesinger appeared as an actor in three episodes as singing minstrels (Hale and Alan a Dale (series 2)). A number of well-known actresses appeared as Saxon or Norman ladies, including Greta Gynt and Brenda de Banzie.

A number of actors appeared in supporting roles in most episodes: in series 1 these included: Victor Woolf, Willoughby Gray, and John Longden, and for later series included: Paul Hansard, Morris Barry, Nigel Davenport, Kevin Stoney, Ronald Hines, and Max Faulkner, who also did stunt/double work. Frank Maher (later Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s stunt double) played many small non-speaking parts, and stuntman Terry Yorke, who doubled for Richard Greene, played many small roles throughout all four series. In Series 3, Paul Eddington played a different character in many episodes, before settling down to Will Scarlett.

==Plot and writing==

The series is set in the 12th century, during the reign of King Richard the Lionheart.

Robin, Earl of Locksley, a Saxon nobleman, returns from the Crusades to find a Norman lord living in his ancestral home, Locksley Hall. He is forced to go to the Sheriff of Nottingham, who represents the law, seeking to reclaim his land. But the Sheriff, another Norman, sides with the usurper. Robin is tricked into signing a document fatal to his claim, but when the plot to then murder him goes wrong Robin ends up as a hunted man. In the forest he meets a peasant (Alfie Bass), who is due to have his hands mutilated for killing his lord&#x27;s deer, but Robin rescues him. The hunter tells him of outlaws living free in the forest. When they meet the outlaws, Robin drops his title and asks to just be called Robin. As he is hooded, they call him Robin of the Hood.

He is thus forced into the life of an outlaw, dwelling in Sherwood Forest with a band of men who right the wrongs committed by the rich and powerful Normans against the poor and defenceless Saxons. He is given the name Robin Hood by the outlaw band&#x27;s original leader, Will Scatlock, who is fatally wounded in the second episode. Robin Hood&#x27;s enemy in the series is the Sheriff of Nottingham who, with his cohorts, adherents of the tyrant, Prince John, schemes to capture the outlaw by any means possible. Lady Marian Fitzwalter (Maid Marian), a young noblewoman and Robin Hood&#x27;s lover, keeps him informed of the Sheriff&#x27;s whereabouts and intentions. Episodes are punctuated with manly deeds of derring-do, tense escapes and pursuits, princely tournaments, the thundering hoof-beats of powerful steeds, the clattering of flashing swords, and the whizzing of fatally placed arrows.

In &quot;A Year and A Day&quot; (series 2), a refugee peasant explains that, under English law, a peasant who escapes serfdom and lives in a city for &quot;a year and a day&quot; is a free man, provided the man lives openly, not in hiding. When Robin Hood helps the peasant move about the city, the Sheriff invokes &quot;the law of hue-and-cry&quot;, explaining that any man within hearing must drop his chores and help apprehend the felon. In &quot;A Christmas Goose&quot; (series 3), a boy&#x27;s goose nips a lord&#x27;s horse so the lord is thrown. The lord condemns the goose to death—for his Christmas dinner. But Robin Hood counters that under English common law, an accused animal is entitled to a fair trial, the same as a human. While Robin Hood drags out the trial, Friar Tuck gets the cook drunk and switches geese. When the deception is revealed, the lord relents and pardons the goose. Two episodes, &quot;Brother Battle&quot; (#84) and &quot;To Be a Student&quot; (#90) emphasized the Catholic Church&#x27;s struggle to educate commoners, and even the children of the Saxon serfs, despite laws forbidding the practice and in the face of opposition from the Norman nobility.

The supporting characters are occasionally resourceful. In &quot;The Goldmaker&#x27;s Return&quot; (series 2), Robin Hood is away in France on a mission. Lady Marian, Little John and the other Merry Men carry the day without the star of the show ever showing his face. Most of the time, however, Robin is required to save the day single-handed, following the usual comment that &quot;sending many men would be noticed, only one man going in alone will be overlooked&quot;, etc. Despite the simplistic plotting required by the 26-minute format, the writing was both professional in its handling of situations, and pointed in its dialogue.

Anachronisms abounded: the lipsticked girl with modern hairdo in the &quot;Friar Tuck&quot; episode, for instance; wine cups for each occupant at a table in &quot;Checkmate&quot;, when that only became the practice hundreds of years later; the 20th century school implements in &quot;Brother Battle&quot;; the use of Guineas from the 1700s as coinage; written tavern signs when most people were illiterate; and a &quot;bard&quot; in &quot;The Challenge&quot; episode who sings a song to the late 17th-century tune of &quot;Lillibullero&quot; in 12th-century England. All this is typical of every series of historical fiction, but the show&#x27;s producers pointed with pride to their accuracy, courtesy of hired consultants.

There was an element of self-parody at times. For instance, in one episode, &quot;The Challenge&quot;, the plot finished halfway through the show, and the remainder became a comedy as the hapless Richard of the Lea and his wife worried whilst their larder and wine cellar were emptied, during a siege, by Robin, Little John, and Tuck eating and dancing all the day and night.

==Episodes==
A total of 143 episodes were filmed in four series.

==Production details==
=== Blacklisted writers ===
&quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was produced by Hannah Weinstein, who had left-wing political views. The series was explicitly created by Weinstein to enable the commissioning of scripts by blacklisted American writers. Among these were Ring Lardner Jr., Waldo Salt, Robert Lees, and Adrian Scott. Howard Koch, who was also blacklisted, served for a while as the series&#x27; script editor. The blacklisted writers were credited under pseudonyms, to avoid the attention of studio executives.

The sponsored prints of the first five episodes of series one, screened by CBS in the US on its first run, had no writer credits on their end title sequences; writers were only credited on sponsored prints from episode 6 onward, only later non-sponsored US re-run prints of series one have writer credits for these episodes, some of which differ from writer credits on UK prints. As an example, Lawrence McClellan is credited as writer of &quot;The Coming of Robin Hood&quot; on US prints, for the UK the pseudonym used is Eric Heath.

After the blacklist collapsed, Lardner said that the series&#x27; format allowed him &quot;plenty of opportunities to comment on issues and institutions in Eisenhower-era America&quot;; presumably &quot;A Tuck in Time&quot; was such an episode, in which a twin of Friar Tuck arrives boasting of his willingness to sell a weapon that could destroy the world. In addition to the redistributive themes of a hero who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, many episodes in the programme&#x27;s first two seasons included the threat that Robin and his band would be betrayed to the authorities by friends or loved ones, much as the blacklisted writers had been. For example, the third season story &quot;The Angry Village&quot; had paranoid villagers turn on each other when they think a traitor is in their midst. But the half-hour length episodes and broad-target market precluded any political criticism that went beyond the generalities of 19th century Robin Hood revival books.

===Filming===
Whilst interiors were filmed at Nettlefold Studios, location shooting for the series took place on the nearby Wisley Common, Wisley, Surrey, and at the adjoining Foxwarren Park estate, near Cobham, owned by Hannah Weinstein. Horses used for filming were also stabled at Foxwarren House, which had a projection room for viewing daily film rushes and completed films. In 1956 a replica castle exterior, complete with drawbridge, was built in the grounds of the estate for filming of &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; series (it features prominently in title sequence for the colour episodes). This was used predominantly for castle scenes in series 3 &amp; 4 of Robin Hood, it first appears as Chateau Marmont in &quot;The Bandit of Brittany&quot; during series 2, in place of the standing castle and village set on the backlot at Nettlefold studios used in series 1 &amp; most of series 2.

As well as this, establishing shots and short film sequences were also shot at various medieval buildings in the UK including: Allington Castle in Kent, this was used to establish Fitzwalter Castle, Marian&#x27;s home in the series, Painshill Park, near Cobham, Saltwood Castle in Hythe, and Pencoed Castle near Magor in Monmouthshire. Three Northumberland sites were used: Alnwick Castle, Lindisfarne Castle, and Warkworth Castle. Some of the other sites used through the series were Bodiam Castle in East Sussex, Leith Hill near Dorking, Framlingham Castle in Suffolk, Newark Priory near Ripley, Castle Mill in Dorking, and Newark Mill.

===Music===
Each episode in the first two series started with a country scene of faux everyday life in Olde England, during which an introductory poem in rhymed cadence was intoned in voice-over, to the tune of the English folksong &quot;Early One Morning&quot;, which derives from a much later period than that in which the series is set. Each poem was a humorous summary vignette of what could be expected in the episode. In the first-run CBS-sponsored screenings in the US, an actor portraying the Minstrel would use the same melody before the final fade to black before the end credits, letting viewers know that the sponsor &quot;now begs a word with you&quot;.

&quot;Sumer Is Icumen In&quot;, an English ballad actually sung in the 12th century, is featured throughout the series. At times it is heard as background music at parties. In &quot;The Betrothal&quot;, Sir Richard&#x27;s son plays it on his flute while his betrothed sings it. In the episode &quot;Carlotta&quot;, Little John sings it to his sweetheart. In &quot;The Path of True Love&quot;, Marian sings it to stall Sir Charles. In one of its most prominent uses, Robin forces a group of soldiers to sing it. It&#x27;s worth noting that this melody was whistled by Little John before his first meeting with Robin in the Hollywood feature film &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938).

The Merry Men perform the soul cake song in &quot;The Thorkil Ghost&quot;, with Derwent singing a solo.

&quot;All Around My Hat (song)&quot;, a song of nineteenth-century English origin, features very prominently in the plot of the episode &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. It is claimed to be a favourite song of the crusading King Richard and is continually sung by the king&#x27;s courier who has been secretly imprisoned in Prince John&#x27;s dungeon. The tune is so charismatic that a dungeon jailer sings it while drinking at a tavern and is overheard by Robin Hood, thus alerting Robin to the courier&#x27;s fate.

The episode &quot;The Haunted Mill&quot; features a song supposedly sung by the Baker&#x27;s guild.

The episode &quot;The Minstrel&quot; featured two songs, one wishing for the speedy return of King Richard, and one lampooning the sheriff of Nottingham.

====Closing theme song====
Carl Sigman wrote the words and music for the theme song, which was sung by Dick James. The song is still fondly remembered:

Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Riding through the glen
Robin Hood, Robin Hood, With his band of men
Feared by the bad, Loved by the good
Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood

He called the greatest archers to a tavern on the green
They vowed to help the people of the king
They handled all the trouble on the English country scene
And still found plenty of time to sing

[Chorus (1st paragraph) repeat]
In 1956 the theme song was released on Parlophone records by Dick James with Stephen James and his chums and Ron Goodwin&#x27;s Orchestra and reached number 14 in the UK charts (78rpm single:R.4117/45rpm single:MSP6199), and by Pye Records as a 78rpm single by Gary Miller with Tony Osbourne orchestra and the Beryl Stott chorus (PYE N.15020) and reached number 10 on the UK charts. Versions by Frankie Laine (CBS Coronet), Nelson Riddle and his Orchestra (Capitol), Alan Dale (Coral), Joe Reisman&#x27;s orchestra and chorus (RCA Victor), and Ronnie Ronalde (Colombia) were also issued. These versions had extended lyrics, with five verses and the chorus repeated six times. The sound effect at the start of the theme tune, of an arrow being fired into a tree, was produced by record producer Joe Meek, who was also the recording engineer on the Gary Miller version.

This song was parodied many years later on the 1970s TV series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, in their Dennis Moore sketch, which depicted a masked highwayman from the 18th century (intended to mimic in appearance the real life highwayman Dick Turpin) stealing lupins (parodied as &quot;... He steals from the poor, Gives to the rich, Stupid bitch!&quot;). It&#x27;s also played at every Nottingham Forest home match. The song, the titles, and the whole show were also parodied in the &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; television episode &quot;Ericson the Viking&quot; in 1958, where Sid James talks Hancock into appearing in an on-the-cheap historical drama, &quot;Ericson, Ericson, Ericson the Good: Ericson, Ericson, nipping through the wood...ole!&quot;

&quot;Robin des Bois&quot; was the theme recorded for the French TV market. Sung in French, it can be heard on the 3rd series episode &quot;Farewell to Tuck&quot; released by Network on DVD. The series was first broadcast in France as &quot;Aventures dans la Foret de Sherwood&quot; in 1965 on ORTF. Other countries to broadcast the series included Canada in 1955–1958 on CBOT, Toronto, and CKCO, Kitchener, Ontario; Australia in 1956–1961 on HSV7 (The Seven Network); Finland in 1964 on NORDEEZE; the Netherlands in 1965/66 on AVRO; and Germany between 1971 and 1974 on ARD.

First series episodes also exist with a variant downbeat instrumental end theme by Edwin Astley, which can be heard on the episode &quot;The Highlander&quot; released by Network DVD.

===Artistic details===
Art director Peter Proud, an expert at wartime camouflage, hit on the idea of putting many props on wheels to facilitate quick set changes, since one 26-minute episode was shot every four and a half days. The show boasted &quot;140 set pieces (baronial fireplaces, staircases, stone walls, entrance halls, and the like)&quot;. There was some outdoor location filming, mainly involving horse-riding doubles and stuntmen, and without dialogue recording. Sets were designed from parchments and sketches from the British Museum, and modelled on the castles of Harlech, Farleigh, and Framlingham. Some of the 100 soldiers who manned the battlements of Nottingham Castle were miniature toy soldiers.

===Sponsorship===

In the US the original CBS syndication prints had a few variants to the original UK prints. After the brief title sequence the US prints would repeat this sequence but with &quot;Brought to You By&quot; and after the arrow strikes the tree the sponsor&#x27;s name &quot;Wildroot Cream-Oil&quot; superimposed, &quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson&quot; sponsored episodes had a voice-over over the opening titles &quot;Richard Greene in The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and over the repeated sequence &quot;presented by&quot; followed by the names of two Johnson &amp; Johnson products, images of which would appear over the shot of the arrow in the tree. A commercial featuring one of the products would then be shown, the Wildroot Cream-Oil sponsored episodes would then feature an animated commercial showing a Robin Hood–type figure with lank hair and a dinosaur. A Minstrel song would then be sung at the beginning of each episode, over the episode title, providing a playful poetic synopsis in short prose of what could be expected to be seen. After the final fade to black a sequence featuring an actor playing the Minstrel would be shown as he sang these lyrics to the tune of &quot;Early One Morning&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ll have the merry time again with Robin and his Merry Men and the folk who&#x27;ll bring him to you then now beg a word with you&quot;, followed by a commercial for the next week&#x27;s sponsor before the end titles would be shown (Wildroot Cream Oil and Johnson &amp; Johnson sponsored alternate episodes), the end credits start with the opening sequence, with Sandy Becker mentioning the sponsor&#x27;s name again, and the sponsor&#x27;s product appearing on screen through the end titles which are shown over the shot of the tree. This caption also appeared: &quot;This film was flown to the USA via Pan American World Airways&quot;. The opening minstrel tunes were also sung to the tune of &#x27;Early One Morning&#x27;. There were two sponsors of the CBS syndicated screenings, Wildroot Cream-Oil (a hair tonic company), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (known in the UK and US for its baby powder). The commercials involved &quot;within&quot; the episodes appeared originally on all three Seasons broadcast at 7.30pm (eastern standard time) /6.30pm (central standard time) Monday nights on CBS (not series 4).

Alternative title captions appear over the opening sequence on some US prints. Instead of &quot;Richard Greene in The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; they state &quot;Richard Greene plays Robin Hood – Adventures in Sherwood Forest&quot;. This practice occurred because of an FCC rule demanding that reruns of a series be retitled for syndication packaging if aired while first-run episodes of the series were still being shown on one of the three major networks.

Alternative US end credit titles crediting the series as &quot;A Hannah Weinstein Production for Sapphire Films Limited&quot; (and for later episodes from 1958 &quot;A Hannah Fisher Production&quot;) also exist.

In the UK, at the time, sponsorship of programmes was not allowed and each episode had one commercial break in the middle.

==Influence==
The series was an immediate hit on both sides of the Atlantic, drawing 32,000,000 viewers per week. Sapphire films were commissioned to make four other series by Lew Grade: &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; (1956/57, broadcast by NBC on Monday nights at 8.00 pm), &quot;The Buccaneers&quot; (1956/57, broadcast by CBS on Saturday nights at 7.30 pm), &quot;Sword of Freedom&quot; (1957/58), and &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1958/59). The success of these inspired other historic drama series from ITC like &quot;The Adventures of William Tell&quot;, &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. ITC continued to make and sell TV series to the US until the late 1970s, including &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

==Merchandise==
===Products===
Many licensed products and knockoffs were sold, including books, jigsaw puzzles, iron-on patches, toy bows and arrows, a series of bubble gum cards, and more. The &quot;Robin Hood&quot; shoe brand sporting Richard Greene&#x27;s likeness on the interior heel lasted long after the series stopped production. Magazine Enterprises featured Richard Greene photos on three Robin Hood comic books. Robin and Marian made the cover of TV Guide in the Week of 12–18 May 1956.

==Compilation episodes==
In the early 1990s, in the wake of the Kevin Costner film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, three movie-length compilation features (approx. 90 min. each) were created from the series by producers Philip May &amp; Joseph Shields, through editing and computer-colourizing parts of the various episodes, though not necessarily in chronological order. These were as follows:
* &quot;Robin Hood: The Movie&quot; (1991), featuring edited material from episodes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 27. Notably, Will Scatlock who dies at the end of episode 2 in the series (thereby transferring the outlaw leadership to Robin Hood), is not killed until the end of the 90 min feature.
* &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Greatest Adventures&quot; (1991)
* &quot;Robin Hood: Quest for the Crown&quot; (1991)

==Film==
Sidney Cole and Richard Greene produced the feature film &quot;Sword of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1960), for Hammer Film Productions (in association with Yeoman Films), directed by Terence Fisher, written by Alan Hackney, director of photography was Ken Hodges, and the film editor was Lee Doig, all TV series alumni. Richard Greene starred as Robin Hood with Peter Cushing as the Sheriff of Nottingham; blonde-haired Sarah Branch played Maid Marian with Nigel Green as Little John, Jack Gwillim as Archbishop Hubert Walter, and Richard Pasco as Edward, Earl of Newark. Oliver Reed also had a small role. It was filmed in colour and in a widescreen process referred to as &quot;Megascope&quot; on the opening titles. The film itself was a retelling of how Robin first met Marion.

<doc id="277285" wikidata="Q1572828" url="?curid=277285" title="French frigate Méduse (1810)">
<text>Méduse was a 40-gun frigate of the French Navy, launched in 1810. She took part in the Napoleonic Wars during the late stages of the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811 and in raids in the Caribbean.

In 1816, following the Bourbon Restoration, &quot;Méduse&quot; was armed en flûte to ferry French officials to the port of Saint-Louis, in Senegal, to formally re-establish French occupation of the colony under the terms of the First Peace of Paris. Through inept navigation by her captain, Hugues Duroy de Chaumareys, who had been given command after the Bourbon Restoration for political reasons and even though he had hardly sailed in 20 years, &quot;Méduse&quot; struck the Bank of Arguin off the coast of present-day Mauritania and became a total loss.

Most of the 400 passengers on board evacuated, with 146 men and 1 woman forced to take refuge on an improvised raft towed by the frigate&#x27;s launches. The towing proved impractical, however, and the boats soon abandoned the raft and its passengers in the open ocean. Without any means of navigating to shore, the situation aboard the raft rapidly turned disastrous. Dozens were washed into the sea by a storm, while others, drunk from wine, rebelled and were killed by officers. When supplies ran low, several of the injured were thrown into the sea, and some of the survivors resorted to the Custom of the Sea, engaging in cannibalism. After 13 days at sea, the raft was discovered with only 15 people still alive.

News of the tragedy stirred considerable public emotion, making &quot;Méduse&quot; one of the most infamous shipwrecks of the Age of Sail. Two survivors, a surgeon and an officer, wrote a widely read book about the incident, and the episode was immortalised when Théodore Géricault painted &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;, which became a notable artwork of French Romanticism.

==Service==
&quot;Méduse&quot; was commissioned in Nantes on 26 September 1807.

===Napoleonic Wars===

In 1811, she was sent off to Java with , in a frigate division under the command of Joseph-François Raoul. On 2 September, the frigates arrived at Surabaya, tailed by the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Bucephalus&quot;. Two days later, another British ship, HMS &quot;Barracouta&quot;, joined the chase, but lost contact on 8 September. On 12 September, &quot;Méduse&quot; and &quot;Nymphe&quot; chased &quot;Bucephalus&quot;, which escaped and broke contact the next day. &quot;Méduse&quot; was back in Brest on 22 December 1811. She then continued her service in the Atlantic.

Between 27 and 29 December 1813, the French frigates and &quot;Méduse&quot; captured a number of British merchant ships at . The vessels captured were , &quot;Lady Caroline Barham&quot;, and &quot;Potsdam&quot;, all three coming from London and bound to Jamaica; &quot;Flora&quot;, from London to Martinique; &quot;Brazil Packet&quot;, from Madeira to ; and &quot;Rosario&quot; and &quot;Thetis&quot;, from Cape Verde. The French burnt all the vessels they captured, except &quot;Prince George&quot;. They put their prisoners into her and sent her off as a cartel to Barbados, which she reached on 10 January 1814.
===Bourbon Restoration===
With the restoration of the French monarchy in 1814, Louis XVIII decided to restore Royalist and nobility dominance of the senior ranks of both the French Navy and Army. Consequently, Hugues Viscount Duroy de Chaumareys was appointed &quot;Capitaine de frégate&quot; and given command of &quot;Méduse&quot;; de Chaumareys had previous experience, but had been effectively retired for nearly 20 years.

==Course to Senegal==
On 17 June 1816, a convoy under the command of Hugues Duroy de Chaumareys on &quot;Méduse&quot; departed Rochefort accompanied by the storeship &quot;Loire&quot;, the brig &quot;Argus&quot; and the corvette &quot;Écho&quot; to receive the British handover of the port of Saint-Louis in Senegal. &quot;Méduse&quot;, armed en flûte, carried many passengers, including the appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-Désiré Schmaltz, his wife Reine Schmaltz, and his secretary, Joseph Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Griffon du Bellay. &quot;Méduse&quot;″s complement totaled 400, including 160 crew plus a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to serve as the garrison of Saint-Louis. The ship reached the island of Madeira on 27 June.

Schmaltz then wanted to reach Saint-Louis as fast as possible, by the most direct route, although this would take the fleet dangerously close to the shore, where there were many sandbars and reefs. Experienced crews usually sailed further out. &quot;Méduse&quot; was the fastest of the convoy and, despite his orders to maintain the convoy, Captain Chaumareys quickly lost contact with &quot;Loire&quot; and &quot;Argus&quot;. &quot;Écho&quot; kept pace and attempted to guide &quot;Méduse&quot;, but to no avail; the smaller ship eventually gave up and moved further out.

Chaumareys further compounded his poor decisions by allowing an inexperienced passenger named Richefort to serve as navigator. Richefort was a philosopher and a member of the Philanthropic Society of Cape Verde; his appointment was a violation of naval service regulations. As &quot;Méduse&quot; neared the coast of Africa, Richefort apparently mistook a large cloud bank on the horizon for Cape Blanco on the African coast, and so underestimated the proximity of the Bank of Arguin off the coast of Mauritania.

On 2 July 1816, now more than off course, &quot;Méduse&quot; ran into increasingly shallow water, and neither the captain nor the navigator noticed dangerous signs such as the mud bottom starting to become visible. Eventually, First Lieutenant Maudet began taking soundings off the bow, and, measuring only , recognized the danger. Chaumareys ordered the ship brought up into the wind, but it was too late, and &quot;Méduse&quot; ran aground from the coast. The accident occurred at spring high tide, making it dangerous to re-float the ship without massive flooding. The captain failed to jettison the ship&#x27;s heavy 14 three-tonne cannons and so the ship soon lodged deep in the mud.

===Raft===

&quot;Méduse&quot; was not carrying enough lifeboats to transport all of the passengers to safety in a single trip. Instead, it was proposed that the ship&#x27;s launches should ferry the passengers and crew to shore, away, in two separate trips. Numerous ideas for lightening &quot;Méduse&quot; in an effort to lift her off the reef were also proposed, such as building a raft so cargo could be safely removed.

A raft measuring long and wide was soon constructed with salvaged wood planks and was nicknamed &quot;la Machine&quot; by the crew. On 5 July, a gale developed and &quot;Méduse&quot;″s battered hull began to break up. The passengers and crew panicked, and Chaumareys decided to evacuate the frigate immediately rather than enact the original plan to make two trips. The raft was hastily repurposed for moving passengers and the &quot;Méduse&quot;″s longboats were rigged to tow it behind them; this left 146 men and 1 woman on an improvised craft that struggled to hold their weight. The raft could carry few supplies, had no means of steering, no navigational tools, and took on water easily. Seventeen men, fearing disaster, chose to stay with the sinking &quot;Méduse&quot; and await rescue.

The crew in the launches soon found that pulling the raft slowed them down considerably and became worried that the passengers might overwhelm them. After travelling only a few kilometers, they cut the tow line and abandoned the raft&#x27;s occupants. The lifeboats, which carried the captain, Governor Schmaltz, and other high-ranking persons, were the first to reach the coast of Africa. Most of the boats&#x27; survivors made it to safety in French Senegal, though some died as they travelled overland.

On the raft, the situation deteriorated rapidly. Instead of water, only wine had been packed; drunken fights broke out between the officers and passengers on one hand, and the sailors and soldiers on the other. On the first night adrift, 20 men were killed or committed suicide. A storm then hit, and more survivors were either trampled to death in a panic or swept overboard to drown. Rations dwindled rapidly; by the fourth day there were only 67 people left alive on the raft, and some resorted to cannibalism (part of the Custom of the Sea) to survive. On the eighth day, the fittest decided to throw the weak and wounded overboard, leaving just 15 men remaining, all of whom survived another four days until their rescue on 17 July by the brig &quot;Argus&quot;, which accidentally encountered them.

==Aftermath==
&quot;Argus&quot; took the survivors of the raft to Saint-Louis to recover. Five of them, including Jean Charles, the last African crew member, died within days. Chaumareys decided to rescue the gold that was still on board &quot;Méduse&quot; and sent out a salvage crew, which discovered that &quot;Méduse&quot; was still largely intact. Only three of the 17 men who had decided to stay on &quot;Méduse&quot; were still alive 54 days later. British naval officers helped the survivors to return to France because aid from the French Minister of the Marine was not forthcoming.

&quot;Méduse&quot;″s surviving surgeon, Henri Savigny, and the governor&#x27;s secretary submitted their account of the tragedy to the authorities. It was leaked to an anti-Bourbon newspaper, the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;, and was published on 13 September 1816. The incident quickly became a scandal in French politics and Bourbon officials tried to cover it up. At his court-martial at Port de Rochefort in 1817, Chaumareys was tried on five counts but acquitted of abandoning his squadron, of failing to re-float his ship and of abandoning the raft; however, he was found guilty of incompetent and complacent navigation and of abandoning &quot;Méduse&quot; before all her passengers had been taken off. Even though this verdict exposed him to the death penalty, Chaumareys was sentenced to only three years in jail. The court-martial was widely thought to be a &quot;whitewash.&quot; The Gouvion de Saint-Cyr Law later ensured that promotions in the French military would thereafter be based on merit.

Savigny and another survivor, the geographer-engineer Alexandre Corréard, subsequently wrote a book with their own account (&quot;Naufrage de la frégate la Méduse&quot;) of the incident, published in 1817. It went through five editions by 1821 and was also published with success in English, German, Dutch, Italian, and Korean translations. A revision of the text in later editions increased the political thrust of the work.

===Shipwreck site===
In 1980, a French marine archaeological expedition led by Jean-Yves Blot located the &quot;Méduse&quot; shipwreck site off the coast of modern-day Mauritania. The primary search tool was a one-of-a-kind magnetometer developed by the CEA.

The search area was defined on the basis of the accounts of survivors of &quot;Méduse&quot; and, more importantly, on the records of an 1817 French coastal mapping expedition that found the vessel&#x27;s remains still projecting above the waves. The background research proved to be so good that the expedition team located the shipwreck site on the first day of searching. They then recovered enough artifacts to identify the wreck positively and to mount an exhibit in the Marine Museum in Paris.

==In popular culture==
===Géricault&#x27;s painting===

Impressed by accounts of the shipwreck, the 25-year-old artist Théodore Géricault decided to create an oil painting based on the incident and contacted the writers in 1818. His work depicts a moment recounted by one of the survivors: prior to their rescue, the passengers saw a ship on the horizon, which they tried to signal. She disappeared, and in the words of one of the surviving crew members, &quot;From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief&quot;. The ship &quot;Argus&quot; reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained. The painting, titled &quot;Le Radeau de la Méduse&quot; (English: &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;), is considered an iconic work of the French Romantic movement and Géricault&#x27;s masterpiece. It is on display in the Louvre.

* &quot;Wreck of the Medusa&quot; by Alexander McKee, a narrative account of the final voyage, shipwreck and aftermath originally published in 1976 under the title &quot;Death Raft&quot; and reprinted in 2007. McKee draws upon multiple sources and provides analysis of the event in relation to similar maritime and aeronautical disasters.
* The second volume of Peter Weiss&#x27;s novel &quot;Die Ästhetik des Widerstands&quot; (&quot;The Aesthetics of Resistance&quot;), originally published in 1978, opens with a detailed historical account of &quot;Méduse&quot; and subsequently describes Géricault&#x27;s painting
* In &quot;A History of the World in 10½ Chapters&quot; (1989) by Julian Barnes, a semi-fictional work that attempts to deglaze and satirise popular historical legends, the chapter &quot;Shipwreck&quot; is devoted to analysis of the Géricault painting, with the first half narrating the incidents leading to the shipwreck and the survival of the crew members. The second half of the chapter renders a dark platonic and satirical analysis of the painting itself, and Géricault&#x27;s &quot;softening&quot; the impact of crude reality in order to preserve the aestheticism of the work.

How fares the Raft of the Medusa?&quot; – clearly a black humor reference to the 1816 disaster, but also an ominous foreshadowing of his own expedition&#x27;s ultimately tragic fate, which would also be marred by incidents of cannibalism in the face of starvation among the crew in their final months.

<text>A spirit duplicator (also Rexograph and Ditto machine in North America, Banda machine and Fordigraph machine in the U.K. and Australia) is a printing method invented in 1923 by Wilhelm Ritzerfeld, which was used for most of the 20th century. The term &quot;spirit duplicator&quot; refers to the alcohols that were the principal solvents used in generating copies. 

Spirit duplicators were used mainly by schools, churches, clubs, and other small organizations, such as in the production of fanzines, because of the limited number of copies one could make from an original, along with the low cost (and corresponding low quality) of copying.

The spirit duplicator coexisted alongside the mimeograph and the hectograph, devices with a similar purpose but different operation.

== History ==

The spirit duplicator was invented in 1923 by Wilhelm Ritzerfeld. The best-known manufacturer in the United States and the world was Ditto Corporation of Illinois. Copiers in the United Kingdom were commonly manufactured by Associated Automation Ltd of Willesden, London NW10, a subsidiary company of the computer makers Elliott-Automation Ltd for the Block &amp; Anderson company, under their &quot;Banda&quot; brand. In both cases the trademark became a generic name for both the copiers and the process in their respective markets.

The faintly sweet aroma of pages fresh off the duplicator was a feature of school life in the spirit-duplicator era.

== Design ==

The duplicator uses two-ply &quot;spirit masters&quot;, also called &quot;master sheets&quot;. The first sheet can be typed, drawn, or written upon. The second sheet is coated with a layer of wax that had been impregnated with one of a variety of colorants. The pressure of writing or typing on the first sheet transfers the colored wax from the second sheet to the shiny, coated back side of the first sheet, producing a mirror image. This produces the same result as a sheet of carbon paper put in backwards. The two sheets are then separated, and the first sheet is fastened onto the drum of the machine, with the back side facing out, acting as a printing plate.

There is no separate ink used in spirit duplication, as the wax transferred to the back side of the first sheet contains the ink. As the paper to be printed moves through the printer, the solvent is spread across each sheet by an absorbent wick. When the solvent-impregnated paper comes into contact with the back side of the first sheet, it dissolves just enough of the pigmented wax to print the image onto the paper as it goes under the printing drum. One master can produce 40 or so good copies; after that, the copies gradually become paler as the colored wax is used up.

The usual wax color was aniline purple (mauve), a cheap, moderately durable pigment that provided good contrast, but masters were also manufactured in red, green, blue, and black, as well as the hard-to-find orange, yellow, and brown. All except black reproduced in pastel shades: pink, mint, sky blue, and so on.

Spirit duplicators had the useful ability to print multiple colors in a single pass, which made them popular with cartoonists. Multi-colored designs could be made by swapping out the waxed second sheets; for instance, shading in only the red portion of an illustration while the top sheet was positioned over a red-waxed second sheet. This was possible because the duplicating fluid was not ink, but a clear solvent.

The duplicating fluid typically consisted mostly of methanol or ethanol, both of which were inexpensive, readily available in quantity, evaporated quickly, and would not wrinkle the paper. Sometimes small amounts of other solvents such as “cellosolve“ were added to improve image quality. 

In 1938, a nonflammable solvent was invented by Johan Bjorksten to allow the possibility of using electrically driven machines without the concern of the flammability of pure methyl/ethyl alcohol. &quot;A composition composed of 10% of trichlorofluoromethane and 90% of a mixture of 50% methyl alcohol, 40% ethyl alcohol, 5% water and 5% of ethylene glycol mono-ethyl ether. This solvent mixture is non-flammable in the closed space of the reservoir and has a flash point of 100 °F when fully exposed to air. The solvent mixture has a pleasant odor, reduced toxicity and gives at least as good copies as the duplication liquid before the addition of the trichlorofluoromethane. It is believed that the high efficiency of trichlorofluoromethane as a flame reducing agent is due to the fact that its boiling point is sufficiently low as to cause the formation of a non-flammable vapor film on the surface of the organic solvent, with sufficiently high boiling point as to be substantially retained by the solvents even at high summer temperatures.&quot;

== Durability ==

Dittoed copies now pose a serious challenge to archivists responsible for historic document and artistic preservation. Dittoed images gradually fade with exposure to ultraviolet light, limiting their usability for permanent labels and signage. Fluorescent lighting emits small amounts of ultraviolet light. When exposed to direct sunlight ditto copies can fade to illegibility in less than a month. The low-quality paper often used would yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the untreated pulp. In the worst case, old copies can crumble into small particles when handled.

<doc id="277289" wikidata="Q43302" url="?curid=277289" title="Wind power">
<text>Wind power is the use of wind energy to generate useful work. Historically, wind power was used by sails, windmills and windpumps, but today it is mostly used to generate electricity. This article deals only with wind power for electricity generation.
Today, wind power is generated almost completely with wind turbines, generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid.

In 2022, wind supplied over 2,304 TWh of electricity, which was 7.8% of world electricity.
With about 100 GW added during 2021, mostly in China and the United States, global installed wind power capacity exceeded 800 GW. 32 countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity from wind power in 2023 and wind generation has nearly tripled since 2015. To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change, analysts say it should expand much faster – by over 1% of electricity generation per year.

Wind power is considered a sustainable, renewable energy source, and has a much smaller impact on the environment compared to burning fossil fuels. Wind power is variable, so it needs energy storage or other dispatchable generation energy sources to attain a reliable supply of electricity. Land-based (onshore) wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than most other power stations per energy produced. Wind farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors, although they are generally more expensive. Offshore wind power currently has a share of about 10% of new installations.

Wind power is one of the lowest-cost electricity sources per unit of energy produced. 
In many locations, new onshore wind farms are cheaper than new coal or gas plants.

Regions in the higher northern and southern latitudes have the highest potential for wind power. In most regions, wind power generation is higher in nighttime, and in winter when solar power output is low. For this reason, combinations of wind and solar power are suitable in many countries.

== Wind energy resources ==

Wind is air movement in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. In a unit of time, say 1 second, the volume of air that had passed an area formula_1 is formula_2. If the air density is formula_3, the flow rate of this volume of air is formula_4, and the power transfer, or energy transfer per second is formula_5. Wind power is thus &quot;proportional&quot; to the &quot;third power&quot; of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Change of wind speed by a factor of 2.1544 increases the wind power by one order of magnitude (multiply by 10).

The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1.50 MJ/m2 over the period from 1979 to 2010, 1.31 MJ/m2 in the Northern Hemisphere with 1.70 MJ/m2 in the Southern Hemisphere. The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine, absorbing heat at higher temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for the production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m2 thus sustaining the circulation of the atmosphere against friction.

Through wind resource assessment, it is possible to estimate wind power potential globally, by country or region, or for a specific site. The Global Wind Atlas provided by the Technical University of Denmark in partnership with the World Bank provides a global assessment of wind power potential.
Unlike &#x27;static&#x27; wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years, tools such as Renewables.ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution. More detailed, site-specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers, and many of the larger wind developers have in-house modeling capabilities.

The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources. The strength of wind varies, and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there.

To assess prospective wind power sites, a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data. Different locations will have different wind speed distributions. The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate, but simpler model.

== Wind farms ==


A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area. The land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore. Almost all large wind turbines have the same design — a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with 3 blades, attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower.

In a wind farm, individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (often 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network. In general, a distance of 7D (7 times the rotor diameter of the wind turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system.

=== Generator characteristics and stability ===

Most modern turbines use variable speed generators combined with either a partial or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern turbines use either doubly fed electric machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full-scale converters. Black start is possible and is being further developed for places (such as Iowa) which generate most of their electricity from wind.

Transmission system operators will supply a wind farm developer with a grid code to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid. This will include the power factor, the constancy of frequency, and the dynamic behaviour of the wind farm turbines during a system fault.

=== Offshore wind power ===

Offshore wind power is wind farms in large bodies of water, usually the sea. These installations can use the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less visual impact on the landscape than land-based projects. However, the construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher.

As of November 2021, the Hornsea Wind Farm in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 1,218 MW.

=== Collection and transmission network ===
Near offshore wind farms may be connected by AC and far offshore by HVDC.

Wind power resources are not always located near to high population density. As transmission lines become longer, the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased; making it harder to transport large loads over large distances.

When the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running altogether, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.

One of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in some countries is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated areas due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. Any existing transmission lines in remote locations may not have been designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. In particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power, whether offshore or onshore. A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC super grid.

== Wind power capacity and production ==
=== Growth trends ===


In 2020, wind supplied almost 1600 TWh of electricity, which was over 5% of worldwide electrical generation and about 2% of energy consumption. With over 100 GW added during 2020, mostly in China, global installed wind power capacity reached more than 730 GW. But to help meet the Paris Agreement&#x27;s goals to limit climate change, analysts say it should expand much faster – by over 1% of electricity generation per year. Expansion of wind power is being hindered by fossil fuel subsidies.

The actual amount of electric power that wind can generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor, which varies according to equipment and location. Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations are in the range of 35% to 44%.

===Capacity factor===
Since wind speed is not constant, a wind farm&#x27;s annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Online data is available for some locations, and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output.

=== Penetration ===

Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation. Wind power&#x27;s share of worldwide electricity usage in 2021 was almost 7%, up from 3.5% in 2015.

There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management, and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large-scale penetration of wind generation on system stability.

A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different duration of time but is often quoted annually. To generate almost all electricity from wind annually requires substantial interconnection to other systems, for example some wind power in Scotland is sent to the rest of the British grid. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored, exported or curtailed. The seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include the production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long-term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes and businesses can also be programmed to vary electricity demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.

=== Variability ===



Wind power is variable, and during low wind periods, it may need to be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.

Electric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions, or system interconnection with HVDC cables.

Fluctuations in load and allowance for the failure of large fossil-fuel generating units require operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for the variability of wind generation.

Utility-scale batteries are often used to balance hourly and shorter timescale variation, but car batteries may gain ground from the mid-2020s. Wind power advocates argue that periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC.

The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with dispatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably. Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world.
Solar power tends to be complementary to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high-pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low-pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. Wind hybrid power systems are becoming more popular.

===Predictability===

For any particular generator, there is an 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% in an hour and a 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5 hours.

In summer 2021, wind power in the United Kingdom fell due to the lowest winds in seventy years, In the future, smoothing peaks by producing green hydrogen may help when wind has a larger share of generation.

While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more predictable. Weather forecasting permits the electric-power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.

It is thought that the most reliable low-carbon electricity systems will include a large share of wind power.

===Energy storage===

Typically, conventional hydroelectricity complements wind power very well. When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.

Alternatively, where a suitable head of water is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short- and long-term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher-cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.

=== Energy payback ===

The energy needed to build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life, Energy Return on Energy Invested, of wind power varies, but averages about 20–25. Thus, the energy payback time is typically around a year.

==Economics==

Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, cheaper than coal plants and new gas plants. According to BusinessGreen, wind turbines reached grid parity (the point at which the cost of wind power matches traditional sources) in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the Levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%. In 2021, the CEO of Siemens Gamesa warned that increased demand for low-cost wind turbines combined with high input costs and high costs of steel result in increased pressure on the manufacturers and decreasing profit margins.

Northern Eurasia, Canada, some parts of the United States, and Patagonia in Argentina are the best areas for onshore wind: whereas in other parts of the world solar power, or a combination of wind and solar, tend to be cheaper.

===Electric power cost and trends===
Wind power is capital intensive but has no fuel costs. The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources. However, the estimated average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including the cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be more than 20 years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially.

The presence of wind energy, even when subsidized, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimizing the use of expensive peaking power plants.

The cost has decreased as wind turbine technology has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance, and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital expenditure costs and maintenance costs have continued to decline.

In 2021, a Lazard study of unsubsidized electricity said that wind power levelized cost of electricity continues to fall but more slowly than before. The study estimated new wind-generated electricity cost from $26 to $50/MWh, compared to new gas power from $45 to $74/MWh. The median cost of fully deprecated existing coal power was $42/MWh, nuclear $29/MWh and gas $24/MWh. The study estimated offshore wind at around $83/MWh. Compound annual growth rate was 4% per year from 2016 to 2021, compared to 10% per year from 2009 to 2021.

===The value of wind power===
While the levelised costs of wind power may have reached that of traditional combustion based power technologies, the market value of the generated power is also lower due to the merit order effect, which implies that electricity market prices are lower in hours with substantial generation of variable renewable energy due to the low marginal costs of this technology. The effect has been identified in several European markets. For wind power plants exposed to electricity market pricing in markets with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources, profitability can be challenged.

===Incentives and community benefits===
Turbine prices have fallen significantly in recent years due to tougher competitive conditions such as the increased use of energy auctions, and the elimination of subsidies in many markets. As of 2021, subsidies are still often given to offshore wind. But they are generally no longer necessary for onshore wind in countries with even a very low carbon price such as China, provided there are no competing fossil fuel subsidies.

Secondary market forces provide incentives for businesses to use wind-generated power, even if there is a premium price for the electricity. For example, socially responsible manufacturers pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure. Companies use wind-generated power, and in return, they can claim that they are undertaking strong &quot;green&quot; efforts. Wind projects provide local taxes, or payments in place of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land.

The wind energy sector can also produce jobs during the construction and operating phase. Jobs include the manufacturing of wind turbines and the construction process, which includes transporting, installing, and then maintaining the turbines. An estimated 1.25 million people were employed in wind power in 2020.

==Small-scale wind power==

Small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to 50 kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines have been used for household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.

Examples of small-scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in New York City, where, since 2009, several building projects have capped their roofs with Gorlov-type helical wind turbines. Although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings&#x27; overall consumption, they help to reinforce the building&#x27;s &#x27;green&#x27; credentials in ways that &quot;showing people your high-tech boiler&quot; cannot, with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage, thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be fed into the network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators&#x27; owners to offset their energy costs.

Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries, photovoltaic, or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid.

Airborne wind turbines, such as kites, can be used in places at risk of hurricanes, as they can be taken down in advance.

== Impact on environment and landscape ==


The environmental impact of electricity generation from wind power is minor when compared to that of fossil fuel power. Wind turbines have some of the lowest life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources: far less greenhouse gas is emitted than for the average unit of electricity, so wind power helps limit climate change. Use of engineered wood may allow carbon negative wind power. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no local air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources.

Onshore wind farms can have a significant visual impact. Due to a very low surface power density and spacing requirements, wind farms typically need to be spread over more land than other power stations. Their network of turbines, access roads, transmission lines, and substations can result in &quot;energy sprawl&quot;; although land between the turbines and roads can still be used for agriculture. Some wind farms are opposed for potentially spoiling protected scenic areas, archaeological landscapes and heritage sites. A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms harmed tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views.

Habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest potential impacts on wildlife of onshore wind farms, but the worldwide ecological impact is minimal. Thousands of birds and bats, including rare species, have been killed by wind turbine blades, though wind turbines are responsible for far fewer bird deaths than fossil-fueled power stations when climate change effects are included. Not including these effects, modern wind turbines kill about 0.273 birds per GWh in comparison with 0.200 by coal power plants. The effects of wind turbines on birds can be mitigated with proper wildlife monitoring.

Many wind turbine blades are made of fiberglass, and have a lifetime of 20 years. Blades are hollow: some blades are crushed to reduce their volume and then landfilled. However, as they can take a lot of weight they can be made into long lasting small bridges for walkers or cyclists. Blade end-of-life is complicated, and blades manufactured in the 2020s are more likely to be designed to be completely recyclable.

Wind turbines also generate noise. At a distance of , this may be around 45 dB, which is slightly louder than a refrigerator. At , they become inaudible. There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects on people who live very close to wind turbines. Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims.

== Politics ==

=== Central government ===
Although wind turbines with fixed bases are a mature technology and new installations are generally no longer subsidized, floating wind turbines are a relatively new technology so some governments subsidize them, for example to use deeper waters.

Fossil fuel subsidies by some governments are slowing the growth of renewables.

Permitting of wind farms can take years and some governments are trying to speed up – the wind industry says this will help limit climate change and increase energy security – sometimes groups such as fishers resist this but governments say that rules protecting biodiversity will still be followed.

=== Public opinion ===

Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power. Bakker et al. (2012) found in their study that residents who did not want turbines built near them suffered significantly more stress than those who &quot;benefited economically from wind turbines&quot;.

Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation, onshore or near offshore wind farms are sometimes opposed for their impact on the landscape (especially scenic areas, heritage areas and archaeological landscapes), as well as noise, and impact on tourism.

In other cases, there is direct community ownership of wind farms. The hundreds of thousands of people who have become involved in Germany&#x27;s small and medium-sized wind farms demonstrate such support there.

A 2010 Harris Poll found strong support for wind power in Germany, other European countries, and the United States.

Public support in the United States has decreased from 75% in 2020 to 62% in 2021, with the Democratic Party supporting the use of wind energy twice as much as the Republican Party. President Biden has signed an executive order to begin building large scale wind farms.

In China, Shen et al. (2019) found that Chinese city-dwellers may be resistant to building wind turbines in urban areas, with a surprisingly high proportion of people citing an unfounded fear of radiation as driving their concerns. Also, the study finds that like their counterparts in OECD countries, urban Chinese respondents are sensitive to direct costs and wildlife externalities. Distributing relevant information about turbines to the public may alleviate resistance.

=== Community ===

Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms.
In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks.
Some may still object to wind farms but many say their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by air pollution, climate change and the opinions of the broader community.

In the US, wind power projects are reported to boost local tax bases, helping to pay for schools, roads, and hospitals, and to revitalize the economies of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners.

In the UK, both the National Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England have expressed concerns about the effects on the rural landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms.
Some wind farms have become tourist attractions. The Whitelee Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room, a learning hub, a café with a viewing deck and also a shop. It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre.

In Denmark, a loss-of-value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine. The loss must be at least 1% of the property&#x27;s value.

Despite this general support for the concept of wind power in the public at large, local opposition often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects.
As well as concerns about the landscape, there are concerns that some installations can produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected.

While aesthetic issues are subjective and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic, or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity, protest groups are often formed to attempt to block some wind power stations for various reasons.

Some opposition to wind farms is dismissed as NIMBYism, but research carried out in 2009 found that there is little evidence to support the belief that residents only object to wind farms because of a &quot;Not in my Back Yard&quot; attitude.

=== Geopolitics ===
Wind cannot be cut off unlike oil and gas so can contribute to energy security.

== Turbine design ==


Wind turbines are devices that convert the wind&#x27;s kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today&#x27;s wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.

Wind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind.
A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind&#x27;s energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert mechanical rotation into electrical power, and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.

In 1919, the German physicist Albert Betz showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This Betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.

The aerodynamics of a wind turbine are not straightforward. The airflow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of how energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. This affects the objects or other turbines downstream, which is known as &quot;wake effect&quot;. Also, the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.

In addition to the aerodynamic design of the blades, the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation&#x27;s rotor hub, nacelle, tower structure, generator, controls, and foundation.

== History ==
Wind power has been used as long as humans have put sails into the wind. Wind-powered machines used to grind grain and pump water, the windmill and wind pump, were developed in what is now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan by the 9th century. Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams, or later, requiring sources of fuel. Wind-powered pumps drained the polders of the Netherlands, and in arid regions such as the American mid-west or the Australian outback, wind pumps provided water for livestock and steam engines.

The first windmill used for the production of electric power was built in Scotland in July 1887 by Prof James Blyth of Anderson&#x27;s College, Glasgow (the precursor of Strathclyde University). Blyth&#x27;s high cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at Marykirk in Kincardineshire, and was used to charge accumulators developed by the Frenchman Camille Alphonse Faure, to power the lighting in the cottage, thus making it the first house in the world to have its electric power supplied by wind power. Blyth offered the surplus electric power to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electric power was &quot;the work of the devil.&quot; Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary, and Dispensary of Montrose, the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.

Across the Atlantic, in Cleveland, Ohio, a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 1887–1888 by Charles F. Brush. This was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900. The Brush wind turbine had a rotor in diameter and was mounted on an tower. Although large by today&#x27;s standards, the machine was only rated at 12 kW. The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 incandescent light bulbs, three arc lamps, and various motors in Brush&#x27;s laboratory.
With the development of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences. 
From 1932 many isolated properties in Australia ran their lighting and electric fans from batteries, charged by a &quot;Freelite&quot; wind-driven generator, producing 100watts of electrical power from as little wind speed as .

The 1973 oil crisis triggered the investigation in Denmark and the United States that led to larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power. By 2008, the U.S. installed capacity had reached 25.4 gigawatts, and by 2012 the installed capacity was 60 gigawatts. Today, wind-powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences, up to gigawatt-sized offshore wind farms that provide electric power to national electrical networks. The European Union is working to augment these prospects. 

In 2023, the global wind power sector experienced significant growth, with 116.6 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity added to the power grid, representing a 50% increase over the amount added in 2022. This surge in capacity brought the total installed wind power capacity worldwide to 1,021 GW by the end of the year, marking a growth of 13% compared to the previous year.

<doc id="277290" wikidata="Q4996716" url="?curid=277290" title="Bulldog Drummond's Secret Police">
<text>&quot;Bulldog Drummond&#x27;s Secret Police&quot; is a 1939 murder mystery film directed by James P. Hogan, based on the H. C. McNeile novel &quot;Temple Tower&quot;. It is one of many films featuring the British sleuth and adventurer Bulldog Drummond. In 1930, Fox produced &quot;Temple Tower&quot;, directed by Donald Gallaher and starring Kenneth MacKenna and Marceline Day, which was also based on the McNeile book.

The story is set 28 miles outside London in Rockingham, as a sign on the railroad station states.

==Plot==
An absent-minded Professor Downie (Forrester Harvey) makes a call upon Capt. Hugh &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond (John Howard) as he is making plans for his much-delayed wedding to fiancée Phyllis Claverling (Heather Angel) in his ancestral home Temple Tower.

The professor informs Drummond that a fortune was buried in one of the walled off storerooms underneath his estate, and that Downie was in possession of a book written in code that would lead them to discover the treasure. Unfortunately for the professor, someone else also wanted the riches and Drummond once again is dragged into the plot as the code book is stolen, Professor Downie is murdered, and Phyllis is kidnapped.

==Cast==
* Heather Angel as Phyllis Clavering 
* John Howard as Captain Hugh C. &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond
* H.B. Warner as Colonel Nielson
* Reginald Denny as Algy Longworth
* E.E. Clive as Tenny
* Elizabeth Patterson as Aunt Blanche
* Leo G. Carroll as Henry Seaton/Andrew Boulton
* Forrester Harvey as Professor Downie
* Clyde Cook as Constable Hawkins
* David Clyde as Constable Jenkins
* Neil Fitzgerald as Station Master
* Elspeth Dudgeon as Housekeeper
* Louise Campbell as Woman in Drummond&#x27;s Dream (uncredited)

==Notes==
The film uses flashbacks from previous Drummond films and dream sequences extensively, which has led some to criticize it as tiresome. Oddly, despite the phrase &quot;secret police&quot; in the title, there is nothing relating to any secret police in the plot except Col. Neilsen&#x27;s quip when several of the characters are together. The production values are high as the sets are of high quality, but the script has not received much acclaim.

<text>Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula . It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. With the exception of extremely rare native iron deposits, it is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism.

Magnetite is black or brownish-black with a metallic luster, has a Mohs hardness of 5–6 and leaves a black streak. Small grains of magnetite are very common in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

The chemical IUPAC name is iron(II,III) oxide and the common chemical name is &quot;ferrous-ferric oxide&quot;.

==Properties==
In addition to igneous rocks, magnetite also occurs in sedimentary rocks, including banded iron formations and in lake and marine sediments as both detrital grains and as magnetofossils. Magnetite nanoparticles are also thought to form in soils, where they probably oxidize rapidly to maghemite.

=== Crystal structure ===
The chemical composition of magnetite is Fe2+(Fe3+)2(O2-)4. This indicates that magnetite contains both ferrous (divalent) and ferric (trivalent) iron, suggesting crystallization in an environment containing intermediate levels of oxygen. The main details of its structure were established in 1915. It was one of the first crystal structures to be obtained using X-ray diffraction. The structure is inverse spinel, with O2- ions forming a face-centered cubic lattice and iron cations occupying interstitial sites. Half of the Fe3+ cations occupy tetrahedral sites while the other half, along with Fe2+ cations, occupy octahedral sites. The unit cell consists of thirty-twoO2- ions and unit cell length is &quot;a&quot; = 0.839 nm.

As a member of the inverse spinel group, magnetite can form solid solutions with similarly structured minerals, including ulvospinel () and magnesioferrite ().

Titanomagnetite, also known as titaniferous magnetite, is a solid solution between magnetite and ulvospinel that crystallizes in many mafic igneous rocks. Titanomagnetite may undergo oxy-exsolution during cooling, resulting in ingrowths of magnetite and ilmenite.

=== Crystal morphology and size ===
Natural and synthetic magnetite occurs most commonly as octahedral crystals bounded by {111} planes and as rhombic-dodecahedra. Twinning occurs on the {111} plane.

Hydrothermal synthesis usually produces single octahedral crystals which can be as large as across. In the presence of mineralizers such as 0.1M HI or 2M NH4Cl and at 0.207MPa at 416–800 °C, magnetite grew as crystals whose shapes were a combination of rhombic-dodechahedra forms. The crystals were more rounded than usual. The appearance of higher forms was considered as a result from a decrease in the surface energies caused by the lower surface to volume ratio in the rounded crystals.

=== Reactions ===
Magnetite has been important in understanding the conditions under which rocks form. Magnetite reacts with oxygen to produce hematite, and the mineral pair forms a buffer that can control how oxidizing its environment is (the oxygen fugacity). This buffer is known as the hematite-magnetite or HM buffer. At lower oxygen levels, magnetite can form a buffer with quartz and fayalite known as the QFM buffer. At still lower oxygen levels, magnetite forms a buffer with wüstite known as the MW buffer. The QFM and MW buffers have been used extensively in laboratory experiments on rock chemistry. The QFM buffer, in particular, produces an oxygen fugacity close to that of most igneous rocks.

Commonly, igneous rocks contain solid solutions of both titanomagnetite and hemoilmenite or titanohematite. Compositions of the mineral pairs are used to calculate oxygen fugacity: a range of oxidizing conditions are found in magmas and the oxidation state helps to determine how the magmas might evolve by fractional crystallization. Magnetite also is produced from peridotites and dunites by serpentinization.

=== Magnetic properties ===
Lodestones were used as an early form of magnetic compass. Magnetite has been a critical tool in paleomagnetism, a science important in understanding plate tectonics and as historic data for magnetohydrodynamics and other scientific fields.

The relationships between magnetite and other iron oxide minerals such as ilmenite, hematite, and ulvospinel have been much studied; the reactions between these minerals and oxygen influence how and when magnetite preserves a record of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

At low temperatures, magnetite undergoes a crystal structure phase transition from a monoclinic structure to a cubic structure known as the Verwey transition. Optical studies show that this metal to insulator transition is sharp and occurs around 120K. The Verwey transition is dependent on grain size, domain state, pressure, and the iron-oxygen stoichiometry. An isotropic point also occurs near the Verwey transition around 130K, at which point the sign of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant changes from positive to negative. The Curie temperature of magnetite is .

If magnetite is in a large enough quantity it can be found in aeromagnetic surveys using a magnetometer which measures magnetic intensities.

=== Melting point ===

Solid magnetite particles melt at about .

==Distribution of deposits==

Magnetite is sometimes found in large quantities in beach sand. Such black sands (mineral sands or iron sands) are found in various places, such as Lung Kwu Tan in Hong Kong; California, United States; and the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The magnetite, eroded from rocks, is carried to the beach by rivers and concentrated by wave action and currents. Huge deposits have been found in banded iron formations. These sedimentary rocks have been used to infer changes in the oxygen content of the atmosphere of the Earth.
Large deposits of magnetite are also found in the Atacama region of Chile (Chilean Iron Belt); the Valentines region of Uruguay; Kiruna, Sweden; the Tallawang region of New South Wales; and in the Adirondack Mountains of New York in the United States. Kediet ej Jill, the highest mountain of Mauritania, is made entirely of the mineral. In the municipalities of Molinaseca, Albares, and Rabanal del Camino, in the province of León (Spain), there is a magnetite deposit in Ordovician terrain, considered one of the largest in Europe. It was exploited between 1955 and 1982. Deposits are also found in Norway, Romania, and Ukraine. Magnetite-rich sand dunes are found in southern Peru. In 2005, an exploration company, Cardero Resources, discovered a vast deposit of magnetite-bearing sand dunes in Peru. The dune field covers 250 square kilometers (100 sq mi), with the highest dune at over 2,000 meters (6,560 ft) above the desert floor. The sand contains 10% magnetite.

In large enough quantities magnetite can affect compass navigation. In Tasmania there are many areas with highly magnetized rocks that can greatly influence compasses. Extra steps and repeated observations are required when using a compass in Tasmania to keep navigation problems to the minimum.

Magnetite crystals with a cubic habit are rare but have been found at Balmat, St. Lawrence County, New York, and at Långban, Sweden. This habit may be a result of crystallization in the presence of cations such as zinc.

Magnetite can also be found in fossils due to biomineralization and are referred to as magnetofossils. There are also instances of magnetite with origins in space coming from meteorites.

==Biological occurrences==
Biomagnetism is usually related to the presence of biogenic crystals of magnetite, which occur widely in organisms. These organisms range from magnetotactic bacteria (e.g., &quot;Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum&quot;) to animals, including humans, where magnetite crystals (and other magnetically sensitive compounds) are found in different organs, depending on the species. Biomagnetites account for the effects of weak magnetic fields on biological systems. There is also a chemical basis for cellular sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields (galvanotaxis).

Pure magnetite particles are biomineralized in magnetosomes, which are produced by several species of magnetotactic bacteria. Magnetosomes consist of long chains of oriented magnetite particle that are used by bacteria for navigation. After the death of these bacteria, the magnetite particles in magnetosomes may be preserved in sediments as magnetofossils. Some types of anaerobic bacteria that are not magnetotactic can also create magnetite in oxygen free sediments by reducing amorphic ferric oxide to magnetite.

Several species of birds are known to incorporate magnetite crystals in the upper beak for magnetoreception, which (in conjunction with cryptochromes in the retina) gives them the ability to sense the direction, polarity, and magnitude of the ambient magnetic field.

Chitons, a type of mollusk, have a tongue-like structure known as a radula, covered with magnetite-coated teeth, or denticles. The hardness of the magnetite helps in breaking down food.

Biological magnetite may store information about the magnetic fields the organism was exposed to, potentially allowing scientists to learn about the migration of the organism or about changes in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field over time.

===Human brain===

Living organisms can produce magnetite. In humans, magnetite can be found in various parts of the brain including the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, brainstem, cerebellum and basal ganglia. Iron can be found in three forms in the brain – magnetite, hemoglobin (blood) and ferritin (protein), and areas of the brain related to motor function generally contain more iron. Magnetite can be found in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is associated with information processing, specifically learning and memory. However, magnetite can have toxic effects due to its charge or magnetic nature and its involvement in oxidative stress or the production of free radicals. Research suggests that beta-amyloid plaques and tau proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease frequently occur after oxidative stress and the build-up of iron.

Some researchers also suggest that humans possess a magnetic sense, proposing that this could allow certain people to use magnetoreception for navigation. The role of magnetite in the brain is still not well understood, and there has been a general lag in applying more modern, interdisciplinary techniques to the study of biomagnetism.

Electron microscope scans of human brain-tissue samples are able to differentiate between magnetite produced by the body&#x27;s own cells and magnetite absorbed from airborne pollution, the natural forms being jagged and crystalline, while magnetite pollution occurs as rounded nanoparticles. Potentially a human health hazard, airborne magnetite is a result of pollution (specifically combustion). These nanoparticles can travel to the brain via the olfactory nerve, increasing the concentration of magnetite in the brain. In some brain samples, the nanoparticle pollution outnumbers the natural particles by as much as 100:1, and such pollution-borne magnetite particles may be linked to abnormal neural deterioration. In one study, the characteristic nanoparticles were found in the brains of 37 people: 29 of these, aged 3 to 85, had lived and died in Mexico City, a significant air pollution hotspot. Some of the further eight, aged 62 to 92, from Manchester, England, had died with varying severities of neurodegenerative diseases. Such particles could conceivably contribute to diseases like Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Though a causal link has not yet been established, laboratory studies suggest that iron oxides such as magnetite are a component of protein plaques in the brain. Such plaques have been linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Increased iron levels, specifically magnetic iron, have been found in portions of the brain in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients. Monitoring changes in iron concentrations may make it possible to detect the loss of neurons and the development of neurodegenerative diseases prior to the onset of symptoms due to the relationship between magnetite and ferritin. In tissue, magnetite and ferritin can produce small magnetic fields which will interact with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) creating contrast. Huntington patients have not shown increased magnetite levels; however, high levels have been found in study mice.

==Applications==
Due to its high iron content, magnetite has long been a major iron ore. It is reduced in blast furnaces to pig iron or sponge iron for conversion to steel.

===Magnetic recording===
Audio recording using magnetic acetate tape was developed in the 1930s. The German magnetophon first utilized magnetite powder that BASF coated onto cellulose acetate before soon switching to gamma ferric oxide for its superior morphology. Following World War II, 3M Company continued work on the German design. In 1946, the 3M researchers found they could also improve their own magnetite-based paper tape, which utilized powders of cubic crystals, by replacing the magnetite with needle-shaped particles of gamma ferric oxide (γ-Fe2O3).

===Catalysis===
Approximately 2–3% of the world&#x27;s energy budget is allocated to the Haber Process for nitrogen fixation, which relies on magnetite-derived catalysts. The industrial catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, which is usually obtained by reduction of high-purity magnetite. The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite or wüstite of a defined particle size. The magnetite (or wüstite) particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the oxygen in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of wüstite, which in turn is surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high-surface-area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst.

=== Magnetite nanoparticles ===
Magnetite micro- and nanoparticles are used in a variety of applications, from biomedical to environmental. One use is in water purification: in high gradient magnetic separation, magnetite nanoparticles introduced into contaminated water will bind to the suspended particles (solids, bacteria, or plankton, for example) and settle to the bottom of the fluid, allowing the contaminants to be removed and the magnetite particles to be recycled and reused. This method works with radioactive and carcinogenic particles as well, making it an important cleanup tool in the case of heavy metals introduced into water systems.

Another application of magnetic nanoparticles is in the creation of ferrofluids. These are used in several ways. Ferrofluids can be used for targeted drug delivery in the human body. The magnetization of the particles bound with drug molecules allows &quot;magnetic dragging&quot; of the solution to the desired area of the body. This would allow the treatment of only a small area of the body, rather than the body as a whole, and could be highly useful in cancer treatment, among other things. Ferrofluids are also used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology.

===Coal mining industry===
For the separation of coal from waste, dense medium baths were used. This technique employed the difference in densities between coal (1.3–1.4 tonnes per m3) and shales (2.2–2.4 tonnes per m3). In a medium with intermediate density (water with magnetite), stones sank and coal floated.

==Magnetene==
Magnetene is a two-dimensional flat sheet of magnetite noted for its ultra-low-friction properties.

<doc id="277298" wikidata="Q946305" url="?curid=277298" title="Sam Nunn">
<text>Samuel Augustus Nunn Jr. (born September 8, 1938) is an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Georgia (1972–1997) as a member of the Democratic Party.

After leaving Congress, Nunn co-founded the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan global security organization focused on reducing nuclear, biological, and emerging technology threats imperiling humanity, for which he is the co-chair. His political experience and credentials on national defense reportedly earned him consideration as a potential running mate for presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama after they became their party&#x27;s nominees.

==Early life==
Nunn was born in Macon, Georgia, the son of Mary Elizabeth (née Cannon) and Samuel Augustus Nunn, who was an attorney and mayor of Perry, Georgia. Nunn was raised in Perry. He is a grandnephew of Congressman Carl Vinson.

Nunn was an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. In high school, Nunn was a standout athlete, captaining the school&#x27;s basketball team to the state championship.

Nunn attended Georgia Tech in 1956, where he was initiated as a brother of Phi Delta Theta. He transferred to Emory University in 1959 and received his undergraduate degree in 1961. He then received a degree from the Emory University School of Law in 1962.

==Early career ==
After active-duty service in the United States Coast Guard, he served six years in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve and attained the rank of petty officer. He was also a Congressional staff member.

Nunn returned to Perry, Georgia, where he practiced law and managed his family&#x27;s farm. He later was president of the Perry Chamber of Commerce.

==Political career==
Nunn first entered politics as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in 1968. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1972, defeating appointed U.S. senator David H. Gambrell in the Democratic primary and U.S. Rep. Fletcher Thompson in the general election. Nunn retired from the Senate in 1997, offering a lack of &quot;zest and enthusiasm&quot; as justification.

During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Nunn served as the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He also served on the Intelligence and Small Business Committees. His legislative achievements include the landmark Department of Defense Reorganization Act, drafted with the late senator Barry Goldwater, and the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which provided assistance to Russia and the former Soviet republics for securing and destroying their excess nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program deactivated more than 7,600 nuclear warheads. He was supposedly the &quot;top choice&quot; to be Secretary of Defense or State in 1992 and 1996 and in a prospective Gore cabinet in 2000.

Overall, Nunn was a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who often broke with his party on a host of social and economic issues. He opposed the budget bill of 1993, which included provisions to raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit. He neither supported nor opposed Hillary Clinton&#x27;s attempt to establish universal health care, though he spoke out very strongly against the proposed insurance mandate.

Nunn actively worked to block President Bill Clinton&#x27;s proposal to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military. LGBT activist David Mixner openly referred to Nunn as an &quot;old fashioned bigot&quot; for opposing Clinton&#x27;s plan to lift the military, though this was also reported to have angered the White House.

In 2008, Nunn endorsed a new Pentagon study to examine the issue of homosexuals serving openly in the military: &quot;I think [when] 15 years go by on any personnel policy, it&#x27;s appropriate to take another look at it—see how it&#x27;s working, ask the hard questions, hear from the military. Start with a Pentagon study.&quot;

According to opensecrets.org, Sam Nunn received about $2.4 million during his 1989–1994 political career. His main contributors were the finance/insurance/real estate sector (totaling $411,665; $46,660 was received from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.), the defense industry, lawyers and lobbyists, the alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages industry (including Coca-Cola), and the agriculture sector.

He voted in favor of school prayer, capping punitive damage awards, amending the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget, and limiting death penalty appeals. On certain issues like abortion, the environment, gun control, and affirmative action, Nunn took a more liberal line. He consistently voted in favor of increased immigration. One of his most controversial votes was his vote against the Gulf War.

In September 1994, Nunn, former president Jimmy Carter and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell were asked by President Bill Clinton to go to Haiti to force the departure of the military dictator Lieutenant General Raoul Cédras. In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, the delegation wanted Nunn and Powell to urge Cédras to step down and leave the country. Cédras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the country&#x27;s elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn&#x27;s delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. &quot;As all of you know, at my request, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators&#x27; departure. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days. They have worked tirelessly, almost around the clock, and I want to thank them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans&quot;, Clinton said.

Upon his exit from the Senate at the end of 1996, Nunn was the recipient of bipartisan praise from his colleagues. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia concluded, &quot;Senator Nunn quickly established himself as one of the leading experts in the Congress and, indeed, all of the United States on national security and foreign policy. He gained a reputation in our country and, indeed, worldwide as a global thinker, and that is where I think he will make his greatest contribution in the years to come, wherever he may be, in terms of being a global thinker. His approach to national security issues has been guided by one fundamental criteria: What Sam Nunn believes is in the best interest of the United States of America.&quot;

==Post-Congressional life==

Nunn founded the Nuclear Threat Initiative in 2001 and w as co-chair and CEO until June 2017, when he became co-chair with Ted Turner and Ernest J. Moniz.

In addition to his work with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, Nunn continues his service in the public policy arena as a distinguished professor in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech. There, he hosted the biennial Sam Nunn Policy Forum, a policy meeting that brings together noted academic, government, and private-sector experts on technology, public policy, and international affairs to address issues of immediate importance to the nation.

Nunn was an active advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He signed a number of the organization&#x27;s bipartisan policy statements on important issues ranging from climate change to enhanced interrogation practices and nonproliferation.

Additionally, Nunn is Chairman Emeritus of the board of trustees for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. At CSIS, Nunn and former senator and United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen joined for a series of public roundtable discussions designed to focus Americans on the seminal issues that the United States must face. The Cohen-Nunn Dialogues featured top thought leaders, public policy experts, prominent journalists, and leading scholars.

Nunn is a retired partner in the law firm of King &amp; Spalding. He also was a board member of The Coca-Cola Company. In 2005, Nunn teamed up with former senator Fred Thompson to promote a new film, &quot;Last Best Chance&quot;, on the dangers of excess nuclear weapons and materials. The film was produced by the Nuclear Threat Initiative and aired on HBO in October 2005. He gave a full presentation outlining his goals at the Commonwealth Club of California.

Nunn—along with William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz—called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in five &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-eds proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to the vision. The four created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers. You can&#x27;t deter a group who is willing to commit suicide. We are in a different era. You have to understand the world has changed.&quot;

In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled &quot;Nuclear Tipping Point&quot;, also produced by the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.

Nunn was a member of the supervisory council of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe, a not-for-profit organization uniting leading experts on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, materials and delivery vehicles. He also was on the Board of Advisors for the National Bureau of Asian Research, a non-profit, nonpartisan research institution.

In June 2013, Nunn added his voice to public support for an updated nuclear-arms limitation agreement with Russia. The 1992 Nunn-Lugar agreement had just expired at a time of increasing political tension between the two nations. Nunn applauded the determination of presidents Obama and Putin to renew its core provisions, while urging further work to agree on chemical and biological weapons limits also.

Nunn also was a member the Board of Curators for the Georgia Historical Society. He also was an advisory board member of Theranos, a fraudulent biotech company.

Several books have been written about the life and career of Sam Nunn. &quot;The Best President the Nation Never Had: A Memoir of Working with Sam Nunn&quot; was written in 2017 by his former Chief of Staff, Roland McElroy, and details Nunn&#x27;s early years as a candidate for Senate. &quot;Sam Nunn: Statesman of the Nuclear Age&quot;, by Frank Leith Jones, takes a more comprehensive look at Nunn&#x27;s four-term Senate career, focusing on his accomplishments in nuclear and national security policy. 

In 2019, the US Navy announced that an Arleigh Burke-class Missile Destroyer will be named the USS Sam Nunn.
==Speculation of 2008 presidential or vice-presidential candidacy==
On August 19, 2007, Nunn said he would not decide on a presidential bid until after the 2008 primary season, when presumptive nominees by both parties would emerge. However, speculation over a Nunn White House bid ended on April 18, 2008, when he endorsed Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama.

Despite having publicly declared his lack of interest in being a candidate for vice president, Nunn continued to be mentioned by some political pundits and politicians as a potential running mate for Obama.

In an interview published on June 4, 2008, by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, former president Jimmy Carter said that he favored Nunn (a fellow Georgian) as Obama&#x27;s possible choice for vice president. Peggy Noonan, a columnist and former Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush speechwriter also expressed her support for Nunn. In an interview with CNBC on August 22, 2008, billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that he favored Nunn as Obama&#x27;s choice for vice president.

==Personal life==
Nunn is married to the former Colleen O&#x27;Brien. Nunn met his future wife at the U.S. Embassy in Paris while she was working for the Central Intelligence Agency. They have two children, Mary Michelle Nunn and Samuel Brian Nunn. Michelle Nunn is CEO of Points of Light and CEO of CARE, she ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2014.

According to the Lee Iacocca book, &quot;Talking Straight&quot; (1988), Chrysler Corporation came under scrutiny for selling new vehicles which were driven by company executives before the odometers were connected. Iacocca, Chrysler&#x27;s CEO, was not concerned about the scandal at first but, within days of a meeting with Nunn in 1987 in which Nunn spoke of his own recently purchased Chrysler Fifth Avenue, Iacocca launched a detailed investigation into the claims, and extended warranties – and public apologies – to numerous current Chrysler owners.

In 1989, it was reported that Nunn had had a drunk driving crash in 1964. This report emerged during the United States Secretary of Defense confirmation hearings of ex-Senator John Tower. Nunn was opposing Tower due to Tower&#x27;s alleged drinking problems.

Senator Nunn&#x27;s membership in Augusta National Golf Club became the focus of a campaign by women seeking membership in the exclusive all-male club in 2002. The club had admitted its first African American member in 1990 but was still closed to women. The Club chose to air the masters&#x27; without commercials rather than succumb to the pressure to open admissions to women.

Nunn is a Freemason.

<doc id="277301" wikidata="Q3922105" url="?curid=277301" title="Principles of Compiler Design">
<text>Principles of Compiler Design, by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman, is a classic textbook on compilers for computer programming languages. Both of the authors won the 2020 Turing Award for their work on compilers.

It is often called the &quot;green dragon book&quot; and its cover depicts a knight and a dragon in battle; the dragon is green, and labeled &quot;Complexity of Compiler Design&quot;, while the knight wields a lance and a shield labeled &quot;LALR parser generator&quot; and &quot;Syntax Directed Translation&quot; respectively, and rides a horse labeled &quot;Data Flow Analysis&quot;. The book may be called the &quot;green dragon book&quot; to distinguish it from its successor, Aho, Sethi &amp; Ullman&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which is the &quot;red dragon book&quot;. The second edition of &quot;Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools&quot; added a fourth author, Monica S. Lam, and the dragon became purple; hence becoming the &quot;&quot;. The book also contains the entire code for making a compiler. 
The back cover offers the original inspiration of the cover design: The dragon is replaced by windmills, and the knight is Don Quixote.

The book was published by Addison-Wesley, . The acknowledgments mention that the book was entirely typeset at Bell Labs using troff on the Unix operating system, little of which had, at that time, been seen outside the Laboratories.

<text>The bicycle business of the Wright brothers, the Wright Cycle Company (originally the &quot;Wright Cycle Exchange&quot;) successively occupied six different locations in Dayton, Ohio. Orville and Wilbur Wright began their bicycle repair, rental and sales business in 1892, while continuing to operate a print shop (they ended their local newspaper business in 1890). These shops helped them fund their aeronautical studies.

In 1896, they began manufacturing and selling bicycles of their own design, the &quot;Van Cleve&quot;, named after an early settler of Dayton, and the &quot;St. Clair&quot;, named after a territorial governor. They invented the self-oiling hub and devised the innovation of machining the crankarm and pedal on the left side with left-hand threads to prevent the pedal from coming unscrewed while cycling. The brick building at 22 South Williams St., where the Wrights worked from 1895 to 1897, is the only extant building on its original foundation and in its original location that housed a Wright bicycle shop. They ran their printing shop on the second-floor. The 22 South Williams Street building is part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and the National Aviation Heritage Area.

The Wrights used the profits from the Wright Cycle Company to finance their aviation experiments. In 1901, they fitted a third bicycle wheel horizontally above the front wheel of one of their St. Clair bicycles and used the apparatus as a test platform to study airfoil design. They built a six-foot wind tunnel on the second floor of their bicycle shop at 1127 West Third St., the last location of their bicycle business, and from October to December they conducted pioneering tests in the tunnel of over 200 shapes of scale-model wings.

In that same building, they designed and constructed their gliders and first airplane, the Wright Flyer, which cost under $1,000 to build. The shop closed in 1909 and they started their aviation company. In 1937, with Orville&#x27;s cooperation, the building at 1127 West Third St. was moved to Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan, by Henry Ford.
==Shop locations==

With the exception of the West Second Street location, which is located near the Schuster Center on the other side of the Miami River, all of the shops are located within about one block of each other.

*1892—Wright Cycle Exchange at 1005 West Third Street 
*1893—Wright Cycle Exchange at 1015 West Third Street 
*1893 to 1894—Wright Cycle Exchange at 1034 West Third Street. The name later changed to Wright Cycle Co. 
*1895 to 1897—Wright Cycle Co. at two locations—the main store at 22 South Williams Street, and a branch store in downtown Dayton at 23 West Second Street. The branch closed in 1896. 
*1897 to 1909—The Wright Cycle Co. at 1127 West Third Street.

== Wright Cycle Exchange (1892–1893) ==
After both brothers purchased bicycles in the spring of 1892, their aptitude with bicycle repairs and the high demand for repairmen led them to starting their own repair shop. In December 1892, they rented a storefront at 1005 West Third Street, where they officially started the Wright Cycle Exchange. They sold bicycles from $40 to $100. In addition to these sales, they rented bicycles, and sold parts and accessories. The brothers then moved the shop to 1015 West Third street, where they even had a newspaper ad for the Exchange. By the end of 1893, the shop was moved to 1034 West Third Street, where the name was changed from Wright Cycle Exchange to Wright Cycle Company.

== Wright Cycle Company (1894–1909) ==
In 1895 the Wright Brothers moved to 22 South Williams Street, the only location of the six that is still standing today. It has been turned into the Wright Cycle Company Complex and the National Aviation Heritage Area. A second branch opened at 20 West Second Street in 1895, but closed down the next year. In 1896 the Wright Brothers began selling their own bikes. They sold the more expensive &quot;Van Cleve&quot;, and the cheaper &quot;St. Clair.&quot; Orville made his own additions to the bicycles, including the Oil-Retaining Wheel Hub and the Coaster-Brakes. This was the greatest era of success for the Wright Brothers. They operated at 22 South Williams Street from 1895 to 1897.

In 1897 the Wright Brothers moved their shop to 1127 West Third Street, the sixth and final location for the Wright Cycle Company. In 1900 they produced their Van Cleve Catalog, a catalog which promoted their famous &quot;Van Cleve&quot;, which now came in two models. After becoming increasingly invested in the Wright Glider, the Brothers manufactured very few bicycles after 1902, and completely stopped after 1904. In 1909, the shop at 1127 West Third Street was converted completely for airplanes, and the Wright Brothers sold the company to W.F. Meyers, who continued to sell &quot;Van Cleves&quot; until 1939. This marks the end of the Wright Cycle Company.
