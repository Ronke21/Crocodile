<text>Pueblo refers to the settlements and to the Native American tribes of the Pueblo peoples in the Southwestern United States, currently in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. The permanent communities, including some of the oldest continually occupied settlements in the United States, are called pueblos (lowercased).

Spanish explorers of northern New Spain used the term &quot;pueblo&quot; to refer to permanent Indigenous towns they found in the region, mainly in New Mexico and parts of Arizona, in the former province of Nuevo México. This term continued to be used to describe the communities housed in apartment structures built of stone, adobe, and other local material. The structures were usually multi-storied buildings surrounding an open plaza, with rooms accessible only through ladders raised and lowered by the inhabitants, thus protecting them from break-ins and unwanted guests. Larger pueblos were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Puebloan people.

Several federally recognized tribes have traditionally resided in pueblos of such design. Later Pueblo Deco and modern Pueblo Revival architecture, which mixes elements of traditional Pueblo and Hispano design, has continued to be a popular architectural style in New Mexico. 

The term is now part of the proper name of some historical sites, such as Pueblo of Acoma.

==Etymology and usage==
The word is the Spanish word both for &quot;town&quot; or &quot;village&quot; and for &quot;people&quot;. It comes from the Latin root word meaning &quot;people&quot;. Spanish colonials applied the term to their own civic settlements, but to only those Native American settlements having fixed locations and permanent buildings. 

In the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico, specifically in the region between Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Taos, the word &quot;pueblo&quot; defines a &quot;distinct cultural group in the Southwestern United States&quot; and their villages. The Holmes Museum of Anthropology defines this specific group as a &quot;common culture with individual variances [that] connects them.

Less-permanent native settlements (such as those found in California) were often referred to as &quot;rancherías&quot;, however, the oldest area of Los Angeles was known as &quot;El Pueblo de Nuestra Señorala Reina de los Ángeles del Rio de Porciúncula&quot; or El Pueblo de Los Angeles for short.

== Pueblo tribes ==
Of the federally recognized Native American communities in the Southwest, those designated by the King of Spain as pueblo at the time Spain ceded territory to the United States, after the American Revolutionary War, are legally recognized as Pueblo by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some of the pueblos also came under the jurisdiction of the United States, in its view, by its treaty with Mexico, which had briefly gained rule over territory in the Southwest ceded by Spain after Mexican independence. There are 21 federally recognized Pueblos that are home to Pueblo peoples. Their official federal names are as follows:

* Hopi Tribe of Arizona (Uto-Aztecan)
* Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico (Keresan)
* Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico (Keresan)
* Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico (Keresan)
* Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico (Keresan)
* Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico (Keresan)
* Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico (Keresan)
* Santo Domingo Pueblo (also Kewa Pueblo), New Mexico (Keresan)
* Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, Texas (Kiowa-Tanoan)
* Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico (Zuni)

One unrecognized tribe, the Piro/Manso/Tiwa Indian Tribe of the Pueblo of San Juan Guadalupe is currently petitioning the US Department of the Interior for federal recognition.

== Civic institutions ==

Each Pueblo is autonomous with its own governmental structure. Several organizations serve to unite the interests of difference Pueblos including the Albuquerque-based All Pueblo Council of Governors who collectively negotiates for land and water rights and advocates for Pueblo interests with the state and federal government. The interests of Eight Northern Pueblos are served by the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council based in Ohkay Owingeh (formerly San Juan Pueblo). Cochiti, Jemez, Sandia, Santa Ana, and Zia are served by the Five Sandoval Indian Pueblos, a nonprofit organization based in Rio Rancho.

The Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, founded in 1976 in Albuquerque, educates the public about all Pueblos through art, dance, and educational experiences. The center has a museum that presents Pueblo history and artifacts, and an interactive Pueblo House museum. An archive holds a collection of photographs, books, and tape recordings of oral histories. It also has a café and a restaurant, Indian Pueblo Kitchen, serving Indigenous cuisine.
==Historical places==
Pre-Columbian towns and villages in the Southwest, such as Acoma, were located in defensible positions, for example, on high steep mesas. Anthropologists and official documents often refer to ancient residents of the area as pueblo cultures. For example, the National Park Service states, &quot;The Late Puebloan cultures built the large, integrated villages found by the Spaniards when they began to move into the area.&quot;
The people of some pueblos, such as Taos Pueblo, still inhabit centuries-old adobe pueblo buildings.

Contemporary residents often maintain other homes outside the historic pueblos. Adobe and light construction methods resembling adobe now dominate architecture at the many pueblos of the area, in nearby towns or cities, and in much of the American Southwest.

In addition to contemporary pueblos, numerous ruins of archeological interest are located throughout the Southwest. Some are of relatively recent origin. Others are of prehistoric origin, such as the cliff dwellings and other habitations of the Ancestral Puebloans, who emerged as a people around the 12th century BCE and began to construct their pueblos about 750–900 CE.

== Feast days ==
Many pueblos participate in syncretism between Indigenous Pueblo religion and Roman Catholicism. The pueblos welcome outsiders to participate in feast days, in which the Pueblo communities hold seasonal ceremonial dances, and certain households volunteer to feed visitors meals. Photography is forbidden. Visitors are advised to confirm events in advance with the Pueblos.

Dances include the antelope, bow-and-arrow, Comanche, corn, basket, buffalo, deer, harvest, Matachines, and turtle dances.

<text>The Pig () or sometimes translated as the Boar is the twelfth of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in Chinese zodiac, in relation to the Chinese calendar and system of horology, and paralleling the system of ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. Although the term &quot;&quot; (etymologically referring to a &quot;[circle of] little animals&quot;) is used in the phrase &quot;Chinese zodiac&quot;, there is a major difference between the Chinese usage and Western astrology: the zodiacal animals (including the zodiacal Pig) do not relate to the zodiac as the area of the sky that extends approximately 8° north or south (as measured in celestial latitude) of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun, the Moon, and visible planets across the celestial sphere&#x27;s constellations, over the course of the year.

In Chinese astrology, &quot;zodiacal&quot; animals refer to fixed cycles of twelve animals. The same cycle of twelve is used for cycles of years and cycles of hours. In the case of years, the cycle of twelve corresponds to the twelve-year cycle of Jupiter. In the case of the hours, the twelve hours represent twelve double-hours for each period of night and day. In the continuous sexagenary cycle of sixty years, every twelfth year corresponds to &quot;hai&quot;, (the twelfth of the twelve Earthly Branches); this re-recurring twelfth year is commonly called the Year of the Pig (). 

There are five types of Pigs, named after the Chinese elements. In order, they are: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth. These correspond to the Heavenly Stems. Thus, there are five pig years in every sexagenary cycle. For example, in the year 2019, the Earthly Branch is the twelfth, &quot;hài&quot;, and the Heavenly Stem is the sixth, &quot;jǐ&quot; . The Chinese New Year in 2019 is February fifth: this corresponds with the beginning of both the sexegenary year of &quot;jǐ&quot; &quot;hài&quot; and also the zodiac year of the Earth Pig.

In the Japanese zodiac and the Tibetan zodiac, the Pig is referred to as the boar. In the Dai zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the elephant. In the Gurung zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the deer. The Malay zodiac replaces the Pig with the tortoise.

According to the myths, the Pig was the last to arrive when the Jade Emperor called for the great meeting. Other sources said that Buddha called for a great meeting when he was about to leave the Earth. The Pig arrived last.

Yet another legend has it that The Emperor organized a race to ascertain the order of the animals in the Zodiac. The pig not having arrived long after all of the other animals, he was about to call it a day when an oink and squeal were heard. The term &quot;lazy pig&quot; comes from this incident; the Pig had become hungry during the race, stopped for a feast, and then promptly fell asleep. The pig finally completed the race, however, and was accordingly named the 12th and last animal of the zodiac cycle.

Other sources say that given his very stout form, he was just too slow a swimmer, and thus he could not do anything against the other animals (or conversely that he was so fast he went up the wrong side of the river first). 

==Years and the Five Elements==

===The Pig and the Elements===
The natural element of the Pig is Water. Thus, it is commonly associated with emotions and intuitions. Yet, given that along with the elements (called the Celestial stem), the animal zodiac (called the Earthly stem) also follows a cycle, each of the elements affect the characteristic of the same Earthly stem (&quot;see&quot; Sexagenary cycle).

However, the Pig is yin, and thus only the negative aspects of the elements can be attached to them, thus only 5 kinds of Pigs are found in the zodiac. They are the following:
:乙亥 (yǐhài) – The Wood Pig
:丁亥 (dīnghài) – The Fire Pig
:己亥 (jǐhài) – The Earth Pig
:辛亥 (xīnhài) – The Metal Pig
:癸亥 (guǐhài) – The Water Pig

===The Years of the Pig===

People born within these date ranges can be said to have been born in the &quot;Year of the Pig&quot;, while bearing the following elemental sign:

==Hour of the Pig==
Similarly to the usage of the traditional Japanese clock, each day-night period was divided into 12 double-hours, each of which corresponding with one of the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac, with similar symbolic motif and astrological significance. The first of the twelve double hours (the Hour of the Rat) encompasses midnight, at the middle of the double hour, corresponding with 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., with midnight being the midpoint of the first double-hour. The animals in the hourly sequence are the same and in the same order as in the yearly sequence. The Pig is the last in the sequence, with the Hour of the Pig corresponding to the double-hour 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., also known as the hour &quot;hai&quot; (亥). 

Given that the traditional Chinese day-night cycle was composed of 12 hours, each sign is given to the different signs of the zodiac. The Pig is assigned to govern the time between 21:00 hrs to 22:59 hrs. According to tradition, this is the time when the Pig is doing what it does best (sleeping and enjoying the sweet life).

In terms of astrology, the hours in which people were born (technically termed as the Ascendant) are the second most important facet of their astrology. Thus, this alters greatly the characteristics. Even if people were born in any year governed by another animal (for example, anyone born on 20 December 2000, i.e. year of the Dragon) will display strong characteristics of the Pig. Thus, they may be fierce and strong like the Dragon, but at the same time emotional and intuitive like the Pig.

==Basic astrology elements==
==Cultural notes==
Some Chinese Muslims will say that they were born in the year of the &quot;hai&quot;, (twelfth and final year of the zodiac) to avoid saying the &quot;Pig&quot;. This is because pigs are haram (forbidden to eat) in Islam and therefore Muslims consider pigs unclean.

Increasing numbers of countries and regions now issue lunar new year stamps. For the 2019 Year of the Pig, the USC U.S.-China Institute collected stamps from 56 jurisdictions.

<text>The dragon () is the fifth of the 12-year cycle of animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar. The Year of the Dragon is associated with the Earthly Branch symbol 辰 (pinyin: &quot;chén&quot;).

It has been proposed that the Earthly Branch character may have been associated with scorpions; it may have symbolized the star Antares. In the Buddhist calendar used in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, the dragon is replaced by the nāga. In the Gurung zodiac, the dragon is replaced by the eagle. In the Old Turkic calendar it is replaced by a fish or crocodile. Early Persian translations of the medieval period change the dragon to a sea serpent, although in current times it is generally referred to as whale.

During China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, there was an attempt to replace the dragon with the giant panda; however, the movement was short lived.

==Years and the five elements==
People born within these date ranges can be said to have been born in the &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, while bearing the following elemental sign:
There are typically marked spikes in the birth rates of countries that use the Chinese zodiac or places with substantial Chinese populations during the Year of the Dragon, because these births are considered to be lucky and have desirable characteristics that supposedly lead to better life outcomes. The relatively recent phenomenon of planning a child&#x27;s birth in a Year of the Dragon has led to hospital capacity issues and even an uptick in infant mortality rates toward the end of these years due to strained neonatal resources.

==Compatibility==
Cycle (trine group): Dragon needs Monkey, Monkey needs Rat, Rat needs Dragon; It is opposed to or rivals the Dog.

<text>The snake () is the sixth of the twelve-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar. The Year of the Snake is associated with the Earthly Branch symbol . Besides its use in the cycle of years, the zodiacal snake is otherwise used to also represent hours of the day. Snakes have a long and complicated place in Chinese mythology and culture.

==Other uses==
The same twelve animals are also used to symbolize the cycle of hours in the day, each being associated with a two-hour time period. The hour of the snake is 9:00 to 11:00 a.m., the time when the Sun warms up the Earth, and snakes are said to slither out of their holes. The month of the snake is the 4th month of the Chinese lunar calendar and it usually falls within the months of May through June depending on the Chinese to Gregorian calendar conversion.
The reason the animal signs are referred to as zodiacal is that one&#x27;s personality is said to be influenced by the animal signs ruling the time of birth, together with elemental aspects of the animal signs within the sexagenary cycle. Similarly, the year governed by a particular animal sign is supposed to be characterized by it, with the effects particularly strong for people who were born in any year governed by the same animal sign.

==Symbology==
In Chinese symbology, snakes are regarded as intelligent, with a tendency to lack scruples.

==Origin myth==
According to one legend, there is a reason for the order of the animals in the cycle. A race was held to cross a great river, and the order of the animals in the cycle was based upon their order in finishing the race. In this story, the snake compensated for not being the best swimmer by hitching a hidden ride on the Horse&#x27;s hoof. When the horse was about to cross the finish line, the snake jumped out, scaring the horse, and thus edging it out for sixth place.

==Years and elements==

According to Chinese and related traditions, people born within the date ranges of the snake year have been said to have been born in the &quot;Year of the Snake&quot;. Each snake year may traditionally be said to correspond with a cycle of five changes of Wuxing (Chinese philosophy), often translated as &quot;elements&quot;. The following table lists dates for years of the snake together with the associated elemental signs:
In Japan, the new sign of the zodiac starts on 1 January, while in China it starts, according to the traditional Chinese calendar, at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February, so that persons born in January or February may have two different signs in the two countries, but persons born in late February (i.e. on or after 20 February) automatically have one sign in both countries.

==Basic astrological associations==

Astrology is a cross-cultural phenomenon which remains popular in many cultures or subcultures. These modern trends include a tendency towards syncretism, in which various beliefs of different origin are compounded together. The following table gives examples of this, with such popular ideas as lucky numbers (numerology), lucky colors and lucky times (general aspects of the idea of luck), together with the suggestions toward choosing a suitable partner for an intimate relationship, marriage, or business, for people born during a snake year or generally for the year. 


The snake is the sixth of the twelve signs and belongs to the second trine, with the ox (second sign, 牛, Earthly branch: 丑) and the rooster (tenth sign, , Earthly branch: 酉), with which it is most compatible. The pig is the most incompatible.

== Cultural notes ==
A Snake Year is sometimes referred to as a Little Dragon Year to assuage possible feelings of inadequacy among people born during a Snake Year.

<text>The [[Goat]] (, sometimes also translated Sheep or Ram) is the eighth of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar. This zodiacal sign is often referred to as the &quot;Ram&quot; or &quot;Sheep&quot; sign, since the Chinese word &quot;yáng&quot; is more accurately translated as [[Caprinae]], a taxonomic subfamily that includes both goats and sheep, but contrasts with other animal subfamily types such as Bovinae, Antilopinae, and other taxonomic considerations which may be encountered in the case of the larger family of Bovidae in Chinese mythology, which also includes the Ox (zodiac). The Year of the Goat is associated with the 8th Earthly Branch symbol,  (&quot;wèi&quot;).

==Goat or Sheep==
The Chinese word &quot;yáng&quot; refers to both goats and sheep, whereas the terms &quot;shānyáng&quot; () and &quot;miányáng&quot; () refer exclusively to goats and sheep, respectively. In English, the sign (originally based on a horned animal) may be called either. The interpretation of goat or sheep depends on culture. In Vietnamese, the sign is &quot;mùi&quot;, which is unambiguously goat. In Japan, on the other hand, the sign is &quot;hitsuji,&quot; sheep; while in Korea and Mongolia, the sign is ram or sheep. Within China, there may be a regional distinction with the zodiacal &quot;yáng&quot; more likely to be thought of as a goat in the south, while tending to be thought of as a sheep in the north.

==Characteristics==
The Chinese commonly regard sheep as an auspicious animal, and the year of the sheep, therefore, heralds a year of promise and prosperity. &quot;Yáng&quot; (羊) is a component of another written Chinese character &quot;xiang&quot; (), which means auspiciousness, and the two were interchangeable in ancient Chinese, according to one source. It is also a part of the character &quot;shan&quot; (), which counts kindness and benevolence as among its meanings.

Individuals born in this zodiac year have been supposed to share certain characteristics with other individuals also born in years of the same animal sign. Similarly, years sharing the same animal sign have been supposed to share certain characteristics, repeating over their 12/60 year cycle. The shared characteristics in this case are traits attributed to goats.

Due to the lunisolar nature of the traditional Chinese calendar system, the zodiacal year does not align with the Gregorian calendar: new years are determined by a system which results in each new year beginning on a new moon sometime between late January to mid-to-late February. Goat aspects can also enter by other factors or measures, such as hourly.

In Chinese astrology, Goats are described as peace-loving, kind, and popular. With the addition of the Wood element, the Goat characteristic is thought to love peace and to be helpful and trusting, but yet also to be clinging and resistant to change.

==Years and the Five Elements==

People born within these date ranges can be said to have been born in the &quot;Year of the Goat&quot;, while also bearing the following elemental sign:

<text>The Ox () is the second of the 12-year periodic sequence (cycle) of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar, and also appears in related calendar systems. The Chinese term translated here as &quot;ox&quot; is in Chinese &quot;niú &quot; (), a word generally referring to cows, bulls, or neutered types of the bovine family, such as common cattle or water buffalo. The zodiacal ox may be construed as male, female, neutered, intersex (formerly referred to as hermaphroditic), and either singular or plural. The Year of the Ox is also denoted by the Earthly Branch symbol &quot;chǒu&quot; (). The term &quot;&quot; ultimately derives from an Ancient Greek term referring to a &quot;circle of little animals&quot;. There are also a yearly month of the ox and a daily hour of the ox (Chinese double hour, 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.). Years of the oxen (cows) are cyclically differentiated by correlation to the Heavenly Stems cycle, resulting in a repeating cycle of five years of the ox/cow (over a sixty-year period), each ox/cow year also being associated with one of the Chinese wǔxíng, also known as the &quot;five elements&quot;, or &quot;phases&quot;: the &quot;Five Phases&quot; being Fire ( &quot;huǒ&quot;), Water ( &quot;shuǐ&quot;), Wood ( &quot;mù&quot;), Metal ( &quot;jīn&quot;), and Earth ( &quot;tǔ&quot;). The Year of the Ox follows after the Year of the Rat (the first year of the zodiacal cycle) which happened in 2020 and is then followed by the Year of the Tiger, which happened in 2022.

==Zodiac==

The term &quot;zodiacal&quot; refers to the classification scheme based on the lunar calendar that assigns an animal and its reputed attributes to each year in a repeating 12-year cycle. The 12-year cycle is an approximation to the 11.85-year orbital period of Jupiter. Originating from China, this form of the zodiac (with some variations) has been popular for a long time in many East Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. The ox symbolizes diligence and patience. The people with this age have progressed steadily and owns persistent strength. They are very determined but stubborn.

===Meaning===
The Ox (牛) is the second of the 12-year periodic sequence (cycle) of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar, and also appears in related calendar systems. The Chinese term translated here as ox is in Chinese niú (牛), a word generally referring to cows, bulls, or native varieties of the bovine family, such as the water buffalo in South-East Asia. The zodiacal ox may be construed as male, female, neutered, hermaphroditic, and either singular or plural. The Year of the Ox is also denoted by the Earthly Branch symbol chǒu (丑). The term &quot;zodiac&quot; ultimately derives from an Ancient Greek term referring to a &quot;circle of little animals&quot;. There are also a yearly month of the ox and a daily hour of the ox (Chinese double hour, 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.). Years of the oxen (cows) are cyclically differentiated by correlation to the Heavenly Stems cycle, resulting in a repeating cycle of five years of the ox/cow (over a sixty-year period), each ox/cow year also being associated with one of the Chinese wǔxíng, also known as the &quot;five elements&quot;, or &quot;phases&quot;: the &quot;Five Phases&quot; being Fire (火 huǒ), Water (水 shuǐ), Wood (木 mù), Metal (金 jīn), and Earth (土 tǔ). The Year of the Ox follows after the Year of the Rat (the first year of the zodiacal cycle) which happened in 2020 and it then is followed by the Year of the Tiger which happened in 2022.

===Differences with Western astrology===
The term &quot;zodiac&quot; reflects similarities and differences with the Western zodiac. Both similarly have cycles divided into twelve parts, with at least the majority of those parts named for animals, and each is widely associated with an ascription of a person&#x27;s personality or events in their life to a supposed influence of the person&#x27;s particular relationship to the cycle. A major difference between the two is that the animals of the Chinese zodiac are not associated with constellations spanned by the ecliptic plane (that is, the part of the sky through which the Sun appears to move from the perspective of Earth). The Chinese/East Asian 12-part cycle corresponds to years, rather than months.

==Mythological ox==
The ox of the Chinese zodiac has a long history. In Chinese mythology, many myths about oxen or ox-like entities include celestial and earthly beings. The myths range from ones which include oxen or composite beings with ox characteristics as major actors to ones which focus on human or divine actors, in which the role of the oxen are more subsidiary. In some cases, Chinese myths focus on oxen-related subjects, such as plowing and agriculture or ox-powered carriage. Another important role for beef cattle is in the religious capacity of sacrificial offerings. Chinese mythology intersects with the idea of the zodiacal ox.

===Great race===
According to some old mythological traditions there was a race held by a great deity to determine which creatures, in which order, would be the namesakes of the twelve-year cycle. The race was run, and swum, the finishing line being across a great river. The Rat and the Ox crossed easily enough, the Ox due to being large, powerful, and adept both on land and in water: the Rat asked the good-natured Ox for a ride on its back, but then ungratefully jumped off at the last minute to cross the finish line first.

==Years and the Five Elements==

People born within these date ranges can be said to have been born in the &quot;Year of the Ox&quot;, while bearing the following elemental phase sign:
==Lunar Mansion==
In traditional Chinese astrology as well as traditional Chinese astronomy the sky was mapped into various asterisms or what are sometimes referred to as Chinese constellations. This is actually more similar to the zodiac of Western astrology than is the 12 animal cycle. The stars along the plane of the ecliptic divide into groups known as the Twenty-Eight Mansions. Because the moon during its monthly cycle could be observed to appear to move from one mansion (or &quot;camp&quot;) into the next each night in turn, they are also known as Lunar Mansions. Traditionally, these mansions were divided into four groups of seven each, and associated with one of four spiritual entities. This is applicable to the Year of the Ox, Chǒu (丑), a sign linked to the celestial region of the Black Warrior, or Xuánwǔ, linked to the stars of Beta Tauri, in modern astronomy.

==Hour of the Ox==
Main Chinese tradition divided the hours of a day-night period into 12 double-hours. Each of these double-hours corresponds with one of the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac, with similar symbolic motif and astrological significance. The first of the twelve double hours is midnight (at the middle of the double-hour), corresponding with 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.: this is the Hour of the Rat. The second and next double-hour is the Hour of the Ox: 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.; that is the double-hour &quot;chǒu&quot; ().

==Basic astrology elements==
==Around the world==
In the Vietnamese zodiac, the water buffalo occupies the position of the Ox. In Nepal, the Tamu/Gurung people celebrate the year of the cow.

<text>The Rat or Mouse () is the first of the repeating 12-year cycle of animals which appear in the Chinese zodiac, constituting part of the Chinese calendar system (with similar systems in use elsewhere). The Year of the Rat in standard Chinese is . The rat is associated with the first branch of the Earthly Branch symbol (&quot;zǐ&quot;), which starts a repeating cycle of twelve years. The Chinese word &quot;shǔ&quot; () refers to various small rodents (Muroidea), such as rats and mice. The term &quot;&quot; ultimately derives from an Ancient Greek term referring to a &quot;circle of little animals&quot;. There are also a yearly month of the rat and a daily hour of the rat (Chinese double hour, midnight, 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.). Years of the rat are cyclically differentiated by correlation to the Heavenly Stems cycle, resulting in a repeating cycle of five years of the rat (over a sixty-year period), each rat year also being associated with one of the Chinese wu xing, also known as the &quot;five elements&quot;, or &quot;phases&quot;: the &quot;Five Phases&quot; being Fire ( &quot;huǒ&quot;), Water ( &quot;shuǐ&quot;), Wood ( &quot;mù&quot;), Metal ( &quot;jīn&quot;), and Earth ( &quot;tǔ&quot;).

==First Year of the Rat==
In Chinese tradition, the first year was the equivalent of 2637 BCE (although others give other dates). The Prime Minister of the first emperor, Huangdi (also known as the Yellow Emperor), is said in this year to have worked out the sixty-year zodiacal cycle. Part of this achievement was the discovery and incorporation of the nineteen-year so-called Metonic cycle which correlates lunar and solar dates, as part of the system (using leap months).

==Years and the Five Elements==

People born within these date ranges can be said to have been born in the &quot;Year of the Rat&quot;, while bearing the following elemental sign: The following is a chart of the dates of the Gregorian calendar.
==Lunar Mansion==
In traditional Chinese astrology as well as traditional Chinese astronomy the sky was mapped into various asterisms or what are sometimes referred to as Chinese constellations. This is actually more similar to the zodiac of Western astrology than is the 12-animal cycle. The stars along the plane of the ecliptic were divided into groups known as the Twenty-Eight Mansions. Because the moon during its monthly cycle could be observed to appear to move from one mansion (or &quot;camp&quot;) into the next each night in turn, they are also known as Lunar Mansions. Traditionally, these mansions were divided into four groups of seven each, and associated with one of four spiritual entities. The rat is generally associated with the celestial region of the Mystical Warrior, or Xuánwǔ (玄武), and specifically with the mansion Xū (虛), which in turn is associated with the direction North and the darkest part of the winter season, in the northern hemisphere. (Xū (虛) is more-or-less equivalent to Beta Aquarii, also known as Sadalsuud).

==Hour of the Rat==
In old Chinese tradition, the hours of a day-night period were divided into 12 double-hours, each corresponding to one of the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac, with similar symbolic motif and astrological significance. The first of the twelve double hours encompasses midnight, at the middle of the double hour, corresponding with 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., with midnight being the midpoint of the first double-hour, which is the Hour of the Rat, or the hour &quot;zǐ&quot; ().

==Popular culture==
In popular culture, the zodiacal idea of year of the rat is associated with various beliefs about prognostications for the upcoming year, lucky numbers, lucky colors, auspicious romantic connections, similarities between persons born in those years, correlations between Chinese astrology and Western astrology and the like. Traditional Chinese astrology and horoscope has paid much more attention to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches than to the zoology or symbolism of the 12 animals; rather the reference to the animals was more of a way of horology, keeping track of time. Nevertheless, modern times have shown an increased interest in the zodiacal animals, with a great deal of popular interest, in various places of the world. In any case, the rat has long been associated with keen and quick intelligence.

==Basic astrology elements==
==The Jade Emperor and the race for zodiacal place==
A popular modern story has it that the order of the animals in the twelve-year cycle was due to a competition between animal candidates, held by the ruler of Heaven, Earth, and Hell — the Jade Emperor. According to one version of this tale, the emperor&#x27;s advisors selected twelve candidates from among the animal types, including the rat and the cat. The winner was to be selected based upon merit, as to personal appearance, lifestyle, and contributions to the world. Before the competition, the cat asked the rat for a wake up call in order to get to the show on time; however, the rat apprehensive of the competition, especially as to the cat&#x27;s apparent beauty, did not wake the cat, who then overslept (and, ever afterwards, the embittered cat became a ratter and a mouser). The Jade Emperor, mystified as to why only eleven candidate animals showed up, inquired of his servants. These servants hastily acquired the first possible replacement animal which they encountered, (a pig). After the start of the competition, the rat achieved first place by performing on the flute while upon the back of the ox. Impressed, the Jade Emperor placed the rat at the beginning of the twelve-year cycle (and the ox second, for being so generous as to allow the rat to play the flute upon the ox&#x27;s back). Then the other animals were placed in order according to the Jade Emperor&#x27;s judgment.

==The zodiacal rat around the world==

The zodiacal rat is known in other cultures besides China, in Asia and beyond. Generally, the rat/mouse is the first of a twelve-year animal cycle, although some of the other animals tend to vary. In Japan, the rat is known as &quot;nezumi&quot;, and is the first in a twelve-year zodiacal cycle of animals. The Year of the Rat and the years of the subsequent other zodiacal animals is celebrated during Chinese New Year, in many parts of the world, with the animal appropriate to each new year serving as an artistic motif for decorations. The Rat and other zodiacal animals are also a popular motif on Chinese lunar coins and other coin series minted by various countries and also on various internationally issued postage stamps.

In English, Rat Years are sometimes referred to as Mouse Years instead, although in Chinese there is no distinction between the terms.

<doc id="277043" wikidata="Q5179904" url="?curid=277043" title="W. S. Cox Plate">
<text>The W. S. Cox Plate is a Group 1 Thoroughbred horse race for horses aged three years old and over under Weight for age conditions, over a distance of 2040 metres (approximately 1m 2f), that is held by the Moonee Valley Racing Club at Moonee Valley Racecourse, Melbourne, Australia in late October. The race has a purse of A$5,000,000.

==History==
The race is named in honour of William Samuel (W. S.) Cox, the racing club&#x27;s founder.

It was first run on Saturday 28 October 1922 with a purse of £1,000.

Between 1999–2005 the event was included in the Emirates World Series Racing Championship, a global &quot;grand prix&quot; of horse racing. The series included the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, the Japan Cup, the Dubai World Cup, the Arlington Million, the Hong Kong Cup, the Canadian International Stakes, the Grosser Preis von Baden, the Irish Champion Stakes, the Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf and the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic.

==1938 and 1948 racebooks==
==Notable winners==
Past winners of the Cox Plate include many of the champion racehorses of Australia and New Zealand. Winx has been the most successful, winning four years in a row (2015–2018) and Kingston Town won the race three times. Many horses have won the race twice, including Phar Lap, Flight, Tobin Bronze, Sunline, Northerly, Fields of Omagh, and So You Think.

Only one horse has ever won the race in the same year as winning the Melbourne and Caulfield cups, Rising Fast (1954), considered by many to be the greatest-ever horse from New Zealand. One other horse, Might &amp; Power, has won all 3 races but the Cox Plate win was in the next year.

The double with the Melbourne Cup has only been achieved by seven horses: Makybe Diva, Might and Power, Saintly, Nightmarch, Phar Lap, Delta and Rising Fast.

Only three horses have ever won the Melbourne Cup and then gone on to win the Cox Plate the following year: Phar Lap, Might and Power and Makybe Diva.

The first Cox Plate was run in 1922 and won by the English horse Violoncello, who also won his next three starts during the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival.

The 1925 race was taken out by three-year-old Manfred, who went on to win the VRC Derby and ran second to Windbag in the Melbourne Cup.

The class gallopers Heroic (21 wins from 51 races) and Amounis (33 wins from 78 races) were successful in 1926 and 1927.

Champion New Zealand-bred Nightmarch won in 1929 before Phar Lap took out the race in 1930 and 1931. Another dual winner of the race was Chatham in 1932 and 1934, as was Young Idea in 1936 and 1937.

The 1938 race was won by Ajax (36 wins from 46 races) in race record time. Outstanding New Zealand champion Beau Vite, a winner of 31 races, won in 1940 and 1941.

Due to restrictions on interstate travel due to World War II, the race was only contested by local horses from 1942 to 1944.

In 1946, the Cox Plate was run in two divisions with the mare Flight winning the stronger division. She became a dual winner following her victory a year earlier. Hydrogen became the seventh dual winner of the race with victories in 1952 and 1953. The dual Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup winner Rising Fast won in 1954. Redcraze, a 32-race winner and New Zealand champion, took out the Plate in 1957 as a seven-year-old, ridden by George Moore. Noholme took nearly a second off the race record in a front-running display to win in 1959.

Tulloch, who is often compared to Phar Lap and Carbine, won the following year and again set a new race record. Tobin Bronze became a dual winner of the race with victories in 1966 and 1967. The 1969 Cox Plate was won by the New Zealand three-year-old colt Daryl&#x27;s Joy, who went on to race successfully in the USA. The popular Goondiwindi grey, Gunsynd, was trainer Tommy Smith&#x27;s third winner of the Cox Plate in 1972, and the New Zealand Derby winner Fury&#x27;s Order staggered to victory on a bog track in 1975. Surround became the first three-year-old filly to win the race in 1976, when she defeated the VRC Derby winner Unaware.

The ill-fated Dulcify strode away to win by seven lengths in 1979. He later started favourite in the Melbourne Cup but was put down after breaking a pelvis during the race. One of only two triple winners of the Cox Plate, Kingston Town, won in 1980, 1981 and 1982. On each occasion he was ridden by a different jockey: Malcolm Johnston in 1980, Ron Quinton in 1981, and Peter Cook in 1982. After winning in 1983, Strawberry Road raced in Europe and the US, where he ran fifth in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp and third to Seattle Song in the 1984 Washington, D.C. International at Laurel. In 1984, Red Anchor became trainer T.J. Smith&#x27;s seventh Cox Plate winner. The 1986 Cox Plate was a two-horse war over the final 800 metres before Bonecrusher triumphed over Our Waverley Star by a neck. This encounter became known as the Race of the Century.

Rubiton, the winner in 1987, went on to a successful stud career where he sired a future Cox Plate winner in Fields of Omagh. Better Loosen Up was 30 lengths from the lead, with 1000 metres to run, before winning the 1990 Plate in record time. He later became the first – and remains the only – Australian horse to win the Japan Cup. The eight-year-old Super Impose won in 1992 and defeated a top-class field which included Better Loosen Up, Let&#x27;s Elope and favourite Naturalism, who lost his rider. Naturalism went on to run second in the Japan Cup. Australian Horse of the Year Octagonal defeated Mahogany in 1995, while Saintly gave Bart Cummings his second winner of the race in 1996 and Dane Ripper his third winner the following year. The &#x27;People&#x27;s Champion&#x27; Might and Power led throughout to win in 1998, setting a new track record not to be broken for 17 years.

In a front-running display, Sunline won the 1999 Cox Plate and returned in 2000 to win again by seven lengths (equalling Dulcify&#x27;s winning margin), before West Australian champion Northerly defeated her in 2001 and 2002. In 2004, Savabeel became the first 3-year-old to win since Octagonal. In 2005, Makybe Diva triumphed and became one of the most popular horses in Australian racing history with an unprecedented third Melbourne Cup win 10 days later.

Fields of Omagh won his second Cox Plate in 2006, having already won in 2003, then finished second in 2004 and third behind Makybe Diva in 2005. In 2007, El Segundo won the Cox Plate, avenging his close defeat to Fields of Omagh the year before. In 2008, Maldivian led all the way to claim victory, while So You Think, at just his fifth career start, was an easy winner in 2009, giving Bart Cummings his fourth training victory in the race.

In 2013, Shamus Award recorded his first career win in the Cox Plate, a unique achievement for a WFA race of such high standing. He gained a start only due to the scratching of dominant favourite Atlantic Jewel.

Winx won in 2015 as a 4-year-old mare and in doing so set a new track record. She returned in 2016 when the race boasted a stellar field including the high class Godolphin star Hartnell. Winx and Hartnell looked set for a dream showdown approaching the home bend before Hugh Bowman flicked the switch on Winx, who accelerated away to score by a record breaking margin of eight lengths. In 2017, the champion mare started the Cox Plate as the shortest priced favourite since Phar Lap at $1.10 aiming for her 22nd successive win. After receiving a scare down the straight in the final 200m from Humidor, Winx pulled off an incredible victory to join Kingston Town in becoming just the second triple winner of the title. Winx completed the course in a time of 2 min 2.94 and in doing so broke the track record she previously set in 2015. In 2018 Winx launched herself into true equine legend status winning an unprecedented fourth Cox Plate.

<text>Martinho da Costa Lopes (11 November 1918 – 27 February 1991) was an East Timorese religious and political leader. He was a priest of the Catholic Church, the highest-ranking official of the Church in East Timor from 1977 to 1983, and a member of the National Assembly in Lisbon.

== Biography ==
Martinho da Costa Lopes was born on 11 November 1918 in the Manatuto district of Portuguese Timor. He in an era when the Portuguese church, in what was then Portuguese Timor, cooperated closely with the Portuguese colonial government. He attended the Minor Seminary of Nossa Senhora de Fátima in Soibada from 1935 to 1938 and then spent two years at the minor seminary in Macau and six years at the major seminary there. He returned to East Timor in September 1946 to teach at Colégio de S. Francisco Xavier and Colégio-Liceu Dr. Francisco Machado. He was ordained a priest on 18 April 1948. He then took up pastoral assignments in Bobonaro.

By 1975 he was vicar general of Diocese of Dili, the principal assistant of the bishop, José Joaquim Ribeiro. The two of them joined in opposition to the Indonesian invasion of December 1975 and Ribeiro showed courage in communicating his views to foreign reporters, but he found himself close to nervous collapse by late 1977. 

He also knew that the post-colonial world offered no role for a European-born bishop like himself. His request to be allowed to retire was granted by Pope Paul VI on 22 October 1977. Lopes at the age of 58 was named apostolic administrator of the diocese, the highest-ranking Church official in Portuguese Timor, heading the region&#x27;s only diocese though not given the rank of bishop. The Diocese of Díli had once been part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy that mirrored that of Portugal&#x27;s colonies, but on 1 January 1976 had been given exempt status, making it directly subject to the pope. Some 25-30% of the population of East Timor was Catholic in 1975, but the Vatican and its nuncio to Indonesia were equally concerned for the Catholics who formed a far smaller percentage of the population of Muslim-majority Indonesia.

Over the next several years, &quot;he was an outspoken critic of human rights violations in his native East Timor. His calls for intervention by the United Nations or for curtailment of United States military aid to the Indonesian Government went unheeded.&quot;

In 1981, the country&#x27;s lingua franca, the Tetum language, was made an official language of the Catholic liturgy in East Timor in place of Indonesian.

He initially raised allegations of atrocities and starvation with the Indonesian military in private without success. Beginning in 1981, he waged a public campaign by writing letters to overseas contacts and allowing them to be published in newspapers. In particular, he criticised the forced conscription of 50,000 men and boys to form a human chain to help crush the Fretilin resistance, and he denounced the Indonesian army for the massacre of 500 women and children at the Shrine of St Anthony at Lacluta in September 1981.

He was reprimanded by the military and infuriated President Suharto. Never before had an East Timorese so publicly exposed and humiliated the Indonesian Armed Forces. His response was: &quot;I feel the irrepressible need to tell the whole world about the genocide being practised in Timor so that, when we die, at least the world will know we died standing.&quot;

Meanwhile, he continued to highlight the evidence of massive starvation in the resettlement camps and gave his support to his priests who sought to stand alongside the people. He sought a private audience with the pope without success. 

In a letter to Australia, he accused the Indonesian military of mass murder, and anticipated widespread famine unless large food supplies were urgently imported. His predictions were proved correct.

After Lopes wrote to Australian officials in late 1981 to warn of an impending famine, Gough Whitlam, former Australian prime minister, a longtime advocate of Indonesian control of East Timor, visited East Timor in March 1982, met with Lopes, and disputed his claims.

== Retirement and death ==
Government officials complained to the Vatican that Lopes&#x27; sermons were &quot;inciting nationalist sentiment&quot;. A 2006 report of the Australian government said that former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam played an &quot;instrumental&quot; role in the campaign for Lopes&#x27; removal as well. Pope John Paul removed Lopes as administrator in May 1983. 

Since he was not a bishop, he served at the sufferance of the pope and had no recourse. Many Timorese clergy wrote to the Vatican to protest his removal. He continued to campaign on behalf of the Timorese, mobilizing support worldwide on the basis of universal human rights to counterbalance the anticolonial rhetoric of guerillas resisting the Indonesian. He settled in Alges, Portugal. He died in a Lisbon hospital on 27 February 1991.

His name remains associated with a historic re-orientation of the Timorese church towards local culture. During the years he led the diocese, the Church, re-oriented from a Portuguese colonial viewpoint to the service of the indigenous population, grew in numbers not seen during centuries of Portuguese missionary activity.

Lopes was succeeded as Apostolic Administrator by Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo in 1988.

<text>The Mendip Hills (commonly called the Mendips) is a range of limestone hills to the south of Bristol and Bath in Somerset, England. Running from Weston-super-Mare and the Bristol Channel in the west to the Frome valley in the east, the hills overlook the Somerset Levels to the south and the Chew Valley and other tributaries of the Avon to the north. The highest point, at above sea level, is Beacon Batch which is the summit area atop Black Down. The hills gave their name to the former local government district of Mendip, which administered most of the local area until April 2023. The higher, western part of the hills, covering has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), which gives it a level of protection comparable to a national park.

The hills are largely formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland which can be found across the Mendip Hills provide nationally important semi-natural habitats. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (&quot;Draba muralis&quot;).

Mendip has seen human activity since Palaeolithic and Mesolithic times with a range of artefacts being recovered from caves. Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features such as barrows are numerous with over 200 scheduled ancient monuments recorded. There is evidence of mining in the Mendips dating back to the late Bronze Age, which increased after the Roman invasion, particularly for lead and silver around Charterhouse. The difficult conditions in the area were noted by William Wilberforce in 1789, which inspired Hannah More to begin her work improving the conditions of the Mendip miners and agricultural workers. In the 18th and early 19th centuries of the common heathland on the hills were enclosed. In World War II a bombing decoy was constructed on top of Black Down at Beacon Batch. More recently, the mast of the Mendip transmitting station, micro-hydroelectric turbines and a wind turbine have been installed.

There are several quarries on the Mendip Hills. Some of the stone is still carried by Mendip Rail; the other railways in the area closed in the 1960s. Although the Roman Fosse Way crossed the hills, the main roads generally avoid the higher areas and run along the bottom of the scarp slope on the north and south of the hills. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39. A wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities take place in the Mendips, many based on the particular geology of the area. The hills are recognised as a national centre for caving and cave diving, as well as being popular with climbers, hillwalkers and natural historians. Wookey Hole Caves and some of the caves in Cheddar Gorge are open as show caves; however, many of the caves of the Mendip Hills are only accessible to members of caving clubs. Long-distance footpaths include the Mendip Way and Limestone Link.

== Toponymy ==
There has been a great deal of debate, over the course of decades if not centuries, about the provenance and meaning of the toponym &#x27;Mendip&#x27;, and as late as 2000, two leading place-name scholars felt able to remark that &quot;Mendip is probably best regarded as unsolved&quot;. However, an idea put forward in a 1986 paper, by one of the UK&#x27;s leading academic place-name researchers, seems to have regrettably fallen beneath the radar, and has not had the widespread currency that it deserves. The author of the article was Richard Coates, now Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at the University of the West of England. Following a review of earlier evidence, Prof. Coates suggested that Mendip is a hybrid name, part British and part Old English. He posits a first element &quot;mönïð&quot;, from Primitive Welsh, meaning &#x27;a hill&#x27;, and Old English &quot;yppe,&quot; &#x27;a hunting dais&#x27;. The strong sense of the word in its entirety is &#x27;an upland area used for hunting&#x27;. The logic and elegance of this explanation is extremely clear - the Mendip plateau had been used explicitly as a hunting ground by the Anglo-Saxon kings, something strikingly reinforced by the (possibly apocryphal) story of King Edmund, in the middle of the 10th century, escaping death by a whisker as the stag he was chasing plunged to its death over Cheddar Gorge, his own horse only pulling up short at the last minute on the very lip of the cliff. The Normans placed Mendip under Forest Law for the same reason. 

== Geology ==
The rock strata known as the Carboniferous Limestone were laid down during the early Carboniferous Period, about 320–350 million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe underwent continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic Era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny near the end of the Carboniferous, 300 million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe.

As a result of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east–west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300 million years ago, and subsequent erosion has resulted in varying geological features including gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of karst landscapes. Beneath the southern escarpment and plateau are caves. There are also areas of limestone pavement and other karst features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.

Black Down is a moorland area, with its steeper slopes covered in bracken (&quot;Pteridium&quot;) and its flatter summit in heather (&quot;Calluna&quot;) and grasses rather than the pasture which covers much of the plateau. The main body of the range is an extended plateau, 6–8 km (4–5 miles) wide and generally about 240 metres (800 ft) above sea level.

In some places lead and zinc ores have mineralised the limestone and the dolomitic conglomerate. From the time of Roman Britain until 1908, the hills were an important source of lead. These areas were the centre of a major mining industry in the past and this is reflected in areas of contaminated rough ground known locally as &quot;gruffy&quot;. The word &quot;gruffy&quot; is thought to derive from the grooves that were formed where the lead ore was extracted from veins near the surface. Other commodities obtained included calamine (zinc ore), manganese, iron, copper and baryte. The eastern area reaches into parts of the Somerset Coalfield.

North and east of the Mendips the Carboniferous Limestone layers are found in the subsurface and are exposed in Avon Gorge, and are overlain by younger strata in Dundry Hill and the Cotswolds, where oolitic limestone of Jurassic age is found at the surface. West of the main Mendip plateau the Carboniferous Limestone continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm in the Bristol Channel.

The hills gave their name to the rare mineral mendipite, an oxohalide of lead with chlorine with formula Pb3Cl2O2 which was first described in the area. A sample of mendipite was found at the head of Ebbor Gorge.

== Climate ==
Along with the rest of South West England, the Mendip Hills have a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 °C (50 °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between 1 °C (34 °F) and 2 °C (36 °F). July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around 21 °C (70 °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.

Cumulus cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900 mm (31–35 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest; the prevailing wind direction is from the south-west.

A combination of the rainfall and geology leads to an estimated average daily runoff from springs and boreholes of some 330,000 m3 (72 million imperial gallons). Bristol Waterworks Company (now Bristol Water) recognised the value of this resource and between 1846 and 1853 created a series of tunnels, pipes, and aqueducts called the &quot;Line of Works&quot;, which still carry approximately 18,200 m3 (4 million imperial gallons) of water a day to Barrow Gurney Reservoirs for filtration and then on to Bristol and the surrounding areas. This collection and conveyance of water from the Chewton Mendip and East and West Harptree areas is accomplished by the effect of gravity on the runoff. Water from the Mendips is also collected in Cheddar Reservoir, which was constructed in the 1930s and takes water from the springs in Cheddar Gorge.

== Ecology ==

The area hosts three semi-natural habitats of national importance: ash–maple woodland (&quot;Fraxinus&quot; spp. and &quot;Acer&quot; spp.) often with abundant small-leaved lime (&quot;Tilia cordata&quot;), calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland.

Much of the Mendips is open calcareous grassland, supporting a wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World War I. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits, sheep and cattle maintains the grassland habitat.

Of the many bird species found in the Mendips, the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), which has gradually recolonised the area since the 1980s, is particularly significant. It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and on the faces of active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance due to colonisation by the Dartford warbler (&quot;Sylvia undata&quot;), which can be found at Black Down and Crook Peak. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. The woodlands at Stock Hill are a breeding site for nightjars (&quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;) and long-eared owls (&quot;Asio otus&quot;). The Waldegrave Pool, part of Priddy Mineries, is an important site for dragonflies, including downy emerald (&quot;Cordulia aenea&quot;) and four-spotted chaser (&quot;Libellula quadrimaculata&quot;). Waldegrave Pool is the only Mendip breeding site for downy emerald dragonflies. In 2007 the first confirmed sighting of a red kite (&quot;Milvus milvus&quot;) on the Mendips was made at Charterhouse.

A range of important small mammals are found in the area, including the hazel dormouse (&quot;Muscardinus avellanarius&quot;) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (&quot;Rhinolophus hipposideros&quot;) and greater horseshoe bats (&quot;Rhinolophus ferrumequinum&quot;), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (&quot;Triturus cristatus&quot;) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.

Several rare butterflies are indigenous to the area, including the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (&quot;Boloria euphrosyne&quot;), Duke of Burgundy (&quot;Hamearis lucina&quot;), and white-letter hairstreak (&quot;Satyrium w-album&quot;). The large blue butterfly (&quot;Maculinea arion&quot;) became extinct in the hills in the late 1970s. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in a tributary of the Mells River and the River Chew.

The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are a well-known feature of the Mendips. Constructed from local limestone in an &quot;A frame&quot; design, the walls are strong yet contain no mortar; many have been neglected and allowed to disintegrate, or have been replaced or contained by a mix of barbed wire and sheep fencing. These dry-stone walls are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (&quot;Draba muralis&quot;). Amongst the plants which occur in the area are the Cheddar pink (&quot;Dianthus gratianopolitanus&quot;), purple gromwell (&quot;Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum&quot;), white rock-rose (&quot;Helianthemum apenninum&quot;), Somerset hair-grass (&quot;Koeleria vallesiana&quot;), and starved wood-sedge (&quot;Carex depauperata&quot;).

== History ==
Twenty Palaeolithic sites have been identified in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic artefacts recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the artefacts found include points, scrapers, and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of artefacts have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed artefacts and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain&#x27;s oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough&#x27;s Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.

Within the Mendip Hills AONB, good evidence exists for 286 definite examples of round barrows, including the Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. The Historic England Archive holds over 1,200 entries for the area, and there are over 600 listed buildings, in addition to over 200 scheduled ancient monuments. These protected monuments range from prehistoric barrows and hillforts to the Black Down bombing decoy from the Second World War.

Settlement on the Mendip Hills appears to fall into two types. The first, apparent in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated on a small scale in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.

There is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, when there were technological changes in metal-working indicating the use of lead. The Roman invasion, and possibly the preceding period of involvement in the internal affairs of the south of England, was inspired, in part, by the mineral wealth of the Mendips.

William Wilberforce&#x27;s visit to Cheddar in 1789, during which he saw the poor circumstances of the locals, inspired Hannah More to begin her work improving the conditions of the Mendip miners and agricultural workers. Under her influence, schools were built and children were formally instructed in reading and Christian doctrine. Between 1770 and 1813 some of land on the hills were enclosed, mainly with dry stone walls that today form a key part of the landscape. In 2006 funding was obtained to maintain and improve the walls, which had steadily deteriorated over the years.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
In World War II, a bombing decoy was constructed on top of Black Down at Beacon Batch in an attempt to confuse bombers aiming to damage the city of Bristol, and piles of stones (known as cairns) were created to prevent enemy aircraft using the hilltop as a landing site.

In the 1960s, the tallest mast in the region at above ground level, the Mendip UHF television transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill near Wells, one of the highest points of the Mendips. The transmitter&#x27;s antenna rises to almost above sea level.

Since 2003, arguments have raged over plans to erect a wind turbine near Chewton Mendip. The proposal was initially rejected by Mendip District Council, with the support of a range of local groups and organisations, on the grounds that the environmental impact on the edge of the AONB outweighed the amount of electricity which would be generated. In April 2006, however, a planning enquiry gave Ecotricity permission to build a 102 m (335 ft) turbine during the following year.

== AONB status ==

The western end of the Mendip Hills has, since 1972, been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Mendip Society, which was formed in 1965, helps to raise awareness of this designation and protect the area. The society runs a programme of guided walks and educational presentations. The society also has a small grants fund to assist communities with the conservation and enhancement of the landscape and to encourage its enjoyment and celebration.

As their landscapes have similar scenic qualities, AONBs may be compared to the national parks of England and Wales. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

The Mendip Hills Partnership, which performs an administrative role, includes the five local authorities that cover the AONB, statutory bodies such as Natural England, together with parish councils and other organisations and groups that have an interest in the conservation and care of the area. The Mendip Hills AONB staff unit of the partnership is based at the Charterhouse Centre in the heart of the AONB. The AONB Unit consists of four staff: a manager, project officer, support officer and part-time planning officer and fixed term project officers. They are supported by volunteer rangers. In 2005 a proposal was submitted to the Countryside Agency to extend the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to Steep Holm and Brean Down in the west and towards Frome in the east.

Many of the villages on the Mendips have their own parish councils, which have some responsibility for local issues. Local people also elect councillors to district councils or to unitary authorities. The of the AONB are split across four districts: Mendip District Council ,
Sedgemoor District Council ,
Bath and North East Somerset Council , and
North Somerset Council .

== Demographics ==
The population on the higher plateau is widely dispersed in small farms and hamlets, although rather than working in agriculture or forestry, most people now commute to employment in surrounding cities and towns. The largest village on the plateau on the western Mendips is Priddy, which had a population of 624 at the 2011 census along with the smaller hamlet of Charterhouse. The larger villages and towns are on the lower slopes of the western hills, often in river valleys. Axbridge, with a population of 2,057, and Cheddar (5,755), both within the Sedgemoor district, together with the Mendip town of Shepton Mallet (10,369) and the city of Wells (10,636) are along the southern border of the hills. The North Somerset parishes of Blagdon (1,116), and the parishes of Compton Martin (508), East Harptree (644) and West Harptree (439), lie along the northern edge.

Further east are the towns of Midsomer Norton and Radstock and the village of Paulton (population 5,302) within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset.

== Transport and communications ==

In the middle of the 1st century, ancient tracks across the hills were superseded by the Roman Fosse Way, from Bath to Ilchester, a branch of which served the Charterhouse lead mines. Stratton-on-the-Fosse and Lydford-on-Fosse, two villages of the Mendips, reflect the arrival of this new road. Much of the high plateau, however, remained uncultivated and unenclosed until the 18th century, resulting in many roads remaining as narrow winding lanes between high banks and hedges or stone walls. Where the tracks had their origins as drovers roads, they typically become open roads with wide verges. The roads tend to follow the line of gorges and valleys, as at Cheddar Gorge.

The more major of the current roads often started as turnpikes in the 16th century. These avoid the highest areas of the hills. To the north of the western part of the Mendips, the A368 separates the hills from the Chew Valley, while on the southern edge the A371 similarly runs along the bottom of the scarp slope between the hills and the Somerset Levels. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway with access at junctions 21 and 22, along with the A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37, A39, A36 and the A361.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Bristol and North Somerset Railway ran roughly parallel to the A37. Further south and west, the Cheddar Valley Line and Wrington Vale Light Railway, branches of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, served towns and villages from Cheddar to Wells. In the east, the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ran south from Bath into Dorset, and also served Wells. These have all now closed, but Mendip Rail has freight lines to carry limestone from the quarries of the Mendip Hills. There is also the East Somerset Railway which is an operational heritage railway. The Somerset Coal Canal reached some of the pits of the Somerset Coalfield in the eastern end of the Mendips.

== Quarrying ==
In recent centuries the Mendips, like the Cotswolds to the north, have been quarried for stone to build the cities of Bath and Bristol, as well as smaller towns in Somerset. The quarries are now major suppliers of road stone to southern England, among them producing around twelve million tonnes of limestone every year, employing over two thousand people, and turning over approximately £150 million per annum.

There are two main rock types on the Mendips: the Devonian sandstones visible around Blackdown and Downhead and the Carboniferous Limestones, which dominate the hills and surround the older rock formations. There are nine active quarries and a host of disused sites, several of which have been designated as geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest by English Nature. Because of the effect quarrying has on the environment and local communities, a campaign has been started to halt the creation of any new quarries and to restrict the activities and expansion of the existing ones.

== Sport, leisure, and tourism ==
The Mendips are home to a wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities, including hunting, caving, climbing, and abseiling. The rich variety of fauna and flora also makes it attractive for hillwalking and those interested in natural history.

=== Mendip Activity Centre ===
Mendip Activity Centre is set in the Mendip Hills and is one of the largest outdoor activity centres in the South West. It is a key part of the local tourism community bringing significant revenue and visitor numbers each year, welcoming 10,000s of visitors. They have a thriving outdoor education program with schools, delivering school residentials. Families and individuals take part in activities including skiing and snowboarding, climbing and abseiling, kayaking and paddle boarding, caving, archery, air rifle, tobogganing and disc golf. Their pop-up campsite, Mendip Basecamp, opened to the public in 2020 and in 2023 was named Gold Campsite at the Bristol, Bath and Somerset Tourism Awards.

=== Caving and cave diving ===
Large areas of limestone on the Mendips have been worn away by water, making the hills a national centre for caving. Some of the caves have been known about since the establishment of the Mendip lead mining industry in Roman times. However, many have been discovered or explored only in the 20th century. Specialist equipment and knowledge is required to visit the vast majority of the caves, but Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole Caves are two show caves which are easily accessible to the public. The active Mendip Caving Group and other local caving organisations organise trips and continue to discover new caverns.

The Hills conceal the largest underground river system in Britain; attempts to move from one cave to another through the underground rivers led to the development of cave diving in Britain. The first cave dive was attempted at Swildon&#x27;s Hole in 1934, and the first successful dive was achieved the following year at Wookey Hole Caves, which has the deepest sump in Britain at 76 m (250 ft). The cave complexes at St. Dunstan&#x27;s Well Catchment, Lamb Leer, and Priddy Caves have been identified as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.
The deepest cave in the Mendip Hills is Charterhouse Cave with a vertical range of .

Many caves in the Mendip area were excavated for archaeological and natural history studies by pioneer explorer Herbert E. Balch and were photographed by the early caver Harry Savory at the start of the 20th century using cameras, glass plates and flash powder.

=== Walking ===

Several sites on the Mendips are designated as open access land, and there are many footpaths and bridleways that are generally clearly marked.

The Limestone Link is a long-distance footpath from the Mendips to the Cotswolds, and the Mendip Way covers from Weston-super-Mare to Frome. The western section runs from the Bristol Channel at Uphill Cliff, affording views over the Somerset Levels, crosses the central Mendip plateau leading down to Cheddar Gorge, and then continues to Wells and Frome. The much longer Monarch&#x27;s Way runs for , from Worcester to Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex. It closely follows the route taken by Charles II after his defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. The route enters Somerset near Chewton Mendip and crosses the Mendip Hills heading for Wells. A shorter local path, the long Mendip Pub Trail, connects six pubs owned by Butcombe Brewery. The trail runs from Hinton Blewett through Priddy, Axbridge, Bleadon, Rowberrow, and Compton Martin.

=== Motor sport ===
Various forms of oval short-track racing, including F1 and F2 stock cars, have taken place at Mendips Raceway since 1969. The track is located on Warrens Hill Road, on the rim of Batts Combe quarry between Shipham and Charterhouse.

== In the arts ==
Thomas Hardy described the Mendips as &quot;a range of limestone rocks stretching from the shores of the Bristol Channel into the middle of Somersetshire&quot;, and several of his books refer to the Mendips or sites on the hills. According to legend, Augustus Montague Toplady was inspired to write the words of the hymn &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; while sheltering under a rock in Burrington Combe during a thunderstorm in 1763; there is a metal plaque marking the site.

<doc id="277051" wikidata="Q657798" url="?curid=277051" title="Mendip District">
<text>Mendip was a local government district of Somerset in England. The district covered a largely rural area of with a population of approximately 112,500, ranging from the Wiltshire border in the east to part of the Somerset Levels in the west. The district took its name from the Mendip Hills. The administrative centre of the district was Shepton Mallet but the largest town was Frome.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 by a merger of the municipal boroughs of Glastonbury and Wells, along with Frome, Shepton Mallet, and Street urban districts, and Frome Rural District, Shepton Mallet Rural District, Wells Rural District, part of Axbridge Rural District and part of Clutton Rural District.

On 1 April 2023, the district was abolished and became part of Somerset Council, a unitary authority.

==Toponymy==
Several explanations for the name &quot;Mendip&quot; have been suggested. Its earliest known form is &quot;Mendepe&quot; in 1185. One suggestion is that it is derived from the medieval term &#x27;. However, A D Mills derives its meaning from Celtic &#x27;, meaning mountain or hill, with an uncertain second element, perhaps Old English &quot;&quot; in the sense of upland, or plateau.

An alternative explanation is that the name is cognate with &quot;Mened&quot; (Welsh &#x27;), a Brythonic term for upland moorland. The suffix may be a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;, meaning a valley. Possible further meanings have been identified. The first is &#x27;the stone pit&#x27; from the Celtic &#x27; and &#x27; in reference to the collapsed cave systems of Cheddar. The second is &#x27;Mighty and Awesome&#x27; from the Old English &#x27; and &#x27;.

==Governance==

Until 2023, Mendip district fell under the jurisdiction of Mendip District Council. At the 2019 local elections, no party gained overall control.
As of March 2022, the council had 23 Liberal Democrats, 12 Conservatives, 10 Greens, and 2 Independents.

===Abolition===
On 1 April 2023, the council was abolished and replaced by Somerset Council, a unitary authority for the area previously served by Somerset County Council. Elections for the new council took place in May 2022, and it ran alongside Mendip and the other councils until their abolition in April 2023.

==Settlements==

The five main settlements of the former Mendip council were Frome, Glastonbury, Shepton Mallet, Street and Wells. Frome, Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet were the only towns in the district, with Wells having city status and Street maintaining its status as a village despite a population in excess of 11,000.

<text>The Caulfield Cup is a Melbourne Racing Club Group 1 Thoroughbred horse race held under handicap conditions. 
This is for all horses aged three years old and older. It takes place over a distance of 2400 metres at the Caulfield Racecourse, Melbourne, Australia in mid October. The prize money is A$5,000,000.

==History==
The race has become one of Australia&#x27;s richest Thoroughbred horse races. The race is held annually on the third Saturday in October, the third day and final day of the Caulfield Carnival. Performances in the Caulfield Cup are one of the possible qualification methods for a run in the Melbourne Cup which is held 17 days later.


During World War II the race was run at Flemington Racecourse and in 1943 the race was run in divisions.

===Race qualification===
The field is limited to 18 starters with four emergency entries which is decided by a ballot system. The prize money, wins and placings in lead up races are among the major factors that determine the eligibility of a horse.
Automatic entry is awarded to winners of the Toorak Handicap, Herbert Power Stakes and the Mornington Cup.

=== Notable runnings ===
* Australian Test cricketer Clem Hill was the handicapper for the Victoria Amateur Turf Club (VATC) and responsible for setting the weights for the Caulfield Cup from 1937 to 1943.
* Jockey Scobie Breasley rode the winner of four consecutive Caulfield Cups from 1942 to 1945. This included a division of the 1943 race, which was run in two divisions. He also holds the record for most wins by a jockey of the race - five wins.
* Trainer Bart Cummings holds the record for training Caulfield Cup winners with seven - Galilee, Big Philou, Leilani, Ming Dynasty (twice), Let&#x27;s Elope and Viewed.
* 2014 Caulfield Cup winner Admire Rakti died after his run in the Melbourne Cup from natural causes.
* Horses trained outside Australia and New Zealand have been participating in the race since 1998. Six have won the race. They are Taufan&#x27;s Melody (1998) for British trainer Lady Herries, All the Good (2008) and Best Solution (2018) for Saeed bin Suroor of the Godolphin stables, Dunaden (2012) for French trainer Mikel Delzangles, Admire Rakti (2014) for Japanese trainer Tomoyuki Umeda and Mer De Glace (2019) for Japanese trainer Hisashi Shimizu.
* The worst race fall in Australian history occurred at the 1885 Caulfield Cup when 15 of the 44 horses competing fell as they turned onto the straight, resulting in the death of 25-year-old jockey Donald Nicolson.
* In 2007, Maldivian and Eskimo Queen were late scratchings. Maldivian, shortest price favourite for 41 years, misbehaved and injured himself in the starting stalls, frightening second priced favourite Eskimo Queen who for a time was trapped beneath the stalls. The race started almost nine minutes late.

<text>Reserve Bank of India, abbreviated as RBI, is the central bank of India, and regulatory body responsible for regulation of the Indian banking system and Indian currency. Owned by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, it is responsible for the control, issue, and maintenance of the supply of the Indian rupee. It also manages the country&#x27;s main payment systems and works to promote its economic development.

The RBI, along with the Indian Banks&#x27; Association, established the National Payments Corporation of India to promote and regulate the payment and settlement systems in India. Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran (BRBNM) is a specialised division of RBI through which it prints and mints Indian currency notes (INR) in two of its currency printing presses located in Mysore (Karnataka; Southern India) and Salboni (West Bengal; Eastern India). Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation was established by RBI as one of its specialized division for the purpose of providing insurance of deposits and guaranteeing of credit facilities to all Indian banks.

Until the Monetary Policy Committee was established in 2016, it also had full control over monetary policy in the country. It commenced its operations on 1 April 1935 in accordance with the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The original share capital was divided into shares of 100 each fully paid. The RBI was nationalised on 1 January 1949, almost a year and a half after India&#x27;s independence.

The overall direction of the RBI lies with the 21-member central board of directors, composed of: the governor; four deputy governors; two finance ministry representatives (usually the Economic Affairs Secretary and the Financial Services Secretary); ten government-nominated directors; and four directors who represent local boards for Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Delhi. Each of these local boards consists of five members who represent regional interests and the interests of co-operative and indigenous banks.

It is a member bank of the Asian Clearing Union. The bank is also active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI). The bank is often referred to by the name &quot;Mint Street&quot;.

== Preamble ==
The preamble of the Reserve Bank of India describes the basic functions of the reserve bank as:

== History==
The Reserve Bank of India was established in 1934, under the Reserve Bank of India Act. Though privately owned initially, it was nationalised in 1949 and since then fully owned by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India (GoI).

=== 1935–1949 ===
The Reserve Bank of India was founded on 1 April 1935 to respond to economic troubles after the First World War. The bank was set up based on the recommendations of the 1926 Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, also known as the Hilton Young Commission. Eventually, the Central Legislative Assembly passed these guidelines as the RBI Act 1934. India was the first colony to have its own central bank.

The original choice for the seal of RBI was the East India Company Double Mohur, with the sketch of the Lion and Palm Tree. However, it was decided to replace the lion with the tiger, the national animal of India. The Preamble of the RBI describes its basic functions to regulate the issue of banknotes, keep reserves to secure monetary stability in India, and generally to operate the currency and credit system in the best interests of the country. The Central Office of the RBI was established in Calcutta (now Kolkata) but was moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1937. The RBI also acted as Burma&#x27;s (now Myanmar) central bank until April 1947 (except during the years of Japanese occupation (1942–45)), even though Burma seceded from the Indian Union in 1937. After the Partition of India in August 1947, the bank served as the central bank for Pakistan until June 1948 when the State Bank of Pakistan commenced operations. Though set up as a shareholders&#x27; bank, the RBI has been fully owned by the Government of India since its nationalisation in 1949. RBI has a monopoly of note issue.

=== 1950–1960 ===
In the 1950s, the Indian government, under its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, developed a centrally planned economic policy that focused on the agricultural sector. The administration nationalised commercial banks and established, based on the &quot;Banking Companies Act, 1949&quot; (later called the Banking Regulation Act), a central bank regulation as part of the RBI. Furthermore, the central bank was ordered to support economic plan with loans.

=== 1961–1968 ===
As a result of bank crashes, the RBI was requested to establish and monitor a deposit insurance system. Meant to restore the trust in the national bank system, it was initialized on 7 December 1961. The Indian government founded the funds to promote the economy and used the slogan &quot;Developing Banking&quot;. The government of India restructured the national bank market and nationalized a lot of institutes. As a result, the RBI had to play the central part in controlling and supporting this public banking sector.

=== 1969–1984 ===
In 1969, the Indira Gandhi-headed government nationalised 14 major commercial banks. Upon Indira Gandhi&#x27;s return to power in 1980, a further six banks were nationalised. The regulation of the economy and especially the financial sector was reinforced by the Government of India in the 1970s and 1980s. The central bank became the central player and increased its policies a lot for various tasks like interests, reserve ratio and visible deposits. These measures aimed at better economic development and had a huge effect on the company policy of the institutes. The banks lend money in selected sectors, like agricultural business and small trade companies. The Banking Commission was established on Wednesday, 29 January 1969, to analyse banking costs, effects of legislations and banking procedures, including non-banking financial intermediaries and indigenous banking on Government of India economy; with R.G. Saraiya as the chairman.

The branch was forced to establish two new offices in the country for every newly established office in a town. The oil crises in 1973 resulted in increasing inflation, and the RBI restricted monetary policy to reduce the effects.

=== 1985–1990 ===
Many committees analysed the Indian economy between 1985 and 1989. Their results had an effect on the RBI. The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research and the Security &amp; Exchange Board of India investigated the national economy as a whole, and the security and exchange board proposed better methods for more effective markets and the protection of investor interests. The Indian financial market was a leading example for so-called &quot;financial repression&quot; (Mckinnon and Shaw). The Discount and Finance House of India began its operations in the monetary market in April 1988; the National Housing Bank, founded in July 1988, was forced to invest in the property market and a new financial law improved the versatility of direct deposit by more security measures and liberalisation.

=== 1991–1999 ===
The national economy contracted in July 1991 as the Indian rupee was devalued. The currency lost 18% of its value relative to the US dollar, and the Narsimham Committee advised restructuring the financial sector by a temporal reduced reserve ratio as well as the statutory liquidity ratio. New guidelines were published in 1993 to establish a private banking sector. This turning point was meant to reinforce the market and was often called neo-liberal. The central bank deregulated bank interests and some sectors of the financial market like the trust and property markets. This first phase was a success and the central government forced a diversity liberalisation to diversify owner structures in 1998.

The National Stock Exchange of India took the trade on in June 1994 and the RBI allowed nationalised banks in July to interact with the capital market to reinforce their capital base. The central bank founded a subsidiary company—the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited—on 3 February 1995 to produce banknotes.

=== 2000 - 2009 ===
The &quot;Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999&quot; came into force in June 2000. It should improve the item in 2004–2005 (National Electronic Fund Transfer). The Security Printing &amp; Minting Corporation of India Ltd., a merger of nine institutions, was founded in 2006 and produces banknotes and coins.

The national economy&#x27;s growth rate came down to 5.8% in the last quarter of 2008–2009 and the central bank promotes the economic development.

=== Since 2010 ===
In 2016, the Government of India amended the RBI Act to establish the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to set. This limited the role of the RBI in setting interest rates, as the MPC membership is evenly divided between members of the RBI (including the RBI governor) and independent members appointed by the government. However, in the event of a tie, the vote of the RBI governor is decisive.

The same year, the RBI started issuing a new bond called the Sovereign Gold Bond, on behalf of the Government. The intent behind the scheme was to reduce gold imports by shifting investments from physical gold into a bond that tracked the price of gold. The bond also carried interest.

In April 2018, the RBI announced that &quot;entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling virtual currencies,&quot; including Bitcoin. While the RBI later clarified that it &quot;has not prohibited&quot; virtual currencies, a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling on 4 March 2020 that the RBI had failed to show &quot;at least some semblance of any damage suffered by its regulated entities&quot; through the handling of virtual currencies to justify its decision. The court challenge was filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India, whose members include some cryptocurrency exchanges whose businesses suffered following the RBI&#x27;s 2018 order.

== Structure ==
The central board of directors is the main committee of the central bank. The Government of India appoints the directors for a four-year term. The board consists of a governor, and not more than four deputy governors; four directors to represent the regional boards; two – usually the Economic Affairs Secretary and the Financial Services Secretary – from the Ministry of Finance and ten other directors from various fields. The Reserve Bank – under Raghuram Rajan&#x27;s governorship – wanted to create a post of a chief operating officer (COO), in the rank of deputy governor and wanted to re-allocate work between the five of them (four deputy governor and COO).

Two of the four deputy governors are traditionally from RBI ranks and are selected from the bank&#x27;s executive directors. One is nominated from among the chairpersons of public sector banks and the other is an economist. An Indian Administrative Service officer can also be appointed as deputy governor of RBI and later as the governor of RBI as with the case of Y. Venugopal Reddy and Duvvuri Subbarao. Other persons forming part of the central board of directors of the RBI are Revathi Iyer, Sachin Chaturvedi, Satish Kashinath Marathe, Swaminathan Gurumurthy, Anand Gopal Mahindra, Venu Srinivasan, Pankaj Ramanbhai Patel, Ravindra H. Dholakia, Ajay Seth, and Vivek Joshi.

Executive Directors (ED) consist of M. Rajeshwar Rao, Lily Vadera, Rabi N. Mishra, Smt. Nanda S. Dave, Anil K. Sharma, S. C. Murmu, T. Rabi Sankar, Janak Raj, P Vijayakumar, Indrani Banerjee, O.P. Mall and Sudha Balakrishnan
(Chief Financial Officer). 

Sudha Balakrishnan, a former vice-president at National Securities Depository Limited, assumed charge as the first chief financial officer (CFO) of the Reserve Bank on 15 May 2018; she was given the rank of an executive director.

The bank&#x27;s current governor is Sanjay Malhotra. There are currently four deputy governors Swaminathan J, M. Rajeshwar Rao, Michael Patra and T. Rabi Shankar.
== Branches and support bodies ==

The RBI has four regional representations: North in New Delhi, South in Chennai, East in Kolkata and West in Mumbai. The representations are formed by five members, appointed for four years by the central government and with the advice of the central board of directors serve as a forum for regional banks and to deal with delegated tasks from the Central Board.

RBI has 31 branches in India. Mostly all are in Capital cities, exceptions are the Nagpur Reserve Bank branch which is actually a Second capital of Maharashtra and the Ahmedabad Reserve Bank branch. Nagpur Reserve Bank was established in 1956, while the Ahmedabad branch was established in 1950.

It has 3 training colleges for its officers, viz. Reserve Bank Staff College Chennai, Reserve Bank of India Academy Mumbai, and Reserve Bank of India College of Agricultural Banking Pune. There are three autonomous institutions run by RBI namely National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM), Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR), Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT). There are also four zonal training centres at Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and New Delhi.

The Board of Financial Supervision (BFS), formed in November 1994, serves as a CCBD committee to control the financial institutions. It has four members, appointed for two years, and takes measures to strength the role of statutory auditors in the financial sector, external monitoring, and internal controlling systems. The Tarapore committee was set up by the Reserve Bank of India under the chairmanship of former RBI deputy governor S. S. Tarapore to &quot;lay the road map&quot; to capital account convertibility. The five-member committee recommended a three-year time frame for complete convertibility by 1999–2000.

On 8 December 2017, Surekha Marandi, executive director (ED) of Reserve Bank of India, said RBI will open an office in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.

== Subsidiaries ==
===Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran===

BRBNM was established by RBI on 3 February 1995 to enable RBI to bridge the gap between maintain, demand and supply of Indian rupee notes in the country.

===Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation===
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation was established by RBI for the purpose of providing insurance of deposits and guaranteeing of credit facilities to all Indian banks.

===Reserve Bank of India Information Technology===

IFTAS has taken over the Indian FInancial NETwork (INFINET), Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) and the Indian Banking Community Cloud (IBCC) from the IDRBT, effective 1 April 2016.

=== Reserve Bank of India Innovation Hub ===
Shaktikanta Das inaugurated the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH) on 24 March 2022 in Bengaluru as Section-8 company under Companies Act, 2013, with an initial investment of ₹100 crore to encourage and nurture financial innovation sustainably through an institutional set-up.

RBIH is working on the blueprint of Digital Rupee. Through the LF Decentralized Trust, the RBI is utilizing Linux Foundation&#x27;s projects to build the Digital Rupee.

== Functions ==


The central bank of any country executes many functions such as overseeing monetary policy, issuing currency, managing foreign exchange, working as a bank for government and as a banker of scheduled commercial banks. It also works for overall economic growth of the country. The purposes for which the RBI has been established as India’s central bank has been spelt out in the preamble to the RBI Act: &quot;i) &quot;to regulate the issue of banknotes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage; and&quot;

&quot;(ii) that it is essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy and the primary objective of the monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth&quot; ...to regulate the issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.&quot;

=== Financial supervision ===
The primary objective of RBI is to undertake consolidated supervision of the financial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions, and non-banking finance companies.

The board is constituted by co-opting four directors from the Central Board as members for a term of two years and is chaired by the governor. The deputy governors of the reserve bank are ex-officio members. One deputy governor, usually the deputy governor in charge of banking regulation and supervision, is nominated as the vice-chairman of the board. The board is required to meet normally once every month. It considers inspection reports and other supervisory issues placed before it by the supervisory departments.

Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) through the Audit Sub-Committee also aims at upgrading the quality of the statutory audit and internal audit functions in banks and financial institutions. The audit sub-committee includes deputy governor as the chairman and two directors of the Central Board as members. The BFS oversees the functioning of the Department of Banking Supervision (DBS), the Department of Non-Banking Supervision (DNBS) and the Financial Institutions Division (FID) and gives directions on the regulatory and supervisory issues.

=== Regulator and supervisor of the financial system ===

As a regulator and supervisor of the Indian banking system it ensures financial stability and public confidence in the banking system. It prescribes broad parameters of banking operations within which the country&#x27;s banking and financial system functions. Its objectives are to maintain public confidence in the system, protect depositors&#x27; interest and provide cost-effective banking services to the public. The Banking Ombudsman Scheme has been formulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for effective addressing of complaints by bank customers. The RBI controls the monetary supply, monitors economic indicators like the gross domestic product and has to decide the design of the rupee banknotes as well as coins. RBI uses methods like on-site inspections, off-site surveillance, scrutiny and periodic meetings to supervise new bank licences, setting capital requirements and regulating interest rates in specific areas. RBI is currently focused on implementing norms.

=== Regulator and supervisor of the payment and settlement systems ===
Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 (PSS Act) gives the Reserve Bank oversight authority, including regulation and supervision, for the payment and settlement systems in the country. In this role, the RBI focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure and efficient payment and settlement mechanisms. Two payment systems National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) allow individuals, companies and firms to transfer funds from one bank to another. These facilities can only be used for transferring money within the country.

From 16 December 2019, one can transfer money online using the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) route 24x7, i.e., any time of the day and any day of the week. The Reserve Bank of India stated earlier in December 2019 that bank customers will be able to transfer funds through NEFT around the clock on all days including weekends and holidays from 16 December. In RTGS, transactions are processed continuously 24x7.

=== Banker and debt manager to government ===
Just as individuals need a bank to carry out their financial transactions effectively and efficiently, governments also need a bank to carry out their financial transactions. The RBI serves this purpose for the Government of India (GoI). The RBI is also a banker to the government and performs merchant banking function for the central and the state governments. As a banker to the Government of India, the RBI maintains its accounts, receive payments into and make payments out of these accounts. The RBI also helps the GoI to raise money from the public via issuing bonds and government-approved securities. In September 2019, a decision at RBI directors meet was taken to change the RBI financial accounting year to March–April to align itself with the central government calendar instead of the current June–July year.

RBI issue taxable bonds for investments. From 1 July 2020, RBI is offering Floating Rate Savings Bonds, 2020 (Taxable) – FRSB 2020 (T). The interest on the bonds is payable semi-annually on 1 January and 1 July every year. The coupon on 1 January 2021 shall be paid at 7.15%. The Interest rate for next half-year will be reset every six months, the first reset being on 1 January 2021. There is no option to pay interest on cumulative basis.

=== Managing foreign exchange ===
The central bank manages to reach different goals of the &quot;Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999&quot;. Their objective is to facilitate external trade and payment and promote orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India.

With the increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy arising from greater trade and capital flows, the foreign exchange market has evolved as a key segment of the Indian financial market and the RBI has an important role to play in regulating and managing this segment. The RBI manages forex and gold reserves of the nation.

On a given day, the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply of foreign exchange arising from trade and capital transactions. The RBI&#x27;s Financial Markets Department (FMD) participates in the foreign exchange market by undertaking sales/purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in periods of excess demand for/supply of foreign currency.

=== Issue of currency ===
Other than the Government of India, the Reserve Bank of India is the sole body authorised to issue banknotes in India.

The bank also destroys banknotes when they are not fit for circulation. All the money issued by the central bank is its monetary liability, i.e., the central bank is obliged to back the currency with assets of equal value, to enhance public confidence in paper currency. The objectives are to issue banknotes and give the public adequate supply of the same, to maintain the currency and credit system of the country to utilise it in its best advantage, and to maintain the reserves.

The RBI maintains the economic structure of the country so that it can achieve the objective of price stability as well as economic development because both objectives are diverse in themselves.

For the printing of notes, RBI uses four facilities:
* The Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL), a wholly owned company of the Government of India, has printing presses at Nashik, Maharashtra and Dewas, Madhya Pradesh.
* The Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited (BRBNMPL), owned by the RBI, has printing facilities in Mysore, Karnataka and Salboni, West Bengal.

For the minting of coins, SPMCIL has four mints at Mumbai, Noida, Kolkata and Hyderabad for coin production.

Whilst coins are minted by, and 1 notes are issued by the Government of India (GoI), the RBI works as an agent of GoI for the distribution and handling of coins. RBI also works to prevent counterfeiting of currency by regularly upgrading security features of currency.

The RBI is authorised to issue notes with face values of up to 10,000 and coins up to 1,000 rupees.

New 500 and 2,000 notes were issued on 8 November 2016. The old series of 1,000 and 500 notes were banned on 8 November 2016, and are no longer in use.

Earlier 1,000 notes have been discarded by the RBI.

On 19 May 2023 the Reserve Bank of India announced the discontinuation of the Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes from circulation.

This decision follows the cessation of its printing in 2018-19 due to the ample availability of other denominations and the note&#x27;s limited use in transactions. This move aligns with the RBI&#x27;s &quot;Clean Note Policy,&quot; addressing the notes nearing the end of their lifespan and maintaining currency efficiency.

=== Bankers&#x27; bank ===
Reserve Bank of India also works as a central bank where commercial banks are account holders and can deposit money. RBI maintains banking accounts of all scheduled banks. Commercial banks create credit. It is the duty of the RBI to control the credit through the CRR, repo rate, and open market operations. As the bankers&#x27; bank, the RBI facilitates the clearing of cheques between the commercial banks and helps the inter-bank transfer of funds. It can grant financial accommodation to schedule banks. It acts as the lender of the last resort by providing emergency advances to the banks.

=== Detection of fake currency ===


On 22 January 2014; RBI gave a press release stating that after 31 March 2014, it will completely withdraw from circulation of all banknotes issued prior to 2005. From 1 April 2014, the public will be required to approach banks for exchanging these notes. Banks will provide exchange facility for these notes until further communication. The reserve bank has also clarified that the notes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean that banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as for non-customers. After 1 July 2014, to exchange more than 15 pieces of &#x27;500 and &#x27;1000 notes, non-customers must furnish proof of identity and residence as well as show &quot;aadhar&quot; to the bank branch in order to exchange the notes.

This move from the reserve bank is expected to unearth black money held in cash. As the new currency notes have added increased security features, they would help in curbing the menace of fake currency.

=== Developmental role ===
The central bank has to perform a wide range of promotional functions to support national objectives and industries. The RBI faces a lot of inter-sectoral and local inflation-related problems. Some of these problems are results of the dominant part of the public sector.

Key tools in this effort include Priority Sector Lending such as agriculture, micro and small enterprises (MSE), housing and education. RBI work towards strengthening and supporting small local banks and encourage banks to open branches in rural areas to include large section of society in banking net.

=== Custodian to foreign exchange ===
The Reserve Bank has custody of the country&#x27;s reserves of international currency, and this enables the Reserve Bank to deal with crisis connected with adverse balance of payments position.

=== CSD for G-Sec (government securities) ===
Public Debt Office (PDO) acts as CSD (Central Securities Depository) for G-Sec.

=== MIFOR (Mumbai interbank forward offer rate) ===
With LIBOR cessation in 2021, RBI is set to replace MIFOR with a new benchmark. MIFOR has LIBOR as one of the components and used in interest rate swap (IRS) markets.

== 2016 demonetisation ==

On 8 November 2016, the Government of India announced the demonetisation of all 500 and 1,000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series despite being warned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The government claimed that the action would curtail the shadow economy and crack down on the use of illicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and terrorism.

The Reserve Bank of India laid down a detailed procedure for the exchange of the demonetised banknotes with new 500 and 2,000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi New Series and 100 banknotes of the preceding Mahatma Gandhi Series. The key points were:

* Citizens had until 30 December 2016 to tender their old banknotes at any office of the RBI or any bank branch and credit the value into their respective bank accounts.
* Cash withdrawals from bank accounts were restricted to per day and per week per account from 10 to 13 November 2016. This limit was increased to per week from 14 November.
* For immediate cash needs, the old banknotes could be exchanged for the new ₹500 and ₹2,000 banknotes as well as ₹100 banknotes over the counter of bank branches by filling up a requisition form along with a valid ID proof. It was announced that this facility would be available until 30 December 2016.
** Initially, the limit was fixed at per person from 8 to 13 November 2016.
** This limit was increased to per person from 14 to 17 November 2016.
** The limit was reduced to per person from 18 November 2016.
** All exchange of banknotes was abruptly stopped from 25 November 2016.
* Initially, all ATMs were dispensing banknotes of only 50 and ₹100 denominations and cash withdrawals from ATMs were restricted to per day. From 14 November onwards, ATMs were recalibrated to dispense new ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes and to allow a maximum withdrawal of per day, while other ATMs dispensing banknotes of only ₹50 and ₹100 denominations will allow a maximum withdrawal of per day.

However, exceptions were given to petrol, CNG and gas stations, government hospitals, railway and airline booking counters, state-government recognised dairies and ration stores, and crematoriums to accept the old ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes until 11 November 2016, which was later extended to 14 November 2016 and once again to 24 November 2016. International airports were also instructed to facilitate an exchange of notes amounting to a total value of for foreign tourists and outbound passengers.

Under the revised guidelines issued on 17 November 2016, families were allowed to withdraw for wedding expenses from one account provided it was KYC compliant. The rules were also changed for farmers who are permitted to withdraw per week from their accounts against crop loan.

=== Cash crunch and demerits ===

The scarcity of cash due to demonetisation led to chaos, and most people holding old banknotes faced difficulties exchanging them due to endless lines outside banks and ATMs across India, which became a daily routine for millions of people waiting to deposit or exchange the 500 and 1,000 banknotes since 9 November. ATMs were running out of cash after a few hours of being functional, and around half the ATMs in the country were non-functional. Sporadic violence was reported in New Delhi, but there were no reports of any grievous injury, people attacked bank premises and ATMs, and a ration shop was looted in Madhya Pradesh after the shop owner refused to accept 500 banknotes.

=== Merits ===

*It gave the country a ₹5 trillion advantage as there was a huge spike in country&#x27;s tax base and addition of 100,000 more pan card holders.
*There was a very big spike in digital transaction even small town and cities people adopted paying digitally for goods and services leading to sustained growth of non-cash payments.

== Policy rates and reserve ratios ==
=== Repo rate ===

Repo (repurchase) rate also known as the benchmark interest rate is the rate at which the RBI lends money to the commercial banks for a short-term (a maximum of 90 days). When the repo rate increases, borrowing from RBI becomes more expensive. If RBI wants to make it more expensive for the banks to borrow money, it increases the repo rate similarly, if it wants to make it cheaper for banks to borrow money it reduces the repo rate. If the repo rate is increased, banks can&#x27;t carry out their business at a profit whereas the very opposite happens when the repo rate is cut down. Generally, repo rates are cut down whenever the country needs to progress in banking and economy.

If banks want to borrow money (for short term, usually overnight) from RBI then banks have to charge this interest rate. Banks have to pledge government securities as collateral. This kind of deal happens through a re-purchase agreement. If a bank wants to borrow, it has to provide government securities at least worth 1 billion (could be more because of margin requirement which is 5%–10% of loan amount) and agree to repurchase them at at the end of borrowing period. So the bank has paid as interest. This is the reason it is called repo rate.

The government securities which are provided by banks as collateral can not come from quota (otherwise the SLR will go below 19.5% of and attract penalties).

To curb inflation, the RBI increases repo rate which will make borrowing costs for banks. Banks will pass this increased cost to their customers which make borrowing costly in the whole economy. Fewer people will apply for loans and aggregate demand will be reduced. This will result in inflation coming down. The RBI does the opposite to fight deflation. When the RBI reduces the repo rate, banks are not legally required to reduce their own base rate.

=== Reverse repo rate (RRR) ===

As the name suggest, reverse repo rate is just the opposite of repo rate. Reverse repo rate is the short-term borrowing rate in which commercial bank park their surplus in RBI. The reserve bank uses this tool when it feels there is too much money floating in the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate means that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result, banks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of lending it to others (people, companies, etc.) which is always risky.

Repo rate signifies the rate at which liquidity is injected into the banking system by RBI, whereas reverse repo rate signifies the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity from the banks. Currently, reverse repo rate is 3.35%.

=== Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) ===

Apart from the , banks are required to maintain liquid assets in the form of gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts the bank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities.

In well-developed economies, central banks use open market operations—buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market—to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting increasing to open market operations in recent years. Generally, the RBI uses:
#Minimum margins for lending against specific securities.
#A ceiling on the amounts of credit for certain purposes.
#The discriminatory rate of interest charged on certain types of advances.

Direct credit controls in India are of three types:
#Part of the interest rate structure, i.e., on small savings and provident funds, are administratively set.
#Banks are mandatory required to keep 18% of their NDTL (net demand and time liabilities) in the form of liquid assets.
#Banks are required to lend to the priority sectors to the extent of 40% of their advances.

The share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in safe and liquid assets, such as government securities, cash, and gold. Here it would be pertinent to mention the gold swap of July 2014. The present SLR is 18.00%.

=== Bank rate ===

Bank rate is defined in Section 49 of the RBI Act of 1934 as the &#x27;standard rate at which RBI is prepared to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers eligible for purchase&#x27;. When banks want to borrow long term funds from the RBI, it is the interest rate which the RBI charges to them. It is currently set to 4.65%. The bank rate is not used to control money supply, but penal rates continue to be linked to the bank rate. If a bank fails to meet or requirements then the RBI will impose a penalty of 300 basis points above bank rate.

=== Liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) ===

Liquidity adjustment facility was introduced in 2000. LAF is a facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India to scheduled commercial banks to avail of liquidity in case of need or to park excess funds with the RBI on an overnight basis against the collateral of government securities.

RBI accepts applications for a minimum amount of and in multiples of 50 million thereafter.

=== Cash reserve ratio (CRR) ===
CRR refers to the ratio of bank&#x27;s cash reserve balances with RBI with reference to the bank&#x27;s net demand and time liabilities to ensure the liquidity and solvency of the scheduled banks. The share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain as cash with the RBI. The RBI has set CRR at 4.5% A 1% change in CRR affects the economy by ₹1.37 trillion. An increase draw this amount from the economy, while a decrease injects this amount into the economy. So if a bank has of then it has to keep in cash with RBI. RBI pays no interest on CRR.

Let&#x27;s assume the economy is showing inflationary trends and the RBI wants to control this situation by adjusting and CRR. If the RBI increases SLR to 50% and CRR to 20% then bank will be left only with for operations. Now it will be very difficult for the bank to maintain profitability with such a small amount of capital. The bank will be left with no choice but to raise its interest rate which will make borrowing by its customers more costly. This will in turn reduce the overall demand and hence prices will eventually come down.

=== Open market operation (OMO) ===

Open market operation is the activity of buying and selling of government securities in open market to control the supply of money in banking system. When there is excess supply of money, central bank sells government securities thereby sucking out excess liquidity. Similarly, when liquidity is tight, RBI will buy government securities and thereby inject money supply into the economy.

On 23 March 2020, Reserve Bank of India infused ₹1 trillion (short scale) through term repo auction, a massive OMOs (open market operations) purchase of government securities. The Reserve Bank is monitoring the financial market conditions and liquidity situation in the economy as COVID-19 pandemic in India fears of a recession.

=== Marginal standing facility (MSF) ===
This scheme was introduced in May 2011 and all the scheduled commercial bank can participate in this scheme. Banks can borrow up to 2.5% per cent of their respective net demand and time liabilities. The RBI receives application under this facility for a minimum amount of  10 million and in multiples of  10 million thereafter.

The important difference from repo rate is that bank can pledge government securities from its SLR quota (up to one per cent). So even if SLR goes below 20.5% by pledging SLR quota securities under MSF, the bank will not have to pay any penalty. The marginal standing facility rate currently stands at 4.25%.

== Qualitative tools ==
=== Margin requirements ===

Loan-to-value (LTV) is the ratio of loan amount to the actual value of asset purchased.

The RBI regulates this ratio so as to control the amount a bank can lend to its customers. For example, an individual wants to buy a car using borrowed money and the car&#x27;s value is ₹1 million. If the LTV is set to 70% he can borrow a maximum of ₹700,000.

The RBI can decrease or increase to curb inflation or deflation respectively.

=== Selective credit control ===
Under this measure, the RBI can specifically instruct banks not to give loans to traders of certain commodities e.g. sugar, edible oil, etc. This prevents the speculation/hoarding of commodities using money from banks.

=== Moral suasion ===

Under this measure, the RBI try to persuade banks through meetings, conferences, media specific things under certain economic trends. For example, when the RBI reduces repo rate, it asks banks to reduce their base rate as well. Another example of this measure is to ask banks to reduce their non-performing assets.

== Limitations of monetary policy ==
In developing countries like India, monetary policy fails to show immediate or no results because the following factors:

# People do not employ alternative investment options. A large section of society still depends on saving accounts, fixed deposits, Public Provident Fund for investment. Commercial banks have large deposits. RBI is not the main or even prominent money supplier for these banks. So whatever monetary action central bank takes has little or late impact on the economy.
# Many people in rural areas are out of the banking net and whatever the RBI does, has no impact on their financial activities.
# Monsoon uncertainty adversely affects food production and thereby cause food inflation. Monetary policy has no impact on food inflation.

== RTGS and NEFT transactions&#x27; charges removal ==

RBI decided to remove charges on RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement System) and NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer).

== Regulation of variable pay of bank management ==
In November, RBI introduced a set of draft guidelines to regulate the variable pay of CEOs and top management at private banks. The new rules are in line with the Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability Board in April 2009. The rules will apply to CEOs, wholetime directors, and material risk takers at private banks, small finance banks and domestic executives of foreign banks. As per the new rules at least 50% of the pay should be based on individual, unit, business and firm wide performance evaluation which will be capped at 300% of the fixed pay. In case of variable pay above 200% then at least 50% of this amount should be via non-cash instruments. Share linked instruments are included as part of variable pay. Guaranteed bonus should not be part of the compensation package except in case of joining bonus. The RBI also has put clauses in place to clawback/malus in case of deteriorating performance. The bank shall identify a representative set of conditions when the recovery clause for clawback /malus can be invoked.

== Publications ==
A report titled &quot;Trend and Progress of Banking in India&quot; is published annually, as required by the &quot;Banking Regulation Act, 1949&quot;. The report sums up trends and developments throughout the financial sector. Starting in April 2014, the Reserve Bank of India publishes bi-monthly policy updates.

==Committees set up by RBI==
===KV Kamath Committee===
In August 2020, RBI set up a five membered Committee under the chairmanship of KV Kamath, the former CEO of the ICICI bank in order to make recommendations on the norm for resolution of COVID-19 related stressed loans. In order to restructure the loans up to ₹150 billion, the expert Committee was tasked with coming up with a sector specific plan for successful resolution of the stressed loans. The parameters were to include aspects related to leverage, liquidity and debt serviceability.

== Attempt to caution customers against virtual currencies ==
In April 2018, RBI banned banks from supporting crypto transactions after cases of fraud through virtual currencies were reported. However, the Supreme Court struck down the ban in March 2020. Among the reasons cited was that cryptocurrencies were not illegal though unregulated in India.

<text>India Unbound: From Independence to Global Information Age is a 2000 non-fiction book by Gurcharan Das. It is an account of India&#x27;s economic journey after its Independence in 1947.

== Overview ==
&quot;India Unbound&quot; is mainly about the transformation of India from birth of the writer in (1942) to 1999. The author majorly speaks about the Indian politics and the economy of India. He categorizes the complete timeline from 1942 to 1999 in three major sections: &#x27;Spring of Hope (1942–1965)&#x27;, &#x27;the Lost Generation (1966–1991)&#x27; and &#x27;Rebirth of Dream (1991–1999)&#x27; and tell various stories(memoirs) and the historical facts of that time. The book is a great mixture of memoir, economic analysis, social investigation, political scrutiny and managerial outlook being thrown into the understanding of India. It begins shortly before independence and continues until the new millennium. As other authors cherish the revolution that began with independence in 1947, Gurcharan Das does not find full cause for jubilation until 1991, when India unleashed a series of economic reforms, the start of an &quot;economic revolution&quot; that he believes &quot;may well be more important than the political revolution.&quot;

The book starts with a brief history of 18th and 19th century India. Gurucharan Das starts with the augmentation of the railways in India, which was presumed to usher India into the Industrial Revolution. The book also points to the factors which led to the decline in the Indian economy under the British Raj.

The ‘Spring of Hope’ (1942–1965) describes the period in Indian history when it embarks upon as an independent country. The post independence economic policy followed the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru is socialist in nature which gives all the control over the industry to the public sector. Nehru was ably supported by some of the best economists from across India. He sets up a mixed economy which is a middle path between democratic rights followed by the Western countries and socialist ideology of the Soviet world.

The &#x27;Lost Generation&#x27; (1966–1991) refers to the phase of Indian Polity and economy which saw fading of the Indian dream. The economic policies followed by Indira Gandhi with the advice of her trusted economic advisers led India in to a very slow growth rate. The book cites an irony when it states that the &#x27;Garibi Hatao&#x27; policies followed by Mrs. Indira Gandhi were actually working counter-productively and throwing millions of Indians further into poverty rather than alleviating their plight. The author marks the declaration of &#x27;Emergency&#x27; as the lowest point of Indian Polity. Gurucharan Das gives a resounding account of his personal tryst with the Indian bureaucratic system prevailing at that time. He gives the account of incompetency spread in the Indian set-up which was choking the country’s economy to the death and License Raj which was the greatest hurdle to the growth of India.

<text>The Triratna Buddhist Community, formerly the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), is an international fellowship of Buddhists. It was founded in the UK in 1967 by Sangharakshita (born Dennis Philip Edward Lingwood) and describes itself as &quot;an international network dedicated to communicating Buddhist truths in ways appropriate to the modern world&quot;. In keeping with Buddhist traditions, it also pays attention to contemporary ideas, particularly drawn from Western philosophy, psychotherapy, and art.

Worldwide, more than 100 groups are affiliated with the community, including in North America, Australasia and Europe. In the UK, it is one of the largest Buddhist movements, with some 30 urban centres and retreat centres. The UK based international headquarters is at Adhisthana retreat centre in Coddington, Herefordshire. Its largest following, however, is in India, where it is known as Triratna Bauddha Mahāsaṅgha (TBM), formerly the Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Sahayaka Gana (TBMSG).

The community has been described as &quot;perhaps the most successful attempt to create an ecumenical international Buddhist organization&quot;. It has also been criticised for lacking &quot;spiritual lineage&quot; and has faced allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Practices and activities==
Meditation is the common thread through activities. Order members teach two practices: the &quot;mindfulness of breathing&quot; (&quot;anapanasati&quot;), in which practitioners focus on the rise and fall of the breath, and &quot;metta Bhavana&quot;, which approximately translates from the original Pali as &quot;the cultivation of lovingkindness&quot;. These practices are felt to be complementary in promoting equanimity and friendliness towards others. Some friends of the Order may have little, if any, other involvement in its activities, but friendship, Sangha, and community are encouraged at all levels as essential contexts for meditation.

The founder, Sangharakshita, taught a system of practice emphasising five types of meditation. The first two, according to his system (&#x27;integration&#x27; and &#x27;positive emotion&#x27;), can be correlated to the traditional category of &quot;calming&quot;samatha&quot;&quot; practices and the last two (spiritual death and spiritual rebirth) can be correlated to &quot;insight&quot; or &quot;vipassana&quot; practices. For those not ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order, the practices associated with the first two are emphasised, though the spirit of the last two is also taught. The five types of meditation correspond to five &#x27;stages&#x27; of the spiritual life.

These five stages are:

# Integration: The main practice at this stage is the mindfulness of breathing, which is intended to have the effect of &quot;integrating the psyche&quot;—improving mindfulness and concentration and reducing psychological conflict.
# Positive emotion: The second aspect of &quot;samatha&quot; is developing positivity—an other-regarding, life-affirming attitude. The &quot;Brahmavihara&quot; meditations, especially the &quot;metta bhavana&quot; or cultivation of loving kindness meditations, are the key practices intended to foster the development of positive emotion.
# Spiritual death: The next stage is to develop insight into what is seen to be the emptiness of the self and reality. Meditations at this stage include considering the elements of which self and world are thought to be composed, contemplating impermanence (particularly of the body), contemplating suffering, and contemplating &quot;sunyata&quot;.
# Spiritual rebirth: Triratna teaches that a person is spiritually reborn with the development of insight and the death of the limited ego-self. Among the main practices in this phase are visualizations of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Each dharmachari (&#x27;farer in the dharma&#x27;) is given an advanced visualization meditation on a particular figure at ordination.
# Receptivity and spontaneous compassionate activity: The practice associated with this phase is known as &quot;just sitting&quot; or &quot;formless&quot; meditation. Outside of meditation, this is the phase of &quot;Dharmic responsiveness&quot;—doing whatever needs to be done in any situation.

Centres also teach scripture, yoga and other methods of self-improvement, some of which are felt by some commentators to come from outside the Buddhist tradition. Recently, community activities have begun to include outdoor festivals, online meditation courses, arts festivals, poetry and writing workshops, tai chi, karate, and pilgrimages to Buddhist holy sites in India. For many years, the community charity Karuna Trust (UK) has raised money for aid projects in India.

As among Buddhists generally, Puja is a ritual practice at some events intended to awaken the desire to liberate all beings from suffering. The most common ritual consists of a puja, derived and adapted from the &quot;Bodhicaryavatara&quot; of Shantideva.

Retreats allow one to focus on meditational practice more intensely in a residential context outside a retreatant&#x27;s everyday life. Community retreats can be broadly categorised into meditation retreats, study retreats, and solitary retreats. Retreat lengths vary from short weekends to one or two weeks.

Businesses that operate on the principle of &quot;right livelihood&quot; generate funds for the movement and seek to provide environments for spiritual growth through employment. Emphasis is placed on teamwork, and on contributing to the welfare of others: for example by funding social projects and by considering ethical matters such as fair trade. The largest community business was Windhorse: Evolution, a gift wholesaling business and a chain of gift shops. Windhorse: Evolution closed down in 2015.

Many cities with a Triratna centre also have a residential community. The first of these was formed after a retreat where some participants wanted to continue retreat-style living. Since it was felt that the most stable communities tended to be single-sex, this has become the paradigm for communities. Support from fellow practitioners in a community is seen to be effective in helping members make spiritual progress.

The largest Triratna centre in the UK is the London Buddhist Centre in Bethnal Green, East London, which offers drop-in lunchtime and evening meditation sessions each weekday, open to beginners, as well as courses and classes through the week. The centre&#x27;s courses for depression, based on the mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy methodology of Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, featured in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 2008. This initiative is supported by the local authority, the London borough of Tower Hamlets. &quot;The Times&quot; has also reported on the centre&#x27;s work with those affected by alcohol dependency.

==Defining the movement==
According to the community, six characteristics define it:
# An ecumenical movement. It is not identified with any particular strand or school of Buddhism, but draws inspiration from many. It calls itself &quot;ecumenical&quot; rather than &quot;eclectic&quot; because it is founded on the premise that there is an underlying unity to all schools.
# &quot;Going for refuge&quot; is central. &quot;Going for Refuge to the Three Jewels&quot; – meaning the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha – is considered to be what makes someone a Buddhist.
# A unified Order. Unlike some sangha, the community does not propagate a monastic lineage. Sangharakshita devised a non-monastic ordination system, whilst also allowing the undertaking of the &quot;anagarika&quot; precept which enjoins celibacy. Identical ordination is open to both sexes. While the movement regards single-sex activities as important to spiritual growth, men and women are recognised as being equally able to practice and develop spiritually.
# An emphasis on spiritual friendship. There is a strong emphasis on the sangha, and spiritual friendship based on shared values. The community teaches that spending time with friends who share ideals, and engaging in ritual practice with them, supports ethical living and the arising of the bodhicitta.
# Teamwork. Working together in teams, in the spirit of generosity and with a focus on ethics, is considered a transformative spiritual practice.
# Importance of art. Engagement in, and an appreciation of, the arts are considered to be a valuable aspect of spiritual practice. The community teaches that a refinement of one&#x27;s artistic tastes can help refine emotional sensitivity and provide a channel for the expression of right living, and spiritual growth. More broadly, the movement seeks ways to re-express Buddhism by making connections with sympathetic elements in the surrounding culture, regarding the arts as such an aspect of western culture.

&quot;The FWBO&#x27;s attitude to spreading the Dharma is one of heartfelt urgency,&quot; wrote Stephen Batchelor, a prominent British Buddhist author, in a book published in 1994. &quot;For the FWBO, Western Society as such needs to be subject to the unflinching scrutiny of Buddhist values.&quot;

==The Triratna Buddhist Order==
The Triratna Buddhist Order is the focal-point of the community, and is a network of friendships between individuals who have made personal commitments to the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha, in communion with others.
Members are known as dharmacharis (masculine) or dharmacharinis (feminine), and are ordained in accord with a ceremony formulated by the founder. At ordination they are given a religious name in Pali or Sanskrit. While there is an informal hierarchy within the order, there are no higher ordinations. A small number of members, however, take vows of celibacy and adopt a simpler lifestyle. Contrary to the traditional Buddhist structure of separating lay and monastic members, the order combines monastic and lay lifestyles under one ordination, a practice not dissimilar to that which evolved in some Japanese schools of Buddhism. When members are ordained, they are given a white kesa to signify their ordination; golden kesas may be taken later by those choosing to make a public commitment to greater simplicity of lifestyle, including celibacy.

As with followers of the Shingon school of Buddhism, order members observe ten precepts (ethical training rules). These precepts are different from monastic vows and do not appear in the Vinaya Pitaka, but were formulated on the basis of the so-called &quot;dasa-kusala-dhammas&quot; (ten wholesome actions). These are found in several places in the Pāli Canon, as well as in some Sanskrit sources. The karma sections of the fundamental meditation texts of all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism also list these acts as basic guidelines for lay or ordained practitioners intent on observing the law of cause and effect.

Beyond this, a commitment to personal dharma practice and to remain in communication with other members are the only expectations. Ordination confers no special status, nor any specific responsibilities, although many order members choose to take on responsibilities for such things as teaching meditation and dharma. In mid-2008, there were around 1,500 members of the order, in more than 20 countries.

==The wider community==
In the Triratna community, as in the Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions, &quot;sangha&quot; is interpreted as the Buddhist community as a whole. Someone who regularly attends community activities is considered to be a &quot;friend&quot;. Friends do not have to regard themselves as Buddhists, and can be of any faith, or none. Some choose, after some time, to participate in a formal ceremony of affiliation, and thus become a &quot;mitra.&quot; &quot;Mitra&quot; is Sanskrit for &quot;friend&quot;, which in this case denotes a person who considers themselves Buddhist, who makes an effort to live in accordance with the five ethical precepts, and who feels that this spiritual community is the appropriate one for them.

Those who wish to join the Order must request this in writing. It will then take several years to prepare for ordination. This is an informal process, the focus of which is to deepen one&#x27;s commitment.

Some Friends, Mitras and Order members decide, at least for a while, to study teachings from outside the community, including non-Buddhist traditions such as Sufism.

==History==
As the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, the community was founded in London in April 1967 by Sangharakshita. He had then recently returned to England after spending two decades as a Buddhist and monk in India, following demobilisation from the British army. He had been born in south London as Dennis Lingwood, in August 1925. He would lead the organisation until his formal retirement in 1995, and would continue to exert a decisive influence on its thinking and practices thereafter.

In the 1990s, the order grew in India, and, according to the Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Indian members now make up about half the movement&#x27;s formal membership. In a book published in 2005, the FWBO&#x27;s members and supporters were estimated to number 100,000, the majority of whom were in India.

In 1997, the responsibility for ordination and spiritual leadership passed to a &quot;preceptors&#x27; college&quot;, based in Birmingham. In 2000, the first chair of a preceptors&#x27; council was chosen by Sangharakshita. In future, this position will be elected by the WBO to five-year terms.

In 2003, the public preceptors, responding to feedback, decided to move away from a formal relationship to the order and movement, and to concentrate on the ordination of new order members, teaching and dharma practice. At the same time, to increase flexibility, the number of preceptors was expanded.

==Name change==
In the spring of 2010, the Western Buddhist Order and Friends of the Western Buddhist Order changed their names to the Triratna Buddhist Order (which approximates in English to the name used in India - Triratna Bauddha Mahasangha) and the Triratna Buddhist Community. Since its western foundation the movement had spread to other parts of the world, including India where it was known by a different, non-western, name, and Indian members had long wished for one single worldwide name. An official history acknowledges this to have been controversial among some Order members. (&quot;Triratna&quot; is a Sanskrit term meaning Three Jewels)

==Triratna Refuge Tree==
Sangharakshita developed a refuge tree for Triratna, so that members of the community could better develop a relationship with his spiritual inspirations, which come from a wide variety of Buddhist traditions.

The central figure is Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha. He is flanked by Dipankara, the Buddha of the past and Maitreya, the Buddha of the future. To the left of them is a company of five Bodhisattvas: Avalokiteśvara, Manjushri, Green Tara, Vajrapani, and Kṣitigarbha. To the right of the Buddhas sit five of his main historical disciples: Ānanda, Śāriputra, Maudgalyayana, Mahākāśyapa and Dhammadinna.

In front of the Buddhas, sits Sangharakshita surrounded by his eight main teachers: Dhardo Rimpoche, Jamyang Khysente Rimpoche, Chatral Rimpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rimpoche, Dudjom Rimpoche, Kachu Rimpoche, Yogi Chen, and Bhikkhu Jagdish Kashyap.

They are flanked by B. R. Ambedkar and Anagarika Dharmapala.

Behind the Buddhas, are a huge pile of Dharma texts. Above them sit the &quot;teachers of the past&quot;. Japanese teachers: Hakuin Ekaku, Kūkai, Dōgen, Shinran. Chinese teachers: Huineng, Zhiyi, Xuanzang. Teachers of Tibet: Milarepa, Atiśa, Padmasambhava, Je Tsongkhapa. Indian teachers: Vasubandhu, Shantideva, Buddhaghosa, Nagarjuna, and Asanga. 

Above them, sit the Five Tathāgatas: Akshobhya, Amitābha, Amoghasiddhi, Ratnasambhava, Vairocana. At the very top, Vajrasattva.

==Controversies and criticism==

===Spiritual lineage===
Although Sangharakshita studied under, and in some cases received initiations from, eminent Buddhist teachers during his two decades in India, including Jagdish Kashyap, Dhardo Rinpoche, HH Dudjom Rinpoche, HH Dilgo Khyentse, and Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, author James William Coleman has noted that &quot;he never worked closely enough with any teacher to be recognized as a dharma-heir&quot;.

Rather than leadership by a guru, the community instead operates through what has been called a &quot;friendly hierarchy,&quot; which some critics have said can cause problems. In 1997, Stephen Batchelor, a prominent Buddhist commentator, was quoted as saying that the FWBO operated as &quot;a self-enclosed system&quot; and that their writings &quot;have the predictability of those who believe they have all the answers&quot;.

In 1980 Sangharakshita wrote of his &quot;conviction that the less the FWBO is involved with &#x27;Buddhist groups&#x27; and with individuals affiliated to existing Buddhist traditions, the better.&quot; Currently, however, the community is a member of the European Buddhist Union and the Network of Buddhist Organisations, individual members of the order serve on the board of the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, and the FWBO&#x27;s former magazine, &quot;Dharma Life&quot;, frequently carried articles by Buddhists from other organisations.

===1997 &quot;Guardian&quot; report===
In October 1997, a report by Madeleine Bunting, then the religious affairs correspondent of the British &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, made wide-ranging allegations of sexual misconduct, dogmatism and misogyny within the movement during the 1970s and 1980s.

The most detailed complaints reported were claims by Mark Dunlop, who had lived with the movement&#x27;s founder for a number of years in the early 1970s, and left the order in 1985. The report described intimate details of what Dunlop characterised as their relationship, and claimed that Sangharakshita, who declined to comment, had told him “that to develop spiritually he had to get over his anti-homosexual conditioning.”

The report contained further allegations from an anonymous source, who said that he had been persuaded into a sexual relationship with the leader of FWBO&#x27;s centre in Croydon, south of London. “The head of the community was a very powerful, intrusive personality and incredibly manipulative. He would intuitively become aware of people&#x27;s vulnerabilities,” the source was reported to have said.

A third concern drew on complaints by the mother of a former FWBO member who had committed suicide in 1990, following a history of depression. A report by a clinical psychologist said, among other things: “He feels the community attempted to alienate him from his family and from women, and that direct attempts were made to encourage him to practise homosexuality. He stated that he did not indulge in homosexual practices, although attempts were made for him to do so both by using inducements and by using threats.”

===Sexuality, women and the family===
Following &quot;The Guardian&quot; report, a widespread debate ensued. Critics pointed to writings by Sangharakshita, and his senior advisor Dharmachari Subhuti, which placed such emphasis on single-sex activities, and what the Triratna Buddhist Community calls “spiritual friendship”, that the potential for misunderstandings or inappropriate behaviour appeared to some to be inevitable.

The FWBO had long been known for questioning assumptions about family life, and, according to the Encyclopedia of Buddhism:

:&quot;Among the unique characteristics of the FWBO has been the open acceptance of homosexuality among the members. Order members have concluded that precept rules against abusing sexuality do not relate to the formal structure of sexual relations so much as to the nature of the relationship itself.&quot;

In an official biography of Sangharakshita, published in 1994, and reissued in 2009, Subhuti says: “Sangharakshita believes that men must break down their fear of homosexuality by facing the fact that there may be some element of sexual attraction towards their friends.”

&quot;The Guardian&quot; report also raised controversy over statements by Sangharakshita which it interpreted as adverse to women and the family. Expressing views found in Buddhist texts from their earliest times, he has argued, for example, that, at least in the early stages of their spiritual careers, men are more apt to commit themselves to the spiritual life than women. In 1986, he wrote that the couple and nuclear family can be sources of neurosis.
:&quot;A couple consists, in fact, of two half-people, each of whom unconsciously invests part of his or her total being in the other: each is dependent on the other for the kind of psychological security that can be found, ultimately, only within oneself.&quot;(Sangharakshita, 1986, Alternative Traditions).

Although scriptures and historians recognise that the Buddha himself had concerns over such issues, particularly after the birth of his son Rahula, when he left home convinced that &quot;family life was incompatible with the highest forms of spirituality&quot;, critics cite Sangharakshita&#x27;s conservative views as evidence that misogynystic attitudes persisted in the FWBO during the 1980s.
Evidence that those ideas may have been more widely held is also found in the writings of Subhuti, who echoes the sutras when he says in his book, &#x27;Women, men and angels,&#x27; that to be reborn as a woman is to be less spiritually able than to be reborn as a man.

As a movement, what was then the FWBO gave detailed responses and staunchly supported its founder, while in 2010 the renamed movement published an official history which acknowledged widespread concern among order members that, at least in the 1980s and before, the founder had misused his position as a Buddhist teacher to sexually exploit young men.

The controversies attracted little public interest, and between 2004 and 2008 both &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and its sister Sunday newspaper, &quot;The Observer&quot;, ran three supportive articles, recommending community activities.
A &quot;Guardian&quot; Web directory listed the FWBO website as &quot;a good starting point for children.&quot;

In a 2009 interview with a member of the group, Sangharakshita replied to a question about sex between him and students: “Perhaps in a very few cases they were not as willing as I had supposed at the time – that is possible.&quot; In reply to a follow-up question, he said: &quot;I did not regard myself as a teacher with a capital T.” He added: “I have had many, many human encounters, the great majority non-sexual, and most of those encounters, including the sexual ones, have been satisfactory for both parties. If there were any encounters that were not satisfactory for the other person, whether at the time or in retrospect, then that is a pity and I am truly sorry that that should be the case.&quot;

===2016 abuse report===
In September 2016, BBC News reported that former members of the Triratna movement claimed that they had been subject to sexual abuse by Sangharakshita at the group&#x27;s retreat centre in Norfolk. Following discussion on social media, another former member claimed that he had been groomed for sex by another senior member of the order at the group&#x27;s centre in Croydon in 1980s when he was 16 years old.

On 4 January 2017, following his treatment in hospital for pneumonia, Sangharakshita issued a statement expressing “deep regret for all the occasions on which I have hurt, harmed or upset fellow Buddhists, and ask for their forgiveness.&quot; On 19 January 2017, Triratna&#x27;s leadership issued a statement in response to Sangharakshita&#x27;s apology: “Consideration of some aspects of Bhante [Sangharakshita]&#x27;s past has been difficult for some of us in the College, as it has been for many of our brothers and sisters in the Order and others associated with our community. Bhante is the founder of our Order and Movement, and we feel enormous appreciation and gratitude to him for his teachings and inspiration – and yet at the same time we must acknowledge the effects of some of his past actions.&quot;

===2018 internal report===
In October 2018, a group of members of the Triratna community released an internal report saying that more than one in 10 of them claim to have experienced or observed sexual misconduct while in the order, by Sangharakshita and other senior members. In July 2019, the group shared the report with &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper.

<text>The Senate of Finland (; ) combined the functions of cabinet and supreme court in the Grand Duchy of Finland from 1816 to 1917 and in independent Finland from 1917 to 1918.

The body that would become the Senate was established on August 18, 1809, when Tsar Alexander I of Russia summoned the Diet of Porvoo and directed the Diet to draw up regulations for a Government Council. In 1816, Alexander renamed this body the &quot;Senate&quot; to demonstrate that it was equal to rather than inferior to its Russian equivalent.

The Senate was headed by the Governor-General of Finland. The members of the Senate had to be Finnish citizens. The Senate was divided into the economic division and the judicial division. In 1822 both divisions were given a Finnish vice-chairman. From 1858 and onwards the members of the senate were formally known as &quot;senators.&quot; After the February Revolution in Russia the Vice Chairman of the Economic Division became the Chairman of the Senate. Due to the Civil War in 1918 the Senate was relocated to the town of Vaasa from January 29 to May 3.

In 1918 the economic division became the Cabinet and the judicial division became the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court of the independent Finland. The vice chairman of the economic division became the Prime Minister of Finland, and the other senators became ministers. Finland became a republic in 1919.

<doc id="277085" wikidata="Q678317" url="?curid=277085" title="Fock state">
<text>In quantum mechanics, a Fock state or number state is a quantum state that is an element of a Fock space with a well-defined number of particles (or quanta). These states are named after the Soviet physicist Vladimir Fock. Fock states play an important role in the second quantization formulation of quantum mechanics.

The particle representation was first treated in detail by Paul Dirac for bosons and by Pascual Jordan and Eugene Wigner for fermions. The Fock states of bosons and fermions obey useful relations with respect to the Fock space creation and annihilation operators.

==Definition==
One specifies a multiparticle state of &quot;N&quot; non-interacting identical particles by writing the state as a sum of tensor products of &quot;N&quot; one-particle states. Additionally, depending on the integrality of the particles&#x27; spin, the tensor products must be alternating (anti-symmetric) or symmetric products of the underlying one-particle Hilbert spaces. Specifically:

* Fermions, having half-integer spin and obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, correspond to antisymmetric tensor products. 
* Bosons, possessing integer spin (and not governed by the exclusion principle) correspond to symmetric tensor products.

If the number of particles is variable, one constructs the Fock space as the direct sum of the tensor product Hilbert spaces for each particle number. In the Fock space, it is possible to specify the same state in a new notation, the occupancy number notation, by specifying the number of particles in each possible one-particle state.

Let formula_1 be an orthonormal basis of states in the underlying one-particle Hilbert space. This induces a corresponding basis of the Fock space called the &quot;occupancy number basis&quot;. A quantum state in the Fock space is called a Fock state if it is an element of the occupancy number basis.

A Fock state satisfies an important criterion: for each &quot;i&quot;, the state is an eigenstate of the particle number operator formula_2 corresponding to the &quot;i&quot;-th elementary state ki. The corresponding eigenvalue gives the number of particles in the state. This criterion nearly defines the Fock states (one must in addition select a phase factor).

A given Fock state is denoted by formula_3. In this expression, formula_4 denotes the number of particles in the i-th state ki, and the particle number operator for the i-th state, formula_2, acts on the Fock state in the following way:

: formula_6

Hence the Fock state is an eigenstate of the number operator with eigenvalue formula_4.

Fock states often form the most convenient basis of a Fock space. Elements of a Fock space that are superpositions of states of differing particle number (and thus not eigenstates of the number operator) are not Fock states. For this reason, not all elements of a Fock space are referred to as &quot;Fock states&quot;.

If we define the aggregate particle number operator formula_8 as
: formula_9

the definition of Fock state ensures that the variance of measurement formula_10, i.e., measuring the number of particles in a Fock state always returns a definite value with no fluctuation.

==Example using two particles==
For any final state formula_11, any Fock state of two identical particles given by formula_12, and any operator formula_13, we have the following condition for indistinguishability:
: formula_14.

So, we must have formula_15

where formula_16 for bosons and formula_17 for fermions. Since formula_18 and formula_19 are arbitrary, we can say, 
: formula_20 for bosons and 
: formula_21 for fermions.

Note that the number operator does not distinguish bosons from fermions; indeed, it just counts particles without regard to their symmetry type. To perceive any difference between them, we need other operators, namely the creation and annihilation operators.

==Bosonic Fock state==
Bosons, which are particles with integer spin, follow a simple rule: their composite eigenstate is symmetric under operation by an exchange operator. For example, in a two particle system in the tensor product representation we have formula_22 .

===Boson creation and annihilation operators===
We should be able to express the same symmetric property in this new Fock space representation. For this we introduce non-Hermitian bosonic creation and annihilation operators, denoted by formula_23 and formula_24 respectively. The action of these operators on a Fock state are given by the following two equations:

* Creation operator formula_25:
*: formula_26
* Annihilation operator formula_27:
*: formula_28

====Non-Hermiticity of creation and annihilation operators====
The bosonic Fock state creation and annihilation operators are not Hermitian operators.
\left\langle n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l} - 1, \dots
 | n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l} - 1, \dots \right\rangle \\[6pt]
 \left(\left\langle n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l}, \dots
 \left| b_{\mathbf{k}_l} \right|
 n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l} - 1, \dots \right\rangle\right)^*
 &amp;= \left\langle n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l} - 1 \dots
 \left| b_{\mathbf{k}_l}^\dagger \right|
 n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l}, \dots \right\rangle \\
 &amp;= \sqrt{n_{\mathbf{k}_l} + 1}\left\langle n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l} - 1 \dots
 | n_{\mathbf{k}_1}, n_{\mathbf{k}_2}, n_{\mathbf{k}_3} \dots n_{\mathbf{k}_l} + 1 \dots \right\rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it is clear that adjoint of creation (annihilation) operator doesn&#x27;t go into itself. Hence, they are not Hermitian operators.

But adjoint of creation (annihilation) operator is annihilation (creation) operator.

====Operator identities====
The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators in a bosonic system are
: formula_29
: formula_30
where formula_31 is the commutator and formula_32 is the Kronecker delta.

===N bosonic basis states ===
===Action on some specific Fock states===
, 0__{2}}, 0__{3}}...0__{l}}, ...\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
: formula_33

and, formula_34. That is, the &quot;l&quot;-th creation operator creates a particle in the &quot;l&quot;-th state kl, and the vacuum state is a fixed point of annihilation operators as there are no particles to annihilate.
| We can generate any Fock state by operating on the vacuum state with an appropriate number of creation operators:
: formula_35
| For a single mode Fock state, expressed as, formula_36,
: formula_37 and, 
: formula_38

===Action of number operators===
The number operators formula_39 for a bosonic system are given by formula_40, where formula_41

Number operators are Hermitian operators.

===Symmetric behaviour of bosonic Fock states===
The commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators ensure that the bosonic Fock states have the appropriate symmetric behaviour under particle exchange. Here, exchange of particles between two states (say, &quot;l&quot; and &quot;m&quot;) is done by annihilating a particle in state &quot;l&quot; and creating one in state &quot;m&quot;. If we start with a Fock state formula_42, and want to shift a particle from state formula_43 to state formula_44, then we operate the Fock state by formula_45 in the following way:

Using the commutation relation we have, formula_46
: formula_47

So, the Bosonic Fock state behaves to be symmetric under operation by Exchange operator.

==Fermionic Fock state==

===Fermion creation and annihilation operators===
To be able to retain the antisymmetric behaviour of fermions, for Fermionic Fock states we introduce non-Hermitian fermion creation and annihilation operators, defined for a Fermionic Fock state formula_48 as:

* The creation operator formula_49 acts as:
*: formula_50
* The annihilation operator formula_51 acts as:
*: formula_52

These two actions are done antisymmetrically, which we shall discuss later.

====Operator identities====
The anticommutation relations of creation and annihilation operators in a fermionic system are,
: formula_53 

where formula_54 is the anticommutator and formula_32 is the Kronecker delta. These anticommutation relations can be used to show antisymmetric behaviour of &quot;Fermionic Fock states&quot;.

===Action of number operators===
Number operators formula_39 for Fermions are given by formula_57.
: formula_41

====Maximum occupation number====
The action of the number operator as well as the creation and annihilation operators might seem same as the bosonic ones, but the real twist comes from the maximum occupation number of each state in the fermionic Fock state. Extending the 2-particle fermionic example above, we first must convince ourselves that a fermionic Fock state formula_59 is obtained by applying a certain sum of permutation operators to the tensor product of eigenkets as follows:
: formula_60

This determinant is called the Slater determinant. If any of the single particle states are the same, two rows of the Slater determinant would be the same and hence the determinant would be zero. Hence, two identical fermions must not occupy the same state (a statement of the Pauli exclusion principle). Therefore, the occupation number of any single state is either 0 or 1. The eigenvalue associated to the fermionic Fock state formula_61 must be either 0 or 1.

===N fermionic basis states formula_62 ===
===Action on some specific Fock states===

===Antisymmetric behaviour of Fermionic Fock state===
Antisymmetric behaviour of Fermionic states under Exchange operator is taken care of the anticommutation relations. Here, exchange of particles between two states is done by annihilating one particle in one state and creating one in other. If we start with a Fock state formula_63 and want to shift a particle from state formula_43 to state formula_44, then we operate the Fock state by formula_66 in the following way:

Using the anticommutation relation we have 
: formula_67
: formula_68

but,
formula_69

Thus, fermionic Fock states are antisymmetric under operation by particle exchange operators.

==Fock states are not energy eigenstates in general==
In second quantization theory, the Hamiltonian density function is given by 
:formula_70

The total Hamiltonian is given by
:formula_71

In free Schrödinger theory, 
:formula_72

and 
:formula_73

and 
: formula_74,

where formula_75 is the annihilation operator.

: formula_76

Only for non-interacting particles do formula_77 and formula_75 commute; in general they do not commute. For non-interacting particles,
: formula_79

If they do not commute, the Hamiltonian will not have the above expression. Therefore, in general, Fock states are not energy eigenstates of a system.

==Vacuum fluctuations==

The vacuum state or formula_80 is the state of lowest energy and the expectation values of formula_81 and formula_82 vanish in this state:

:formula_83

The electrical and magnetic fields and the vector potential have the mode expansion of the same general form:

:formula_84

The expectation values of these field operators vanishes in the vacuum state:

:formula_85

However, the expectation values of the square of these field operators is non-zero: there are fluctuations in the field about the zero ensemble average. These vacuum fluctuations are responsible for many interesting phenomenon including the Lamb shift in quantum optics.

==Multi-mode Fock states==
In a multi-mode field each creation and annihilation operator operates on its own mode. So formula_86 and formula_87 will operate only on formula_88. Since operators corresponding to different modes operate in different sub-spaces of the Hilbert space, the entire field is a direct product of formula_89 over all the modes:

:formula_90

The creation and annihilation operators operate on the multi-mode state by only raising or lowering the number state of their own mode:

:formula_91

We also define the total number operator for the field which is a sum of number operators of each mode:
:formula_92

The multi-mode Fock state is an eigenvector of the total number operator whose eigenvalue is the total occupation number of all the modes
:formula_93

In case of non-interacting particles, number operator and Hamiltonian commute with each other and hence multi-mode Fock states become eigenstates of the multi-mode Hamiltonian

:formula_94

==Source of single photon state==

Single photons are routinely generated using single emitters (atoms, ions, molecules, Nitrogen-vacancy center, Quantum dot). However, these sources are not always very efficient, often presenting a low probability of actually getting a single photon on demand; and often complex and unsuitable out of a laboratory environment.

Other sources are commonly used that overcome these issues at the expense of a nondeterministic behavior. Heralded single photon sources are probabilistic two-photon sources from whom the pair is split and the detection of one photon heralds the presence of the remaining one. These sources usually rely on the optical non-linearity of some materials like periodically poled Lithium niobate (Spontaneous parametric down-conversion), or silicon (spontaneous Four-wave mixing) for example.

==Non-classical behaviour==
The Glauber–Sudarshan P-representation of Fock states shows that these states are purely quantum mechanical and have no classical counterpart. The formula_95 of these states in the representation is a formula_96&#x27;th derivative of the Dirac delta function and therefore not a classical probability distribution.

<text>Chidambaram Subramaniam (commonly known as CS) (30 January 1910 – 7 November 2000), was an Indian politician and independence activist. He served as Minister of Finance and Minister of Defence in the union cabinet. He later served as the Governor of Maharashtra. As the Minister for Food and Agriculture, he ushered the Indian Green Revolution, an era of self-sufficiency in food production along with M. S. Swaminathan, B. Sivaraman and Norman E. Borlaug. He was awarded Bharat Ratna, Indian&#x27;s highest civilian award, in 1998, for his role in ushering Green Revolution.

==Early life and education==
Subramaniam was born in Senguttaipalayam a village near Pollachi in Coimbatore district, Presidency of Fort St. George (now the Tamil Nadu state). Subramaniam completed his early education in Pollachi before moving to Chennai where he did his B.Sc in Physics at the Presidency College, Chennai (affiliated to the University of Madras). Later he graduated with degree in law from Madras Law college, Chennai (then affiliated to the same university). During his college days, he started &quot;Vanamalar Sangam&quot; and published a magazine called &quot;Pithan&quot; from Gobichettipalayam along with Periyasaamy Thooran, K. M. Ramasami Gounder, O. V. Alagesan and Justice Palanisami. His inspiration was his uncle Swami Chidbhavananda.

==Political career==

===Early years===
Subramaniam was an active member of the Civil disobedience movement against the British during his college days. He was imprisoned during the Quit India Movement in 1942. He was later elected to the Constituent Assembly and had a hand in the framing of the Constitution of India. He was a minister of Education, Law and Finance for Madras State from 1952 to 1962 under chief ministers Rajaji and K. Kamaraj. He was the First Leader of the House in the Madras Legislative Assembly for the entire duration. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1962 and was the Minister for Steel and Mines. Subsequently, he served as the Minister for Food and Agriculture. He also worked as the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission from 2 May 1971 to 22 July 1972.

===Green Revolution===
Along with M. S. Swaminathan and B. Sivaraman, Subramaniam was the architect of India&#x27;s modern agricultural development policy, after the success of his programme which led to a record production of wheat in 1972 termed as the Indian Green Revolution. As Minister for Food and Agriculture, he introduced high-yielding varieties of seeds and more intensive application of fertilizers which paved the way for increased output of cereals and attainment of self-sufficiency in food-grains in the country. About his contribution, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, writes:

He appointed M. S. Swaminathan, who played a major role in green revolution and Verghese Kurien as the chairman of National Dairy Development Board when he ushered the Indian White Revolution. Kurien says, &quot;that the key role played by Subramaniam in the whole thing (Operation Flood) is hardly mentioned.&quot; He founded the National Agro Foundation, Chennai and Bharathidasan Institute of Management, Tiruchirappalli.

===Finance ministry and emergency===
When the Indian National Congress split in 1969, he became the interim president of the Congress (R) faction led by Indira Gandhi. Later, he was appointed Minister of Finance in the union cabinet by Indira Gandhi. He advised her to devalue Indian rupee and was the finance minister during the Emergency in 1976. After the Emergency, he parted ways with Indira and joined the breakaway Congress faction led by Devraj Urs and Kasu Brahmananda Reddy.

===Later years===
He was appointed the union Minister of Defence by Charan Singh in 1979. He became the Governor of Maharashtra in 1990. He resigned after his criticism of the style of functioning of the then Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao.

Subramaniam died on 7 November 2000 at the age of 90 in Chennai. At his death, he was the last surviving cabinet minister who had served under Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as the last surviving cabinet minister from the Shastri and Nanda cabinets.

==Awards==
* Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honor, 1998
* Y. B. Chavan National Integration Award
* U Thant peace award, 1996
* Norman Borlaug award, 1996
* Anuvrat award, 1988

==Publications==
* &quot;The New Strategy in Indian Agriculture&quot;
* &quot;Some Countries which I visited Round The World&quot;
* &quot;The India of My Dreams&quot;

==Legacy==

A commemorative coin in his honour, was released by the Government of India in August 2010. A commemorative postage stamp was also released in his honour in 2010.

Shri Chidambaram Subramaniam Award - For Excellence in Character has been instituted by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavans which is awarded to its students annually.

<text>In mathematics, a root system is a configuration of vectors in a Euclidean space satisfying certain geometrical properties. The concept is fundamental in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, especially the classification and representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras. Since Lie groups (and some analogues such as algebraic groups) and Lie algebras have become important in many parts of mathematics during the twentieth century, the apparently special nature of root systems belies the number of areas in which they are applied. Further, the classification scheme for root systems, by Dynkin diagrams, occurs in parts of mathematics with no overt connection to Lie theory (such as singularity theory). Finally, root systems are important for their own sake, as in spectral graph theory.

==Definitions and examples==

As a first example, consider the six vectors in 2-dimensional Euclidean space, R2, as shown in the image at the right; call them roots. These vectors span the whole space. If you consider the line perpendicular to any root, say &quot;β&quot;, then the reflection of R2 in that line sends any other root, say &quot;α&quot;, to another root. Moreover, the root to which it is sent equals &quot;α&quot; + &quot;nβ&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is an integer (in this case, &quot;n&quot; equals 1). These six vectors satisfy the following definition, and therefore they form a root system; this one is known as &quot;A&quot;2.

===Definition===
Let &quot;E&quot; be a finite-dimensional Euclidean vector space, with the standard Euclidean inner product denoted by formula_1. A root system formula_2 in &quot;E&quot; is a finite set of non-zero vectors (called roots) that satisfy the following conditions:

# The roots span &quot;E&quot;.
# The only scalar multiples of a root formula_3 that belong to formula_2 are formula_5 itself and formula_6.
# For every root formula_3, the set formula_2 is closed under reflection through the hyperplane perpendicular to formula_5.
# (Integrality) If formula_5 and formula_11 are roots in formula_2, then the projection of formula_11 onto the line through formula_5 is an &quot;integer or half-integer&quot; multiple of formula_5.

Equivalent ways of writing conditions 3 and 4, respectively, are as follows:
# For any two roots formula_16, the number formula_17 is an integer.

Some authors only include conditions 1–3 in the definition of a root system. In this context, a root system that also satisfies the integrality condition is known as a crystallographic root system. Other authors omit condition 2; then they call root systems satisfying condition 2 reduced. In this article, all root systems are assumed to be reduced and crystallographic.

In view of property 3, the integrality condition is equivalent to stating that &quot;β&quot; and its reflection &quot;σ&quot;&quot;α&quot;(&quot;β&quot;) differ by an integer multiple of &quot;α&quot;. Note that the operator
formula_18
defined by property 4 is not an inner product. It is not necessarily symmetric and is linear only in the first argument. 

The rank of a root system Φ is the dimension of &quot;E&quot;. 
Two root systems may be combined by regarding the Euclidean spaces they span as mutually orthogonal subspaces of a common Euclidean space. A root system which does not arise from such a combination, such as the systems &quot;A&quot;2, &quot;B&quot;2, and &quot;G&quot;2 pictured to the right, is said to be irreducible.

Two root systems (&quot;E&quot;1, Φ1) and (&quot;E&quot;2, Φ2) are called isomorphic if there is an invertible linear transformation &quot;E&quot;1 → &quot;E&quot;2 which sends Φ1 to Φ2 such that for each pair of roots, the number formula_19 is preserved.

The of a root system Φ is the Z-submodule of &quot;E&quot; generated by Φ. It is a lattice in &quot;E&quot;.

===Weyl group===
The group of isometries of &quot;E&quot; generated by reflections through hyperplanes associated to the roots of Φ is called the Weyl group of Φ. As it acts faithfully on the finite set Φ, the Weyl group is always finite. The reflection planes are the hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots, indicated for formula_20 by dashed lines in the figure below. The Weyl group is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle, which has six elements. In this case, the Weyl group is not the full symmetry group of the root system (e.g., a 60-degree rotation is a symmetry of the root system but not an element of the Weyl group).

===Rank one example===

There is only one root system of rank 1, consisting of two nonzero vectors formula_21. This root system is called formula_22.

===Rank two examples===

In rank 2 there are four possibilities, corresponding to formula_23, where formula_24. The figure at right shows these possibilities, but with some redundancies: formula_25 is isomorphic to formula_26 and formula_27 is isomorphic to formula_28.

Note that a root system is not determined by the lattice that it generates: formula_29 and formula_27 both generate a square lattice while formula_20 and formula_32 both generate a hexagonal lattice.

Whenever Φ is a root system in &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;S&quot; is a subspace of &quot;E&quot; spanned by Ψ = Φ ∩ &quot;S&quot;, then Ψ is a root system in &quot;S&quot;. Thus, the exhaustive list of four root systems of rank 2 shows the geometric possibilities for any two roots chosen from a root system of arbitrary rank. In particular, two such roots must meet at an angle of 0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 135, 150, or 180 degrees.

===Root systems arising from semisimple Lie algebras===

If formula_33 is a complex semisimple Lie algebra and formula_34 is a Cartan subalgebra, we can construct a root system as follows. We say that formula_35 is a root of formula_33 relative to formula_34 if formula_38 and there exists some formula_39 such that
formula_40
for all formula_41. One can show that there is an inner product for which the set of roots forms a root system. The root system of formula_33 is a fundamental tool for analyzing the structure of formula_33 and classifying its representations. (See the section below on Root systems and Lie theory.)

==History==
The concept of a root system was originally introduced by Wilhelm Killing around 1889 (in German, &quot;Wurzelsystem&quot;). He used them in his attempt to classify all simple Lie algebras over the field of complex numbers. (Killing originally made a mistake in the classification, listing two exceptional rank 4 root systems, when in fact there is only one, now known as F4. Cartan later corrected this mistake, by showing Killing&#x27;s two root systems were isomorphic.)

Killing investigated the structure of a Lie algebra formula_44 by considering what is now called a Cartan subalgebra formula_34. Then he studied the roots of the characteristic polynomial formula_46, where formula_47. Here a &quot;root&quot; is considered as a function of formula_34, or indeed as an element of the dual vector space formula_49. This set of roots forms a root system inside formula_49, as defined above, where the inner product is the Killing form.

==Elementary consequences of the root system axioms==


The cosine of the angle between two roots is constrained to be one-half of the square root of a positive integer. This is because formula_51 and formula_52 are both integers, by assumption, and
formula_53

Since formula_54, the only possible values for formula_55 are formula_56 and formula_57, corresponding to angles of 90°, 60° or 120°, 45° or 135°, 30° or 150°, and 0° or 180°. Condition 2 says that no scalar multiples of &quot;α&quot; other than 1 and −1 can be roots, so 0 or 180°, which would correspond to 2&quot;α&quot; or −2&quot;α&quot;, are out. The diagram at right shows that an angle of 60° or 120° corresponds to roots of equal length, while an angle of 45° or 135° corresponds to a length ratio of formula_58 and an angle of 30° or 150° corresponds to a length ratio of formula_59.

In summary, here are the only possibilities for each pair of roots.
*Angle of 90 degrees; in that case, the length ratio is unrestricted.
*Angle of 60 or 120 degrees, with a length ratio of 1.
*Angle of 45 or 135 degrees, with a length ratio of formula_60.
*Angle of 30 or 150 degrees, with a length ratio of formula_61.

==Positive roots and simple roots==

Given a root system formula_2 we can always choose (in many ways) a set of positive roots. This is a subset formula_63 of formula_2 such that 
* For each root formula_3 exactly one of the roots formula_5, formula_6 is contained in formula_63.
* For any two distinct formula_69 such that formula_70 is a root, formula_71.

If a set of positive roots formula_63 is chosen, elements of formula_73 are called negative roots. A set of positive roots may be constructed by choosing a hyperplane formula_74 not containing any root and setting formula_63 to be all the roots lying on a fixed side of formula_74. Furthermore, every set of positive roots arises in this way.

An element of formula_63 is called a simple root (also &quot;fundamental root&quot;) if it cannot be written as the sum of two elements of formula_63. (The set of simple roots is also referred to as a base for formula_2.) The set formula_80 of simple roots is a basis of formula_81 with the following additional special properties:
*Every root formula_3 is a linear combination of elements of formula_80 with &quot;integer&quot; coefficients.
*For each formula_3, the coefficients in the previous point are either all non-negative or all non-positive.

For each root system formula_2 there are many different choices of the set of positive roots—or, equivalently, of the simple roots—but any two sets of positive roots differ by the action of the Weyl group.

==Dual root system, coroots, and integral elements==
===The dual root system===
If Φ is a root system in &quot;E&quot;, the coroot α∨ of a root α is defined by
formula_86

The set of coroots also forms a root system Φ∨ in &quot;E&quot;, called the dual root system (or sometimes &quot;inverse root system&quot;).
By definition, α∨ ∨ = α, so that Φ is the dual root system of Φ∨. The lattice in &quot;E&quot; spanned by Φ∨ is called the &quot;coroot lattice&quot;. Both Φ and Φ∨ have the same Weyl group &quot;W&quot; and, for &quot;s&quot; in &quot;W&quot;,
formula_87

If Δ is a set of simple roots for Φ, then Δ∨ is a set of simple roots for Φ∨.

In the classification described below, the root systems of type formula_88 and formula_89 along with the exceptional root systems formula_90 are all self-dual, meaning that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original root system. By contrast, the formula_91 and formula_92 root systems are dual to one another, but not isomorphic (except when formula_93).

===Integral elements===

A vector formula_94 in &quot;E&quot; is called integral if its inner product with each coroot is an integer:
formula_95
Since the set of formula_96 with formula_97 forms a base for the dual root system, to verify that formula_94 is integral, it suffices to check the above condition for formula_97.

The set of integral elements is called the weight lattice associated to the given root system. This term comes from the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras, where the integral elements form the possible weights of finite-dimensional representations.

The definition of a root system guarantees that the roots themselves are integral elements. Thus, every integer linear combination of roots is also integral. In most cases, however, there will be integral elements that are not integer combinations of roots. That is to say, in general the weight lattice does not coincide with the root lattice.

==Classification of root systems by Dynkin diagrams==

A root system is irreducible if it cannot be partitioned into the union of two proper subsets formula_100, such that formula_101 for all formula_102 and formula_103 .

Irreducible root systems correspond to certain graphs, the Dynkin diagrams named after Eugene Dynkin. The classification of these graphs is a simple matter of combinatorics, and induces a classification of irreducible root systems.

===Constructing the Dynkin diagram===

Given a root system, select a set Δ of simple roots as in the preceding section. The vertices of the associated Dynkin diagram correspond to the roots in Δ. Edges are drawn between vertices as follows, according to the angles. (Note that the angle between simple roots is always at least 90 degrees.)
*No edge if the vectors are orthogonal,
*An undirected single edge if they make an angle of 120 degrees,
*A directed double edge if they make an angle of 135 degrees, and 
*A directed triple edge if they make an angle of 150 degrees. 
The term &quot;directed edge&quot; means that double and triple edges are marked with an arrow pointing toward the shorter vector. (Thinking of the arrow as a &quot;greater than&quot; sign makes it clear which way the arrow is supposed to point.)

Note that by the elementary properties of roots noted above, the rules for creating the Dynkin diagram can also be described as follows. No edge if the roots are orthogonal; for nonorthogonal roots, a single, double, or triple edge according to whether the length ratio of the longer to shorter is 1, formula_60, formula_61. In the case of the formula_32 root system for example, there are two simple roots at an angle of 150 degrees (with a length ratio of formula_61). Thus, the Dynkin diagram has two vertices joined by a triple edge, with an arrow pointing from the vertex associated to the longer root to the other vertex. (In this case, the arrow is a bit redundant, since the diagram is equivalent whichever way the arrow goes.)

===Classifying root systems===
Although a given root system has more than one possible set of simple roots, the Weyl group acts transitively on such choices. Consequently, the Dynkin diagram is independent of the choice of simple roots; it is determined by the root system itself. Conversely, given two root systems with the same Dynkin diagram, one can match up roots, starting with the roots in the base, and show that the systems are in fact the same.

Thus the problem of classifying root systems reduces to the problem of classifying possible Dynkin diagrams. A root systems is irreducible if and only if its Dynkin diagram is connected. The possible connected diagrams are as indicated in the figure. The subscripts indicate the number of vertices in the diagram (and hence the rank of the corresponding irreducible root system).

If formula_2 is a root system, the Dynkin diagram for the dual root system formula_109 is obtained from the Dynkin diagram of formula_2 by keeping all the same vertices and edges, but reversing the directions of all arrows. Thus, we can see from their Dynkin diagrams that formula_91 and formula_92 are dual to each other.

==Weyl chambers and the Weyl group==
If formula_113 is a root system, we may consider the hyperplane perpendicular to each root formula_5. Recall that formula_115 denotes the reflection about the hyperplane and that the Weyl group is the group of transformations of formula_81 generated by all the formula_115&#x27;s. The complement of the set of hyperplanes is disconnected, and each connected component is called a Weyl chamber. If we have fixed a particular set Δ of simple roots, we may define the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to Δ as the set of points formula_118 such that formula_119 for all formula_97.

Since the reflections formula_121 preserve formula_2, they also preserve the set of hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots. Thus, each Weyl group element permutes the Weyl chambers.

The figure illustrates the case of the formula_20 root system. The &quot;hyperplanes&quot; (in this case, one dimensional) orthogonal to the roots are indicated by dashed lines. The six 60-degree sectors are the Weyl chambers and the shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to the indicated base.

A basic general theorem about Weyl chambers is this:
:Theorem: The Weyl group acts freely and transitively on the Weyl chambers. Thus, the order of the Weyl group is equal to the number of Weyl chambers.
In the formula_20 case, for example, the Weyl group has six elements and there are six Weyl chambers.

A related result is this one:
:Theorem: Fix a Weyl chamber formula_125. Then for all formula_118, the Weyl-orbit of formula_127 contains exactly one point in the closure formula_128 of formula_125.

==Root systems and Lie theory==
Irreducible root systems classify a number of related objects in Lie theory, notably the following:
*simple complex Lie algebras (see the discussion above on root systems arising from semisimple Lie algebras),
*simply connected complex Lie groups which are simple modulo centers, and
*simply connected compact Lie groups which are simple modulo centers.
In each case, the roots are non-zero weights of the adjoint representation.

We now give a brief indication of how irreducible root systems classify simple Lie algebras over formula_130, following the arguments in Humphreys. A preliminary result says that a semisimple Lie algebra is simple if and only if the associated root system is irreducible. We thus restrict attention to irreducible root systems and simple Lie algebras.

*First, we must establish that for each simple algebra formula_131 there is only one root system. This assertion follows from the result that the Cartan subalgebra of formula_131 is unique up to automorphism, from which it follows that any two Cartan subalgebras give isomorphic root systems. 
*Next, we need to show that for each irreducible root system, there can be at most one Lie algebra, that is, that the root system determines the Lie algebra up to isomorphism. 
*Finally, we must show that for each irreducible root system, there is an associated simple Lie algebra. This claim is obvious for the root systems of type A, B, C, and D, for which the associated Lie algebras are the classical Lie algebras. It is then possible to analyze the exceptional algebras in a case-by-case fashion. Alternatively, one can develop a systematic procedure for building a Lie algebra from a root system, using Serre&#x27;s relations.

For connections between the exceptional root systems and their Lie groups and Lie algebras see E8, E7, E6, F4, and G2.

==Properties of the irreducible root systems==
Irreducible root systems are named according to their corresponding connected Dynkin diagrams. There are four infinite families (A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;, and D&quot;n&quot;, called the classical root systems) and five exceptional cases (the exceptional root systems). The subscript indicates the rank of the root system.

In an irreducible root system there can be at most two values for the length , corresponding to short and long roots. If all roots have the same length they are taken to be long by definition and the root system is said to be simply laced; this occurs in the cases A, D and E. Any two roots of the same length lie in the same orbit of the Weyl group. In the non-simply laced cases B, C, G and F, the root lattice is spanned by the short roots and the long roots span a sublattice, invariant under the Weyl group, equal to &quot;r&quot;2/2 times the coroot lattice, where &quot;r&quot; is the length of a long root.

In the adjacent table, denotes the number of short roots, denotes the index in the root lattice of the sublattice generated by long roots, &quot;D&quot; denotes the determinant of the Cartan matrix, and |&quot;W&quot;| denotes the order of the Weyl group.
==Explicit construction of the irreducible root systems==

===&quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;===
Let &quot;E&quot; be the subspace of R&quot;n&quot;+1 for which the coordinates sum to 0, and let Φ be the set of vectors in &quot;E&quot; of length and which are &quot;integer vectors,&quot; i.e. have integer coordinates in R&quot;n&quot;+1. Such a vector must have all but two coordinates equal to 0, one coordinate equal to 1, and one equal to −1, so there are &quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; roots in all. One choice of simple roots expressed in the standard basis is for .

The reflection &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot; through the hyperplane perpendicular to α&quot;i&quot; is the same as permutation of the adjacent &quot;i&quot;th and (&quot;i&quot; + 1)th coordinates. Such 
transpositions generate the full permutation group.
For adjacent simple roots, 
&quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;(α&quot;i&quot;+1) = α&quot;i&quot;+1 + α&quot;i&quot; = &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1(α&quot;i&quot;) = α&quot;i&quot; + α&quot;i&quot;+1, that is, reflection is equivalent to adding a multiple of 1; but
reflection of a simple root perpendicular to a nonadjacent simple root leaves it unchanged, differing by a multiple of 0.

The &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; root lattice – that is, the lattice generated by the &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; roots – is most easily described as the set of integer vectors in R&quot;n&quot;+1 whose components sum to zero.

The &quot;A&quot;2 root lattice is the vertex arrangement of the triangular tiling.

The &quot;A&quot;3 root lattice is known to crystallographers as the face-centered cubic (or cubic close packed) lattice. It is the vertex arrangement of the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.

The &quot;A&quot;3 root system (as well as the other rank-three root systems) may be modeled in the Zometool construction set.

In general, the &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; root lattice is the vertex arrangement of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplicial honeycomb.

===&quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;===

Let &quot;E&quot; = R&quot;n&quot;, and let Φ consist of all integer vectors in &quot;E&quot; of length 1 or . The total number of roots is 2&quot;n&quot;2. One choice of simple roots is for (the above choice of simple roots for &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1), and the shorter root .

The reflection &quot;σ&quot;&quot;n&quot; through the hyperplane perpendicular to the short root α&quot;n&quot; is of course simply negation of the &quot;n&quot;th coordinate. 
For the long simple root α&quot;n&quot;−1, σ&quot;n&quot;−1(α&quot;n&quot;) = α&quot;n&quot; + α&quot;n&quot;−1, but for reflection perpendicular to the short root, &quot;σ&quot;&quot;n&quot;(α&quot;n&quot;−1) = α&quot;n&quot;−1 + 2α&quot;n&quot;, a difference by a multiple of 2 instead of 1.

The &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; root lattice—that is, the lattice generated by the &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; roots—consists of all integer vectors.

&quot;B&quot;1 is isomorphic to &quot;A&quot;1 via scaling by , and is therefore not a distinct root system.
===&quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;===


Let &quot;E&quot; = R&quot;n&quot;, and let Φ consist of all integer vectors in &quot;E&quot; of length together with all vectors of the form 2&quot;λ&quot;, where &quot;λ&quot; is an integer vector of length 1. The total number of roots is 2&quot;n&quot;2. One choice of simple roots is: α&quot;i&quot; = e&quot;i&quot; − e&quot;i&quot;+1, for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; − 1 (the above choice of simple roots for &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1), and the longer root α&quot;n&quot; = 2e&quot;n&quot;.
The reflection &quot;σ&quot;&quot;n&quot;(α&quot;n&quot;−1) = α&quot;n&quot;−1 + α&quot;n&quot;, but &quot;σ&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(α&quot;n&quot;) = α&quot;n&quot; + 2α&quot;n&quot;−1.

The &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; root lattice—that is, the lattice generated by the &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; roots—consists of all integer vectors whose components sum to an even integer.

&quot;C&quot;2 is isomorphic to &quot;B&quot;2 via scaling by and a 45 degree rotation, and is therefore not a distinct root system.
===&quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;===

Let , and let Φ consist of all integer vectors in &quot;E&quot; of length . The total number of roots is . One choice of simple roots is for (the above choice of simple roots for ) together with .

Reflection through the hyperplane perpendicular to α&quot;n&quot; is the same as transposing and negating the adjacent &quot;n&quot;-th and (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-th coordinates. Any simple root and its reflection perpendicular to another simple root differ by a multiple of 0 or 1 of the second root, not by any greater multiple.

The &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; root lattice – that is, the lattice generated by the &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; roots – consists of all integer vectors whose components sum to an even integer. This is the same as the &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; root lattice.

The &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; roots are expressed as the vertices of a rectified &quot;n&quot;-orthoplex, Coxeter–Dynkin diagram: ... The vertices exist in the middle of the edges of the &quot;n&quot;-orthoplex.

&quot;D&quot;3 coincides with &quot;A&quot;3, and is therefore not a distinct root system. The twelve &quot;D&quot;3 root vectors are expressed as the vertices of , a lower symmetry construction of the cuboctahedron.

&quot;D&quot;4 has additional symmetry called triality. The twenty-four &quot;D&quot;4 root vectors are expressed as the vertices of , a lower symmetry construction of the 24-cell.
===&quot;E&quot;6, &quot;E&quot;7, &quot;E&quot;8===
*The &quot;E&quot;8 root system is any set of vectors in R8 that is congruent to the following set:formula_133

The root system has 240 roots. The set just listed is the set of vectors of length in the E8 root lattice, also known simply as the E8 lattice or Γ8. This is the set of points in R8 such that:
# all the coordinates are integers or all the coordinates are half-integers (a mixture of integers and half-integers is not allowed), and
# the sum of the eight coordinates is an even integer.
Thus,
formula_134

* The root system &quot;E&quot;7 is the set of vectors in &quot;E&quot;8 that are perpendicular to a fixed root in &quot;E&quot;8. The root system &quot;E&quot;7 has 126 roots.
* The root system &quot;E&quot;6 is not the set of vectors in &quot;E&quot;7 that are perpendicular to a fixed root in &quot;E&quot;7, indeed, one obtains &quot;D&quot;6 that way. However, &quot;E&quot;6 is the subsystem of &quot;E&quot;8 perpendicular to two suitably chosen roots of &quot;E&quot;8. The root system &quot;E&quot;6 has 72 roots.
An alternative description of the &quot;E&quot;8 lattice which is sometimes convenient is as the set Γ&#x27;8 of all points in R8 such that
*all the coordinates are integers and the sum of the coordinates is even, or
*all the coordinates are half-integers and the sum of the coordinates is odd.
The lattices Γ8 and Γ&#x27;8 are isomorphic; one may pass from one to the other by changing the signs of any odd number of coordinates. The lattice Γ8 is sometimes called the &quot;even coordinate system&quot; for &quot;E&quot;8 while the lattice Γ&#x27;8 is called the &quot;odd coordinate system&quot;.

One choice of simple roots for &quot;E&quot;8 in the even coordinate system with rows ordered by node order in the alternate (non-canonical) Dynkin diagrams (above) is:
:α&quot;i&quot; = e&quot;i&quot; − e&quot;i&quot;+1, for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ 6, and
:α7 = e7 + e6
(the above choice of simple roots for &quot;D&quot;7) along with 
formula_135

One choice of simple roots for &quot;E&quot;8 in the odd coordinate system with rows ordered by node order in alternate (non-canonical) Dynkin diagrams (above) is
:α&quot;i&quot; = e&quot;i&quot; − e&quot;i&quot;+1, for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ 7
(the above choice of simple roots for &quot;A&quot;7) along with 
:α8 = β5, where
:formula_136
(Using β3 would give an isomorphic result. Using β1,7 or β2,6 would simply give &quot;A&quot;8 or &quot;D&quot;8. As for β4, its coordinates sum to 0, and the same is true for α1...7, so they span only the 7-dimensional subspace for which the coordinates sum to 0; in fact −2β4 has coordinates (1,2,3,4,3,2,1) in the basis (α&quot;i&quot;).)

Since perpendicularity to α1 means that the first two coordinates are equal, &quot;E&quot;7 is then the subset of &quot;E&quot;8 where the first two coordinates are equal, and similarly &quot;E&quot;6 is the subset of &quot;E&quot;8 where the first three coordinates are equal. This facilitates explicit definitions of &quot;E&quot;7 and &quot;E&quot;6 as
:

Note that deleting α1 and then α2 gives sets of simple roots for &quot;E&quot;7 and &quot;E&quot;6. However, these sets of simple roots are in different &quot;E&quot;7 and &quot;E&quot;6 subspaces of &quot;E&quot;8 than the ones written above, since they are not orthogonal to α1 or α2.

===&quot;F&quot;4===
For &quot;F&quot;4, let &quot;E&quot; = R4, and let Φ denote the set of vectors α of length 1 or such that the coordinates of 2α are all integers and are either all even or all odd. There are 48 roots in this system. One choice of simple roots is: the choice of simple roots given above for &quot;B&quot;3, plus formula_137.
The &quot;F&quot;4 root lattice—that is, the lattice generated by the &quot;F&quot;4 root system—is the set of points in R4 such that either all the coordinates are integers or all the coordinates are half-integers (a mixture of integers and half-integers is not allowed). This lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of Hurwitz quaternions.
===&quot;G&quot;2===

The root system &quot;G&quot;2 has 12 roots, which form the vertices of a hexagram. See the picture above.

One choice of simple roots is (α1, β = α2 − α1) where 
α&quot;i&quot; = e&quot;i&quot; − e&quot;i&quot;+1 for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2 is the above choice of simple roots for &quot;A&quot;2.

The &quot;G&quot;2 root lattice—that is, the lattice generated by the &quot;G&quot;2 roots—is the same as the &quot;A&quot;2 root lattice.
==The root poset==

The set of positive roots is naturally ordered by saying that formula_138 if and only if formula_139 is a nonnegative linear combination of simple roots. This poset is graded by formula_140, and has many remarkable combinatorial properties, one of them being that one can determine the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the corresponding Weyl group from this poset. The Hasse graph is a visualization of the ordering of the root poset.

<doc id="277088" wikidata="Q536269" url="?curid=277088" title="Pheochromocytoma">
<text>Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla composed of chromaffin cells and is part of the paraganglioma (PGL) family of tumors, being defined as an intra-adrenal PGL . These neuroendocrine tumors can be sympathetic, where they release catecholamines into the bloodstream which cause the most common symptoms, including hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (fast heart rate), sweating, and headaches. Some PGLs may secrete little to no catecholamines, or only secrete paroxysmally (episodically), and other than secretions, PGLs can still become clinically relevant through other secretions or mass effect (most common with head and neck PGL). PGLs of the head and neck are typically parasympathetic and their sympathetic counterparts are predominantly located in the abdomen and pelvis, particularly concentrated at the organ of Zuckerkandl at the bifurcation of the aorta.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The symptoms of a sympathetic pheochromocytoma are related to sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity. The classic triad includes headaches (likely related to elevated blood pressure, or hypertension), tachycardia/elevated heart rate, and diaphoresis (excessive sweating, particularly at night, also known as hyperhidrosis). However, patients are unlikely to experience continuous symptoms. Due to the paroxysmal nature of catecholamine synthesis and release, patients may experience &quot;attacks&quot; or &quot;spells&quot; where they are suddenly overwhelmed with signs and symptoms of their tumor. Attacks can occur spontaneously (without warning) or may be triggered by a variety of pharmaceutical agents (including histamine, metoclopramide, glucagon and adrenocorticotropic hormone), foods that contain tyramine (cheese and wine), intraoperative tumor manipulation, intubation, or during anesthetic induction. 

Other clinical manifestations that have been reported include (in no particular order):
* Pallor
* Heat intolerance
* Weight loss
* Chest and/or abdominal discomfort
* Palpitations
* Nausea/vomiting
* Constipation
* Orthostatic hypotension — becoming light-headed or dizzy after swiftly changing positions
* Psychiatric manifestations
** Anxiety, panic attacks, nervousness, tremors
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)

===Complications===
While the symptoms of a pheochromocytoma are quite common, the disease has been referred to as &quot;the great mimic&quot;. It is estimated that approximately 0.1% of patients with hypertension have a pheochromocytoma, and it is often misdiagnosed as essential hypertension. As symptoms are often paroxysmal (episodic/sporadic), patients may not immediately seek treatment as the problem &quot;disappears on its own.&quot; Furthermore, when pictured in the ideal clinical scenario (an older woman in her mid-50s), the spontaneous attacks of flushing, sweating, and a racing heart may be mistaken for pre-menopausal related hot flashes. Unmanaged pheochromocytoma is dangerous and can lead to serious, potentially fatal, complications, including stroke and hypertension-induced organ damage. The cardiovascular system is the most commonly involved.

In pregnancy, pheochromocytoma is associated with significant maternal and fetal mortality, mainly due to hypertensive crisis in the mother and intrauterine growth restriction in the fetus.

Misdiagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be deadly, as beta-blockers, often prescribed for hypertension, can lead to unopposed alpha in the context of pheochromocytoma. Most mortality associated with diagnosed pheochromocytoma came from surgery and hypertensive crisis, but mortality has greatly improved.

==== Cardiovascular system ====
# Hypertensive crisis: Pheochromocytoma-related hypertensive emergencies are one of the most feared clinical manifestations. Attacks are random and may occur secondary to a trigger (see Signs and Symptoms above) or spontaneously after a catecholamine surge. The prevailing symptom is elevated systolic blood pressure (&gt; 200 mmHg) that is unresponsive to traditional treatment regimens and threatens end-organ damage. Patients require immediate, life-saving treatment to prevent further damage to other organs and/or death.
# &quot;Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction:&quot; A heart attack is often caused by a significant build-up of plaque (atherosclerosis) in the coronary vessels. Patients with pheochromocytoma present with myocardial infarctions despite an overall lack of plaque build-up, indicating a different mechanism for the myocardial infarction. Current research hypothesizes that the tumor secretes massive amounts of catecholamines, which directly interact with myocardial (heart) tissue and exert negative effects including oxygen deprivation, leading to accelerated scarring and cell death.
# &quot;Toxic Myocarditis:&quot; Even in patients without myocardial damage, excessive catecholamines can result in abnormal ST changes on an ECG. Norepinephrine (a catecholamine) is hypothesized to result in damaged cardiac tissue by inhibiting coronary blood flow and depriving cells of oxygen, thus resulting in ischemic tissue. Fortunately, following tumor excision and the subsequent quelling of catecholamines, the damage has been proven reversible.
# &quot;Cardiomyopathy:&quot; Pheochromocytomas have been implicated in various types of cardiomyopathy, including (myocarditis, see above), dilated cardiomyopathy, and stress-induced or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. As with the other cardiovascular-related complications, excess catecholamines are responsible for the increased myocardial burden and significant physiologic stress. Current literature indicates that most of the catecholamine-induced damage is reversible, thereby strengthening the argument for early and accurate diagnosis in order to allow for cardiac remodeling and prevent further destruction.
# &quot;Arrhythmias:&quot; Sinus tachycardia is the most common abnormal heart rhythm associated with a pheochromocytoma and is experienced by patients as the feeling of a &quot;fluttering heart&quot; or palpitations. Many other tachyarrhythmias (fast heart rate) have also been reported.

==== Nervous system ====
# &quot;Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke):&quot; Multiple reports have detailed transient ischemic attacks or strokes in patients with a pheochromocytoma. In a study of 130 patients with pheochromocytoma, 7 patients were diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack (the neurologic deficit completely resolved) and 3 patients experienced a stroke with persistent symptoms.
# &quot;Headache:&quot; Headaches are one of the core clinical manifestations of a pheochromocytoma and can result in debilitating pain. The majority of studied patients report their pain began and ended abruptly without warning and described the pain as a severe, bilateral throbbing (although the scale of severity was not published). While 71% of the studied patients reported headaches, just over 20% of the affected patients endorsed associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, which are typically associated with migraines.

==== Urinary system ====
# &quot;Acute Renal Failure:&quot; Several reports have detailed rhabdomyolysis (rapid skeletal muscle breakdown) leading to acute kidney injury and the need for transient dialysis in the undiagnosed pheochromocytoma patient as their primary presenting symptom. Kidney failure is brought about by catecholamine-induced muscle injury. Norepinephrine causes vessels to narrow, thereby limiting blood flow and inducing ischemia.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): Caused by an elevated inflammatory response, multiple organ dysfunction is a severe, life-threatening emergency with increasing mortality based on the number of systems involved. Pheochromocytoma-related MODS is associated with multiple organ failure, hyperthermia &gt; 40 degrees Celsius, neurologic manifestations, and cardiovascular instability resulting in either hypo or hypertension. In contrast to a hypertensive crisis, pheochromocytoma-associated MODS may not respond to traditional alpha-receptor agents and may require emergent surgical excision if clinical stability is not achieved.

==Genetics==
Current estimates predict that upwards of 40% of all pheochromocytomas are related to an inherited germline susceptibility mutation. Of the remaining 60% of tumors, more than 30% are associated with a somatic mutation. Given the high association with genetic inheritance, the United States Endocrine Society recommends that all patients diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma undergo an evaluation with a genetic counselor to consider genetic testing. In the UK eligibility for NHS funded genetic testing is determined by criteria set by NHS England Genomics service. The criteria in 2024 included all patients with paraganglioma and all patients with unilateral pheochromocytoma aged under 60. The most recent data indicates that there are 25 pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes; however, just 12 are recognized as part of a well-known syndrome. Determining the genetic status of a pheochromocytoma patient is crucial — each gene is inherited in a different pattern, associated with specific disease characteristics, and may respond more favorably to certain treatment options. Furthermore, early identification can guide physicians on screening recommendations for first degree relatives of patients with pheochromocytoma. There is no current consensus for how and when asymptomatic carriers (individual who has a genetic variant associated with pheochromocytoma, but no current evidence of disease) should be evaluated. Conversations should occur at an individual level with the patient and their provider to develop a personalized screening plan that alternates between a biochemical (blood work) evaluation and whole-body imaging to monitor disease progression.

===Pediatric considerations===
Additional practices may help maintain the emotional and psychological well-being of the minor. Screening includes a multidisciplinary team (endocrinologist, oncologist, psychologist, geneticist, parent, and child) where the primary focus is supporting the child.
* A positive result from testing during family-observed days of celebration may mask the happiness associated with these events in the future.
* Testing one pediatric sibling at a time allows the family to narrow their focus when results are returned and support each sibling individually.
* A negative result may be upsetting to a child if their sibling was positive; an opportunity to ask questions and process results may be helpful.

=== Hereditary syndromes ===
The following table(s) detail the clinical characteristics of the well-known hereditary pheochromocytoma gene variants
MEN2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia-2); VHL (von-Hippel Lindau); NF1 (Neurofibromatosis-1); NET (Neuroendocrine Tumor); CNS (Central Nervous System)

SDHx (Succinate Dehydrogenase Subunit x)

===Other gene variants===
There have been several published case reports of other, rare pheochromocytoma-associated susceptibility genes:

# Pacak–Zhuang Syndrome
#* Hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (&quot;HIF2A)&quot;
#* Polycythemia
#* Duodenal somatostatinoma
#* Retinal and choroidal vascular changes
#* Paraganglioma/Pheochromocytoma
# Pheochromocytoma and Giant Cell Tumor of Bone
#* H3 histone, family 3A (&quot;H3F3A),&quot; post-zygotic G34W
#* Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma
# Carney Triad
#* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor
#* Pulmonary chondroma
#* Paraganglioma
# Carney-Stratakis Syndrome
#* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor
#* Paraganglioma
Several additional gene variants have been described, but the provided information is inconsistent and a consensus has not been reached in the community if these mutations are truly pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential===
The typical primary symptom is hypertension, which may be either episodic or continual. A diagnosis of pheochromocytoma should be suspected when the patient simultaneously presents with hypertension and the classic triad of heart palpitations, headaches, and profuse sweating.

If a patient has the characteristic signs and symptoms of a pheochromocytoma and the decision is made to pursue additional biochemical (blood work) evaluation, the differential diagnosis is important as it is more likely to be something other than a pheochromocytoma given the relative frequency of 0.8 per 100,000 person-years.

All patients with phaeochromocytomas are currently considered to have a lifelong risk of metastases and therefore conceptually they are all considered &#x27;malignant&#x27;. The risk of metastasis ranges from ~5 to 15%. There is no single histological finding or biomarker to reliably predict metastatic disease, and multiparameter scoring systems have been proposed 

====Notes====
===Biochemical evaluation===

====Gold standard====

Elevated plasma free metanephrines is considered the gold standard diagnosis for pheochromocytoma. Over 10 studies have confirmed that the sensitivity and specificity of this test is 97% and 93% respectively; however, there is still concern for false positive results in the correct clinical scenario. When interpreting a biochemical analysis for pheochromocytoma, the provider must pay close attention to the (1) conditions of the collection, (2) &quot;all&quot; medications the patient is taking, and (3) their diet.

# &quot;Conditions of Collection:&quot; Unlike many routine laboratory tests that can be drawn at a moments notice, there are several recommendations that should be followed to ensure the ideal conditions and an accurate sample. Current research indicates that blood work should only be drawn after a patient has been resting supine (flat on their back) for 30 minutes before collection. Specific supine reference values should be used in this scenario. Ensuring these conditions is difficult and may be cost-prohibitive at most institutions. In these cases, a rested, supine draw can be repeated following a positive result in a seated position to eliminate false-positive results.
# &quot;Pharmaceutical Interference:&quot; Many prescription, over-the-counter, and illicit substances can interfere with the proper collection of plasma metanephrines and lead to false-positive results. Providers should review a patient&#x27;s medication list in-detail and have a discussion if temporarily discontinuing any of the interfering medications is possible. The most reported medications to result in falsely elevated metanephrines include: β-adrenoceptor blockers, phenoxybenzamine, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and methyldopa. As the majority of these medications are commonly prescribed for psychiatric conditions, a conversation with the prescriber may be necessary to facilitate alternative therapeutic options while the patient is undergoing evaluation for a pheochromocytoma. After any possible prescription medications have been held, it is important to review any over-the-counter medications/supplements as well as the commonly used acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine cause false elevations in metanephrine levels. Finally, it is important to have open, non-judgemental discussions about the patient&#x27;s recreational substance use. Amphetamines, nicotine, and cocaine can result in marked plasma norepinephrine levels.
# &quot;Lifestyle and Diet:&quot; As with most lab work, the patient should refrain from eating (fasting) after midnight the night prior to their collection. However, there are further recommendations specific to a metanephrines collection, including abstaining from nicotine, alcohol, and exercise for at least 12 hours prior to their lab draw. Patients should also avoid catecholamine-containing foods (fruits, fruit drinks, chocolate, caffeine, tomatoes, beans, nuts, and potatoes) for a minimum of 24 hours prior to collection.
While the above (3) conditions are likely to contribute to false-positive results if not controlled for, any value greater than 3 to 4 times the upper reference limit of normal should be considered diagnostic for a pheochromocytoma.

====Alternative tests====
Twenty-four hour urinary metanephrines are an acceptable alternative if the plasma test is unavailable. Other additional biomarkers can be helpful to aid in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma as well, most notable is Chromogranin A. In comparison to the specificity of elevated catecholamines in the pheochromocytoma patient, chromogranin A is a non-specific polypeptide that is high in a variety of neuroendocrine tumors. However, a 2006 report from Italy found that over 90% of studied pheochromocytoma patients demonstrated elevated chromogranin A levels. If metanephrine values are equivocal, chromogranin A can be used as an adjunct marker to predict the presence of a tumor.

Borderline elevated metanephrines present a diagnostic challenge to the physician — the first step is to repeat the labs, taking extra precautions to follow the gold standard diagnosis described above, including the conditions of collection, pharmaceutical interference, and any potential diet and lifestyle habits that could alter the results. If the offending medications cannot be discontinued or repeated labs remained the same, consider administering a clonidine suppression test. In the 1970s, the drug clonidine hydrocloride swept the market as a novel agent for hypertension; however, the reported side-effects (nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dryness of the eyes and mouth, constipation, and generalized weakness) limit compliance and have vastly diminished prescriptions. While the adverse side-effects with clonidine are inconvenient, the most dangerous aspect of clonidine is withdrawal rebound hypertension — that is, when the medicine is abruptly discontinued, blood pressure may rapidly return or surpass the original value. However, a one-time, weight-based dose can be utilized in limited settings to help determine disease status. After fasting overnight, patients will present to their testing site for a baseline metanephrines blood draw and clonidine administration. They will remain supine for (3) hours and a repeat blood draw will be taken. A positive result (indicating a pheochromocytoma) will occur if the plasma metanephrine levels remain elevated after clonidine is given. If the results are the same or fall, the test is negative and the patient does not have a pheochromocytoma. It is important to note that if a patient &quot;does not&quot; have a pheochromocytoma, they may become extremely hypotensive following clonidine. Patients should not depend on themselves for transport following this test.

Plasma methoxytyramine is a breakdown product of the catecholamine, dopamine. Paragangliomas of the head and neck commonly secrete dopamine, but are referred to as &quot;biochemically silent&quot; because they do not cause the characteristic symptoms associated with a pheochromocytoma. However, methoxytyramine can be utilized to detect the tumors of the head and neck. Further research indicates that the biomarker is also a useful indicator of metastatic disease — which is the only current biochemical evidence of metastases to date.

====Biochemical phenotypes====
While diagnostic, laboratory values can also provide physician&#x27;s with important information about the type, location, size, and associated tumor genotype. There are (3) major, well-recognized biochemical phenotypes that can be used by health care providers to direct patient care.
# &quot;Adrenergic&quot; (Epinephrine and metanephrine)
#* More likely to indicate an adrenal tumor
#* When plasma metanephrine levels were elevated to greater than 15% of the combined levels of normetanephrine and metanephrine, an adrenal tumor or a recurrence of an adrenal tumor that had already been excised can be predicted
#* Patients are more likely to present with the classic, paroxysmal (episodic) symptoms described above
# &quot;Noradrengeric&quot; (Norepinephrine and normetanephrine)
#* More likely to indicate an extra-adrenal tumor
#* Patients are more likely to present with continuous, persistent pheochromocytoma-related symptoms (hypertension and tachycardia) compared to those that are classically episode with an adrenergic phenotype
#* Common in patients with von-Hippel Lindau and succinate dehydrogenase subunit X genetic variants
# &quot;Dopaminergic&quot; (Dopamine and 3-methoxytyramine)
#* More likely to indicate an extra-adrenal tumor of the head and neck
#* Patients are more likely to be asymptomatic; however, they may present with non-specific signs of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss secondary to the stimulation of dopamine receptors throughout the gastrointestinal tract
#* Particularly prevalent in patients with succinate dehydrogenase subunit B genetic variants 
Across both an adrenergic and a noradrenergic phenotype, the greater the sum of plasma or urinary concentrations of metanephrine and normetanephrine, the larger the expected tumor diameter.

===Tumor localization===
====Anatomic imaging====
Anatomic imaging refers to computed tomography (CT) [CAT scan] or magnetic resonance imaging (MR) scans. These imaging modalities serve to initially locate the tumor and provide detailed information about size, morphology, and structural relation to adjacent internal structures. Traditionally, a patient presents to their physician for symptoms concerning for a pheochromocytoma, which prompts a biochemical evaluation. If the results are positive, the patient is referred for anatomic imaging with a CT or MR scan. However, as anatomic imaging becomes more readily available, patients are referred to an endocrinologist after an incidental (unanticipated finding) adrenal nodule is found on a scan ordered for another reason. For example, &quot;Patient M&quot; presents to his local emergency room for abdominal pain and a CT is ordered to rule-out appendicitis; however, the radiologist notes there is a 3.5 centimeter right adrenal mass.

While there has not been a consensus on if CT or MR is the preferred imaging modality in pheochromocytoma, each method has its associated strengths and weaknesses. As CT expose the patient to ionizing radiation, MR is preferred in children and pregnant women. Furthermore, the intravenous contrast used in CT can cause kidney damage and should therefore be avoided in patients with pre-existing damage. However, patients who struggle with being in confined spaces for extended periods of time (claustrophobia) cannot often tolerate an MR as the machine is close-ended compared to the open-ended design of a CT. When patients become anxious and begin to move in the machine, this causes motion artifact, which occurs less in CT-based images.

Compared to CT and MR, ultrasound is not a preferred imaging modality and should be avoided in the pheochromocytoma patient. However, in specific patient populations where avoid ionizing radiation is the top priority (children, pregnant women), ultrasound can be used as an adjunct method when MR may be unavailable or the patient is unable to complete the scan. Furthermore, if an acute adrenal hemorrhage is suspected in a pheochromocytoma patient, ultrasound is a quick, painless, radiation-less, and cheap modality for a &quot;first-pass&quot; before the above imaging modalities or surgery is used to confirm the diagnosis.

====Functional imaging====

The imaging modalities discussed below are for tumor characterization, confirmation of metastatic disease, and treatment planning — they are not used to discern tumor location or help the surgical team prepare for excision. For most pheochromocytoma patients, functional imaging will follow a CT or MR. If anatomic imaging only demonstrates an adrenal tumor without evidence of disease anywhere else in the body and the metanephrine levels are overtly elevated, functional imaging can be foregone in favor of prompt surgical excision. Over the last decade, there have been five functional techniques used to evaluate the pheochromocytoma patient (1) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET), commonly referred to as the PET scan, (2) iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanadine (123I-MIBG), (3) 18F-flurodihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA),(4) 68Ga-DOTA coupled somatostatin analogs (68Ga-DOTA),(5) 11C-Hydroxy ephedrine(HED-PET). From this point forward, these imaging modalities will be referred to in their abbreviated names found in parentheses.
The first functional imaging technique utilized in pheochromocytoma patients was 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. Given the compounds similar structure to the catecholamine norepinephrine (secreted by pheochromocytomas), MIBG was well-suited for uptake by most neuroendocrine tumors. Furthermore, if a patient was found to be positive on an MIBG scan, they were eligible for MIBG treatment, offering additional avenues for those with widespread metastatic disease. However, further investigation revealed that while MIBG excelled with adrenal lesions, it was far less superior in patients with extra-adrenal paragangliomas, particularly with specific genetic variants like those in the succinate dehydrogenase subunit–encoding genes (SDHx). As the positron emission tomography scans were developed, MIBG has slowly lost its favor for the pheochromocytoma patient.
Of the four above mentioned modalities, 18F-FDG PET is the most common and readily available functional imaging technique at most hospital systems, but the least-specific to neuroendocrine tumors (Image Left). In 2012, over 200 patients participated in a trial that compared the current gold standard of the time (MIBG/CT/MRI) to the novel FDG PET. Compared to its functional counterpart, FDG outperformed MIBG in detecting soft-tissue and bone metastases with higher specificity in patients with biochemically active tumors.

Following the development of FDG-PET, neuroendocrine-specific PET scans began to emerge. One of the first favorable imaging modalities was 18F-FDOPA, which demonstrated a high sensitivity in detecting head and neck paragangliomas as well as non-metastatic disease outside of the head and neck. Unfortunately, in cases of metastatic disease, particularly related to succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (&quot;SDHB)&quot; mutations, 18F-FDOPA fell inferior to the traditional FDG-PET. However, for patients with genetic variants in other pheochromocytoma-susceptibility genes (&quot;NF1, VHL, RET)&quot; 18F-FDOPA has become the preferred radiopharmaceutical agent.

The newest PET modality involves somatostatin receptor type two receptor imaging with 68Ga-DOTA analogues. Over the last decade, further research continues to indicate the superiority of this functional imaging modality in a wide range of clinical scenarios, even surpassing anatomic imaging (CT/MR) in pediatric patients with succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx) mutations. While FDOPA inconsistently detected metastatic disease, 68Ga-DOTA analogues have demonstrated superior localization of metastatic pheochromocytoma. When directly compared in one head-to-head study in 2019, 68Ga-DOTA analogues outperformed FDOPA, particularly in the detection of metastatic bone lesions. An additional benefit of the DOTA analogues is the ability for treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, which will be discussed in the treatment section below.

Also, HED-PET has shown to be an accurate tool to diagnose and rule out pheochromocytoma in complex clinical scenarios and to characterise equivocal adrenal tumours.

==Management==
===Surgery===

Surgical resection is the only curative option for pheochromocytoma as of 2019. A successful excision is a multidisciplinary effort involving the endocrinologist and the patient pre-operatively (discussed below) and the surgical team and anesthesiologist intraoperatively. Without frequent and adequate communication between all of the above-mentioned teams, a favorable outcome is much more difficult. The United States Endocrine Society 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline for pheochromocytoma recommend a laparoscopic adrenalectomy (minimally invasive technique) for most adrenal tumors, unless they are invasive or are larger than 6.0 centimeters. A 2018 systematic review suggests that laparoscopic retroperotenial adrenalectomy appears to reduce late morbidity, time to oral fluid or food intake and time to ambulation when compared to laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy, however there is uncertainty about these effects due to very low-quality evidence. For outcomes such as all-cause mortality, early morbidity, socioeconomic effects, and operative and postoperative parameter, the evidence is uncertain about the effects of either interventions over the other.

Larger tumors even for those larger than 6.0 cm can be attempted with a minimally invasive approach, but the team should be prepared to convert to an open procedure if necessary. An open procedure (traditional surgical technique) is currently preferred for extra-adrenal disease, unless the tumor is small, non-invasive, and in an easy to maneuver location. While previous data indicated the need for a minimally invasive approach with malignant and/or metastatic disease, current research indicates a successful operation is feasible and results in a shorter hospital stay. Literature within the last decade has also demonstrated that the robotic technique may be successfully utilized for adrenal tumors.

Typically, complete or total adrenalectomy is performed; however, a technique referred to as &quot;cortical-sparing&quot; can leave a remnant (piece) of the adrenal gland in hopes of avoiding life-long steroid replacement if the left and right adrenal glands need to be removed. The issue is particularly important in patients with &quot;MEN&quot; and &quot;VHL-&quot;related disease, which has a higher chance of bilateral pheochromocytomas. The risk of leaving adrenal tissue is recurrent disease (tumor comes back). A 2019 cohort study reported that despite a 13% recurrent rate in patients who underwent a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma, there was no decreased survival compared to their total adrenalectomy counterparts.

====Pre-operative management====

Arguably, the most important part of a pheochromocytoma surgical plan is an adequate pre-operative blockade. Excess catecholamines have been described as a dormant volcano, ready to erupt at any time, wreaking catastrophic havoc on the body. While an eruption can occur at any time, two of the most common triggers are anesthesia and direct tumor manipulation, making surgery one of the most dangerous times for a pheochromocytoma patient if not properly prepared. In order to help circumvent a catecholamine-crisis, the United States Endocrine Society recommends that all patients with functional (hormonally active) tumors be started on a pre-operative alpha-adrenoceptor blockade a minimum of seven days prior to surgery. There are several medication options depending on the clinical scenario, each with their own associated strengths and weaknesses.

===== Alpha blockade =====

If the patient&#x27;s blood pressure is moderately elevated, a selective, short-acting alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) is the preferred agent. However, the patient should be warned about the potential side-effect known as &quot;the first-dose phenomenon.&quot; When patients are initially exposed to one of the above agents, they may become lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseous, particularly when transferring from a seated to standing position due to a rapid decrease in blood pressure. These effects will decrease with time, but providers can try to avoid them by starting at a low-dose and slowly increasing until they reach their desired amount. In patients with uncontrolled hypertension, the non-selective alpha-1 and 2 adrenoceptor antagonist (phenoxybenzamine) should be utilized. Unfortunately, compared to the selective agents listed above, phenoxybenzamine is much more expensive and may not be readily available to some patients. Common side effects include dry mouth, nasal congestion, and impaired male ejaculation, all of which do not cease with time and may limit patient compliance. While uncommon, patients may have a hormonally-active pheochromocytoma and a normal blood pressure. One comparison from 2014 found that a small dose of a calcium-channel blocker (such as amlodipine) may be used pre-operatively in some people. This will not drastically lower the patients blood pressure and make them hypotensive, but it will assist the surgical and anesthesia teams if there is hemodynamic instability during the operation.

===== Beta blockade =====

An elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and the feeling of a racing heart (palpitations) may follow after initiating an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. If that is the case, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist is then prescribed to control the heart rate. Just as with the alpha antagonists, there are selective (beta-1) and non-selective (beta-1 and beta-2) adrenoceptor antagonists. The selective agents (atenolol, metoprolol) are preferred to the non-selective agents (propranolol). There are several (labetalol, carvedilol) combined alpha-beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. These agents should be avoided whenever possible as there is upwards of seven times more beta-adrenoceptor antagonism than alpha, which can worsen hypertension and lead to a catecholamine crisis.

===== Complications =====

Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should not be given alone in a pheochromocytoma patient — this can lead to severe consequences. In 1995, a team of physicians from London described the death of a person who had been recently diagnosed pheochromocytoma after initiation of propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker. She quickly developed a hypertensive crisis leading to shock, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and dense right hemiplegia. Despite attempts at resuscitation, the person died several days later. This complication is related to the impact that alpha and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have on blood vessels combined with the actions of catecholamines. The normal blood vessel is open, allowing for adequate blood flow. When catecholamines activate the alpha receptor, the vessel constricts (gets smaller), which results in hypertension. However, when catecholamines active the beta receptor, the blood vessel dilates (gets larger) and allows for increased blood flow, reducing the blood pressure. If a pheochromocytoma patient is only started on a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, this reverses the protective vasodilation and worsens the patient&#x27;s hypertension.

===== Controversy =====

While the pre-operative alpha and beta blockade discussed above is overwhelmingly recognized as the standard of care, particularly in the United States, there has been discussion at the international level if alpha-blockade is necessary. In 2017, a team of researchers from Germany published an observational case series that called into question the current recommendations for alpha-blockade. The study examined the intraoperative maximal systolic arterial pressure in people with and without alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and found no difference in complications between the two groups. The following year, a group from France published a similar article with a warning against waiting an entire week to begin alpha-blockade. The French researchers called for immediate surgical intervention and consideration of steps to mitigate any intraoperative catecholamine crisis. These articles resulted in rebuttals from research teams in the United States, but an international consensus has not yet been reached.

====Perioperative fluid status====
Excess catecholamines cause a decrease in the total blood volume, making a patient vulnerable to hypotension during the operation. Therefore, a high-sodium diet with adequate fluid intake should be encouraged prior to surgery. Some institutions in the United States will even admit patients the night prior to surgery for intravenous fluid replacement starting at midnight until the time of the operation. However, a small trial from 2009 reported no difference in mortality in patients treated with preoperative intravenous fluids compared to those who did not.

In a 2010 survey of 40 endocrinologists by researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, nearly all indicated the importance of preoperative volume resuscitation (having the patient take in plenty of fluids prior to surgery). However, after reviewing their patient data, over 60% of the same physicians failed to discuss salt-loading and adequate hydration. When the patients were stratified by age, those that were younger received the advice to hydrate, but older patients did not. It was hypothesized that the providers chose to forego volume repletion in the older patient population for fear of their potential comorbidities (heart failure) where excess fluid is dangerous. While there is still no recognized consensus or gold standard, providers should individualize the decision based on the patient&#x27;s perceived nutritional standing, volume status, comorbidities, and ability to self-hydrate.

====Post-operative management====

The most common post-operative complications, likely causes, and treatment options are:

&quot;Cardiovascular&quot;

# Hypertension: In the pheochromocytoma patient, postoperative hypertension could indicate incomplete tumor resection or another tumor of unknown location. However, the traditional, non-specific causes of postoperative hypertension including pain, fluid overload, and essential hypertension must also be considered. A perioperative hypertensive crisis is first treated with a 5.0 milligram (mg) intravenous bolus of phentolamine, with additional 5.0 mg dose every ten minutes until the blood pressure falls within an acceptable range. If the blood pressure is only minimally elevated, the patient can resume their alpha and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist from prior to surgery.
# Hypotension: There are several reasons a patient may have low blood pressure in the post-operative period. First and foremost, the tumor (and its abundance of catecholamines causing high blood pressure) has been removed. Furthermore, the patient may still experience the effects of their alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, which causes lower blood pressure. First-line treatment for postoperative hypotension is aggressive fluid resuscitation, which is why ensuring the patient is well-hydrated (see above) prior to surgery is so imperative. Vasopressors may be needed if the blood pressure does not respond to fluids.

&quot;Endocrine&quot;

# Hyperglycemia: Catecholamines prevent the secretion of insulin — a hormone responsible for lowering the body&#x27;s blood glucose (sugar). Blood glucose levels should be checked frequently in the perioperative period and insulin should be given as needed if levels are elevated. Following resection, tumor-related hyperglycemia is likely to resolve.
# Hypoglycemia: After the tumor is removed, insulin is no longer inhibited, which can bring the blood glucose dangerously low. Symptoms include tremor, anxiety, palpitations, sweating, altered mental status (confusion), dizziness, and blurred vision. A retrospective analysis of beta blocker found that some beta blocker use may cause people to more prone to hypoglycemia and not experience these symptoms, which could delay the diagnosis.
# Adrenal Insufficiency: Following a bilateral adrenalectomy (left and right), the patient is no longer capable of secreting the necessary hormones to keep their body functioning. Life-long steroid (hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone) oral supplementation may be required to ensure they do not develop adrenal insufficiency. When the body is stressed (during surgery), the adrenal glands naturally produce more steroids; however, if the glands have been removed, they are unable to do so. Therefore, &quot;stress-dosing&quot; steroids are required and should be started intraopertively to mimic the natural physiology of the adrenal glands. The typical regimen when post-operative adrenal insufficiency is thought to be likely:
## 50 milligram (mg) intravenous hydrocortisone in the operating room prior to anesthesia
## Repeat administration of 25–50 mg intravenous hydrocortisone every eight hours for a maximum of 72 hours (3 days) after the operation. Convert to oral replacement therapy as soon as the patient is able to take medication by mouth
## Patients should be transitioned to a normal maintenance (regular, daily) dose of steroids prior to discharge and referred to endocrinology for proper titration and management. Depending on the patient&#x27;s total body surface area, the total typical daily dose of hydrocortisone is between 15 and 25 mg daily (divided into morning and afternoon pills).
## Those who have lost both their adrenal glands will also require another steroid (mineralcorticoid replacement). The typical daily dose is between 50 and 200 micrograms of fludrocortisone
There have been many other reported complications (renal failure, heart failure, intestinal pseudo-obstruction) following tumor resection. However, the above are more likely to be encountered, which is why their management has been specifically outlined here in this article.

==Metastatic disease==
===Diagnosis and location===

Metastatic pheochromocytoma is defined as the presence of tumor cells (chromaffin tissue) where they are not normally found. Patients with a paraganglioma are more likely to develop metastases than those with a pheochromocytoma. The most common extra-adrenal sites of metastases are the lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bone. There have been several studied risk factors associated with the development of metastatic disease — while the patients genetic background plays an important role, the initial age of presentation and size of the tumor lead to negative outcomes. Of all the genetic variants, succinate dehydrogenase subunit B &quot;(SDHB)&quot; mutations have the highest rates of developing metastatic disease. Another study has reported increased mortality associated with male sex and synchronous metastases. Metastases are divided into synchronous and metachronous; those that are synchronous have developed within several months of the primary tumor, while metachronous metastases do not appear for a significant period of time.

Laparoscopic approach to the original disease, especially in big tumors, has been appointed as an important risk factor for tumoral seeding.

Despite all of the below potential treatment options, recent literature highlights that (for most patients) metastatic pheochromocytoma is slow-growing. In patients with minimal disease burden, a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach with frequent imaging to monitor disease is favorable, withholding treatment until evidence of progression is visualized.

===Treatment===
Metastatic pheochromocytoma is best managed with a multidisciplinary team of oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and endocrinologists. There are several treatment options available to patients depending on the amount and location of disease:

&quot;Surgery&quot; — Normally, the goal of surgery is complete cytoreductive surgery; leave no remnant of disease. However, with widespread metastatic disease, this is not always feasible. Therefore, a surgical debulking procedure is performed (removing as much of the cancerous tissue as possible) in order to reduce patient symptoms by removing the source of catecholamines, improve response to chemo or radionuclide therapy, or simply decrease the size of the tumor. Unfortunately, the intended relief from the procedure is often short-lived, especially if the patient has disease outside the abdomen. A 2013 study from the National Institutes of Health reported that a majority of patients with recurrent biochemical evidence of disease within one year of the operation and less than 30% continued to be biochemically free of disease after five years.

In contrast to an operation for non-metastatic disease, an open procedure may be preferred over a minimally invasive technique in order to circumvent potential tumor spread. This also aids surgical visualization and offers the best opportunity to identify and remove metastatic lymph nodes. Reports have also indicated the utility of administering a radionuclide agent like iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanadine (123I-MIBG) prior to surgery and then scanning the patient intraoperatively with a probe to detect disease that may be missed with the naked eye.

&quot;Radiation Therapy&quot; — With regard to pheochromocytoma, radiation techniques are primarily used for pain control, specifically with regards to bone metastases, local control of the disease, and to limit spinal cord compression. A multidisciplinary team from the Mayo Clinic retrospectively reviewed all of their patients who underwent external beam radiation therapy from 1973 to 2015 and reported that 94% of patients acknowledged symptomatic improvement and over 80% of patients showed no evidence of recurrent disease five years post-therapy. Another report from the same institution looked at almost two decades of patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or percutaneous ethanol injection for metastatic pheochromocytoma and reported that local control was achieved in over 85% of targeted lesions and that 92% of procedures were associated with reduced pain and/or symptoms of catecholamine excess.

&quot;Chemotherapy&quot; — The most common chemotherapy regimen for metastatic pheochromocytoma is cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine, collectively known as CVD. Response to therapy is measured by a reduction in total tumor volume as well as symptomatic relief, reported by the patient. A systematic review and meta-analysis of unstratified pheochromocytoma patients who underwent CVD therapy showed that 37% of patients had a significant reduction in tumor volume, while 40% of patients experienced lower catecholamine burden. While there was no difference in overall survival between patients whose tumors shrunk versus those without a response (no reduction in tumor burden via imaging), even in non-responders, patients reported feeling better, blood pressure was lower, and some patients were even able to undergo surgery following disease stabilization with CVD. When patients are studied by various categories, research has suggested that females are less likely to have extended survival with CVD chemotherapy compared to their male counterparts. Genetic status has been shown to greatly impact response to CVD. A team of researchers from the National Institutes of Health reported that patients with succinate dehydrogenase subunit B &quot;(SDHB)&quot; mutations are not only more likely to initially respond to CVD, but that they also experienced over 30 months of progression-free survival (time until tumor returned) with continued administration.

However, CVD is not the only proven chemotherapeutic regimen in the pheochromocytoma patient. A 2018 report demonstrated the remarkable response of two &quot;SDHB&quot; patients who failed CVD chemotherapy (disease progressed despite medication), but were then treated with temozolomide (TMZ) and had progression free survival of 13 and 27 months, indicating that TMZ can be considered as an alternative treatment regimen in those who have progressed on CVD. Several studies have since reported successful responses with TMZ, particularly in the &quot;SDHB&quot; sub-population.

&quot;Radionuclide Therapy&quot;
* Iodine-131 meta-iodobenzylguanadine (MIBG)
** As was mentioned in the functional imaging section above, MIBG is not only useful in locating the presence of metastatic disease, but also as an available treatment modality. In 2019, a multi-center phase 2 trial looked at the safety and efficacy of MIBG therapy in metastatic or unresectable (not conducive to surgery) pheochromocytoma patients and the results were promising. Median overall survival was 36.7 months and 92% of patients had at least a partial positive response (tumor shrinkage) or stable disease without progression within the first year of the study. Furthermore, over a fourth of the patients were able to decrease their anti-hypertensive medications and reported symptomatic improvement. There are several patients who are not eligible for MIBG treatment, including pregnant women (exposure to radiation is harmful to the fetus), women who are actively breast feeding, patients in renal failure, and those are who not expected to live longer than three months. As MIBG therapy can destroy the thyroid, protective medications (potassium iodide) are started prior to treatment and need to be continued for at least three weeks after therapy concludes. Associated side effects (muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting and hematologic (blood) toxicities, are common, but often minimal, and can be mitigated with slow, steady dosing.

* Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT)
** The newest of the treatment options, PRRT utilizes the 68-Ga DOTA analogues mentioned above in the functional imaging section. Treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE first demonstrated success in patients with undifferentiated neuroendocrine tumors and then trials began with metastatic pheochromocytoma patients. In 2019, Vyakaranam et al. published favourable results for their 22 patients who underwent PRRT, with partial response in 2 patients and stable disease (no progression) in the remaining 20 patients. Overall toxicity was low, with no high-grade haematological (blood) or kidney damage reported. At the end of that same year, a systemic review looked at all published articles (12) where metastatic pheochromocytoma patients underwent PRRT and found that treatment-related adverse events are minimal, with only 5 out of 102 patients choosing to voluntarily initiate treatment discontinuation. Newer reports have detailed the utility of combining 90Y-DOTATATE with the traditionally studied 177Lu analog and the various possibilities and novel treatment options these combinations will bring to the field. While the overall reported side-effects have been promising, it is important to note that a collaborative effort between the National Institutes of Health and Radboud University Medical Centre reported two unfortunate cases of rapid disease progression following a remarkable, almost complete response to PRRT. While the etiology of their recurrence is unknown, the team speculated that an elevated tumor marker (Ki-67) could be an indication of a poor response to PRRT and called for pre-PRRT assessments to include Ki-67 values to help individualize patient treatment plans.

== Prognosis ==
According to the National Cancer Institute, prognosis is defined as the likely outcome of a disease OR, the chance of recovery or a recurrence. This is an extremely difficult question when it comes to pheochromocytoma, and the answer depends on the patients genetic status, presence of metastatic disease, and the location of their primary tumor. An article about prognosis published in 2000 reported a 91% 5-year survival rate in their patient population; however, over 86% of their patients had sporadic tumors (no known genetic mutation), which commonly have low malignant potential. In 2019, a consortium of almost twenty European medical centers looked at the prognosis of malignant pheochromocytoma and the data starkly varies from the report of sporadic, single tumors, with a median survival of 6.7 years. Overall survival improved if the patient had (1) disease of the head and neck compared to abdomen, (2) less than 40 years of age, (3) and if their biochemistry was less than five times the upper reference limit of normal.

Recent literature has detailed several factors that predict accelerated progression of disease and higher mortality rates, including patients who choose to forego surgical resection of their primary tumor, larger tumors at initial presentation, older age at initial diagnosis, and a shortened time from primary tumor to presence of metastases. The actual location of the metastases can also indicate prognosis, with osseous lesions (bone) faring better than their soft-tissue (lung, liver) counterparts.

==Epidemiology==
According to the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society, the prevalence of pheochromocytoma is between 1:2,500 and 1:6,500, meaning that for every 2,500–6,500 people, there is (on average) one person with pheochromocytoma. In the United States, this equates to an annual incidence (new cases per year) of 500 to 1,600 cases. However, approximations in the early 2000s reported that upwards of 50% of pheochromocytoma diagnoses are at autopsy; therefore, the above estimations may be lower than expected. In a 50-year autopsy case series, the Mayo Clinic reviewed 54 pheochromocytoma cases between 1928–1977 and discovered that just 24% of the patients were correctly diagnosed prior to their death. Outside of the United States, several countries have documented their own epidemiological studies and compared them to what is known in North America. In the first national, epidemiological population-based study in Asia utilizing Korean National Health Insurance Service data, the prevalence of a pheochromocytoma was reported at 2.13 per 100,000 persons with an incidence of 0.18 per 100,000 person-years. This is lower than the occurrence reported from Rochester, Minnesota (0.8 per 100,000 person-years), in a study conducted from 1950 to 1979. However, the Netherlands also conducted a study using a nationwide registry and reported incidence results of 0.57 per 100,000 person-years from 2011 to 2015, which was a significant increase from their 0.37 cases per 100,000 person-years reported from 1995 to 1999. Current hypotheses for why the incidence of pheochromocytoma is growing in the Dutch population point to the advent of modern imaging evaluation and the ability to detect these tumors prior to death. While each of the above studies reported varying incidence and prevalence values, all have indicated that the average age at initial diagnosis is between the third to fifth decade of life. When younger patients are diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma, there should be a high suspicion for hereditary disease, as genetic anticipation (earlier disease onset with each generation) is associated with some mutations.

Classically, the pheochromocytoma &quot;rules of 10&quot; have been taught, particularly to medical students:
* 10% of patients have malignant disease
* 10% of patients have bilateral (both left and right adrenal glands) disease
* 10% of patients have extra-adrenal (paraganglioma) disease
* 10% of patients have inherited (familial disease)

Despite the prominence in many respected textbooks, these guidelines have since been established as inaccurate and are not used in current epidemiological discussions.

As suggested above, incidental imaging has become a major player in the diagnosis of patients with pheochromocytoma, with current estimates that 10–49% of all cases diagnosed after imaging was obtained for another reason. When an adrenal nodule (potential tumor) is discovered on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, there is a 5–10% chance the lesion is a pheochromocytoma. The incidence of adrenal tumors is found in the infographic above, with pheochromocytoma noted in yellow in the top right corner.

==History==
In 1800, an Irish physician (Charles Sugrue) penned a case report to the London Medical and Physical Journal describing the peculiar case of an 8-year-old male patient who had had seemingly random fits of pain concentrated in the abdomen accompanied by &quot;a hectic flush distinctly marked on each cheek&quot; with a &quot;constant profuse and universal perspiration.&quot; Following his death, a group of physicians performed an autopsy to determine cause of death and discovered a six-inch oblong tumor composed of an unknown &quot;yellow-ish coloured substance&quot; coming from the capsula renalis (what is now known as the adrenal gland). This would become the first known clinical description of a pheochromocytoma, but as no features of the tumor itself were described, complete credit is given to the German Felix Fraenkel, who provided a clinical and morphologic picture of this tumor. While various physicians were recognizing symptoms and treating patients, Czech biologist Alfred Kohn reported his discovery of the paraganglia system, which would later become crucial to the diagnosis of these tumors. Furthermore, he also introduced the term &quot;chromaffin,&quot; allowing pathologists to recognize tumors that arose from the adrenal gland.

In 1908, two pathologists, Henri Alezais and Felix Peyron, introduced the scientific community to &quot;paraganglioma&quot; after they discovered extra-adrenal tissue that reacted to chromium salts, which mimicked the reaction of the adrenal medulla. Just four years later, German pathologist Ludwig Pick coined the term &quot;pheochromocytoma&quot; after he observed the consistent color change in tumors associated with the adrenal medulla. Many surgeons attempted to remove these tumors over the next decade, but their patients died intraoperatively from shock. In 1926, Charles Mayo (a founder of the Mayo Clinic) became the first physician to successfully excise a pheochromocytoma. However, Mayo was likely unaware of the diagnosis prior to the operation. Not until 1929 was a pheochromocytoma recognized preoperatively. Throughout the early 1900s, the operative mortality rate for a pheochromocytoma ranged from 30 to 45%. Retrospective series have postulated that these alarmingly high death rates were due to the lack of a pre-operative blockade with alpha and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and the need for modern anesthesia practices. From this point forward, physician-scientists have been recognizing patterns in patients with pheochromocytoma and identifying genetic associations and various syndromes.

==Society and culture==
While a rare disease, there have been several references to pheochromocytoma in popular culture and the media, specifically medical television dramas. Additionally, there is a strong online patient advocacy community that works to connect patients with rare diseases and allows them to meet other individuals who are experiencing similar diagnoses and treatment strategies.

=== Zebra culture ===

In the medical community, students are often taught &quot;when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.&quot; In other words, common diagnoses are common, so healthcare professionals should first rule out what is most expected (the horses) before diving into the rare etiologies that are far less likely to be correct (the zebras). However, the symbol of the zebra has become increasingly powerful to the rare disease community and resulted in several organizations, societies, and special events (Rare Disease Day) to draw attention to the least common option sometimes being the correct diagnosis.

The National Organization for Rare Disorders is a United States–based advocacy parent organization with the goal of promoting awareness and research opportunities to cure rare diseases. Groups such as these encourage patients to become their own advocates and change agents in their healthcare decision-making processes.

=== Media ===
In July 2012, an actual pheochromocytoma patient, Tannis Brown, former vice-president of the PheoPara Troopers, was featured on the Discovery Fit &amp; Health Network program &quot;Diagnosis: Dead or Alive.&quot; The show highlighted her personal struggle with misdiagnosed disease as many physicians felt her episodic headaches and hypertension (high blood pressure) were related to stress.

In the seventh and eighth seasons of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy,&quot; series regular Henry has a Von Hippel-Lindau &quot;(VHL)&quot; mutation that has resulted in a pheochromocytoma. The story arc was met with mixed opinions from the rare disease community. The executive director of the VHL Alliance was happy with the portrayal of a VHL patient in mainstream media, but pointed out that of the four scripts she knew of with a VHL patient, three involved a pheochromocytoma, which occurs in less than a fifth of all VHL patients.

A case of pheochromocytoma was featured in the first episode of season 2 of &quot;House, M.D.&quot;. Dr. House and his team are tasked with diagnosing and treating an inmate on death row. Although the patient has a violent history of homicide, Dr. House suspects that his episodic rage and aggression may be caused by an adrenaline secreting tumor. Dr. House is able to locate the tumor and diagnoses the patient with pheochromocytoma. Dr. Foreman, one of the doctors, attempts to appeal the inmate&#x27;s death penalty on the basis that he was unable to control his actions due to his tumor. This kind of legal defense is rarely successful, however.
==Etymology==
1920s: from phaeochrome (another term for chromaffin), from Greek phaios &#x27;dusky&#x27; + khrōma &#x27;color&#x27;, + -cyte.

<text>Michael &quot;Dodo&quot; Marmarosa (December 12, 1925 – September 17, 2002) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger.

Originating in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Marmarosa became a professional musician in his mid-teens, and toured with several major big bands, including those led by Tommy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, and Artie Shaw into the mid-1940s. He moved to Los Angeles in 1945, where he became increasingly interested and involved in the emerging bebop scene. During his time on the West Coast, he recorded in small groups with leading bebop and swing musicians, including Howard McGhee, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young, as well as leading his own bands.

Marmarosa returned to Pittsburgh for health reasons in 1948. He began performing much less frequently, and had a presence only locally for around a decade. Friends and fellow musicians had commented from an early stage that Marmarosa was an unusual character. His mental stability was probably affected by being beaten into a coma when in his teens, by a short-lived marriage followed by permanent separation from his children, and by a traumatic period in the army. He made comeback recordings in the early 1960s, but soon retreated to Pittsburgh, where he played occasionally into the early 1970s. From then until his death three decades later, he lived with family and in veterans&#x27; hospitals.

==Early life==
Marmarosa was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 12, 1925. He had &quot;Italian working-class parents&quot; – Joseph and Carmella. He was the middle of three children, between sisters Audrey and Doris, and grew up in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Marmarosa attended Peabody High School. He received the uncomplimentary nickname &quot;Dodo&quot; as a child because of his large head, short body, and bird-like nose.

Although he had stated an interest in playing the trumpet, Marmarosa&#x27;s parents persuaded him to take up the piano, which he began at the age of 9. He received classical music lessons, but was influenced by the jazz playing of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa&#x27;s elder, introduced him to their music. Marmarosa practiced a lot, until his left and right hands were equally strong.

==Later life and career==

===1941–50===
Marmarosa began his professional career around 1941, joining the Johnnie &quot;Scat&quot; Davis orchestra at the age of 15 or 16. He was first mentioned in the national jazz press the following year, appearing in &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine for his playing at a jam session. After touring, the Davis orchestra disbanded, so Marmarosa and others then joined Gene Krupa around the end of 1942. After one 1943 Krupa performance in Philadelphia, Marmarosa was beaten into a coma by sailors who accused him of draft dodging. According to clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, who was also attacked by the men, &quot;Dodo was always a little off but he seemed different after that beating. The head injury didn&#x27;t affect his playing, but I think it created psychological problems for him.&quot;

After Krupa&#x27;s orchestra broke up in the middle of 1943, Marmarosa played in Ted Fio Rito&#x27;s band for at least a month that summer. He then moved to Charlie Barnet&#x27;s big band, where he stayed from October 1943 to March 1944. Marmarosa&#x27;s recording debut was with Barnet in 1943; they recorded &quot;The Moose&quot;, a track described by Gunther Schuller as &quot;a veritable masterpiece&quot; on which the 17-year-old pianist played an original blend of nascent bebop and Count Basie-style minimalism. Marmarosa recorded some trio tracks with Krupa and DeFranco in 1944. From April to October of that year he was with Tommy Dorsey, including for the orchestra&#x27;s appearance in the MGM film &quot;Thrill of a Romance&quot;. A Dorsey biographer indicated that the pianist was dismissed because the bandleader did not care for the modernistic facets of his playing. Marmarosa soon joined clarinetist Artie Shaw, with whom he stayed until November 1945, as part of a big band and Shaw&#x27;s small band, the Gramercy Five.

From the early 1940s Marmarosa had searched for and experimented with advanced progressive forms of jazz, and had become increasingly attracted to bebop after meeting and jamming with the leaders of that new movement, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. In 1945 Marmarosa moved to Los Angeles. He was pianist in March of the following year for Parker&#x27;s first recordings for Dial Records. Two of the tracks recorded, &quot;Ornithology&quot; and &quot;Yardbird Suite&quot;, have been included in the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Marmarosa recorded extensively as a sideman in the period 1945–47, in both bebop and swing contexts. Leaders of these sessions included Wardell Gray, Lionel Hampton, Mel Tormé, Willie Smith, Lester Young, and, with Marmarosa as house pianist for Atomic Records, Slim Gaillard and Barney Kessel. With a few exceptions, however, Marmarosa only rarely played in public with the leaders whose studio recordings he appeared on during his time on the West Coast. Between the frequent recording sessions, he played &quot;in big bands (especially Boyd Raeburn and Tommy Pederson), at jazz concerts, as a soloist in nightclubs [...] or jamming after hours.&quot; Raeburn&#x27;s orchestra was a progressive group that used &quot;modern arrangements seeking to bridge the gap between bop and advanced European music&quot;.

Marmarosa made his first recordings as leader in 1946, with trio tracks that included Ray Brown on bass and Jackie Mills on drums, and in a quartet with saxophonist Lucky Thompson added. He also recorded his only vocal track, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got News for You&quot;, in the same year. In 1947 Marmarosa led a trio session for Dial with Harry Babasin on cello and Jackie Mills on drums; these were the first pizzicato jazz cello recordings. In the same year, he featured in some of Gene Norman&#x27;s Just Jazz concerts, and was given &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine&#x27;s New Star (piano) award.

According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, &quot;Dodo was the most dedicated of players. He practiced an incredible amount of hours, often all day long. He wouldn&#x27;t stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever.&quot; At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that &quot;Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn&#x27;t able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe.&quot;

In the spring of 1948 Marmarosa returned to Pittsburgh because of illness. He toured again with &quot;Scat&quot; Davis (April – July 1949) and Shaw (September – November 1949). He left Shaw&#x27;s band for the final time during one concert after they had twice played Shaw&#x27;s hit, &quot;Frenesí&quot;, Marmarosa had threatened to leave if Shaw called for it again, and the leader had done so after the audience requested a third playing. Shaw reported that Marmarosa &quot;was gentle and fragile, [...and] never learned to deal with the world of a musician.&quot; The pianist returned to Pittsburgh in 1950, signed &quot;a term contract&quot; with Savoy Records, and recorded four trio sides for them in July, but the quality did not match his earlier playing.

===1951–59===
For around a decade, Marmarosa was much less active as a musician. Shaw and DeFranco raised the idea of psychiatric treatment, but the former was rebuffed by Marmarosa himself, and the latter by the pianist&#x27;s parents: &quot;They were not reconciled to his needing professional help. They were from the old school, they saw it as a stigma. I got into a big argument about it with his father. He really blew up.&quot;

In 1952, two years after marrying, Marmarosa moved with his wife and their two daughters to California. The marriage was short lived, and he again returned to his parents&#x27; home in Pittsburgh in the fall of that year. His ex-wife remarried and asked him to allow her to change the children&#x27;s names in exchange for not having to pay her any more money; following the advice of his parents, he signed the documents. A friend of his later stated that never seeing his children again &quot;was the great blight of his life. It tore him apart&quot;. Another friend commented more generally that, &quot;After the marriage broke up, he seemed to lose the spark, the drive he once had&quot;.

A tour of a few months in Charlie Spivak&#x27;s band in 1953 preceded Marmarosa being drafted into the army the following year. This exacerbated his problems: several months in a Veteran Administration hospital preceded his discharge, at which point he was in a poor psychological condition. Back in Pittsburgh, where he played locally from March 1956, Marmarosa continued to be erratic, sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time, and giving his money away: &quot;It was like he was on the road to self-destruction&quot;, commented trumpeter Danny Conn. Amateur recordings from the pianist&#x27;s concerts in Pittsburgh in 1958 were released four decades later by Uptown Records.

===1960–2002===
Marmarosa departed for California by car in 1960, but problems with the vehicle halted him in Chicago. Promoter Joe Segal organized an Argo Records session for him there, but Marmarosa departed suddenly and the recording was delayed until the following year. The resultant trio music from two days in May was released as &quot;Dodo&#x27;s Back!&quot; in 1962. Leonard Feather described it as &quot;required listening for anyone with a serious interest in the history of modern jazz piano&quot;, but it failed to gain Marmarosa more than a brief resurgence of interest. He made his final studio recordings in 1962. One album from these, &quot;Jug &amp; Dodo&quot;, contained trio and quartet tracks, with saxophonist Gene Ammons; it was released on Prestige Records more than a decade later. The other, in a quartet with trumpeter Bill Hardman, was released in 1988. Segal commented that Marmarosa &quot;didn&#x27;t talk much, was very mild-mannered. He just drank an awful lot, shot and a beer all day long. It would&#x27;ve put nine out of ten people under the table, but he was still walking around.&quot; The pianist shuttled between Chicago and Pittsburgh for a time, then settled again in the latter.

Marmarosa continued to perform in Pittsburgh, albeit irregularly. Around 1963, DeFranco dropped by; he recalled that the pianist &quot;would play brilliantly for half a tune, then just stop and walk away. He didn&#x27;t even know who I was&quot;. Marmarosa&#x27;s last performance in public has been dated variously as occurring in 1968 or the early-to-mid 1970s. Diabetes contributed to his permanent retirement. &quot;Even the resurgence of interest in bebop in the 1970s and 80s did not bring him back to national attention&quot;, reported &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

For the rest of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris&#x27; family and in a veterans&#x27; hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa&#x27;s family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his mental problems, and suggested that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family&#x27;s basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa died of a heart attack on September 17, 2002, in a veterans&#x27; hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.

==Playing style and influence==
Pianist Dick Katz wrote that, &quot;In the opinion of many, Dodo Marmarosa was the most gifted of all the pianists who figured in the bebop saga. Blessed with a beautiful legato touch and a fluid technique, he developed an original style, which [...] blended perfectly with the bop idiom, as well as with earlier styles. He combined advanced chordal and scalar elements with graceful rhythmic phrasing.&quot;

In some of his 1944 playing, Marmarosa was progressively bebop-directed, employing melodies derived from the harmony and varying the rhythmic positioning of accents; soon after, he added more space to his playing, using shorter sequences of notes than typical in bebop. Jazz critic Marc Myers, in comparing Marmarosa with other pianists of the early bebop period, observed that he was less aggressive than Bud Powell, and more expressive and complex than Al Haig, and that he &quot;had a punctuating, full-keyboard approach, developing ideas in the middle and widening out to express them.&quot;

Critic and musician Brian Priestley wrote that &quot;What was so distinctive about Dodo&#x27;s work was partly his harmonic sense and knowledge of the additional notes [...in bebop.] Many pianists were trying to find ways to voice these satisfactorily in full chording, but none did so as pleasingly or as fluently as Marmarosa. Partly it was also the way he alternated between employing his hands together and in opposition to each other, and allied to this was his unusual time feeling.&quot;

By the time of his 1960s recordings, Marmarosa had a more relaxed playing style. Biographers commented that &quot;his even, classically derived articulation had given way to a more rhythmically pronounced, jazz-oriented playing, and, above all, his musical personality seemed still more determined and coherent.&quot;

Pianist Cecil Taylor commented in 1961 that &quot;The first modern pianist who made any impression on me was Dodo Marmarosa, with Charlie Barnet.&quot; Marmarosa also encouraged DeFranco to take up bebop.

<doc id="277094" wikidata="Q278773" url="?curid=277094" title="Devil's advocate">
<text>The  (Latin for Devil&#x27;s advocate) is a former official position within the Catholic Church, the Promoter of the Faith: one who &quot;argued against the canonization (sainthood) of a candidate to uncover any character flaws or misrepresentation of the evidence favoring canonization&quot;.

In common parlance, the phrase &quot;playing devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; describes a situation where someone, given a certain point of view, takes a position they do not necessarily agree with (or simply an alternative position from the accepted norm), for the sake of debate or to explore the thought further using valid reasoning that both disagrees with the subject at hand and proves their own point valid. Despite being medieval in origin, this idiomatic expression is one of the most popular present-day English idioms used to express the concept of arguing against something without actually being committed to the contrary view. Playing devil&#x27;s advocate is considered a form of the Socratic method.

==Origin and history==
During the canonization process employed by the Catholic Church, the &#x27;Promoter of the Faith&#x27; (), popularly known as the Devil&#x27;s advocate (), was a canon lawyer appointed by Church authorities to argue against the canonization of a candidate. It was this person&#x27;s job to take a skeptical view of the candidate&#x27;s character, to look for holes in the evidence, to argue that any miracles attributed to the candidate were fraudulent, and so on. The Devil&#x27;s advocate opposed &#x27;God&#x27;s advocate&#x27; (; also known as the &#x27;Promoter of the Cause&#x27;), whose task was to make the argument in favor of canonization. During the investigation of a cause, this task is now performed by the &#x27;Promoter of Justice&#x27; (), who is in charge of examining the accuracy of the inquiry on the saintliness of the candidate. The Promoter of the Faith remains a figure in the Congregation of the Causes of Saints and is also known as the Prelate Theologian.

The office was established in 1587 during the reign of Pope Sixtus V. The first formal mention of such an officer is found in the canonization of St Lawrence Justinian under Pope Leo X (15131521). Pope John Paul II reduced the power and changed the role of the office in 1983. In cases of controversy, the Vatican may still seek to solicit the testimony of critics of a candidate for canonization. One notable example of this was in 2003, when author Christopher Hitchens, an atheist and outspoken critic of Mother Teresa, was interviewed as part of her beatification hearings.

==Effectiveness==

Psychologist writes that inauthentic dissent (assigning someone to act as a Devil&#x27;s advocate) is considerably less effective in improving group decision-making than authentic dissent. She also writes that inauthentic dissent can cause people to become more entrenched in their original beliefs, the opposite of the intended purpose e.g. in businesses that use this technique.

<text>Multiple endocrine [[neoplasia]] (abbreviated MEN) is a condition which encompasses several distinct syndromes featuring tumors of endocrine glands, each with its own characteristic pattern. In some cases, the tumors are malignant, in others, benign. Benign or malignant tumors of nonendocrine tissues occur as components of some of these tumor syndromes.

MEN syndromes are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders.

==Presentation==
===Related conditions===

Although not officially categorized as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, Von Hippel–Lindau disease and Carney complex are two other autosomal dominant endocrine tumor syndromes with features that overlap the clinical features of the MEN syndromes. Although not transmitted in the germline, McCune–Albright syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by endocrine neoplastic features involving endocrine glands that overlap with those involved in MEN1 or MEN2.

==Comparison==
Percentages in the table below refer to the percentage of people with the MEN type who develop the neoplasia type.

*- of patients with MEN1 and gastrinoma

FMTC = familial medullary thyroid cancer
MEN 2B is sometimes known as MEN 3 and the designation varies by institution (c.f. www.ClinicalReview.com).
Although a variety of additional eponyms have been proposed for MEN2B (e.g. Williams-Pollock syndrome, Gorlin-Vickers syndrome, and Wagenmann–Froboese syndrome), none ever gained sufficient traction to merit continued use and, indeed, are all but abandoned in the medical literature. Another early report was Schimke &quot;et al.&quot; in 1968.

OMIM also includes a fourth form of multiple endocrine neoplasia (&quot;MEN4&quot;), associated with CDKN1B. The presentation is believed to overlap that of MEN1 and MEN2.

== Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) ==

=== The &quot;MEN1&quot; gene ===
The &quot;MEN1&quot; gene consists of ten exons, spanning about 10 kb, and encodes a 610 amino acid protein named menin. The first exon and the last part of exon 10 are not translated. The main transcript of 2.8 kb has been described in a large variety of human tissues (pancreas, thymus, adrenal glands, thyroid, testis, leukocytes, heart, brain, lung, muscle, small intestine, liver, and kidney); an additional transcript of approximately 4 kb has been detected in pancreas and thymus, suggesting tissue-specific alternative splicing.

=== The Menin Protein ===
Menin is a 610 amino acid (67Kda) nuclear protein, highly conserved from mouse (98%), rat (97%) and, more distantly, zebrafish (75%) and &quot;Drosophila&quot; (47%) (47-51). Human and mouse MEN1 amino acid sequences share 95.8% identity and 98.4% similarity. Analysis of menin amino acid sequence did not reveal homologies to any other known human or mammalian protein, sequence motif, or signal peptide. The absence of significant homology to any other protein complicates efforts to elucidate the functions of menin.

=== Pathophysiology ===
&quot;MEN1&quot; follows Knudson’s “two-hit” model for tumor suppressor gene carcinogenesis (30). The first hit is a heterozygous MEN1 germline mutation, inherited from one parent (familial cases) or developed in an early embryonic stage (sporadic cases) and present in all cells at birth. The second hit is a MEN1 somatic mutation, usually a large deletion, that occurs in the predisposed endocrine cell as loss of the remaining wild-type allele and gives cells the survival advantage needed for tumor development.

=== Mnemonic ===
A useful mnemonic to remember the associated neoplasias is below:

MEN I (3 Ps) - Pituitary, Parathyroid, Pancreatic&lt;br&gt;
MEN IIa (2Ps, 1M) - Pheochromocytoma, Parathyroid, Medullary Thyroid Ca&lt;br&gt;
MEN IIb (1P, 2Ms) - Pheochromocytoma, Medullary Thyroid Ca, Marfanoid habitus/mucosal neuroma

=== &quot;MEN1&quot; mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia patients and clinical genetics ===
&quot;MEN1&quot; gene mutations can be identified in 70–95% of MEN1 patients and in about 20% of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism cases. Almost all patients are heterozygous for mutations. One affected family has been identified with individuals both homozygous and heterozygous for MEN1 mutations. In this family, there was no difference in disease history between the homozygous and heterozygous mutation carriers.

50% of patients develop signs and symptoms by 20 years of age and more than 95% have symptoms by 40 years of age. There is significant intra- and inter-familial variability in the age of onset, the severity of disease, and tumor types. Despite numerous studies, no genotype-phenotype correlations have been established, suggesting that unknown genetic and environmental modifiers are involved in the expression of the MEN1 phenotype.

=== Manifestations ===
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary endocrine cancer syndrome characterized primarily by tumors of the parathyroid glands (95% of cases), endocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tract (30–80% of cases), and anterior pituitary (15–90% of cases). Other endocrine and non-endocrine neoplasms including adrenocortical and thyroid tumors, visceral and cutaneous lipomas, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas and collagenomas, and thymic, gastric, and bronchial carcinoids also occur. The phenotype of MEN1 is broad, and over 20 different combinations of endocrine and non-endocrine manifestations have been described. MEN1 should be suspected in patients with an endocrinopathy of two of the three characteristic affected organs, or with an endocrinopathy of one of these organs plus a first-degree relative affected by MEN1 syndrome.

MEN1 patients usually have a family history of MEN1. Inheritance is autosomal dominant; any affected parent has a 50% chance to transmit the disease to his or her progeny. MEN1 gene mutations can be identified in 70–95% of MEN1 patients.

Many endocrine tumors in MEN1 are benign and cause symptoms by overproduction of hormones or local mass effects, while other MEN1 tumors are associated with an elevated risk for malignancy. About one-third of patients affected with MEN1 will die early from MEN1-related cancer or associated malignancy. Entero-pancreatic gastrinomas and thymic and bronchial carcinoids are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Consequently, the average age of death in untreated individuals with MEN1 is significantly lower (55.4 years for men and 46.8 years for women) than that of the general population.

=== Recommended cancer surveillance ===
A recommend surveillance program for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 has been suggested by the International Guidelines for Diagnosis and Therapy of MEN syndromes group.

== History ==

In 1903 Erdheim described the case of an acromegalic patient with a pituitary adenoma and three enlarged parathyroid glands.

In 1953 Underdahl &quot;et al.&quot; reported a case series of 8 patients with a syndrome of pituitary, parathyroid, and pancreatic islet adenomas.

In 1954 Wermer noted that this syndrome was transmitted as a dominant trait.

In 1959 Hazard &quot;et al.&quot; described medullary (solid) thyroid carcinoma.

In 1961 Sipple described a combination of a pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma and parathyroid adenoma.

In 1966 Williams &quot;et al.&quot; described the combination of mucosal neuromas, pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma.

In 1968 Steiner &quot;et al.&quot; introduced the term &quot;multiple endocrine neoplasias&quot; (MEN) to describe disorders featuring combinations of endocrine tumors and proposed the terms &#x27;Wermer syndrome&#x27; for MEN 1 and &#x27;Sipple syndrome&#x27; for MEN 2.

In 1974 Sizemore &quot;et al.&quot; showed that the MEN 2 category included two groups of patients with MTC and pheochromocytoma: one with parathyroid disease and a normal appearance (MEN 2A) and the other without parathyroid disease but with mucosal neuromas and mesodermal abnormalities (MEN 2B).

In 1988 the MEN1 locus was assigned to Chromosome 11 (11q13).

In 1993 mutations in the RET oncogene were shown to be the cause of MEN 2A by Lois Mulligan, working in the laboratory of Bruce Ponder in Cambridge.

In 1998 the MEN1 gene was cloned.

==Terminology==
The older names, &quot;multiple endocrine adenomas&quot; and &quot;multiple endocrine adenomatosis&quot; (MEA), have been replaced by the current terminology.

The term multiple endocrine neoplasias are used when two or more endocrine tumor types, known to occur as a part of one of the defined MEN syndromes, occurs in a single patient and there is evidence for either a causative mutation or hereditary transmission. The presence of two or more tumor types in a single patient does not automatically designate that individual as having MEN because there is a small statistical chance that the development of two &quot;sporadic&quot; tumors that occur in one of the MEN syndromes could occur by chance.

The term &quot;multiple endocrine neoplasia&quot; was introduced in 1968, but descriptions of the condition date back to 1903.

<text>A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms which are correlated with each other and often associated with a particular disease or disorder. The word derives from the Greek σύνδρομον, meaning &quot;concurrence&quot;. When a syndrome is paired with a definite cause this becomes a disease. In some instances, a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words &quot;syndrome&quot;, &quot;disease&quot;, and &quot;disorder&quot; end up being used interchangeably for them. This substitution of terminology often confuses the reality and meaning of medical diagnoses. This is especially true of inherited syndromes. About one third of all phenotypes that are listed in OMIM are described as dysmorphic, which usually refers to the facial gestalt. For example, Down syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen–Tawil syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the &quot;syndrome&quot; nomenclature. In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; another medical syndrome named as premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms.

If an underlying genetic cause is suspected but not known, a condition may be referred to as a genetic association (often just &quot;association&quot; in context). By definition, an association indicates that the collection of signs and symptoms occurs in combination more frequently than would be likely by chance alone.

Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians that discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture. Such eponymous syndrome names are examples of medical eponyms. Recently, there has been a shift towards naming conditions descriptively (by symptoms or underlying cause) rather than eponymously, but the eponymous syndrome names often persist in common usage.

The defining of syndromes has sometimes been termed syndromology, but it is usually not a separate discipline from nosology and differential diagnosis generally, which inherently involve pattern recognition (both sentient and automated) and differentiation among overlapping sets of signs and symptoms. Teratology (dysmorphology) by its nature involves the defining of congenital syndromes that may include birth defects (pathoanatomy), dysmetabolism (pathophysiology), and neurodevelopmental disorders.

== Subsyndromal ==
When there are a number of symptoms suggesting a particular disease or condition but does not meet the defined criteria used to make a diagnosis of that disease or condition. This can be a bit subjective because it is ultimately up to the clinician to make the diagnosis. This could be because it has not advanced to the level or passed a threshold or just similar symptoms cause by other issues. Subclinical is synonymous since one of its definitions is &quot;where some criteria are met but not enough to achieve clinical status&quot;; but subclinical is not always interchangeable since it can also mean &quot;not detectable or producing effects that are not detectable by the usual clinical tests&quot;; i.e., asymptomatic.

==Usage==

===General medicine===
In medicine, a broad definition of syndrome is used, which describes a collection of symptoms and findings without necessarily tying them to a single identifiable pathogenesis. Examples of infectious syndromes include encephalitis and hepatitis, which can both have several different infectious causes. The more specific definition employed in medical genetics describes a subset of all medical syndromes.

====History====
Early texts by physicians noted the symptoms of various maladies and introduced diagnoses based upon those symptoms. For example, Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (1025) describes diagnosing pleurisy by its symptoms, including chronic fever, cough, shooting pains, and labored breathing. The 17th century doctor Thomas Sydenham likewise approached diagnoses based upon collections of symptoms.

===Psychiatry and psychopathology===
Psychiatric syndromes often called &quot;psychopathological syndromes&quot; (psychopathology refers both to psychic dysfunctions occurring in mental disorders, and the study of the origin, diagnosis, development, and treatment of mental disorders).

In Russia those psychopathological syndromes are used in modern clinical practice and described in psychiatric literature in the details: asthenic syndrome, obsessive syndrome, emotional syndromes (for example, manic syndrome, depressive syndrome), Cotard&#x27;s syndrome, catatonic syndrome, hebephrenic syndrome, delusional and hallucinatory syndromes (for example, paranoid syndrome, paranoid-hallucinatory syndrome, Kandinsky-Clérambault&#x27;s syndrome also known as syndrome of psychic automatism, hallucinosis), paraphrenic syndrome, psychopathic syndromes (includes all personality disorders), clouding of consciousness syndromes (for example, twilight clouding of consciousness, amential syndrome also known as amentia, delirious syndrome, stunned consciousness syndrome, oneiroid syndrome), hysteric syndrome, neurotic syndrome, Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome, hypochondriacal syndrome, paranoiac syndrome, senestopathic syndrome, encephalopathic syndrome.

Some examples of psychopathological syndromes used in modern Germany are psychoorganic syndrome, depressive syndrome, paranoid-hallucinatory syndrome, obsessive-compulsive syndrome, autonomic syndrome, hostility syndrome, manic syndrome, apathy syndrome.

Münchausen syndrome, Ganser syndrome, neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome, olfactory reference syndrome are also well-known.

====History====
The most important psychopathological syndromes were classified into three groups ranked in order of severity by German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856—1926). The first group, which includes the mild disorders, consists of five syndromes: emotional, paranoid, hysterical, delirious, and impulsive. The second, intermediate, group includes two syndromes: schizophrenic syndrome and speech-hallucinatory syndrome. The third includes the most severe disorders, and consists of three syndromes: epileptic, oligophrenic and dementia. In Kraepelin&#x27;s era, epilepsy was viewed as a mental illness; Karl Jaspers also considered &quot;genuine epilepsy&quot; a &quot;psychosis&quot;, and described &quot;the three major psychoses&quot; as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and manic-depressive illness.

===Medical genetics===
In the field of medical genetics, the term &quot;syndrome&quot; is traditionally only used when the underlying genetic cause is known. Thus, trisomy 21 is commonly known as Down syndrome.

Until 2005, CHARGE syndrome was most frequently referred to as &quot;CHARGE association&quot;. When the major causative gene (&quot;CHD7&quot;) for the condition was discovered, the name was changed. The consensus underlying cause of VACTERL association has not been determined, and thus it is not commonly referred to as a &quot;syndrome&quot;.

===Other fields===

In biology, &quot;syndrome&quot; is used in a more general sense to describe characteristic sets of features in various contexts. Examples include behavioral syndromes, as well as pollination syndromes and seed dispersal syndromes.

In orbital mechanics and astronomy, Kessler syndrome refers to the effect where the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.

In quantum error correction theory syndromes correspond to errors in code words which are determined with syndrome measurements, which only collapse the state on an error state, so that the error can be corrected without affecting the quantum information stored in the code words.

==Naming==
There is no set common convention for the naming of newly identified syndromes. In the past, syndromes were often named after the physician or scientist who identified and described the condition in an initial publication. These are referred to as &quot;eponymous syndromes&quot;. In some cases, diseases are named after the patient who initially presents with symptoms, or their home town (Stockholm syndrome). There have been isolated cases of patients being eager to have their syndromes named after them, while their physicians are hesitant. When a syndrome is named after a person, there is some difference of opinion as to whether it should take the possessive form or not (e.g. Down syndrome vs. Down&#x27;s syndrome). North American usage has tended to favor the non-possessive form, while European references often use the possessive. A 2009 study demonstrated a trend away from the possessive form in Europe in medical literature from 1970 through 2008.

==Underlying cause==
Even in syndromes with no known etiology, the presence of the associated symptoms with a statistically improbable correlation normally leads the researchers to hypothesize that there exists an unknown underlying cause for all the described symptoms.

<doc id="277109" wikidata="Q5319218" url="?curid=277109" title="Dynkin diagram">
<text>In the mathematical field of Lie theory, a Dynkin diagram, named for Eugene Dynkin, is a type of graph with some edges doubled or tripled (drawn as a double or triple line). Dynkin diagrams arise in the classification of semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, in the classification of Weyl groups and other finite reflection groups, and in other contexts. Various properties of the Dynkin diagram (such as whether it contains multiple edges, or its symmetries) correspond to important features of the associated Lie algebra.


The term &quot;Dynkin diagram&quot; can be ambiguous. In some cases, Dynkin diagrams are assumed to be directed, in which case they correspond to root systems and semi-simple Lie algebras, while in other cases they are assumed to be undirected, in which case they correspond to Weyl groups. In this article, &quot;Dynkin diagram&quot; means &quot;directed&quot; Dynkin diagram, and &quot;undirected&quot; Dynkin diagrams will be explicitly so named.

== Classification of semisimple Lie algebras ==
The fundamental interest in Dynkin diagrams is that they classify semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields. One classifies such Lie algebras via their root system, which can be represented by a Dynkin diagram. One then classifies Dynkin diagrams according to the constraints they must satisfy, as described below.

Dropping the direction on the graph edges corresponds to replacing a root system by the finite reflection group it generates, the so-called Weyl group, and thus undirected Dynkin diagrams classify Weyl groups.

They have the following correspondence for the Lie algebras associated to classical groups over the complex numbers:
* formula_1: formula_2, the special linear Lie algebra.
* formula_3: formula_4, the odd-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra.
* formula_5: formula_6, the symplectic Lie algebra.
* formula_7: formula_8, the even-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra (formula_9).
For the exceptional groups, the names for the Lie algebra and the associated Dynkin diagram coincide.

== Related classifications ==

Dynkin diagrams can be interpreted as classifying many distinct, related objects, and the notation &quot;A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, ...&quot; is used to refer to &quot;all&quot; such interpretations, depending on context; this ambiguity can be confusing.

The central classification is that a simple Lie algebra has a root system, to which is associated an (oriented) Dynkin diagram; all three of these may be referred to as B&quot;n&quot;, for instance.

The &quot;un&quot;oriented Dynkin diagram is a form of Coxeter diagram, and corresponds to the Weyl group, which is the finite reflection group associated to the root system. Thus B&quot;n&quot; may refer to the unoriented diagram (a special kind of Coxeter diagram), the Weyl group (a concrete reflection group), or the abstract Coxeter group.

Although the Weyl group is abstractly isomorphic to the Coxeter group, a specific isomorphism depends on an ordered choice of simple roots. Likewise, while Dynkin diagram notation is standardized, Coxeter diagram and group notation is varied and sometimes agrees with Dynkin diagram notation and sometimes does not.

Lastly, &quot;sometimes&quot; associated objects are referred to by the same notation, though this cannot always be done regularly. Examples include:
* The root lattice generated by the root system, as in the E8 lattice. This is naturally defined, but not one-to-one – for example, A2 and G2 both generate the hexagonal lattice.
* An associated polytope – for example Gosset 421 polytope may be referred to as &quot;the E8 polytope&quot;, as its vertices are derived from the E8 root system and it has the E8 Coxeter group as symmetry group.
* An associated quadratic form or manifold – for example, the E8 manifold has intersection form given by the E8 lattice.
These latter notations are mostly used for objects associated with exceptional diagrams – objects associated to the regular diagrams (A, B, C, D) instead have traditional names.

The index (the &quot;n&quot;) equals to the number of nodes in the diagram, the number of simple roots in a basis, the dimension of the root lattice and span of the root system, the number of generators of the Coxeter group, and the rank of the Lie algebra. However, &quot;n&quot; does not equal the dimension of the defining module (a fundamental representation) of the Lie algebra – the index on the Dynkin diagram should not be confused with the index on the Lie algebra. For example, formula_10 corresponds to formula_11 which naturally acts on 9-dimensional space, but has rank 4 as a Lie algebra.

The simply laced Dynkin diagrams, those with no multiple edges (A, D, E) classify many further mathematical objects; see discussion at ADE classification.

=== Example: A2 ===
For example, the symbol formula_12 may refer to:
* The Dynkin diagram with 2 connected nodes, , which may also be interpreted as a Coxeter diagram.
* The root system with 2 simple roots at a formula_13 (120 degree) angle.
* The Lie algebra formula_14 of rank 2.
* The Weyl group of symmetries of the roots (reflections in the hyperplane orthogonal to the roots), isomorphic to the symmetric group formula_15 (of order 6).
* The abstract Coxeter group, presented by generators and relations, formula_16

== Construction from root systems ==

Consider a root system, assumed to be reduced and integral (or &quot;crystallographic&quot;). In many applications, this root system will arise from a semisimple Lie algebra. Let formula_17 be a set of positive simple roots. We then construct a diagram from formula_17 as follows. Form a graph with one vertex for each element of formula_17. Then insert edges between each pair of vertices according to the following recipe. If the roots corresponding to the two vertices are orthogonal, there is no edge between the vertices. If the angle between the two roots is 120 degrees, we put one edge between the vertices. If the angle is 135 degrees, we put two edges, and if the angle is 150 degrees, we put three edges. (These four cases exhaust all possible angles between pairs of positive simple roots.) Finally, if there are any edges between a given pair of vertices, we decorate them with an arrow pointing from the vertex corresponding to the longer root to the vertex corresponding to the shorter one. (The arrow is omitted if the roots have the same length.) Thinking of the arrow as a &quot;greater than&quot; sign makes it clear which way the arrow should go. Dynkin diagrams lead to a classification of root systems. The angles and length ratios between roots are related. Thus, the edges for non-orthogonal roots may alternatively be described as one edge for a length ratio of 1, two edges for a length ratio of formula_20, and three edges for a length ratio of formula_21. (There are no edges when the roots are orthogonal, regardless of the length ratio.)

In the formula_12 root system, shown at right, the roots labeled formula_23 and formula_24 form a base. Since these two roots are at angle of 120 degrees (with a length ratio of 1), the Dynkin diagram consists of two vertices connected by a single edge: .

== Constraints ==
Dynkin diagrams must satisfy certain constraints; these are essentially those satisfied by finite Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams, together with an additional crystallographic constraint.

== Connection with Coxeter diagrams ==
Dynkin diagrams are closely related to Coxeter diagrams of finite Coxeter groups, and the terminology is often conflated.

Dynkin diagrams differ from Coxeter diagrams of finite groups in two important respects:
;Partly directed: Dynkin diagrams are &quot;partly directed&quot; – any multiple edge (in Coxeter terms, labeled with &quot;4&quot; or above) has a direction (an arrow pointing from one node to the other); thus Dynkin diagrams have &quot;more&quot; data than the underlying Coxeter diagram (undirected graph).
:At the level of root systems the direction corresponds to pointing towards the shorter vector; edges labeled &quot;3&quot; have no direction because the corresponding vectors must have equal length. (Caution: Some authors reverse this convention, with the arrow pointing towards the longer vector.)
;Crystallographic restriction: Dynkin diagrams must satisfy an additional restriction, namely that the only allowable edge labels are 2, 3, 4, and 6, a restriction not shared by Coxeter diagrams, so not every Coxeter diagram of a finite group comes from a Dynkin diagram.
:At the level of root systems this corresponds to the crystallographic restriction theorem, as the roots form a lattice.
A further difference, which is only stylistic, is that Dynkin diagrams are conventionally drawn with double or triple edges between nodes (for &quot;p&quot; = 4, 6), rather than an edge labeled with &quot;p&quot;.

The term &quot;Dynkin diagram&quot; at times refers to the &quot;directed&quot; graph, at times to the &quot;undirected&quot; graph. For precision, in this article &quot;Dynkin diagram&quot; will mean &quot;directed,&quot; and the underlying undirected graph will be called an &quot;undirected Dynkin diagram&quot;. Then Dynkin diagrams and Coxeter diagrams may be related as follows:

By this is meant that Coxeter diagrams of finite groups correspond to point groups generated by reflections, while Dynkin diagrams must satisfy an additional restriction corresponding to the crystallographic restriction theorem, and that Coxeter diagrams are undirected, while Dynkin diagrams are (partly) directed.

The corresponding mathematical objects classified by the diagrams are:

The blank in the upper right, corresponding to directed graphs with underlying undirected graph any Coxeter diagram (of a finite group), can be defined formally, but is little-discussed, and does not appear to admit a simple interpretation in terms of mathematical objects of interest.

There are natural maps down – from Dynkin diagrams to undirected Dynkin diagrams; respectively, from root systems to the associated Weyl groups – and right – from undirected Dynkin diagrams to Coxeter diagrams; respectively from Weyl groups to finite Coxeter groups.

The down map is onto (by definition) but not one-to-one, as the &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; diagrams map to the same undirected diagram, with the resulting Coxeter diagram and Weyl group thus sometimes denoted &quot;BC&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

The right map is simply an inclusion – undirected Dynkin diagrams are special cases of Coxeter diagrams, and Weyl groups are special cases of finite Coxeter groups – and is not onto, as not every Coxeter diagram is an undirected Dynkin diagram (the missed diagrams being &quot;H&quot;3, &quot;H&quot;4 and &quot;I&quot;2(&quot;p&quot;) for &quot;p&quot; = 5 &quot;p&quot; ≥ 7), and correspondingly not every finite Coxeter group is a Weyl group.

==Isomorphisms==

Dynkin diagrams are conventionally numbered so that the list is non-redundant: formula_25 for formula_26 formula_27 for formula_28 formula_29 for formula_30 formula_31 for formula_32 and formula_33 starting at formula_34 The families can however be defined for lower &quot;n,&quot; yielding exceptional isomorphisms of diagrams, and corresponding exceptional isomorphisms of Lie algebras and associated Lie groups.

Trivially, one can start the families at formula_35 or formula_36 which are all then isomorphic as there is a unique empty diagram and a unique 1-node diagram. The other isomorphisms of connected Dynkin diagrams are:
* formula_37
* formula_38
* formula_39
* formula_40
* formula_41
* formula_42
* formula_43

These isomorphisms correspond to isomorphism of simple and semisimple Lie algebras, which also correspond to certain isomorphisms of Lie group forms of these. They also add context to the En family.

== Automorphisms ==
In addition to isomorphism between different diagrams, some diagrams also have self-isomorphisms or &quot;automorphisms&quot;. Diagram automorphisms correspond to outer automorphisms of the Lie algebra, meaning that the outer automorphism group Out = Aut/Inn equals the group of diagram automorphisms.

The diagrams that have non-trivial automorphisms are A&quot;n&quot; (formula_44), D&quot;n&quot; (formula_44), and E6. In all these cases except for D4, there is a single non-trivial automorphism (Out = &quot;C&quot;2, the cyclic group of order 2), while for D4, the automorphism group is the symmetric group on three letters (&quot;S&quot;3, order 6) – this phenomenon is known as &quot;triality&quot;. It happens that all these diagram automorphisms can be realized as Euclidean symmetries of how the diagrams are conventionally drawn in the plane, but this is just an artifact of how they are drawn, and not intrinsic structure.
For A&quot;n&quot;, the diagram automorphism is reversing the diagram, which is a line. The nodes of the diagram index the fundamental weights, which (for A&quot;n&quot;−1) are formula_46 for formula_47, and the diagram automorphism corresponds to the duality formula_48 Realized as the Lie algebra formula_49 the outer automorphism can be expressed as negative transpose, formula_50, which is how the dual representation acts.
For D&quot;n&quot;, the diagram automorphism is switching the two nodes at the end of the Y, and corresponds to switching the two chiral spin representations. Realized as the Lie algebra formula_51 the outer automorphism can be expressed as conjugation by a matrix in O(2&quot;n&quot;) with determinant −1. When &quot;n&quot; = 3, one has formula_52 so their automorphisms agree, while formula_53 is disconnected, and the automorphism corresponds to switching the two nodes.

For D4, the fundamental representation is isomorphic to the two spin representations, and the resulting symmetric group on three letter (&quot;S&quot;3, or alternatively the dihedral group of order 6, Dih3) corresponds both to automorphisms of the Lie algebra and automorphisms of the diagram.
The automorphism group of E6 corresponds to reversing the diagram, and can be expressed using Jordan algebras.

Disconnected diagrams, which correspond to &quot;semi&quot;simple Lie algebras, may have automorphisms from exchanging components of the diagram.
In positive characteristic there are additional &quot;diagram automorphisms&quot; – roughly speaking, in characteristic &quot;p&quot; one is sometimes allowed to ignore the arrow on bonds of multiplicity &quot;p&quot; in the Dynkin diagram when taking diagram automorphisms. Thus in characteristic 2 there is an order 2 automorphism of formula_54 and of F4, while in characteristic 3 there is an order 2 automorphism of G2. But doesn&#x27;t apply in all circumstances: for example, such automorphisms need not arise as automorphisms of the corresponding algebraic group, but rather on the level of points valued in a finite field.

===Construction of Lie groups via diagram automorphisms===
Diagram automorphisms in turn yield additional Lie groups and groups of Lie type, which are of central importance in the classification of finite simple groups.

The Chevalley group construction of Lie groups in terms of their Dynkin diagram does not yield some of the classical groups, namely the unitary groups and the non-split orthogonal groups. The Steinberg groups construct the unitary groups 2A&quot;n&quot;, while the other orthogonal groups are constructed as 2D&quot;n&quot;, where in both cases this refers to combining a diagram automorphism with a field automorphism. This also yields additional exotic Lie groups 2E6 and 3D4, the latter only defined over fields with an order 3 automorphism.

The additional diagram automorphisms in positive characteristic yield the Suzuki–Ree groups, 2B2, 2F4, and 2G2.

===Folding===
A (simply-laced) Dynkin diagram (finite or affine) that has a symmetry (satisfying one condition, below) can be quotiented by the symmetry, yielding a new, generally multiply laced diagram, with the process called folding (due to most symmetries being 2-fold). At the level of Lie algebras, this corresponds to taking the invariant subalgebra under the outer automorphism group, and the process can be defined purely with reference to root systems, without using diagrams. Further, every multiply laced diagram (finite or infinite) can be obtained by folding a simply-laced diagram.

The one condition on the automorphism for folding to be possible is that distinct nodes of the graph in the same orbit (under the automorphism) must not be connected by an edge; at the level of root systems, roots in the same orbit must be orthogonal. At the level of diagrams, this is necessary as otherwise the quotient diagram will have a loop, due to identifying two nodes but having an edge between them, and loops are not allowed in Dynkin diagrams.

The nodes and edges of the quotient (&quot;folded&quot;) diagram are the orbits of nodes and edges of the original diagram; the edges are single unless two incident edges map to the same edge (notably at nodes of valence greater than 2) – a &quot;branch point&quot; of the map, in which case the weight is the number of incident edges, and the arrow points &quot;towards&quot; the node at which they are incident – &quot;the branch point maps to the non-homogeneous point&quot;. For example, in D4 folding to G2, the edge in G2 points from the class of the 3 outer nodes (valence 1), to the class of the central node (valence 3).

The foldings of finite diagrams are:
* formula_55
:(The automorphism of A2&quot;n&quot; does not yield a folding because the middle two nodes are connected by an edge, but in the same orbit.)
* formula_56
* formula_57 (if quotienting by the full group or a 3-cycle, in addition to formula_58 in 3 different ways, if quotienting by an involution)
* formula_59

Similar foldings exist for affine diagrams, including:
* formula_60
* formula_61
* formula_62
* formula_63

The notion of foldings can also be applied more generally to Coxeter diagrams – notably, one can generalize allowable quotients of Dynkin diagrams to Hn and I2(&quot;p&quot;). Geometrically this corresponds to projections of uniform polytopes. Notably, any simply laced Dynkin diagram can be folded to I2(&quot;h&quot;), where &quot;h&quot; is the Coxeter number, which corresponds geometrically to projection to the Coxeter plane.

Folding can be applied to reduce questions about (semisimple) Lie algebras to questions about simply-laced ones, together with an automorphism, which may be simpler than treating multiply laced algebras directly; this can be done in constructing the semisimple Lie algebras, for instance. See Math Overflow: Folding by Automorphisms for further discussion.

== Other maps of diagrams ==
Some additional maps of diagrams have meaningful interpretations, as detailed below. However, not all maps of root systems arise as maps of diagrams.

For example, there are two inclusions of root systems of A2 in G2, either as the six long roots or the six short roots. However, the nodes in the G2 diagram correspond to one long root and one short root, while the nodes in the A2 diagram correspond to roots of equal length, and thus this map of root systems cannot be expressed as a map of the diagrams.

Some inclusions of root systems can be expressed as one diagram being an induced subgraph of another, meaning &quot;a subset of the nodes, with all edges between them&quot;. This is because eliminating a node from a Dynkin diagram corresponds to removing a simple root from a root system, which yields a root system of rank one lower. By contrast, removing an edge (or changing the multiplicity of an edge) while leaving the nodes unchanged corresponds to changing the angles between roots, which cannot be done without changing the entire root system. Thus, one can meaningfully remove nodes, but not edges. Removing a node from a connected diagram may yield a connected diagram (simple Lie algebra), if the node is a leaf, or a disconnected diagram (semisimple but not simple Lie algebra), with either two or three components (the latter for D&quot;n&quot; and E&quot;n&quot;). At the level of Lie algebras, these inclusions correspond to sub-Lie algebras.

The maximal subgraphs are as follows; subgraphs related by a diagram automorphism are labeled &quot;conjugate&quot;:
* A&quot;n&quot;+1: A&quot;n&quot;, in 2 conjugate ways.
* B&quot;n&quot;+1: A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;.
* C&quot;n&quot;+1: A&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;.
* D&quot;n&quot;+1: A&quot;n&quot; (2 conjugate ways), D&quot;n&quot;.
* E&quot;n&quot;+1: A&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;, E&quot;n&quot;.
** For E6, two of these coincide: formula_64 and are conjugate.
* F4: B3, C3.
* G2: A1, in 2 non-conjugate ways (as a long root or a short root).

Finally, duality of diagrams corresponds to reversing the direction of arrows, if any: Bn and Cn are dual, while F4, and G2 are self-dual, as are the simply-laced ADE diagrams.

== Simply laced ==

A Dynkin diagram with no multiple edges is called simply laced, as are the corresponding Lie algebra and Lie group. These are the formula_65 diagrams, and phenomena that such diagrams classify are referred to as an ADE classification. In this case the Dynkin diagrams exactly coincide with Coxeter diagrams, as there are no multiple edges.

== Satake diagrams ==

Dynkin diagrams classify &quot;complex&quot; semisimple Lie algebras. Real semisimple Lie algebras can be classified as real forms of complex semisimple Lie algebras, and these are classified by Satake diagrams, which are obtained from the Dynkin diagram by labeling some vertices black (filled), and connecting some other vertices in pairs by arrows, according to certain rules.

== History ==

Dynkin diagrams are named for Eugene Dynkin, who used them in two papers (1946, 1947) simplifying the classification of semisimple Lie algebras; see . When Dynkin left the Soviet Union in 1976, which was at the time considered tantamount to treason, Soviet mathematicians were directed to refer to &quot;diagrams of simple roots&quot; rather than use his name.

Undirected graphs had been used earlier by Coxeter (1934) to classify reflection groups, where the nodes corresponded to simple reflections; the graphs were then used (with length information) by Witt (1941) in reference to root systems, with the nodes corresponding to simple roots, as they are used today. Dynkin then used them in 1946 and 1947, acknowledging Coxeter and Witt in his 1947 paper.

== Conventions ==

Dynkin diagrams have been drawn in a number of ways; the convention followed here is common, with 180° angles on nodes of valence 2, 120° angles on the valence 3 node of D&quot;n&quot;, and 90°/90°/180° angles on the valence 3 node of E&quot;n&quot;, with multiplicity indicated by 1, 2, or 3 parallel edges, and root length indicated by drawing an arrow on the edge for orientation. Beyond simplicity, a further benefit of this convention is that diagram automorphisms are realized by Euclidean isometries of the diagrams.

Alternative convention include writing a number by the edge to indicate multiplicity (commonly used in Coxeter diagrams), darkening nodes to indicate root length, or using 120° angles on valence 2 nodes to make the nodes more distinct.

There are also conventions about numbering the nodes. The most common modern convention had developed by the 1960s and is illustrated in .

== Rank 2 Dynkin diagrams ==

Dynkin diagrams are equivalent to generalized Cartan matrices, as shown in this table of rank 2 Dynkin diagrams with their corresponding Cartan matrices.

For rank 2, the Cartan matrix form is:
: formula_66

A multi-edged diagram corresponds to the nondiagonal Cartan matrix elements , with the number of edges drawn equal to , and an arrow pointing towards nonunity elements.

A generalized Cartan matrix is a square matrix formula_67 such that:
# For diagonal entries, formula_68.
# For non-diagonal entries, formula_69.
# formula_70 if and only if formula_71

The Cartan matrix determines whether the group is of finite type (if it is a positive-definite matrix, i.e. all eigenvalues are positive), of affine type (if it is not positive-definite but positive-semidefinite, i.e. all eigenvalues are non-negative), or of indefinite type. The indefinite type often is further subdivided, for example a Coxeter group is Lorentzian if it has one negative eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues are positive. Moreover, multiple sources refer to hyberbolic Coxeter groups, but there are several non-equivalent definitions for this term. In the discussion below, hyperbolic Coxeter groups are a special case of Lorentzian, satisfying an extra condition. For rank 2, all negative determinant Cartan matrices correspond to hyperbolic Coxeter group. But in general, most negative determinant matrices are neither hyperbolic nor Lorentzian.

Finite branches have formula_72, and affine branches (with a zero determinant) have .

== Finite Dynkin diagrams ==

== Affine Dynkin diagrams ==
There are extensions of Dynkin diagrams, namely the affine Dynkin diagrams; these classify Cartan matrices of affine Lie algebras. These are classified in , specifically listed on . Affine diagrams are denoted as formula_73 or formula_74 where &quot;X&quot; is the letter of the corresponding finite diagram, and the exponent depends on which series of affine diagrams they are in. The first of these, formula_75 are most common, and are called extended Dynkin diagrams and denoted with a tilde, and also sometimes marked with a + superscript. as in formula_76. The (2) and (3) series are called twisted affine diagrams.

See Dynkin diagram generator for diagrams.

Here are all of the Dynkin graphs for affine groups up to 10 nodes. Extended Dynkin graphs are given as the &quot;~&quot; families, the same as the finite graphs above, with one node added. Other directed-graph variations are given with a superscript value (2) or (3), representing foldings of higher order groups. These are categorized as &quot;Twisted affine&quot; diagrams.

== Hyperbolic and higher Dynkin diagrams ==

The set of compact and noncompact hyperbolic Dynkin graphs has been enumerated. All rank 3 hyperbolic graphs are compact. Compact hyperbolic Dynkin diagrams exist up to rank 5, and noncompact hyperbolic graphs exist up to rank 10.

===Compact hyperbolic Dynkin diagrams===
===Noncompact (over-extended) forms===
Some notations used in theoretical physics, such as M-theory, use a &quot;+&quot; superscript for extended groups instead of a &quot;~&quot; and this allows higher extensions groups to be defined. 
# Extended Dynkin diagrams (affine) are given &quot;+&quot; and represent one added node. (Same as &quot;~&quot;)
# Over-extended Dynkin diagrams (hyperbolic) are given &quot;^&quot; or &quot;++&quot; and represent two added nodes.
# Very-extended Dynkin diagrams with 3 nodes added are given &quot;+++&quot;.

=== 238 Hyperbolic groups (compact and noncompact) ===
The 238 hyperbolic groups (compact and noncompact) of rank formula_77 are named as formula_78 and listed as formula_79 for each rank.

===Very-extended===
Very-extended groups are Lorentz groups, defined by adding three nodes to the finite groups. The E8, E7, E6, F4, and G2 offer six series ending as very-extended groups. Other extended series not shown can be defined from An, Bn, Cn, and Dn, as different series for each &quot;n&quot;. The determinant of the associated Cartan matrix determine where the series changes from finite (positive) to affine (zero) to a noncompact hyperbolic group (negative), and ending as a Lorentz group that can be defined with the use of one time-like dimension, and is used in M theory.

<text>Howard James Kaloogian (born December 30, 1959) is an American politician and a former Republican member of the California State Assembly, having served in the State Assembly for the 74th district from 1994 to 2000. After leaving office, he was active in the 2003 California recall, and unsuccessfully ran in 2004 for the United States Senate and in a special election in 2006 to the United States House of Representatives.

==Biography==
Kaloogian grew up in Michigan, of Armenian-born parents. Kaloogian earned a Bachelor&#x27;s from Michigan State University and a J.D. degree from Pepperdine University School of Law. During 1988–1996, he was an estate attorney. He got his start in politics at the suggestion of Bill Morrow, after Morrow read a strongly worded letter Kaloogian wrote to the editor of the San Diego &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; purporting to correct a reader&#x27;s misleading interpretation of the preamble to the Constitution of the United States.

From 1994–2000, Kaloogian was a member of the California Assembly, representing California District 74, which covers portions of northern San Diego County. He won his seat in the 1994 legislative elections, with 61% of the votes counted. He endorsed Senator Phil Gramm&#x27;s presidential bid in 1995.

Kaloogian was twice re-elected to the Assembly. He recorded an unchanged majority, 61%, in the 1996 legislative election and was re-elected again in the 1998 election, where his share of the vote fell to 57%.

In 2003, Kaloogian became the chairman of the Recall Gray Davis Committee, dedicated to the ousting of governor Gray Davis.

Kaloogian is a founder and co-chairman of Move America Forward, a political action group. Kaloogian considers President Ronald Reagan to be one of his political heroes. Kaloogian serves on the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project and was the Chairman of the Defend Reagan Project, which campaigned in 2003 for CBS to drop a docudrama about Reagan, &quot;The Reagans&quot;. The campaign was successful, as CBS did not show the mini-series, but handed it off to Showtime.

In 2004 Kaloogian ran for the U.S. Senate from California but lost the Republican primary with 11% of the vote, placing him 3rd out of 11 candidates. He also ran unsuccessfully in the special election to fill the opening created by the resignation of disgraced Congressman Duke Cunningham in California&#x27;s 50th Congressional District.

In 2008 Kaloogian chaired an Anti-Barack Obama political action committee called &quot;Our country deserves better&quot;. He appeared in a video ad for that group.

Howard Kaloogian is married to Martha Lynn, and has a step-son.

==2006 campaign for Congress==
Kaloogian ran in the special election to fill the opening in California&#x27;s 50th District to the House of Representatives caused by the resignation of disgraced former Congressman Duke Cunningham. In the special elections where the top vote-getter from each party moves to the next round, Kaloogian finished a distant third among the Republican candidates. The next round took place at the same time as the primary for the term that commenced January 3, 2007. On April 17, Kaloogian announced his withdrawal from the primary for the next congressional term. State Senator Bill Morrow, who was running against Kaloogian, challenged an implied endorsement by him of Kaloogian on Kaloogian&#x27;s website.

===Altered photo and Other Controversies===

During the 2006 campaign, an image showing &quot;a busy urban street scene&quot; in Baghdad was posted on Kaloogian&#x27;s web site. The image was removed after bloggers at the Daily Kos noted that the image was actually of Istanbul. Kaloogian later said using the photo was &quot;a stupid mistake&quot;.

Kaloogian was involved with another controversy with Lowell Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Fuselier, &quot;Business Law Group PC&quot; and &quot;Ambassador Property Management,&quot; Vista, CA, and both of Kaloogian and Fuselier, LLP law firm in Carlsbad, CA. NBC San Diego News reports that Howard Kaloogian and Bob Fuselier stole over $150,000 of their client&#x27;s money. Bob Fuselier admitted to cashing a check made out to their client and withdrawing $60,000. Fuselier refused to disclose where the rest of the money was being held. A criminal complaint was filed with the Carlsbad Police Department. Kaloogian and Fuselier convinced the DA and the Superior Court of California, San Diego, North County Division, that they had a right to keep their client&#x27;s money for charges in a separate and unconnected case. Kaloogian &amp; Fuselier won by default. The client reports that Kaloogian &amp; Fuselier told so many lies, papered him and the courts over with so many false allegations and trumped up lawsuits to keep the money, that he ended up defaulting.

<text>A tangible investment is something physical that you can touch. It is an investment in a tangible, hard or real asset or personal property. This contrasts with financial investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other financial instruments.

Some assets are held purely for their ability to appreciate, such as collectibles, while others are held for the income they generate while they depreciate, such as equipment held for lease. Others exhibit a combination of properties, appreciating in market value while depreciating in book value, such as rental real estate. Timberland exhibits depletion of timber combined with appreciation of land. Other assets’ values fluctuate with supply and demand, such as commodities, which are liquid investments unlike most other tangible investments. 

These various properties, together with the lack of correlation to traditional asset class values, make tangible investments a means of reducing overall investment risk through diversification.

== Types ==
All of the following are tangible investments:
* Businesses
* Real estate and land
* Infrastructure as an asset class (as opposed to traditional government-funded infrastructure)
* Commodities and natural resources such as industrial and precious metals and minerals, oil, agricultural commodities, fish, livestock and forestry
* Collectibles of all kinds, including:
** Antiques and ancient artifacts
** Fine art
** Postage stamps (see philatelic investment)
** Coins (see coin collecting) and banknotes
** Autographs and historic documents
** Memorabilia, such as political, celebrity, and sports memorabilia
** Firearms and militaria
** Trading cards
** Jewelry and timepieces
** Fine wines and spirits
** Classic cars
** Rare books
** Musical instruments
** Toys

<doc id="277125" wikidata="Q1300745" url="?curid=277125" title="Superrationality">
<text>In economics and game theory, a participant is considered to have superrationality (or renormalized rationality) if they have perfect rationality (and thus maximize their utility) but assume that all other players are superrational too and that a superrational individual will always come up with the same strategy as any other superrational thinker when facing the same problem. Applying this definition, a superrational player who assumes they are playing against a superrational opponent in a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma will cooperate while a rationally self-interested player would defect. 

This decision rule is not a mainstream model in game theory and was suggested by Douglas Hofstadter in his article, series, and book &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; as an alternative type of rational decision making different from the widely accepted game-theoretic one. Hofstadter provided this definition: &quot;Superrational thinkers, by recursive definition, include in their calculations the fact that they are in a group of superrational thinkers.&quot; 

Unlike the supposed &quot;reciprocating human&quot;, the superrational thinker will not always play the equilibrium that maximizes the total social utility and is thus not a philanthropist.

==Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma==
The idea of superrationality is that two logical thinkers analyzing the same problem will think of the same correct answer. For example, if two people are both good at math and both have been given the same complicated problem to do, both will get the same right answer. In math, knowing that the two answers are going to be the same doesn&#x27;t change the value of the problem, but in the game theory, knowing that the answer will be the same might change the answer itself.

The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is usually framed in terms of jail sentences for criminals, but it can be stated equally well with cash prizes instead. Two players are each given the choice to cooperate (C) or to defect (D). The players choose without knowing what the other is going to do. If both cooperate, each will get $100. If they both defect, they each get $1. If one cooperates and the other defects, then the defecting player gets $150, while the cooperating player gets nothing.

The four outcomes and the payoff to each player are listed below.

One valid way for the players to reason is as follows:

# Assuming the other player defects, if I cooperate I get nothing and if I defect I get a dollar.
# Assuming the other player cooperates, I get $100 if I cooperate and $150 if I defect.
# So whatever the other player does, my payoff is increased by defecting, if only by one dollar.

The conclusion is that the rational thing to do is to defect. This type of reasoning defines game-theoretic rationality and two game-theoretic rational players playing this game both defect and receive a dollar each.

Superrationality is an alternative method of reasoning. First, it is assumed that the answer to a symmetric problem will be the same for all the superrational players. Thus the sameness is taken into account &quot;before&quot; knowing what the strategy will be. The strategy is found by maximizing the payoff to each player, assuming that they all use the same strategy. Since the superrational player knows that the other superrational player will do the same thing, whatever that might be, there are only two choices for two superrational players. Both will cooperate or both will defect depending on the value of the superrational answer. Thus the two superrational players will both cooperate since this answer maximizes their payoff. Two superrational players playing this game will each walk away with $100.

A superrational player playing against a game-theoretic rational player will defect, since the strategy only assumes that the superrational players will agree.

Although standard game theory assumes common knowledge of rationality, it does so in a different way. The game-theoretic analysis maximizes payoffs by allowing each player to change strategies independently of the others, even though in the end, it assumes that the answer in a symmetric game will be the same for all. This is the definition of a game-theoretic Nash equilibrium, which defines a stable strategy as one where no player can improve the payoffs by unilaterally changing course. The superrational equilibrium in a symmetric game is one where all the players&#x27; strategies are forced to be the same before the maximization step. (Although there is no agreed-upon extension of the concept of superrationality to asymmetric games, see for more.)

Some argue that superrationality implies a kind of magical thinking in which each player supposes that their decision to cooperate will cause the other player to cooperate, even though there is no communication. Hofstadter points out that the concept of &quot;choice&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply when the player&#x27;s goal is to figure something out, and that the decision does not cause the other player to cooperate, but rather the same logic leads to the same answer independent of communication or cause and effect. This debate is over whether it is reasonable for human beings to act in a superrational manner, not over what superrationality means, and is similar to arguments about whether it is reasonable for humans to act in a &#x27;rational&#x27; manner, as described by game theory (wherein they can figure out what other players will or have done by asking themselves, what would I do if I was them, and applying backward induction and iterated elimination of dominated strategies).

==Probabilistic strategies==
For simplicity, the foregoing account of superrationality ignored mixed strategies: the possibility that the best choice could be to flip a coin, or more generally to choose different outcomes with some probability. In the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, it is superrational to cooperate with probability 1 even when mixed strategies are admitted, because the average payoff when one player cooperates and the other defects are the same as when both cooperate and so defecting increases the risk of both defecting, which decreases the expected payout. But in some cases, the superrational strategy is mixed.

For example, if the payoffs in are as follows:

:: CC – $100/$100
:: CD – $0/$1,000,000
:: DC – $1,000,000/$0
:: DD – $1/$1

So that defecting has a huge reward, the superrational strategy is defecting with a probability of 499,900/999,899 or a little over 49.995%. As the reward increases to infinity, the probability only approaches 1/2 further, and the losses for adopting the simpler strategy of 1/2 (which are already minimal) approach 0. In a less extreme example, if the payoff for one cooperator and one defector was $400 and $0, respectively, the superrational mixed strategy world be defecting with probability 100/299 or about 1/3.

In similar situations with more players, using a randomising device can be essential. One example discussed by Hofstadter is the platonia dilemma: an eccentric trillionaire contacts 20 people, and tells them that if one and only one of them send him or her a telegram (assumed to cost nothing) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If they receive more than one telegram or none at all, no one will get any money, and communication between players is forbidden. In this situation, the superrational thing to do (if it is known that all 20 are superrational) is to send a telegram with probability p=1/20—that is, each recipient essentially rolls a 20-sided die and only sends a telegram if it comes up &quot;1&quot;. This maximizes the probability that exactly one telegram is received.

Notice though that this is not the solution in the conventional game-theoretical analysis. Twenty game-theoretically rational players would each send in telegrams and therefore receive nothing. This is because sending telegrams is the dominant strategy; if an individual player sends telegrams they have a chance of receiving money, but if they send no telegrams they cannot get anything. (If all telegrams were guaranteed to arrive, they would only send one, and no one would expect to get any money).

==Asymmetric games==
Academic work extending the concept of superrationality to asymmetric games is still incipient.

One such work, developed by Ghislain Fourny, proposes a decision algorithm which, when executed by a set of agents, will lead to what he called a Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium:

This algorithm can informally be understood as the following sequence of steps:

# Determine, given what choices might be available to the players, what outcome &quot;would&quot; be reached if they each executed the maximin decision rule. Call this outcome .
# Eliminate from consideration any outcome that does not Pareto dominate .
# Repeat steps 1 and 2 until either there is only one outcome left, or more outcomes are eliminated.

The outcome that survives this elimination process, if any, will be the PTE.

==Formalizations and related concepts==
The question of whether to cooperate in a one-shot Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma in some circumstances has also come up in the decision theory literature sparked by Newcomb&#x27;s problem. Causal decision theory suggests that superrationality is irrational, while evidential decision theory endorses lines of reasoning similar to superrationality and recommends cooperation in a Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma against a similar opponent.

Program equilibrium has been proposed as a mechanistic model of superrationality.

<text>James Wesley &quot;Bubber&quot; Miley (April 3, 1903 – May 20, 1932) was an American early jazz trumpet and cornet player, specializing in the use of the plunger mute.

==Early life (1903–1923)==
Miley was born in Aiken, South Carolina, United States, into a musical family. At the age of six, he and his family moved to New York City where, as a child, he occasionally sang for money on the streets, and later, at the age of 14, studied to play the trombone and cornet.

In 1920, after having served in the Navy for 18 months, he joined a jazz formation named the Carolina Five, and remained a member for the next three years, playing small clubs and boat rides all around New York City. After leaving the band at the age of 19, Miley briefly toured the Southern States with a show titled &quot;The Sunny South&quot;, and then joined Mamie Smith&#x27;s Jazz Hounds, replacing trumpeter Johnny Dunn. They regularly performed in clubs around New York City and Chicago. While touring in Chicago, he heard King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band playing and was captivated by Oliver&#x27;s use of mutes. Soon Miley found his own voice by combining the straight and plunger mute with a growling sound.

==Duke Ellington years (1923–1929)==
Miley&#x27;s talent and unique style were soon noticed in New York&#x27;s jazz scene by Duke Ellington who wanted him to jump in for trumpeter Arthur Whetsel. According to saxophonist Otto Hardwick, Ellington&#x27;s band members had to shanghai Miley into joining them for his first performance, at the &quot;Hollywood on Broadway&quot; in 1923. At the time, Ellington&#x27;s Washingtonians were formally led by Elmer Snowden, but Ellington, who factually had already been running the formation, also took over its official leadership a few months later.

Miley&#x27;s collaboration with Ellington has secured his place in jazz history. Early Ellington hits, such as &quot;Black and Tan Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; the Voom Voom&quot;, &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-Oo&quot;, &quot;The Mooche&quot;, and &quot;Creole Love Call&quot;, prominently featured Miley&#x27;s solo work and were thematically inspired by his melodic ideas, which he, in turn, often borrowed from Baptist hymns sung in his church, such as Stephen Adams&#x27; &quot;Holy City&quot;. With fellow band member, trombonist Joe &quot;Tricky Sam&quot; Nanton, Miley developed the &quot;wah-wah&quot; sound that characterized Ellington&#x27;s early &quot;jungle music&quot; style. Many jazz critics consider Miley&#x27;s musical contributions to be integral to Ellington&#x27;s early success during the time they performed in the Kentucky Club and Cotton Club.

In 1924, while working with Ellington, Miley also recorded &quot;Down In The Mouth Blues&quot; and &quot;Lenox Avenue Shuffle&quot;, as a duo named The Texas Blues Destroyers, with Alvin Ray on reed organ. They managed to trick three different record companies into recording the same two songs, both composed by Ray.

In interviews, former co-musicians such as Ellington, Nanton, Hardwick, and Harry Carney spoke fondly of Bubber Miley&#x27;s carefree character and joie de vivre, exemplified in numerous anecdotes. On the other hand, they also mention his unreliability, and problems with alcohol abuse. Miley&#x27;s lifestyle eventually led to his breaking up with Ellington&#x27;s band in 1929, but his influence on the Duke Ellington Orchestra lasted far longer. His legacy lived on in trumpeters such as Cootie Williams and later Ray Nance, who both were able to adopt Miley&#x27;s style when required.

==Final years (1929–1932)==
After leaving Ellington&#x27;s orchestra in 1929, Miley joined Noble Sissle&#x27;s Orchestra for a one-month tour to Paris, France. After returning to New York, he recorded with groups led by King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Hoagy Carmichael, Zutty Singleton and with Leo Reisman&#x27;s society dance band. Miley also performed live with Reisman, albeit being the only African American in Reisman&#x27;s all-white formation, either dressed in an usher&#x27;s uniform and off the bandstand, or hidden from view by a screen. In 1930, he recorded six songs for Victor Records under the name Bubber Miley and his Mileage Makers, a formation of thirteen musicians including clarinetist Buster Bailey.

Miley&#x27;s alcoholism terminally affected his life. On May 20, 1932, at the age of 29, he died of tuberculosis, on Welfare Island, now Roosevelt Island, in New York City. Miley lived just a little longer than his contemporary, jazz cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, whose life was also cut short due to alcohol abuse.

<doc id="277135" wikidata="Q7170444" url="?curid=277135" title="Person on business from Porlock">
<text>The &quot;person on business from Porlock&quot; was an unwelcome visitor to Samuel Taylor Coleridge during his composition of the poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; in 1797. Coleridge claimed to have perceived the entire course of the poem in a dream (possibly an opium-induced haze), but was interrupted by this visitor who came &quot;on business from Porlock&quot; while in the process of writing it. &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, only 54 lines long, was never completed. Thus &quot;person from Porlock&quot;, &quot;man from Porlock&quot;, or just &quot;Porlock&quot; are literary allusions to unwanted intruders who disrupt inspired creativity.

==Story==
In 1797, Coleridge was living at Nether Stowey, a village in the foothills of the Quantocks. However, due to ill health, he had &quot;retired to a lonely farm house between Porlock and Lynton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire&quot;. It is unclear whether the interruption took place at Culbone Parsonage or at Ash Farm. He described the incident in his first publication of the poem, writing about himself in the third person:

==Speculations==
In &quot;Coleridge, Opium and &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;&quot;, University of Chicago Press, 1953, Elisabeth Schneider suggested that this prologue, as well as the person from Porlock, was fictional and intended as a credible explanation of the poem&#x27;s seemingly fragmentary state as published. The poet Stevie Smith also suggested this view in one of her own poems, saying &quot;the truth is I think, he was already stuck&quot;.

<text>Amanda Winn-Lee (née Winn) is an American semi-retired voice actress, ADR director and script writer who works mainly on anime dubs. She was the voice of Mimiru in &quot;.hack//SIGN&quot;, Rally Vincent in &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot;, Yohko Mano in &quot;Devil Hunter Yohko&quot;, Momiji Kushinada in &quot;Blue Seed&quot;, Yukiko Amagi in &quot;Persona 4&quot;, and was featured most notably as Rei Ayanami of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; fame. Aside from voice work she quite often handles production, ADR direction and the scripting of various projects for her dubbing company Gaijin Productions, LLC.

==Career==
She can be heard in the commentary for the Region 1 &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; DVD along with fellow voice actors Taliesin Jaffe and husband/Gaijin co-owner Jaxon Lee.

Expanding on her anime work, Winn-Lee also provided the voice of Konoko, the protagonist of the Bungie video game Oni.

Winn-Lee served as ADR director, script writer and producer for the English versions of &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; and &quot;&quot;. She also directed and performed leading roles in the English versions of &quot;Dead Leaves&quot; and the &quot;Read or Die OVA&quot;.

She had been working with ADV Films for years before she moved out to create Gaijin Productions.

It was suggested by Spike Spencer (her friend as well as fellow voice actor) at Nan Desu Kan 2007 that she was interested in reprising her role(s) in the upcoming &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films. However, in May 2009, North American anime distributor Funimation announced that the role of Rei for the first film &quot;&quot; would be voiced by Brina Palencia, who is under contract to voice Rei Ayanami for the three remaining &quot;Evangelion&quot; &quot;Rebuild&quot; films. However, Winn-Lee returned to voice Rei for the 2021 Amazon release of the entire &quot;Rebuild&quot; series, including the new &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Amanda and Jason Lee&#x27;s son, Nicholas &quot;Noodle&quot; Lee, was born in November 2004. Her son was soon discovered to have infant leukemia, requiring extensive treatment before he was one year old. Amanda and Jason were not involved in any new projects for several years, because they were caring for their son. However, by November 2008, Nicholas had been cancer-free for three years, which is the benchmark for doctors that his odds of cancer recurrence are virtually non-existent. She wrote a book about these experiences in a memoir called &quot;The Noodle Chronicles: Everything I Know About Cheating Death I Learned from My Kid&quot;, which was released as an e-book.

<doc id="277137" wikidata="Q725157" url="?curid=277137" title="Tricky Sam Nanton">
<text>Joe &quot;Tricky Sam&quot; Nanton (February 1, 1904 – July 20, 1946) was an American trombonist with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. A pioneer of the plunger mute, Nanton is notable for his use of the distinctive wah-wah effect.

==Early life==
He was born Joseph Irish Nanton in New York City, United States. His parents were John Barzly Nanton and Emily Irish, both immigrants from the British West Indies.

Nanton began playing professionally in Washington, D.C., with bands led by Cliff Jackson and banjoist Elmer Snowden.

From 1923 to 1924, Nanton worked with Frazier&#x27;s Harmony Five. A year later, he performed with Snowden. At the age of 22, Nanton found his niche in Duke Ellington&#x27;s Orchestra, when he reluctantly took the place of his friend Charlie Irvis in 1926, and remained with Ellington until his early death in 1946. Nanton, along with Lawrence Brown, anchored the trombone section.

== The wah-wah sound ==
Nanton was one of the great pioneers of the plunger mute. In 1921, he heard Johnny Dunn playing the trumpet with a plunger, which Nanton realized could be used to similar effect on the trombone. Together with Ellington&#x27;s trumpeter Bubber Miley, Nanton is largely responsible for creating the characteristic wah-wah, or wa-wa, effect. Their highly expressive growl and plunger sounds were the main ingredient in the band&#x27;s early &quot;jungle&quot; sound, that evolved during the band&#x27;s late 1920s engagement at Harlem&#x27;s Cotton Club. According to Barney Bigard, Nanton &quot;grabbed his plunger. He could use that thing, too. It talked to you. I was sitting there, looking up at him, and every time he&#x27;d say &#x27;wa-wa,&#x27; I was saying &#x27;wa-wa&#x27; with my mouth, following him all the way through.&quot; Sensing Nanton&#x27;s impressive manual dexterity, the jovial alto saxophonist Otto Hardwick, ever inclined to tag friends with fitting nicknames, dubbed Nanton &quot;Tricky Sam&quot;: &quot;anything to save himself trouble—he was tricky that way.&quot;

From his early days with the Ellington band, Nanton was featured regularly. But he and Miley worked especially well in combination, often playing in harmony or &quot;playing off each other&quot; (embellishing and developing the musical theme of the preceding soloist into one&#x27;s own new musical idea). Nanton and Miley successfully incorporated plunger skills into their playing to evoke moods, people, or images.

The celebrated brass growl effect was vividly described by Duke Ellington&#x27;s son, Mercer Ellington: 
Nanton and Miley gave the Ellington Orchestra the reputation of being one of the &quot;dirtiest&quot; jazz groups. Many listeners were excited by the raunchy, earthy sounds of their growls and mutes. Among the best examples of their style are &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-oo&quot;, &quot;The Blues I Love to Sing&quot;, &quot;Black and Tan Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; to Town&quot;, and &quot;Doin&#x27; the Voom-Voom&quot;. After Miley&#x27;s premature departure in 1929, Nanton taught Cootie Williams, Miley&#x27;s successor, some of the growl and plunger techniques that Miley had used. Williams became a plunger virtuoso in his own right and helped the band retain its distinctive sound. The sounds they created were copied by many brass soloists in the swing era.

While other brass players became adept at growl and plunger techniques, Nanton&#x27;s sound was all his own. He developed, in addition to other tricks in his bag, a &quot;ya-ya&quot; effect with a plunger, in combination with a Magosy &amp; Buscher nonpareil trumpet straight mute. He kept the details of his technique a secret, even from his band mates, until his premature death.

Some ingredients in Nanton&#x27;s unique &quot;ya-ya&quot; sound, however, are known: inserting a trumpet straight mute into the bell, using a large plumber&#x27;s plunger outside the bell, and &quot;speaking&quot; into the instrument while playing. This sort of speaking involved changing the cavity of the mouth while silently reproducing different vowel sounds without actually vibrating the vocal cords. His palette of near-vocal sounds was radical for its time and helped produce the unique voicings in Ellington compositions, such as &quot;The Mooche&quot; &quot;Black and Tan Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;.

== Death ==
Nanton died from a stroke in San Francisco, California, on July 20, 1946, while on tour with the Ellington Orchestra. His death was an enormous loss for the Ellington Orchestra. While later trombonists, including Tyree Glenn and Quentin Jackson, tried to duplicate Tricky Sam&#x27;s plunger techniques, no one was able to completely replicate his sound. Nanton had a wide variety of expressions, and his intricate techniques were not well documented.

<text>Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter (May 6, 1937 – April 20, 2014) was an American-Canadian middleweight boxer who was wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for murder, until released following a petition of habeas corpus after almost 20 years in prison.

In 1966, Carter and his co-accused, John Artis, were arrested for a triple homicide which was committed at the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson, New Jersey, United States. Shortly after the killings at 2:30 am, a car, carrying Carter, Artis and a third man, was stopped by police outside the bar while its occupants were on their way home from a nearby nightclub. They were allowed to go on their way but, after dropping off the third man, Carter and Artis were stopped and arrested while they were passing the bar a second time, 45 minutes later. In 1967, they were convicted of all three murders and given life sentences. Their sentences were overturned in 1985. Prosecutors appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but declined to retry the case after the appeal failed.

Carter&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;The Sixteenth Round&quot;, written while he was in prison, was published in 1974 by Viking Press. The story inspired the 1975 Bob Dylan song &quot;Hurricane&quot; and the 1999 film &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, starring Denzel Washington as Carter. From 1993 to 2005, Carter served as executive director of the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted, later renamed Innocence Canada.

In 2019, the case was the focus of a 13-part BBC podcast series, &quot;The Hurricane Tapes&quot;. The series was based on interviews which were conducted with survivors, case notes which were taken during the original investigations and 40 hours of recorded interviews of Carter by the author Ken Klonsky, who cited them in his 2011 book &quot;The Eye of the Hurricane&quot;.

== Early life ==
Carter was born in Clifton, New Jersey in 1937, the fourth of seven children. He later admitted to a troubled relationship with his father, a strict disciplinarian. At the age of eleven, he was sentenced to a juvenile reformatory for assault, having stabbed a man who he alleged had tried to sexually assault him. Carter escaped from the reformatory in 1954 and joined the United States Army. A few months after completing basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he was sent to West Germany. While in West Germany, Carter began to box for the Army. He was discharged in 1956 as unfit for service, after four courts-martial. Shortly after his discharge, he returned home to New Jersey, was convicted of two muggings and sent to prison.

==Boxing career==

After his release from prison in September 1961, Carter became a professional boxer. At , Carter was shorter than the average middleweight, but he fought all of his professional career at 155–160 lb (70–72.6 kg). His aggressive style and punching power (resulting in many early-round knockouts) drew attention, establishing him as a crowd favorite and earning him the nickname &quot;Hurricane&quot;. After he defeated a number of middleweight contenders—such as Florentino Fernandez, Holley Mims, Gomeo Brennan and George Benton—the boxing world took notice. &quot;The Ring&quot; first listed him as one of its Top 10 middleweight contenders in July 1963. At the end of 1965, they ranked him as the number five middleweight.

He fought six times in 1963, winning four bouts and losing two. He remained ranked in the lower part of the top 10 until December 20, when he surprised the boxing world by flooring past and future world champion Emile Griffith twice in the first round and scoring a technical knockout. That win resulted in &quot;The Ring&quot;″s ranking of Carter as the number three contender for Joey Giardello&#x27;s world middleweight title. Carter won two more fights (one a decision over future heavyweight champion Jimmy Ellis) in 1964, before meeting Giardello in Philadelphia for a 15-round championship match on December 14. Carter landed a few solid rights to the head in the fourth round that left Giardello staggering, but was unable to follow them up and Giardello took control of the fight in the fifth round. The judges decided unanimously in favor of Giardello.

After that fight, Carter&#x27;s ranking in &quot;The Ring&quot; began to decline. He fought nine times in 1965, winning five but losing three of four against contenders Luis Manuel Rodríguez, Dick Tiger and Harry Scott. Tiger, in particular, floored Carter three times in their match. &quot;It was&quot;, Carter said, &quot;the worst beating that I took in my life—inside or outside the ring&quot;. During his visit to London to fight Scott, Carter was involved in an incident in which a shot was fired in his hotel room.

Carter&#x27;s last fight was on August 5, 1966, against Juan Carlos Rivero. He lost the fight via points decision. Carter&#x27;s career ended short with a record of 27 wins with 19 total knockouts (8 KOs and 11 TKOs), 12 losses and one draw in 40 fights. He received an honorary championship title belt from the World Boxing Council in 1993 (as did Joey Giardello at the same banquet) and was later inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Arrest and conviction==

At approximately 2:30 a.m. on June 17, 1966, two men entered the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson, New Jersey and began shooting. The bartender, James Oliver and a customer, Fred Nauyoks, were killed immediately. Hazel Tanis died in a hospital a month later, having suffered multiple wounds from shotgun pellets; a third customer, Willie Marins, survived the attack, despite a head wound that blinded him in one eye. When questioned, both told police the shooters had been black males, but neither identified Carter or John Artis.

Ten minutes after the murders, around 2:40 AM, a police cruiser stopped Carter and Artis in a rental car, returning from a night out at the Nite Spot, a nearby bar. Carter was in the back, with Artis driving and a third man, John Royster, in the passenger seat. The police recognised Carter, a well-known and controversial local figure, but let him go. Minutes later, the same officers solicited a description of the getaway car from two eyewitnesses outside the bar, Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Valentine and Alfred Bello.

Bello later admitted he was in the area acting as a lookout while an accomplice, Arthur Bradley, broke into a nearby warehouse. At the time, he claimed to have discovered the bodies when he entered the bar to buy cigarettes; it also transpired that he took the opportunity to empty the cash register and encountered the police as he exited. At the trial, he testified he was approaching the Lafayette when two black males, one with a shotgun, the other a pistol, came around the corner. He ran from them and they got into a white car that was double-parked near the Lafayette.

Valentine lived above the bar and heard the shots. Like Bello, she reported seeing two black men leave the bar, then get into a white car. They reportedly described it as white, with &quot;a geometric design, sort of a butterfly type design in the back of the car&quot; and New York state license plates, with blue background and orange lettering. Another neighbor, Ronald Ruggiero, also heard the shots and said that, from his window, he saw Alfred Bello running west on Lafayette Street toward 16th Street. He then heard the screech of tires and saw a white car shoot past, heading west, with two black males in the front seat.

Valentine initially stated the car had rear lights which lit up completely like butterflies. At the retrial in 1976, she changed this to an accurate description of Carter&#x27;s car, which had conventional tail-lights with aluminum decoration in a butterfly shape. This aligned with that provided by Bello; the prosecution later suggested the confusion was the result of a misreading of a court transcript by the defense.

Having dropped off Royster, Carter was now being driven home by Artis; they were stopped again at 3:00 AM and ordered to follow the police to the station, where they were arrested. However, variances in descriptions given by Valentine and Bello, the physical characteristics of the attackers provided by the two survivors, lack of forensic evidence and the timeline provided by the police were key factors in the conviction being overturned in 1985.

Forensics later established the victims were shot by a .32-caliber pistol and a 12-gauge shotgun, although the weapons were never found. There was no forensic evidence linking Carter or Artis to the murders. While gun residue tests were commonly used, DeSimone, the lead detective, later claimed he had insufficient time to bring in an expert to administer the tests. He did arrange for an expert to conduct lie detector tests, which they passed. In 1976, a second report was discovered, claiming they failed. After 17 hours of interrogation, they were released. Carter and Artis voluntarily appeared before a grand jury, which found there was no case to answer. 

Several months later, Bello changed his story, after the police discovered why he was in the area and his theft from the cash register. He positively identified Artis as one of the attackers, while Bradley now came forward to claim Carter was the other; based on this, the two were arrested and indicted. Bello later claimed that in return he was promised the US$10,500 reward offered for catching the killers, though it was never paid.

The rental car had been impounded when Carter and Artis were arrested and retained by police. Five days after their release a detective reported that on searching it again he discovered two unfired rounds, one .32 caliber, the other 12-gauge. Neither matched those retrieved from the victims; the .32 round was brass, rather than copper, while the shotgun shell was an older model, with a different wad and color.

Asked to account for these differences at the trial, the prosecution produced a second report, allegedly lodged 75 minutes after the murders which recorded the two rounds. They were unable to explain why, having that evidence, the police released the men, or why the standard &#x27;bag and tag&#x27; procedure was not followed. They also argued that, since the expended rounds retrieved at the scene were also a mixture, the fact that the two rounds did not match was meaningless; what did matter was they were the same caliber as those used in the shootings.

The defense, led by Raymond A. Brown, focused on inconsistencies in the evidence given by eyewitnesses Marins and Bello. He also produced witnesses who confirmed Carter and Artis were still in the Nite Spot at the time of the shootings. The all-white jury convicted both men of first-degree murder, with a recommendation of mercy, so that they were not sentenced to death. Judge Samuel Larner imposed one concurrent and two consecutive life sentences on Carter, and three concurrent life sentences on Artis.

===Retrial and release===
In 1974, Bello and Bradley withdrew their identifications of Carter and Artis, and these recantations were used as the basis for a motion for a new trial. Judge Samuel Larner denied the motion on December 11, saying they &quot;lacked the ring of truth&quot;.

Despite Larner&#x27;s ruling, Madison Avenue advertising executive George Lois organized a campaign on Carter&#x27;s behalf, which led to increasing public support for a retrial or pardon. Boxer Muhammad Ali lent his support to the campaign (including publicly wishing Carter good luck on his appeal during his appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in September 1973). Bob Dylan co-wrote (with Jacques Levy) and performed a song called &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1975), which declared that Carter was innocent. On December 7, 1975, Dylan performed the song at a concert at Trenton State Prison, where Carter was temporarily an inmate.

During the hearing on the recantations, defense attorneys also argued that Bello and Bradley had lied during the 1967 trial, telling the jurors that they had made only certain narrow, limited deals with prosecutors in exchange for their trial testimony. A detective taped one interrogation of Bello in 1966, and when it was played during the recantation hearing, defense attorneys argued that the tape revealed promises beyond that to which Bello had testified. If so, prosecutors had either had a Brady obligation to disclose this additional exculpatory evidence, or a duty to disclose that their witnesses had lied on the stand.

Larner denied this second argument as well, but the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously held that the evidence of various deals made between the prosecution and witnesses Bello and Bradley should have been disclosed to the defense before or during the 1967 trial as this could have &quot;affected the jury&#x27;s evaluation of the credibility&quot; of the eyewitnesses. &quot;The defendants&#x27; right to a fair trial was substantially prejudiced&quot;, said Justice Mark Sullivan. The court set aside the original convictions and granted Carter and Artis a new trial.

Despite the difficulties of prosecuting a ten-year-old case, Prosecutor Burrell Ives Humphreys decided to try Carter and Artis again. To ensure, as best he could, that he did not use perjured testimony to obtain a conviction, Humphreys had Bello polygraphed—once by Leonard H. Harrelson and a second time by Richard Arther, both well-known and respected experts in the field. Both men concluded that Bello was telling the truth when he said that he had seen Carter outside the Lafayette immediately after the murders.

However, Harrelson also reported orally that Bello had been inside the bar shortly before and at the time of the shooting, a conclusion that contradicted Bello&#x27;s 1967 trial testimony wherein he had said that he had been on the street at the time of the shooting. Despite this oral report, Harrelson&#x27;s subsequent written report stated that Bello&#x27;s 1967 testimony had been truthful.

===Second conviction and appeal===
During the new trial in 1976, Alfred Bello repeated his 1967 testimony, identifying Carter and Artis as the two armed men he had seen outside the Lafayette Grill. Bradley refused to cooperate with prosecutors, and neither prosecution nor defense called him as a witness.

The defense responded with testimony from multiple witnesses who identified Carter at the locations he claimed to be when the murders took place. Investigator Fred Hogan, whose efforts had led to the recantations of Bello and Bradley, appeared as a defense witness. Hogan was asked on cross examination whether any bribes or inducements were offered to Bello to secure his recantation, which Hogan denied. His original handwritten notes on his conversations with Bello were entered into evidence. The defense also pointed out the inconsistencies in the testimony of Patricia Valentine, and read the 1967 testimony of William Marins, who had died in 1973, noting that his descriptions of the shooters were drastically different from Artis&#x27;s and Carter&#x27;s actual appearances.

The court also heard testimony from a Carter associate that Passaic County prosecutors had tried to pressure her into testifying against Carter. Prosecutors denied the charge. After deliberating for almost nine hours, the jury again found Carter and Artis guilty of the murders. Judge Leopizzi re-imposed the same sentences on both men: a double life sentence for Carter, a single life sentence for Artis.

Artis was released on parole in 1981. Carter&#x27;s attorneys continued to appeal. In 1982, the Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed his convictions (4–3). Although the justices felt that the prosecutors should have disclosed Harrelson&#x27;s oral opinion (about Bello&#x27;s location at the time of the murders) to the defense, only a minority thought this was material. The majority thus concluded that the prosecution had not withheld information the Brady disclosure law required them to provide to the defense.

According to bail bondswoman Carolyn Kelley, in 1975–1976 she helped raise funds to win a second trial for Carter, which resulted in his release on bail in March 1976. On a fund-raising trip the following month, Kelley said the boxer beat her (Kelley weighed 112 pounds at the time of the alleged beating) severely over a disputed hotel bill. The &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; reported the alleged beating in a front-page story several weeks later, and celebrity support for Carter quickly eroded, though Carter denied the accusation. Kelley declined to pursue charges, stating that she felt Carter needed help, and saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want to press charges because jail is not the place for Rubin. He needs treatment. I don&#x27;t want to do anything to hurt him&quot;. Passaic County Judge William Marchese held hearings on the incident in July 1976 and changed the terms of Carter&#x27;s bail after determining that the assault had occurred. Mae Thelma Basket, whom Carter had married in 1963, divorced him after their second child was born, because she found out that he had been unfaithful to her.

===Federal court action===
In 1985, Carter&#x27;s attorneys filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. Later that year, Judge H. Lee Sarokin of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted the writ, noting that the prosecution had been &quot;predicated upon an appeal to racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure&quot;, and set aside the convictions. Carter, 48 years old, was freed without bail in November 1985.

Prosecutors appealed Sarokin&#x27;s ruling to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and filed a motion with the court to return Carter to prison pending the outcome of the appeal. The court denied this motion and eventually upheld Sarokin&#x27;s opinion, affirming his Brady analysis without commenting on his other rationale.

The prosecutors appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case.

Prosecutors therefore could have tried Carter (and Artis) a third time, but decided not to, and filed a motion to dismiss the original indictments in 1988. &quot;It is just not legally feasible to sustain a prosecution, and not practical after almost 22 years to be trying anyone&quot;, said New Jersey Attorney General W. Cary Edwards. Acting Passaic County Prosecutor John P. Goceljak said several factors made a retrial impossible, including Bello&#x27;s &quot;current unreliability&quot; as a witness and the unavailability of other witnesses. Goceljak also doubted whether the prosecution could reintroduce the racially motivated crime theory due to the federal court rulings. A judge granted the motion to dismiss, bringing an end to the legal proceedings.

==Post-emancipation==
Carter lived in Toronto, Ontario, where he became a Canadian citizen, and was executive director of the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted (AIDWYC) from 1993 until 2005. Carter resigned when the AIDWYC declined to support Carter&#x27;s protest of the appointment to a judgeship of Susan MacLean, who was the prosecutor of Canadian Guy Paul Morin, who served over eighteen months in prison for rape and murder until exonerated by DNA evidence.

Carter&#x27;s second marriage was to Lisa Peters. The couple separated later.

In 1996, Carter, then 59, was arrested when Toronto police mistakenly identified him as a suspect in his thirties believed to have sold drugs to an undercover officer. He was released after the police realized their error.

Carter often served as a motivational speaker. On October 14, 2005, he received two honorary Doctorates of Law, one from York University (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and one from Griffith University (Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), in recognition of his work with AIDWYC and the Innocence Project. Carter received the Abolition Award from Death Penalty Focus in 1996.

==Prostate cancer and death==
In March 2012, while attending the International Justice Conference in Burswood, Western Australia, Carter revealed that he had terminal prostate cancer. At the time, doctors gave him between three and six months to live. Beginning shortly after that time, John Artis lived with and cared for Carter, and on April 20, 2014, he confirmed that Carter, at the age of 76, had succumbed to his illness. He was afterwards cremated and his ashes were scattered in part over Cape Cod and in part at a horse farm in Kentucky.

In the months leading up to his death, Carter had worked for the exoneration of David McCallum, a Brooklyn man who had been incarcerated since 1985 on charges of murder. Two months before his death, Carter published &quot;Hurricane Carter&#x27;s Dying Wish&quot;, an opinion piece in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, in which he asked for an independent review of McCallum&#x27;s conviction. &quot;I request only that McCallum be granted a full hearing by the Brooklyn conviction integrity unit, now under the auspices of the new district attorney, Ken Thompson. Knowing what I do, I am certain that when the facts are brought to light, Thompson will recommend his immediate release ... Just as my own verdict &#x27;was predicated on racism rather than reason and on concealment rather than disclosure&#x27;, as Sarokin wrote, so too was McCallum&#x27;s&quot;, Carter wrote. On October 15, 2014, McCallum was exonerated.
John Artis died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm on November 7, 2021, at the age of 75.

==In popular culture==
Carter&#x27;s story inspired:
* The 1975 Bob Dylan song &quot;Hurricane&quot;, which proclaimed that Carter was innocent. Carter appeared as himself in Dylan&#x27;s 1978 movie &quot;Renaldo and Clara.&quot; In the 2019 film &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese&quot;, Dylan talked about his involvement with the Carter case and Carter was also interviewed in the film, describing his relationship with Dylan.
* Norman Jewison&#x27;s 1999 feature film &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, starring Denzel Washington in the lead role as Carter. The film is about Rubin Carter&#x27;s accusation, trials, and time spent in prison. Carter later discussed at a lecture how he fell in love with Washington&#x27;s portrayal of him during auditions for &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, noting that boxer Marvelous Marvin Hagler and actors Wesley Snipes and Samuel L. Jackson all vied for the role. For his performance as Carter, Washington won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama at the 57th Golden Globe Awards. Washington was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Carter at the 72nd Academy Awards.

<text>My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding is a 1997 American romantic comedy film directed by P.J. Hogan from a screenplay by Ronald Bass who also produced. The film stars Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, and Rupert Everett.

The soundtrack song &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; was covered by singer Diana King and featured heavily in the film, making it a U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit. The soundtrack featured a number of Burt Bacharach/Hal David songs.

&quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score (James Newton Howard), in addition to 3 Golden Globe Award nominations – Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Musical or Comedy (Roberts) and Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture (Everett). Post-release, it has often been cited as one of the best romantic comedy films of the 1990s and of all time.

==Plot==

Three weeks before her 28th birthday, New York City food critic Julianne &quot;Jules&quot; Potter receives a call from her lifelong friend Michael O&#x27;Neal, a Chicago sportswriter. Years earlier, the two agreed that if they were both unmarried by age 28, they would marry each other. Michael tells her that in four days, he will marry the beautiful Kimmy Wallace, a college student eight years his junior whose father owns the Chicago White Sox. Realizing she is in love with him, Jules resolves to sabotage his wedding. Arriving in Chicago, she reunites with Michael and meets Kimmy, who asks her to be the maid of honor. Jules schemes to break up the couple, but her attempt to humiliate Kimmy at a karaoke bar backfires. She manipulates Kimmy into asking her father to offer Michael a job, which Jules knows will anger Michael, but this fails as well.

Frustrated, Jules begs her friend George Downes for help, and he flies to Chicago. On George&#x27;s advice, Jules prepares to tell Michael how much she loves him but instead tells him that she is engaged to George, hoping to make Michael jealous. George, who is gay, plays along but embarrasses Jules at lunch with the wedding party, singing &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; as the whole restaurant joins in. George flies home, and Jules tells Michael that her &quot;relationship&quot; with George is over. Michael admits to feeling jealous and gives her the chance to confess her feelings, but she lets the moment pass. They share a dance as Michael sings their song, &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;.

The day before the wedding, at Kimmy&#x27;s father&#x27;s office, Jules uses his email account to forge a message from him to Michael&#x27;s boss, asking that Michael be fired to allow Kimmy&#x27;s father to hire him at Kimmy&#x27;s insistence. She saves the message rather than send it, but later realizes that Kimmy&#x27;s father has unknowingly sent the email. Jules lies to enlist Michael&#x27;s help, but they find the office locked. Returning to Jules&#x27; hotel, Michael receives a message from his boss notifying him of the email. Furious, he calls Kimmy, calling off the wedding.

The next morning, Jules discovers that neither Michael nor Kimmy have told anyone else that the wedding is off. She tries to manipulate the couple into breaking up for good, but Michael and Kimmy decide to get married after all. Jules finally confesses her love to Michael and passionately kisses him. Kimmy witnesses this and drives away distraught, pursued by Michael, who in turn is pursued by Jules in a caterer&#x27;s truck. Jules calls George while driving and explains the situation, who assures her that Michael loves Kimmy and Jules has now a brief opportunity to ensure the couple are reconciled before the scheduled time of the wedding. Finding Michael at Chicago Union Station, Jules confesses to everything. He forgives her and tells her that here at the station is where he proposed to Kimmy and she accepted, and they split up to look for Kimmy.

Jules finds Kimmy in the bathroom of Comiskey Park. Amid a crowd of onlookers, Kimmy confronts Jules for interfering with Michael. Jules apologizes, assuring Kimmy that Michael truly loves her, and they reconcile. The wedding proceeds, and at the reception, Jules gives a heartfelt speech as Kimmy&#x27;s maid of honor. Jules allows the newlyweds to temporarily have &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; as their song until they find their own song. Jules and Michael share their goodbyes, both finally moving on. On the phone with George, Jules is surprised to see him at the reception, and they dance together.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; opened at No. 2 at the North American box office, making $21,678,377 USD in its opening weekend, behind &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. It stayed in the top 10 weekly U.S. box-office for six consecutive weeks, and eventually earned $127,120,029. The worldwide gross total stands at $299,288,605 (listed as one of the 10 biggest films of 1997 both domestically and worldwide).

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; holds an approval rating of 74% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Thanks to a charming performance from Julia Roberts and a subversive spin on the genre, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; is a refreshingly entertaining romantic comedy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Total Film&quot; praised the film, giving it four stars out of five and stating &quot;[h]ere [Roberts] banishes all memories of &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; (1996) and &quot;I Love Trouble&quot; (1994) with a lively, nay sparkling, performance. Smiling that killer smile, shedding those winning tears, delivering great lines with effortless charm, Roberts is back where she rightly belongs - not in grey period costume, but as the sexy queen of laughs.&quot; The review also called the film &quot;a perfect date movie&quot; that &quot;proves Roberts isn&#x27;t as crap as we all thought she was.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praises Roberts as &quot;riper, more dexterous with a comic line, slyer with modulation,&quot; concluding that &quot;Roberts puts her heart into this one.&quot; Joanna Berry of &quot;Radio Times&quot; gave it four stars out of five, observing that this &quot;sparkling comedy&quot; proved to be a career-resurrecting film for Julia Roberts.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and said, &quot;One of the pleasures of Ronald Bass&#x27; screenplay is the way it subverts the usual comic formulas that would fuel a plot like this.&quot; CNN movie reviewer Carol Buckland said Roberts &quot;lights up the screen&quot;, calling the film &quot;fluffy fun&quot;.

Andrew Johnston, writing in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, observed, &quot;The best scene occurs when Julianne&#x27;s gay editor and confidant George (Everett) turns up in Chicago and poses as her fiancé, seizing control of the film for five delicious minutes. His devilish impersonation of a straight guy is priceless, and things only get better when he leads a sing-along at the rehearsal dinner. At times like this, when the film spins into pop culture overdrive it stops being a star vehicle and flirts with genuine comic brilliance.&quot; Michelle Regna of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot;, in 2015, claimed it is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time.

=== Awards and recognition ===

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was released on June 17, 1997, and contains covers of familiar songs. It was praised by AllMusic for working &quot;better than it should, since most of the vocalists... concentrate on the songs&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1985, Providence, Rhode Island, 16-year-old high school student Ted Stroehmann is about to go on a prom date with his dream girl, Mary Jensen, when he gets his scrotum stuck in his zipper. He is hospitalized after managing to painfully unzip it, which causes him to miss their date. Ted subsequently loses contact with her.

Thirteen years later, in 1998, Ted is a magazine writer and still in love with Mary. On the advice of his best friend, Dom Woganowski, Ted hires private investigator Pat Healy to track her down. Healy discovers that she is an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami with her intellectually disabled brother Warren. After observing her for a few days, Healy also becomes fixated on her. He returns to Providence and lies to Ted about Mary, telling him she is overweight and has four kids by three different men. Healy quits his job and returns to Miami to pursue her. He resorts to lying and stalking to win Mary over.

Meanwhile, Ted finds out that Healy was lying about Mary and drives to Florida to see her. During the drive, he picks up a hitchhiker who leaves a dead body in his car. Ted is mistakenly arrested for the murder and bailed out by Dom after the hitchhiker confesses to being the killer. Healy and Mary spend several weeks dating before her British architect friend Tucker exposes his lies. She ends their relationship after Tucker slanders Healy with false stories of being a suspected serial killer. Angered over this, Healy confronts him and discovers Tucker actually is an American pizza delivery boy named Norm Phipps who also is infatuated with Mary. Years earlier, Norm deliberately injured himself in order to become her patient and get close to her. He pretends to still be disabled to stay close and drive away other possible love interests. When Ted and Mary begin dating again, Healy and Norm team up to drive Ted away.

When Mary reads an anonymous letter revealing that Ted hired Healy to find her, she becomes upset and dumps him. Ted then angrily confronts Healy and Norm, who deny sending the letter, and Ted leaves in frustration. Dom, who is revealed to be Mary&#x27;s ex-boyfriend &quot;Woogie&quot;, later shows up in her apartment and admits to writing the letter. She previously had a restraining order against Dom after he became obsessed with her, which started again when Ted found her despite being married with kids.

Norm and Healy, listening outside, intervene and save Mary from Dom. Ted then arrives along with Brett Favre, an ex-boyfriend Mary dumped after Norm lied about him insulting Warren. Ted declares Favre should be with her since he is the only one not to use deception to win her over. After reuniting Favre with her and leaving the other men defeated, Ted leaves in tears, but she chases him down outside and says &quot;I&#x27;d be happiest with you&quot; before they kiss. Magda’s boyfriend uses a sniper rifle to attempt to shoot Ted for kissing Mary (as he is also infatuated with her), but hits one of the band members instead.

==Production==
&quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; was directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, who had previously made &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Kingpin&quot; in 1996. According to Bobby, the scene where Ted accidentally gets his scrotum stuck in his pants fly was inspired by a real incident, when their sister was listening to some records with some eighth grade students in the basement of their house: &quot;One of the kids went up [to the bathroom] and he zipped himself up. He was in there for a long time. My dad, who was a doctor, actually had to go in and say, &#x27;Hey, kid. You alright?&#x27;&quot; Most of the film was shot in Miami, Florida. The Big Pink Restaurant is where Healy meets with Sully, and the Miami-Dade Cultural Center is the location for the architecture exhibit Mary and Healy attend together. The hair gel scene was filmed at the Cardozo Hotel, while Churchill&#x27;s Pub was used as a strip club for a scene with Healy. The makeup effects were the handiwork of makeup effects designer Tony Gardner.

Besides Ben Stiller, actors Owen Wilson and Jon Stewart were considered potential candidates for the role of Ted Stroehmann. Bill Murray was considered for the role of Pat Healy, but the Farrelly brothers thought he was too old for it. Vince Vaughn and Cuba Gooding Jr. were also considered for the role of Pat Healy. Because the Farrelly brothers were fans of the New England Patriots, they originally wanted to cast quarterback Drew Bledsoe as Mary&#x27;s football-playing boyfriend, but he could not do it due to a mosh incident he had in a club. The Farrelly brothers later offered the role to Steve Young, but he turned it down due to the film&#x27;s coarse nature. Ultimately, the role was given to Brett Favre. Chris Farley was considered for the role of Mary&#x27;s brother Warren, however, his health was in a rapid decline due to his drug addictions and he was forced to turn down the role. He died in December 1997 in the middle of the film&#x27;s production.

==Release==
&quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on August 3, 1999. Four years later, a new two-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD release premiered on July 1, 2003. On May 5, 2009, the film was officially released on Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Upon its release, &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; ranked in fourth place behind &quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; and &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;, collecting $13.7 million during its opening weekend, combined with $17.8 million from its first five days. During Labor Day weekend, the film reached the number one spot, making $10.9 million and beating &quot;Blade&quot;. &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; was 1998&#x27;s third-highest-grossing film in North America as well as the fourth highest-grossing film of the year globally. The film made $369million worldwide on a budget of $23million, with $176million coming from the U.S. and Canada. It was released in the United Kingdom on September 25, 1998, and topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next two weekends.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of 88 critics reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; proves that unrelentingly, unabashedly puerile humor doesn&#x27;t necessarily come at the expense of a film&#x27;s heart.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars, stating, &quot;What a blessed relief is laughter. It flies in the face of manners, values, political correctness, and decorum. It exposes us for what we are, the only animal with a sense of humor.&quot; Gene Siskel ranked the film number 9 on his 10 Best films of 1998 (the final &quot;best of&quot; list before his death).

<text>James Hammond Trumbull (December 20, 1821 – August 5, 1897) was an American historian, philologist, bibliographer, and politician. A scholar of American Indian languages, he served as the first Connecticut State Librarian in 1854 and as Secretary of State from 1861 to 1866.

== Early life and education ==
Trumbull was born in Stonington, Connecticut, to parents Gurdon and Sarah Ann (Swan) Trumbull. His mother was descended from Stonington&#x27;s first colonists; his father was a wealthy merchant and state legislator, distantly related to Governor Jonathan Trumbull. James Trumbull&#x27;s siblings included clergyman and author Henry Clay Trumbull and entomologist and author Annie Trumbull Slosson. Trumbull studied at Tracy&#x27;s Academy in Norwich and enrolled at Yale University in 1838. He never received his degree, withdrawing before the end of his junior year because of ill health.

Trumbull received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale in 1850 and an honorary LLD in 1871. He subsequently received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard University and an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Columbia University, both in 1887.

== Career ==
While at Yale, Trumbull developed a keen interest in natural history, particularly conchology. Joining the Yale Natural History Society, he collaborated with James Harvey Linsley to write and publish a three-volume catalog of Connecticut&#x27;s fish, reptiles, and shellfish in 1844 and 1845.

In 1847, Trumbull moved to Hartford and became assistant secretary of state of Connecticut from 1847 to 1852. Becoming interested in local history, in 1852 he edited and published, at his own expense, the first volume of the &quot;Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut (1636-1689)&quot;, followed two years later by a second volume and in 1859 by a third volume. Charles J. Hoadly subsequently edited the remaining twelve volumes in the series.

Trumbull was appointed as the first Connecticut State Librarian in 1854. Although he served for only one year before Hoadly assumed the office, he did much to organize the library and advocate for better funding. He served as assistant secretary of state again from 1858 to 1861 before winning consecutive annual elections to serve as Secretary of the State of Connecticut from 1861 to 1866. He was a member of the Republican Party.

Trumbull was a life member of the Connecticut Historical Society, having been elected to membership in 1847. He served as secretary from 1848 to 1863, president from 1863 to 1889, and librarian for its David Watkinson Library from 1863 to 1891 before becoming librarian emeritus until 1897. He was a founding member of the American Philological Association, of which he was elected treasurer in 1869, vice president in 1873, and president in 1874. He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the historical societies of Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, New York, and Wisconsin. He was elected to the American Antiquarian Society in 1855 and the National Academy of Sciences in 1872.

== Writings ==
Trumbull was a prolific historian and bibliographer. He wrote extensively on the history of Connecticut, such as &quot;Historical Notes on some Provisions of the Connecticut Statutes&quot; (1860–1861), &quot;The True Blue Laws of Connecticut&quot; (1876), and &quot;The Memorial History of Hartford County&quot; (1886). He published numerous scholarly editions of writings by Roger Williams, Thomas Lechford, Abraham Pierson, John Eliot, and other historical figures. Between 1878 and 1893, he prepared a massive five-volume catalog for the auction of George Brinley&#x27;s private book collection of 9500 titles.

Trumbull&#x27;s contemporaries considered his knowledge of Native American philology second only to Daniel Garrison Brinton. His study of Algonquian languages led him to publish &quot;The Composition of Indian Geographical Names&quot; (1870), &quot;The Best Methods of Studying the Indian Languages&quot; (1871), &quot;Indian Names of Places in Connecticut&quot; (1881), and other works. Yale University appointed Trumbull a lecturer in Native American languages during the 1870s and 1880s, though the appointment came with no responsibilities and was largely honorary.

Trumbull&#x27;s correspondence, manuscripts, notebooks, and other papers are held at the Connecticut History Society and at Yale University.

== Personal life ==
In April 1855, Trumbull married Sarah A. Robinson of Hartford. The couple traveled to Europe and Egypt for their honeymoon. Trumbull died of influenza (grippe) following a brief illness at his home in Hartford on August 5, 1897. He was 75 years old. He was survived by his wife and their only child, Annie Eliot Trumbull.

<text>Lynn Joseph Frazier (December 21, 1874January 11, 1947) was an American educator and politician who served as the 12th governor of North Dakota from 1917 until being recalled in 1921 and later served as a U.S. Senator from North Dakota from 1923 to 1941. He was the first American governor ever successfully recalled from office. The only other American governor to ever be recalled is Gray Davis, who was recalled in 2003.

== Early life ==
Frazier was born in Medford, Minnesota. His family moved to North Dakota when he was six years old. He graduated from Grafton High School in 1892, and Mayville Normal School in 1895. He completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of North Dakota and graduated with honors. Prior to his career in state and national politics, Frazier was a farmer and school teacher.

Frazier intended to become a doctor, but the unexpected deaths of his father and brother forced him to take over the family farm.

==Career==
After winning the Republican primary as the Nonpartisan League candidate, Frazier was elected Governor in 1916 with 79% of the vote.

Frazier was extremely popular and implemented several reforms such as the establishment of the Bank of North Dakota and the North Dakota Mill and Elevator, which have been a lasting legacy of the Nonpartisan League election success until today.

During the 1919 national coal strike, Governor Frazier took a unique approach to the strike. He declared martial law, took over the mines with United Mine Workers of America contracts and ran them in cooperation with the union.

He was re-elected twice, in 1918 and 1920, but an economic depression hit the agricultural sector during his third term and resulted in a successful private-business-led grassroots movement to press for his recall. In 1921, Frazier was the first governor to be successfully removed from office. Independent Voters Association member Ragnvald Nestos was elected to his place.

After the recall, Frazier was elected in 1922 to the U.S. Senate, again as the NPL candidate on the Republican ticket. He served until losing a bid for re-election in 1940, when he was unseated in the Republican primary by William Langer.

==Personal life==
Frazier was twice married, to Lottie J. Stafford, with whom he had five children, from November 26, 1903, until her death on January 14, 1935, and to Catherine Paulson, whom he married in 1937.

==Death and legacy==
Frazier died in Riverdale, Maryland, on January 11, 1947, at the age of 72. He is buried in Hoople Cemetery, Hoople, North Dakota.

Governor Frazier is portrayed in the 1984 Nebraska Public TV documentary &quot;Plowing up a Storm&quot;.

<text>America&#x27;s Sweethearts is a 2001 American romantic comedy film directed by Joe Roth and written by Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan. It stars Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, with Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci, Seth Green, Alan Arkin, and Christopher Walken in supporting roles.

==Plot==

Veteran publicist Lee Phillips is fired from his position at a major film studio. Studio head Dave Kingman later invites him back for a private screening of &quot;Time Over Time&quot;, a new time travel thriller starring Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas. Eddie and Gwen were a beloved husband-and-wife team dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot; whose marriage fell apart when Gwen had an affair with her co-star Hector, causing Eddie to suffer a mental breakdown and check into a remote New Age wellness retreat.

When Lee arrives, Kingman reveals he has nothing to screen: the movie&#x27;s director, Hal Weidmann, is refusing to release the completed film, insisting on premiering it at the upcoming press junket. Kingman is desperate to get hold of it, as the studio has recently suffered a string of flops and &quot;Time Over Time&quot; is likely the couple&#x27;s last film together. Unsure when, or even if, the film will arrive, Kingman begs Lee to promote it at the junket by convincing the press that Eddie and Gwen are back together, promising to restore Lee&#x27;s job if he succeeds. Lee recruits rookie publicist Danny to assist him.

Lee visits Gwen, who now resides with Hector, to persuade her to attend the junket. Kiki, Gwen&#x27;s sister and personal assistant, convinces her that a junket appearance will help her floundering career and public image. At the wellness retreat, Lee bribes its spiritual guru with a luxury car to convince a reluctant Eddie to face Gwen.

At the junket, Gwen cozies up to Eddie for the press, while behind the scenes their interactions remain tense. Eddie pines for her initially but soon tires of her duplicitous nature. Gwen uses Kiki as her go-between with Eddie, unaware she has feelings for him. To distract the press until the film arrives, Lee and Danny plant clues that Eddie and Gwen have reconciled. After Lee leaks a misleading photo of them to the media, Hector shows up and confronts Eddie, leading to a fistfight that ends when Hector knocks him out with a serving tray. Kingman is thrilled with the publicity, but a guilt-ridden Lee starts to question his tactics.

Kiki helps Eddie to his room, where they give into their growing attraction and have sex. However, at Gwen&#x27;s cottage the next morning, Eddie tells Gwen he is &quot;not technically&quot; seeing anyone, causing Kiki to storm off in disgust. Eddie goes after Kiki, who lambastes him for his inability to move on from Gwen. Kiki later laments to Lee about a lifetime of coming second to Gwen, while Eddie has an epiphany and realizes Kiki is who he truly wants. Lee, deducing that Eddie and Kiki are in love, encourages him not to give up, but just then, Weidmann arrives in a helicopter to deliver the film.

At the screening, Weidmann shocks everyone by revealing that he abandoned the original script and used hidden camera footage, without the actors&#x27; knowledge, to create a &quot;reality movie&quot; instead. The new film follows Gwen&#x27;s affair with Hector and Eddie&#x27;s resulting mental decline; highlights include Gwen&#x27;s demanding behavior on set, Kingman being insulted by his assistant, and Gwen mocking Hector&#x27;s penis size. Gwen and Kingman confront Weidmann, who defends his artistic vision, while Hector assures the crowd that he is well-endowed (which Weidmann&#x27;s daughter is happy to confirm). Desperate, Gwen announces that she and Eddie are getting back together, but he rebuffs her and publicly declares his love for Kiki. Kiki decides to stop putting her sister&#x27;s desires ahead of her own, and a humiliated Gwen fires her and flounces off. Kiki and Eddie then kiss as the audience applauds.

In the aftermath, Weidmann&#x27;s movie becomes a hit, and Lee resumes his studio job to promote it. Gwen admits to the press that the reconciliation was a lie, blaming her erratic behavior on pain medication before departing with Hector. Eddie and Kiki decide to pursue a relationship, and politely ignoring Lee&#x27;s request to join his promotion efforts, they leave together to travel.

<text>Entrapment is a 1999 heist film directed by Jon Amiel and written by Ronald Bass. It stars Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones and includes Will Patton, Ving Rhames and Maury Chaykin. The film focuses on the relationship between an investigator and a professional thief as they attempt a heist at the turn of the millennium.

Simon West and Antoine Fuqua were both in talks to direct before Amiel was hired. Principal photography took place from June to October 1998 at locations in Britain and Malaysia. The score was composed by Christopher Young, and British singer Seal performs &quot;Lost My Faith&quot; over the end credits.

&quot;Entrapment&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on 30 April 1999 and in the United Kingdom on 2 July. It received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $212 million worldwide on a $66 million production budget.

==Plot==
In December 1999, insurance investigator Virginia &quot;Gin&quot; Baker assesses the theft of a valuable Rembrandt painting from a New York City penthouse. Gin informs her boss, Hector Cruz, that she suspects the involvement of world-class international thief Robert &quot;Mac&quot; MacDougal, an elderly man who steals for the challenge. Cruz assigns her to investigate.

In London, Mac quickly realizes that Gin is following him and confronts her. She claims to be a thief in need of Mac&#x27;s help to steal a valuable Chinese mask from the highly-secure Bedford Palace. After Gin passes his test by obtaining the Palace floorplans, Mac brings her to his isolated Scottish castle to prepare. There, Gin confesses to stealing the Rembrandt, prompting Mac to reveal that he, in turn, intercepted it before it reached her client. The pair train for the heist, clashing over Mac&#x27;s over-preparedness and resisting their mutual attraction. Later, unaware that Mac is listening in, Gin contacts Cruz to explain her plan to entrap Mac.

That night, Mac and Gin break into Bedford Palace and steal the mask. Before they can escape, however, Mac threatens to drown Gin if she does not admit she is trying to arrest him. Gin claims that her insurance job is a cover identity, and she has no intention of arresting him as she needs him for another heist.

In Kuala Lumpur, Gin reveals her plan to infiltrate the Malaysian branch of the International Clearance Bank (ICB) housed in the Petronas Towers. At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the bank&#x27;s global computer system will briefly shut down for thirty seconds to verify its integrity due to the millennium bug. During this window, Gin and Mac plan to use her custom software to siphon small amounts from thousands of corporate transactions into her account. Concerned for Gin&#x27;s safety, Mac attempts to cancel the heist, but his contact, Aaron Thibadeaux, coerces him to proceed and provides Cruz with photos of Mac and Gin in an intimate moment. Cruz confronts Gin for answers, but she convinces him that it is part of her strategy to incriminate Mac.

As the Millennium celebrations commence on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Cruz oversees increased security forces in the Petronas Towers. Gin and Mac hack the surveillance system to conceal their presence and break into the vault housing the ICB system. At the stroke of midnight, Gin&#x27;s software successfully transfers just over $8 billion to her account, but alarms are triggered when she disconnects her laptop. She and Mac evade the pursuing forces and climb to the interlinked second tower across cables of suspended lights, but when the cable snaps, Gin loses her miniature parachute. The pair reach a large ventilation shaft and Mac forces a tearful Gin to escape with his parachute while he remains behind, promising to meet her at Pudu train station.

The following morning, Mac meets Gin at the station, accompanied by Thibadeaux, who reveals himself as a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent. Mac confesses that he was arrested two years earlier and given a deal to avoid jail by entraping Gin, who has long been under FBI suspicion. As a train arrives at the station, Mac reveals that he has fallen in love with Gin, and that he only surrendered $7 billion to the FBI, before slipping her a gun and documents to escape the country. Gin feigns holding Mac at gunpoint and escapes on the train, pursued by the FBI. As Mac sits at the station alone, Gin reappears, having jumped trains mid-station. Happily reunited, Gin proposes their next heist.

==Filming locations==

Principal photography took place from June to October 1998. Filming locations for the film include Blenheim Palace, Savoy Hotel London, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, Borough Market, London, Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull in Scotland, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur (with other filming completed at Pinewood Studios) and the Bukit Jalil LRT station. However, the signage at this station that was used for the movie was Pudu LRT station instead of Bukit Jalil.

==Reception==
The film was a box office success, grossing over $87 million in the US and $212 million worldwide. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A poorly developed plot weighs down any potential chemistry between the movie&#x27;s leads.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. However, critics such as Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; and Desson Howe/Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film. CinemaScore gave the film a &quot;B&quot; grade from an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three of four stars. &quot;It works because it is made stylishly. The plot is put together like a Swiss watch that keeps changing time zones: It is accurate and misleading at once. The film consists of one elaborate caper sequence after another, and it rivals the Bond films in its climactic action sequence. The stunt and f/x work here does a good job... Most of the movie&#x27;s action is just that—action—and not extreme violence.&quot; Ebert noted about Zeta-Jones, &quot;I can only reflect, as I did while watching her in &quot;The Mask Of Zorro,&quot; that while beautiful women are a dime a dozen in the movies, those with fire, flash and humor are a good deal more scarce.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s a tummy-churning tradition of pensionable movie blokes getting paired up with beautiful babes...&quot; complained &quot;OK!&quot; in its review. &quot;We barely believed Sean and Michelle Pfeiffer in &quot;The Russia House&quot;; a decade later, Sean and &quot;Catherine Zeta-Jones?&quot; You gotta be kidding. The film&#x27;s alright-ish.&quot;

===Responses from the Malaysian government===
Following &quot;Entrapment&quot; release in June 1999, the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused the film of presenting a distorted image of Malaysia. Mahathir took issue with the film splicing images of the Petronas Twin Towers with slums from Malacca. The Malaysian Government had assisted Twentieth Century Fox with visa processing, customs clearance, telecommunications and security in a bid to promote Malaysia as a film location.

<doc id="277170" wikidata="Q297957" url="?curid=277170" title="Maumoon Abdul Gayoom">
<text>Maumoon Abdul Gayoom ( ; born Abdulla Maumoon Khairi; 29 December 1937) is a Maldivian politician, statesman, diplomat and scholar who served as the 3rd president of the Maldives from 1978 to 2008. He previously served as the Minister of Transport from 1977 to 1978, and as the Permanent Representative of the Maldives to the United Nations from 1976 to 1977. The longest-serving Maldivian president, Gayoom was the longest-serving leader in Asia.

Gayoom was born and raised in Malé. After serving as a lecturer at the Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria, he returned to the Maldives in 1971 and worked as a teacher at Aminiya School. He was later appointed the manager of shipping department at the government. Gayoom was placed under house arrest in 1973 for criticising the policies of the then-president Nasir. He was later banished to Makunudhoo for four years but was released five months later as part of an amnesty following President Nasir&#x27;s re-election for a second term. In 1974, he was arrested again for his continued criticism of Nasir&#x27;s policies, but after 50 days in jail, he was freed and, in 1975, appointed as Special Undersecretary in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. Gayoom later served as the deputy ambassador of the Maldives to Sri Lanka and was appointed deputy minister of transport under minister Hassan Zareer. After serving as deputy minister, he was appointed Permanent Representative of the Maldives to the United Nations in 1976. Following the vacancy of minister of transport, Gayoom was appointed to the position. As president Nasir chose not to seek re-election, a vote in the Citizen&#x27;s Majlis which selected Gayoom as the candidate. In July 1978, Gayoom won the presidential referendum with 92.96% of the vote.

During his administration, economic policies prioritised infrastructure development and tourism, which significantly boosted the nation&#x27;s economic growth. He introduced educational reforms that expanded access to primary and secondary education and improved healthcare by establishing new health facilities. In response to political unrest and calls for greater democracy, Gayoom initiated constitutional reforms transitioning from a presidential to a semi-presidential system, intending to increase political participation and transparency. However, his presidency faced criticism for restricting political freedoms and suppressing opposition. The 1988 coup attempt prompted a focus on strengthening the armed forces. The 2004 tsunami had a profound impact on his administration, leading to the loss of 62% of the GDP and nearly two decades of development, which reshaped his policies and necessitated extensive reconstruction efforts. Despite challenges, Gayoom&#x27;s long tenure, strict policies, and human rights violations, earned him a reputation as a dictator.

Following his defeat in the 2008 presidential election to Mohamed Nasheed, which marked the Maldives&#x27;s first multi-party elections, Gayoom adopted a low public profile. In 2018, Gayoom was arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the government as a part of the 2018 political crisis, and was sentenced to 19 months in prison for obstructing justice after refusing to cooperate with the police and judiciary. He was placed under house arrest in September 2018 due to health concerns and was released on bail later that month. He was acquitted of all charges in October 2018.
== Early life ==
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was born Abdulla Maumoon Khairi on 29 December 1937, at his father&#x27;s home in Machangoalhi, Malé. He was the first child of Abdul Gayoom Ibrahim and Khadheeja Moosa and the tenth child of Abdul Gayoom. His father was a lawyer and the 7th Attorney General of the Maldives from 1950 to 1951. Gayoom is a descendant of the Hilaalee and Dhiyamigili dynasties, with Arab and African ancestry.

Gayoom spent his early years under the care of his parents at Kaamineege, their family residence. His birth name was Abdulla Maumoon Khairi, and he was familiarly known as Lhaseedi at home, while in school, he was called Abdulla Maumoon. His name was changed to Maumoon Abdul Gayoom due to a clerical mistake during the issuance of his passport for overseas education in 1947. When completing the passport form, an assistant mistakenly combined his commonly used name, &quot;Maumoon&quot;, with his father&#x27;s name, resulting in the name Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.

=== Education ===
Gayoom received his early education through homeschooling, taught by his father, a teacher and scholar. He later attended the then-Saniyya School, studying religion, the Dhivehi language, mathematics, and Maldivian history. In 1947, he received a government scholarship to study abroad. He traveled to Ceylon intending to continue to Egypt but was kept there due to the outbreak of the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. While in Colombo, he continued homeschooling with a private tutor who taught him English.

Gayoom then attended Buonavista College in Galle but later transferred to Royal College, Colombo. After two years in Ceylon, he traveled in March 1950 to Cairo, Egypt, where he studied at Al-Azhar University. He spent six months learning Arabic in the university and later earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in Islamic Sharia and Law. He also obtained a Master&#x27;s of Arts in Shariah and Law and later began preparing a thesis for a PhD in Sharia and Law. However, his plans were interrupted when the Egyptian government ceased financial aid to Maldivian students after the Maldives established diplomatic relations with Israel. Gayoom protested by sending a letter to prime minister Ibrahim Nasir—an act that led to his blacklisting and a ban from entering to the Maldives. The ban was later lifted. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, Gayoom was volunteered to defend Palestine during the Israeli attack on Egypt. He graduated from the Azhar University in 1966.

Gayoom also attended the American University in Cairo, where he furthered his studies in Islamic Sharia and Law and later obtained a secondary-level certificate in English.

=== Marriage and children ===

In 1965, the 27-year old Gayoom met 15-year old Nasreena Ibrahim in Cairo while she was there to study. Four years later, on 14 July 1969, the couple married in Cairo, Egypt, before moving to Nigeria for Gayoom to work at Ahmadu Bello University.

A year after their marriage, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Nasreena welcomed their first children, twins Dunya and Yumna, on 20 March 1970. Their first son, Ahmed Faris, was born in Malé on 31 March 1971, followed by their second son, Mohamed Ghassan, who was born on 12 June 1980 during Gayoom&#x27;s presidential administration.

== Early career ==
=== Career ===

From 1969 to 1971, Gayoom was a lecturer in Islamic studies at Abdullahi Bayero College, then part of Ahmadu Bello University in Kano State, Nigeria.

After serving at the Ahmadu Bello University, Gayoom returned to the Maldives in early 1971. From 1971 to 1972, he taught English, arithmetic, and Islam at Aminiya School in Malé, where he gained popularity among parents. In 1972, he was transferred to the government shipping department, where he served as manager.

In 1974, Gayoom was appointed undersecretary and later became director of the government telecommunications department. Later that year, he was appointed special undersecretary in the office of prime minister Ahmed Zaki. The position ended in March 1975 when Zaki was removed from office, and the prime minister&#x27;s role was abolished. Gayoom then spent time in Colombo before returning to the Maldives, where he was appointed deputy ambassador to Sri Lanka. In 1975, he became undersecretary at the Department of External Affairs.

In 1976, Gayoom was appointed deputy minister of transport and, in September, became the Permanent Representative of the Maldives to the United Nations. He returned to the Maldives in March 1977 and served as minister of transport until November 1978.

==== Minister of Transport (1977–1978) ====
Soon after returning from the United States after serving at the United Nations, Gayoom accepted President Nasir&#x27;s request to serve as Minister of transport. At the time, the position was vacant; Nasir appointed Gayoom as the minister of transport in March 1977. During his tenure, Gayoom focused on improving the country&#x27;s transportation infrastructure.

During his tenure as minister, Gayoom oversaw developments in transportation and aviation in the Maldives. He encouraged the use of engine-powered boats, which were not widely popular among the population at the time. He also contributed to the improvement of Hulhulé Airport by upgrading its systems. Gayoom worked on expanding the aviation sector by increasing flights between the Maldives and international destinations, supporting the growth of the tourism industry and improving travel options for Maldivians. His tenure ended upon his inauguration as president of the Maldives in November 1978.

=== Imprisonments ===
During the early 1970s, efforts were underway to expand the tourism industry in the Maldives, led by president Ibrahim Nasir. Tensions between Gayoom and the authorities—arising from earlier disputes during his time in Egypt—continued to grow. His remarks on alcohol and drugs drew widespread attention and sparked discussions across Malé. The government investigated the matter, placing him under house arrest on 12 March 1973. After a trial, Gayoom was sentenced to four years of banishment on 14 May 1973 and transferred to Makunudhoo Island in Haa Dhaalu Atoll on 21 May. He was released on 13 October 1973 under an amnesty following Nasir&#x27;s re-election, having served five months.

On 28 July 1974, Gayoom was arrested again for continuing to criticise government policies and held in solitary confinement in a Malé prison. After 50 days, he was released in September 1974 and ceased further public criticism.

== Presidential elections ==
=== 1978 presidential election ===
Gayoom was nominated for the presidential election in 1978 by his two brothers-in-law, who proposed his name to parliament. Both then-president Ibrahim Nasir and Gayoom were put forward as candidates to be selected as the sole presidential candidate, with Nasir receiving 41 votes and Gayoom securing 5 votes. However, Nasir decided not to seek a third term due to health concerns. The Citizen&#x27;s Majlis nominated three candidates for the presidency: the Minister of Education and former Vice President Abdul Sattar Moosa Didi, the Minister of Health Moomina Haleem, and the Minister of Transport, Gayoom. In July 1978, the Majlis selected Gayoom as the sole candidate for the election—as required by the constitution.

During his campaign, Gayoom pledged to visit every inhabited island in the Maldives within his first five years in office, if elected. He also promised to develop the tourism sector and improve education across the country.

On 28 July 1978, a public referendum was held, in which Gayoom received 92.96% of the vote, making him president-elect. Following his election, Gayoom faced criticism from the public opposition, who argued he was unfit for the presidency.

=== 1983–1998 presidential elections ===

In the 1983 presidential election, Gayoom was chosen as the sole candidate and was re-elected president on 30 September 1983, receiving 57,913 votes, or 95.62%.

In the 1988 Maldivian presidential election, Gayoom received 69,373 votes and 96.47%. There were 2,537 votes against him.

In the 1993 election, Gayoom and his brother-in-law Ilyas Ibrahim ran for presidency; Gayoom was chosen by the People&#x27;s Majlis as the sole candidate. He received 92.8% of the votes and was elected for a fourth term on 1 October 1993. Gayoom was elected for a fifth term of office on 16 October 1998, receiving 86,504 votes, or 90.90%.

=== 2003 presidential election ===
Gayoom was selected as the candidate for the presidential referendum with the votes of all 50 members of the People&#x27;s Majlis. He secured a sixth term with 90.28% of the vote, amounting to 102,909 ballots in the election. Even with high protests against Gayoom, his victory was widely expected, with the government presenting the outcome as evidence of strong public backing. However, concerns were raised regarding the fairness of the process, as only a single candidate was allowed to seek a popular mandate, and political parties had been banned.

Following the election, it was anticipated by the media, that Gayoom&#x27;s sixth term would be difficult, as there was growing public pressure for a more open and democratic political system.

=== 2008 presidential election ===
In August 2007, Gayoom, during a trip to Laamu Atoll, announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election from the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party. Although according to DRP&#x27;s regulations, he was already the official candidate, as the party&#x27;s leader was automatically nominated for presidential elections. His candidacy was challenged in the Maldivian Supreme Court, as the new constitution stated that a president could serve only two terms, while Gayoom was seeking a seventh term. He contended that his previous terms should not be counted, as they were served under the old constitution. The Supreme Court agreed, stating that the term limits applied only to terms served &quot;under the new constitution,&quot; thus allowing Gayoom to contest the election.

On 5 August 2008, Gayoom chose atoll minister Ahmed Thasmeen Ali as his running mate. Three days afterwards, the presidential campaign began. During the campaign, Gayoom focused on his presidency&#x27;s reforms in education and healthcare, portraying them as key pillars of national progress under his leadership. He pledged to drive further developments in economic and social development to elevate the Maldives. In his criticism of Mohamed Nasheed, his main opposition, Gayoom questioned Nasheed&#x27;s capacity to govern, warning that his policies could undermine the Islamic values that form the foundation of Maldivian society and governance.

Gayoom&#x27;s age concerns also arose during the campaign. During the campaign, the Maldivian Democratic Party accused him of attempting to rig the election and achieve a first-round victory. Several news outlets reported that Gayoom and Nasheed would face each other in a run-off. The election was the first time Gayoom was facing opposition candidates, and the first multi-party elections. Gayoom won the first round of the 2008 Maldivian presidential election with 40.63% of the vote. However, in the second round, he lost to his opponent, Mohamed Nasheed. Gayoom conceded the election the following day in a speech, expressing acceptance of the results and pledging a peaceful transfer of power.

== Presidency (1978–2008) ==
Gayoom was inaugurated as the 3rd president of the Republic of Maldives on 11 November 1978 at 12:00 AM. His oath was administered by judge Moosa Fathhy. One of the first things Gayoom did at the beginning of his administration was upgrading the education and healthcare system in the Maldives.

=== First and second terms (1978–1988) ===
==== 1980 assassination attempt ====
In February 1980, Former president Ibrahim Nasir, along with his brother-in-law Ahmed Naseem, Health Minister Mohamed Musthafa Hussain, and businessman Mohamed Yusuf, hired nine former members of the British Special Air Service (SAS) to carry out an assassination and coup attempt against Gayoom. The mercenaries reportedly operated from a base in Sri Lanka, conducting several reconnaissance trips in preparation for the mission. They were provided with arms and promised a payment of US$60,000 each for their services. However, the assassination attempt was ultimately called off by the SAS operatives due to emerging doubts about the operation.

==== 1987 Great wave ====
On 11 April 1987, a devastating tidal wave, often referred to as the &quot;Great Wave&quot;, struck Malé, leaving 16 islands across 13 atolls severely affected and causing damages estimated at MVR 90 million. The disaster is considered one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in Maldivian history.

In an interview during the early 2000s, Gayoom said:
The wave caused remarkable damage to both the outer and inner seawalls of Malé. In response, the Maldivian government sought assistance from Japan, which sent a team of scientists to assess the situation. The Japanese government later supported the reconstruction of the damaged seawalls, helping the country recover from the disaster.

The event drew international attention to the vulnerabilities of small island nations. Gayoom addressed this issue at the 1987 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, proposing the formation of a group of experts to study the impacts of climate change on small island states and low-lying nations. His proposal was adopted at the meeting. He also brought the issue to the United Nations General Assembly, becoming the first world leader to speak about climate change on a global stage.

==== 1988 coup attempt ====
On 3 November 1988, an attempted coup d&#x27;état was launched against Gayoom by a group of Maldivians, along with armed mercenaries from the Sri Lankan Tamil militant organisation, the People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). The coup was arranged by Abdullah Luthufi, a Maldivian businessman, who sought to overthrow Gayoom&#x27;s government.

Gayoom&#x27;s presidency faced weighty opposition, with key figures like Luthufi determined to remove him from power due to dissatisfaction with the political landscape and the perceived lack of opportunities for dissent. Luthufi believed that an outside force was necessary to facilitate this change, as local electoral processes were deemed ineffective. His close association with the People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) allowed him to negotiate for military support in the form of an 80-member raiding party. Strategic discussions regarding a sea-borne raid began in 1987, influenced by the deployment of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka. Additionally, Luthufi secured support from sympathetic members of the Maldivian military, highlighting the complexities of the political situation during Gayoom&#x27;s rule.

Gayoom reached out to neighbouring and other countries for assistance, contacting India, United Kingdom, United States and Singapore for military aid. Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi responded promptly, and within hours, India launched Operation Cactus. Indian paratroopers were airlifted to the Maldives and landed in Malé on the same day, securing key locations and restoring order. The Indian intervention was decisive, with the coup leaders unable to mount resistance once foreign troops arrived. Many of the PLOTE mercenaries were captured, while others fled the country.

The coup attempt was effectively quashed within hours of the Indian military&#x27;s arrival. The quick resolution of the coup attempt strengthened Gayoom&#x27;s position, and he publicly expressed gratitude towards the Indian government for its timely intervention.

Following the coup attempt, planner Abdulla Lutfi and his assistant Sagar Nasir were sentenced to death. However, according to Gayoom, the sentences were reduced to a life sentence of 25 years. Following the coup attempt, a small number of Indian soldiers remained in Malé for a year to protect Gayoom from further threats.

=== Other terms (1988–2008) ===

==== 2004 tsunami ====


The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was a major turning point in Gayoom&#x27;s presidential administration. In response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, President Gayoom addressed the nation on the evening of the disaster, stating that citizens should work together with the government to recover from the losses.

The tsunami caused extensive devastation, resulting in the loss of more than three decades of development and an estimated 62% of the country&#x27;s GDP and a damage cost of approximately US$460 million. According to World Bank estimates, the Maldives experienced a GDP growth rate of 13.75% in 2003; however, this plummeted to -11.223% in 2004 as a direct consequence of the tsunami. Regardless of various recovery efforts, many damages remained unresolved by the end of Gayoom&#x27;s presidency.

Gayoom declared a state of emergency following the national disaster on the same day, and a special task force was established to deliver aid and supplies. Rescue efforts were hindered by the loss of communication with the nation&#x27;s over 1,000 islands, as well as the lack of sufficient disaster planning.

==== Malé bombing ====
Following the first bomb explosion in Malé on 29 September 2007, which targeted foreign tourists, the government, under the presidency of Gayoom, expressed serious concern over the rising threat of Islamic extremism. In response, the government initiated measures to address religious fundamentalism and militancy; the authorities declared that clerics or mullahs with beards would be prohibited from entering the country unless specifically invited by the government.

==== 2008 assassination attempt ====
On 8 January 2008, Gayoom was visiting Hoarafushi in Haa Alif Atoll. Mohamed Murshid attempted to stab Gayoom in the stomach with a kitchen knife; however, the attack was thwarted by Mohamed Jaisham Ibrahim, a 16-year-old boy scout from Kudahuvadhoo, who intervened and blocked the attack with his own hands. Jaisham sustained injuries during this act and required medical treatment, later being treated at Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital. Following the incident, Gayoom stated, &quot;By the grace of Almighty Allah, I am well and safe, but severe injuries have been inflicted on this brave young man from this island, Mohamed Jaisham. He is a true hero. I sincerely thank him and his family, and I pray to Almighty Allah for his speedy recovery.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Palestine and Israel ====
During his presidency, Gayoom took a firm stance on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which was a defining feature of his foreign policy. Within a week of taking office in 1978, Gayoom severed the diplomatic relations with Israel that had been established under the previous administration of Ibrahim Nasir. Gayoom supported for an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. He argued that this move was necessary to align with the Maldives&#x27; broader support for Palestinian self-determination. In 1984, Gayoom invited Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the Maldives, and he undertook a state visit in July the same year.

Gayoom also attempted economic partnerships to strengthen ties with Palestine. His administration launched &quot;Maldives Airways&quot; in collaboration with the Palestinian government, with a fleet of four airplanes. However, the airline faced financial challenges, attributed to international sanctions and economic pressure, which led to its bankruptcy by 1984. Due to the airline&#x27;s failure, Gayoom&#x27;s administration continued efforts to support Palestine through other means, such as organising nationwide fundraising campaigns, with donation boxes set up throughout the Maldives.

==== South and East Asia ====
During Gayoom&#x27;s presidency, his foreign policy towards South and East Asia was centered on strengthening ties with key regional players, particularly India, China, and Japan.

Gayoom maintained a close relationship with India, which was pivotal during the 1988 coup attempt when India responded with &quot;Operation Cactus&quot; to retain his government. Gayoom sought to balance the Maldives&#x27; foreign policy by establishing ties with China, especially as China&#x27;s influence in the Indian Ocean grew through infrastructure investments and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Relationships demonstrated Gayoom&#x27;s pragmatic approach to foreign policy, ensuring the Maldives benefitted from both regional powers without becoming overly dependent on one. China&#x27;s growing presence was evident in infrastructure projects such as airports and bridges, but the administration was careful to avoid granting military footholds to Beijing, which would have alarmed India.

In October 1984, Gayoom made the first visit to China by a Maldivian head of state since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1972. The visit was made at the invitation of Chinese president. Upon touching down, Gayoom was greeted by Chinese president Li Xiannian. During the trip, an agreement on economic and technical cooperation was signed between the governments of China and the Maldives.

==== Africa and the Middle East ====
Gayoom&#x27;s tenure as president saw the Maldives strengthening ties with African nations, particularly through multilateral organisations such as the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations, where he sought cooperation on shared challenges, such as climate change and development initiatives. He established relations with more than 25 countries in the African continent, during his presidential administration. He strongly advocated for the complete and rapid eradication of apartheid and supported the South African people&#x27;s right to self-determination. His vocal opposition to apartheid strengthened the Maldives&#x27; standing in international forums, where he consistently called for the end of racial oppression and supported liberation movements in Africa.

In the Middle East, Gayoom prioritised relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Saudi Arabia was a crucial ally, providing financial aid, religious scholarships, and investments that supported the Maldives&#x27;s development. Diplomatic exchanges between the two nations were frequent, and the relationship was anchored in Islamic solidarity. Gayoom&#x27;s government also sought to deepen ties with other Gulf countries like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. These partnerships focused on economic cooperation, with the Gulf states contributing to various infrastructure projects in the Maldives. In 1981, Gayoom established diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and the Maldives in history.

==== United States and Europe ====

In the realm of security, the Maldives sought to strengthen ties with the United States to enhance its own national security and regional stability. Given its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives was seen as an important partner in U.S. efforts to combat piracy and terrorism in the region. Gayoom&#x27;s government actively cooperated with the U.S. on maritime security initiatives and participated in international discussions concerning security challenges. This cooperation was mutually beneficial, as it provided the Maldives with increased visibility on the global stage while aligning with U.S. interests in ensuring a secure maritime environment.

During the presidency of Gayoom, relations between the Maldives and the United States were marked by cooperation and economic support. The U.S. contributed to the Maldives&#x27;s economic development mainly through international organisation programmes. Following the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the two countries signed a bilateral assistance agreement, providing $8.6 million for reconstruction efforts. This aid was directed towards rebuilding harbours, sewage systems, and electrical generation facilities, while also helping the Ministry of Finance improve its capacity to manage and absorb international assistance.

During his presidency, the Maldives established and nurtured strong relations with various European countries, particularly in the areas of trade, tourism, and development cooperation. The Maldives became an attractive destination for European tourists, which boosted its economy and helped the nation diversify its income sources. European nations, particularly the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, played a crucial role in promoting Maldivian tourism, contributing to the growth of the hospitality industry and infrastructure development.

==== International trips ====
Gayoom made a number of visits to more than 35 countries during his 30 years of presidency. His first visit following first inauguration, was to Libya to attend 1 September revolution celebrations in the country. He became the first Maldivian president to visit Libya, Senegal and South Africa. At the end of his presidency, Gayoom had visited India over sixteen times in various capacities, making him the Maldivian president with the most visits to India.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Health and education policy ====
Education and healthcare policies were one of the most important–focused subjects during the presidential administration of Gayoom.

When Gayoom became president in 1978, the Maldives lacked a formal education system beyond the capital Malé, although two secondary schools and basic educational infrastructure existed there. In early 1979, his government conducted a study that revealed 24.77% of the population was illiterate. In response, the government launched the &quot;Basic Education Project&quot; in January 1980, aimed at eradicating illiteracy. The project began the following month, with the start of teaching basic education classes. Over time, the initiative reduced the illiteracy rate, bringing it down to 1.06% by 1999. Gayoom made education a key priority, aiming to expand access across the country. His government began by establishing primary schools in the atolls, with Gayoom personally inaugurating the first in South Miladhunmadulu Atoll in March 1979, months after assuming office.

A national curriculum was introduced, and efforts were made to provide seven years of primary education to Maldivian children. Additionally, two secondary schools were established in the atolls, reducing the need for students to move to Malé for higher education. The number of students sitting for the General Certificate of Education (GCE) ordinary Level examinations grew from 102 in 1978 to 6,495 in 2002. Total student enrolment increased from around 15,000 in 1978 to 97,323 in 1998, and the literacy rate improved from 70% to 98.82% by the same year. By 1999, 254 schools with 2,646 teachers were providing education up to Grade 10.

Gayoom&#x27;s administration introduced many healthcare reforms in the late 1970s, when the Maldives had limited medical facilities, including just one small hospital and basic health services. His government prioritised improving maternal and child health, contributing to an increase in life expectancy from 48 years in 1978 to 71 years by 1998. Universal immunisation was achieved by 1990, and the government implemented measures to combat communicable diseases. Gayoom&#x27;s administration also launched public health campaigns promoting healthy living, balanced diets, and the risks of tobacco consumption.

By 1998, the physician to population ratio had improved from one per 20,700 people in 1978 to one per 1,300, and hospital bed capacity increased nearly tenfold.

==== Human rights policy ====
Gayoom&#x27;s presidency was marked by controversy, particularly regarding human rights issues. International human rights organisations and foreign governments have accused his administration of employing tactics against dissidents, including arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, forced confessions, and politically motivated killings. Reports indicated that security forces were sometimes used to intimidate opposition figures.

Criticism of Gayoom&#x27;s governance came from various quarters, including foreign nations such as those within the European Union and the Commonwealth of Nations, which expressed concerns over his long-term rule and described it as autocratic. Critics highlighted issues related to the abuse of power, and some characterised his leadership style as dictatorial, pointing to limitations on political freedoms. The complex nature of his legacy continues to be a topic of discussion, with supporters citing developmental achievements while critics emphasise human rights violations.

Towards the end of his presidency, Gayoom apologised for his actions, saying:
==== Economic policy ====

During the Gayoom&#x27;s administration, tourism became the largest industry in the Maldives, a status it continues to hold. By the 1980s, tourism accounted for 28% of the nation&#x27;s GDP and more than 60% of its foreign exchange receipts. This sector played a critical role in driving economic growth, with GDP per capita expanding by 265% during the 1980s and a further 115% in the 1990s. The tourism industry&#x27;s rapid development underpinned the Maldives&#x27; economic success, and this expansion provided a steady source of income and foreign currency, which helped to stabilise the economy during Gayoom&#x27;s rule.

Under Gayoom&#x27;s leadership, the tourism industry was restructured in 1979 with the introduction of the Tourism Act, which established regulations to manage entry into the sector through capacity control. These measures improved standards in existing resorts and increased profitability. By the end of the 20th century, tourism became a vital part of the Maldivian economy, contributing to GDP and providing a crucial source of foreign currency.

Gayoom&#x27;s government initiated economic reforms in 1989, aimed at liberalising the economy. These reforms included lifting import quotas and opening certain sectors for export to private enterprises. The liberalisation also extended to foreign investment regulations, encouraging more international involvement in the Maldivian economy. The nation&#x27;s GDP grew rapidly, with the gross domestic product rising from MVR 440 million in 1980 to MVR 10,458 million by 2005, according to International Monetary Fund estimates.

Throughout the 1980s, the Maldivian economy experienced relatively low inflation, with real GDP growth averaging around 10%. The year 1990 saw an exceptional GDP growth rate of 16.2%, although this figure declined to 4% by 1993. Due to slowdown, the economy continued to perform strongly, with an average real GDP growth of over 7.5% per year from 1995 to 2004. The sustained growth during this period was largely driven by a combination of tourism, fishing, and increased foreign investment, which helped the country weather regional economic challenges.

The Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, however, caused a sharp contraction in the economy, with the GDP loss of approximately 62%; the Maldivian economy demonstrated resilience, rebounding strongly with a 13% growth rate in 2006. The recovery was driven by a revival in tourism and infrastructure development efforts, supported by international aid and investments. Under Gayoom&#x27;s administration, the Maldives managed to maintain steady economic growth, regardless of external shocks, while fostering a more open and diversified economy.

==== Environmental policies ====
During his presidency, Gayoom was a strong advocate for environmental protection and climate diplomacy, both nationally and internationally. His administration became one of the first to bring international attention to the potential consequences of climate change for low-lying nations. In 1987, following severe flooding that inundated much of the capital, Malé, Gayoom recognised the looming threat posed by rising sea levels and environmental degradation. He became the first–ever world leader to address the United Nations General Assembly on the dangers of climate change, urging urgent global action on what was, at the time, still a relatively unknown issue.

Gayoom&#x27;s landmark &quot;Death of a Nation&quot; speech at the UNGA is often credited as one of the earliest and most influential calls for global cooperation in combating climate change. His warnings about the vulnerability of small island nations like the Maldives highlighted the risks posed by global warming and sea level rise, issues that were not widely recognised at the time. This intervention marked the beginning of the Maldives&#x27; active participation in global climate diplomacy, reinforcing the nation&#x27;s commitment to advocating for the protection of environmentally fragile states on the international stage.

In addition to his efforts within the Maldives, Gayoom also spearheaded regional environmental cooperation. Under his leadership, the Maldives played an important role in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Study on causes and consequences of natural disasters and the Protection and Preservation of the Environment. It helped build regional awareness of environmental risks, particularly in relation to natural disasters and the long-term impacts of environmental degradation. Gayoom&#x27;s focus on regional cooperation helped to enhance the Maldives&#x27; preparedness for climate-related challenges. In 1989, the Maldives hosted the first Small States Conference on Sea Level Rise, signing the &quot;Malé Declaration on Global Warming and Sea Level Rise&quot;, a treaty urging nations to recognise sea level rise as a global security threat and take urgent action to mitigate its impacts. In 2007, representatives of Small Island Developing States signed the &quot;Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change&quot;, a treaty signed by representatives of Small Island Developing States to highlight the critical links between climate change and human rights.

Furthermore, Gayoom&#x27;s government initiated the SAARC Study on the Greenhouse effect and its impact on the region.
In 1989, Gayoom initiated the Commonwealth Study on Climate Change, which focused on the effects of global warming on Commonwealth nations, particularly small island states. The study, reviewed in 1991, highlighted the pressing need for international cooperation in addressing the challenges posed by rising sea levels and other environmental threats. Gayoom&#x27;s proactive approach in commissioning and participating of climate-change and environmental topics helped establish the Maldives as a global leader in climate diplomacy and advocacy for small island states.

==== Political reforms ====
A month after Gayoom assumed presidency, the Citizen&#x27;s Majlis passed the bill to amend the constitution. By 1980, Gayoom declared to form a special constitutional assembly, consisting of cabinet members and parliamentarians, to amend the constitution. After an 18-year process, the amended constitution was finalised, and by November 1997, Gayoom ratified the constitution. In 1998, the new constitution came info effect—declaring the Maldives a democratic republic (though it did not fully follow democratic principles).
In June 2004, Gayoom launched the &quot;democratic reform agenda&quot; in response to growing calls for political liberalisation and greater civil liberties. Over the following years, notable progress was made — a National Human Rights Commission adhering to international standards was established, political parties were introduced for the first time in 2005, media freedom was granted, and the criminal justice system was modernised.

In 2007, after several rounds of negotiations with opposition parties, particularly the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), an agreement was reached. The MDP pledged not to engage in violence, while the government committed to releasing political detainees and accelerating the reform process. Concerns over the pace of reforms remained, with some doubting the government&#x27;s full commitment to change.

By 2008, Gayoom emphasised the progress achieved through his reform agenda. The drafting of a new constitution was nearing completion, aimed at facilitating the transition to a fully liberal democracy. The new constitution introduced a clearer separation of powers, stronger human rights protections, and established independent institutions, including an autonomous Elections Commission and a Supreme Court.

This constitution, finalised later 2008, marked a turning point in Maldivian political history. It introduced a multi-party system, limited the presidency to two five-year terms, and created the framework for greater transparency and accountability. Gayoom&#x27;s administration also prepared for the country&#x27;s first multi-party presidential election, proposing legislative reforms to guarantee the elections met international standards.

== Post-presidency (2008–present) ==
Following the inauguration of Mohamed Nasheed on 11 November 2008, Gayoom moved to his private residence in Malé.
Gayoom made regular appearances at various events throughout the Malé city, until his imprisonment in 2018, and remained low public profile ever since.

In 2010, Gayoom established his non-profit organisation, &quot;the Maumoon Foundation&quot;, to support initiatives aimed at improving the livelihoods of the Maldivian people, utilising his resources, contacts, and experience.

In January 2010, Gayoom announced he would be retiring from Maldivian politics. Gayoom returned to politics in 2011 after resigning from the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party, which he had established. He cited corruption within the party&#x27;s leadership as his primary reason for leaving, following disputes with the then party leader, Ahmed Thasmeen Ali. In early 2011, Gayoom formed a political faction within the DRP known as the Z-DRP, reflecting growing dissent over the party&#x27;s direction. On 4 September 2011, Gayoom officially announced his resignation from the DRP, declaring that the Z-DRP would evolve into a new party that prioritised integrity and was independent of the DRP&#x27;s influences. In September 2011, plans were revealed by Gayoom, for the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM). The PPM received formal approval from the Elections Commission in October 2011.

In 2016, a leadership dispute emerged between Abdulla Yameen and Gayoom, leading to rapid changes within the Progressive Party of Maldives. Tensions escalated when Gayoom faced challenges to his authority within the party. In 2017, PPM members voted to remove Gayoom as the party leader. Legal actions were initiated by two Members of Parliament, Ahmed Shiyam and Mohamed Shahid, who filed a case in the Civil Court to formally oust Gayoom from his leadership position.

In 2019, Gayoom announced his intention to establish a new political party, the Maldives Reform Movement. Following its establishment, he was appointed the interim president. Gayoom&#x27;s son, Ahmed Faris Maumoon was later elected as the president and leader of the Maldives Reform Movement. During the 2021 MRM primaries, Gayoom ran for the party&#x27;s leader position. He was elected by acclamation as the leader of the party.

=== Views on later presidents and diplomacy ===

Gayoom made a number of visits to countries as a special envoy of the president of the Maldives. After his half-brother Abdulla Yameen won the 2013 election, they had a good relationship at the time, where Yameen sent Gayoom to represent him in different meetings and conferences. One month after Yameen assumed presidency, Gayoom presented a letter from Yameen to the then-former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. In 2014, Gayoom undertook an official visit to Samoa as a special envoy of the president at the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States.

During the Chinese Communist Party leader and Chinese president Xi Jinping&#x27;s state visit to the Maldives in 2014, Gayoom held a meeting with him. Gayoom also sent condolences to former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, representing Yameen in 2015. In July that year, he undertook an official visit to Oman as special envoy of the president and met with officials to discuss on improving bilateral relations between Oman and the Maldives.

==== Views on presidents ====
Gayoom was a vocal critic of the Mohamed Nasheed administration, often opposing its policies and governance style. He and his supporters accused Nasheed&#x27;s government of economic mismanagement. Gayoom also raised concerns about Nasheed&#x27;s approach to religion and democracy, arguing that it risked undermining traditional values. During 2011–12, Gayoom and supporters protested, which president Nasheed and the government described as &quot;violent&quot; and a &quot;coup&quot;. Later the protests became an unrest, leading to the resignation of president Mohamed Nasheed.

Though he praised President Yameen in the early part of his tenure, after 2015, relations between Gayoom and his half-brother Abdulla Yameen began to deteriorate, with the two ceasing communication following political disagreements and a leadership dispute within Gayoom&#x27;s Progressive Party of Maldives. In 2017, Gayoom apologised for supporting Abdulla Yameen in the 2013 presidential election, expressing regret for his role in Yameen&#x27;s rise to power.

During the Ibrahim Mohamed Solih administration, Gayoom did not majorly critique the administration but commented on specific issues, expressing dissatisfaction with certain aspects.

=== Presidential politics ===

After Gayoom lost the 2008 presidential election and the inauguration of Mohamed Nasheed, Gayoom did not majorly react to Nasheed administration in the first years. In the 2013 presidential election, many Maldivian citizens gave the opinion for Gayoom to run in the elections, however he declared in February 2013 that he would not run any further presidential elections. Later then Progressive Party of Maldives held its primary elections and was won by Gayoom&#x27;s half-brother Abdulla Yameen, in which he endorsed Yameen.

In the 2018 presidential elections, Gayoom endorsed Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, while Yameen was running; the decision was made following the imprisonment of Gayoom by Yameen in 2018.

During the 2023 presidential election, Gayoom&#x27;s elder son Ahmed Faris Maumoon was running as an independent candidate after Elections Commission rejected his candidacy as a Maldives Reform Movement candidate due to lack of members in the party. Gayoom endorsed Faris and his running mate Abdul Sattar Yoosuf in the elections.

=== Arrest and imprisonment ===


On 5 February 2018, Gayoom was arrested for planning to overthrow his half-brother Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom&#x27;s government, along with his son-in-law, Mohamed Nadheem. His arrest occurred amid an emergency martial law declared by then-President Abdulla Yameen, who justified the actions by alleging a conspiracy and coup attempt. International and nationwide reactions came quickly; Maldivians started protesting the following day as the government declared state emergency.

Shortly before his arrest, Gayoom posted a video message on Twitter, stating, &quot;I have not done anything to be arrested. I urge you to remain steadfast in your resolve too. We will not give up on the reform work we are doing&quot;. Media reported that Gayoom and his son Faris were being tortured by not being allowed medical treatment.

On 13 June 2018, Gayoom was sentenced to 19 months in prison for &quot;obstructing justice&quot; after refusing to cooperate with the Maldives police and the judiciary following his arrest. In September 2018, he was placed under house arrest due to health concerns. Gayoom was released on bail on 30 September 2018 and was acquitted on 18 October 2018.

==== Reactions ====

International organisations, including the United Nations, expressed concern over the political situation, condemning the arrest as part of a broader &quot;attack on democracy&quot; in the Maldives. The UN urged the Maldivian government to respect judicial independence and fundamental freedoms, criticising the suppression of dissent and the crackdown on political opponents. Human rights groups also voiced their opposition to Gayoom&#x27;s detention, calling for his immediate release and for the government to uphold democratic norms.

Domestically, Gayoom&#x27;s arrest deepened the political divide in the country. Opposition leaders, including former President Mohamed Nasheed, condemned the arrest and called for international intervention. Nasheed appealed to India and the United States to step in, asserting that Yameen&#x27;s actions threatened the rule of law and democratic governance in the Maldives. It is widely believed that the crisis resulted to Yameen&#x27;s defeat in the 2018 presidential election.

== Public image ==
Gayoom is regarded as one of the most influential figures in Maldivian history. At years old, he is the oldest living former president and is the earliest-serving living former president since the death of Ibrahim Nasir in 2008. Gayoom&#x27;s leadership has left an important mark on the country&#x27;s political landscape.

Gayoom was seen as a moderniser and a stabilising force in the Maldives. His leadership brought remarkable advancements in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, earning him substantial support among Maldivians. Many viewed him as a visionary leader who played a crucial role in bringing the Maldives into the modern era and fostering economic growth. His tenure is often credited with elevating the country&#x27;s global standing and improving the quality of life for its citizens. His presidency is also often referred to as &quot;Golden 30 years&quot;.

However, Gayoom&#x27;s long rule also attracted considerable criticism, particularly regarding his administration&#x27;s handling of political dissent and human rights. Critics accused his government of authoritarian practices, including suppressing opposition voices and restricting freedoms of expression. Allegations contributed to a divided view of his leadership, with some seeing him as a benevolent ruler who maintained stability, while others viewed him as an autocratic leader resistant to democratic reforms.

Although facing accusations of authoritarianism, Gayoom hinted that he was not an authoritarian, stating:
A 2024 poll by the organisation Maahdhaa4 ranks him as a top-performing president. In the years following his presidency, Gayoom&#x27;s role in politics has continued to shape his public perception. He is often regarded as a senior statesman, maintaining remarkable influence in the political sphere. While his supporters continue to view him as the &quot;father of the modern Maldives&quot;, Gayoom has been described by journalists, politicians, and organisations as a dictator, autocrat, an authoritarian, and a strongman. During his presidency, the opposition referred to him as &quot;Golhaaboa&quot; to criticise his leadership, while his supporters called him &quot;Zaeem&quot;, meaning &quot;leader&quot;.

=== Health ===
Gayoom&#x27;s health has been a concern in recent years, particularly during his time in jail. He had been diagnosed with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. On 13 September 2018, his health deteriorated while he was incarcerated, leading to a visit to the doctor at Maafushi Jail for treatment. The attending physician recommended that Gayoom be placed under house arrest due to difficulties in performing essential activities. An ENT doctor advised him to avoid moving his head to prevent further complications due to Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Medical professionals indicated that his health could worsen at any moment, underscoring the seriousness of his condition during his imprisonment. In August 2020, Gayoom tested positive for COVID-19. He has remained in good health thereafter.

=== Other activities ===
An avid reader, Gayoom is known for his deep engagement with literature, particularly in the areas of religion, science, and history during his post-presidency. His fascination with astronomy has been a notable aspect of his personal interests, and he has spent remarkable
time studying the moon and celestial bodies. His passion for photography and calligraphy also stands out, with Gayoom being a skilled calligrapher known for his work in Arabic script. His calligraphic works has been displayed at the Islamic Centre since 1984. Gayoom is also a poet and writer.

Gayoom is an enthusiastic sportsman, with a particular interest in badminton and cricket. He actively played both sports during his presidency and beyond, maintaining a strong connection to physical activity. His role as an Islamic scholar further complements his diverse range of interests, as he often engages in discussions and lectures on religious matters during his free time.

Gayoom&#x27;s interest in astronomy began during his time teaching in Nigeria in 1969. The clear night skies allowed him to notice that the moon&#x27;s setting direction shifted over the course of the month, contrary to his assumption that it followed a constant path. This observation led him to consult small astronomy books, which provided a basic understanding but left him aware of the limitations of the information available.

=== Religion ===
Gayoom is a Sunni Muslim. The constitution of the Maldives states all Maldivian citizens shall be Sunni Muslim. Many people accuse Gayoom of not being a Sunni Muslim, but rather a Shia Muslim, or of not being a Muslim by faith.

During the 2008 Maldivian presidential election, the Adhaalath Party challenged Gayoom in the Supreme Court as a constitutional matter, citing his past statements that could suggest he was not a Sunni Muslim, which would disqualify him from running for president under the constitutional requirement that the president must be a Sunni Muslim. The Supreme Court, upon dismissing the case, stated that the Adhaalath Party had failed to provide sufficient evidence to determine that Gayoom was not a Sunni Muslim.

== Awards and honors ==

Gayoom received several notable awards and honours throughout his career. In 1988, he was included in the Global 500 Roll of Honour by the United Nations Environment Programme. He was presented with the Man of the Sea Award for 1990 by the Lega Navale Italiana in 1991 and the International Environment Award by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit in 1998. Gayoom also received The Energy and Resources Institute&#x27;s Sustainable Development Leadership Award in 2008.

In recognition of his contributions to international relations, Gayoom was awarded the Grand Order of Mugunghwa by South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan in 1984, and in 1997, Queen Elizabeth II conferred upon him the title of Knight Grand Cross of St Michael and St George. His efforts in public health were acknowledged with the WHO Health-for-All Gold Medal in 1998.

Other notable accolades include the Shield of Al-Azhar University in 2002, the Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana in 2008, and the Order of the Distinguished Rule of Ghazi, the highest state honour awarded by the Maldives, awarded to him in 2013. In 2015, Gayoom was awarded the Golden Jubilee Shield of Honour by the State for his exceptional national service in safeguarding, defending, and strengthening the full independence of the Maldives over the preceding 50 years. In 2022, Gayoom was awarded the President&#x27;s Tourism Gold Award. He received lifetime achievement the same year.

<text>Haberdashers&#x27; Adams Grammar School is a selective state grammar school for high-achieving boys and girls aged 11–18 with boarding for boys, located in Newport, Shropshire, offering day and boarding education. As of 2024, boarding fees are £14,553 per year for years 7-11 and £15,954 per year for Sixth Form. Haberdashers&#x27; Adams was founded in 1656 by William Adams, a wealthy member of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers (one of the Great Twelve Livery Companies of the City of London). In January 2018, the school changed its name from Adams&#x27; Grammar School to Haberdashers&#x27; Adams. In July 2022, the school announced that it would become fully co-educational, starting from September 2024.

==History==

Haberdashers&#x27; Adams was founded in 1656 by Alderman William Adams, a wealthy City of London merchant and haberdasher, who was born in Newport. Adams had no children and never married, so therefore decided to leave a bequest for the foundation of the school, which was first opened on 25 March 1656, during the politically unstable and volatile period of the English Interregnum. Having received permission from Oliver Cromwell to found the school, Adams sought to further ensure the school&#x27;s continued existence by appointing the Master and Wardens of the Haberdashers&#x27; Company as governors in perpetuity. As one of the few schools founded during the Interregnum period, the school&#x27;s articles of foundation were reconfirmed by Act of Parliament in 1660 (12 Cha. 2. c. &quot;12&quot;), upon the Restoration of the Monarchy; a copy of which is held in the school archives.

Adams endowed the school with a large agricultural estate at Knighton in Staffordshire, providing income for future generations; as a result of this, Knighton was exempt from all land taxes until 1990. The school was endowed with 1,400 books soon after its foundation, which at the time represented one of the largest school libraries in England. Only seven of these books are still in the school&#x27;s ownership, with the rest having been sold at various times when the school has suffered financial hardship.

The Knighton estate was eventually sold off in several portions over the course of the twentieth century, and the proceeds of the final sale were used by the Haberdashers&#x27; Company to purchase Longford Hall as a boarding house for the school.

Haberdashers&#x27; Adams developed slowly, and did not expand beyond its original building, now known as &quot;Big School&quot;, until the turn of the last century, when &quot;Main School&quot; (also known as the &quot;S-Block&quot;) was built in the 1920s. Over the course of the next 90 years Adams&#x27; expanded rapidly, acquiring a number of buildings on Lower Bar in Newport for use as boarding houses; this in turn greatly expanded the school&#x27;s town centre site. In the 1960s a new science block, connected to Main School was built, whilst a senior boarding master&#x27;s house was created on land adjacent to Big School. During this period the school also built a new gymnasium, which was subsequently converted into a theatre in the mid-2000s. It has since been converted into a Sixth Form Common area following the construction of the New music block. 

During the First World War, 362 Old Novaportans (former pupils) served in the Armed Forces, of whom 45 died and 77 survived wounded. After the War a memorial fund was set up to assist the sons of the deceased, and an appeal raised £1,000. A tablet listing those who died was unveiled in the Main School building in 1921. In 1948, the Old Boys&#x27; Club erected another tablet alongside this to those who died in the Second World War. Both memorials are now displayed in the School Library.

In the modern era, the school&#x27;s status has been expressed in a number of statutory arrangements. In 1950 the school became a voluntary aided school then after a brief spell as a grant-maintained school in the 1980s, Adams again faced threat of closure or conversion to co-educational comprehensive status in the early 1990s; this was avoided by a successful campaign, organised by parents and governors, against the wishes of Shropshire County Council. In the late 1990s and 2000s Haberdashers&#x27; Adams again enjoyed voluntary-aided status; throughout its history the Haberdashers&#x27; Company has been key in supporting the school&#x27;s vision and offering financial support for some of the more ambitious construction projects.

In 1993, girls were admitted to the sixth form for the first time, bringing to an end Haberdashers&#x27; Adams&#x27; long tradition of educating boys only. The 1990s also saw the construction of the Wood and Taylor Centres for the study of design technology and maths. The Maths block has since been changed to an English block following the construction of the new Paddock block, reflecting the school&#x27;s status in the later 1990s as a technology college. In the early 2000s, the school began to raise funds for the construction of a new state-of-the-art sports hall and fitness suite to replace dilapidated facilities. The Paddock Block was constructed in 2019 to contain Maths, Art and a new hall was built to accommodate the expansion of the school to include the new Sa&#x27;adu house. 

In 2002, a history of the school by former headmaster David Taylor and his wife, Ruth, was published. 

The late 2000s saw the school celebrate its 350th anniversary (in 2006), completion of a new science block and conversion of the former gymnasium into a performing arts centre (this, in turn, was converted into a Sixth Form Centre, which opened in 2013). The dilapidated music department was condemned for health and safety reasons in 2006; The Coach House, on Salters Lane, which backs onto the school grounds, was acquired by the Haberdashers&#x27; Company and converted into a new music department, which opened in 2013 alongside the new Sixth Form Centre.

In 2007, Haberdashers&#x27; Adams&#x27; Federation Trust (HAFT) was created in order to join Adams&#x27; Grammar School with the re-built Abraham Darby School (which later became Haberdashers&#x27; Abraham Darby Academy) in a loose federation. Under this trust, both schools would share the same board of governors. In September 2011, Adams&#x27; Grammar School was converted into an academy under the 2010 Academies Act and the federation was amended so that both schools would be combined under the ownership of HAFT. HAFT was later renamed as Haberdashers&#x27; West Midlands Academies Trust. In September 2023, the Haberdashers&#x27; West Midlands Academies Trust was joined by Castle House School, an independent preparatory day school in Newport, which subsequently became known as Haberdashers&#x27; Castle House.

In 2014, the school was publicly criticised by a former pupil who claimed that there was a culture of racism, sexism, and homophobia among students and staff and that &quot;the fundamental doctrine that Adams&#x27; taught was that we should define ourselves by our perceived superiority to others&quot;. This was disputed strongly by the school&#x27;s headmaster along with a number of former students.

In 2018, headmaster Gary Hickey changed the school&#x27;s name from Adams&#x27; Grammar School to Haberdashers&#x27; Adams. This was reportedly done in order to reflect the school&#x27;s &quot;historic links&quot; with the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers.

In 2023, a decision was announced that girls would be admitted into year 7 for the first time, and in September 2024, the first intake of year 7 girls started studying at the school. 

== Admissions and performance==
Haberdashers&#x27; Adams is a selective school which admits both boarding and day pupils.

===Academic performance===
In 2022, Haberdashers&#x27; Adams was downgraded to Good by Ofsted. Ofsted noted that the &quot;effectiveness of leadership and management requires improvement&quot; and that staff &quot;are not receiving effective regular supervision&quot;. The school was not compliant with regard to a number of safeguarding principles, including failure to fulfil the basic safer recruitment of staff and volunteers. In relation to the boarding provision, Ofsted noted that the school &quot;does not meet the national minimum standards for boarding schools relating to staffing and supervision and complaints. The school has been scored as average with a Progress 8 score of −0.02 by the Department for Education. 

== School life ==

As of November 2016 the headmaster is Gary Hickey, who was previously deputy headmaster of the school. He is set to be replaced as headmaster by the current Deputy Head for student welfare, Daniel Biggins, in September 2025.

=== House system ===
Haberdashers&#x27; Adams operates an extra-curricular house system and is the basis of inter-house sports competitions, traditionally a source of pride for pupils of their respective houses (all named after Shropshire-born notables):

* &quot;Owen House&quot;, named after Wilfred Owen, one of the leading poets of the First World War (born near Oswestry) sports scarlet as its colours. This house was called Clive House after Robert Clive of India until 2021 when it was renamed after criticism arose of Robert Clive in light of the George Floyd protests.
* &quot;Darwin House&quot;, traditionally sports royal blue and is named after Shrewsbury-born Charles Darwin, the celebrated 19th-century naturalist.
* &quot;Talbot House&quot;, the last of the three original &quot;Salopian&quot; houses, traditionally displays black and white (arranged in hoops, &quot;e.g.&quot; on rugby jerseys) as its sporting colours; it is named after Whitchurch-born &quot;Old Talbot&quot; (Sir John Talbot, &quot;later&quot; Earl of Shrewsbury) of the famous local Talbot family and one of the foremost English military commanders of the French medieval wars.
* &quot;Webb House&quot;, was founded in 1994 by Robert Mulhern and assumed emerald green as its distinguishing colours; it is named after Dawley-born merchant naval officer and accomplished swimmer, Captain Matthew Webb. 
* &quot;Sa&#x27;adu House&quot;, the newest house being announced in 2020 and being formed in the school year starting 2021, named after NHS worker and Old Novaportan who died during the COVID-19 pandemic, Alfa Sa&#x27;adu, assuming purple as its house colour.

Throughout the academic year there are many house events at Haberdashers&#x27; Adams, revolving around the arts, sports or academic subjects. These include the House Music Competition; Dixon Cup, which covers drama and public speaking; Smedley Cup and House 7s, which are both rugby competitions; and other sports competitions such as House Cross Country and House Swimming. Intra-house geography, history, poetry and languages competitions also take place.

=== Boarding houses and student leadership ===
The school owns a number of dedicated boarding houses. The present junior hall (Longford Hall) is located by the school&#x27;s playing fields about a mile away. In 2017 the Haberdashers&#x27; enabled the school to purchase and re-furbish Beaumaris Court, a former care home, to become the school&#x27;s new senior boarding house, Beaumaris Hall. This new facility replaced the three senior boys&#x27; boarding houses which were situated in large Georgian townhouses facing the High Street.

Longford Hall was built in 1785 for Colonel Ralph Leeke, political agent to the British East India Company; the building was designed by Joseph Bonomi, who was an associate of Robert and James Adam.
The hall is located on top of a low rise and overlooks farmland towards the Lilleshall Monument. As with many such buildings, the first 100 feet in front of the hall comprises manicured grass, bordered by a ha-ha to prevent animals from entering; today the ha-ha is best known amongst pupils for forming a part of the school&#x27;s annual house cross-country course. There are a small series of formal gardens, including a &quot;Quad&quot;. Behind the hall is a selection of buildings around a central square including a dovecote, once part of the estate&#x27;s home farm.

Upon entry into the school in year 7, boarders are assigned to dormitories; upon moving to Beaumaris Court boys are assigned to double or, in some cases, single rooms, when these are available.

=== Combined Cadet Force ===
The Haberdashers&#x27; Adams CCF is available to year 8 students and above, as a result of which the school sends many officer candidate students to Sandhurst and Royal Air Force College Cranwell. The CCF also plays a role in Newport civic life, parading every year on Remembrance Sunday. The CCF recruits each new school year in September or October from year 8 and, demand permitting, the Lower Sixth. Cadets generally pass out in May or June of the same year.

The CCF has its own building where its stores are housed and NCO meetings take place. The CCF occasionally holds Overnight Exercises where battle drills and fieldcraft are practised; these are held either at Longford Hall, Nesscliffe Training Area, ROF Swynnerton or Leak Military Base. In previous years CCF prepared for the Annual House CCF Competition, known as &quot;The Thompstone Trophy&quot;, named after the eccentric former leader of the CCF Lt-Col Brian Thompstone; this entailed a Drill Competition, Shooting, Command Tasks, Memory Games, Forces-related Quizzes, Section Attacks, CQB and an OBS course. This has not ran in recent years though. The CCF is inspected every two years (the Biennial Inspection) by a senior Army or RAF officer.

Both the Army and RAF sections of the CCF hold Summer Camps every year, visiting working military bases such as RAF Cranwell and Barry Buddon Training Area. Cadets can also attend Adventure Training Camps held annually at Llanbedr and Windermere, Easter Camps at RAF Akrotiri, Summer Camps at Ramstein Air Base and Leadership Courses at RAF Cranwell, Nesscliffe Training Area or at Frimley Park. Additionally, cadets also have the opportunity of attending special events such as the 65th D-Day Landing Commemorations and the Cadet 150 Celebrations.

The CCF has recently undergone many changes and improvements such as the incorporation of a new front team position of responsibility within the school of the Senior Cadet in 2023.

===Sport===

Haberdashers&#x27; Adams has traditionally been a rugby school, and as such requires all boys play rugby through years seven and eight during the autumn and spring terms. Upon entry into year nine, pupils are presented with the option of continuing to play rugby, or switching to field hockey. Cricket and athletics are the main sports disciplines undertaken during the shorter summer term. In year 11 and the sixth form, boys are presented with a wider range of sporting options. With a few exceptions, all sporting events and training takes place at the school&#x27;s Longford Hall playing fields. Haberdashers&#x27; Adams operates a system of games afternoons, by which each individual year group is assigned a specific day of the week to attend afternoon physical activity sessions at Longford.

== Old Novaportans ==
The School supports the &quot;Old Novaportans&#x27; Club&quot; which organises reunions, dinners and sporting events throughout the year to which its members are invited.
Former pupils are known as &quot;Old Novaportans&quot; (initialised as &quot;ON&quot;).

<text>Hughes Hall is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in England. It is the oldest of the University of Cambridge&#x27;s postgraduate colleges. The college also admits undergraduates, though undergraduates admitted by the college must be aged 21 or over. There is no age requirement for postgraduate students. The majority of Hughes Hall students are postgraduate, although nearly one-fifth of the student population comprises individuals aged 21 and above who are studying undergraduate degree courses at the university.

Hughes Hall was founded in the 19th century as the Cambridge Training College for Women with the purpose of providing a college of the university dedicated to training women graduates for the teaching profession. Since then it has enlarged and expanded to support a community of students and researchers, both male and female, working in all the academic domains encompassed by the University of Cambridge.

The college is housed in a number of 19th- and 20th-century buildings at a main site adjacent to Fenner&#x27;s, the Cambridge University Cricket Club ground, and between the City Centre and the railway station.

==History==
In 1878 the University of Cambridge established a Teachers&#x27; Training Syndicate to develop a training curriculum in education for students of the university intending to become teachers. Hughes Hall was established in 1885 as a college for women graduate students taking the Teacher Training curriculum. Key amongst its early supporters and founders were Rev. G. F. Browne, fellow of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Miss Frances Buss, headmistress of the North London Collegiate School, Miss Anne Clough, first principal of Newnham College, and Professor James Ward, fellow of Trinity College.

The college was founded as the Cambridge Training College for Women, and it began with 14 students in a small house in Newnham called Crofton Cottage. The first principal was a graduate of Newnham College, Elizabeth Phillips Hughes (1851-1925), who was in post from 1885 to 1899. In 1895, the college moved to a purpose-built building, designed by architect William Fawcett, overlooking Fenner&#x27;s cricket ground - which continues to be the main college building to this day. One of the first matriculants, Molly Thomas, recounted the experience of the first class of students in &quot;A London Girl of the 1880s&quot;, published under her married name, M.V. Hughes.

Following recognition of full membership of the university for women in 1947, the college became a recognized institution of the university in 1949 and was renamed Hughes Hall in honour of its first principal. The college became an approved foundation of the university in 1985, and received a royal charter marking its full college status in 2006.

The college&#x27;s first male students arrived in 1973, making Hughes Hall the first of the all-female colleges to admit men, and from that time students began to study a wider range of affiliated post-graduate degrees. Student numbers gradually increased in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, Hughes Hall has about 700 graduate students and around 200 undergraduates, all students are &quot;mature&quot; (aged over 21), and the college accommodates study in the wide range of studies taught in the university. The college is one of the most international Cambridge colleges, with its students representing over 60 nationalities.

In November 2019, Prince Andrew resigned as the honorary fellow of Hughes Hall amid the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.

==College site==

===Buildings===
The college&#x27;s main building, known as the Wileman Building, was designed by architect William Fawcett and built in 1895. It was opened by Liberal politician George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon. The building is Grade II listed, red brick in Neo-Dutch style, and has a notable terracotta porch. One wing of the Wileman Building is named the Pfeiffer Wing, after husband and wife Jurgen Edward Pfeiffer and Emily Jane Pfeiffer who funded much of the construction cost as part of their mission to support and develop women&#x27;s education. The building, and its more modern wings, contains student rooms, the college library, social areas and study spaces, and various college administrative offices. Next door to the Wileman Building is Wollaston Lodge, a symmetrical early-20th-century building in buff brick, designed by Edward Schroeder Prior, that provides further student accommodation.

More recent buildings on the college site, all of which provide accommodation and other facilities for students, include Chancellor’s Court, inaugurated in 1992 by the then Chancellor of the University, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Centenary Building, which opened in 1997. In 2005 Hughes opened a new residential, dining, and meeting building, the Fenner&#x27;s Building, which is beside and overlooks the university cricket ground, also named Fenner&#x27;s. It is possible to see the spire of the Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church—the tallest church spire in Cambridge—from the building&#x27;s west-facing windows and terraces. The college also owns a number of houses in the nearby area which provide additional student accommodation.

In 2014 the college acquired the former Cambridge University gym building on Gresham Road, which is across the cricket ground from the main college site, to develop as a new facility—construction began on the site in 2015.

===Location===
The main college site is near the middle of Cambridge, halfway between Cambridge railway station and the Market Square. The college is located in the Petersfield area of the city, close to Mill Road and accessible from Mortimer Road. The main site is in a mainly residential area, and it is beside the Fenner&#x27;s cricket ground, and across the road from Parkside Pools and Kelsey Kerridge Gym, which are the main public sports facilities in the city. A short walk from the college is the Mill Road Cemetery where a number of the university&#x27;s renowned historic figures, including astronomer James Challis, Isaac Newton&#x27;s editor Percival Frost, and historian John Seeley are buried.

====Transport links====
Hughes Hall is the nearest of the university&#x27;s colleges to Cambridge railway station and to the main city centre arrival-departure point for long-distances coaches at Parkside. The most direct access route from the college into the centre of Cambridge for cyclists and pedestrians is across Parker&#x27;s Piece, an open park where the rules of football were first codified (1848).

==Student life==

Students and fellows of the college take part in research and study across the full spectrum of the University of Cambridge&#x27;s fields of activity. Hughes Hall is known for its international and egalitarian ethos, the college does not have a high table. Students can walk on college lawns.

The college&#x27;s historic establishment in the 19th century with the purpose of supporting graduate study in education has continued and developed over time with a significant number of students each year taking courses in professional and applied fields, alongside those studying and carrying out research in more traditional Arts and Humanities subjects. With a mainly postgraduate student body, undergraduates share facilities and an intellectual culture with PhD researchers and MPhil students.

===Societies and sports===
Hughes Hall has an active student sports calendar with college teams in Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Rowing, Rugby, Squash, Table Tennis, and others. Members of the college are also active in sports and teams at university and national level.

There are a number of college societies, including a Chess Club, Film Society, Writing Group, and Law Society amongst others. The college&#x27;s &quot;Hat Club&quot; organises events where students and fellows present papers on their research and study to an audience of college members, and the Enterprise Society supports and encourages students with an interest in starting their own business.

====Music====
The college&#x27;s main performance space is the Pavilion Room which hosts a number of regular musical groups and organizations. The Stradivari Trust, the Cambridge Graduate Orchestra, and the college&#x27;s Margaret Wileman Society use the space on a regular basis. There is also a programme of ad hoc student recitals and concerts, including by the college choir which incorporates students and fellows of the college.

====Boat Club====

Hughes Hall Boat Club is the rowing club of the college, in 2003 there was an official merger with the boat club of Lucy Cavendish College (then a graduate women-only college of the university) creating the &quot;Hughes Hall/Lucy Cavendish Combined Boat Club&quot;.

The Club has been successful in the May Bumps with the men&#x27;s first crew winning blades (a distinction accorded to a boat bumping each day of the bumps) in 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2014. Uniquely, the Club has been recipient of the Pegasus Cup, awarded to the most successful college boat club competing in the May Bumps each year, three times (2007, 2009, 2014). The women&#x27;s first crew won blades for the first time after the demerger from Lucy Cavendish in the Lent Bumps 2019.

Members of Hughes Hall have regularly been selected for the Cambridge team in the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race. In 2015, the men&#x27;s team included three members of Hughes Hall (Jasper Holst, Ben Ruble, Henry Hoffstot), and the women&#x27;s boat was coxed by a member of the college (Rosemary Ostfeld). Henry Hoffstot also appeared for Cambridge in the Race in 2014. In 2019, two members of the Cambridge Blue Crew were present in the men&#x27;s first crew for May Bumps, including Cambridge University Boat Club President Dara Alizadeh. Also present in the boat was Cambridge University Boat Club rower Grant Bitler and Spare-Pair rower Harry Baxter.

The Boat Club houses its six rowing shells in the Emmanuel College boathouse.

===May Ball===
Hughes Hall holds a May Ball each year, often with a global or international theme.

<text>Harry St John Bridger Philby, CIE (3 April 1885 – 30 September 1960), also known as Jack Philby or Sheikh Abdullah (), was a British Arabist, advisor, explorer, writer, and a colonial intelligence officer who served as an advisor to King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia.

As he states in his autobiography, he &quot;became something of a fanatic&quot; and in 1908 &quot;the first Socialist to join the Indian Civil Service&quot;. After studying Oriental languages at the University of Cambridge, he was posted to Lahore in the Punjab in 1908, acquiring fluency in Urdu, Punjabi, Baluchi, Persian and eventually Arabic. He converted to Islam in 1930 and later became an adviser to Ibn Saud, urging him to unite the Arabian Peninsula under Saudi rule, and helping him to negotiate with the United Kingdom and the United States when petroleum was discovered in 1938. His second marriage was to a Saudi Arabian woman, Rozy al-Abdul Aziz.

His only son by his first wife, Dora Johnston, was Kim Philby, who became known worldwide as a double agent for the Soviet Union who defected in 1963. Khaled Philby, one of his three sons with his second wife, is the former United Nations Resident Coordinator (equivalent to an ambassador) in, among others, Kuwait and Turkmenistan.

==Early life==
Born in Badulla in British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the son of a tea planter, he was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied oriental languages under Edward Granville Browne, and was a friend and classmate of Jawaharlal Nehru, who later became the first prime minister of independent India. Philby married Dora Johnston in September 1910, with his distant cousin Bernard Law Montgomery as best man. In addition to their son, Kim, born in 1912, they had three daughters: Diana, Helena and Patricia. The British historian Robert Lacey wrote that Philby was &quot;conceited, irascible, and thoroughly perverse&quot;. Arnold Wilson wrote that Philby was &quot;one of those men who are apt to assume that everything they come across from a government to be a fountain-pen is constructed on wrong principles and is capable of amendment&quot;, leading Philby to reply that he &quot;had never yet the good fortune to encounter either a perfect government or a perfect fountain-pen&quot;.

==Arabist==
In late 1915, Percy Cox recruited Philby as head of the finance branch of the British administration in Baghdad. The position included fixing compensation for property and business owners. The mission was to organise the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Turks and to protect the oil fields in Abadan and the Shatt al Arab, which were a source of fuel for the Royal Navy. The revolt was organised with the promise of creating a unified Arab state, or Arab federation, from Aleppo, Syria, to Aden, Yemen. Gertrude Bell was his first controller and taught him the finer arts of espionage. In 1916 he became Revenue Commissioner for the British Occupied Territories.

In November 1917, Philby was sent to the interior of the Arabian Peninsula as head of a mission to Ibn Saud, the chieftain who professed Wahhabism, the movement within Sunni Islam, and a bitter enemy of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, who led the Hashemites and the Arab Revolt, who were both contenders for &quot;King of the Arabs&quot;. Cox had wanted Ibn Saud to attack the Kingdom of Hali, which had supported the Ottoman Empire. The British mission of four officers which arrived in Riyadh, the capital of the Nejd, doubled in one month the total number of Westerners known to have visited Riyadh in all of its recorded history. The Nejd region in central Arabia was so little known in the West at the time that the precise location of Riyadh was a mystery to Western cartographers who did not know the latitude and longitude of Riyadh. Lacey wrote that in Western maps in the early 20th century &quot;Riyadh was a dot placed capriciously somewhere in the central wilderness&quot;. On 30 November 1917, Philby arrived in Riyadh after riding across the Arabian desert on a camel. Upon entering the royal palace, he was taken to see a &quot;little old man somewhat inclined to stoutness, sharp-featured and bright-eyed&quot; who was generous in supplying coffee and then retired. At that point, Philby realised &quot;another person had been in the room all the room...a very giant of a man&quot; who introduced himself as Abdul Aziz al-Saud, the Emir of the Nejd, also known as Ibn Saud, who had waiting respectfully for his father to leave the room before speaking.

Philby greatly liked and admired Ibn Saud, whom he presented as a romantic hero. Philby&#x27;s attitude to Ibn Saud bordered on hero worship. Reflecting his disenchantment with modern Britain, Philby saw Abdul Aziz as a sort of noble savage, a man unaffected by modern civilisation who because he was &quot;primitive&quot; was a better and nobler man than more &quot;civilised&quot; people. Philby secretly began to favour Ibn Saud even though British policy supported Sherif Hussein. Philby completed a crossing from Riyadh to Jeddah by a &quot;backdoor&quot; route to demonstrate that Saud, not Hussein, was in control of the Arabian highlands. Philby who prided himself on his ability to travel over Arabia-at the time a region that few Westerners had ever visited-kept his distance away from the &quot;Ikhwan&quot; (Arabic for &quot;the brotherhood&quot;), a ferociously fanatical Wahhabi movement notorious for their practice of shooting anyone who refused their offers to convert to Wahhabism. In 1918, Philby went within 3 miles of the &quot;Ikhwan&quot; base at Artawiya, and watched the &quot;Ikhwan&quot; via his binoculars. For his safety, Philby chose not to go any closer to Artawiya. Philby who was fluent in Arabic liked to tease Ibn Saud by telling him it was possible to reach America by either travelling east or west as the earth was round, which led Ibn Saud to say that was not possible as he believed the earth was flat. When Ibn Saud asked what language people in America spoke, Philby told him English, which confused Ibn Saud to no end as he heard that the people in America were Indians and he thought they spoke Hindi, leading Philby to explain to him that there was a difference between the indigenous peoples of the Americas vs. the peoples of the Indian subcontinent. Philby was allowed to meet the future kings of Saudi Arabia who were boys at the time, namely Saud, Faisal, and Fahad.

In November 1918, Britain and France issued the Anglo-French Declaration to the Arabs, which promised self-determination. Philby felt there was a betrayal of that assurance, along with others made in the Balfour Declaration and the Sykes-Picot Agreement, of the promise of a single unified Arab nation. Philby argued that Ibn Saud was a &quot;democrat&quot; guiding his affairs &quot;by mutual counsel&quot;, as laid out in the Quran, in contrast to George Curzon&#x27;s support for Hussein. Tensions between the Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca who ruled the Hejaz vs. Ibn Saud the Emir of the Nejd increased after the war as both men sought to rule Arabia. In October 1919, Ibn Saud sent his Foreign Minister, his 14-year-old son, Crown Prince Faisal, to London to seek British mediation of his dispute with the Sharif of Mecca. None of the major London hotels would allow Faisal and the Nejdi delegation to stay as Faisal&#x27;s slaves had a discontenting habit of starting fires anywhere they wanted to brew coffee for Crown Prince Faisal. Philby who served as the host for Faisal was forced to have the Nejdi delegation stay at a hostel for Indian Army orderly officers at St. George&#x27;s Road as it was the only establishment that was willing to accept Faisal and his party. The sight of Faisal and his party dressed in traditional Arabian robes staying at a cheap hostel attracted the attention of the British newspapers and on 30 October 1919 King George V received Crown Prince Faisal at Buckingham Palace to make up for the slight. After the 1920 Iraqi revolt against the British, Philby was appointed Minister of Internal Security in Mandatory Iraq.

In November 1921, Philby was named chief head of the Secret Service in Mandatory Palestine, worked with T. E. Lawrence and met his American counterpart, Allen Dulles. In late 1922, Philby travelled to London for extensive meetings with parties involved in the Palestine question, included Winston Churchill, George V, Edward, Prince of Wales, Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, Wickham Steed and Chaim Weizmann.

==Adviser to Ibn Saud==
Philby&#x27;s view was that the interests of both the British and the Saud family would be best served by uniting the Arabian Peninsula under one government stretching from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf, with the Saudis supplanting the Hashemites as Islamic &quot;Keepers of the Holy Places&quot; and protecting shipping lanes along the Suez Canal–Aden–Mumbai (then Bombay) route.

Philby was forced to resign his post in 1924 over differences about allowing Jewish immigration to Palestine. He was found to have had unauthorised correspondence with Ibn Saud and to have sent confidential information, which carried with it the connotation of espionage. Shortly afterward, Ibn Saud began to call for the overthrow of the Hashemite dynasty, with Philby advising him on how far he could go in occupying the Hejaz without incurring the wrath of the British, the principal power in the Middle East. The principle reason why Ibn Saud chose not to invade the Hejaz was the £60,000 annual subsidy in gold coins paid to him by the British government and in 1923 Britain ceased paying the subsidy, which inspired Ibn Saud to invade the Hejaz. At the same time, Britain also ceased paying the £25,000 subsidy in gold coins per month to the Hussein, the Sharif of Mecca. Without British gold, the authority of the Sharif of Mecca promptly collapsed as he was not able to bribe the Bedouin tribal chiefs to fight for him. In March 1924, Hussein bin Ali visited his son Abdullah, the Emir of Transjordan, and Philby noticed the Sharif refused to use an automobile as he instead rode a mule from Aqaba to Ma&#x27;an to meet the Emir Abdullah. Philby wrote about the 71 year old Sharif riding a mule across the desert: &quot;He never seemed to wilt and whenever I saw him on the way he was riding upright, stiff as a ramrod&quot;. The Sharif of Mecca was a very unpopular ruler owing to his rapacious corruption and cruelty and it was only the monthly subsidy of British gold that kept the Bedouin tribal chiefs loyal to him. On 5 March 1924 upon hearing the abolition of the caliphate in Turkey, Hussein bin Ali proclaimed himself the new caliph and declared that henceforward all Muslims now owed him their loyalty. The decision of Hussein to proclaim himself caliph sparked outrage all over the Muslim world with the general feeling being that the Sharif had no right to call himself caliph. In August 1924, Ibn Saud declared &quot;jihad&quot; on Hussein for his sacrilegious act in proclaiming himself caliph. The Nejdi invasion of the Hejaz went very well as the &quot;Ikhwan&quot; fighting for Ibn Saud crushed the army of the Sharif who proved quite unwilling to fight for him without British gold. On 16 October 1924, the defeated Sharif of Mecca abdicated as King of the Hejaz and fled the Hejaz, never to return. All the Hashemites held at the end of October 1924 were the cities of Medina and Jeddah. On 17 December 1925, the war ended with Jeddah, the last stronghold of the Hashemites surrendering to Ibn Saud. In 1925, Philby claimed that Ibn Saud had brought unprecedented order into Arabia. The new kingdom of the Hejaz and the Nejd was later renamed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

Philby settled in Jeddah and became a partner in a trading company. Over the next few years, he became famous as an international writer and explorer. Philby personally mapped on camel back what is now the Saudi–Yemeni border on the Rub&#x27; al Khali. In his unique position, he became Ibn Saud&#x27;s chief adviser in dealing with the British Empire and the other Western powers. He converted to Islam in 1930. Upon his conversion to Islam in August 1930, he was given the new name of Abdullah, which is Arabic for &quot;Slave of Allah&quot;. The merchants of Jeddah joked that Philby&#x27;s Muslim name should have been Abdulqirsh, which is Arabic for &quot;Slave of Sixpence&quot; on the account of his greed. Philby was an atheist and his reasons for converting to Islam were cultural, not spiritual, namely that he wanted to become part of the social life of the court of Ibn Saud, which he could not do as an infidel. In 1931, Ibn Saud gave Philby the gift of a slave girl, Mariam, who served as his sex slave. Lacey wrote that after becoming a Muslim Philby &quot;became a fully fledged member of that circle of boon companions, half Privy Council, half gang of chums, who went everywhere with Abdul Aziz [Ibn Saud], chatting, laughing and arguing, discussing politics one minute, playing practical jokes the next&quot;.

In 1931, Philby invited Charles Richard Crane to Jeddah to facilitate exploration of the kingdom&#x27;s subsoil oil. Crane was accompanied by noted historian George Antonius, who acted as translator. Lacey wrote that Philby greatly embellished his role in the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia, writing: &quot;If you read his own accounts-and there are several-Philby was in there from the very beginning. It was he who, in the autumn of 1930, started off the whole story of Saudi oil by telling Abdul Aziz [Ibn Saud] in his car at Taif that he was &#x27;like a man sleeping on top of buried treasure&#x27;; it was he who told the king about Charles Crane; it was he who arranged for Crane to come down from Jeddah from Egypt-and later Philby even published his displeasure that &#x27;Mr. Crane never so much as sent a postcard of thanks for the part I had played&#x27;&quot;. In May 1932, Philby was in London to give a speech about his crossing of the &quot;Rub&#x27; al Khali&quot;, the &quot;Empty Quarter&quot; of Arabia, when he was contacted by Albert Halstead of the American embassy in London who wanted to introduce Philiby to Francis Loomis of the Standard Oil of California (SoCal). Contrary to what Philby later claimed, he assumed that Loomis wanted to meet him to hear about his crossing of the &quot;Rub&#x27; al Khali&quot;, and he was surprised when he learned Loomis was instead interested in oil. Because oil had been discovered in Iran in 1908, it was assumed that the same geological deposit of oil that had been found on the northern end of the Persian Gulf might also extend to the southern end of the Persian Gulf. Besides for being fluent in Arabic, Philby had the advantage of being allowed to enter the Muslim holy city of Mecca (where Ibn Saud often stayed), which all non-Muslims were banned from entering while the oil company executives stayed in Jeddah. The principle revenue in Saudi Arabia prior to the discovery of oil was taxing the pilgrims making the &quot;hajj&quot; to Mecca, and the Great Depression had drastically lowered the number of Muslims making the &quot;hajj&quot; to Mecca, causing a crisis in Saudi Arabia. In early 1932, Ibn Saud had told a British diplomat: &quot;I swear by Allah as a Muslim that I have no money for my children, for my family, and I know not if they will have money for food and clothing&quot;. At the same time, Ibn Saud had complained that the royal cars never seemed to have any petrol, leading him to dispatch Philby to investigate. Philby soon found out that the royal chauffeurs had not been paid for the last five months and were stealing the petrol to support their families.

In May 1932, SoCal sought out Philby in its quest to obtain an oil concession in Saudi Arabia, ultimately signing Philby as a paid adviser to SoCal. On 11 July 1932, Philby told Loomis that Ibn Saud wanted cash in the form of gold sovereigns in exchange for an oil concession and was not interested in the fine print of any agreement. Philby, in turn, recognised that competition by foreign interests would get a better deal for the Saudi king, made contact with George Martin Lees, the chief geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to alert him to SoCal&#x27;s interest in gaining oil exploration rights in Saudi Arabia. Anglo-Persian was one of five international partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) through which it pursued its interest in the Saudi concession. Philby told Ibn Saud that the best deal he could get would be £100, 000 British gold sovereigns, considering that no oil had actually been found in Saudi Arabia yet. Lloyd Hamilton, the lawyer who represented SoCal during the talks in Jeddah in 1932-1933 paid Philby a secret $1, 000 month &quot;retainer&quot; to advance SoCal&#x27;s right to the oil concessions. In March 1933, IPC sent a representative, Stephen Longrigg, to join negotiations with the Saudi government in Jeddah. However, Philby&#x27;s primary loyalty was to the Saudi king. Although he was being paid by SoCal, he kept the arrangement a secret from Longrigg.

The IPC were only half-hearted in seeking oil concessions in Saudi Arabia as their geologists were not entirely convinced there was oil in Saudi Arabia and the Great Depression had caused the price of oil to hit all-time lows. The primary interest for the IPC was keeping the American oil companies out of the Middle East, which was rapidly became clear as SoCal offered much higher bids for the right to a Saudi oil concession than the IPC. Philby&#x27;s main role in the talks was to spark a bidding war that ensured that SoCal paid more for a Saudi oil concession than otherwise would have been the case. During the talks in 1932–1933, Philby sought to increase tensions by telling the rival oil executives in Jeddah cryptic statements that gave the impression that the other side was willing to pay more for a Saudi oil concession. In May 1933, IPC instructed Longrigg to withdraw from Jeddah and to leave SoCal free to conclude negotiations with Saudi Arabia for a 60-year contract to obtain the exclusive concession for exploration and extraction of oil in the al-Hasa region along the Persian Gulf. Ibn Saud did not believe that his kingdom actually had any oil and was more interested in an upfront payment in gold than any long-time rights for revenue from an oil concession. In 1933, the United States did not even maintain diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia and Ibn Saud had preferred to award an oil concession to a British company as Britain was the hegemonic power in the Middle East. Despite what Philby later claimed, the decisive moment in the talks came when Sir Andrew Ryan, the British plenipotentiary-minister to Saudi Arabia told Ibn Saud to accept SoCal&#x27;s offer as it was &quot;money for nothing&quot; as Ryan doubted that Saudi Arabia even had oil. The IPC was willing to offer £10, 000 gold sovereigns for an oil concession while SoCal was willing to offer Ibn Saud £50, 000 gold sovereigns for an oil concession. On 9 May 1933, Ibn Saud signed a contract with SoCal giving them the exclusive rights to an oil concession in exchange for an upfront payment of £35, 000 gold sovereigns, another £20, 000 gold sovereigns after 18 months, and £5, 000 gold sovereigns in rental fees, which would increase to £50, 000 gold sovereigns in monthly rent if any oil was discovered.

By 1934, in an effort to safeguard the port of Aden, Britain had no fewer than 1,400 &quot;peace treaties&quot; with the various tribal rulers of the hinterlands of what became Yemen. Philby undermined British influence in the region, however, by facilitating the entry of American commercial interests, followed by a political alliance between the US and the Saud dynasty.

In 1936, SoCal and Texaco pooled their assets together into what later became ARAMCO (Arabian–American Oil Company). The United States Department of State described ARAMCO as the richest commercial prize in the history of the planet. Philby represented Saudi interests. In 1937 when the Spanish Civil War broke out, Philby arranged for his son, Kim Philby, to become a war correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;. On 16 March 1938 the oil prospectors for SoCal at Well Number 7 in Dhahran discovered the world&#x27;s richest vein of oil, which marked the beginning of the Saudi oil industry. In May 1939, the first shipment of oil from Saudi Arabia to go abroad left on an oil tanker, the &quot;D.G. Schofield&quot;, which set sail for America.

==Philby Plan==
Philby, then known as an anti-Zionist, outlined a plan to reach a compromise with Zionism, after consultation with Arab leaders, and it was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in October 1929. The Philby Plan foresaw a shared confirmation of the Balfour Declaration in the minimal sense of Palestine as the &quot;Jewish national home&quot; without being opposed to the maximal interpretation of the Balfour declaration as a call for a Jewish state in Palestine. The plan called for continued Jewish immigration into Palestine in exchange for a renunciation by Zionists of any desire to seek political dominance. Representation of the two groups would be based on respecting the numerical proportions between both groups. Judah Magnes, chancellor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a member of Brit Shalom, reacted to the proposal positively, and suggested alterations in order to secure guarantees for the Jewish minority. The Philby Plan was subsequently modified to allow for some sort of Jewish state in Palestine in order to gain the acceptance of the Zionist leaders. 
As related in his memoirs, David Ben Gurion, who would become Israel&#x27;s first prime minister, met Philby on 18 May 1937 at the Athenaeum Club, London. Ben Gurion attempted to use Philby as an intermediary to reach an agreement between the Zionist Movement and King Ibn Saud. A few days after their meeting, Philby sent to Ben Gurion a draft treaty by which the Zionists would renounce the Balfour Declaration in exchange for being welcomed to the Middle East by an Arab Federation, headed by Ibn Saud. However, several clauses of the draft treaty were unacceptable to Ben Gurion. In particular, Philby had proposed that Palestine would be &quot;open to the immigration of all those seeking to become its citizens, regardless of race and creed&quot; and refused to mention specific Jewish immigration. To Ben Gurion, that would have defeated the whole aim of Zionism. Ben Gurion sent Philby a counterproposal based on what Ben Gurion regarded as the indispensable minimum Zionist aspirations to which Philby never replied.

Philby&#x27;s plans for a confederation headed by Ibn Saud with a Jewish &quot;national Home&#x27; in Palestine never seems to have interested Ibn Saud, but gained support of Winston Churchill along with the Zionist leaders Lewis Namier and Chaim Weizmann. The romantic image of Ibn Saud as the &quot;desert king&quot; who was more of an &quot;authentic&quot; Arab than the corrupt, Westernised monarchs of Egypt, Transjordan and Iraq was the main reason for the support of Churchill, Namier, and Weizmann for the Philby Plan. The image of Ibn Saud as an &quot;authentic Arab&quot; who was &quot;independent&quot; of the West led to the conclusion that any plan endorsed by him would gain the acceptance of all the Arabs. On 12 March 1941, Churchill told Weizmann that the Philby Plan was the best solution to the &quot;Palestine Question&quot; as Churchill found the rival Jewish and Arab claims to the Palestine Mandate deeply vexing and wished to find some compromise to the intractable dispute. Subsequently, several other leading figures such as the South African prime minister General Jan Smuts and the India Secretary Leo Amery accepted the Philby Plan as the best solution to the problems of the Middle East. The British historian Stephen Dockter wrote that the Philby Plan was impractical not least because Philby was not speaking on behalf of Ibn Saud as he claimed to be. Ibn Saud was willing to allow a Jewish presence in Palestine, but would never accept a Jewish state in Palestine, which he regarded as Muslim land in its entirety. Finally, the plan proposed that the Hashemite monarchs of Iraq and Transjordan accept Ibn Saud as their overlord, which was very unlikely given the long-standing feud between the Hashemite and al-Saud families. In 1924, Ibn Saud had deposed Hussein bin Ali al-Hashemite as King of the Hejaz, who was the father of Emir Abdullah of Transjordan and the great-grandfather of King Faisal II of Iraq, which would have presented serious problems for the Philby plan. Finally, the plan assumed that Ibn Saud as the leader of the proposed confederation would be willing to serve British interests, which showed a major misunderstanding of Ibn Saud who wanted to be an independent and to serve no-one. In November 1941, Churchill abandoned the Philby Plan and decided to &quot;get on with the war&quot; with the problems of the Middle East to be resolved after the war. Dockter wrote that Churchill&#x27;s willingness to accept the Philby Plan reflected his Victorian understanding of the Muslim world as a place whose leaders did not have agendas of their own and could be made to serve British interests because what was best for Britain was always in the best interests of everyone, an assumption not necessarily shared by the peoples of the Middle East.

==The Hythe by-election==
Philby later began secret negotiations with Germany and Spain on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s role in the event of a general European war. The discussions allowed neutral Saudi Arabia to sell oil to neutral Spain, which would then be transported to Germany. John Loftus, who worked in the United States Department of Justice Office of Special Investigations Nazi-hunting unit, claimed that Adolf Eichmann, on a mission to the Middle East, met with Philby &quot;during the mid-1930s&quot;. The discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia in 1938 had made Ibn Saud into an important world leader. In January 1939, Saudi Arabia established diplomatic relations with Germany, and in February 1939 a Saudi emissary arrived at Berchtesgarten to see Adolf Hitler in the Berghof high up in the Bavarian Alps to tell him &quot;that it is our foremost aim to see the friendly and intimate relations with the German &quot;Reich&quot; developed to the utmost limits&quot;. Dr. Fritz Grobba visited Riyadh in January-February 1939 to see Ibn Saud who told him he &quot;hated the English&quot; and looked forward to the day when Germany would replace Britain as the world&#x27;s foremost power. Grobba described Philby as a leading pro-German voice at the court of Ibn Saud who pushed for an alliance of the kingdom with the &quot;Reich&quot;. In July 1939, a contract was signed for Germany to deliver 4, 000 rifles plus ammunition to Saudi Arabia.

Philby, previously a member of the Labour Party, fought a by-election held on 20 July 1939 for the parliamentary constituency of Hythe, Kent. He stood for the anti-Semitic British People&#x27;s Party (BPP) which had been founded by Lord Tavistock in April 1939. Despite his later post-war claims to have not shared the ideology of the BPP, Philby was a founding member of the BPP and sat on the National Executive of the BPP alongside Lord Tavistock, John Beckett, Ben Greene, John Scanlon, and Lord Lymington. Other members of the BPP included Robert Gordon-Canning, Anthony Ludovici and Henry Williamson. During the by-election, Philby declared &quot;no cause whatever is worth the spilling of human blood&quot; and the &quot;protection of the small man against big business&quot;. Philby was recruited by Lord Tavistock to run as the BPP candidate for the by-election. Philby in his 1948 memoir &quot;Arabian Days&quot; downplayed his commitment to the BPP as he wrote &quot;...I was approached by Lord Tavistock, John Beckett and Ben Greene of a new and small organisation called the British People&#x27;s Party, with those general outlook I had no sympathy, though I fully and cordially agreed with the anti-war attitude. Eventually I agreed to fight the Hythe by-election&quot;. Reflecting the way that various extreme right movements in Britain often co-operated, Lady Domville, the wife of Admiral Barry Domvile, the leader of The Link, campaigned hard for Philby in the Hythe by-election. Joining her were Lady Grace Pearson along with a number of activists from the British Union of Fascists-who came mostly from London- who descended upon Hythe and the other small towns of Kent in order to campaign for Philby.

The major issue in the by-election was the Danzig crisis with Philby attacking the Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for having &quot;just sat back to see what would happen&quot;. Philby took the Chamberlain government to task for the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland which he felt was pushing Britain towards an unnecessary war with Germany and favored abandoning Poland to its fate rather than risking a war against the &quot;Reich&quot;. Philby and other speakers on his behalf such as Admiral Barry Domvile, Lord Tavistock, John Beckett, Ben Greene, Lady Pearson, Captain Vincent Collier and Dr. Meyrick Booth devoted much of their time to praising Germany and blaming the entire British Jewish community for having supposedly pushed Britain to the brink of war with Germany in the Danzig crisis. One of the pamphlets produced by the BPP in the by-election, &quot;Alien Money Power in Great Britain&quot; attacked the Conservative candidate Rupert Brabner by claiming he worked for a London law firm run by Jews. Philby in a speech in the by-election on 8 July 1939 praised Hitler for having &quot;restored one of the greatest races in the world to the position of one of the foremost nations in the world as it was in present times&quot;. The British historian Martin Pugh wrote that the campaign for Philby was &quot;amateurish&quot; with Beckett at one point reporting false returns on his canvassing and then saying &quot;That&#x27;s done. Let&#x27;s go to the pub!&quot; Philby won 576 votes in the by-election. Philby lost his deposit.

==The Second World War==
Soon afterward, the Second World War began. He is recorded as having referred to Adolf Hitler as &quot;un homme très fin&quot; (&quot;a most sophisticated man&quot;). In August 1940, Philby had decided to visit the United States to give defeatist lectures to isolationist groups opposed to the pro-Allied neutrality of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Philby believed that Germany was invincible and the theme of his speeches during his planned American tour was that it was folly for the United States to support the United Kingdom.

When he travelled to Bombay, he was arrested on 3 August 1940 under Defence Regulation 18B, deported to England and there briefly interned. Shortly after his release from custody, Philby recommended his son, Kim, to Valentine Vivian, MI6 deputy chief, who recruited him into the British secret service. When Harold B. Hoskins of the United States State Department visited Ibn Saud in August 1943, he asked if the king would be willing to have an intermediary meet with Chaim Weizmann. Ibn Saud angrily responded that he was insulted by the suggestion that he could be bribed for £20 million to accept resettlement of Arabs from Palestine. Hoskins reports the king said Weizmann told him the promise of payment would be &quot;guaranteed by President Roosevelt&quot;. A month later Weizmann wrote in a letter to Sumner Welles: &quot;It is conceived on big lines, large enough to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of both Arabs and Jews, and the strategic and economic interests of the United States;... properly managed, Mr. Philby&#x27;s scheme offers an approach which should not be abandoned&quot;.

==Suez Crisis==
After Ibn Saud died in 1953, Philby openly criticised the successor, King Saud, by saying the royal family&#x27;s morals were being picked up &quot;in the gutters of the West&quot;. He was exiled to Lebanon in 1955. There, he wrote: 

In Beirut, he reconciled with Kim, and they lived together for a time. The son was reemployed by MI6 as an outside informer on retainer. Philby helped further his son&#x27;s career by introducing him to his extensive network of contacts in the Middle East, including Lebanese President Camille Chamoun. Both were sympathetic to Gamal Abdel Nasser during the Suez Crisis in August 1956. Between Jack&#x27;s access to ARAMCO and Kim&#x27;s access to British intelligence, there was little they did not know about Operation Musketeer, the French and British plan to capture the Suez Canal. The Soviets exposed the entire plan in the United Nations and threatened Britain and France with &quot;long-range guided missiles equipped with atomic warheads&quot;.

In 1955, Philby returned to live in Riyadh. In 1960, on a visit to Kim in Beirut, he suddenly became ill and was rushed to hospital. &quot;The man whose life had been so eventful and panoramic, so daring and theatrical, now lay unconscious. He awoke only for a moment and murmured to his son, &#x27;I am so bored&#x27;. And then he expired&quot;. He is buried in the Muslim cemetery in the Basta district of Beirut. His tombstone reads, &quot;Greatest of Arabian Explorers&quot;.

==Academic interests==

In collaboration with George Latimer Bates he took an interest in the birds of the Arabian region. In his travels, he collected specimens for Bates and several new species were described from his specimens. These included the Arabian woodpecker (&quot;Desertipicus&quot; (now &quot;Dendrocopos&quot;) &quot;dorae&quot;), a subspecies (no longer valid) of a scops owl (&quot;Otus scops pamelae&quot;) and Philby&#x27;s partridge (&quot;Alectoris philbyi&quot;). His specimens are held in the British Museum. His specimen packages were sometimes used to transport sensitive documents, a skin of a desert fox included survey maps inside it. He contributed to Bates&#x27; uncompleted work on the birds of Arabia. The manuscript was later used by Richard Meinertzhagen who produced &quot;Birds of Arabia&quot; (1954) giving little credit to Bates.

In 1932, while searching for the lost city of Ubar, he was the first Westerner to visit and describe the Wabar craters.

==Awards and legacy==
In August 1917, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire. In 1920, he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society Founder&#x27;s Medal for his two journeys in South Central Arabia.

A subspecies of Middle Eastern lizard, &quot;Uromastyx ornata philbyi&quot;, and a partridge, &quot;Alectoris philbyi&quot;, are named in his honour.

Some authors have summarised Philby as a British traitor and an anti-Semite. They suggest that Philby never forgave the British government for ending his civil service career for sexual misconduct. Once recruited by MI6, according to those authors, Philby used his intelligence assignment to take revenge on the British government. With the extensive contacts he acquired as a British agent, Philby continued to betray British policy and to resist all efforts at creating a Jewish homeland throughout his life. Philby disclosed classified British intelligence to Ibn Saud during wartime, secretly helped secure American oil concessions in Saudi Arabia, double-crossed British competitors, created economic partnerships allied against British interests and for those of Nazi Germany with the help of Allen Dulles (later CIA Director) and worked with Nazi intelligence to sabotage efforts at creating a Jewish homeland.

Philby&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot; contains the only known account of the 1931 Saudi–Yemeni border skirmish.

The American scholar Jacob Goldberg noted that Philby with his varied interests in the archaeology, literature, politics, geography, and zoology of Arabia plus with the accounts of his travels in Arabia has dominated the Arabian scholarship in a manner that no-one has ever managed. However, Goldberg wrote that Philby was not a reliable source on the history of Arabia owing to his hero worship of Ibn Saud, whom Philby regarded was a close to a perfect man as possible. Furthermore, Goldberg noted that Philby had a strong antagonism towards his own country that verged on Anglophobia and in his account of Arabian history it was always the British who were at fault while Ibn Saud was always the wronged party. Goldberg wrote that Philby was the &quot;official apologist&quot; of Saudi Arabia in the West as evidenced by his 1955 polemical pamphlet about the Buraymi dispute &quot;Saudi Arabia Memorial&quot;, which laid out the Saudi claim to the oasis of Buraymi that was also claimed by Britain as the protecting power of the Sultan of Oman. Several passages from &quot;Saudi Arabia Memorial&quot; were incorporated verbatim into his 1955 book &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot;. Finally, Goldberg noted that even sympathetic observers commented that Philby &quot;saw everything in black and white, without finer shades&quot; which let him to reduce the history of Arabia down to a morality play, a constant struggle between his villains such as the duplicitous British vs. heroes such as his noble Saudis.

Goldberg noted that Philby aggressively engaged in historical distortion in his books. As an example, Goldberg noted that when Ibn Saud seized Riyadh in 1902 from Ibn Rasheed, he become a rebel against the Ottoman Empire and the Sublime Porte dispatched several expeditions in 1904 and 1905 when the aim of reasserting control over the Nejd. Faced with 7, 000 troops of the German-armed and German-trained Ottoman Army marching into the Arabian desert in 1904, Ibn Saud appealed to Sir Percy Cox, the British resident in the Persian Gulf to make the Nejd into a British protectorate as a way to gain British support against the Sublime Porte; Cox did not answer Ibn Saud&#x27;s appeals as the British did not care about the Nejd enough to risk a confrontation with the Ottoman over. The British only cared about control of the coastal areas of Arabia around the Persian Gulf and had no interest in the interior of Arabia, which a barely inhabited desert. Ultimately Ibn Saud was able to defeat the Ottomans on his own. In his histories, Philby did not admit that his hero Ibn Saud had tried hard to have the Nejd become a British protectorate, and mispresented Ibn Saud&#x27;s letters to Cox as an appeals for &quot;cordial understanding&quot;. Goldberg wrote that Philby&#x27;s picture of British policy as anti-Saudi was misleading to say the least as the British were interested in curbing Saudi expansion to the Persian Gulf, but were content to let Ibn Saud rule the Nejd whereas the policy of the Sublime Porte was to incorporate the Nejd into the Ottoman Empire. Goldberg wrote in this way Philby gave a dishonest account of British policy in Arabia as he left the reader with the impression that the British were seeking to annex the Nejd. Likewise, Goldberg noted that Ibn Saud failed to gain the support of the British that he chose appeasement of the Sublime Porte as he feared that Ottomans would dispatch even more troops against him. Despite his battles with the Ottoman Army, Ibn Saud wrote several fawning letters in 1905 and 1906 professing his loyalty to the Ottoman Empire as he argued that he taken Riyadh in 1902 from Ibn Rasheed because it had belonged to his family until 1891, but that he was not disloyal to the Sultan-Caliph Abdul Hamid II. In several of his letters, Ibn Saud wrote that he was willing to submit to the Sublime Porte provided that the Ottomans allowed him to rule as the Emir of the Nejd. Goldberg noted that Philby failed to mention any of this in his books and instead portrayed the Ottomans as leaving the Nejd forever in April 1905 when in fact Ibn Saud handed over several forts to the Ottomans that month in exchange for the Sublime Porte allowing him to stay on as Emir. Goldberg noted Philby himself had written that the Ottomans were still in the Nejd in May 1906, 13 months after their supposed retreat in April 1905. Goldberg accused Philby of trying to &quot;rewrite&quot; the foundation of the modern Saudi state in a manner that glorified Ibn Saud as a &quot;freedom-fighter&quot;.
