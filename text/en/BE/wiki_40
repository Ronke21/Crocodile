<text>Stanley Frank Musial (; born Stanislaw Franciszek Musial; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed &quot;Stan the Man&quot;, was an American baseball outfielder and first baseman. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history, Musial spent 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and from 1946 to 1963. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969 in his first year of eligibility.

Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder and made his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played. Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the 1945 season while serving in the Navy. After completing his military service, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball&#x27;s Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963.

Over the course of his career, Musial batted .331 and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630) (1,815 each at home and on the road), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725). His 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott&#x27;s total of 511. A seven-time batting champion, he was named the National League&#x27;s (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and was a member of three World Series championship teams. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records and 29 National League records. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.

In addition to overseeing personal businesses, including a restaurant, both during and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals&#x27; general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then resigning that position. Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

==Early life==
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, as Stanislaw Franciszek Musial, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz Musial (originally Musiał; ) and Mary Lancos. His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent, and his father was a Polish immigrant who always referred to his son by the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced &quot;Stashu&quot;. Young Stan frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer. Musial also learned about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher. When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.

At age 15, Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao. In his Zincs debut, he pitched six innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults. He played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey Jr. His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname &quot;The Donora Greyhound&quot;.

Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate. Musial&#x27;s father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but he reluctantly gave consent after lobbying by his son and his wife. Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally. In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner&#x27;s office until June 1938. This preserved Musial&#x27;s amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School&#x27;s basketball team to a playoff appearance. He then reported to the Cardinals&#x27; Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Musial&#x27;s rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average. Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary (). Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average. Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals&#x27; other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr. His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts. On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian &quot;Lil&quot; Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple&#x27;s first child followed in August. During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss. For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt, Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 () home in Houston in 1958. In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.

Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager Burt Shotton and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year&#x27;s injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as &quot;a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming&quot;. According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, &quot;The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake.&quot; Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1941–1944)===

Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman&#x27;s Park on September 17, 1941. The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average. Despite Musial&#x27;s late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.

Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching. Musial was hitting .315 by late June, as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL). The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win. He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; article.

The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series. Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman&#x27;s Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game. Musial&#x27;s first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series. Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one. Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored. Musial&#x27;s 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training. He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13. He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562). This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average). After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series. Musial had a single in the Cardinals&#x27; Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win. The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser&#x27;s bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99, ) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial&#x27;s regular season salary.

United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial&#x27;s baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces. He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits. The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis&#x27;s other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series. The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with no RBI. He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win. The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.

===Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)===
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to non-combat duty at the United States Naval Training Center Bainbridge. In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base&#x27;s eight-team league. After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946. In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial&#x27;s Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1946–1963)===
====1946–1949====

Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946. He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial&#x27;s absence in 1945. During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League. He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.

It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man. During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words. Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting. Ward said, &quot;Every time Stan came up they chanted, &#x27;Here comes the man!&#x27;&quot; &quot;&#x27;That man,&#x27; you mean&quot;, Broeg said. &quot;No, &quot;the&quot; man&quot;, replied Ward. Broeg mentioned this story in his &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan &quot;The Man&quot;.
In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman. The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers, prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial&#x27;s Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals&#x27; two-games-to-none series victory. Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three, as Musial had six hits and four RBI. He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn&#x27;s Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).

Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April. On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis. He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended. Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.

Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948. After a May 7 &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads. By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: &quot;Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first.&quot; Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game. On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.

Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702). Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby&#x27;s 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards. If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.

Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius &quot;Biggie&quot; Garagnani in January 1949, opening &quot;Stan Musial &amp; Biggie&#x27;s&quot; restaurant. He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season &quot;without trying&quot;. His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman. Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May. He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game. However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.

In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers&#x27; pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. &quot;They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names&quot;, Newcombe said, &quot;because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people.&quot;

====1950–1954====
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL&#x27;s number two choice. He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27. With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions. New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial led the National League with a .355 batting average, 355 total bases, 124 runs and 12 triples. He finished second in NL MVP voting for the third year in a row and was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Major League Player of the Year.

National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players &quot;who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats&quot;. Cobb went on to refer to Musial as &quot;a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime.&quot; In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, &quot;Cobb is baseball&#x27;s greatest. I don&#x27;t want to contradict him, but I can&#x27;t say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio.&quot;

The only major league pitching appearance of Musial&#x27;s career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial&#x27;s first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.

The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team. Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city. The 1953 season marked Musial&#x27;s 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300. Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader. In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader. The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972. Oddly enough, as a young child, Colbert was in attendance as Musial set his record.

====1955–1959====
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati&#x27;s Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base. Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings. Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.

The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott&#x27;s NL record for extra-base hits on August 12. Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager &quot;Trader Frank&quot; Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts. When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade. Instead, Lane dealt Musial&#x27;s close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.

On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season. Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman&#x27;s Park. When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone. He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895. He finished 1957 as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot;.

Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.) He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial&#x27;s career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis. He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field on May 13. The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans. Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.

Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year. Musial, at tall, had maintained a weight of around throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately overweight and in substandard physical condition. He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats. Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19. A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits. As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season. Seeking more revenue for the players&#x27; pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962. Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season) and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game. He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.

During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy&#x27;s campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democratic Party.

On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson&#x27;s next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson&#x27;s throw flew over Taylor&#x27;s head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark&#x27;s throw and only noticed Anderson&#x27;s ball fly over the second baseman&#x27;s head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.

====1960–1963====
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000. He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University&#x27;s director of physical education. In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average. He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision. In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737). Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits and RBI. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.

The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average. He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month. Making his 20th All-Star appearance and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning. Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season&#x27;s end. He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.

Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat. After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25. Musial&#x27;s last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony. Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial&#x27;s uniform number &quot;6&quot; would be retired by the team. During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth. Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end. Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well. Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial&#x27;s last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb&#x27;s record to become baseball&#x27;s all-time hit king.

At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records. Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134). He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951). He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category. Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military. His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. Amazingly, his career hit total was exactly evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road. Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb&#x27;s career hit record of 4,191. Musial recorded 8 five-hit games and 59 four-hit games in his 22-year MLB career. He had two 3-home run games, on May 2, 1954 and July 8, 1962.
As a pinch-hitter, he recorded a .276 batting average (37-for-134) in that role in his career.

He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base. Since Musial&#x27;s retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.

In Musial&#x27;s 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game. Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport&#x27;s history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, &quot;He didn&#x27;t hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn&#x27;t hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being.&quot;

==Post-playing career and family life==

Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season. From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens. Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team&#x27;s general manager, and he oversaw the club&#x27;s World Series championship that year. He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players&#x27; wives could attend games.

Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer, in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie. Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.

Musial was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events. He appeared on the television show &quot;Hee Haw&quot; in 1985, and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.

Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town&#x27;s mayor using some for United Way fundraising. Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.

During his playing years, Musial believed in racial equality and supported Jackie Robinson&#x27;s right to play. After learning about the harmful effect of smoking in the 1950s, he refused to endorse tobacco products.

==Honors and recognition==
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium. The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006. Musial&#x27;s statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: &quot;Here stands baseball&#x27;s perfect warrior. Here stands baseball&#x27;s perfect knight.&quot; In 1968, Musial received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in , when he was named on 93.2% of the ballots. He was ranked tenth on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998. He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.

In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Musial on their &quot;St. Louis Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along with fellow Cardinals Bob Gibson and Albert Pujols, and St. Louis Blues hockey player Brett Hull. That same year, MLB.com writers voted Musial as being the greatest player in Cardinals franchise history:

On June 14, 1973, Musial was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary&#x27;s College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora. In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history. In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time. According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras. He ranks first on Baseball-Reference&#x27;s Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test. Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history. For instance, in his analysis of baseball&#x27;s under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who&#x27;s-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial.&quot;

Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. A &quot;Stan the Man&quot; day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008. In 2010, another one of the Cardinals&#x27; greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols said he didn&#x27;t want to be called &quot;The Man&quot;, even in Spanish (&quot;El Hombre&quot;), because &quot;There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial.&quot; Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service. The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama who called him &quot;an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you&#x27;d want your kids to emulate.&quot;

On October 18, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the field before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8–3, but lost the pennant to the Giants.

==Death==
On January 19, 2013, surrounded by his family, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day as fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt Jr. released the following statement:

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time. In a laudatory obituary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: &quot;There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate.&quot;

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: &quot;Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of &#x27;baseball&#x27;s perfect warrior&#x27; will endure and inspire generations to come.&quot;

St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: &quot;Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again.&quot; He ordered flags at half-staff in the city.

&quot;Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life&quot;, Commissioner Bud Selig said. &quot;He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan&#x27;s life embodies baseball&#x27;s unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime.&quot;

Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York&#x27;s Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville&#x27;s Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial&#x27;s former parish priest, was the homilist. Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him &quot;the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down&quot;, and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial &quot;was a better player than me because he was a better man than me&quot;.

==Legacy==
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him.
In May 2011, the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial, who was a native of the area.
In October 2013, the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.
In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge. In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Musial as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II. The Stan Musial Lifetime Achievement Award was named in his honor.

<text>Rudolph Ackermann (20 April 1764 in Stollberg, Electorate of Saxony – 30 March 1834 in Finchley, London) was an Anglo-German bookseller, inventor, lithographer, publisher and businessman.

== Biography==
He attended the Latin school in Stollberg, but his wish to study at the university was made impossible by lack of financial means, and he therefore became a saddler like his father.
He worked as a saddler and coach-builder in different German cities, moved from Dresden to Basel and Paris, and then, 23 years old, settled in London. He established himself in Long Acre, the centre of coach-making in London and close to the market at Covent Garden. His extraordinary business instinct, as well as his flair for design and talent for self-promotion, won him the £200 contract to design the ceremonial coach for the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare. After this he designed &quot;The Royal Sailor&quot;, an 8-wheel omnibus that ran between Charing Cross, Greenwich and Woolwich.

Ackermann then moved to Little Russell Street where he published &quot;Imitations of Drawings of Fashionable Carriages&quot; (1791) to promote his coach-making. Other publications followed. An able artist in his own right, in 1795 he established a print-shop and drawing-school at 96 Strand. Ackermann set up a lithographic press and began a trade in prints. He later began to manufacture colours and thick carton paper for landscape and miniature painters. Within three years the premises had become too small and he moved to 101 Strand, in his own words &quot;four doors nearer to Somerset House&quot;, the seat of the Royal Academy of Arts.

Between 1797 and 1800 Ackermann rapidly developed his print and book publishing business bringing together wide variety of talented artists and printmakers including Thomas Rowlandson, Isaac Cruikshank, John Bluck, Theodore Lane, Henry Singleton, Maria Cosway, F. J. Manskirchten, J. C. Stadler, J. H. Schultz, Henri Merke, Thomas Sutherland, Nicholas Heidelhoff, Augustus Pugin, and G. M. Woodward in numerous projects to produce both individual prints as well as illustrations for books and magazines, encompassing many different genres including topography, caricature, portraits, transparencies and decorative prints.

In 1809 he applied his press to the illustration of &quot;Repository of Arts, Literature, Fashions&quot;, which appeared monthly until 1829, by when forty volumes had appeared. The &quot;Repository&quot; documented the changing classicising fashions in dress and furniture of the Regency; Thomas Rowlandson and other distinguished artists were regular contributors. William Combe and Rowlandson&#x27;s parody, &quot;Dr Syntax in search of the Picturesque&quot; first appeared in parts in &quot;Ackermann&#x27;s Poetical Magazine&quot; and was then reissued as a bestselling separate book. Ackermann also published Rowlandson&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;The English Dance of Death&quot; (2 volumes 1816). He introduced from Germany the fashion of the once popular Literary Annuals, beginning in 1823 with &quot;Forget-Me-Not&quot;; and he published many illustrated volumes of topography and travel, including &quot;The Microcosm of London&quot; (3 volumes, 1808–1811), &quot;Westminster Abbey&quot; (2 volumes, 1812), &quot;The Rhine&quot; (1820), &quot;The Seine&quot; (1821), and &quot;The World in Miniature&quot; (43 volumes, 1821–1826).

An inventor and innovator, he was important as a carriage designer and patented the Ackermann steering geometry. In 1801 he patented a method for rendering paper and cloth waterproof and erected a factory in Chelsea to make it. He was one of the first to illuminate his own premises with gas. Indeed, the introduction of lighting by gas owed much to him.

During the Napoleonic wars, Ackermann was an energetic supporter of the Allied cause and made significant contributions to British propaganda through his publication of anti-Napoleonic prints and military manuals. He became a naturalised British citizen in March 1809. After the Battle of Leipzig, Ackermann collected nearly a quarter of a million pounds sterling for the German relief effort.

As one of the pioneers of modern publishing methods, Ackermann developed an international distribution network for his publications and came to have significant commercial interests in South America. The business he founded in London flourished throughout the 19th century under the management of his descendants. He was buried at St. Clement Danes in the Strand, London.

<doc id="280172" wikidata="Q648583" url="?curid=280172" title="Cheiracanthium inclusum">
<text>Cheiracanthium inclusum, alternately known as the black-footed yellow sac spider or the American yellow sac spider (in order to distinguish it from its European cousin &quot;C. punctorium&quot;), was formerly classified as a true sac spider (of the family Clubionidae), and then placed in the family Miturgidae, but now belongs to family Cheiracanthiidae. It is a rather small pale yellow species that is indigenous to the Americas. It is often found living in the foliage of forests and gardens but also can inhabit human homes. Despite common beliefs of necrosis, &quot;Cheiracanthium&quot; bites cause only localized swelling. &quot;C. inclusum&quot; is closely related to &quot;Cheiracanthium mildei&quot;, an introduced species native to Europe which is similar in appearance and natural history and can also be found in North American homes.

==Identification==
Like all spiders, &quot;C. inclusum&quot; has two body segments: a cephalothorax (fused head and thorax) and an abdomen. In females, the body measures between 5 and 9 mm and in males, 4 to 8 mm. The leg span however can be up to with the front pair of legs being longer than the other 3 pairs. Males tend to have a narrower body and a larger leg span than females. &quot;C. inclusum&quot; gets its two common names (yellow sac and black-footed spider) from its appearance. It is a pale yellow-beige colour with dark brown markings on its palps, chelicerae (jaws) and on the ends of its tarsi (feet). There is also often an orange-brown stripe running down the top-centre of its abdomen. 
&quot;C. inclusum&quot; has 8 similarly sized eyes, distributed in 2 parallel horizontal rows. However, ocular input is of minor importance, due to the absence of light during the spider&#x27;s nocturnal activities. The spider relies more on its palps, sensory structures just behind the chelicerae, on the prosoma (cephalothorax), to sense its environment.

==Natural history==

===Distribution===
&quot;C. inclusum&quot; are native to the New World (North, Central, and South America; and West Indies). This species has also been introduced to Africa and Réunion. They are most often found in trees and shrubs, but may also find shelter in houses and other human-made structures.

===Life cycle===
Females of &quot;C. inclusum&quot; mate only once, and produce their first egg mass about 14 days after mating. Two sets of eggs are usually produced, but this can range anywhere from 1 to 5. Egg masses generally contain 17 to 85 eggs, although as many as 112 eggs have been reported in a single egg mass. Egg laying generally occurs during the months of June and July; during this period, females lay their eggs in small (2 cm) silk tubes and enclose themselves with the eggs, protecting them from predators. Females stay with the eggs and juvenile spiders for about 17 days – until their first complete molt. Females which produce additional egg masses construct a second egg sac about two weeks after the juvenile spiders disperse. Males tend to become sexually mature earlier (119 days on average) than females (134 days on average), but time to maturity can range from 65 to 273 days, depending on a number of factors, such as temperature, humidity and photoperiod. C. inclusum spiders normally over-winter as adults or sub-adults.

===Behavior===
Being nocturnal, &quot;C. inclusum&quot; feed and mate at night. &quot;C. inclusum&quot; do not make webs to catch prey; instead, they are active predators, feeding on a variety of arthropods such as insects and other spiders. Prey detection may involve detection of mechanical vibrations of the substrate, and vision seems to play an insignificant role. During the day, they retreat in small silk nests similar to those used for reproduction. A new nest, which may be completely closed, open on one side, or open on both sides, is built every day in under 10 minutes.

&quot;C. inclusum&quot; are known to disperse easily between trees and shrubs. They do this by excreting a long silk thread that gets carried by the wind and sticks to a nearby structure, forming a scaffold between two structures. Alternatively, the spider may stay attached to the thread and balloon through the air. These spiders are infamous for their vertical traveling attached to a silk string, which they use in order to both catch airborne prey, and keep out of reach of other predators, such as larger spiders, centipedes or ants.

==Human impact==
&quot;C. inclusum&quot; spiders are venomous and capable of biting humans. A bite begins with moderate pain followed by itching. Symptoms usually resolve within 7–10 days. However, the spider rarely bites (with females biting more often than wandering males), and the venom rarely produces more than local symptoms.

<doc id="280276" wikidata="Q211435" url="?curid=280276" title="Viceroyalty of Peru">
<text>The Viceroyalty of Peru (), officially known as the Kingdom of Peru (), was a Spanish imperial provincial administrative district, created in 1542, that originally contained modern-day Peru and most of the Spanish Empire in South America, governed from the capital of Lima. Along with the Viceroyalty of New Spain, Peru was one of two Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries.

The Spanish did not resist the Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian established by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The treaty was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while Spain controlled Portugal. The creation during the 18th century of the Viceroyalties of New Granada and Río de la Plata (at the expense of Peru&#x27;s territory) reduced the importance of Lima and shifted the lucrative Andean trade to Buenos Aires, while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Eventually, the viceroyalty would dissolve, as with much of the Spanish Empire, when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These movements led to the formation of the modern-day country of Peru, as well as Chile, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of Peru.

== History ==
===Conquest of Peru===
After the Spanish conquest of Peru, Charles V granted the conquistadors with &quot;adelantados&quot;, giving them the right to become governors and justices of the region they conquered. Prior to the establishment of the Viceroyalty of Peru, several major governorates formed from these grants, including the Governorate of New Castile (1529), Governorate of New Toledo (1534), Governorate of New Andalusia (1534), and Province of Tierra Firme (1539).

=== Exploration and settlement (1542–1643) ===


In 1542, the Spanish organized the existing governorates into the Viceroyalty of New Castile, which shortly afterward would be called the Viceroyalty of Peru, in order to properly control and govern Spanish South America.

In 1544, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (King Charles I of Spain) named Blasco Núñez Vela Peru&#x27;s first viceroy. From September 2, 1564, to November 26, 1569, Lope García de Castro, a Spanish colonial administrator who constituted the first Audiencia in Spanish South America, served as the interim viceroy of Peru.

Although established, the viceroyalty was not properly organized until the arrival of Viceroy Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, who made an extensive tour of inspection of the region. Francisco de Toledo, &quot;one of the great administrators of human times,&quot; established the Inquisition in the viceroyalty and promulgated laws that applied to Indians and Spanish alike, breaking the power of the encomenderos and reducing the old system of &quot;mita&quot; (the Incan system of mandatory labor tribute). He improved the defensibility of the viceroyalty with fortifications, bridges, and &quot;la Armada del Mar del Sur&quot; (the Southern Fleet) against pirates. He ended the indigenous Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, executing the Inca Túpac Amaru, and promoted economic development from the commercial monopoly and mineral extraction, mainly from silver mines in Potosí.

The Amazon Basin and some large adjoining regions had been considered Spanish territory since the Treaty of Tordesillas and explorations such as that by Francisco de Orellana, but Portugal fell under Spanish control between 1580 and 1640. During this time, Portuguese territories in Brazil were controlled by the Spanish crown, which did object to the spread of Portuguese settlement into parts of the Amazon Basin that the treaty had awarded to Spain. Still, Luis Jerónimo de Cabrera, 4th Count of Chinchón sent out a third expedition to explore the Amazon River, under Cristóbal de Acuña; this was part of the return leg of the expedition of Pedro Teixeira.

Some Pacific islands and archipelagoes were visited by Spanish ships in the sixteenth century, but they made no effort to trade with or colonize them. These included New Guinea (by Ýñigo Ortiz de Retez in 1545), the Solomon Islands (in 1568), and the Marquesas Islands (in 1595) by Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira.
The first Jesuit reduction to Christianize the indigenous population was founded in 1609, but some areas occupied by Brazilians as bandeirantes gradually extended their activities through much of the basin and adjoining Mato Grosso in the 17th and 18th centuries. These groups had the advantage of remote geography and river access from the mouth of the Amazon, which was in Portuguese territory. Meanwhile, the Spanish were barred by their laws from enslaving indigenous people, leaving them without a commercial interest deep in the interior of the basin.

A famous attack upon a Spanish mission in 1628 resulted in the enslavement of 60,000 indigenous people. In fact, as time passed, they were used as a self-funding occupation force by the Portuguese authorities in what was effectively a low-level war of territorial conquest.

In 1617, viceroy Francisco de Borja y Aragón divided the government of Río de la Plata in two, Buenos Aires and Paraguay, both dependencies of the Viceroyalty of Peru. He established the &quot;Tribunal del Consulado&quot;, a court and administrative body for commercial affairs in the viceroyalty. Diego Fernández de Córdoba, Marquis of Guadalcázar, reformed the fiscal system and stopped the interfamily rivalry that was bloodying the domain.

Other viceroys, such as Fernando Torres, Fernández de Cabrera, and Fernández Córdoba expanded the royal navy and fortified the ports to resist foreign incursions, such as those led by privateer Thomas Cavendish. Fernández de Cabrera also suppressed an insurrection of the Uru and Mapuche Indians.

=== The last Spanish Habsburgs (1643–1713) ===


Viceroys had to protect the Pacific coast from French contraband and English and Dutch pirates and privateers. They expanded the naval forces, fortified the ports of Valdivia, Valparaíso, Arica and Callao and constructed city walls in Lima (1686) and Trujillo (1685–1687). Nevertheless, the famous Welsh privateer Henry Morgan took Chagres and captured and sacked the city of Panama in the early part of 1670. Also Peruvian forces repelled the attacks by Edward David (1684 and 1686), Charles Wager and Thomas Colb (1708). The Peace of Utrecht allowed the British to send ships and merchandise to the fair at Portobello.

In this period, revolts were common. Around 1656, Pedro Bohórquez crowned himself Inca (emperor) of the Calchaquí Indians, inciting the indigenous population to revolt. From 1665 until 1668, the rich mineowners José and Gaspar Salcedo revolted against the colonial government. The clergy were opposed to the nomination of prelates from Spain. Viceroy Diego Ladrón de Guevara had to take measures against an uprising of slaves at the hacienda of Huachipa de Lima. There were terrible earthquakes (1655, 1687) and epidemics, too.

During Baltasar de la Cueva Enríquez&#x27;s administration, the laws of the Indies were compiled. Diego de Benavides y de la Cueva issued the &quot;Ordenanza de Obrajes&quot; (Ordenance of Manufactures) in 1664 and Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Leiva introduced the &quot;papel sellado&quot; (literally, sealed paper). In 1683 Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull reestablished the Lima mint, which had been closed since 1572. Viceroy Diego Ladrón de Guevara increased the production of silver in the mines of Potosí, and stimulated production in other mines at San Nicolás, Cajatambo and Huancavelica. He limited the manufacture of aguardiente from sugar cane to authorized factories, which he taxed heavily.

The Churches of Los Desamparados (1672), La Buena Muerte and the convent of Mínimos de San Francisco de Paula were finished and opened. The Hospital of Espiritu Santo in Lima and San Bartolomé hospital were built.

===The Bourbon Reforms (1713–1806)===
In 1717, the Viceroyalty of New Granada was created from the northern territories, the &quot;Audiencias&quot; of Bogotá, Quito and Panama. This viceroyalty initially lasted only until 1724, but was reestablished permanently in 1740. With the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata from southern areas that are now Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay in 1776, the Charcas and Buenos Aires &quot;audiencias&quot; were similarly lost. The 256-year-old Treaty of Tordesillas was superseded by the 1750 Treaty of Madrid which granted Portugal control of the lands it had occupied in South America in the intervening centuries. This Portuguese occupation led to the Guaraní War of 1756. Amazonas is named after the Amazon River, and was formerly part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru, a region called Spanish Guyana. It was settled by the Portuguese in the early 18th century and incorporated into the Portuguese empire after the Treaty of Madrid in 1750. It became a state of the Brazilian Republic in 1889.

Several viceroys had scientific, political and economic impact on the Viceroyalty. Manuel de Amat y Juniet organized an expedition to Tahiti. Viceroy Teodoro de Croix also decentralized the government through the creation of eight &quot;intendencias&quot; in the area of the &quot;Audiencia&quot; of Lima, and two in the Captaincy General of Chile. Francisco Gil de Taboada reincorporated the region of Puno into the Viceroyalty of Peru. José de Armendáriz stimulated the production of silver and took steps against fraud, corruption and smuggling. Amat y Juniet established the first Regulation of Commerce and Organization of Customs rules, which led to the building of the customshouse in Callao. Teodoro de Croix collaborated in the creation of the &quot;Junta Superior de Comercio&quot; and the &quot;Tribunal de Minería&quot; (1786).

An earthquake demolished Lima and Callao, in 1746. Viceroy Amat y Juniet constructed various public works in Lima, including the first bull ring. Manuel de Guirior also improved the medical care at ten hospitals in Lima and established a foundling home.

War between Spain and Britain again broke out (the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, 1739–1748). Amat y Juniet constructed the fortress of Real Felipe in Callao in 1774.

Nevertheless, throughout this period, rebellions by Native Peruvians were not entirely suppressed. In the eighteenth century alone, there were fourteen large uprisings, the most important of which were that of Juan Santos Atahualpa in 1742, and the Sierra Uprising of Túpac Amaru II in 1780. The Comunero Revolt broke out in Paraguay from 1721 to 1732). In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from the colony.

=== End of the Viceroyalty (1806–1824)===

Viceroy José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa promoted educational reforms, reorganized the army, and stamped out local rebellions. During his administration, the Inquisition of Lima was temporarily abolished as a result of the reforms taken by the Cortes in Spain.

When the wars of independence broke out in 1810, Peru was the center of Royalist reaction. Abascal reincorporated the provinces of Córdoba, Potosí, La Paz, Charcas, Rancagua and Quito into the Viceroyalty of Peru. The Royal Army of Peru during 14 years defeated the patriots armies of Argentinians and Chileans, turning Peru into the last royal bastion in South America.

A large fire in Guayaquil destroyed approximately half of the city in 1812.

Lord Cochrane unsuccessfully attacked Guayaquil and Callao, but on 4 February he captured Valdivia, called at the time &quot;The Key of the South Seas&quot; and the &quot;Gibraltar of the Pacific&quot;, due to its huge fortifications. However, the viceroyalty managed to defend Chiloé Island until 1826.

On September 8, 1820, the &quot;Expedición Libertadora&quot; of Peru, organized mainly by the Chilean government with the objective of executing previous plans laid out by Argentine libertador José de San Martín, landed on the beach at Paracas Bay near the city of Pisco, with the land army under the command of José de San Martín and the navy under the command of Thomas Cochrane. After Cochrane&#x27;s navy defeated the Spanish navy on the Peruvian coasts, the expedition secured the surrender of Callao. After fruitless negotiations with the viceroy, the expedition occupied the Peruvian capital of Lima on July 21, 1821. The independence of Peru was proclaimed on July 28, 1821. Viceroy José de la Serna e Hinojosa, still in command of a sizable military force, retired to Jauja, and later to Cusco.

On July 26, 1822, San Martín and Simón Bolívar met in Guayaquil to define a strategy for the liberation of the rest of Peru. The meeting was secret, and exactly what occurred is not known. However, afterwards San Martín returned to Argentina while Bolívar prepared to launch an offensive against the remaining royalist forces in Peru and Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia). In September 1823 Bolívar arrived in Lima with Antonio José de Sucre to plan the offensive.

In February 1824 the royalists briefly regained control of Lima. Olañeta&#x27;s Rebellion started by surprise and the entire royalist army of Upper Peru (today&#x27;s Bolivia) revolted, led by the royalist commander Pedro Antonio Olañeta against José de la Serna, the liberal viceroy of Peru. This broke the royal army and started a civil war in Upper Peru. Having regrouped in Trujillo, Bolívar in June led his rebel forces South to confront the Spanish under Field Marshal José de Canterac. The two armies met on the plains of Junín on August 6, 1824, and the Peruvians were victorious in a battle fought entirely without firearms. The Spanish troops subsequently evacuated Lima for a second time.

As a result of a decree of the Congress of Gran Colombia, Bolívar turned over command of the rebel troops to Sucre on October 7, 1824.
At this point, royalist control was reduced to Cusco in the south-central highlands. The viceroy launched a counter-offensive over Ayacucho, and on 9 December 1824. The Battle of Ayacucho (also known as the Battle of La Quinua), took place between royalist Spanish and nationalist (republican) troops at Pampa de La Quinua, a few kilometers away from Ayacucho, near the town of Quinua. This battle, led by Bolívar&#x27;s lieutenant Antonio José de Sucre, sealed the independence of Peru and South America. During this battle, the losing Spanish army sustained 2,000 dead and wounded and lost 3,000 prisoners, with the remainder of the army entirely dispersed. During the battle, Viceroy Serna was wounded and taken prisoner, where he signed the final capitulation whereby the Spaniards agreed to leave Peru. Serna was released soon afterwards and sailed for Europe.

Spain made futile attempts to retain its former territories, such as at the Siege of Callao (1826), but after death of King Ferdinand VII of Spain in 1836, the government of Spain renounced its territorial and sovereignty claims over all of continental America. In 1867, Spain signed a peace treaty with Peru and in 1879 it signed a treaty recognizing Peru&#x27;s independence.

== Politics ==
The town of Lima, founded by Pizarro on January 18, 1535, as the &quot;Ciudad de los Reyes&quot; (City of the Kings/Magi), became the seat of the new viceroyalty. As the seat of a viceroy, who had oversight over all of Spanish South America except for Portuguese-dominated Brazil, Lima grew into a powerful city. During the 16th, 17th and most of the 18th centuries, all of the colonial wealth of South America created by the silver mines passed through Lima on its way to the Isthmus of Panama and from there to Seville, Spain. The rest of the viceroyalty dependent upon Lima in administrative matters, in a pattern that persists until today in Peru. By the start of the 18th century, Lima had become a distinguished and aristocratic colonial capital, seat of the 250-year-old Royal and Pontifical University of San Marcos and the chief Spanish stronghold in the Americas.

At ground level during the first century, Spanish &quot;encomenderos&quot; depended on local chieftains (&quot;curacas&quot;) to gain access to the Indian population&#x27;s tribute labor, even the most remote settlements, and therefore, many &quot;encomenderos&quot; developed reciprocal, if still hierarchical, relationships with the &quot;curacas&quot;. By the end of the 16th century the quasi-private &quot;encomienda&quot; had been replaced by the &quot;repartimiento&quot; system (known in Peru by the Quechua term, &quot;mita&quot;), which was controlled by local crown officials.

Politically the viceroyalty was further divided into &quot;audiencias&quot;, which were primarily superior tribunals, but which also had administrative and legislative functions. Each of these was responsible to the Viceroy of Peru in administrative matters (though not in judicial ones). Audiencias further incorporated the older, smaller divisions known as &quot;governorships&quot; (&quot;gobernaciones&quot;, roughly provinces) headed by a governor. &quot;(See, Adelantado.)&quot; Provinces which were under military threat were grouped into captaincies general, such as the Captaincy General of Chile (established in 1541 and established as a Bourbon captaincy general in 1789), and which were joint military and political commands with a certain level of autonomy. (The viceroy was captain-general of the provinces which remained directly under his command).

At the local level there were hundreds of districts, in both Indian and Spanish areas, which were headed by either a &quot;corregidor&quot; (also known as an &quot;alcalde mayor&quot;) or a &quot;cabildo&quot; (town council), both of which had judicial and administrative powers. In the late 18th century the Bourbon dynasty began phasing out the &quot;corregidores&quot; and introduced intendants, whose broad fiscal powers cut into the authority of the viceroys, governors and &quot;cabildos&quot;. (&quot;See Bourbon Reforms.&quot;)

== Economy ==
The economy of the viceroyalty of Peru largely depended on the export of silver. The huge amounts of silver exported from the viceroyalty of Peru and Mexico deeply affected Europe, where some scholars believe it caused the so-called price revolution. Silver mining was carried out using contract and free wage labourers, as well as the mita system of unfree labour, a system inherited from pre-Hispanic times. Silver production peaked in 1610.

Once the Viceroyalty of Peru was established, gold and silver from the Andes enriched the conquerors, and the viceroyalty became the principal source of Spanish wealth and power in South America. The first coins minted for Peru (and indeed for South America) appeared between 1568 and 1570. Viceroy Manuel de Oms y de Santa Pau sent back an enormous sum of money (1,600,000 pesos) to the king to cover some of the costs of the War of the Spanish Succession. This was possible in part because of the discovery of the mines in Caraboya. 

While most of the silver from the viceroyalty ended up in Europe some circulated within South America. Indeed, the Real Situado was an annual payment of silver from the viceroyalty to finance the permanent Spanish army in Chile that which fought a prolonged conflict known as Arauco War. The Spanish in turn traded part of this silver with Mapuches giving origin to a tradition of Mapuche silverwork. Another issue that burdened the finances of the viceroyalty was the maintenance of the Valdivian Fort System built in response to the Dutch expedition to Valdivia in 1643.

Luis Jerónimo Fernández de Cabrera prohibited direct trade between Peru and New Spain (Mexico) and the persecution of Portuguese Jews, the principal traders in Lima.

Beginning in 1633 the Spanish crown allowed for the purchase of high-ranking offices, which led to an increase of power of the local elites and a dimishing efficiency in administration given that local officials were less skilled compared with those from Spain appointed by the crown. This was also a source of increased corruption in the viceroyalty.

== Demographics ==

A census taken by the last Quipucamayoc indicated that there were 12 million inhabitants of Inca Peru; 45 years later, under viceroy Toledo, the census figures amounted to only 1,100,000 Indians. While the attrition was not an organized attempt at genocide, the results were similar, largely resulting from smallpox and other Eurasian diseases to which the natives had no immunity. Inca cities were given Spanish Christian names and rebuilt as Spanish towns, each centered around a plaza with a church or cathedral facing an official residence. A few Inca cities like Cusco retained native masonry for the foundations of their walls. Other Inca sites, like Huanuco Viejo, were abandoned for cities at lower altitudes more hospitable to the Spanish.

Viceroy José de Armendáriz reestablished the system whereby Inca nobles who could prove their ancestry were recognized as hijosdalgos of Castile. This led to a frenzy on the part of the Indigenous nobility to legitimate their status.

In the 1790s, Viceroy Francisco Gil de Taboada ordered the first official census of the population.

The last cargo of black slaves in Peru was landed in 1806. At that time, an adult male slave sold for 600 pesos.

== Culture ==
Viceroy Francisco de Borja y Aragón reorganized the University of San Marcos and Luis Jerónimo Fernández de Cabrera founded two chairs of medicine. In the 1710s, Viceroy Diego Ladrón de Guevara established a chair of anatomy. Teodoro de Croix and Francisco Gil de Taboada founded anatomy centers. In 1810 the medical school of San Fernando was founded.

On the death of the Peruvian astronomer Doctor Francisco Ruiz Lozano, Viceroy Melchor Liñán y Cisneros (with the approval of the Crown) gave mathematics a permanent position in the University of San Marcos. Mathematics was attached to the chair of cosmography. Doctor Juan Ramón Koening, a Belgian by birth, was named to the chair.. Viceroy Manuel de Guirior created two new chairs at the university.

Luis Enríquez de Guzmán, 9th Count of Alba de Liste founded the Naval Academy of the colony. Francisco Gil de Taboada supported the navigation school. Teodoro de Croix began the Botanic Garden of Lima.

Francisco de Borja y Aragón also founded, in Cusco, the &quot;Colegio del Príncipe&quot; for sons of the Indigenous nobility and the &quot;Colegio de San Francisco&quot; for sons of the conquistadors. Manuel de Amat y Juniet founded the Royal College of San Carlos.

The first books printed in Peru were produced by Antonio Ricardo, a printer from Turin who settled in Lima. Diego de Benavides y de la Cueva built the first theater in Lima. Manuel de Oms y de Santa Pau founded a literary academy in 1709 and promoted weekly literary discussions in the palace that attracted some of Lima&#x27;s best writers. These included the famous Criollo scholar Pedro Peralta y Barnuevo and several Indigenous poets. Oms introduced French and Italian fashions in the viceroyalty. The Italian musician Rocco Cerruti (1688–1760) arrived in Peru. Francisco Gil de Taboada supported the foundation of the newspaper &quot;El Mercurio Peruano&quot; in 1791 and founded the Academy of Fine Arts.

Jesuit Barnabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, brought the cinchona bark from Lima to Spain in 1632, and afterwards to Rome and other parts of Italy.

In 1671, Rose of Lima was canonized by Pope Clement X. Rose was the first native-born American to become a Catholic saint. Pope Benedict XIII elevated another two important Peruvian saints, Toribio Alfonso de Mogrovejo and Francisco de Solano.

Diego Quispe Tito was a famous artist before the age of Independence.

==Science==
In 1737, Jorge Juan y Santacilia and Antonio de Ulloa, Spanish scientists sent by the French Academy on a scientific mission to measure a degree of meridian arc at the equator, arrived in the colony. They also had the mission of reporting on disorganization and corruption in the government and smuggling. Their report was published later, under the title &quot;Noticias Secretas de América&quot; (&quot;Secret News From America&quot;).

Manuel de Guirior assisted the scientific expedition of Hipólito Ruiz López, José Antonio Pavón and Joseph Dombey, sent to study the flora of the viceroyalty. The expedition lasted from 1777 to 1788. Their findings were later published as &quot;La flora peruana y chilena&quot; (&quot;The Flora of Peru and Chile&quot;). Again a major concern was stimulating the economy, which Guirior did by adopting liberal measures in agriculture, mining, commerce and industry.

Another French influence on science in the colony was Louis Godin, another member of the meridian expedition. He was appointed &quot;cosmógrafo mayor&quot; by Viceroy Mendoza. The duties of &quot;cosmógrafo mayor&quot; included publishing almanacs and sailing instructions. Another French scientist in Peru at this time was Charles Marie de La Condamine.

The Balmis Expedition arrived in Lima on May 23, 1806. At the same time these viceroys adopted rigorous measures to suppress the thought of the Encyclopedists and revolutionaries in the United States and France.

<doc id="280291" wikidata="Q7735563" url="?curid=280291" title="The G-String Murders">
<text>The G-String Murders is a 1941 detective novel written by American burlesque performer Gypsy Rose Lee. There have been claims made that the novel was written by mystery writer Craig Rice, but others have suggested that there is sufficient documented evidence in the form of manuscripts and correspondence to prove Lee wrote at least a large portion, if not the whole, of the novel under the tutelage of editor/friend George Davis with some essential guidance from her good friend Rice. The novel has been published under the titles &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot; and &quot;The Strip-Tease Murders&quot;. Set in a burlesque theater, Lee casts herself as the detective who solves a set of homicides in which strippers in her troupe are found strangled with their own G-strings. 

In 2005, Feminist Press of the City University of New York republished the book as one of its &quot;Women Write Pulp&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
Gypsy Rose Lee narrates her way through a tale of a double murder, backstage at the &quot;Old Opera&quot; burlesque theatre on 42nd Street, New York City.

The story depicts a world populated by strippers, comics, and costume salesmen, where crime is part of the norm and where women struggle to earn a living.

The narrative is a &quot;wise-cracking&quot; and humorous tale of murder in a burlesque house, and with the unusual weapon of the title. Eventually, Gypsy discovers that an elderly male stagehand, Stachi, is the assailant, given that he was traumatised when he discovered that his grand-daughter, Lolita La Verne, was one of the performers. Fortunately, he is apprehended before he can kill Gypsy in his turn, due to a prearranged police trap in which she offered herself as &#x27;bait.&#x27;

==Characters==
* Gypsy Rose Lee, narrator
* Lolita La Verne, stripper
* Gee Gee Graham, stripper
* Biff Brannigan, comedian
* Siggy, costume salesman

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;Anyone keen about sex in fiction will admire this workmanlike job for its account of a performing group, its use of technicalities—if that&#x27;s the word—about stripping, and its handling of the clues by a likeable lieutenant… This is one of a handful of books about backstage murder that are tolerable. It is not made worse by being told in the first person, or by a bit of sentimental lovey-dovey between the narratrix and one of the cast of characters.&quot;

==Adaptations==

The novel was filmed in 1943 as &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot;, directed by William Wellman, starring Barbara Stanwyck as Dixie Daisy (the Lee character), Michael O&#x27;Shea as her romantic interest, and Pinky Lee. It is a fairly faithful, if bowdlerized, representation, but notable for the addition of music and songs, including &quot;Take It Off the E String, Play It on the G String&quot;, sung by Stanwyck. The film attempts to show what the censors of 1943 would allow with respect to the precise nature of &quot;bumps&quot; and &quot;grinds&quot; as well as the slapdash nature of burlesque shows.

<doc id="280312" wikidata="Q8721" url="?curid=280312" title="Glasgow Airport">
<text>Glasgow Airport, also known as Glasgow International Airport () formerly &quot;Abbotsinch Airport&quot;, is an international airport in Scotland. It is located in Paisley, Renfrewshire, west of Glasgow city centre. In 2019, the airport handled 8.84 million passengers, an 8.4% annual decrease, making it the second-busiest in Scotland, after Edinburgh Airport, and the ninth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom.

The airport is owned and operated by AGS Airports which also owns and operates Aberdeen and Southampton airports. It was previously owned and operated by Heathrow Airport Holdings (formerly known as BAA). Loganair are headquartered at the airport and have a maintenance hangar here. easyJet, Jet2.com and TUI Airways also use Glasgow as a hub.

Glasgow Airport was opened in 1966 and originally flights only operated to other places in the United Kingdom and Europe. Glasgow Airport began to offer flights to other places around the world, flights which previously used Glasgow Prestwick Airport, which was subsequently relegated as the city&#x27;s secondary airport catering for Ryanair and freight operators.

==History==
The history of the present Glasgow Airport goes back to 1932, when the site at Abbotsinch, between the Black Cart Water and the White Cart Water, near Paisley in Renfrewshire, was opened. In 1933 the Royal Air Force 602 Squadron (City of Glasgow) Auxiliary Air Force moved its Westland Wapiti IIA aircraft from nearby Renfrew. The RAF Station HQ, however, was not formed until 1 July 1936 when 6 Auxiliary Group, Bomber Command, arrived. From May 1939, until moving away in October 1939, the Squadron flew the Supermarine Spitfire.

===1940–1960===
In 1940, a torpedo training unit was formed, which trained both RAF and Royal Navy crews under RAF Coastal Command. The Admiralty was granted a lodger facility for a RN Air Section at Royal Air Force Abbotsinch from 19 June 1940. The airbase was transferred from No. 19 Group RAF to the Admiralty on 11 August 1943, known as Royal Naval Air Station Abbotsinch, (or RNAS Abbotsinch). Its primary function was an Aircraft Maintenance Yard and Reserve Aircraft Storage and Salvage. On 20 September it was commissioned HMS &quot;Sanderling&quot;. During the 1950s, the airfield housed a large aircraft storage unit and squadrons of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.

The Royal Navy left in October 1963. The name Sanderling was, however, retained as a link between the two: HMS &quot;Sanderling&quot;″s ship&#x27;s bell was presented to the new airport and a bar in the airport was named &quot;The Sanderling Bar&quot;.

The following squadrons were based at Glasgow Airport at some point:

;Units:
===1960–1970===
In the 1960s, Glasgow Corporation decided that a new airport for the city was required. The original site of Glasgow&#x27;s main airport, Renfrew Airport, was east of the current airport, in what is now the Dean Park area of Renfrew. The original Art Deco terminal building of the original airport has not survived. The site is now occupied by a Tesco supermarket and the M8 motorway; this straight and level section of motorway occupies the site of the runway.

Abbotsinch took over from Renfrew Airport on 2 May 1966. The UK Government had already committed millions into rebuilding Glasgow Prestwick Airport fit for the &quot;jet age&quot;. Nevertheless, the plan went forward and the new airport, designed by Basil Spence and built at a cost of £4.2 million, it was completed in 1966, with British European Airways beginning services using De Havilland Comet aircraft.

The first commercial flight to arrive was a British European Airways flight from Edinburgh, landing at 8 am on 2 May 1966. The airport was officially opened on 27 June 1966 by Queen Elizabeth II. The political rows over Glasgow and Prestwick airports continued, with Prestwick enjoying a monopoly over transatlantic traffic (under the 1946 US-UK Air transport agreement known as the Bermuda Agreement), while Glasgow Airport was only allowed to handle UK and intra-European traffic.

===1970s–1990s===

In 1975, the BAA took ownership of Glasgow Airport. When BAA was privatised in the late 1980s, as BAA plc, it consolidated its airport portfolio and sold Prestwick Airport. BAA embarked on a massive redevelopment plan for Glasgow International Airport in 1989.

In the early 1990s, Glasgow became the first UK airport, and one of the first in Europe (after Israel) to screen all baggage. Until this time, only &#x27;high risk&#x27; flights had their hand luggage and hold luggage checked. This was a result of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on the 21st December 1988 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.

An extended terminal building was created by building a pre-fabricated metal structure around the front of the original Basil Spence building, hence screening much of its distinctive Brutalist style architecture from view, with the void between the two structures joined by a glass atrium and walkway. Spence&#x27;s original concrete facade which once looked onto Caledonia Road now fronts the check-in desks. The original building can be seen more clearly from the rear, with the mock barrel-vaulted roof visible when airside.

A dedicated international departure lounge and pier was added at the western side of the building, leaving the facility with a total of 38 gates, bringing its capacity up to nine million passengers per year. In 2003, BAA completed redevelopment work on a satellite building (called &quot;T2&quot;, formerly the St. Andrews Building), to provide a dedicated check-in facility for low-cost airlines, principally Jet2.com.

By 1996, Glasgow was handling over 5.5 million passengers per annum, making it the fourth-largest airport in the UK.

===Post–2000===

The airport serves a variety of destinations throughout Canada, Europe and the Middle East. The terminal consists of three piers; the West Pier, Central Pier and East Pier. The West Pier, commonly known as the International Pier, was built as part of the 1989 extension project and is the principal international and long haul departure point. All but two of the stands on this pier are equipped with airbridges. This pier has stands 27 - 36. In 2019, the pier received the ability to facilitate the Airbus A380 following an £8million upgrade.

The Central Pier is part of the original 1966 building. The main user of the pier is British Airways, who tend to use the majority of its gates, with London shuttles (to Heathrow, Gatwick and London City) making up almost all of its traffic. The British Airways lounge is located on this pier, across from gate 15. Aer Lingus, Loganair, Jet2.com and TUI Airways also operate from the central pier. Most of the stands on this pier are equipped with airbridges. This pier has stands 14 - 26. The now defunct airlines Flybe and British Midland (bmi) were once major users of the Central Pier.

The East Pier, constructed in the mid-1970s, was originally used for international flights but in recent years has been re-developed for use by low-cost airlines. None of the stands on this pier are equipped with airbridges. The main users of this pier are easyJet and Loganair. In 2015, a £3million extension was added to the pier, creating space for 750,000 extra passengers a year. This pier has stands 112.

In late 2007, work commenced on Skyhub (located between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2) which created a single, purpose-built security screening area in place of the previous individual facilities for each of the three piers, the other side effect being an enlarged duty-free shopping area created by taking most of the previous landside shopping and restaurant facilities airside. This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate duty-free shops in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now airside, making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.

Future growth is hampered by the airport&#x27;s location, which is constrained by the M8 motorway to the south, the town of Renfrew to the east and the River Clyde to the north. At present the areas of Drumchapel, Clydebank, Bearsden, Foxbar, Faifley and Linwood all sit directly underneath the approach paths into the airport, meaning that further increases in traffic may be politically sensitive. The airport is challenged by Edinburgh Airport, which now serves a wider range of European destinations and has grown to overtake Glasgow as Scotland&#x27;s busiest airport. The Scottish Executive announced in 2002 that a rail line – known as the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) – would be built from Glasgow Central station to Glasgow Airport. The rail link was to be completed by 2012 with the first trains running early in 2013. In 2009, however, it was announced by the Scottish Government that the plan had been cancelled.

Currently, the airport is easily accessible by road due with direct access to the adjoining M8 motorway. It is also served by a frequent bus service, the Glasgow Airport Express, which operates services to city centre. The service is run by First Glasgow and all buses feature leather seats, USB charging ports and free WiFi. The airport is home to the Scottish regional airline Loganair, previously a Flybe franchise operator, who have their head office located on site. British Airways has a maintenance hangar at the airport, capable of carrying out overhaul work on Airbus A320, as well as a cargo facility. The Royal Air Force also has a unit based within the airport – The Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde Air Squadron – to provide flying training to university students who plan to join the RAF.

In 2007, Glasgow became the second-busiest airport in Scotland as passenger numbers were surpassed by those at Edinburgh Airport.

====2007 terrorist attack====

On 30 June 2007, a day after the failed car bomb attacks in London, an attack at Glasgow International Airport occurred. A flaming Jeep Cherokee was driven into the entrance of Main Terminal. Two men, one alight, fled the vehicle before being apprehended by a combination of police officers, airport security officers and witnesses. One of the men died in the following months due to injuries sustained in the attack. New barriers and security measures have been added to prevent a similar incident from taking place.

====Airline expansion====

Icelandair temporarily moved its base of operations from Keflavík International Airport to Glasgow due to the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull.

On 10 April 2014, Emirates operated an Airbus A380 to Glasgow to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Glasgow – Dubai route, and was the first time an A380 had visited a Scottish airport.

In July 2014, Emirates opened a dedicated lounge at the airport for First and Business class passengers. It is located at the top of the West Pier. In October 2014, Heathrow Airport Holdings reached an agreement to sell the airport, together with Southampton and Aberdeen, to a consortium of Ferrovial and Macquarie Group for £1 billion.

In 2017, easyJet became the first airline to carry more than one million passengers from the airport in a period of 12 months.

====Airline route changes====

On 27 February 2018, Ryanair announced that it would close its base at Glasgow, and retain just three of its 22 routes. It cited the Scottish Government&#x27;s failure to replace Air Passenger Duty with a cheaper Air Departure Tax.

On 16 April 2019, Emirates launched a daily A380 flight on the Glasgow – Dubai route, making it the first regular A380 service in Scotland.

On 12 June 2021, Aer Lingus Regional operator Stobart Air entered liquidation resulting in all Aer Lingus routes to and from the airport being cancelled with immediate effect. Stobart Air has been replaced by Emerald Airlines in February 2022.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Glasgow:
===Cargo===
==General aviation==

===Gama aviation and air ambulance===
The Scottish Air Ambulance Services (SAS) contract involves the provision of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in addition to the coordination and operational management of all flights.
This long-term contract resulted in the company investing in the development of new infrastructure at the airport, with the creation of the Scottish Specialist Transport and Retrieval (ScotSTAR) facility.

===Flying schools===
Glasgow Airport is also the home of 2 flying schools, those being Glasgow Flying Club and Leading Edge Flight Training.

==Future==
===Investment area===

The Glasgow Airport Investment Area is a £39.1 million project to administer infrastructure and environmental improvements in the surrounding airport area to facilitate the development of a world-class business and commercial hub in the heart of Renfrewshire.

===Expansion plans===
In 2005, BAA published a consultation paper for the development of the airport. The consultation paper included proposals for a second runway parallel to and to the north-west of the existing runway 05/23; redevelopment and enlargement of the East (low-cost) pier to connect directly with Terminal 2; and an additional International Pier to the west of the existing International Pier. There were plans for a new rail terminal, joined to the airport&#x27;s passenger terminal and Multistorey car park. On 29 November 2006, the Scottish Parliament gave the go-ahead for the new railway station as part of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link to Glasgow Central station, originally due for completion in 2011. However, on 17 September 2009, due to escalating costs, the project was cancelled by the Scottish Government.

BAA&#x27;s plans, which are expected to cost some £290 million over the next 25 years, come in response to a forecasted trebling of annual passenger numbers passing through the airport by 2030. The current figure of 9.4 million passengers passing through the airport is expected to rise to more than 24 million by 2030.

As of late 2017, there are plans to build a light rail link that will connect the city centre to the airport via Govan, with plans already underway to begin construction of the project after the cancellation of the original Glasgow Airport Rail Link project. Since then this plan has been implemented into the lager Clyde Metro project.

===Proposed rail/metro link===
Plans for a rail link from the airport to Glasgow Central station were proposed in the 2000s, shelved in 2009 and then resurrected though progress towards the proposal has yet to come to fruition. In recent years a Larger scale plan known as Clyde Metro, currently in the planning stages aims to create a new metro system for the Glasgow city region which includes a link to the airport, the plan previously being proposed and led by Transport Scotland is now being developed by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport and is currently in the case for investment stage.

===Busiest routes===


==Accidents and incidents==
*A Norwegian Arado Ar 196A crashed near Glasgow in April 1940.
* On 3 September 1999, a Cessna 404 carrying nine Airtours staff from Glasgow to Aberdeen on a transfer flight, crashed minutes after takeoff near the town of Linwood, Renfrewshire. Eight people were killed and three seriously injured. No one on the ground was hurt. The Air Accident Investigation Branch determined the aircraft had developed an engine malfunction during takeoff. Although the captain decided to return to the airfield, he mistakenly identified the working engine as the faulty one and shut it down, causing the aircraft to crash. A fatal accident inquiry was also held, which reached the same conclusion.
* On 30 June 2007, a group of extremists attacked the airport by ramming a Jeep Cherokee into the entrance of the main terminal which set the car on fire. There was some damage to the airport. One of the perpetrators died in the hospital and the others were jailed.
* In August 2019, two drunken United Airlines pilots tried to fly a plane but were stopped by local authorities. They were arrested for being drunk. The plane was to leave for New York City.

==Ground transport==

===Bus===

The airport is linked to Glasgow City Centre by the 500 Glasgow Airport Express service. This is run by First Glasgow under contract to Glasgow Airport. Started in 2011, the service runs direct via the M8 motorway having previously been operated by Arriva Scotland West. McGill&#x27;s Bus Services also operate service 757 linking the airport with Paisley, Erskine and Clydebank.

===Road===

Glasgow Airport is the only airport in Scotland with direct motorway access, being right next to the M8 motorway making it extremely easy and simple to get to the city centre.

===Rail===

The closest railway station to the airport is Paisley Gilmour Street station with easy access for walking and cycling as well as a bus service operated by McGill’s from the terminal to the station.

<text>Glasgow Valley County Airport (Wokal Field) ) is a public airport a mile northeast of Glasgow, in Valley County, Montana, United States. It is served by one airline, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.

The Federal Aviation Administration says this airport had 4201 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2018, up 19.45% from 3517 enplanements in 2017. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a local general aviation facility.

Scheduled air service temporarily ceased on March 8, 2008, when Big Sky Airlines ended operations in bankruptcy. Great Lakes Airlines was given USDOT approval to take over Essential Air Service (EAS) and flights began in 2009. Service is currently provided under EAS contract by Cape Air.

==History==
Glasgow Army Air Field, also known as the Glasgow Satellite Airfield, was activated on November 10, 1942. It was one of three satellite fields of Great Falls Army Air Base which accommodated a bombardment group. There were four Bomber Squadrons within this group, one located at the Great Falls Army Air Base and one at each of the three satellite air fields at Lewistown, Glasgow and Cut Bank.

The 96th Bombardment Squadron of the Second Bombardment Group arrived at Glasgow Army Air Field on November 29, 1942. Heavy bomber squadrons of the time usually consisted of 8 B-17s with 37 officers and 229 enlisted men. The satellite field was used by B-17 bomber crews from the Second Air Force during the second phase of their training. Actual bombing and gunnery training was conducted at the airfield&#x27;s associated sites, Glasgow Pattern Bombing Range and the Glasgow Pattern Gunnery Range, though other training sites within the bombardment group were probably also used. The target-towing aircraft assigned to the Fort Peck Aerial Gunnery Range were also stationed at Glasgow. The last unit to complete training at Glasgow Satellite Field was the 614th Bombardment Squadron of the 401st Bombardment Group, which left for England in October 1943.

On December 1, 1944 a German prisoner-of-war camp was established at the site. On July 15, 1946 the Glasgow Army Air Field was classified surplus and it was transferred to the War Assets Administration on November 18, 1946.
The first airline flights were Frontier DC-3s in 1959; Frontier pulled out in 1980.

==Facilities==
The airport covers 1,552 acres (628 ha) at an elevation of 2,296 feet (700 m). It has two asphalt runways: 12/30 is 5,002 by 100 feet (1,525 x 30 m) and 8/26 is 5,000 by 75 feet (1,524 x 23 m).

In the year ending May 15, 2023, the airport had 8,230 aircraft operations, average 23 per day: 4,750 general aviation, 3,460 air taxi, and 20 military. In May 2023, 51 aircraft were based at the airport: 48 single-engine, 2 multi-engine, and 1 helicopter.

== Airline and destination ==
The airport has one passenger airline:

<doc id="280356" wikidata="Q371086" url="?curid=280356" title="White-eye">
<text>The white-eyes are a family, Zosteropidae, of small passerine birds native to tropical, subtropical and temperate Sub-Saharan Africa, southern and eastern Asia, and Australasia. White-eyes inhabit most tropical islands in the Indian Ocean, the western Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Guinea. Discounting some widespread members of the genus &quot;Zosterops&quot;, most species are endemic to single islands or archipelagos. The silvereye, &quot;Zosterops lateralis&quot;, naturally colonised New Zealand, where it is known as the &quot;wax-eye&quot; or &quot;tauhou&quot; (&quot;stranger&quot;), from 1855. The silvereye has also been introduced to the Society Islands in French Polynesia, while the Japanese white-eye has been introduced to Hawaii.

==Characteristics==
White-eyes are mostly of undistinguished appearance, the plumage being generally greenish olive above, and pale grey below. Some species have a white or bright yellow throat, breast, or lower parts, and several have buff flanks. As their common name implies, many species have a conspicuous ring of tiny white feathers around their eyes. The scientific name of the group also reflects this latter feature, being derived from the Ancient Greek for &quot;girdle-eye&quot;. They have rounded wings and strong legs. Like many other nectarivorous birds, they have slender, pointed bills, and brush-tipped tongues. The size ranges up to in length.

All the species of white-eyes are sociable, forming large flocks that only separate on the approach of the breeding season. They build trees nests and lay two to four eggs which are usually pale blue. Though mainly insectivorous, they eat nectar and fruits of various kinds. The silvereye can be a problem in Australian vineyards, by piercing the grape allowing infection or insect damage to follow.

==Systematics==
The family Zosteropidae was introduced (as a subfamily Zosteropinae) in 1853 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The white-eyes were long considered a distinct family Zosteropidae because they are rather homogeneous in morphology and ecology, leading to little adaptive radiation and divergence.

The genus &quot;Apalopteron&quot;, formerly placed in the Meliphagidae, was transferred to the white eyes in 1995 on genetic and behavioral evidence. It differs much in appearance from the typical white-eyes, &quot;Zosterops&quot;, but is approached by some Micronesian taxa; its color pattern is fairly unusual save the imperfect white eye-ring.

In 2003, Alice Cibois published the results of her study of mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and 12S/16S rRNA sequence data. According to her results, the white-eyes were likely to form a clade also containing the yuhinas, which were until then placed with the Old World babblers, a large &quot;wastebin&quot; family. Previous molecular studies (e.g. Sibley &amp; Ahlquist 1990, Barker &quot;et al.&quot; 2002) had together with the morphological evidence tentatively placed white-eyes as the Timaliidae&#x27;s closest relatives already. But some questions remained, mainly because the white-eyes are all very similar birds in habitus and habits, while the Old World babblers are very diverse (because, as we now know, the group as formerly defined was polyphyletic).

Combined with the yuhinas (and possibly other Timaliidae), the limits of the white-eye clade to the &quot;true&quot; Old World babblers becomes indistinct. Therefore, the current (early 2007) opinion weighs towards merging the group into the Timaliidae, perhaps as a subfamily (&quot;Zosteropinae&quot;). Few white-eyes have been thoroughly studied with the new results in mind, however, and almost all of these are from &quot;Zosterops&quot; which even at this point appears over-lumped. Also, many &quot;Old World babblers&quot; remain in unresolved relationships. Whether there can be a clear delimitation of a white-eye subfamily or even a young or emerging family is a question that requires a more comprehensive study of both this group and Timaliidae to resolve (Jønsson &amp; Fjeldså 2006).

For example, a revision of the yuhinas and the genus &quot;Stachyris&quot; (Cibois &quot;et al.&quot; 2002), based on the same genes as Cibois (2003), revealed that the Philippine species placed in the latter genus by some were actually yuhinas. However, when the review by Jønsson &amp; Fjeldså (2006) was published, no study had tried to propose a phylogeny for the newly defined yuhinas including the white eyes. Therefore, Jønsson &amp; Fjeldså (2006) give a rather misleading phylogeny for the group. It appears as if the yuhinas are polyphyletic, with the white-collared yuhina being closer to the ancestor of the &quot;Zosterops&quot; white-eyes than to other yuhinas including the species moved from &quot;Stachyris&quot; (Cibois &quot;et al.&quot; 2002).

In the past, the Madanga (&quot;Madanga ruficollis&quot;) was included in this family but studies now place it as an atypical member of the Motacillidae.

The cladogram below showing the relationships between families is based on a study of babblers by Tianlong Cai and collaborators published in 2019.
The cladogram below showing the relationships between the genera is based on the study by Carl Oliveros and collaborators that was published in 2021. The genera &quot;Apalopteron&quot;, &quot;Tephrozosterops&quot; and &quot;Rukia&quot; were not sampled in this study. The genus &quot;Megazosterops&quot; was found to be nested in &quot;Heleia&quot;. The earlier study by Cai and collaborators found a generally similar phylogeny but with &quot;Cleptornis&quot; as sister to &quot;Heleia&quot;. Cai&#x27;s study found that &quot;Apalopteron&quot; was nested within &quot;Heleia&quot; with weak support and that &quot;Tephrozosterops&quot; was sister to &quot;Zosterops&quot;.
==List of genera==
The family contains 149 species divided into 13 genera:

* &quot;Parayuhina&quot; – white-collared yuhina
* &quot;Staphida&quot; – (3 species)
* &quot;Yuhina&quot; – yuhinas (7 species) 
* &quot;Dasycrotapha&quot; – babbler and pygmy babblers (3 species)
* &quot;Sterrhoptilus&quot; – babblers (4 species)
* &quot;Zosterornis&quot; – striped babblers (5 species)
* &quot;Cleptornis&quot; – golden white-eye
* &quot;Rukia&quot; – white-eyes (2 species)
* &quot;Megazosterops&quot; – giant white-eye
* &quot;Heleia&quot; – heleias (10 species) 
* &quot;Apalopteron&quot; – Bonin white-eye
* &quot;Tephrozosterops&quot; – rufescent darkeye
* &quot;Zosterops&quot; – (110 species including 3 recently extinct)

<text>Premier was an American brand of smokeless cigarettes which was owned and manufactured by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR). Premier was released in the United States in 1988. It was the first commercial heated tobacco product. However, it was difficult to use and tasted unpleasant; as a result, it was unpopular with consumers. A commercial failure, the brand was a significant financial loss for RJR and was quickly taken off the market.

==Design and development==
The cigarettes looked like conventional cigarettes, but featured a hard casing and contained only a small amount of processed tobacco along with flavor beads. Lighting a carbon tip on the end of the cigarette would heat the tobacco and the flavor beads, allowing the inhalation of a nicotine aerosol with minimal smoke and no tar. Developed as a reaction to a growing anti-smoking sentiment, Premier cigarettes were designed to reduce or eliminate unhealthy side effects associated with smoking, both to the smoker and to the people around the smoker. RJR hoped that smokers concerned about these health effects would switch to Premier instead of quitting smoking.

Unfortunately for RJR, smokers across multiple test markets disliked the product for multiple reasons, primarily concerning flavor and ease of use. It was unpopular with users when it was test-marketed in Arizona and Missouri. Research conducted in the United States found that less than 5% of smokers enjoyed the taste. Research in Japan was even less promising: reportedly, researchers were explicitly told, &quot;This tastes like shit.&quot; Lighting the cigarettes with sulfur matches caused a reaction between the sulfur and the carbon tip that resulted in an odor that RJR&#x27;s own chief executive officer F. Ross Johnson described as &quot;like a fart.&quot; Finally, they were frustratingly difficult for smokers to draw on.

While RJR itself questioned whether the device functioned adequately as a nicotine delivery device, activists derided it for its potential for use in delivery of street drugs such as crack cocaine. The American Medical Association and other organizations recommended that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should restrict it or classify it as a drug.

In 1989, after spending an estimated $300 to $325 million to develop and deploy Premier, R. J. Reynolds pulled the device from the market after only months. Total losses from the failure are estimated at $800 million to $1 billion.

R.J. Reynolds reintroduced the concept behind the Premier cigarette as the Eclipse brand in the 1990s.

==Tylee Wilson==
Tylee Wilson was the CEO of RJR Nabisco, the then parent company of RJR. Controversy arose when J. Paul Sticht, then the chairman of the board of directors, noticed a new Reynolds building in Winston-Salem. His driver told him, &quot;That&#x27;s where they&#x27;re going to work on that smokeless cigarette.&quot; Sticht learned that Wilson had been hiding this boondoggle from the board of directors for five years, since 1981. Wilson argued that the project would help take back the lead in the tobacco industry from Philip Morris, who had recently overtaken Reynolds. Due to the growing health controversies related to tobacco, Wilson hoped Premier would keep smokers from quitting and draw ex-smokers back to Reynolds. He argued that the project was kept under wraps because it was unclear when development of the product would be completed.

Wilson was brought before the board of directors, some of whom thought the cigarette tasted and smelled unpleasant, but their main concern was Wilson&#x27;s lack of disclosure. Hundreds of employees, including the chairman&#x27;s driver, had known about the project, an ad agency was being consulted, outside scientists and suppliers were in the loop. It seemed like Wilson only held disclosure from his board. When addressing his lack of transparency, board member Juanita M. Kreps said, &quot;I, for one, absolutely resent that.&quot; At this point Wilson had authorized $68 million for the development of Premier, an amount he was not allowed to approve without consent from the audit committee.

F. Ross Johnson, the COO and President of RJR Nabisco would be chosen as the new CEO. In an effort to quickly oust Wilson, a pact was made between him and the board of directors: Wilson would be given a lump-sum of $3.25 million, have continuation of his salary, and a bonus of $1.3 million until his official retirement at the end of 1987 with retirement pay of $600,000 thereafter.

<doc id="280458" wikidata="Q380215" url="?curid=280458" title="Roll the Bones">
<text>Roll the Bones is the fourteenth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released September 3, 1991, on Anthem Records. The band began working on the album after a brief creative hiatus following the tour promoting their previous release, &quot;Presto&quot; (1989).

&quot;Roll the Bones&quot; was a return to commercial success for the band, reaching No. 3 in the United States, No. 10 in the UK, and No. 11 in Canada. The album won a Juno Award for Best Album Design at the 1992 Juno Awards. In August 2001, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies in the US. It was remastered in 2004 and again in 2013 as part of &quot;The Studio Albums 1989–2007&quot; box set. In 2015, it was reissued after being remastered by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios, following a direct approach by Rush to remaster their entire back catalogue.

==Background and writing==
In June 1990, Rush finished touring their previous album, &quot;Presto&quot; (1989). They purposely kept the tour short, which Lee said was due to the group feeling overcautious about touring the album. However, it became an enjoyable and positive experience for them, and by the time it finished, &quot;we were so charged up we wanted to keep on playing.&quot; This renewed energy in the band carried through to the writing and recording sessions for &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;. They then took a break, but decided to cut it short in order to start work on new material for a follow-up record.

As with &quot;Presto&quot;, Rush started work by retreating to Chalet Studios, a remote studio in Claremont, Ontario. They stayed for months, with Lee and Lifeson working on the music while Peart wrote lyrics. The three would reconvene in the evenings, when Peart would hear what the other two had come up with during the day. Lee had developed an interest in bird watching, and ensured some broken bird feeders by the studio window were repaired and filled with feed, which he enjoyed observing while writing. The album&#x27;s liner notes include a thanks to birds.

The demos were recorded using an eight-track TASCAM 388 recorder and an integrated mixer hooked up to a sequencer running C-Lab Notator software. Lee set up simple drum patterns on the computer for Lifeson and himself to work from. It took between nine and ten weeks to write and rehearse for the album, and eight weeks to record it.

The album displays the continued change in the group&#x27;s sound which started on &quot;Presto&quot;, with a reduction in keyboards and a return to guitar-driven songs. Lee said the change was &quot;a backlash against the more computer-style of writing&quot; which had dominated their sound through the 1980s, and the band now chose to use synthesizers and sequencers as an &quot;orchestration device&quot;, rather than a key component in the songwriting. The writing sessions for &quot;Presto&quot; had involved just bass, guitar, and vocals, which contributed to the style shift, and the group continued with this approach for &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;. Another aspect that carried over from &quot;Presto&quot; was Lee&#x27;s intention to come up with strong vocal melodies at the beginning and base the rest of the tune around it. Lifeson had wanted to try playing funk rhythms and, after having attempted it on &quot;Presto&quot;, wished to explore it further on &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;. The majority of the arrangements worked out at the writing stage remained unchanged, which allowed the group to use the demos as a guide for recording, done by transferring the completed demos to 24-track and re-recording the parts.

The album contains a running lyrical theme concerning the element of chance in different aspects of life, which Peart had devised while experimenting with lyrics. The first lyric that he wrote for the album was used on &quot;Face Up&quot;, specifically: &quot;Turn it up – or turn that wild card down.&quot; He recalled sitting on his cottage floor &quot;with a pile of papers around me&quot; of notes from the previous two years, mostly consisting of phrases written on tour or during &quot;that dreamlike moment before sleep.&quot; He started to experiment with the phrases &quot;turn it up&quot; and &quot;turn it down&quot;, which led to the idea of turning a card down and a wild card, and applied them to events that a person may face.

==Recording==
&quot;Roll the Bones&quot; was recorded at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and McClear Place in Toronto, between February and May 1991. The band resumed working with co-producer Rupert Hine and engineer Stephen Tayler, both of whom had worked on &quot;Presto&quot;. The vocals were recorded in England. Rush wanted to continue to work with Hine due to his accomplished songwriting, the feedback he gave their songs and his ability to allow the group to achieve a looser sound than previous albums. Lee said that various production tricks they had learned from working with Peter Collins in the 1980s were used on &quot;Presto&quot; and &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;.

The bass and drum parts were recorded in four days, and the guitars in eight. Lee was amazed at how Peart had learned his parts for an entire song prior to recording it, and that &quot;Nine times out of 10 it took only one pass for him to nail it.&quot; The band had originally planned to release the album in January 1992, but they finished it two months early. They thanked the news channel CNN in the liner notes, as they had the channel on while writing, and Lee recalled it was sometimes difficult to stop watching it while numerous events were taking place.

Lee used two different Wal basses on the album. He liked its mid-range and &quot;rich&quot; bottom end sound, and the fact that he did not have to add much equalisation. He first learned of the instrument when the band were recording in England, and knew that bassist Percy Jones used one on Brand X albums, of which he was a big fan. Lee had played one at the suggestion of Peter Collins during the recording of &quot;Power Windows&quot; (1985). Lee&#x27;s bass was mixed closer to Peart&#x27;s bass drum range, which freed up space in the music for guitar parts. Peart also changed his sound, and while he did not make a conscious decision to avoid electronics altogether, he found that most of the songs did not benefit from him playing an electronic kit and instead mostly used acoustic drums. Peart realized that he had a tendency to make his drum parts &quot;too organized, too architectural&quot; on an album, so for &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;, he deliberately left portions of songs unrehearsed and recorded them on the day of recording with the intention of capturing more spontaneous playing.

Peart wrote that the group found each stage of the recording process particularly enjoyable and satisfying, which sparked a &quot;new conviction, a sense of rebirth&quot; within the group. Lee described the writing sessions for the album as &quot;very positive&quot; and &quot;optimistic&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover was designed by longtime Rush associate Hugh Syme. The liner notes contain the cryptic phrase &quot;Now it&#x27;s dark.&quot; Peart later revealed that the phrase occurs in the 1986 film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. The credits include a running joke that began on &quot;Power Windows&quot;, when the group noticed several song titles began with the letter &quot;M&quot;. For &quot;various reasons&quot;, they continued the gag on &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;, with &quot;Brought to you by the letter B.&quot;

==Songs==
===Side one===
The opening verse of &quot;Dreamline&quot; has references to astronomy, which Peart was inspired by after bicycling a hundred miles from Cincinnati to Columbus between two gigs on the Presto tour. Upon arrival, he watched the popular science series &quot;Nova&quot; on PBS, and a program on satellite imaging captured his imagination.

&quot;Bravado&quot; deals with how one should not give up after failing, as opposed to ending life by suicide, which Peart had addressed in &quot;The Pass&quot; on &quot;Presto&quot;. The song was particularly emotional for Lee, who rated it as one of the band&#x27;s best ever songs, partly due to its different texture than the rest of the album. The band was optimistic about its musical form but faced the problem of overworking its arrangement because all the parts sounded good to them. In the end, they learned that stripping the song back resulted in a stronger track.

&quot;Roll the Bones&quot; was named after a science fiction story by Fritz Leiber that Peart had read some 15 years prior, titled &quot;Gonna Roll the Bones&quot;. Though the story had no influence on the music or its message, Peart took a liking to the particular phrase and had kept it in his notebook. The phrase is also a slang term for rolling dice. When the band was recording &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;, Lee said they decided to &quot;have some fun&quot; with it and include a rap section. Peart recalled some skepticism from his bandmates at first and they tried different ways to present it, including a female voice, but &quot;the transition was too harsh.&quot; They instead opted to use Lee&#x27;s voice with low-frequency effects applied to it.

&quot;Where&#x27;s My Thing?&quot; was the band&#x27;s first instrumental since &quot;YYZ&quot; from &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981). It has the humorous subtitle of &quot;Part IV, &#x27;Gangster of Boats&#x27; Trilogy&quot;, referring to an inside joke where Lee and Lifeson threatened to name a Rush album &quot;Gangster of Boats&quot; if Peart ever had difficulty coming up with a title, as well as the joke that it&#x27;s the fourth part of a trilogy. Peart wrote that the group had wanted to record an instrumental for a while at this point and that the group had &quot;a lot of fun&quot; recording it. They had wanted to include one on &quot;Presto&quot;, but every time Lee and Lifeson had a piece of music, Peart provided a lyric that fit well with it. For this album, Peart let the two write an instrumental track and deliberately avoided providing them lyrics until they had put one together. Rather than making the track a showcase for the group&#x27;s playing ability, Lee and Lifeson wanted to give it a verse and chorus section to make it sound like a &quot;genuine song&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Heresy&quot; is a more straightforward rock song with a rhythm that Lee described as a &quot;heart beat pulse&quot; that reflected some of Peart&#x27;s lyrical ideas for it. Peart was inspired by the events surrounding the fall of Communism in eastern Europe in the early 1990s and people regaining their freedoms.

&quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot; features Lifeson playing a PRS guitar, and he rated his solo on the track as one of his best. Lyrically the song is based on the compromises that one makes in a relationship to make it work. Peart was particularly proud of his words for it, as he had written a love song that avoided the clichés of more typical, sentimental love song lyrics.

Lee said that, despite the fun involved in writing &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, it was the most difficult to record, partly due to getting a balance in the chorus between the vocals and the vocal melody. It was also hard to mix, and Lee &quot;never felt confident that we actually nailed [it].&quot;

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Roll the Bones&quot; was released on September 3, 1991. It marked a return to commercial success for the band, reaching No. 3 in the US, their highest charting album since &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981). It also reached No. 10 in the UK and No. 11 in Canada. &quot;Dreamline&quot; reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart. In 1992, &quot;Where&#x27;s My Thing? (Part IV, &quot;Gangster of Boats&quot; Trilogy)&quot; became Rush&#x27;s second song to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. The song lost to &quot;Cliffs of Dover&quot; by Eric Johnson, who opened for Rush on the 1991 leg of the Roll the Bones Tour.

Rush toured the album between October 1991 and July 1992, covering Canada, the United States, mainland Europe and the UK. As they had a productive and positive experience making the album, they were keen to go on the road and tour the album and toured longer than they had for &quot;Presto&quot;.

==Reception==
Chuck Eddy of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt the album treaded new ground, noting its &quot;usual melodic nods toward MTV metal and 19th-century concert halls&quot; now had &quot;rhythmic nods toward Nintendo games and West Africa.&quot; Eddy also noted the rap in the title track, concluding, &quot;For once, these guys seem to be acting silly on purpose.&quot;

In retrospective reviews, Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic called &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; &quot;quite possibly Rush&#x27;s darkest album&quot; lyrically, citing &quot;Dreamline&quot; as one of the band&#x27;s best songs of the &#x27;90s. He added that, &quot;though their negative subject matter can feel stifling at times, fine tracks like &#x27;Bravado,&#x27; &#x27;The Big Wheel,&#x27; and &#x27;Heresy&#x27; feature wonderful melodies and arrangements.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; on their list of &quot;Top 100 90&#x27;s Rock Albums&quot;. They also ranked it the 9th (out of 19) best Rush album, with Dave Swanson writing, &quot;even though synths still clang about and a few of the experiments go too far (um, yes, that&#x27;s Geddy Lee rapping on the title track), the songwriting is stupendous.&quot;

<text>At the Drive-In was an American post-hardcore band from El Paso, Texas, formed in 1994. The band&#x27;s most recent line-up consisted of Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals), Omar Rodríguez-López (guitar, vocals), Paul Hinojos (bass), Tony Hajjar (drums) and Keeley Davis (guitar, vocals).

After several early line-up changes, the band solidified into a five-piece, consisting of Bixler-Zavala, Rodríguez-López, Jim Ward, Hinojos and Hajjar. At the Drive-In released three studio albums and five EPs before breaking up in 2001. Their third and final album before their split, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Relationship of Command&quot;, received a number of accolades and is cited as a landmark of the post-hardcore genre. Following the breakup, Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López formed the Mars Volta while Ward, Hinojos, and Hajjar formed Sparta; Hinojos would later join the Mars Volta.

At the Drive-In reunited in January 2012 and played the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, as well as the 2012 Lollapalooza Festival. In 2016, the band reunited for a second time, with guitarist and occasional lead vocalist Jim Ward no longer participating. He was replaced by Sparta&#x27;s Keeley Davis. The band released their fourth studio album, &quot;in•ter a•li•a&quot;, in 2017. The band announced an indefinite hiatus in November 2018.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot; (1994–97)===

At the Drive-In was founded in 1994 by guitarist Jim Ward and vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala. The newly formed band played its first live show on October 14, 1994, at The Attic, a venue in El Paso, Texas, followed up by a show on the 15th at the Loretto High School Fair. Not long after, At the Drive-In released its first studio recording entitled &quot;Hell Paso&quot;, a 7-inch EP issued in November 1994. Following &quot;Hell Paso&quot; release, the band members embarked on their first tour – a 2,000-mile trek across the state of Texas. After a drummer change due to Bernie Rincon&#x27;s death, At the Drive-In released its second EP &quot;¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo!&quot; in June 1995. The band then set out on another tour, this one in a newly purchased 1981 Ford Econoline and spanning 42 days and 10,000 miles across the United States. During these tours, At the Drive-In began developing a large underground following by mostly playing in basements and small venues across the western United States, with their popularity spread by word of mouth among fans. One such show that changed the course of history for the band was in a now defunct bar in Los Angeles, where the band put on an explosive performance for just nine people – some of them employees of the Flipside record label. The staffers were so enthralled by the show that they offered to put out At the Drive-In&#x27;s record then and there. Accepting the offer, the band first headed out on another 21-day tour of the Southwest before ending in Los Angeles again where they recorded their debut full-length album titled &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot; for $600.

The album was released August 18, 1996, and the band commenced another tour of the United States the following year spanning 100 days (February to June 1997) and 24,000 miles. This tour included shows with hundreds of other bands such as Screw 32, J Church, AFI, Still Life, Mustard Plug, Face to Face, and Cosmic Psychos. At the Drive-In&#x27;s fan base began to swell with every show it performed. Following this tour, the band members took a month vacation (Jim Ward remained on vacation until the recording of &quot;In/Casino/Out&quot;) before rehearsing for their next record and subsequent tour.
Following the recording of &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot; in July 1996, the final line-up of At the Drive-In fell into place with the addition of Tony Hajjar and Paul Hinojos and with Omar Rodríguez-López transitioning from bass to guitar. At the Drive-In&#x27;s third EP titled &quot;El Gran Orgo&quot; was released on September 18, 1997, and &quot;showed a more melodic side of the band, but the musical depth and heartfelt emotion was never more apparent.&quot; Two days after its release, the band was in Boulder, Colorado, playing a show with Welt to kick off its next 35-day, 11,000-mile tour that also included six dates with Karp and the Young Pioneers, and one-offs with Guttermouth, The Criminals, Piss Drunks, and the Humpers. At the Drive-In&#x27;s popularity at this point was undeniable, with headlining shows in the Midwest drawing between 100 and 350 fans.

===&quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; and &quot;Vaya&quot; (1998–1999)===

When the time came for At the Drive-In&#x27;s next recording, Flipside quit producing records and Offtime was financially unable to, &quot;so the band figuratively approached almost every indie label they could think of.&quot; When hope was almost lost and the possibility of another record seemed dim, Bob and Michelle Becker of Fearless Records saw At the Drive-In open for Supernova at a bar named Club Mesa. Despite Fearless&#x27;s history of producing mainly pop punk bands, the band members &quot;felt very comfortable with Bob and Michelle on a personal level&quot; and a deal was signed. Consequently, At the Drive-In began recording its second full-length album titled &quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; on June 3, 1998. With producer and mixer Alex Newport, the band spent four days recording at Doug Messenger&#x27;s, in North Hollywood, Revolver Recordings in Costa Mesa with Engineer Andy Troy for Fearless Records, and an additional two days mixing the album at Paramount, in Hollywood. This album marked a notable maturation in At the Drive-In&#x27;s sound and is special in that it was recorded live with just a small number of overdubs. &quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; was chosen to be recorded live because, according to some sources, At the Drive-In struggled to capture the intensity and emotion of its live shows in the recording studio.

&quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; was released on August 18, 1998, although the band toured almost non-stop from July until December, playing shows with bands like Knapsack and The Murder City Devils. At the Drive-In took a couple month break until March 1999, at which point they kicked off another tour with a two-week stint with Jimmy Eat World in the United States until they headed to Europe for a six-week European tour spanning eleven countries. Upon returning to the United States, At the Drive-In played a handful of shows before returning to the studio to record their fourth EP entitled &quot;Vaya&quot;, which was released on July 13, 1999. Without missing a beat, the band kicked off another tour on July 28 at Emo&#x27;s in Austin, Texas, with El Paso band Universal Recovered and Austin band Schatzi opening this show. This tour included shows with bands like The Get Up Kids and Rage Against the Machine. Later, in April 2000, At the Drive-In released a split EP with the Czech band Sunshine, containing five songs, two of them by At the Drive-In.

===&quot;Relationship of Command&quot; (2000–2001)===

Recording for At the Drive-In&#x27;s third and then-final full-length album &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; began on January 17, 2000. The recording took place at Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu, California, with producer Ross Robinson (and mixer Andy Wallace), who the band had met on an earlier tour and who had &quot;convinced the boys that he was the guy who could get every ounce of them onto tape.&quot; &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; was recorded over a seven-week period and featured Iggy Pop with minor parts on a couple of the album&#x27;s songs. It was released September 12, 2000, to critical acclaim, and catapulted At the Drive-In into the mainstream musical spotlight.

In addition to touring worldwide in Europe, Japan, and the United States following the release of &quot;Relationship of Command&quot;, At The Drive-In performed on several television shows. The band&#x27;s first nationally televised performance was on &quot;Farmclub&quot;, a now defunct television show which aired late at night on the USA Network. After that performance, they also appeared on &quot;Later with Jools Holland,&quot; &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Additionally, their minor hit radio single &quot;One Armed Scissor&quot; had circulation on MTV and significantly contributed to the band&#x27;s popularity. By 2002, &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; had sold 273,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

===Breakup (2001)===
On November 12, 2000, At the Drive-In was involved in a motor vehicle accident when their touring van skidded out of control on ice and flipped onto its roof. Though the accident left the band shaken, none of the members sustained serious injury – Hajjar and Bixler-Zavala were taken to the hospital for minor injuries and released. In January 2001, At the Drive-In traveled to Australia for the Big Day Out music festival. While performing in Sydney, they left partway through their set after telling the attendance to calm down and observe the safety rules against moshing. After the refusal of the crowd, frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala told them &quot;You&#x27;re a robot, you&#x27;re a sheep!&quot; and bleated at them several times before the band left the stage after performing only three songs. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a very, very sad day when the only way you can express yourself is through slam-dancing&quot;, he proclaimed. The following month, At the Drive-In cancelled the last five dates of its European tour, citing &quot;complete mental and physical exhaustion&quot; of the members.

In March 2001—less than a month away from a United States tour set to begin on April 14—at the peak of their popularity and following a world tour, At the Drive-In broke up, initially referring to the split as an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;. The band played their last show at Groningen&#x27;s Vera venue on February 21, 2001. A combination of excessive hype, relentless touring, artistic differences, and Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s drug habits contributed to the demise of the band. Commenting on the hiatus, guitarist Rodríguez-López said: &quot;After a non-stop six-year cycle of record/tour/record/tour, we are going on an indefinite hiatus. We need time to rest up and re-evaluate, just to be human beings again and to decide when we feel like playing music again.&quot;

Cedric Bixler-Zavala took responsibility for the breakup, saying repeatedly in interviews that he felt almost as if At the Drive-In was holding him back and that he did not want his music to be confined to punk or hardcore — that it should encompass many genres and be even more progressive, alternative, and &quot;against-the-grain.&quot; Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López had stated that they wanted their next album to sound like Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, while the other members were intent on progressing in a more alternative rock direction.

===Post-breakup activity (2001–2009)===
Following the break-up of At the Drive-In, Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López focused on their dub side-project De Facto, before starting The Mars Volta. This project was a departure from their previous work, as it pursued the progressive rock sound that they had been interested in. Meanwhile, the other members – Ward, Hinojos, and Hajjar – started the more traditional band Sparta. Hinojos would then leave Sparta to join Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López in The Mars Volta from 2005 to 2009. The Mars Volta disbanded in 2013, and Rodríguez-López went on to play with Bosnian Rainbows, while Bixler-Zavala started a new band called Zavalaz. Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López eventually reunited once again and formed Antemasque in 2014.

===First reunion (2009–2012)===
During an interview with Drowned in Sound in June 2009, Bixler-Zavala stated that he had been in discussions with the band&#x27;s former members and suggested that they could get back together after they sorted their financial business out. He added, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind it. It might happen, we just have to iron out a lot of personal things. A lot of it we&#x27;ve dealt with already and I&#x27;ve apologized for a lot of things I&#x27;ve said and the way it ended... we&#x27;ll see what happens.&quot;

In response to Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s comments, guitarist Jim Ward quickly quashed rumors of a reunion by stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll be answering any questions or doing any interviews anymore, thank you very much. I haven&#x27;t got much to say about anything except with songs which I will continue to make and release.&quot;

At the Drive-in finally got back together in late 2011 and officially announced their reunion on January 9, 2012. They played their first show since 2001 on April 9 at Red 7 in Austin, Texas, as part of a 4-date tour across Texas with Zechs Marquise warming up prior to performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 15 and 22. Later in the year At the Drive-in also performed at festivals such as Lollapalooza, Splendour in the Grass, Fuji Rock and Reading and Leeds Festival.

The band had also acquired the rights from Fearless Records to reissue most of their catalogue (three full-length albums as well as &quot;Vaya&quot; EP) and launched their own label, Twenty-first Chapter, to handle the reissues. The name of the label is a reference to the chapter omitted from the US version of the Anthony Burgess book &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

While the reunion shows were met with mostly positive reviews, Rodríguez-López received criticism from fans and observers for his evident lack of enthusiasm while playing on stage; initially this was attributed to the recent death of his mother; however, Rodríguez-López later stated that he also no longer felt connected with At the Drive-in&#x27;s music.

Rodríguez-López also ruled out the possibility of the band recording new material, though he reversed this stance in light of the band&#x27;s 2016 reunion.

Following the dissolution of The Mars Volta in 2013, Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López ceased all contact with each other. Bixler-Zavala blamed Rodríguez-López for the breakup on Twitter; however, he stated that he was still happy with At the Drive-In&#x27;s reunion: &quot;And for the record I&#x27;m still in love with ATDI. Proof was in MY performance. I would never get on stage if my heart was elsewhere.&quot; The two subsequently focused their efforts on their respective projects, Zavalaz and Bosnian Rainbows, and remained on non-speaking terms until early 2014, when they finally resolved their issues. An initial attempt to restart At the Drive-In did not work out, however, so Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López went on to form Antemasque, touring and recording for the next two years.

===Second reunion and &quot;in•ter a•li•a&quot; (2015–2018)===

In October 2015, At the Drive-In agreed on doing another reunion, and an appearance at Rock On The Range festival in the following May was scheduled. In January 2016, trailed by a 15-second video of seemingly new music, the band detailed plans for a world tour and new album later in the year. After initial rehearsals, Jim Ward left the reunited band, and was replaced by his former Sparta bandmate Keeley Davis.

Looking back on Ward&#x27;s departure, in 2017 Bixler-Zavala stated that Ward was not ready for a new album and tour: &quot;His head wasn&#x27;t there. His head wasn&#x27;t trustworthy. Because of the way Omar and I exploded [with Mars Volta], I completely understood that. You know, you either let it go and keep going forward, or the train goes on without you. We have to honor what is happening now, which is age and the want to do it. I love him. He&#x27;s a beautiful human being. A beautiful artist. I just wish he would remember that he&#x27;s an amazing guitar player. I don&#x27;t know if he does.&quot;

The band canceled part of their North American tour after Bixler-Zavala began to have issues with his voice. On December 8, the band released their first new song in 16 years, &quot;Governed by Contagions&quot;, through Rise Records. A new album, &quot;in•ter a•li•a&quot;, was released on May 5, 2017, preceded by another single, &quot;Incurably Innocent&quot;. The &quot;Diamanté&quot; EP was released on November 24 as part of Record Store Day; it had a limited vinyl release of 4000 copies. In August 2017, the reunited band performed at Rock en Seine in Paris, France and in May 2018, the band headlined the Neon Desert Music Festival.

===Hiatus (2018–present)===
During a show on November 17, 2018, at the Circo Voador in Brazil, Bixler-Zavala announced to the crowd that the following night&#x27;s show would be their final show for the foreseeable future. That night, Bixler-Zavala posted on Twitter stating &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s a sign of weakness to some of you but I had to give a huge thank you to my ATDI family. This was our 2nd to last show. Tomorrow is the last. Don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ll play again. Thank you Rio. How do I even sleep now?&quot; The following day on November 18, 2018, the band played their final show at Bar Opinião in Porto Alegre, Brazil. On November 19, 2018, the band released a statement on their official Instagram announcing a hiatus.

==Musical style and influences==
At the Drive-In&#x27;s style is usually described as post-hardcore. Their sound has also been called punk rock, emo, and art punk. Some of the group&#x27;s influences are Indian Summer, Swing Kids, Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate (referred to by Ward as &quot;Fugazi beyond Fugazi&quot;), Bad Brains, and the Gravity Records-led post-hardcore sound of the 1990s that featured acts such as Antioch Arrow and Heroin. In their last period before their initial breakup, the biggest influences of At the Drive-In included bands such as Drive Like Jehu, Hot Snakes, and The Nation of Ulysses, with frontman Bixler-Zavala going on to say that &quot;there would be no &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; without Drive Like Jehu.&quot; The band also performed cover versions of songs such as &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes&quot; by The Smiths and &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot; by Pink Floyd, both included in the 2004 compilation &quot;This Station Is Non-Operational&quot;. Their name was taken from the fact that Bad Brains took their name from the Ramones&#x27; song &quot;Bad Brain&quot; (from &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;), and Bixler-Zavala liked the Bad Brains&#x27; song title &quot;At the Movies&quot; (featured in &quot;Rock for Light&quot;), while Ward liked &quot;at the drive-in&quot; from the chorus of the Poison song &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot; and his suggestion would eventually win out.

Though &quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; was recorded live, &quot;&quot;Relationship of Command&quot; may very well be the first record to harness the chaotic balance of adrenaline and intellect of ATDI&#x27;s live performance.&quot; &quot;Ross was instrumental in bringing out a lot of feeling from us,&quot; Bixler-Zavala recalls. &quot;We channeled a lot of emotion into this record. He pushed us farther than we thought we could go. I learned to cut loose the way we do live and not to be afraid to break something or whatever.&quot; While capturing the essence of ATDI&#x27;s live shows in a way never before seen, the record also featured some of the band&#x27;s most experimental songs, including &quot;Rolodex Propaganda,&quot; &quot;Non-Zero Possibility,&quot; and &quot;Invalid Litter Dept.&quot;

The band&#x27;s guitar-playing, in the majority of their songs, is characterized by unusual chords, a fast tempo, and a quiet-loud-quiet song structure. While Jim Ward and Paul Hinojos provided the rhythmic structure of the song, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez often played more experimental riffs and melodies over the top. Effects were heavily used by Rodriguez-Lopez, especially on &quot;Relationship of Command,&quot; while Ward used the keyboard to create melody, often switching between the guitar and keyboard such as in &quot;Invalid Litter Department&quot;.

==Legacy==
At the Drive-In is considered one of the most influential post-hardcore artists of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Accolades for their album &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; include being ranked 47th in the 50 Greatest Albums of the 21st century in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, 83rd on &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; 100 Greatest Albums 1985–2005, and 90 on MTV2&#x27;s greatest albums ever list. BBC&#x27;s Mike Diver stated that the success and eventual &quot;landmark status&quot; of the album helped post-hardcore position itself as a &quot;vital commercial force,&quot; adding that &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; &quot;is the high against which every post-hardcore record since 2000 has been measured.&quot;

In October 2011, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; magazine inducted &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; into Rock Sound&#x27;s &quot;Hall Of Fame&quot;. Their writer Ryan Bird spoke about the legacy of the album, stating that &quot;though At the Drive-In may not have built the road, they were most certainly leading the convoy, allowing those who followed behind to reap the of their navigation while they crashed and burned on the hard shoulder. What remains, however, is a legacy the likes of which may not been seen again.&quot;

Among the artists who have cited At the Drive-In as an influence or expressed admiration for them are …And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Thursday, Billy Talent, Biffy Clyro, Underoath, Will Swan of Dance Gavin Dance, Nick Hipa of As I Lay Dying, The Fall of Troy, Jamie Lenman, Rolo Tomassi, La Dispute, Mutiny on the Bounty, sleepmakeswaves, Jarvis Cocker, Night Verses, and St Vincent.

<text>Relationship of Command is the third studio album by American post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, released on September 12, 2000. The album combines an aggressive edge with a melodic drive, harmonious, emotive vocals, and surreal lyrics. While it continues in the alternative style of At the Drive-In&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; is seen as a more well-rounded album than its predecessors. Initially received positively by critics, the album is now seen not only as one of the most influential post-hardcore albums of the 2000s, but also as one of the most accomplished recent works in the wider rock spectrum. &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; was voted twelfth out of 100 in the Albums of the Decade by &quot;NME&quot;, and the 37th most influential album of all time by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s final album to feature founding guitarist Jim Ward.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Relationship of Command&quot; was recorded over a seven-week period starting on January 17, 2000, following a tour supporting Rage Against the Machine. The album was recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California, and was produced by Ross Robinson and mixed by Andy Wallace. Known for his unorthodox production methods, Robinson at one point took bass player Paul Hinojos for a drive in his SUV through the hills of Malibu to get his adrenaline going prior to recording. He also brought Iggy Pop to the studio for a guest appearance; Omar Rodriguez commented: &quot;[Ross] had been talking to Iggy because they were gonna work together. I don&#x27;t know if they ever did, but they&#x27;d sort of been chatting, so Ross had passed him our previous records and he liked them. So, of course I brought up the idea, &quot;Why not [have Iggy] come and do something on the album?&quot; Ross mentioned it to Iggy, and he was completely open to it. He came down to the studio for a whole day in which he sang [on &quot;Rolodex Propaganda&quot;] and did the ransom note [on &quot;Enfilade&quot;].&quot;

In 2010, Rodriguez stated that he felt the album was “ruined by the mix”, calling it “plastic” and said he did not feel it captured the band’s true energy. 

The album&#x27;s cover artwork (including the covers for the singles &quot;One Armed Scissor,&quot; &quot;Invalid Litter Dept.&quot; and &quot;Rolodex Propaganda&quot;), illustrated by Damon Locks, all revolve around imagery of the Trojan War, and the Trojan Horse in particular.

==Release==
In March 2000, the band embarked on a five-week tour of Europe, two of which were spent with Sunshine. Following this, the band played a few shows in Japan in May, with Eastern Youth. They returned to the US, in time for a July tour. &quot;One Armed Scissor&quot; was released as a single in August 2000. &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; was released on September 12, 2000. In March 2001, the band went on indefinite hiatus.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The album initially received generally positive reviews, with Metacritic giving the album an aggregate score of 77. The album is now seen as one of the most influential rock albums of the decade, with it being ranked 47th in the 50 Greatest Albums of the 21st century in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, number 83 on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Albums 1985–2005, 6th in &quot;State&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 albums of the decade, 3rd in JustPressPlay&#x27;s Top 100 Albums of the 2000s, 52nd in &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine&#x27;s Greatest 100 albums of the decade, 117th in &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine&#x27;s 150 Albums of the decade, as well as being ranked at number 90 on MTV2&#x27;s greatest albums ever list. A retrospective BBC music review hailed the significance of Relationship of Command&#x27;s uniqueness, calling the album &quot;mesmerising&quot; and a &quot;statement of grand intent that could never be followed.&quot;

In 2005, the album was ranked number 423 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album is also seen as an influential guitar album, being ranked number 94 in a Guitar World reader&#x27;s poll of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time. This list appeared in the October 2006 issue of Guitar World.

===Legacy===
Following the release of the album, At the Drive-In gained brief mainstream critical and commercial success, with &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; appearing in end-of-year lists of the best albums of 2000 by publications such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, as well as becoming their first album to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band also made appearances on shows such as &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. However, despite this success, the band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2001, with the members splitting to form The Mars Volta and Sparta.

The album was included in &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s 101 Modern Classics list at number 4. The album was ranked at number 177 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)&quot; list. In 2019, the album was ranked 42nd on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list. In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine. Journalists Leslie Simon and Trevor Kelley included the album in their list of the most essential emo releases in their book &quot;Everybody Hurts: An Essential Guide to Emo Culture&quot; (2007). &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;One Armed Scissor&quot; at number one on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

<text>Sparta is an American rock band from El Paso, Texas, formed in 2001. The band currently consists of Jim Ward (vocals, guitar) and Matt Miller (bass), who are touring as a three-piece with rotating session drummers. Founding members Ward, Paul Hinojos, and Tony Hajjar were members of post-hardcore group At the Drive-In, forming Sparta in 2001 after the break-up of their former band. The band went on hiatus in 2008 for Ward to focus on his solo career and side projects, reuniting from 2011 to 2013 for a series of shows and permanently reuniting in 2017. The band has released five studio albums to date; their fourth, &quot;Trust the River&quot;, was released in 2020 after a 14-year break between releases.

Sparta&#x27;s music has been described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as &quot;anxious, epic guitar rock&quot;, and by &quot;SPIN Magazine&quot; as having &quot;a reliably cathartic and emotionally charged presence&quot;.

==History==

===&quot;Austere&quot; (2001–2002)===
After the demise of their previous band, At the Drive-In, drummer Tony Hajjar and bassist Paul Hinojos talked about forming a new band. Hinojos contacted former At the Drive-In guitarist and back-up vocalist Jim Ward to take the role of lead vocalist. After a brief stint with Erick Sanger, the three recruited Matt Miller, a native to El Paso and then bassist of the band Belknap to permanently fill the position of bassist, with Hinojos switching to guitar. The band then scored a deal with Dreamworks in 2001. The band released their first EP, entitled &quot;Austere&quot;, in early 2002 under the name Sparta. The EP met with mixed reviews, with most believing that the group had talent and the ability, but had yet to find their voice.

===&quot;Wiretap Scars&quot; and &quot;Live at La Zona Rosa&quot; (2002–2004)===
In August 2002, Sparta released their debut full-length album, &quot;Wiretap Scars&quot;. The album, although not well received by all of the mainstream post-hardcore audience, brought well-earned respect and relieved some of the pressure brought on by the shadow of At The Drive-In. The record was deemed a cleaner, more accessible sound than ATDI&#x27;s distortion-fueled offerings. True to their roots, the opening song, &quot;Cut Your Ribbon&quot;, was described as &quot;splintering, power-hungry rock&quot;, and other tracks such as &quot;Cataract&quot;, &quot;Glasshouse Tarot&quot; and &quot;Mye&quot; were noted for their emotion and &quot;absurdly exuberant melody&quot;. Sparta maintained its underground following with shows at smaller venues throughout North America and Europe. They were also exposed to a wider audience in April and May 2003, opening several shows for Pearl Jam. While on tour for &quot;Wiretap Scars&quot;, Sparta employed the help of their friend Gabriel Gonzalez to play third guitar and keyboards; he can be seen in the music videos from 2003&#x27;s Big Day Out festival, among other videos circulating online. Gonzalez now performs with his own band, Volador, and is a member of Ward&#x27;s side project Sleepercar. Gonzalez rejoined Sparta in 2017. On May 25, 2003, Ward&#x27;s cousin, Jeremy, died of a heroin overdose. Jeremy was at the time the sound manipulator for The Mars Volta, created by former At the Drive-In bandmates Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodríguez-López, and frontman of De Facto. The loss of his cousin would have a profound and lasting impact on Ward.

The band resumed writing new material, and on March 19, 2004 recorded a live album at La Zona Rosa. The album had seven tracks and six songs, including two previously unrecorded tracks: &quot;Lines in Sand&quot; and &quot;La Cerca&quot;. The album captured some of the live performance experience, but was not sold in stores and only available as a promotional CD. Videos for the songs &quot;Cut Your Ribbon&quot;, &quot;Mye&quot;, and &quot;La Cerca&quot; can be found online, recorded by the music television station Fuse TV.

===&quot;Porcelain&quot; and line-up changes (2004–2006)===

In July 2004, the band released their second album, &quot;Porcelain&quot;. Despite popular belief, none of the tracks are fueled by the loss of Jeremy Ward (Jim&#x27;s cousin and sound manipulator for the Mars Volta). Tracks such as &quot;Death in the Family&quot; and &quot;Travel by Bloodline&quot; stem from other personal losses, such as Jim Ward&#x27;s grandfather and a close friend. In a 2004 issue of the magazine Alternative Press, Ward describes his feelings towards these events, and how they have affected him. &quot;...he will admit that he hasn&#x27;t yet made sense of it, and, perhaps for that reason, there isn&#x27;t a song on &quot;Porcelain&quot; about Jeremy. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever make peace with that,&quot; he says. Immediately prior to the release, Sparta toured as the opening act for Incubus, after which followed their own headlining tour.

In 2005, after pulling the band off the road mid-tour, Ward said he needed to re-group. &quot;I walked out in the middle of a tour... I needed to get away from everything and everyone. I wasn&#x27;t enjoying myself at all, and I didn&#x27;t feel my life or the band was where I wanted it to be... I needed to step back and reassess everything.&quot; For two months, he retreated to his home without speaking to anyone in his professional life. In an article with PE.com, Ward said, &quot;When I left, I honestly didn&#x27;t know if I was going to continue the band or not, so I told everyone to pursue whatever they wanted,&quot;. During that time, Hinojos left to join The Mars Volta as their new secondary guitarist and sound manipulator, filling the void left by Jeremy Ward&#x27;s death. Hinojos was replaced by Keeley Davis.

Eventually, Ward went to visit Hajjar in Los Angeles. They began writing new material without the restrictions of a deadline, and soon Ward had rekindled his desire to perform. In January 2006, the band announced that they had signed a deal with Hollywood Records, and announced their intention to release a short film, titled &quot;Eme Nakia&quot;, based on Hajjar&#x27;s experiences as a child in Beirut, Lebanon.

===&quot;Threes&quot; and &quot;Eme Nakia&quot; (2006–2008)===
On March 9, 2006, by way of their official website, Sparta announced a new album, entitled &quot;Threes&quot;. Two days before the release, the entire album was available for streaming on their MySpace page. The album was released on October 24, 2006. Their first single off the album was &quot;Taking Back Control&quot;, and &quot;Erase It Again&quot; was released as the second single in mid-2007.

Davis&#x27; first show with the band was at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, in July 2006. However, the band looked at the show as a &quot;warm-up&quot; and the show at Los Angeles&#x27; Troubadour, July 29, 2006, was referred to as their &quot;first show to the public in 15 months&quot; by Ward. They played three songs off the upcoming album: &quot;Crawl&quot;, &quot;Weather The Storm&quot;, and the single &quot;Taking Back Control&quot;. At this show Ward also told the crowd about what happened when he left the band the previous year, saying he would rather have the crowd hear it from him, than the press in the following months. Sparta played at Chicago&#x27;s Lollapalooza festival the following week. The band toured the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe heavily after the release of the album with bands such as Lola Ray, Aloha, As Tall As Lions, Sound Team, Moneen, MeWithoutYou, Lovedrug, Straylight Run, Deftones and My Chemical Romance. On February 19, 2007, the band played a free concert with Lydia Vance in Las Vegas for the XPOZ Coalition, an anti-smoking organization. While touring with Straylight Run and Lovedrug, Sparta allowed Lovedrug to continue touring by letting them use their instruments and equipment after Lovedrug&#x27;s gear was stolen following a show in Detroit, Michigan.

In conjunction with the album &quot;Threes&quot;, Sparta also released a 16-minute film entitled &quot;Eme Nakia&quot;. The film, the soundtrack for which is performed by Sparta, is about drummer Hajjar&#x27;s early life, set during the Lebanese civil war of 1975–1990. Hajjar fled at the age of five to the United States, settling in the sprawling west Texas border town of El Paso. When Hajjar was 14, his mother (&quot;Eme&quot;) died after a bout with cancer and his father, who had been distant, left the family. His brother, 18 years old at the time, assumed responsibility for the family and raised Hajjar and his sister. The film follows Hajjar&#x27;s early life story, showing his challenges and ending with him in present day. The independent film received good reviews and is available for free with purchase of the &quot;Threes&quot; album. The word &quot;Eme&quot; is Arabic for mother, and &quot;Nakia&quot; was Hajjar&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name.

===Hiatus (2008–2011)===
In June 2008, Ward stated that Sparta is &quot;currently on hiatus and label-less&quot;, and that he will be focusing on his project Sleepercar. In January 2009, when asked if a return to Sparta was foreseeable, Ward stated that he has no plans to reunite with his bandmates: &quot;I don&#x27;t right now, no. Who knows what the future will bring?&quot;
In July 2010, sleepercarmusic.com stated that &quot;Sparta is not broken up, Sparta is taking a nap.&quot;

===First return (2011-2013)===
Following a three-year &quot;nap&quot;, Sparta played their first show since 2008 in November 2011 in their hometown of El Paso, Texas. They performed on November 17 and 18 at Tricky Falls, the newly renovated venue co-owned by frontman Jim Ward. The band headed into the studio that fall to begin work on their fourth LP, the follow-up to 2006&#x27;s &quot;Threes&quot;. A short tour of the southwestern US followed in May 2012.

Sparta released a new song on May 17, 2012 called &quot;Chemical Feel&quot;. The song was free to download, and was the first new song the band had released in six years.
In January 2012, At The Drive-In reunited for a series of shows, splitting up once again at the end of the year. In January 2016, At The Drive-In reunited for the second time. However, days before the tour start in March 2016, it was announced that Ward had been replaced in the band by his former Sparta bandmate Keeley Davis.

===Second return, line-up changes, &quot;Trust the River&quot; and &quot;Sparta&quot; (2017–present)===

On November 13, 2017 a new line-up was announced, consisting of returning members Ward, Matt Miller and Gabriel Gonzalez, along with former Cursive drummer Cully Symington. A new song, &quot;Graveyard Luck,&quot; was released on the same day. Another song, &quot;Cat Scream&quot;, was released in April 2018 together with a tour announcement. The band played in several North American cities throughout the rest of 2018.

The band announced the release of the single &quot;Believe&quot; on January 23, 2020, through their Instagram account – along with a new music video and a date for their new album, &quot;Trust The River&quot;, which was released on April 10, 2020. The band also shared information on a US tour to start in San Francisco on April 23, 2020 – though this was ultimately cancelled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Gonzalez and Symington exited the band in 2021 and were not replaced, converting Sparta into the duo of Ward and Miller. Sparta played their first live shows in over two years at Ward&#x27;s own restaurant, Eloise, in El Paso across two nights on March 18 and 19, 2022. They later announced a North American tour in support of The Get Up Kids.

In August 2022, Sparta announced their fifth studio album – a self-titled release, which marked the band&#x27;s first as a duo. Ward and Miller made the album with assistance from members of Thursday and musician Kayleigh Goldsworthy. The band also shared two singles from the album to coincide with the announcement: &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; and &quot;Spiders&quot;. &quot;Sparta&quot; was released on October 14, 2022, via Dine Alone.

<doc id="280494" wikidata="Q2613325" url="?curid=280494" title="Eyre Coote (East India Company officer)">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote, KB ( – 28 April 1783) was an Anglo-Irish army officer and politician who represented Leicester and Poole in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1768 to 1780. He is best known for his many years of service with the Bengal Army in India, where his victory at the Battle of Wandiwash was considered a decisive turning point in the struggle for control over the region between Britain and France. Coote was known by his sepoy troops as Coote Bahadur (Coote the Brave).

==Early life==

A member of the Coote family headed by the Earl of Mountrath, he was born in Kilmallock, near Limerick, Ireland, the son of the Reverend Chidley Coote and Jane Evans, daughter of George Evans, and sister of George Evans, 1st Baron Carbery. He entered the 27th Regiment of Foot. He first saw active service in the Jacobite rising of 1745, and later obtained a captaincy in the 39th Regiment, the first regular British regiment to serve in India.

==Career in India==

===Recapture of Calcutta===

In 1756 a part of the regiment, then quartered at Madras, was sent forward to join Robert Clive in his operations against Calcutta which had recently been captured by the forces of the Nawab of Bengal, which had been followed by the Black Hole of Calcutta. The city was reoccupied without difficulty in January 1757. However, Coote and Clive argued so violently over who should reoccupy Fort William that they almost fired at each other, which began a lifelong rivalry and hatred between the two men.

===Plassey===

Coote was soon given the local rank of major for his good conduct in surprising the camp of the Nawab of Bengal. Soon afterwards came the Battle of Plassey, which would probably never have taken place but for Coote&#x27;s advice at the council of war; after the defeat of the Nawab he led a detachment in pursuit of the French for 400 miles under extraordinary difficulties. His conduct won him the rank of lieutenant-colonel and the command of the 84th Regiment of Foot, newly raised in Britain for Indian service, but his exertions had seriously damaged his health.

===Wandiwash===

In October 1759 Coote&#x27;s regiment arrived to take part in the decisive struggle between French and British in the Carnatic. He took command of the forces at Madras, where a French siege had recently been defeated, and on 22 January 1760 led them in the decisive victory of Wandiwash.

After a time the remnants of Lally&#x27;s forces were besieged in Pondicherry. For some reason Coote was not entrusted with the siege operations, but loyally supported William Monson, who brought the siege to a successful end on 15 January 1761. In the latter year he sat for Maryborough in the Irish House of Commons.

Soon afterwards Coote was given the command of the British East India Company&#x27;s forces in Bengal, and settled a serious dispute between the Nawab Mir Qasim and a powerful subordinate.

==Member of Parliament==

In 1762, he returned to Britain, receiving a jewelled sword of honour from the company and other rewards for his great services. In 1771 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Bath. In 1768, he was elected M.P. for the borough of Leicester in the Parliament of Great Britain, before transferring to Poole, nearer his Hampshire estates, in 1774. He relinquished the seat in 1780 after his last return to India.

==Return to India==

In 1779 he sailed on to India to assume the role of commander in chief of the company forces in India. He allied himself to Warren Hastings, the Governor-General who generally deferred to him and gave him a free hand over military matters, in opposition to Hasting&#x27;s opponents on the ruling Council Edward Wheler and Philip Francis. He spent much of his time visiting outlying garrisons and chose to attend meetings of the Calcutta Council only when it was necessary to pass some important measure. Without Coote&#x27;s support, Hastings was likely to be outvoted on the council. This situation only ended when Francis returned home where he began to stir up criticism of Hastings&#x27; conduct which ultimately led to his failed impeachment.

===Second Anglo-Mysore War===

Following Hyder Ali&#x27;s opening of the Second Anglo-Mysore War in southern India, Coote returned to active service. It was not until 1 June 1781 that Coote struck the first heavy blow against Hyder in the decisive Battle of Porto Novo. The battle was won by Coote against odds of five to one. It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur (the scene of an earlier triumph of Hyder over a British force) on 27 August, in which the British won another success, and by the rout of the Mysore troops at Sholinghur a month later. His last service was the arduous campaign of 1782, which finally shattered a constitution already gravely impaired by hardship and exertions.

==Death==

In 1782, Coote relinquished his command, and moved to Calcutta. However amid increasing French harassment, and ruptures between the governor and new commander in chief, Hastings persuaded Coote to return to his command. He died of a stroke soon after returning to Madras on 28 April 1783. His body was brought back to England and buried in the parish church of Rockbourne in Hampshire, the location of his estate.

===Legacy===

Coote is generally remembered for his victory at Wandiwash and capture of Pondicherry which were decisive moments in the struggle between Britain and France for dominance in India. Although he often quarrelled with other British officers and officials, Coote was adored by the sepoy troops under his command. Following his death a monument was erected to him in Westminster Abbey and another, in the form of a tall column, within his estate at West Park, Rockbourne, Hampshire. His nephew was Eyre Coote who served as Governor General of India.

He had married in 1769 a daughter of Charles Hutchinson, Governor of St. Helena. They had no children, and his property, worth over £200,000, was left to his brother, Doctor Charles Coote, Dean of Kilfenora, in County Clare, Ireland. In his autobiography the American General and Secretary of State Colin Powell claims direct descent from Coote&#x27;s identically named nephew Eyre Coote while the latter was serving as Governor of Jamaica, which has led to Powell sometimes being incorrectly referred to as a direct descendant of the elder General Coote.

<text>The lumbar vertebrae are located between the thoracic vertebrae and pelvis. They form the lower part of the back in humans, and the tail end of the back in quadrupeds. In humans, there are five lumbar vertebrae. The term is used to describe the anatomy of humans and quadrupeds, such as horses, pigs, or cattle. These bones are found in particular cuts of meat, including tenderloin or sirloin steak.

==Human anatomy==
In human anatomy, the five vertebrae are between the rib cage and the pelvis. They are the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body (as found only in the thoracic region). They are designated L1 to L5, starting at the top. The lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the body, and permit movement.

=== General characteristics ===

The adjacent figure depicts the general characteristics of the first through fourth lumbar vertebrae. The fifth vertebra contains certain peculiarities, which are detailed below.

As with other vertebrae, each lumbar vertebra consists of a &quot;vertebral body&quot; and a &quot;vertebral arch&quot;. The vertebral arch, consisting of a pair of &quot;pedicles&quot; and a pair of &quot;laminae&quot;, encloses the &quot;vertebral foramen&quot; (opening) and supports seven processes.

==== Body ====
The vertebral body of each lumbar vertebra is kidney shaped, wider from side to side than from front to back, and a little thicker in front than in back. It is flattened or slightly concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and at the sides.

==== Arch ====
The pedicles are very strong, directed backward from the upper part of the vertebral body; consequently, the inferior vertebral notches are of considerable depth. The pedicles change in morphology from the upper lumbar to the lower lumbar. They increase in sagittal width from 9 mm to up to 18 mm at L5. They increase in angulation in the axial plane from 10 degrees to 20 degrees by L5. The pedicle is sometimes used as a portal of entrance into the vertebral body for fixation with pedicle screws or for placement of bone cement as with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty.

The laminae are broad, short, and strong. They form the posterior portion of the vertebral arch. In the upper lumbar region the lamina are taller than wide, but in the lower lumbar vertebra the lamina are wider than tall. The lamina connects the spinous process to the pedicles.

The vertebral foramen within the arch is triangular, larger than the thoracic vertebrae, but smaller than in the cervical vertebrae.

==== Processes ====
The spinous process is thick, broad, and somewhat quadrilateral; it projects backward and ends in a rough, uneven border, thickest below where it is occasionally notched.

The superior and inferior articular processes are well-defined, projecting respectively upward and downward from the junctions of pedicles and laminae. The facets on the superior processes are concave, and look backward and medialward; those on the inferior are convex, and are directed forward and lateralward. The former are wider apart than the latter since in the articulated column, the inferior articular processes are embraced by the superior processes of the subjacent vertebra.

The transverse processes are long and slender. They are horizontal in the upper three lumbar vertebrae and incline a little upward in the lower two. In the upper three vertebrae they arise from the junctions of the pedicles and laminae, but in the lower two they are set further forward and spring from the pedicles and posterior parts of the vertebral bodies. They are situated in front of the articular processes instead of behind them as in the thoracic vertebrae, and are homologous with the ribs.

Three portions or &quot;tubercles&quot; can be noticed in a transverse process of a lower lumbar vertebrae: the lateral or costiform process, the mammillary process, and the accessory process. The costiform is lateral, the mammillary is superior (cranial), and the accessory is inferior (caudal). The mammillary is connected in the lumbar region with the back part of the superior articular process. The accessory process is situated at the back part of the base of the transverse process. The tallest and thickest costiform process is usually that of L5.

=== First and fifth lumbar vertebrae ===
The first lumbar vertebra is level with the anterior end of the ninth rib. This level is also called the important transpyloric plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level. Other important structures are also located at this level. They include fundus of the gall bladder, celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, termination of spinal cord, beginning of filum terminale, renal vessels, middle suprarenal arteries, and hila of kidneys.

The fifth lumbar vertebra is characterized by its body being much deeper in front than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacrovertebral articulation; by the smaller size of its spinous process; by the wide interval between the inferior articular processes, and by the thickness of its transverse processes, which spring from the body as well as from the pedicles.
The fifth lumbar vertebra is by far the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.

Most individuals have five lumbar vertebrae, while some have four or six. Lumbar disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these latter individuals.

=== Segmental movements ===
The range of segmental movements in a single segment is difficult to measure clinically, not only because of variations between individuals, but also because it is age and sex dependent. Furthermore, flexion and extension in the lumbal spine is the product of a combination of rotation and translation in the sagittal plane between each vertebra.

Ranges of segmental movements in the lumbar spine (White and Punjabi, 1990) are (in degrees):

===Congenital anomalies===

Congenital vertebral anomalies can cause compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.

==Other apes==
African apes have three and four lumbar vertebrae, (bonobos have longer spines with an additional vertebra) and humans normally five. This difference, and because the lumbar spines of the extinct &quot;Nacholapithecus&quot; (a Miocene hominoid with six lumbar vertebrae and no tail) are similar to those of early &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and early &quot;Homo&quot;, it is assumed that the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor also had a long vertebral column with a long lumbar region and the reduction in the number of lumbar vertebrae evolved independently in each ape clade.
The limited number of lumbar vertebrae in chimpanzees and gorillas result in an inability to lordose (curve) their lumbar spines, in contrast to the spines of Old World monkeys and &quot;Nacholapithecus&quot; and &quot;Proconsul&quot;, which suggests that the last common ancestor was not &quot;short-backed&quot; as previously believed.

<doc id="280500" wikidata="Q584660" url="?curid=280500" title="Palden Thondup Namgyal">
<text>Palden Thondup Namgyal (Sikkimese: ; Wylie: &quot;dpal-ldan don-grub rnam-rgyal&quot;; 23 May 1923 – 29 January 1982) was the 12th and last Chogyal (king) of the Kingdom of Sikkim.

==Biography==
Palden thondup Namgyal was born on 23 May 1923 at the Royal Palace, Park Ridge, Gangtok.

At six, he became a student at St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent in Kalimpong, but had to terminate his studies due to attacks of malaria. From age eight to eleven he studied under his uncle, Rimpoche Lhatsun, in order to be ordained a Buddhist monk; he was subsequently recognised as the reincarnated leader of both Phodong and Rumtek monasteries. He later continued his studies at St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Darjeeling and finally graduated from Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, in 1941. His plans to study science at Cambridge were dashed when his elder brother, the crown prince, a member of the Indian Air Force was killed in a plane crash in 1941. He underwent training for Indian Civil Service at Dehradun I.C.S. Camp. 

Namgyal served as adviser for internal affairs for his father, Sir Tashi Namgyal, the 11th Chogyal, and led the negotiating team which established Sikkim&#x27;s relationship to India after independence in 1949. He married Samyo Kushoe Sangideki in 1950, a daughter of an important Tibetan family of Lhasa, and together they had two sons and a daughter. Samyo Kushoe Sangideki died in 1957.

In 1963, Namgyal married Hope Cooke, a 22-year-old American socialite from New York City; she was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers in the state of New York. The marriage brought worldwide media attention to Sikkim. The couple, who had two children, divorced in 1980.

Shortly after Namgyal&#x27;s marriage, his father died and he was crowned the new Chogyal on an astrologically favourable date in 1965. In 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. 

In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal&#x27;s palace guards. A referendum on abolishing the monarchy was held in the Kingdom of Sikkim on 14 April 1975 and the people of Sikkim voted 59,637 to 1,496 for Indian statehood and the ouster of their Chogyal, or ruler, Palden Thondup Namgyal, who was under Indian army guard in his palace in Gangtok.

In November 1976, Namgyal allegedly attempted suicide by consuming barbiturates and was airlifted to IPGMER and SSKM Hospital. He was successfully treated by Professor Dr. Amal Kumar Bose, Head of the Department of Anesthesia and Respiratory Care Unit at the SSKM hospital.

Namgyal died of cancer at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, United States on 29 January 1982. He was 58 years old at the time of his death. Upon his death, 31 members of the State Legislative Assembly offered &quot;khadas&quot; to the Chogyal as a mark of respect.

===Other interests===
Namgyal was an amateur radio operator, call-sign AC3PT, and was a highly sought after contact on the airwaves. The international callbook listed his address as: P.T. Namgyal, The Palace, Gangtok, Sikkim.

He financed the documentary &quot;Sikkim&quot; (1971) by Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray.

==Legacy==

Namgyal shaped a &quot;model Asian state&quot; where the literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as neighbours Nepal, Bhutan and India.

His first son, the former crown prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, died in 1978 in a car accident. His second son from his first marriage, Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal, was named the 13th Chogyal, but the position no longer confers any official authority.

His son from his second marriage, Palden Gyurmed Namgyal, moved to New York aged nine with his mother and sister, being educated at Dalton School. He would go on to work for JPMorgan Chase, becoming a managing director. He was dismissed in 2003 following an incident of sexual harassment against a colleague.

<doc id="280502" wikidata="Q13582217" url="?curid=280502" title="Vote pairing">
<text>Vote swapping, also called co-voting or vote pairing or vote trading, is an informal strategic agreement between two voters to &quot;exchange&quot; their votes, in order to vote tactically and maximize the chances that their preferred candidates will win election. Vote swapping avoids wasted votes (and the &quot;spoiler effect&quot;) by shifting votes from uncompetitive districts to competitive districts.

In a vote swapping agreement, Voter 1 in District A commits to vote for Voter 2&#x27;s preferred candidate in District A, and Voter 2 in District B commits to vote for Voter 1&#x27;s preferred candidate in District B.

For example, consider elections in the United Kingdom: In constituency A, the race is tight between a Labour and a Conservative candidate. In constituency B, the race is tight between a Liberal Democrat and a Conservative candidate. A Liberal Democrat voter in constituency A would agree to vote Labour, and in exchange, a Labour voter in constituency B would agree to vote Liberal Democrat. This makes it more likely for either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to win that seat from the Conservatives.

In the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, the process has been subjected to legal challenge and been deemed legal.

== Legality ==

=== Canada ===
In Canada, vote swapping with other people in Canada is legal per the Elections Act, as long as there is no money or &quot;material benefit&quot; that passes hands in the vote swap agreement. It&#x27;s also illegal to trick someone using a false identity to influence someone to vote in a different way.

=== United States ===
In the United States, it is illegal to buy or sell votes. In the 2000 presidential election, graduate students created a satirical web site for buying and selling votes, vote-auction.com, which was shut down by an Illinois judge.

Opponents of vote swapping claim that it is illegal to give or accept anything that has pecuniary value in exchange for a vote. Proponents for vote pairing respond that vote pairing does not involve any pecuniary or monetary exchange. Instead, vote swapping is simply an informal, nonbinding agreement between people to vote strategically. In addition, vote pairing is a routine practice in legislative bodies, such as Congress and city councils.

The debate regarding the legality of vote pairing peaked during the 2000 presidential election, when there was a strong effort to shut down the U.S. vote-pairing websites. On October 30, 2000, eight days before the November 2000 United States presidential elections, California Secretary of State Bill Jones threatened to prosecute voteswap2000.com, a California-based vote pairing website. In response, voteswap2000.com and votexchange2000.com immediately shut their virtual doors. The site operators, Alan Porter (votexchange2000.com) and William Cody (voteswap2000.com), and two potential users of the sites, Patrick Kerr and Steven Lewis, took the state of California to court. The district court was slow to respond and abstained from making any decision. In 2003, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this abstention.

On August 6, 2007, the 9th Circuit ruled that California&#x27;s threats violated the First Amendment, writing:

The 9th Circuit did not decide whether the threats violated the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause.

As of 2024, vote swapping remains legal, so long as no money or gifts are exchanged.

== History ==

=== Canada ===
Canadian voters extensively use strategic voting and strategic voting pledges. For example, during the 2015 federal election, strategic voting was used extensively against the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, which had benefited from vote splitting among centrist and left-leaning parties in the 2011 election. Following the landslide victory of the Liberals led by Justin Trudeau over Harper&#x27;s Conservatives, experts argued that this dramatic increase in support for the Liberals at the expense of the NDP and Green Party was partially due to strategic voting for Liberal candidates. In three weeks, 1.4 million voters switched from NDP to Liberal. In at least two closely-contested ridings, strategic voting websites obtained enough pledges to account for the victory margin of the Liberal candidate.

Vote swapping websites can also help voters switch votes from district to district, such as VotePair.ca (also PairVote.ca), created by Gerry Kirk. In the 2008 Canadian federal election, VotePair.ca claimed that 6,000 people registered to swap their vote and 2,800 successful vote swaps occurred. In the 2011 Canadian federal election, VotePair.ca claimed that 5,741 people had registered 1 week before the election, that 7,522 people registered in total, and that 1,713 swaps (for 3,426 votes) officially occurred, of which 838 were swapped into Greens, 1367 into NDP, and 1488 into Liberals.

=== United States ===

Since 2000, voters have used vote swapping as a tactical voting strategy in U.S. presidential elections. In this practice, a third-party voter from a swing state reaches an agreement with a Democratic or Republican voter from a red state or blue state (or &quot;safe state&quot;). Under this agreement, the third-party voter pledges to support the other&#x27;s major party candidate, and in exchange, the Dem/Rep voter pledges to support the other&#x27;s minor party candidate. For example, a Green voter in Wisconsin might swap with a Democratic voter in California.

Under the United States Electoral College, all of a state&#x27;s votes go to the winning presidential candidate for that state, no matter how close the margin, in a winner-take-all system. Third-party candidates for president frequently garner no Electoral College votes, but can siphon off total votes from the front runners in order to call attention to their causes. Vote-swapping agreements allow third-party candidates to get of the popular vote, while the major-party candidate gets more of the Electoral College vote.

==== 2000 United States presidential election ====

The debate over the legality of vote swapping intensified in the final days of the 2000 election when six Republican state secretaries of state, led by the California Secretary of State Bill Jones, charged that vote-pairing web sites were illegal and threatened criminal charges against their creators. Multiple web sites had sprung up that were matching supporters of the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore, in non-swing states, with supporters in swing states of the strongest third-party candidate, Ralph Nader. Some argued that Ralph Nader was drawing support from left leaning Democrats that would otherwise vote for Al Gore. This would have allowed Nader to get more of the popular vote, or at least his fair share of it, and at the same time allowed Gore to perhaps get more of the Electoral College vote.

There are multiple reasons it would be important for Ralph Nader to still get his share of the national popular vote. One is that if he got five percent or more, then he could get federally distributed public funding in the next election. Also, and perhaps more importantly, he could possibly get included in the presidential debates for the next election in 2004. Third parties have protested their exclusion from the presidential debates.

In 2000, many of the vote pairing web sites were hosted in California, and so when the California Secretary of State, Bill Jones, charged that the web sites were illegal and threatened their creators with criminal prosecution, some (but not all) of the sites reluctantly shut down. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) got involved to protect the web sites, seeking a restraining order against Jones and then a permanent injunction against him, alleging that he had violated the constitutional rights of the web site creators. However, the issue would only be resolved after the 2000 election had already occurred.

It is possible that Jones&#x27;s threats, which shut down several vote-swapping websites, changed the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. After the election, votetrader.org tallied up the total number of voter swaps across all vote-swapping websites at 16,024, of which 1,412 were Nader-to-Gore voters in Florida. Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris certified George W. Bush as winning Florida by just 537 votes, and certified Ralph Nader as winning 97,421 votes. Under this standard, if another 550 voters had swapped (about 0.5% of Nader&#x27;s total), then Gore would have won. In their ruling on December 8, 2004, the Florida Supreme Court changed this margin to just 193 votes. Under this standard, if another 200 voters had swapped (about 0.2% of Nader&#x27;s total), then Gore would have won. Put another way: If about 1,600 Nader supporters had vote paired instead of 1,400, Gore would have carried the election.

There were numerous other controversies in Florida&#x27;s vote count: from the Palm Beach County butterfly ballots; to the question of whether Bush would have still won the state in a full recount; to how Katherine Harris, a Republican, was the co-chair of the Bush campaign in Florida at the same time she was the Florida state secretary of state. Notably, the California state secretary of state, Bill Jones, who charged that the vote-pairing web sites were illegal, was also a Republican supporter of George W. Bush. The federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would eventually rule against him, but this decision did not come down until February 6, 2003, long after the 2000 election was already over. In the next presidential election, in 2004, the legality of the vote-pairing web sites went unquestioned. Indeed, the California state secretary of state for the 2004 election (a successor to Bill Jones) publicly announced, before that election, that vote pairing was legal.

==== 2016 United States presidential election ====

In 2016, four substantial vote swapping campaigns appeared. Two of these campaigns hoped to swap votes from Clinton supporters in safe states with supporters of third parties, such as NeverTrump Republican voters:

* The #NeverTrump app, created by Amit Kumar, sought to exchange votes between Clinton voters in safe states and third-party voters in swing states, in order to prevent Donald Trump from being elected. Kumar claimed that 16,000 people had signed up to trade. On November 8, the #NeverTrump app listed 10,568 &quot;active traders&quot;, including about 550 people in Florida, 600 in Pennsylvania, and 250 in North Carolina.
* TrumpTraders.org, created by Republicans for Clinton in 2016 (R4C16), sought to exchange votes between Clinton voters in safe states and third-party voters in swing states, in order to prevent Donald Trump from being elected. TrumpTraders.org claimed that, by October 31, more than 10,000 voters had signed up. In November, TrumpTraders.org offered a 2:1 exchange rate, such that one third-party supporter could vote for Clinton, and in exchange, two Clinton supporters would vote for that third party. After the election, TrumpTraders.org claimed that over 45,000 voters had signed up, including 5,000 in Florida.

Two campaigns hoped to swap votes between one Democratic voter and one Republican voter, who would both agree to vote for a third party candidate such as Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or Green candidate Jill Stein:

* Balanced Rebellion, created by libertarian super PAC AlternativePAC, sought to pair one disgruntled Trump voter and one disgruntled Clinton voter, who would both agree to vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. On September 7, 2016, AlternativePAC leader Matt Kibbe claimed that 66,429 people had signed up (33,393 Democrats, 33,036 Republicans) and 61,638 people had successfully matched (in 30,819 matches).
* VotePact.org, created in 2000 by Sam Husseini, sought to pair one disgruntled Trump voter and one disgruntled Clinton voter, who would both agree to vote for a third party candidate of their choice. However, VotePact had no process for matching voters beyond providing a common Facebook page.

==== 2024 United States presidential election ====

In 2024, the SwapYourVote.org campaign paired 1 swing state voter (who would vote for Kamala Harris) with 2 safe state voters (who would vote for Jill Stein or another protest candidate). The vast majority of vote swappers were opposed to the United States support for Israel in the Israel–Hamas war. In its first 2 weeks, SwapYourVote.org had 2,300 sign-ups. After the election, SwapYourVote.org claimed that 15,356 voters had signed up to swap, which would yield about 5,120 votes for Harris and 10,210 votes for protest candidates.

SwapYourVote.org also argued in favor of ranked-choice voting, which would remove the need to swap votes.

== Criticisms ==
Because vote swapping agreements are informal, and because ballots are secret, vote swapping agreements are not enforceable. Therefore, unlike legal contracts, vote swapping is not legally binding, and one or both swappers could fail to uphold their agreement.

In 2016, Stein campaign co-chair Gloria Mattera criticized vote pairing schemes, stating that the campaign&#x27;s position on vote pairing is that it is a failed strategy because voting for the &quot;lesser evil&quot; had led highly distrusted major party candidates, and that Americans should instead vote for the candidate who best represents their interests.

Other criticisms of vote pairing consist of arguments against supporting third-parties in the first place. One criticism is that helping third parties could hurt the Democratic Party in future elections, because if a third party secures 5% of the total votes, they are entitled to federal funds, and can then siphon off more votes from the Democratic Party in future elections.

== Effectiveness ==
In 2016, Yale political science associate professor Alexander Coppock partnered with TrumpTraders.org to empirically test the effect of vote swapping. TrumpTraders randomly assigned 4500 third-party voters from swing states who signed up to either a control condition (not matched with a safe state voter) or a treatment condition (matched). Of control voters (not matched), 25% voted for Clinton regardless. Of treatment voters, 57% voted for Clinton, representing a 32 point (or 128%) increase. On this basis, Coppock argues that &quot;vote swapping programs may be an effective campaign tactic to persuade third party voters to vote for major party candidates&quot;.

== Comparison with other voting systems ==
Vote pairing is most often used as a strategy in first-past-the-post voting with winner-takes-all constituencies, as they provide the strongest incentives for dishonesty. However, such a strategy can be effective when using ranked-choice voting as well. Instant-runoff systems are particularly vulnerable to the practice because they frequently fail the favorite betrayal criterion, which means casting a first-rank vote for a third-party can cause a &quot;greater evil&quot; candidate to win.

For example, in the 2009 Burlington mayoral election, voters who supported moderate Republican Kurt Wright eliminated Democrat Andy Montroll in the second round, allowing socialist candidate Bob Kiss to win. If a similar instant-runoff system were adopted nationwide, Republicans in Vermont would have a strong incentive to swap votes with Democrats in districts where the Democrat was unlikely to win. A similar situation occurred in the 2022 Alaska special election.

Most rated voting systems (including approval voting and score voting) satisfy the favorite betrayal criterion, rendering vote-pairing fully unnecessary. Proportional representation systems also make the practice less important (although it can still occur if there are regionally-calculated electoral thresholds).

<doc id="280509" wikidata="Q634299" url="?curid=280509" title="Fire hydrant">
<text>A fire hydrant, fireplug, firecock (archaic), hydrant riser or Johnny Pump is a connection point by which firefighters can tap into a water supply. It is a component of active fire protection. Underground fire hydrants have been used in Europe and Asia since at least the 18th century. Above-ground pillar-type hydrants are a 19th-century invention.

==Operation==
The user (most likely a fire department) attaches a hose to the fire hydrant, then opens a valve on the hydrant to provide a powerful flow of water, on the order of ; this pressure varies according to region and depends on various factors (including the size and location of the attached water main). This user can attach this hose to a fire engine, which can use a powerful pump to boost the water pressure and possibly split it into multiple streams. One may connect the hose with a threaded connection, instantaneous &quot;quick connector&quot; or a Storz connector.

If a fire hydrant is opened or closed too quickly, a water hammer can occur and damage nearby pipes and equipment. The water inside a charged hose line causes it to be very heavy, and high-water pressure causes it to be stiff and unable to make a tight turn while pressurized. When a fire hydrant is unobstructed, this is not a problem, as there is enough room to adequately position the hose.

Most fire hydrant valves are not designed to throttle the water flow; they are designed to be operated full-on or full-off. The valving arrangement of most dry-barrel hydrants is for the drain valve to be open at anything other than full operation. Usage at partial opening can consequently result in considerable flow directly into the soil surrounding the hydrant, which, over time, can cause severe scouring. Gate or butterfly valves can be installed directly onto the hydrant opening to control individual outputs and allow for changing equipment connections without turning off the flow to other outlets. These valves can be up to in diameter to accommodate the large central &quot;steamer&quot; outlets on many US hydrants. It is good practice to install valves on all outlets before using a hydrant as the protective caps are unreliable and can cause major injury if they fail.

New firefighters are often trained extensively on fire hydrants in the fire academy to be quick and safe while connecting the fire engine to the fire hydrant (usually within one minute). Time is often critical as other firefighters will be waiting for the water supply. When operating a hydrant, a firefighter typically wears appropriate personal protective equipment, such as gloves and a helmet with face shield worn. High-pressure water coursing through a potentially aging and corroding hydrant could cause a failure, injuring the firefighter operating the hydrant or bystanders.

In most jurisdictions it is illegal to park a car within a certain distance of a fire hydrant. In North America, the distances are commonly , often indicated by yellow or red paint on the curb. The rationale behind these laws is that hydrants need to be visible and accessible in an emergency. In the event that a car is illegally parked next to a fire hydrant when firefighters need access to it, firefighters are legally allowed to break the car&#x27;s windows to run the hose through it, while the car owner receives a parking citation.

=== Other uses===

====Street pooling====

In 1896, during a terrible heatwave in New York City, the Commissioner of Public Works ordered the opening of the fire hydrants to provide relief to the population. Today some US communities provide low flow sprinkler heads to enable residents to use the hydrants to cool off during hot weather, while gaining some control on water usage. Sometimes those simply seeking to play in the water remove the caps and open the valve, providing residents a place to play and cool off in summer.

====Preventing misuse====
To prevent casual use or misuse, the hydrant requires special tools to be opened, usually a large wrench with a pentagonal socket. Vandals sometimes cause monetary loss by wasting water when they open hydrants. Such vandalism can also reduce municipal water pressure and impair firefighters&#x27; efforts to extinguish fires. Most fire hydrants in Australia are protected by a silver-coloured cover with a red top, secured to the ground with bolts to protect the hydrant from vandalism and unauthorized use. The cover must be removed before use.

In most areas of the United States, contractors who need temporary water may purchase permits to use hydrants. The permit will generally require a hydrant meter, a gate valve and sometimes a clapper valve (if not designed into the hydrant already) to prevent backflow into the hydrant. Additionally, residents who wish to use the hydrant to fill their in-ground swimming pool are commonly permitted to do so, provided they pay for the water and agree to allow firefighters to draft from their pool in the case of an emergency.

Municipal services, such as street sweepers and tank trucks, may also be allowed to use hydrants to fill their water tanks. Often sewer maintenance trucks need water to flush out sewerage lines and fill their tanks on site from a hydrant. If necessary, the municipal workers will record the amount of water they used or use a meter.

Fire hydrants may be used to supply water to riot control vehicles. These vehicles use a high-pressure water cannon to discourage rioting.

Since fire hydrants are one of the most accessible parts of a water distribution system, they are often used for attaching pressure gauges or loggers or monitor system water pressure. Automatic flushing devices are often attached to hydrants to maintain chlorination levels in areas of low usage. Hydrants are also used as an easy above-ground access point by leak detection devices to locate leaks from the sound they make.

==Construction==
Depending on the country or location, hydrants can be above or below ground. In countries including Japan, the UK, Ukraine, Russia or Spain hydrants are accessible under a heavy metal cover. In other countries, such as the US, and many parts of China, an accessible part of the hydrant is above ground. It can also be mounted in an exterior wall of a building.

In areas subject to freezing temperatures, at most only a portion of the hydrant is above ground. The valve is located below the frost line and connected by a to the above-ground portion. A valve rod extends from the valve up through a seal at the top of the hydrant, where it can be operated with the proper wrench. This design is known as a &quot;dry barrel&quot; hydrant, in that the barrel, or vertical body of the hydrant, is normally dry. A drain valve underground opens when the water valve is completely closed; this allows all water to drain from the hydrant body to prevent the hydrant from freezing.

In warm areas, above-ground hydrants may be used with one or more valves in the above-ground portion. Unlike with cold-weather hydrants, it is possible to turn the water supply on and off to each port. This style is known as a &quot;wet barrel&quot; hydrant.

Both wet- and dry-barrel hydrants typically have multiple outlets. Wet barrel hydrant outlets are typically individually controlled, while a single stem operates all the outlets of a dry barrel hydrant simultaneously. Thus, wet barrel hydrants allow single outlets to be opened, requiring somewhat more effort, but simultaneously allowing more flexibility.

A typical US dry-barrel hydrant has two smaller outlets and one larger outlet. The larger outlet is often a Storz connection if the local fire department has standardized on hose using Storz fittings for large diameter supply line. The larger outlet is known as a &quot;steamer&quot; connection, because they were once used to supply steam powered water pumps, and a hydrant with such an outlet may be called a &quot;steamer hydrant&quot;, although this usage is becoming archaic. Likewise, an older hydrant without a steamer connection may be called a &quot;village hydrant.&quot;

==Appearance==

Above ground hydrants are coloured for purely practical criteria or more aesthetic reasons. In the United States, the AWWA and NFPA recommend hydrants be colored chrome yellow for rapid identification apart from the bonnet and nozzle caps which should be coded according to their available flow. Class AA hydrants (&gt;1500 gpm) should have their nozzle caps and bonnet colored light blue, Class A hydrants (1000–1499 gpm) green, Class B hydrants (500–999 gpm) orange, Class C hydrants (0–499 gpm) red, and inoperable or end-of-system (risking water hammer) black. These aids arriving firefighters in determining how much water is available and whether to call for additional resources or find another hydrant.

Other codings can be and frequently are used, some of greater complexity, incorporating pressure information, others more simplistic. In Ottawa, Ontario, hydrant colors communicate different messages to firefighters; for example, if the inside of the hydrant is corroded so much that the interior diameter is too narrow for good pressure, it will be painted in a specific scheme to indicate to firefighters to move on to the next one. In many localities, a white or purple top indicates that the hydrant provides non-potable water. Where artistic and/or aesthetic considerations are paramount, hydrants can be extremely varied, or more subdued. In both instances this is usually at the cost of reduced practicality.

In Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and many other countries, most hydrants are located below ground and are reached by a riser, which provides the connections for the hoses. The covers can also be artistically designed.

==Signage==
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, hydrants are located in the ground. Yellow &quot;H&quot; hydrant signs indicate the location of the hydrants and are similar to the blue signs in Finland. Mounted on a small post or nearby wall etc., the two numbers indicate the diameter of the water main (top number) and the distance from the sign (lower number). Modern signs show these measurements in millimetres and metres, whereas older signs use inches and feet. Because the orders of magnitude are so different (6 inches versus 150 mm) there is no ambiguity whichever measuring system is used.

In areas of the United States without winter snow cover, blue reflectors embedded in the street are used to allow rapid identification of hydrants at night. In areas with snow cover, tall signs or flags are used so that hydrants can be found even if covered with snow. In rural areas tall narrow posts painted with visible colours such as red are attached to the hydrants to allow them to be found during heavy snowfall periods. The tops of the fire hydrants indicate available flow in gallons per minute; the color helps make a more accurate choice of what hydrants will be utilized to supply water to the fire scene.

*Blue: or more; very good flow
*Green: ; good for residential areas 
*Orange: ; marginally adequate
*Red: below ; inadequate

The hydrant bodies are also color-coded.

*Chrome Yellow: Municipal System
*Red: Private System
*Violet: Non-potable supply
These markings and colours are prescribed in &quot;NFPA 291: Recommended Practice for Water Flow Testing and Marking of Hydrants&quot;. but most municipal water authorities do not actually follow these guidelines.

In Australia, hydrant signage varies, with several types displayed across the country. Most Australian hydrants are underground, being of a ballcock system (spring hydrant type), and a separate standpipe with a central plunger is used to open the valve. Consequently, hydrant signage is essential, because of their concealed nature.
* Painted markersUsually a white or yellow (sometimes reflective paint) triangle or arrow painted on the road, pointing towards the side of the road the hydrant will be found on. These are most common in old areas, or on new roads where more advanced signs have not been installed. These are almost always coupled with a secondary form of signage.
* Hydrant Marker PlatesFound on power poles, fences, or street-signs, these are a comprehensive and effective system of identification. The plate consists of several codes; H (Potable water Hydrant), RH (Recycled/Non-Potable), P (Pathway, where the hydrant cover can be found), R (Roadway). The plate is vertically oriented, around 8 cm wide, and 15 cm high. It usually faces in the direction of the hydrant. Found on this plate, from top to bottom, are the following features:
** The codes listed above, Potable/Non-potable at the top, Path/Roadway on the bottom of the plate.
** Below this, a number giving the distance to the hydrant (in meters), then a second number below that giving the size (in millimeters) of the water main.
** A black line across the center of the plate indicates the hydrant is found on the opposite side of the road to which the plate is affixed.
** Plates for recycled water have a purple background, as well as the RH code, normal potable hydrants are white, with the H code.
* Road markers or Cat&#x27;s eyesAlmost exclusively blue, these are placed on one side or the other of the centre line of the road, to indicate on which side of the road the hydrant lies. They are visible for several hundred meters at night in heavy rain, further in clear conditions.

In Germany the hydrant marker plates follow the style of other marker plates pointing to underground installations. Fire hydrant marker plates have a red border. Other water hydrants may have a blue border. A gas hydrant would have a yellow background instead of a white one for fire hydrants. All of them have large central T with the installation identification on top of itan &quot;H&quot; or older &quot;UH&quot; is located in the ground, a &quot;OH&quot; is above ground, followed by the pipe inner diameter in millimeters (with a small 80 mm in residential areas). The numbers around the T allow to locate the installation in reference to the plate&#x27;s locationthe number left of the T is in meter left of the sign, the number right of the T is in meter right of the sign, and number below the T tells the distance in meter in front of the sign, where a negative number would point to a place behind the sign. The distance numbers are always given with a comma decimeter precision. If it is not a common fire hydrant type then another identification may be used, for example &quot;300 m³&quot; would point to a cistern usable to pump water from.

In East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) and former Socialist countries of Eastern Europe, there are two types of fire hydrants, of which one is on the public ground and the other inside a building. The ones inside a building are installed on a wall. They are big, rectangular boxes that also provide alarms (sirens), a fire extinguisher and, at certain times, emergency kits.

==Inspection and maintenance==
In most areas, fire hydrants require annual inspections and maintenance; they normally only have a one-year warranty, but some have 5- or even 10-year warranties, although the longer warranty does not remove the need for periodic inspections or maintenance. These inspections are generally performed by the local municipalities or fire departments, but they often do not inspect hydrants that are identified as private. Private hydrants are usually located on larger properties to adequately protect large buildings in case of a fire and in order to comply with the fire code. Such hydrants have met the requirements of insurance underwriters and are often referred to as UL/FM hydrants. Usually, companies are contracted out to inspect private fire hydrants, unless the municipality has undertaken that task. 

Some fire hydrant manufacturers recommend lubricating the head mechanism and restoring the head gaskets and O-rings annually in order that the fire hydrant perform the service expected of them, while others have incorporated proprietary features to provide long-term lubrication of the hydrant&#x27;s operating mechanism. In any case, periodic inspection of lubricants is recommended. Lubrication is generally done with a food-grade non-petroleum lubricant to avoid contamination of the distribution system.

Occasionally a stone or foreign object will mar the seat gasket. In this case, most hydrants have a special seat wrench that allows removal of the seat to replace the gasket or other broken parts without removing the hydrant from the ground. Hydrant extensions are also available for raising a hydrant if the grade around the hydrant changes. Without extending the height, the wrenches to remove caps would not clear and the break flanges for traffic models would not be located correctly in case they were hit. Hydrant repair kits are also available to repair sacrificial parts designed to break when hit by a vehicle.

Many fire departments use the hydrants for flushing out water line sediments. When doing so, they often use a hydrant diffuser, a device that diffuses the water so that it does not damage property and is less dangerous to bystanders than a solid stream. Some diffusers also dechlorinate the water to avoid ground contamination. Hydrants are also sometimes used as entry or exit points for pipe cleaning pigs.

In 2011, Code for America developed an &quot;Adopt a Hydrant&quot; website, which enables volunteers to sign up to shovel out fire hydrants after snowstorms. As of 2014, the system has been implemented in Boston; Providence, Rhode Island; Anchorage, Alaska; and Chicago.

==Non-pressurized (dry) Hydrants ==

In rural areas where municipal water systems are not available, dry hydrants are used to supply water for fighting fires. A dry hydrant is analogous to a standpipe. A dry hydrant is usually an unpressurized, permanently installed pipe that has one end below the water level of a lake or pond. This end usually has a strainer to prevent debris or wildlife, such as fish, from entering the pipe. The other end is above ground and has a hard sleeve connector.

When needed, a pumper fire engine will pump from the lake or pond by drafting water. This is done by vacuuming the air out of the dry hydrant, hard sleeve, and the fire engine pump with a primer. Because lower pressure now exists at the pump intake, atmospheric pressure on the water and the weight of the water forces water into the above-water portion of the dry hydrant, into the hard sleeve, and finally into the pump. This water can then be pumped by the engine&#x27;s centrifugal pump.

==Other types==
*Water wells are also sometimes classified as fire hydrants if they can supply enough water volume and pressure.
*Standpipes are connections for firehoses within a building and serve the same purpose inside larger structures as fire hydrants do outdoors. Standpipes may be &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;wet&quot; (permanently filled with water); a dry standpipe requires an external source of water such as firefighting equipment.

==History==
Before piped mains supplies, water for firefighting had to be kept in buckets and cauldrons ready for use by &#x27;bucket-brigades&#x27; or brought with a horse-drawn fire-pump. From the 16th century, as wooden mains water systems were installed, firefighters would dig down to the pipes and drill a hole for water to fill a “wet well” for the buckets or pumps. This had to be filled and plugged afterwards, hence the common US term for a hydrant, &#x27;fireplug&#x27;. A marker would be left to indicate where a &#x27;plug&#x27; had already been drilled to enable firefighters to find ready-drilled holes. Later wooden systems had pre-drilled holes and plugs.

When cast iron pipes replaced the wood, permanent underground access points were included for the fire fighters. Some countries provide access covers to these points, while others attach fixed above-ground hydrantsthe first cast iron ones were patented in 1801 by Frederick Graff, then chief-engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works. Invention since then has targeted problems such as tampering, freezing, connection, reliability etc.

<text>Jean Baptiste Charles Henri Hector, Count of Estaing (; 24 November 1729 – 28 April 1794) was a French military officer and writer. He began his service as a soldier in the War of the Austrian Succession, briefly spending time as a prisoner of war of the British during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Naval exploits during the latter war prompted him to change branches of service, and he transferred to the French Navy.

Following France&#x27;s entry into the American War of Independence in 1778, d&#x27;Estaing led a fleet to aid the American rebels. He participated in a failed Franco-American siege of Newport, Rhode Island, in 1778, and the equally unsuccessful 1779 Siege of Savannah. He did have success in the Caribbean before returning to France in 1780. His difficulties working with American counterparts are cited among the reasons these operations in North America failed.

Although d&#x27;Estaing sympathized with revolutionaries during the French Revolution, he held a personal loyalty to the French royal family. Because of this he came under suspicion, and was executed by guillotine in the Reign of Terror.

== Early years ==
Hector was born on 24 November 1729 at the Château de Ravel in Auvergne to Charles-François, the Marquis de Saillant and Marie-Henriette Colbert de Maulevrier, a descendant of Jean-Baptiste Colbert. His father was a lieutenant general in the French Army from a family with a long history of service to the French crown. The young d&#x27;Estaing was educated alongside Louis, the Dauphin (father of the future Louis XVI), who was born at about the same time. D&#x27;Estaing thus became close friends with the Dauphin and served in his retinue.

In May 1738 at the age of 9 he was nominally enrolled in the musketeers, as his aristocratic family chose military over civil service for him. He rose through the ranks, eventually joining the Regiment de Rouergue (fr.) as a lieutenant in 1746. That same year he married Marie-Sophie Rousselet de Crozon de Château-Renault, granddaughter of the celebrated Marshal Château-Renault, they would later had one son Théodat, who would died in a childhood accident in 1759. His regiment was called to serve in the War of the Austrian Succession. D&#x27;Estaing served as aide-de-camp to Marshal Saxe throughout the Flanders campaigns from 1746 to 1748. During these years he was promoted to colonel in command of Regiment de Rouergue, and was wounded at the 1748 Siege of Maastricht.

Following the war King Louis XV embarked on a program to modernize his army on the successful model of Frederick the Great&#x27;s Prussian army. D&#x27;Estaing became one of the leading reformers. After a few years, the Regiment de Rouergue was viewed &quot;as a model of the infantry&quot;. Seeking to gain experience in diplomacy, d&#x27;Estaing accompanied the French ambassador to England for a time.

== Seven Years&#x27; War in India ==

When hostilities broke out between the British and French colonies in North America, d&#x27;Estaing considered joining the forces of Louis-Joseph de Montcalm that sailed in 1755, but his family dissuaded him from doing so. When an expedition to the East Indies was organized, he applied to participate without consulting his family. His participation was ensured when he was offered a back-dated promotion to brigadier-general, provided he could transfer command of his regiment to someone else, which he did. In early January 1757, shortly before embarking, d&#x27;Estaing was awarded the Order of Saint Louis.

=== Lally&#x27;s campaigns ===

After a lengthy journey, the fleet of the comte d&#x27;Aché, carrying the expeditionary forces whose land commander was the count de Lally, arrived off British-occupied Cuddalore in southern India on 28 April 1758. Lally disembarked his troops, established a blockade around the town, and then traveled to Pondicherry to organize the delivery of siege equipment. On 4 May French forces occupied the town and partially blockaded Fort St. David. The siege equipment was delayed in its arrival, but the garrison was eventually compelled to surrender after 17 days of siege operations. D&#x27;Estaing commanded Lally&#x27;s left, overseeing the approaches and placing of batteries. He continued to serve under Lally in his campaigns against the British in southern India. He opposed Lally&#x27;s decision to lift the siege of Tanjore (the only one in Lally&#x27;s war council to do so) following the British seizure of Karikal. When Lally began to besiege Madras in December 1758, d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s division was positioned in the center of the French line. When the British made a sortie against that sector, d&#x27;Estaing advanced alone to reconnoiter their movements. He was surrounded by British troops, unhorsed, and twice wounded by bayonet before surrendering.

D&#x27;Estaing was taken into Madras, where he was confined by the order of Governor George Pigot. Pigot offered to release him on parole, but d&#x27;Estaing refused, preferring instead to be exchanged so that he could resume fighting. The arrival of a British fleet off Madras in February 1759 convinced d&#x27;Estaing to accept the offer of parole, which was conditioned on his not fighting against the British in the East Indies. In May 1759 he sailed for Île-de-France (present-day Mauritius).

=== French East India Company service ===
While d&#x27;Estaing was at Île-de-France, word arrived of a prisoner exchange agreement between France and Britain. D&#x27;Estaing, however, was excluded from this agreement because he had been paroled before its date. While requests were forwarded to India to negotiate his inclusion in the cartel, d&#x27;Estaing decided to enter the service of the French East India Company, leading a naval expedition to gather resources for Île-de-France. D&#x27;Estaing thought he would finesse his parole status by declaring himself to be a &quot;spectator&quot; in case the force came into conflict with the British or their allies, and permitted his second in command to lead such operations.

In command of a two-vessel company fleet (the 50-gun &quot;Condé&quot; and the frigate &quot;l&#x27;Expédition&quot;), d&#x27;Estaing sailed for the Persian Gulf in September 1759. From an Arab convoy captured at the end of the month, he learnt of a British ship at Muscat. In a daring commando operation, 50 of &quot;Condé&quot; men entered the well-fortified harbour and boarded the ship, taking it without resistance. In their haste to depart, the men cut lines necessary for towing the ship, and alarm was eventually raised in the port. A swarm of small boats was driven off by precision fire from &quot;Condé&quot;, allowing a new line to be attached to the prize so that she could be towed out of the harbour. D&#x27;Estaing then destroyed the British factory at Bandar-Abbas, before sailing for Sumatra. While en route he detached his accumulated prize ships, sending them to Île-de-France. D&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s success was notable: in three months he had acquired significant prizes at the expense of only five casualties (28 men died of smallpox).

After a slow crossing (retarded by calms and contrary winds), d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s fleet reached the coast of Sumatra in early February 1760. There he captured the British factory at Natal, which he eventually turned over to the Dutch. He sailed for the British outpost at Tappanooly (present-day Tapanuli in the Indonesian Province of North Sumatra). Its commander put up stiff resistance, fleeing into the hills when it was clear the French would be victorious. D&#x27;Estaing consequently decided to destroy the fortifications rather than hunt down the British. He next sailed for Padang, a major Dutch settlement, where he supplemented his forces with local recruits and resupplied.

He sailed for Bencoolen (now Bengkulu, the capital of the Indonesian province of Bengkulu), the main British settlement on Sumatra. The town was defended by Fort Marlborough and a garrison of 500 Europeans and local sepoys, with the potential to raise over 1,000 additional Malay militia. Although these forces were alerted to the French arrival by a ship that d&#x27;Estaing chased into the harbour, the first broadside directed at the fort panicked its defenders, who fled into the surrounding jungle. D&#x27;Estaing spent a day in pursuit of some of these troops. He used Fort Marlborough as a base to subdue the remaining lesser British settlements on the west side of Sumatra. He returned to Île-de-France ten months after his departure.

Ordered back to France, d&#x27;Estaing boarded a westbound company ship. Just off the French coast the ship was captured by British patrols. He was imprisoned at Plymouth, charged with violating his parole, before being granted limited freedom from a house in London. He was able to successfully defend himself against the charges, and was allowed to return to France. Upon his arrival, d&#x27;Estaing was commissioned as field marshal, the reward for his service in the East Indies.

== Interwar years ==

=== Governor of the Leeward Islands ===
In the early months of 1762 France made preparations for a major expedition against Portuguese territories in South America. Promoted to lieutenant general of the army on July 25, 1762, d&#x27;Estaing was also given the rank of chef d&#x27;escadre (rear admiral) in the French Navy in recognition for his exploits, a rank lesser than that he held in the army. In order to clarify his command role in the expedition, the king formally removed him from the army and gave him the rank of lieutenant general in the navy. The expedition was called off when preliminary peace terms were agreed.

In 1764 King Louis appointed d&#x27;Estaing governor general of the French Leeward Islands, a post he held until 1766. Based principally in Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), he recruited French colonists known as Acadians to settle there. They had been deported from the French colony of Acadia in present-day Canada by the British during the war, as they had refused to take loyalty oaths to Britain. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, as many Acadian immigrants died of tropical disease. Others sought to resettle elsewhere because of the hot climate and poor land.

=== Home service ===
D&#x27;Estaing returned to France in 1767. At this time he had to deal with the formal separation from his wife, which they had agreed to in writing in 1756, before his departure for India. The division of their properties was somewhat contentious, leading to court proceedings and appeals that ultimately failed to divide their estates.

In 1772 d&#x27;Estaing was appointed naval inspector and governor at Brest, the country&#x27;s principal Atlantic naval station. In 1777 he was promoted to vice admiral of the Asian and American seas (&quot;vice-amiral des mers d&#x27;Asie et d&#x27;Amérique&quot;).

== American War of Independence ==
At the entry of France into the American War of Independence in 1778, D&#x27;Estaing left Toulon in command of a fleet of twelve ships of the line and four frigates. He intended to assist the American colonies against Great Britain. He sailed on 13 April, and, between the 11th and the 22nd of July, blockaded the smaller British fleet of Lord Howe at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, off the southern entrance to New York Harbour. He did not enter the harbour because his largest ships were believed to be unable to clear the bar at its mouth.

=== Newport ===

In cooperation with the American generals, d&#x27;Estaing planned an attack on Newport, Rhode Island, preparatory to which he compelled the British to destroy some war vessels that were in the harbor. Before the concerted attack could take place, he put to sea against the British fleet, which was under Admiral Howe. Owing to a violent storm, which arose suddenly and compelled the two fleets to separate before engaging in battle, many of his vessels were so shattered that he found it necessary to put into Boston for repairs. He sailed for the West Indies on 4 November.

=== West Indies ===

He arrived in the West Indies in December 1778, shortly after the British began operations to capture St. Lucia. He sailed in an attempt to relieve the place, but he was defeated in both land and naval efforts to prevent its capture.

In June 1779, with his fleet reinforced by arrival of ten ships of the line commanded by Comte de Grasse, he took advantage of the temporary absence of his British opponent, Admiral John Byron, to take action against nearby British possessions. He first detached forces that captured St. Vincent on 18 June, and then set sail with his entire fleet, intending to capture Barbados. When he was unable to make progress against the prevailing westerly trade winds, he turned his sights on Grenada. On 2 July he arrived off the island, which his forces took by storm two days later.

Admiral Byron had been alerted to the capture of St. Vincent, and was sailing with a force to retake it when he learned that d&#x27;Estaing was at Grenada. He changed course, making all sail for Grenada, and arrived there early on 6 July. Although d&#x27;Estaing had been alerted to Byron&#x27;s progress, and his fleet outnumbered Byron&#x27;s, he still scrambled to embark soldiers and sail away from the island. Byron, unaware that d&#x27;Estaing had been reinforced, ordered a general chase, which resulted in a somewhat disorganized battle. D&#x27;Estaing refused to press his numerical advantage, and both fleets ended up retiring to their bases for repairs. In August, d&#x27;Estaing sailed for Savannah, Georgia, to join forces with the Americans who wanted to recapture the British-held city.

=== Siege of Savannah ===


The siege consisted of a joint Franco-American attempt to retake Savannah from 16 September 1779 to 18 October 1779, with d&#x27;Estaing in overall command of the combined forces. After weeks of fruitless bombardment, on 9 October 1779, a major assault against the British siege works failed. During the attack, d&#x27;Estaing was twice wounded. When the assault failed, d&#x27;Estaing lifted the siege. British forces remained in control of coastal Georgia until they withdrew near the end of the war.

== Return to France ==

D&#x27;Estaing returned to France in 1780 on crutches. He fell into disfavour at the court, and was strongly criticised by his subordinates. Friends of Benjamin Franklin, then minister in France, jokingly suggested that the French court at Versailles should provide America with the names of other gifted admirals.

In 1781 France sent a fleet under Admiral de Grasse, along with an expeditionary force to reinforce the Americans in Virginia. Admiral de Grasse defeated the British in the Battle of the Chesapeake, holding a blockade against their forces and contributing to the surrender of the British army at Yorktown in 1781.

Three years later, d&#x27;Estaing was placed at the head of the Franco-Spanish fleet assembled before Cádiz. The peace between the US, Great Britain and France was signed, and no operations took place.

On September 28, 1784, Governor John Houstoun of Georgia granted four 5000-acre tracts of vacant land in Franklin County, Georgia to d&#x27;Estaing and his heirs.

After the American war, d&#x27;Estaing turned his attention to politics. He was made a grandee of Spain. In 1787, he was elected to the Assembly of Notables. When the French Revolution broke out, he supported the revolutionary cause. In 1789, he was appointed as commanding general of the Versailles National Guard, and in 1792 he was promoted to admiral&#x27;s rank by the National Assembly. While supporting liberal reforms, he stayed loyal to the royal family. In the 1793 trial of Marie Antoinette, during the Reign of Terror, he testified in her favour. On this account, and because of certain friendly letters which had passed between him and the queen, he was himself brought to trial, charged with being a reactionary. He was sent to the guillotine on 28 April 1794. Before his execution, d&#x27;Estaing wrote, &quot;After my head falls off, send it to the English, they will pay a good deal for it!&quot; Both his wife Marie-Sophie Rousselot and his only child had died before him.

In his moments of leisure, d&#x27;Estaing wrote a poem, &quot;Le Rêve&quot; (1755), a tragedy &quot;Les Thermopyles&quot; (1789), and a book on the colonies.

<doc id="280523" wikidata="Q8015736" url="?curid=280523" title="William Monson (Royal Navy officer)">
<text>Vice-Admiral Sir William Monson (1569 – February 1643) was an English admiral and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1601.

==Life==
Monson was the third son of Sir John Monson of South Carlton, Lincolnshire. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 2 May 1581 at the age of 14.

==Career==
Monson ran away to sea in 1585, being then according to his own account sixteen. His first services were in a privateer in an action with a Spanish ship in the Bay of Biscay, of which he gives an account in his Naval Tracts. In the Armada year he served as Lieutenant of the &quot;Charles,&quot; a small ship of the Queen&#x27;s. There being at that time no regular naval service, Monson is next found serving with the adventurous Earl of Cumberland (1558–1605), whom he followed as a young twenty old as second in command of the &quot;Azores Voyage of 1589&quot;. His success there led him to join Cumberland&#x27;s other ventures in 1591 and 1593. The voyage in 1592 however was the most spectacular and led to the capture of the rich carrack &quot;Madre de Deus&quot;. After this, in another venture Monson was taken prisoner by the Spaniards in a recaptured prize after an engagement off Berlengas Islands, and was for a time detained at Lisbon in captivity. He was awarded MA at Oxford on 9 July 1594 and was also a student of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1594. His cruises must have brought him some profit, for in 1595 he was able to marry. The Earl offended him by showing favour to another follower, and Monson turned elsewhere. In the expedition to Cádiz in 1596, he commanded the &quot;Due Repulse&quot; and was also knighted there. From this time until the conclusion of the war with Spain he was in constant employment. In 1602 he commanded the last squadron fitted out in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by defeating a Spanish and Portuguese fleet at Sesimbra Bay near Lisbon capturing a rich large carrack. He also took prisoner the same man who captured Monson at Berlengas nearly ten years earlier.

Monson was elected Member of Parliament for Malmesbury in 1601. In 1604 he was appointed Admiral of the Narrow Seas, the equivalent of the Channel Fleet of modern times. Like several Jacobean courtiers and officials, Mansell received gifts of money from Spanish diplomats between 1604 and 1625. In 1613, the diplomat Sir John Digby was surprised to discover records of these payments. According to the historian Garrett Mattingly, in exchange for his Spanish pension he willingly provided the Spanish Ambassador with information on the latest strength of the English Navy, or the movements of Dutch and English ships in the Narrow Seas.

In 1614 he was sent to the coasts of Scotland and Ireland to repress the pirates who then swarmed on the coast. Monson claimed to have extirpated these pests, but it is certain that they were numerous a generation later. After 1614 he saw no further active service till 1635. In 1635 he went to sea as vice-admiral of the fleet fitted out by King Charles I with the first ship money. He spent the last years of his life in writing his &quot;Tracts&quot;.

Monson died in February 1643 and was buried at St Martin in the Fields.

==Legacy==
His claim to be remembered is not based on his services as a naval officer, though they were undoubtedly honourable, but on his &quot;Tracts&quot;. These treatises consist in part of historical narratives, and in part of argumentative proposals for the reform of abuses, or the development of the naval resources of the country. They form by far the best account by a contemporary of the naval life and transactions of the reign of Elizabeth I and the beginning of the reign of King James. Monson takes care to do himself full justice, but he is not unfair to his contemporaries. His style is thoroughly modern, and has hardly a trace of the poetry of the Elizabethans. He was the first naval officer in the modern sense of the word, a gentleman by birth and education who was trained to the sea, and not simply a soldier put in to fight, with a sailing master to handle the ship for him, or a tarpaulin who was a sailor only. The one authority for the life of Sir William Monson is his own &quot;Tracts&quot;, but a very good account of him is included by Southey in his &quot;Lives of the Admirals&quot;, vol. v. The Tracts were first printed in the third volume of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Voyages&quot;, but they have been edited for the Navy Record Society by Mr Oppenheim.

==Family==
Monson&#x27;s elder brother, Sir Thomas Monson (1564–1641), was one of James I&#x27;s favourites, and was made a baronet in 1611. He held a position of trust at the Tower of London, a circumstance which led to his arrest as one of the participators in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. He was, however, soon released. His eldest son was Sir John Monson, Bart. (1600–1683), a member of parliament under Charles I, and another son was Sir William Monson (c. 1607–1678), who was created an Irish peer as Viscount Monson of Castlemaine in 1628. Having been a member of the court which tried Charles I the viscount was deprived of his honours and was sentenced to imprisonment for life in 1661. Sir John Monson&#x27;s descendant, another Sir John Monson, Bart. (1693–1748), was created Baron Monson in 1728. His youngest son was George Monson (1730–1776), who served with the English troops in India from 1758 to 1763. The baron&#x27;s eldest son was John, the 2nd baron (1727–1774), whose son William Monson (1760–1807) served in the Mahratta War under General Lake. William&#x27;s only son William John (1796–1862) became 6th Baron Monson in succession to his cousin Frederick John, the 5th baron, in October 1841. His son William John, the 7th baron (1829–1898), was created Viscount Oxenbridge in 1886. When he died without sons in 1898 the viscounty became extinct, but the barony descended to his brother Debonnaire John (1830–1900), whose son Augustus Debonnaire John (b. 1868) became 9th Baron Monson in 1900. Another of Viscount Oxenbridge&#x27;s brothers was Sir Edmund John Monson, Bart. (b. 1834), who, after filling many other diplomatic appointments, was British ambassador in Paris from 1896 to 1904.

<doc id="280529" wikidata="Q864480" url="?curid=280529" title="Truncated cube">
<text>In geometry, the truncated cube, or truncated hexahedron, is an Archimedean solid. It has 14 regular faces (6 octagonal and 8 triangular), 36 edges, and 24 vertices.

If the truncated cube has unit edge length, its dual triakis octahedron has edges of lengths and , 
where &quot;δS&quot; is the silver ratio, +1.

==Area and volume==
The area &quot;A&quot; and the volume &quot;V&quot; of a truncated cube of edge length &quot;a&quot; are:
:formula_1

==Orthogonal projections==
The &quot;truncated cube&quot; has five special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: triangles, and octagons. The last two correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes.
==Spherical tiling==
The truncated cube can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.
==Cartesian coordinates==

Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated hexahedron centered at the origin with edge length 2 are all the permutations of

:(±, ±1, ±1),

where δS=+1.

If we let a parameter &quot;ξ&quot;= , in the case of a Regular Truncated Cube, then the parameter &quot;ξ&quot; can be varied between ±1. A value of 1 produces a cube, 0 produces a cuboctahedron, and negative values produces self-intersecting octagrammic faces.

If the self-intersected portions of the octagrams are removed, leaving squares, and truncating the triangles into hexagons, truncated octahedra are produced, and the sequence ends with the central squares being reduced to a point, and creating an octahedron.

== Dissection ==

The truncated cube can be dissected into a central cube, with six square cupolae around each of the cube&#x27;s faces, and 8 regular tetrahedra in the corners. This dissection can also be seen within the runcic cubic honeycomb, with cube, tetrahedron, and rhombicuboctahedron cells.

This dissection can be used to create a Stewart toroid with all regular faces by removing two square cupolae and the central cube. This excavated cube has 16 triangles, 12 squares, and 4 octagons.

== Vertex arrangement==
It shares the vertex arrangement with three nonconvex uniform polyhedra:
==Related polyhedra==
The truncated cube is related to other polyhedra and tilings in symmetry.

The truncated cube is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.
=== Symmetry mutations===
This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of uniform truncated polyhedra with vertex configurations (3.2&quot;n&quot;.2&quot;n&quot;), and [&quot;n&quot;,3] Coxeter group symmetry, and a series of polyhedra and tilings &quot;n&quot;.8.8.

=== Alternated truncation===

Truncating alternating vertices of the cube gives the chamfered tetrahedron, i.e. the edge truncation of the tetrahedron.

The truncated triangular trapezohedron is another polyhedron which can be formed from cube edge truncation.

== Related polytopes ==
The &quot;truncated cube&quot;, is second in a sequence of truncated hypercubes:
== Truncated cubical graph ==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a truncated cubical graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the &quot;truncated cube&quot;, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 24 vertices and 36 edges, and is a cubic Archimedean graph.

<text>Admiral Sir George Pocock or Pococke, KB (6 March 1706 – 3 April 1792) was a British officer of the Royal Navy.

==Family==
Pocock was born in Thames Ditton in Surrey, the son of Thomas Pocock, a chaplain in the Royal Navy. His great grandfather was Rev. Dr. Laurence Pocock, Rector of Brightwalton in Berkshire, and his ancestors had long been resident at adjoining Chieveley in the same county.

==Early career==
George Pocock entered the navy in 1718, serving aboard under the patronage of his maternal uncle, Captain Streynsham Master (1682–1724). He became lieutenant in April 1725 and commander in 1733. In 1738 he was promoted to post-captain and granted command of the 20-gun . After serving in the West Indies he was sent to join the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, Rear-Admiral Charles Watson, in 1754 as captain of the 58-gun . Watson&#x27;s squadron co-operated with Clive in the conquest of Bengal. In 1755 Pocock became rear-admiral, and was promoted to vice-admiral in 1756.

==Command of British naval forces in Indian waters==

On the death of Watson in 1757 Pocock took the command of the naval forces in the East Indies. In 1758 he was joined by Commodore Charles Steevens (d. 1761), but the reinforcement only raised the squadron to seven small line-of-battle ships. War being now in progress between France and England the French sent a naval force from their islands in the Indian Ocean into the Bay of Bengal to the assistance of Pondicherry. To intercept the arrival of these reinforcements for the enemy now became the object of Pocock. The French force was indeed of less intrinsic strength than his own. Comte D&#x27;Aché who commanded it had to make up his line by including several Indiamen which were only armed merchant ships. Yet the number of the French was superior and Pocock was required by the practice of his time to fight by the old official fighting instructions. He had to bring his ships into action in a line with the enemy, and to preserve his formation while the engagement lasted.

All Pocock&#x27;s encounters with D&#x27;Aché were indecisive. The first battle, on 29 April 1758, failed to prevent the Frenchmen from reaching Pondicherry. After a second and more severe engagement on 3 August, the French admiral returned to Mauritius, and when the monsoon set in Pocock went round to Bombay. He was back early in spring, relieving the Siege of Madras, but the French admiral did not return to the Bay of Bengal until September. Again Pocock was unable to prevent his opponent from reaching Pondicherry, and a well-contested battle between them on 10 September 1759 proved again indecisive. The French government was nearly bankrupt, and D&#x27;Aché could get no stores for his squadron. He was compelled to return to the islands, and the British were left in possession of the Coromandel and Malabar Coasts. Pocock went home in 1760, and in 1761 was made a Knight of the Bath and admiral.

==Later career==
In 1762 he was appointed to the command of the naval forces in the combined expedition which took Havana. The siege, which began on 7 June and lasted until 13 August, was rendered deadly by the climate. The final victory was largely attributable to the vigorous and intelligent aid which Pocock gave to the troops. His share in the prize money was no less than £122,697. On his return to England Pocock is said to have been disappointed because another officer, Sir Charles Saunders, was chosen in preference to himself as a member of the Admiralty Board, and to have resigned in consequence. It is certain that he resigned his commission in 1766. His memorial in Westminster Abbey, a statue of Britannia holding a thunderbolt, is by John Bacon and was erected in 1796.

In 1763 Pocock married Sophia Dent (1733–1767), the widow of his friend Commodore Digby Dent, daughter of George Francis Drake of Madras and step-daughter of George Morton Pitt who had inherited Pitt&#x27;s house at Twickenham now known as Orleans House. Their son George (1765-1840) who married Charlotte Mary, daughter of Edward Long (historian), was created a baronet and their daughter Sophia (died 1811) married John 4th Earl Powlett.

<text>Edinburgh Airport is an international airport located in the Ingliston area of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is located west of the city centre, just off the M8 and M9 motorways. It is owned and operated by Edinburgh Airport Limited.

The airport is the busiest airport in Scotland based on passenger numbers, with 14.4 million passengers flying from the airport in 2023, a 28% increased on passenger numbers from 2022. A total of 35 airlines use the airport to fly to over 152 international destinations. During 2024, Edinburgh Airport experienced its busiest year in terms of passenger numbers, with a total of 15 million passengers. It also marked the busiest year for any Scottish airport in history. As well as being the busiest airport in Scotland, Edinburgh Airport is the sixth busiest airport in the United Kingdom.

==History==
===Early years===
Turnhouse Aerodrome was the northernmost British air defence base in World War I used by the Royal Flying Corps. The small base opened in 1916 and it was used to house the 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron from 1925, which consisted of DH 9As, Westland Wapitis, Hawker Harts, and Hawker Hind light bombers. All the aircraft used a grass airstrip.

In 1918, the Royal Air Force was formed and the airfield was named &quot;RAF Turnhouse&quot; and ownership was transferred to the Air Ministry.

When the Second World War broke out, RAF Fighter Command took control over the airfield and a runway of was paved to handle the Supermarine Spitfire. During the Battle of Britain, 3, 65, and 141 Squadrons were present at the airbase.

===Post-Second World War===
When the war ended, the airfield remained under military control. It was officially opened for commercial traffic on 19 May 1947. The first commercial flight to use the airport was a British European Airways service from London (Northolt) to Shetland, with Edinburgh and Aberdeen being intermediate stopping points. The aircraft was an 18-seat Douglas C47.

In 1952, the runway was extended to 6000 ft to handle the Vampire FB5s operated by the resident 603 Squadron, and an aircraft arresting barrier net was installed to protect traffic on the adjacent A9 road. The net remained in place until the early 1970s and was used to stop one of the Ferranti Flying Unit Buccaneers which had overrun the runway. A further use was in 1970 when a Meteor TT20, operated by the RN Fleet Requirement Unit, overran the runway and ended up in the net. In 1956, a new passenger terminal was built to provide an improved commercial service; five years later it was extended. After the disbandment of the 603 Squadron in March 1957, the Air Ministry transferred ownership to the Ministry of Aviation in 1960 to offer improved commercial service to the airport. Flying was temporarily diverted to East Fortune, which had its runway extended to accommodate the airliners of the period.

===BAA ownership===
The British Airports Authority (BAA) took over ownership of the airport on 1 April 1971 at a time when the original terminal building was running at about eight times its design capacity. Immediate improvements to the terminal were cosmetic, such as extra seating and TV monitors for flight information, and it took two years for plans to be proposed for a completely new terminal and runway redesign. Public consultation on planning started in November 1971 and ended in February 1972. The initial stages of the redevelopment began in June 1973; they included a diversion of the River Almond. Work on the new terminal building, designed by Sir Robert Matthew, started in March 1975, and the building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 May 1977, opening to the public two days later.

Although the original main runway 13/31 (which is now 12/30) served the airport well, its alignment (NW-SE) had the disadvantage of suffering from severe crosswinds, and the other two minor runways were very short and could not be readily extended, so movements were transferred to a new runway (07/25, which has since become 06/24) in an addition completely outside the original airfield boundary. This runway, completed in 1977, is in length, and was able to take all modern airliners including Concorde. A new terminal was built alongside the runway to cater for the additional traffic. The old terminal and hangars were converted into a cargo centre.

International service from Edinburgh began in 1962 with direct service to Dublin, but for many years international flights were charter and private only. This started to change during the late 1970s, with direct services to continental Europe (Amsterdam, 1975). By the mid-1980s direct routes included Paris, Düsseldorf, Brussels, Frankfurt and Copenhagen, but direct transatlantic flights were not yet possible as Glasgow-Prestwick was the only &quot;designated gateway&quot; in Scotland under the US-UK Bermuda II Agreement. By the time BAA had been privatised in 1987, Edinburgh Airport handled over 1.8 million passengers each year; compared to the 681,000 passengers handled in 1971 when BAA first took control of the airport.

RAF Turnhouse was operational near the passenger terminal of the airport for all of the post-war period but was finally closed in 1997.

Since the original terminal upgrade in 1977, there have been major reconstructions, including extensions of the two passenger terminal aprons and a major expansion of car parking facilities, including a multi-storey car park in 2004. In 2005, a new air traffic control tower was completed for £10m. An extension to the terminal called the South East Pier opened in September 2006. This extension initially added six gates on a new pier to the southeast of the original building. A further four gates were added to the South East Pier at the end of 2008.

On 19 October 2011, BAA Limited announced its intention to sell the airport, following a decision by the UK&#x27;s Competition Commission requiring BAA to sell either Glasgow Airport or Edinburgh Airport. BAA announced on 23 April 2012 that it had sold Edinburgh Airport to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for a price of £807.2 million, equivalent to £ million in .

===GIP ownership===

In 2013, a further extension to the passenger terminal was announced, taking the terminal building up to the Edinburgh Airport tram stop. The Edinburgh Trams opening in May 2014 created the first rail connection to Edinburgh Airport. Whilst the number of passengers has increased, the number of flights decreased in 2014 due to planes operating at a higher capacity. Passenger traffic at Edinburgh Airport reached a record level in 2015 with over 11.1 million passengers and over 109,000 aircraft movements.

The terminal building was expanded as a result of an investment of £40million. A new £25million expansion project involving the construction of a new 6,000 m2 building, housing a security hall and retail areas, was also completed. On 23 February 2016, Ryanair announced a growth of 20% in passenger numbers, bringing the airline&#x27;s annual passenger capacity at Edinburgh Airport to 2.5 million. This was coupled with the news of six new services to Ryanair&#x27;s winter schedule from Edinburgh and more services on its popular European destinations.

In February 2016, consultancy firm Biggar Economics announced that Edinburgh Airport contributes almost £1 billion annually to the Scottish economy. As part of the expansion works, Runway 12/30 was officially withdrawn from use on 29 March 2018.

===VINCI ownership===
On 17 April 2024, Vinci SA announced that it had reached an agreement with GIP to acquire a 50.01% shareholding of the airport for £1.27 billion, with GIP retaining 49.99%. The transaction was concluded on 25 June 2024.

In December 2024, Edinburgh Airport became the first in Scotland to record over 15 million passengers in a calendar year.

===Road===
The airport lies on the A8 road, and can be reached by the M8 motorway and the M9 motorway. The airport can also be reached from the M90 motorway via the Queensferry Crossing.

===Train===
The airport has no dedicated railway station. However, it is served by the nearby Edinburgh Gateway station, which serves as an interchange with Edinburgh Trams services to the airport. The tram line also connects the airport to the nearby Edinburgh Park railway station.

A more extensive Edinburgh Airport Rail Link project to provide a direct heavy rail link was cancelled in 2007 due to increasing costs.

===Tram===
The airport is served by Edinburgh Trams, a light rail link.

The line from the airport travels eastwards through the western suburbs and the city centre of Edinburgh before heading north to Leith, eventually terminating at Newhaven.


==Accidents and incidents==
*On 20 July 1970, a Hawker Siddeley HS-125-3B (G-AXPS) operated by the Imperial Tobacco Company crashed on takeoff from Turnhouse on an empty positioning flight to Newcastle. The aircraft was a total loss and whilst the pilot was uninjured, the copilot was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. The probable cause of the crash was thought to be the application of an incorrect rudder following a simulated engine failure on take-off. The reason for this application of an incorrect rudder has not been determined.
*A De Havilland Moth Minor (G-AFOZ) crashed at Turnhouse during a low-level display on 3 May 1975. One of the two occupants died in the hospital the following day.
*On 27 February 2001, a Loganair Shorts 360 (G-BNMT) operating a Royal Mail flight to Belfast, crashed into the Firth of Forth shortly after taking off from Edinburgh at 1730 GMT. Both crew members were killed, but there were no passengers on board. A fatal accident inquiry later blamed a buildup of slush in the aircraft&#x27;s engines before the crash. A protective covering had not been fitted to the engine intakes while the aircraft was parked at Edinburgh for several hours in heavy snow.

<doc id="280550" wikidata="Q240540" url="?curid=280550" title="Lamphun province">
<text>Lamphun (, ; Northern Thai: หละปูน, ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), and lies in upper northern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Chiang Mai, Lampang, and Tak.

==Geography==
Lamphun is in the Ping River valley. It is surrounded by mountain chains, with the Thanon Thong Chai Range in the west and the Khun Tan Range in the east of the province. It is some 670 kilometres north of Bangkok and 26 kilometres south of Chiang Mai. The total forest area is or 57.8 percent of the provincial area. Lamphun is regarded as the smallest province of northern region of Thailand.

===National parks===
There are a total of three national parks, two of which are in region 16 (Chiang Mai) and one, Doi Chong, which lies in region 13 (Lampang branch) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Mae Ping National Park, 
* Mae Takrai National Park, 
* Doi Chong National Park, 

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
There are two wildlife sanctuaries located in region 16 (Chiang Mai) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Omkoi Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Doi Phu Muang Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
Under its old name of Haripunchai, Lamphun was the northernmost city of the Mon kingdom of the Dvaravati period, and also the last to fall to the Thai. In the late-12th century it came under siege from the Khmer, but did not fall. However, in 1281 King Mengrai of Lan Na finally seized the city, and made it part of his kingdom. After Burmese expansion in the 16th century, Lamphun was under Burmese rule for two centuries. In the 18th century, with the rise of Thonburi and Bangkok against Burmese rule, local leaders from Lampang agreed to be their allies. Lamphun was finally freed from the Burmese and ruled by relatives of Lampang&#x27;s leader, gaining vassal status from Bangkok. Eventually, after the administrative reform of Bangkok government in the late-19th century, Lamphun became, as a province, a part of Siam.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the temple Wat Phra That Haripunchai, which was already the main temple of the city Lamphun during Mon times. The gold-covered chedi is said to contain a relic of Buddha.

The provincial flower is the Flame of the Forest (&quot;Butea monosperma&quot;), and the provincial tree is the Rain Tree (&quot;Samanea saman&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the chubby frog (&quot;Glyphoglossus molossus&quot;).

==Transport==
* Air: Lamphun is served by Lamphun Airport.
* Rail: Lamphun&#x27;s main station is Lamphun Railway Station.

==Food==
*Kaeng khae, a spicy curry consisting mainly of vegetables with chicken, frog, fish or snails.
*Kuaitiao lamyai, stewed pork noodles soup with dried longan, originated in Lamphun.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 51 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 551 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

For national elections the province is divided into three constituencies. Constituency 1 covers the Mueang District except Tambon Makhuea Chae; Constituency 2 the districts Pa Sang, Mae Tha, and &quot;Tambon&quot; Makhuea Chae of Mueang District; and Constituency 3 the districts Ban Hong, Thung Hua Chang, and Li.

===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Lamphun Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 40 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Lamphun has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further there are 39 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 17 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="280570" wikidata="Q157205" url="?curid=280570" title="British Midland International">
<text>British Midland Airways Limited (trading at various times throughout its history as British Midland, bmi British Midland, bmi or British Midland International) was an airline in the United Kingdom with its head office in Donington Hall in Castle Donington, close to East Midlands Airport, England. The airline flew to destinations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America and Central Asia from its main hub at London Heathrow Airport, where at its peak it held about 13% of all takeoff and landing slots and operated over 2,000 flights a week. BMI was a member of Star Alliance from 1 July 2000 until 20 April 2012.

BMI was acquired from Lufthansa by International Airlines Group (IAG) on 20 April 2012, and was integrated into British Airways (BA) by 27 October 2012. BMI&#x27;s subsidiaries Bmibaby and BMI Regional were also purchased, although IAG did not wish to retain either. BMI Regional was sold to Sector Aviation Holdings in May 2012 and operated under the &quot;flybmi&quot; brand until it went into administration on 16 February 2019, whereas Bmibaby closed down in September 2012.

British Midland Airways Limited held a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

==History==

===Origins===
The airline dates back to 1938, when Captain Roy Harben established Air Schools Limited as a school for training pilots of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Harben had been approached by the Derby Corporation to run a new aerodrome under construction near Burnaston, which was planned to eventually become an airport. Sir Kingsley Wood, the Secretary of State for Air, officially opened the aerodrome as Derby Municipal Airport on 17 June 1939. Military flying training continued at the airport throughout the war.
Air Schools Limited formed a parent company, Derby Aviation Limited, in 1946, and Harben died the following year of a heart attack. His wife remained the controlling shareholder of the business and asked E. W. Phillips, who had been involved in running the flying school with Captain Harben, to become the new managing director. The new parent company also incorporated Wolverhampton Aviation, based at Pendeford, which offered &quot;ad hoc&quot; charter and freight flights with de Havilland Dragon Rapides, as well as aircraft maintenance and brokerage.

In 1953, Derby Aviation ceased flying training, following the award of a licence to operate scheduled flights from Burnaston and Wolverhampton to Jersey. Flights in each direction were required to land at Elmdon Airport in Birmingham to allow passengers to clear customs. The first flight was made on 18 July 1953, using a Dragon Rapide. The following year, Wolverhampton Aviation was merged into Derby Aviation, and, in 1955, the company purchased its first Douglas DC-3, a converted former military transport.

International services to Ostend commenced in 1956, and flights carrying holidaymakers from the UK to mainland Europe began as well. The company was also contracted by Rolls-Royce to transport aero engines to customers all over the world. In 1959, Derby Aviation formed Derby Airways as its airline business and introduced a new livery incorporating the new airline&#x27;s name. Domestic scheduled flights within the United Kingdom began the same year.

===British Midland Airways===
====1960s and 70s====
On 1 October 1964, after buying the Manchester Airport-based scheduled and charter airline Mercury Airlines, the company changed its name to British Midland Airways (BMA) and moved operations from Burnaston to the recently opened East Midlands Airport. The corporate colours of blue and white were adopted at that time, along with the first turboprop aircraft, a Handley Page Dart Herald.
Minster Assets, a London-based investment and banking group, acquired the airline in 1968, and in 1969 promoted former Mercury ground handling manager Michael Bishop to become the company&#x27;s general manager. From this point, Bishop drove the company forward, with domestic and European expansion continuing apace. As a first step, in November 1969, BMA took over Autair&#x27;s Heathrow–Teesside route, which marked the airline&#x27;s Heathrow debut.

In 1970, BMA entered the jet age with the introduction of three new BAC One-Eleven 500s, followed by an ex-Pan Am Boeing 707-321 in 1971. The former had been intended to be primarily used on European inclusive tour (IT) charters while the latter was to be mainly used on transatlantic &quot;affinity group&quot; charters. Also in 1970, BMA became the first British airline independent from government-owned corporations to employ UK-based, non-White cabin crew.
Following his appointment as managing director in 1972, Bishop withdrew the One-Elevens from service, two of which were swapped for three Handley Page Dart Heralds while the third was subsequently leased to Court Line. As the early-model, high-time second-hand 707s commanded a low resale value, the airline decided to keep these aircraft and lease them out to other airlines on a wet lease basis, beginning in November 1972 with a £3.3 million, two-year contract to operate Sudan Airways&#x27; &quot;Blue Nile&quot; service between Khartoum and London. The decision to pull out of both the IT and &quot;affinity group&quot; markets was taken to reverse heavy losses BMA had incurred on these charter operations due to its lack of scale and lack of vertical integration with a tour operator, which put it at a commercial disadvantage vis-à-vis the competition, as well as uneconomical charter rates as a result of overcapacity. This resulted in BMA concentrating on regional, short-haul scheduled services and &quot;ad hoc&quot; charters using turboprops such as the Herald and Viscount as these were more economical than contemporary jets on short, thin routes. The success of the airline&#x27;s wet lease operation resulted in an increase in the number of Boeing 707s allocated to this activity, including the addition of several later model 707-320B and -320C aircraft from 1976. All of these were leased to other operators, with none operating for BMA on scheduled or charter services until 1981.

On 1 November 1974, BMA began operating between London Gatwick and Belfast, where it replaced the service previously operated by British Caledonian. London–Belfast was BMA&#x27;s first UK domestic trunk route and the first all-year round route it served in [indirect] competition with British Airways (BA). BMA&#x27;s Gatwick debut also made it the only airline at the time to operate scheduled services from all five contemporary London airports – Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton, Southend and Stansted.

In January 1975, an agreement was reached for BMA to provide two Vickers Viscounts in Cyprus Airways livery to link Athens with Cyprus. A former WWII airfield at Larnaca was selected to serve the south of the island, following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The first flights departed Larnaca on 10 February 1975. On 4 April 1975, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; chartered a BMA Boeing 707 to assist the &quot;Project Vietnam Orphans&quot; and &quot;The Ockenden Venture&quot; charities in evacuating 150 orphaned children from Saigon during the Vietnam War.
On 1 September 1976, jets began gradually replacing the turboprop fleet on most of BMA&#x27;s domestic and European services, when the airline&#x27;s first Douglas DC-9 (a second-hand -15 leased from the manufacturer) replaced Viscounts on the Heathrow–Tesside route.

In 1978, Minster Assets sought to sell the company. With the help of a Californian entrepreneur, Robert F. Beauchamp, Bishop raised £2.5 million to lead the management buy-out, and was appointed chairman as a result, afterwards stating &quot;I had to borrow the money from an American citizen. Most venture capitalists want a return of 40% to make up for all their other failures and they want an exit strategy.&quot; That year, British Midland and British Airways agreed to swap some of their routes, resulting in BMA relinquishing its routes from Birmingham to Brussels and Frankfurt, and BA handing over its routes from Liverpool to London Heathrow, Belfast, Dublin, Jersey, the Isle of Man and Glasgow. Annual passenger numbers topped 1 million for the first time in 1979.
====1980s and 90s====
On 31 March 1980, British Midland replaced British Airways on the Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow route, initially operating with their remaining Viscount 800 aircraft. Within a year or two these were replaced by the DC9 15, and following the extension of the runway at Leeds Bradford, the DC9 32 became the standard equipment on the route supplemented by the 15 series and at weekends the occasional Viscount, Fokker F27 or BAE ATP turbo prop. In 1986 however, British Midland leased a BAC1-11 400 (G-WLAD) from Airways International Cymru, and this aircraft was mainly used on the Heathrow route in lieu of the usual DC9s which returned in 1987. In the following years, British Midland increased its operations from Leeds Bradford, and introduced other routes including Glasgow, Paris CDG and Brussels. When the DC9s were phased out, the Boeing 737 200 became a regular on the Heathrow route, and later the 737 300, 400, and 500 were all operated prior to the arrival of the newly acquired Fokker 100, which again was supplemented on quieter rotations by the smaller Fokker 70. Eventually the Airbus A319 became the standard equipment to Heathrow, but busier rotations saw the larger A320 and occasional A321 too. At its peak, British Midland operated up to 6 flights each way to and from Heathrow from Leeds Bradford, the final late-evening flight being operated on a smaller Embraer 145 Regional Jet. In 2009 the airline dropped the route, which they had operated unbroken for 29 years.

In 1981, the CAA turned down BMA&#x27;s application to fly between Heathrow, Glasgow and Edinburgh, but the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry upheld the airline&#x27;s appeal against the CAA&#x27;s ruling. The decision to overturn the CAA&#x27;s ruling enabled the airline to commence its first domestic trunk route from the UK&#x27;s premier airport on 25 October 1982, when it launched six daily return flights between Heathrow and Glasgow operated with DC-9s. Although these flights were not as frequent as the competing hourly BA shuttle, BMA offered keener fares and a full in-flight service (compared with the no frills shuttle). Following BMA&#x27;s success on the Heathrow–Glasgow route, the airline began flying between Heathrow and Edinburgh (1983) and Heathrow and Belfast (1984). With the introduction of these services, BMA and BA were now in direct competition on the UK&#x27;s three busiest domestic trunk routes. BMA&#x27;s competitive pressure on BA resulted in the latter replacing its no frills shuttle service with an upgraded &quot;Super Shuttle&quot; that included a full breakfast, hot drinks and a free bar service on both Heathrow–Glasgow and Heathrow–Edinburgh from September 1983. (BA subsequently extended &quot;Super Shuttle&quot; to Heathrow–Belfast as well following the launch of BMA&#x27;s competing service in 1984, in turn resulting in BMA abandoning Gatwick–Belfast which was taken over by Dan-Air.)

Also in 1982, BMA, together with British &amp; Commonwealth (the owners of AirUK at the time), formed Manx Airlines, and the following year it purchased a 75% stake in Glasgow-based regional airline Loganair from The Royal Bank of Scotland.

In October 1984, the Boeing 707 fleet was withdrawn, having been used extensively on lease operations for other airlines across the world.

In 1985, a new aircraft livery featuring a dark blue upper half and tail, with a light grey lower half separated by a thin, white stripe, was introduced. At this time, BMA was branded simply &quot;British Midland&quot;, and a new logo featuring a stylised red &quot;BM&quot; crowned with a white diamond shape appeared on aircraft tailfins. This livery subsequently featured a darker blue upper half and tail, with a deep grey lower half separated by two thin stripes, very dark blue at the top and red at the bottom. However, the logo on the aircraft&#x27;s fins remained unchanged.

The conclusion of the first fully liberalised bilateral air transport agreement in Europe between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 1985, as well as a legal technicality exempting the airline from the &quot;London [Air] Traffic Distribution Rules&quot; (a government policy that sought to compel all airlines that were planning to operate an international scheduled service to or from Heathrow for the first time to use Gatwick instead) as a result of having operated a Heathrow–Strasbourg scheduled service prior to this policy coming into effect on 1 April 1978, enabled BMA to compete directly with BA between Heathrow and Amsterdam from 29 June 1986. This resulted in BMA becoming the first private, independent airline to compete with then wholly government-owned BA on an international trunk route from Heathrow.

The &quot;Diamond Club&quot; frequent flyer programme (FFP) launched on 1 October 1987, coinciding with the introduction of an enhanced business class style, single-class &quot;Diamond Service&quot; featuring a full meal and free onboard drinks service for all passengers, regardless of the fare paid, as well as airport lounges at the airline&#x27;s major UK destinations. These service enhancements helped increase British Midland&#x27;s market share on the main London–Scotland and London–Northern Ireland trunk routes to 30%. All aircraft in the fleet were named after diamonds, beginning with a DC-9 named &quot;The Tiffany Diamond&quot;, unveiled by Rosamond Monckton, the managing director of Tiffany&#x27;s in London. The company slogan was &quot;Better for Business&quot; (2009–2010).
In March 1987, Airlines of Britain Holdings (ABH) was formed to act as a holding company for British Midland Airways and British Midland Aviation Services.

British Midland operated its final Viscount flight on 20 February 1988, 21 years after the airline had first operated the type. That year, British Midland also became the first to operate the British Aerospace (BAe) ATP for which it had been the launch customer. The BAe ATP was the airline&#x27;s last turboprop type.

In 1992, British Midland became the first airline to offer a vegetarian choice of in-flight meals on UK domestic flights and one of the first in Europe to do so on domestic services. The following year, the airline introduced &quot;Diamond EuroClass&quot; on its European routes, the first time it had offered a separate cabin for business travellers. Initially, &quot;Diamond EuroClass&quot; was competitively priced, with the highest fares being the same as rivals&#x27; published economy class fares.

On 30 September 1996, British Midland began offering &quot;Diamond EuroClass&quot; on all its domestic routes, becoming the second airline in the UK after Jersey European Airways (which had pioneered business class on UK domestic routes in 1993) to offer a separate cabin for business travellers on domestic routes and the first to do so on domestic trunk routes from Heathrow.

ABH became British Midland Plc in 1997, when it was de-merged as part of major corporate restructuring. Towards the end of the 1990s, British Midland switched its aircraft suppliers from Boeing and Fokker to Airbus and Embraer, selecting A319/320/321s and ERJ 135/145s to replace 737s and F70/100s. In July 1999, Bishop formally opened the British Midland Training Centre in Stockley Close. That year, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), a shareholder in British Midland since 1987, sold half its stake to Lufthansa followed by British Midland joining Star Alliance (in 2000).

===BMI===

Following research that had established that people in the UK tended to confuse British Midland with the Midland Bank or British Airways and that many outside the UK could not relate to the term &quot;Midland&quot;, it launched a new corporate identity in 2001, rebranding the airline as &quot;BMI British Midland&quot; (subsequently shortened to &quot;BMI&quot;). Aircraft received a new livery of royal blue, white and a fading Union flag on the tail, along with the new lower case &quot;BMI&quot; logotype. Also in 2001, BMI introduced the Airbus A330-200, its first widebodied aircraft type, into the fleet to enable it to serve the United States and other long-haul destinations. Bilateral restrictions implemented in the 1977 Bermuda II agreement meant the airline could neither fly its own aircraft to the US from its main base at Heathrow nor sell tickets on codeshare flights operated by Star Alliance partner United Airlines from the airport, as had been planned. Instead, it launched flights from Manchester to Washington Dulles and Chicago O&#x27;Hare in May and June 2001 respectively. Initially, the new A330s operated both routes; however, the Washington service was subsequently downgraded to a narrowbody operation using a Boeing 757-200 leased from Icelandair before being axed in 2005.

The airline carried 7.5 million passengers during 2002. By 2005, the total had risen to 10.1 million, the third highest of any UK airline. In early 2006, the Association of European Airlines (AEA) reported a drop in passengers carried and load factor for BMI mainline and regional services (excluding Bmibaby) whilst reporting increased loads for other AEA members over the same period.
BMI operated a service to Mumbai from London Heathrow between May 2005 and October 2006, after the UK and India amended their bilateral air services agreement. Services to Riyadh followed, commencing on 1 September 2005, after British Airways ceased to serve Saudi Arabia earlier that year. BMI also launched a scheduled service to Moscow Domodedevo in co-operation with Transaero Airlines on 29 October 2006, which used a dedicated A320 aircraft (G-MIDO) with special seating for the service, including leather seats and a 40&quot; seat pitch. In 2007 the airline launched non-stop services from its Heathrow hub to Cairo and Amman, raising the airline&#x27;s profile in the Middle East significantly. BMI announced on 5 November 2008 that it would end all longhaul operations from Manchester Airport. The two Airbus A330 aircraft based there were moved to Heathrow.

In February 2007, BMI bought British Mediterranean Airways (BMED), a British Airways franchise partner, and as a result gained access to new markets in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia that were served by that carrier. As a condition of the sale, BMI sold BMED&#x27;s Heathrow slots to British Airways for £30 million. BMED was fully integrated into BMI on 28 October 2007.

The decision by the European Commission (EC) in 2008 to accord secondary slot trading by European airlines – the practice of buying and selling take-off and landing slots at congested airports – legal recognition resulted in BMI valuing its Heathrow slot holding at £770 million. Its first-time inclusion in BMI&#x27;s 2007 annual report also resulted in a huge boost to the airline&#x27;s net asset value, which stood at only £12 million the year before. It can therefore be argued that the EC&#x27;s decision to legalise this practice made BMI an attractive takeover target for other Heathrow-based airlines and helped it avert bankruptcy.

In November 2009, following the complete takeover of BMI by Lufthansa, the airline announced a restructuring of its mainline and regional operations in an effort to suspend loss-making routes and adjust capacity. The measures included a fleet reduction of nine aircraft from the mainline fleet (two of which were operated by BMI Regional) and the suspension of routes from London Heathrow to Amsterdam, Brussels, Tel Aviv, Kyiv and Aleppo in 2010. Seasonal routes from London Heathrow to Palma and Venice were also discontinued. It was said that the restructuring could result in the loss of around 600 jobs – around 13% of the airline&#x27;s workforce.

On 12 January 2010, BMI announced that the number of daily flights between Dublin and London Heathrow would be reduced from 28 March from six to four due to the economic climate, which depressed consumer demand. This resulted in the closure of the Dublin base, which consisted of one plane and 33 cabin crew.

In April 2010, the airline announced it would begin using the &quot;British Midland International&quot; name, whilst retaining the &quot;BMI&quot; logo and continuing to be known by those initials in the domestic market. The decision to revert to the old British Midland name and to spell out for the first time what the I in BMI was supposed to stand for was taken in response to research showing that for passengers based in the Middle East, who accounted for a significant number of the airline&#x27;s premium bookings, BMI did not mean anything, and that these people preferred a name with the word &quot;British&quot; in it.

Following increasing heavy losses that exceeded £100 million per year by 2012, BMI decided to stop offering business class on domestic flights and introduce a number of new, longer range international scheduled services from Heathrow to ensure the most profitable use of its highly prized (and sought-after) slots at the severely capacity-constrained airport. This entailed aircraft downsizing (replacing Airbus mainline jets with Embraer regional jets), frequency reductions and route cutbacks on the airline&#x27;s loss-making short-haul routes from the airport, including axing its by then heavily loss-making Heathrow–Glasgow route from 27 March 2011. The decision to exit the Heathrow–Glasgow market after almost 30 years&#x27; continuous operation was blamed on a big rise in the fees BAA levied on domestic passengers at Heathrow, which had resulted in unsustainable losses of £1 million per month.

BMI&#x27;s last-ever commercial flight using a &quot;BD&quot;-prefixed flight number touched down at London Heathrow on 27 October 2012. It was operated by Airbus A321-231 G-MEDF.

In September 2023, the company re-appeared on social media, on platforms Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) with the statement: &quot;We&#x27;re preparing to usher in a new era for the iconic bmi British Midland brand. We&#x27;re building on 85 years of iconic British history, and we cannot wait to welcome you on board. For media enquiries, please contact us at media@jetbmi.co.uk&quot;. As the company is using a new web domain and new social media handles, the future identity of British Midland is unknown, and whether or not the &quot;jet&quot; phrase will be incorporated.

==Corporate affairs==

===Overview===
The airline had its head office at Donington Hall in Castle Donington in North West Leicestershire, near Derby. The airline&#x27;s head office was previously at 78 Buckingham Gate in the City of Westminster, London (until 1982). In 2011, BMI employed 527 staff at Donington Hall. In 2012, International Airlines Group announced that it may lay off up to 1,200 BMI employees, with proposed layoffs mainly from the head office.

BMI also operated a flight training centre in the Stockley Close Industrial Estate in West Drayton, London Borough of Hillingdon, near London Heathrow Airport. The centre opened in 1999 and BMI had a 50-year lease on the property running from 25 March 1999 to 24 March 2049.

===Ownership===
In 1999, SAS sold half of its 40% stake in British Midland to Lufthansa, which was seeking a stronger position at London Heathrow, following which British Midland joined Star Alliance. At the time, British Midland chairman Sir Michael Bishop owned a 50% share of the company. Between 1999 and 2004, Lufthansa sought to sell some or all of its share in the airline. Virgin Atlantic hoped to buy the shares to then merge both airlines, as BMI was already Virgin&#x27;s preferred feeder airline into Heathrow. Virgin argued that the merger would have brought together two airlines with combined ticket sales of more than £2 billion, forming a powerful force in the aviation industry. BMI was believed to have initiated the talks after it began losing money following the 11 September 2001 attacks. A merger would have strengthened Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s base at Heathrow, where BMI had hundreds of highly valued take-off and landing slots, to increase the competition with British Airways.

The two airlines combined would have had 17% of Heathrow slots against British Airways&#x27; 43%. Worried about the increased competition it would face if such a merger went ahead, British Airways considered the takeover of either BMI or Virgin Atlantic to stop the merger. British Airways concluded it would be easier to take over the financially weaker and less high-profile BMI. However, in 2004 talks of any merger of the three airlines ended. In late 2006, the airline again dismissed renewed speculation that Virgin Atlantic was preparing to make a bid to acquire full control of BMI, despite Sir Richard Branson repeating in a radio interview that such a merger would be a logical business move.

In June 2007, SAS announced that it would sell its 20% stake to improve its own group profits. The airline commented that it was in early discussions with Lufthansa as a potential buyer. In October 2008 Lufthansa announced it would be taking over BMI by purchasing the 50% shareholding of Sir Michael Bishop to consolidate with the 30% share it already owned.

The European antitrust body approved the takeover on 14 May 2009, allowing Lufthansa to become the majority stakeholder. Due to landing rights issues, the stake would be tentatively held by a Lufthansa-controlled but British-based company, LHBD Holding. Once new bilateral agreements were in place, Lufthansa would take direct control. In June 2009 it was announced that Lufthansa would buy the remaining stake in the airline from Bishop for less than originally agreed upon.

===Sale to International Airlines Group===
Lufthansa announced in September 2011 that it planned to sell BMI following continued losses. Virgin Atlantic were mooted to be considering an offer; but in early November British Airways&#x27; parent company, International Airlines Group, announced an agreement in principle to purchase the airline. Virgin Atlantic confirmed on 12 December 2011 that it had also made an offer for BMI and signed an agreement in late November to allow them to conduct due diligence on the airline. The bid amount of around £50 million was half that offered by IAG; Virgin hoped that a quick sale due to fewer potential regulatory issues would convince Lufthansa to sell to Virgin.

On 22 December 2011, IAG confirmed it had entered a contract to buy BMI from Lufthansa for £172.5 million. This would increase IAG&#x27;s share of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow from 45% to 53%. Branson pledged to fight the deal, urging European competition authorities to intervene. The deal included the option for Lufthansa to sell BMI Regional and Bmibaby separately, as they are not required by IAG; the deal price would be lowered should Bmibaby not be sold in time. Under the agreed contract, Lufthansa would continue to be responsible for the BMI pension scheme after the sale was completed, although following rejection by the pension regulator, it is now to enter the Pension Protection Fund.

On 30 March 2012, the sale of BMI was approved, conditional on giving up control of 14 daily slots at London Heathrow. Twelve of these were required to change hands completely while the remaining two could continue be part of the airline&#x27;s slot portfolio but needed to be leased out. The twelve slots eventually went to Virgin Atlantic, who subsequently used them to set up its UK domestic operation operating out of BMI&#x27;s old domestic base at Heathrow Terminal 1. BMI&#x27;s ownership transferred to IAG at 23:59 on 19 April 2012. The airline left Star Alliance, but membership benefits for both Star Alliance and BMI&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Club&quot; continued until 31 May 2012.

The &quot;Diamond Club&quot; FFP continues for members with a BMI credit card, who earn points from their spend which can be converted to Avios, the currency of BA&#x27;s FFP, Executive Club, on a 1:1 ratio. All other members were required to transfer to British Airways&#x27; &quot;Executive Club&quot; FFP.

British Midland Airways Limited continues to exist as a company, registered at British Airways&#x27; head office at Waterside in Harmondsworth, as of August 2017.

===Subsidiaries===

In 2002, BMI set up a low-cost subsidiary, Bmibaby, using Boeing 737s which were displaced after BMI&#x27;s fleet renewal programme favoured an all-Airbus fleet. Bmibaby flew routes between major and secondary airports around Europe from its bases at East Midlands Airport, Manchester Airport and Birmingham Airport until it was closed down by IAG in September 2012.

The airline also operated a regional subsidiary named BMI Regional, headquartered in Aberdeen. An agreement to sell the airline to the Scottish-based consortium Sector Aviation Holdings was reached in May 2012 and was completed on 1 June 2012. BMI Regional continued to operate regional services for BMI until 27 October 2012, when it began operations as an independent airline.

===Business trends===
The key trends for BMI over its later years are shown below (figures as at year ending 31 December, and include Bmibaby):
Financial data was reported in pounds sterling, and then in euros, because BMI was fully consolidated into the Lufthansa group of airlines on 1 July 2009.

==Destinations==
===Codeshare agreements===
Throughout its existence, BMI had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===

Following the sale of BMI to IAG, the airline&#x27;s fleet began to be transferred to British Airways. All aircraft were transferred and repainted in the BA livery, excluding its three Airbus A330s which were returned to the lessors. At its peak prior to the commencement of licensing transfers, the fleet consisted of the following aircraft registered with the Civil Aviation Authority:

===Former fleet===

BMI formerly operated the following:

==Services==
===In-flight service===
On flights from London Heathrow within the UK and to Ireland, economy class passengers had a selection of food items available for purchase; flexible economy class passengers were offered complimentary snacks and drinks. On European flights and services to Tripoli, Tunisia and Morocco, a two-class in-flight service was in place, with a hot three course meal for the business cabin and complimentary food and drinks served in the economy cabin. On mid-haul and the Freetown route, a two-class in-flight service was also in place. The business cabin was served a three course meal and was provided in-flight entertainment. A hot meal and complimentary drinks were served in the economy cabin. On A330 services to Saudi Arabia and Israel (until 2010), business, premium economy (only on board the flights to Israel) and economy cabins were available, each provided with complimentary drinks and food.

===Frequent flyer programme===
&quot;Diamond Club&quot; was the frequent-flyer programme of BMI, with three membership levels: Blue, Silver and Gold.

On sale to IAG, and being integrated into British Airways, Diamond Club members were offered a status match - BMI Gold to BA Gold, BMI Silver to BA Silver and BMI Blue to BA Blue (BA&#x27;s base level). At the time of transfer, BA did not offer a lifetime status, so members who held BMI Lifetime Gold having qualified for 10 years in succession were only matched to BA Gold and were required to re-qualify every year to maintain that status level.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 7 October 1961, Derby Aviation Douglas C-47B Dakota G-AMSW crashed into Mont Canigou in the French Pyrenees whilst operating a charter flight from Gatwick to Perpignan. All 34 passengers and crew were killed. 

* The Stockport Air Disaster: a Canadair C-4 aircraft owned by British Midland Airways (registration G-ALHG) operating a holiday charter flight crashed near the centre of Stockport, Greater Manchester, on 4 June 1967. This accident, the deadliest in the airline&#x27;s history, killed 72 of the 84 on board and seriously injured the 12 survivors; it also resulted in withdrawal of the type from the airline&#x27;s fleet.
* On 20 February 1969, a Vickers Viscount (registration G-AODG) was damaged beyond economic repair when it landed short of the runway at East Midlands Airport. There were no casualties.
* On 20 March 1969, a Vickers Viscount (registration G-AVJA) crashed on takeoff at Ringway Airport, Manchester. Three of the four crew members on board were killed.
* On 22 January 1970, a Vickers Viscount (registration G-AWXI) was damaged beyond economic repair at London Heathrow Airport when an engine caught fire on takeoff. A successful emergency landing was made at Heathrow.
* On 18 January 1987, a Fokker F27 Friendship (registration G-BMAU) on a training flight crashed on approach to East Midlands Airport due to wing and tail surface icing. There were no fatalities.
* The Kegworth air disaster: on 8 January 1989, British Midland flight BD 092, a recently delivered Boeing 737-400 (registration G-OBME), crashed onto the embankment of the M1 motorway just short of the runway of East Midlands Airport, Leicestershire. Forty-seven of the 118 passengers lost their lives.
* On 24 August 2010, an Airbus A321-231 (registration G-MEDJ) en route from Khartoum to Beirut as flight BD996 suffered a serious electrical malfunction which caused the intermittent failure of the captain and co-pilot&#x27;s electronic displays together with the uncommanded application of left rudder trim. The latter caused the aircraft to stray 20 nautical miles off course. The aircraft was cruising at 36,000 ft at the time, with both autopilot and autothrust engaged. The captain ultimately disengaged both and flew the aircraft manually, landing in Beirut without further mishap. Airbus indicated that an electrical power interruption had occurred which had caused a reset of the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). Such an event may cause a small incremental offset of the rudder trim, according to the aircraft manufacturer. The Air Accidents Investigations Board (AAIB) subsequently issued Safety Recommendation 2010–092, recommending that Airbus alert all operators of A320 series aircraft of the possibility that an electrical malfunction may not be clearly annunciated on the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring system (ECAM) and that such an event may lead to an uncommanded input of rudder trim.

<text>A numerical digit (often shortened to just digit) or numeral is a single symbol used alone (such as &quot;1&quot;), or in combinations (such as &quot;15&quot;), to represent numbers in positional notation, such as the common base 10. The name &quot;digit&quot; originates from the Latin &quot;digiti&quot; meaning fingers.

For any numeral system with an integer base, the number of different digits required is the absolute value of the base. For example, decimal (base 10) requires ten digits (0 to 9), and binary (base 2) requires only two digits (0 and 1). Bases greater than 10 require more than 10 digits, for instance hexadecimal (base 16) requires 16 digits (usually 0 to 9 and A to F).

==Overview==
In a basic digital system, a numeral is a sequence of digits, which may be of arbitrary length. Each position in the sequence has a place value, and each digit has a value. The value of the numeral is computed by multiplying each digit in the sequence by its place value, and summing the results.

===Digital values===
Each digit in a number system represents an integer. For example, in decimal the digit &quot;1&quot; represents the integer one, and in the hexadecimal system, the letter &quot;A&quot; represents the number ten. A positional number system has one unique digit for each integer from zero up to, but not including, the radix of the number system.

Thus in the positional decimal system, the numbers 0 to 9 can be expressed using their respective numerals &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot; in the rightmost &quot;units&quot; position. The number 12 is expressed with the numeral &quot;2&quot; in the units position, and with the numeral &quot;1&quot; in the &quot;tens&quot; position, to the left of the &quot;2&quot; while the number 312 is expressed with three numerals: &quot;3&quot; in the &quot;hundreds&quot; position, &quot;1&quot; in the &quot;tens&quot; position, and &quot;2&quot; in the &quot;units&quot; position.

===Computation of place values===
The decimal numeral system uses a decimal separator, commonly a period in English, or a comma in other European languages, to denote the &quot;ones place&quot; or &quot;units place&quot;, which has a place value one. Each successive place to the left of this has a place value equal to the place value of the previous digit times the base. Similarly, each successive place to the right of the separator has a place value equal to the place value of the previous digit divided by the base. For example, in the numeral 10.34 (written in base 10),
:the 0 is immediately to the left of the separator, so it is in the ones or units place, and is called the &quot;units digit&quot; or &quot;ones digit&quot;;
:the 1 to the left of the ones place is in the tens place, and is called the &quot;tens digit&quot;;
:the 3 is to the right of the ones place, so it is in the tenths place, and is called the &quot;tenths digit&quot;;
:the 4 to the right of the tenths place is in the hundredths place, and is called the &quot;hundredths digit&quot;.

The total value of the number is 1 ten, 0 ones, 3 tenths, and 4 hundredths. The zero, which contributes no value to the number, indicates that the 1 is in the tens place rather than the ones place.

The place value of any given digit in a numeral can be given by a simple calculation, which in itself is a complement to the logic behind numeral systems. The calculation involves the multiplication of the given digit by the base raised by the exponent , where &quot;n&quot; represents the position of the digit from the separator; the value of &quot;n&quot; is positive (+), but this is only if the digit is to the left of the separator. And to the right, the digit is multiplied by the base raised by a negative (−) &quot;n&quot;. For example, in the number 10.34 (written in base 10),
:the 1 is second to the left of the separator, so based on calculation, its value is,

:formula_1

:formula_2

:the 4 is second to the right of the separator, so based on calculation its value is,

:formula_3

:formula_4

==History==


The first true written positional numeral system is considered to be the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. This system was established by the 7th century in India, but was not yet in its modern form because the use of the digit zero had not yet been widely accepted. Instead of a zero sometimes the digits were marked with dots to indicate their significance, or a space was used as a placeholder. The first widely acknowledged use of zero was in 876. The original numerals were very similar to the modern ones, even down to the glyphs used to represent digits.
By the 13th century, Western Arabic numerals were accepted in European mathematical circles (Fibonacci used them in his ). They began to enter common use in the 15th century. By the end of the 20th century virtually all non-computerized calculations in the world were done with Arabic numerals, which have replaced native numeral systems in most cultures.

The exact age of the Maya numerals is unclear, but it is possible that it is older than the Hindu–Arabic system. The system was vigesimal (base 20), so it has twenty digits. The Mayas used a shell symbol to represent zero. Numerals were written vertically, with the ones place at the bottom. The Mayas had no equivalent of the modern decimal separator, so their system could not represent fractions.

The Thai numeral system is identical to the Hindu–Arabic numeral system except for the symbols used to represent digits. The use of these digits is less common in Thailand than it once was, but they are still used alongside Arabic numerals.

The rod numerals, the written forms of counting rods once used by Chinese and Japanese mathematicians, are a decimal positional system able to represent not only zero but also negative numbers. Counting rods themselves predate the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The Suzhou numerals are variants of rod numerals.

==Modern digital systems==
===In computer science===
The binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16) systems, extensively used in computer science, all follow the conventions of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The binary system uses only the digits &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, while the octal system uses the digits from &quot;0&quot; through &quot;7&quot;. The hexadecimal system uses all the digits from the decimal system, plus the letters &quot;A&quot; through &quot;F&quot;, which represent the numbers 10 to 15 respectively. When the binary system is used, the term &quot;bit(s)&quot; is typically used as an alternative for &quot;digit(s)&quot;, being a portmanteau of the term &quot;binary digit&quot;.

===Unusual systems===
The ternary and balanced ternary systems have sometimes been used. They are both base 3 systems.

Balanced ternary is unusual in having the digit values 1, 0 and –1. Balanced ternary turns out to have some useful properties and the system has been used in the experimental Russian Setun computers.

Several authors in the last 300 years have noted a facility of positional notation that amounts to a &quot;modified&quot; decimal representation. Some advantages are cited for use of numerical digits that represent negative values. In 1840 Augustin-Louis Cauchy advocated use of signed-digit representation of numbers, and in 1928 Florian Cajori presented his collection of references for negative numerals. The concept of signed-digit representation has also been taken up in computer design.

==Digits in mathematics==
Despite the essential role of digits in describing numbers, they are relatively unimportant to modern mathematics. Nevertheless, there are a few important mathematical concepts that make use of the representation of a number as a sequence of digits.

===Digital roots===

The digital root is the single-digit number obtained by summing the digits of a given number, then summing the digits of the result, and so on until a single-digit number is obtained.

===Casting out nines===

Casting out nines is a procedure for checking arithmetic done by hand. To describe it, let formula_5 represent the digital root of formula_6, as described above. Casting out nines makes use of the fact that if formula_7, then formula_8. In the process of casting out nines, both sides of the latter equation are computed, and if they are not equal, the original addition must have been faulty.

===Repunits and repdigits===

Repunits are integers that are represented with only the digit 1. For example, 1111 (one thousand, one hundred and eleven) is a repunit. Repdigits are a generalization of repunits; they are integers represented by repeated instances of the same digit. For example, 333 is a repdigit. The primality of repunits is of interest to mathematicians.

===Palindromic numbers and Lychrel numbers===

Palindromic numbers are numbers that read the same when their digits are reversed. A Lychrel number is a positive integer that never yields a palindromic number when subjected to the iterative process of being added to itself with digits reversed. The question of whether there are any Lychrel numbers in base 10 is an open problem in recreational mathematics; the smallest candidate is 196.

==History of ancient numbers==

Counting aids, especially the use of body parts (counting on fingers), were certainly used in prehistoric times as today. There are many variations. Besides counting ten fingers, some cultures have counted knuckles, the space between fingers, and toes as well as fingers. The Oksapmin culture of New Guinea uses a system of 27 upper body locations to represent numbers.

To preserve numerical information, tallies carved in wood, bone, and stone have been used since prehistoric times. Stone age cultures, including ancient indigenous American groups, used tallies for gambling, personal services, and trade-goods.

A method of preserving numeric information in clay was invented by the Sumerians between 8000 and 3500 BC. This was done with small clay tokens of various shapes that were strung like beads on a string. Beginning about 3500 BC, clay tokens were gradually replaced by number signs impressed with a round stylus at different angles in clay tablets (originally containers for tokens) which were then baked. About 3100  BC, written numbers were dissociated from the things being counted and became abstract numerals.

Between 2700 and 2000 BC, in Sumer, the round stylus was gradually replaced by a reed stylus that was used to press wedge-shaped cuneiform signs in clay. These cuneiform number signs resembled the round number signs they replaced and retained the additive sign-value notation of the round number signs. These systems gradually converged on a common sexagesimal number system; this was a place-value system consisting of only two impressed marks, the vertical wedge and the chevron, which could also represent fractions. This sexagesimal number system was fully developed at the beginning of the Old Babylonia period (about 1950 BC) and became standard in Babylonia.

Sexagesimal numerals were a mixed radix system that retained the alternating base 10 and base 6 in a sequence of cuneiform vertical wedges and chevrons. By 1950 BC, this was a positional notation system. Sexagesimal numerals came to be widely used in commerce, but were also used in astronomical and other calculations. This system was exported from Babylonia and used throughout Mesopotamia, and by every Mediterranean nation that used standard Babylonian units of measure and counting, including the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians. Babylonian-style sexagesimal numeration is still used in modern societies to measure time (minutes per hour) and angles (degrees).

==History of modern numbers==
In China, armies and provisions were counted using modular tallies of prime numbers. Unique numbers of troops and measures of rice appear as unique combinations of these tallies. A great convenience of modular arithmetic is that it is easy to multiply. This makes use of modular arithmetic for provisions especially attractive. Conventional tallies are quite difficult to multiply and divide. In modern times modular arithmetic is sometimes used in digital signal processing.

The oldest Greek system was that of the Attic numerals, but in the 4th century BC they began to use a quasidecimal alphabetic system (see Greek numerals). Jews began using a similar system (Hebrew numerals), with the oldest examples known being coins from around 100 BC.

The Roman empire used tallies written on wax, papyrus and stone, and roughly followed the Greek custom of assigning letters to various numbers. The Roman numerals system remained in common use in Europe until positional notation came into common use in the 16th century.

The Maya of Central America used a mixed base 18 and base 20 system, possibly inherited from the Olmec, including advanced features such as positional notation and a zero. They used this system to make advanced astronomical calculations, including highly accurate calculations of the length of the solar year and the orbit of Venus.

The Incan Empire ran a large command economy using quipu, tallies made by knotting colored fibers. Knowledge of the encodings of the knots and colors was suppressed by the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century, and has not survived although simple quipu-like recording devices are still used in the Andean region.

Some authorities believe that positional arithmetic began with the wide use of counting rods in China. The earliest written positional records seem to be rod calculus results in China around 400. Zero was first used in India in the 7th century CE by Brahmagupta.

The modern positional Arabic numeral system was developed by mathematicians in India, and passed on to Muslim mathematicians, along with astronomical tables brought to Baghdad by an Indian ambassador around 773.

From India, the thriving trade between Islamic sultans and Africa carried the concept to Cairo. Arabic mathematicians extended the system to include decimal fractions, and Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī wrote an important work about it in the 9th  century. The modern Arabic numerals were introduced to Europe with the translation of this work in the 12th century in Spain and Leonardo of Pisa&#x27;s &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; of 1201. In Europe, the complete Indian system with the zero was derived from the Arabs in the 12th century.

The binary system (base 2) was propagated in the 17th century by Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz had developed the concept early in his career, and had revisited it when he reviewed a copy of the I Ching from China. Binary numbers came into common use in the 20th century because of computer applications.

<text>Lolly (born Anna Shantha Kumble (pronounced &quot;KUUM-blay, Kŭmblā&quot;); 27 June 1977, Sutton Coldfield) is an English singer, dancer and TV presenter.

==Early life==
Kumble was born to Jaiker Kumble (who emigrated from India) and Barbara in Sutton Coldfield. She has a brother Paul, and a sister Jodie. Kumble attended The Shrubbery School, Highclare School and Plantsbrook School in Sutton Coldfield. She is a graduate of the London Studio Centre.

==Career==
Kumble worked as a model before going into a pop career. Lolly arrived on the British pop music scene in 1999 with the release of her first single, &quot;Viva La Radio&quot;. She released five top 20 singles and two albums over her two-year career in music. Her real name was released one letter at a time in &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine. After quitting her record label Polydor, Lolly reverted to her real name and began TV presenting, working for the BBC on programmes such as &quot;Xchange&quot;. She also works for Nickelodeon. Kumble also acted as a stand-in for presenter Anna Williamson some Saturday and Sunday mornings on now-axed kids show &quot;Toonattik&quot; on CITV. She has had roles in West End productions of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; at the Apollo Victoria Theatre and played Priscilla Presley in &quot;Elvis&quot; at the Prince of Wales Theatre. In July 2018, her first two albums &quot;My First Album&quot; and &quot;Pick &#x27;n&#x27; Mix&quot; were released digitally. In October 2018, she released a new single, &quot;Stay Young and Beautiful&quot;, her first in 18 years. In 2020, Lolly&#x27;s follow-up single was titled &quot;Paper Rain&quot;.
===Pantomime===
Kumble has starred in a number of pantomimes, typically billed as &quot;Anna Kumble (Lolly)&quot;. In 2002, she played Tinker Bell in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Brighton. In 2004, she played the title role in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at the Derby Assembly Rooms. In 2006, Kumble starred as Alice Fitzwarren in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; at The Playhouse in Weston-super-Mare. In 2009, Kumble again starred in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; as Fairy Bowbells, this time at the Stag theatre, Kent.

In 2010, Kumble returned to &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, this time playing the role of Tiger Lily at the Lichfield Garrick Theatre. In December 2012, she appeared in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; in Weymouth. In December 2018, she appeared in &quot;Cinderella&quot; as the Fairy Godmother in Telford. She returned to Telford in December 2022, where she appeared in &quot;Snow White&quot; as the Evil Queen.

<text>The Governor of Stockholm () was the head of the Office of the Governor of Stockholm (, ÖÄ), and as such he was the highest Swedish State official overseeing the affairs in the City of Stockholm between 1634 and 1967. The Governor was the equivalent in Stockholm of a county governor elsewhere in Sweden.

The Governor was appointed by and reported to the King in Council. The Office of the Governor of Stockholm was instituted by the Instrument of Government of 1634, written by Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, which uniformly delineated the civil state administration of Sweden into Counties and the Office of the Governor of Stockholm.

While Stockholm County was established in 1714, the city itself was not included until 1968, when the Office of the Governor of Stockholm was abolished and the duties of it was handed over to the Governor of Stockholm County.

<doc id="280626" wikidata="Q209741" url="?curid=280626" title="Program music">
<text>Program music or programmatic music is a type of instrumental art music that attempts to musically render an extramusical narrative. The narrative itself might be offered to the audience through the piece&#x27;s title, or in the form of program notes, inviting imaginative correlations with the music. A well-known example is Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;. 

The genre culminates in the symphonic works of Richard Strauss that include narrations of the adventures of Don Quixote, &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;, the composer&#x27;s domestic life, and an interpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy of the Übermensch, &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;. Following Strauss, the genre declined and new works with explicitly narrative content are rare. Nevertheless the genre continues to exert an influence on film music, especially where this draws upon the techniques of 19th-century late romantic music. Similar compositional forms also exist within popular music, including the concept album and rock opera.

The term is almost exclusively applied to works in the European classical music tradition, particularly those from the Romantic music period of the 19th century, during which the concept was popular, but pieces which fit the description have long been a part of music. The term is usually reserved for purely instrumental works (pieces without singers and lyrics), and not used, for example for opera or lieder. Single-movement orchestral pieces of program music are often called symphonic poems. Absolute music, in contrast, is intended to be appreciated without any particular reference to the outside world.

==Definition==
Composers and some theorists argue that there is indeed no such thing as true &quot;absolute (&quot;ars gratia artis&quot;) music&quot; and that music always at least conveys or evokes emotions. While non-professional listeners often claim that music has meaning (to them), &quot;new&quot; musicologists, such as Susan McClary, argue that so-called &quot;abstract&quot; techniques and structures are actually highly politically and socially charged, specifically, even gendered. This may be linked to a more general argument against abstraction, such as Mark Johnson&#x27;s argument that it is, &quot;necessary...for abstract meaning...to have a bodily basis&quot;. However, a more specific definition of absolute music is: music which was composed without programmatic intent, or narrative.

More traditional listeners often reject these views sharply, asserting that music can be meaningful, as well as deeply emotional, while being essentially about itself (notes, themes, keys, and so on), and without any connection to the political and societal conflicts of our own day, but consciously associated with non-musical ideas, images, or events (poems, art works, etc.)

==16th and 17th centuries==
Composers of the Renaissance wrote a fair amount of program music, especially for the harpsichord, including works such as Martin Peerson&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the Leafe&quot; and William Byrd&#x27;s &quot;The Battell&quot;. For the latter work, the composer provided this written description of the sections: &quot;Souldiers sommons, marche of footemen, marche of horsmen, trumpetts, Irishe marche, bagpipe and the drone, flute and the droome, marche to the fighte, the battels be joyned, retreat, galliarde for the victorie.&quot;

==18th century==
In the Baroque era, Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; has poetic inscriptions in the score referring to each of the seasons, evoking spring, summer, autumn, and winter. While many cantatas by J. S. Bach contain programmatic elements, an example of outright program music is his &quot;Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother&quot;, BWV 992.

Program music was perhaps less often composed in the Classical era. At that time, perhaps more than any other, music achieved drama from its own internal resources, notably in works written in sonata form. It is thought, however, that a number of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s earlier symphonies may be program music; for example, the composer once said that one of his earlier symphonies represents &quot;a dialogue between God and the Sinner&quot;. It is not known which of his symphonies Haydn was referring to. His Symphony No. 8 also includes a movement named &quot;La tempesta&quot; that represents a storm. A minor Classical-era composer, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, wrote a series of symphonies based on Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (not to be confused with twentieth-century composer Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Six Metamorphoses after Ovid&quot;), which falls into this category. German composer Justin Heinrich Knecht&#x27;s &quot;Le portrait musical de la nature, ou Grande sinfonie (Musical Portrait of Nature or Grand Symphony)&quot; from 1784–1785 is another 18th century example, anticipating Beethoven&#x27;s Pastoral Symphony by twenty years.

==19th century==
Program music particularly flourished in the Romantic era. As it can invoke in the listener a specific experience other than sitting in front of a musician or musicians, it is related to the purely Romantic idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk describing Wagner&#x27;s Operas as a fusion of many arts (set design, choreography, poetry and so on), although it relies solely on musical aspects to illustrate a multi-faceted artistic concept such as a poem or a painting. Composers believed that the dynamics of sound that were newly possible in the Romantic orchestra of the era allowed them to focus on emotions and other intangible aspects of life much more than during the Baroque or Classical eras.

Ludwig van Beethoven felt a certain reluctance in writing program music, and said of his 1808 Symphony No. 6 (&quot;Pastoral&quot;) that the &quot;whole work can be perceived without description – it is more an expression of feelings rather than tone-painting&quot;.. Yet the work clearly contains depictions of bird calls, a babbling brook, a storm, and so on. Beethoven later returned to program music with his Piano Sonata Op. 81a, &quot;Les Adieux&quot;, which depicts the departure and return of his close friend the Archduke Rudolf.

Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; was a musical narration of a hyperbolically emotional love story, the main subject being an actress with whom he was in love at the time. Franz Liszt did provide explicit programs for many of his piano pieces and he was also the inventor of the term symphonic poem. In 1874, Modest Mussorgsky composed for piano a series of pieces describing seeing a gallery of ten of his friend&#x27;s paintings and drawings in his &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, later orchestrated by many composers including Maurice Ravel. The French composer Camille Saint-Saëns wrote many short pieces of program music which he called &quot;Tone Poems&quot;. His most famous are probably the Danse Macabre and several movements from &quot;the Carnival of the Animals&quot;. The composer Paul Dukas is perhaps best known for his tone poem &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, based on a tale from Goethe.

Possibly the most adept at musical depiction in his program music was German composer Richard Strauss. His symphonic poems include &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot; (portraying a dying man and his entry into heaven), &quot;Don Juan&quot; (based on the ancient legend of Don Juan), &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot; (based on episodes in the career of the legendary German figure Till Eulenspiegel), &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (portraying episodes in the life of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; character, Don Quixote), &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Life&quot; (which depicts episodes in the life of an unnamed hero often taken to be Strauss himself) and &quot;Symphonia Domestica&quot; (which portrays episodes in the composer&#x27;s own married life, including putting the baby to bed). Strauss is reported to have said that music can describe anything, even a teaspoon.

Another composer of programmatic music is Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, whose colorful &quot;musical pictures&quot; include &quot;Sadko&quot;, Op. 5, after the Russian Bylina, about the minstrel who sings to the Tsar of the Sea, the very famous &quot;&#x27;Scheherazade&quot;, Op. 35, after the Arabian Nights entertainments (where the heroine is depicted by a violin and whose stories include &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;) and any number of orchestral suites from his operas, including &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot; (which also contains &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;), &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;, &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of The Invisible City of Kitezh&quot;.

In Scandinavia, Sibelius explored the Kalevala legend in several tone poems, most famously in &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot;.

One of the most famous programs, because it has never been definitively identified, is the secret non-musical idea or theme – the &quot;Enigma&quot; – that underlies Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Variations on an Original Theme (Enigma)&quot; of 1899. The composer disclosed it to certain friends, but at his request they never made it public.

==20th century==
Ottorino Respighi composed a number of tone poems in the 1910s and 1920s, notably three works on different aspects of the city of Rome. Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; is another well-known example. Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; was thought for years to be abstract music, but in 1977 it was discovered that it was in fact dedicated to Hanna Fuchs-Robettin. Important leitmotifs are based on the melodic series A–B–H–F, which is their combined initials. The last movement also contains a setting of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, suppressed by the composer for publication.

==Popular music as program music==
The term &quot;program music&quot; is not generally used with regard to popular music, although some popular music does have aspects in common with program music. The tradition of purely orchestral program music is continued in pieces for jazz orchestra, most notably several pieces by Duke Ellington. Instrumental pieces in popular music often have a descriptive title which suggests that they could be categorized as program music, and several instrumental albums are completely devoted to some programmatic idea (for example, &quot;China&quot; by Vangelis or &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; by Mike Oldfield). Some of the genres of popular music are more likely than others to involve programmatic elements; these include ambient, new-age, space music, surf rock, black metal, jazz fusion, progressive rock, art rock and various genres of techno music. Bluegrass has at least one outstanding bit of program music called &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;. 

Progressive rock groups and musicians during the 1970s in particular experimented with program music, among which was Rush&#x27;s &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (1980), which shows clear influences of Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Má vlast&quot; (&quot;My Homeland&quot;) (1874–1879). In addition, Rush&#x27;s songs &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot; &quot;Red Barchetta&quot;, and &quot;YYZ&quot; also show their experimentalism with program music, as do parts of &quot;2112&quot;, particularly the discovery scene.

==In the Western canon==
===18th century===
Part of the music from the Baroque and Classical eras is absolute, as is suggested by titles which often consist simply of the type of composition, a numerical designation within the composer&#x27;s oeuvre, and its key. Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Concerto for two harpsichords in C minor, BWV 1060 and Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata in C major, K. 545 are examples of absolute music.

Some composers of the Baroque era used to design titles for their music in a fashion resembling that of Romantic program music, called the &quot;rappresentativo&quot; (representative) style. Some of the most notable examples were composed by Antonio Vivaldi – some of his violin, flute or recorder concertos bear titles inspired by human affects (&quot;Il piacere&quot; – the pleasure), occupations (&quot;La caccia&quot; – the hunting, &quot;La pastorella&quot; – the shepherdess) or, most notably, aspects of nature and meteors (&quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, &quot;La notte&quot; – the night, &quot;La tempesta di mare&quot; – the sea storm). Another well-known example is Heinrich Ignaz Biber&#x27;s &quot;Sonata representativa&quot; (for violin and continuo), which depicts various animals (the nightingale, the cuckoo, the cat) in a humoristic manner. However, a distinction may be drawn between &quot;representational&quot; music and program music properly speaking, as well as between &quot;imitation&quot; and &quot;representation. Finally, there is the question of whether a deliberate expressive character is sufficient to rank as a &quot;program&quot;.

===19th century===
Program music was quite popular during the Romantic era. Many mainstream &quot;classical&quot; works are unequivocally program music, such as Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot;, which is a musical description of ascending and descending a mountain, with 22 section titles such as &quot;Night&quot;, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;By the Waterfall&quot;, &quot;In Thicket and Underbrush on the Wrong Path&quot;, &quot;Summit&quot;, &quot;Mists Rise&quot; and &quot;Storm and Descent&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 is program music, too, with titled movements and instrumental depictions of bird calls, country dances, and a storm. His fifteenth string quartet, Opus 132, contains a middle movement titled &quot;Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart&quot; (&#x27;A Convalescent&#x27;s Holy Song of Thanksgiving to the Divinity, in the Lydian Mode&#x27;), suggesting to some auditors that the entire work can be heard as a tonal evocation of sickness and recovery.

===20th century===
During the late-nineteenth and twentieth century, the increased influence of modernism and other anti-Romantic trends contributed to a decline in esteem for program music, but audiences continued to enjoy such pieces as Arthur Honegger&#x27;s depiction of a steam locomotive in &quot;Pacific 231&quot; (1923). Indeed, Percy Grainger&#x27;s incomplete orchestral fragment &quot;Train Music&quot; employs the same function. This music for large orchestra depicts a train moving in the mountains of Italy. Heitor Villa-Lobos similarly depicted a rural steam-driven train in &quot;The Little Train of the Caipira&quot; (1930).

Indeed, an entire genre sprang up in the 1920s, particularly in the Soviet Union, of picturesque music depicting machines and factories. Well-known examples include Alexander Mosolov&#x27;s &quot;Iron Foundry&quot; (1926–27) and Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Le Pas d&#x27;acier&quot; (The Steel Step, 1926). An example from outside of the Soviet Union is George Antheil&#x27;s &quot;Ballet mécanique&quot; (1923–24).

===Opera and ballet===
Music that is composed to accompany a ballet is often program music, even when presented separately as a concert piece. Aaron Copland was amused when a listener said that when she listened to &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; she &quot;could &quot;see&quot; the Appalachians and &quot;feel&quot; Spring&quot;, the title having been a last-minute thought, but it is certainly program music. Film scores and the orchestration in operas are very often program music, and some film scores, such as Prokofiev&#x27;s music for &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, have even found a place in the classical concert repertoire.

===Programmatic music and abstract imagery===
A good deal of program music falls in between the realm of purely programmatic and purely absolute, with titles that clearly suggest an extramusical association, but no detailed story that can be followed and no musical passages that can be unequivocally identified with specific images. Examples would include Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, &quot;From the New World&quot; or Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 3, &quot;Eroica&quot;.

===Motion picture soundtrack===
Influenced by the late Romantic work of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Ottorino Respighi, Richard Strauss, and others, motion picture soundtrack took up the banner of programmatic music following the advent of &quot;talkies&quot;. Many film composers, including Paul Smith, Ennio Morricone, and John Williams (whose 1977 &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtrack redefined the symphonic movie score) have followed the programmatic model and solidified motion picture soundtrack as its own programmatic genre. Music&#x27;s power for pictorial suggestion may be said to have culminated in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1940 film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Disney gave us, too, the term Mickey Mousing, used to describe scores that mimic too obviously the movements of nature. The music of Max Steiner, for instance, often lauded for its uncanny sound-image synchronization, has also been assailed for being too &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;.

<text>Robert William Gary Moore (4 April 19526 February 2011) was a Northern Irish musician. Over the course of his career, he played in various groups and performed a range of music including blues, blues rock, hard rock, heavy metal and jazz fusion.

Influenced by Peter Green and Eric Clapton, Moore began his career in the late 1960s when he joined Skid Row, with whom he released two albums. After Moore left the group he joined Thin Lizzy, featuring his former Skid Row bandmate and frequent collaborator Phil Lynott. Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot;, which is considered his signature song. During the 1980s, he transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success. In 1990, he returned to his roots with &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot;, which became the most successful album of his career. Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time. He died on 6 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain.

Moore was often described as a virtuoso and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players. He was voted as one of the greatest guitarists of all time on respective lists by &quot;Total Guitar&quot; and &quot;Louder&quot;. Irish singer-songwriter Bob Geldof said that &quot;without question, [Moore] was one of the great Irish bluesmen&quot;. For most of his career, Moore was heavily associated with Peter Green&#x27;s famed 1959 Gibson Les Paul guitar. Later Moore was honoured by Gibson and Fender with several signature model guitars.

== Early life ==
Robert William Gary Moore was born in Belfast on 4 April 1952, the son of Winnie, a housewife, and Robert Moore, a promoter who ran the Queen&#x27;s Hall ballroom in Holywood across the Belfast Lough from Belfast. The younger Robert grew up near Stormont Estate in Ballymiscaw with his four siblings. He sang &quot;Sugartime&quot; after his father invited him onstage to sing with a showband at an event that his father had organised. It first sparked the younger Robert&#x27;s interest in music, he credits his father with starting him in music by giving him the opportunity to perform. The older Robert bought his son his first guitar, a second-hand Framus acoustic, when Moore was 10 years old.

Though left-handed, the younger Robert learned to play the instrument right-handed. Not long after, he formed his first band, The Beat Boys, who mainly performed Beatles songs. He later joined Platform Three and The Method, amongst others. Around this time, he befriended guitarist Rory Gallagher, who often performed at the same venues as him. He left Belfast for Dublin in 1968 just as The Troubles were beginning in Northern Ireland. A year later, his parents separated.

== Career ==
=== Skid Row ===
After moving to Dublin, Robert William Gary Moore joined Irish blues rock band Skid Row. At the time, the group were fronted by vocalist Phil Lynott. He and Moore soon became friends and shared a bedsit in Ballsbridge, a neighborhood in the southern part of Dublin. However, after a medical leave of absence, Lynott was asked to leave Skid Row by the band&#x27;s bassist Brush Shiels, who had taken over lead vocal duties. In 1970, Skid Row signed a recording contract with CBS Records International and released their debut album &quot;Skid&quot;, which reached number 30 on the UK Albums Chart. After the album &quot;34 Hours&quot; in 1971 and tours supporting The Allman Brothers Band and Mountain amongst others, Moore decided to leave the band. He had become frustrated by Skid Row&#x27;s &quot;limitations&quot; and opted to start a solo career. In retrospect Moore commented, &quot;Skid Row was a laugh but I don&#x27;t have really fond memories of it, because at the time I was very mixed up about what I was doing.&quot; Sebastian Bach, former frontman of the American heavy metal band Skid Row, claimed that Moore sold them the rights to the name in 1987 for a reported $35,000. Shiels contested the story in 2012 claiming he still owns the rights. Rachel Bolan of the American Skid Row also refuted the story in 2019 saying, &quot;There was never any money exchange. Snake and I went and trademarked the name, and there was no problem.&quot;

=== Thin Lizzy ===

After leaving Skid Row, Phil Lynott formed the hard rock group Thin Lizzy. After the departure of guitarist Eric Bell, Moore was recruited to help finish the band&#x27;s ongoing tour in early 1974. A 1974 performance of the song &quot;The Rocker&quot;, on the Dutch TV programme &quot;TopPop&quot;, features Moore. Moore recorded three songs with the band during this time, including &quot;Still in Love with You&quot;, which he co-wrote. The song was later included on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Nightlife&quot;. He left Thin Lizzy in April 1974. While he enjoyed his time in the band, he felt it wasn&#x27;t good for him: &quot;After a few months I was doing myself in, drinking and high on the whole thing.&quot;

In 1977, Moore rejoined Thin Lizzy for a tour of the United States after guitarist Brian Robertson injured his hand in a bar fight. After finishing the tour, Lynott asked Moore to join the band on a permanent basis, but he declined. Robertson eventually returned to the group, before leaving for good in 1978. Moore took his place once again, this time for long enough to record the album &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot;, which was released in 1979. The record was a success, being certified gold in the UK. However, he abruptly left Thin Lizzy that July in the middle of another tour. He had become fed up with the band&#x27;s increasing drug use and the effects it was having on their performance. He later said that he had no regrets about leaving the band, &quot;but maybe it was wrong the way I did it. I could&#x27;ve done it differently, I suppose. But I just had to leave.&quot; Thin Lizzy eventually disbanded in 1983 with Moore making guest appearances on the band&#x27;s farewell tour. Some of the performances were released on the live album &quot;Life&quot;.

After Lynott&#x27;s death in January 1986, Moore performed with members of Thin Lizzy at the Self Aid concert in May of that year. He joined the stage with former Thin Lizzy members again in August 2005, when a bronze statue of Lynott was unveiled in Dublin. A recording of the concert was released as &quot;One Night in Dublin: A Tribute to Phil Lynott&quot;.

=== Solo career ===
In 1973, Moore released the album &quot;Grinding Stone&quot;, which was credited to The Gary Moore Band. An eclectic mix of blues, rock and jazz, it was a commercial flop with Moore still unsure of his musical direction. Between stints in Thin Lizzy, he released his first proper solo album &quot;Back on the Streets&quot; in 1978. It spawned a hit single, &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot;, which featured Phil Lynott on lead vocals and bass. The song reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart and is considered Moore&#x27;s signature song. After leaving Thin Lizzy in 1979, Moore moved to Los Angeles where he signed a new recording contract with Jet Records, a British label. He recorded the album &quot;Dirty Fingers&quot;, which was shelved in favour of the more &quot;radio-oriented&quot; &quot;G-Force&quot; album. &quot;G-Force&quot; came out in 1980. &quot;Dirty Fingers&quot; was eventually released in Japan in 1983, followed by an international release the next year.
After moving to London and signing a new recording contract with Virgin, Moore released his second solo album &quot;Corridors of Power&quot; in 1982. While not a major success, it was the first album to feature him on lead vocals throughout as well as his first solo release to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Musically &quot;Corridors of Power&quot; featured &quot;more of a rock feel&quot;, with additional influences from AOR bands such as Journey and REO Speedwagon. The album also featured former Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice, Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray and keyboardist Tommy Eyre, who had previously played with Moore in Greg Lake&#x27;s backing band. During the supporting tour for &quot;Corridors of Power&quot;, singer John Sloman was hired to share lead vocal duties with Moore and Eyre was replaced by Don Airey. In 1984, Moore released the album &quot;Victims of the Future&quot;, which marked another musical change, this time towards hard rock and heavy metal. Neil Carter, was added for the album and he continued to push Moore in the new musical direction. For the supporting tour, they were joined by former Rainbow bassist Craig Gruber and drummer Bobby Chouinard, who were later replaced by Ozzy Osbourne bassist Bob Daisley and former Roxy Music drummer Paul Thompson, respectively.

In 1985, Moore released his fifth solo album &quot;Run for Cover&quot;, which featured guest vocals by Phil Lynott and Glenn Hughes. Moore and Lynott performed the hit single &quot;Out in the Fields&quot;, which reached the top five in both Ireland and the UK. On the back of its success, &quot;Run for Cover&quot; achieved gold certification in Sweden, as well as silver in the UK. For the album&#x27;s supporting tour, Paul Thompson was replaced by drummer Gary Ferguson. Hughes was supposed to join the band on bass, but due to his substance abuse problems, he was replaced by Bob Daisley. After Lynott&#x27;s death, Moore dedicated his sixth solo album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; to him. A blend of Celtic folk music, blues and rock, the album was another success, being certified platinum in Sweden, gold in Finland and Norway, as well as silver in the UK. The album had a hit single &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, which charted in nine countries.

For the accompanying tour, former Black Sabbath drummer Eric Singer joined Moore&#x27;s backing band. &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; was followed up by 1989&#x27;s &quot;After the War&quot;, which featured drummer Cozy Powell. However, he was replaced by Chris Slade for the supporting tour. While &quot;After the War&quot; achieved gold status in Germany and Sweden, as well as silver in the UK, Moore had grown tired of his own music. He told former Thin Lizzy guitarist Eric Bell that after listening to some of his own albums, he thought they were &quot;the biggest load of fucking shite&quot; he had ever heard. In his own words, Moore had lost his &quot;musical self‑respect&quot;.
In 1990, Moore released the album &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot;, a return to his blues roots and collaborating with Albert King, Albert Collins and George Harrison. The idea for the record came up during the supporting tour for &quot;After the War&quot;–Moore often played the blues by himself in the dressing room and one night Bob Daisley jokingly suggested that he do a whole blues album. The change in musical style was also underlined by a change in Moore&#x27;s wardrobe. He sported a smart blue suit for videos and live performances instead of being &quot;all dolled up like some guy in Def Leppard&quot;. Being a conscious decision by Moore to attract new listeners he informed his old audience that &quot;this was something new&quot;. In the end, &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot; became the most successful album of Moore&#x27;s career, selling over three million copies worldwide. The album&#x27;s title track also became the only single of his solo career to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it reached number 97 in February 1991. For the album&#x27;s supporting tour, Moore assembled a new backing band dubbed The Midnight Blues Band; it featured Andy Pyle, Graham Walker and Don Airey as well as a horn section.

&quot;Still Got the Blues&quot; was followed by 1992&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot;, which went platinum in Sweden and gold in the UK. The record also became Moore&#x27;s highest-charting album in the UK where it reached number four. In 1995, Moore released &quot;Blues for Greeny&quot;, a tribute album to his friend and mentor Peter Green. After experimenting with electronic music on &quot;Dark Days in Paradise&quot; (1997) and &quot;A Different Beat&quot; (1999), Moore once again returned to his blues roots with 2001&#x27;s &quot;Back to the Blues&quot;. &quot;Power of the Blues&quot; (2004) followed, in addition to &quot;Old New Ballads Blues&quot; (2006), &quot;Close as You Get&quot; (2007) and finally &quot;Bad for You Baby&quot; (2008). Prior to his death, he was working on a new Celtic rock album which was left unfinished. Some of the songs later appeared on the live album &quot;Live at Montreux 2010&quot;. Additional unreleased recordings of Moore&#x27;s were released on the album &quot;How Blue Can You Get&quot; in 2021.

=== Other work ===
In 1975, Moore joined progressive jazz fusion group Colosseum II, which was formed after the demise of bandleader Jon Hiseman&#x27;s previous band Colosseum. Moore recorded three albums with the group, before leaving to join Thin Lizzy in 1978. While living in Los Angeles in 1979, Moore formed the band G-Force with Glenn Hughes and Mark Nauseef. However, Hughes was soon fired due to his problems with substance abuse. The band then recruited singer Willie Dee and bassist Tony Newton. At the same time, Moore was also being courted to join Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band. He declined and G-Force helped Osbourne audition other musicians for Osbourne&#x27;s band. G-Force released their self-titled debut album in 1980 and toured opening for Whitesnake. Before the end of the year, however, the band broke up.

After G-Force, Moore was recruited to play guitar in Greg Lake&#x27;s solo band. They recorded two studio albums together, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Greg Lake&quot; and 1983&#x27;s &quot;Manoeuvres&quot;, as well as the live album &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Greg Lake in Concert&quot;, which was released in 1995. In 1982, Moore was considered for the guitarist position in Whitesnake, but vocalist David Coverdale opted not to recruit Moore as the band was in the process of severing ties with their management. In 1987, Moore collaborated on the UK charity record &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which was released under the group name Ferry Aid. From 1993 to 1994, he was a member of the short-lived power trio BBM (&quot;Baker Bruce Moore&quot;), which also featured Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, both formerly of Cream. After just one album and a European tour, the trio disbanded. The project was marred by personality clashes between members as well as &quot;ear problems&quot; which Moore sustained during the tour. He later said of the band&#x27;s break-up: &quot;There were a lot of things within the band that would have made it impossible, long term. I think that politically Jack [Bruce] was used to having his own band, I was used to having my own band and so it was very difficult.&quot; In 2002, Moore collaborated with former Skunk Anansie bassist Cass Lewis and Primal Scream drummer Darrin Mooney in Scars, which released one album. Moore performed on the One World Project charity single &quot;Grief Never Grows Old&quot;, which was released in 2005.

Over the course of his career, Moore played with many more artists including George Harrison, Dr. Strangely Strange, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Rod Argent, Gary Boyle, B.B. King, The Traveling Wilburys and The Beach Boys.

== Personal life ==
In the mid-1970s, Moore was involved in a bar fight leaving him with facial scars. According to Eric Bell, Moore was with his girlfriend at Dingwalls in Camden which is part of inner London, when two men &quot;started mouthing about Gary&#x27;s girlfriend [...] what they&#x27;d like to do to her&quot;. After Moore confronted them about it, one of the men smashed a bottle on the bar and slashed Moore&#x27;s face with it. It had a profound effect on him. Bell said, &quot;It did change him. A lot of that pent-up anger and emotion would come out in his playing... it came out in other ways too. It must be a hard thing to come back from something like that.&quot; During the 1980s, Moore hid his scars in photographs and videos by looking down or being framed in photographs from a distance.

Moore was married to his first wife Kerry from 1985 to 1993. Before divorcing, they had two sons, Jack (who became a musician) and Gus. Gary later had a daughter, Lily (who also embarked on a musical career), during a relationship with Jo Rendle. Moore also had a daughter named Saoirse from another relationship. At the time of his death, he was in a relationship.

== Death ==

During the early hours of 6 February 2011, Moore died of a heart attack in his sleep at the age of 58. At the time he was on holiday with his girlfriend at the Kempinski Hotel in Estepona, a town in Andalusia, Spain. His death was confirmed by Thin Lizzy&#x27;s manager Adam Parsons. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that his heart attack was brought on by a blood alcohol level of 0.38%, whereas a level of 0.40% is generally considered lethal and 0.08% is considered legally drunk. According to Mick Wall, a music journalist, Moore had developed a serious drinking problem during the last years of his life.

Moore was buried in a private ceremony at St Margaret&#x27;s Churchyard in Rottingdean which is in Brighton on the southern coast of England with only family and close friends in attendance. His eldest son Jack and his uncle Cliff performed the Irish ballad ‘Danny Boy’ at his funeral. It was reported in &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot; as &quot;a flawless tribute at which some mourners in the church wept openly&quot;.

== Style and influences ==
Moore was known for having an eclectic career having performed blues, hard rock, heavy metal and jazz fusion. At times he was accused of chasing trends which Moore denied; he said that he had always just done what he liked at the time. After &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot;, Moore distanced himself from his 1980s hard rock image. Although he still enjoyed rock music in general, he no longer identified himself as a rock guitarist, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m not that guy anymore, to be honest with you. If I go back and listen to some of that stuff, I go, &#x27;Shit. Did I really play that?&#x27; It just sounds quite alien to me in some ways–It&#x27;s just not the way I want to play.&quot; While he was closely associated with and cited as a heavy influence on the guitar &quot;shred&quot; movement of the 1980s, Moore himself was highly critical of many of its proponents, describing many of the artists associated with the Guitar Institute of Technology and Shrapnel Records as being part of a &quot;conveyor belt production line of guitarists who haven&#x27;t a lot to say for themselves&quot;. Many of his songs were autobiographical or they dealt with topics important to him.
One of Moore&#x27;s biggest influences was guitarist Peter Green. The first time Moore heard Green play was at a performance with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. Describing the show Moore said, &quot;It was an amazing experience just to hear a guitarist walk on stage and plug into this amplifier, which I thought was a pile of shit, and get this incredible sound. He was absolutely fantastic, everything about him was so graceful.&quot; Moore eventually met Green in January 1970 when Skid Row toured with Green&#x27;s band Fleetwood Mac. The two became friends and Green later sold his 1959 Gibson Les Paul to Moore. Another major influence of Moore&#x27;s was Eric Clapton, whom he first heard on the John Mayall &amp; The Bluesbreakers album &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot;. To Moore it was a life-changing experience, &quot;Within two seconds of the opening track, I was blown away. The guitar sound itself was so different. You could hear the blues in it, but prior to that all the guitar you heard in rock, well pop, music had been very staid, very polite. Just listen to the early Beatles and The Shadows to see what I mean. They were great, but Eric Clapton transcended it completely.&quot; Some of Moore&#x27;s other early influences were Jeff Beck, George Harrison, Jimi Hendrix, Hank Marvin, John Mayall and Mick Taylor. He also cited Albert King and B.B. King as being influential to his performances.

Moore has been described as a virtuoso by numerous publications. Don Airey described him as a genius, while guitarist Bernie Marsden said that &quot;Gary could play literally any style&quot;. Moore was known for his melodic sensibilities as well as his aggressive vibrato. During the 1980s, he often used major or natural minor scales and in the second half of his career, his playing was characterised by his use of pentatonic and blues scales. For more melodic leads, he often used the guitar&#x27;s neck pickup, while the bridge pickup was used to achieve a more aggressive sound. Regarding his style of playing, Moore said the best piece of advice he ever received came from Albert King, who taught him the value of leaving space. Moore said, &quot;When you get into the habit of leaving a space, you become a much better player for it. If you&#x27;ve got an expressive style and can express your emotions through your guitar, and you&#x27;ve got a great tone, it creates a lot of tension for the audience. It&#x27;s all down to the feel thing. If you&#x27;ve got a feel for the blues, that&#x27;s a big part of it. But you&#x27;ve got to leave that space.&quot; He was also known for having pained expressions while performing, something he said was not a conscious action. When asked about it he said, &quot;When I&#x27;m playing I get completely lost in it and I&#x27;m not even aware of what I&#x27;m doing with my face—I&#x27;m just playing.&quot;

Moore was often described as &quot;grumpy&quot; and he had a reputation of being hard to work with. Brian Downey described him as &quot;cranky&quot; at times, while Eric Bell recalled a particular incident after a concert in Dublin: &quot;I went to see him in the dressing room afterwards. — I sat down beside him and said, &#x27;Fucking great gig, Gary.&#x27; He looked at me. &#x27;What? Fucking load of shite! I&#x27;ve never played so bad in my fucking life!&#x27; I saw that side of him quite a lot.&quot; It was echoed by Downey who said that if a show was not perfect, it would torment Moore. While Moore acknowledged his reputation of being difficult to work with at times, he attributed that to his own perfectionism holding others up to the same standards he set for himself. Don Airey later said that Moore&#x27;s perfectionism was often to his own detriment.

== Legacy ==

After his death, many of Moore&#x27;s fellow musicians paid tribute to him including his former Thin Lizzy bandmates Brian Downey, and Scott Gorham, as well as Bryan Adams, Bob Geldof, Kirk Hammett, Tony Iommi, Alex Lifeson, Brian May, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Rodgers, Henry Rollins, Roger Taylor, Butch Walker, and Mikael Åkerfeldt amongst many others. Thin Lizzy also dedicated the rest of their ongoing tour to Moore. Eric Clapton performed &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot; in concert as a tribute to Moore, and the song was featured later on Clapton&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Old Sock&quot;. On 12 March 2011, a tribute night was held for Moore at Duff&#x27;s Brooklyn in New York City. On 18 April 2011, Eric Bell, Brian Downey and a number of performers gathered for a tribute concert at Whelan&#x27;s in Dublin.

In 2012, an exhibition celebrating the life and work of Moore was held at the Oh Yeah Music Centre in Belfast. To commemorate what would have been his father&#x27;s 65th birthday, Jack Moore along with guitarist Danny Young released the tribute song &quot;Phoenix&quot; in 2017. That same year, guitarist Henrik Freischlader released a tribute album to Moore, titled &quot;Blues for Gary&quot;. In 2018, Bob Daisley released the album &quot;Moore Blues for Gary – A Tribute to Gary Moore&quot;, which featured the likes of Glenn Hughes, Steve Lukather, Steve Morse, Joe Lynn Turner and Ricky Warwick. On 12 April 2019, a tribute concert for Moore was held at The Belfast Empire Music Hall to help raise funds for a memorial statue. Plans for the statue were approved by the Belfast City Council in January 2025.

Moore has been cited as an influence by many notable guitarists including Doug Aldrich, Joe Bonamassa, Vivian Campbell, Paul Gilbert, Kirk Hammett, John Norum, John Petrucci, John Sykes, and Zakk Wylde. In 2018, Moore was voted number 15 on &quot;Louder&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 Best Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In 2020, he was named on a list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; by &quot;Total Guitar&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; included him in their 2021 list of &quot;The 100 Most Influential Guitar Heroes&quot;.

Gary Moore&#x27;s official biography, written by Harry Shapiro and authorised by Moore&#x27;s estate, was released on 27 September 2022.

== Equipment ==

=== Guitars ===

The guitar most associated with Moore was a 1959 Gibson Les Paul, which was sold to him by Peter Green for around £100. The guitar is nicknamed &quot;Greeny&quot; and is known for its unusual tone, the result of a reversed neck pickup. Moore used the guitar for most of his career (most notably on &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot;), until he sold it in 2006 for $750,000 to $1.2 million. In a 2007 interview for &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot; magazine, he talked about having to sell the guitar: &quot;I didn’t want to sell it–I had to sell it for various reasons, but mainly because I injured my hand a few years ago and the insurance didn&#x27;t pay up. I canceled shows and had to cover tour costs with my own money, and didn’t get paid for any of the shows. I ended up with debt. So it was a financial thing, and that was the quickest way to do anything about it. I mean, why would I want to sell it? That guitar was played by Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck. Rory Gallagher played it, I played it… It was a very special instrument.&quot; The guitar was purchased by Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett in 2014 reportedly for &quot;less than $2 million&quot;.

On &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot;, Moore used another 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard, nicknamed &quot;Stripe&quot;, which he bought in 1989. Apart from fitting bigger fretwires and Grover tuners, the guitar was completely stock standard with original pickups and electronics. Moore used it extensively throughout the remainder of his career and by the 2000s was his &quot;main guitar&quot;. The guitar was retained by Moore&#x27;s estate following his death.

In 2000–2001, Gibson released a Gary Moore Signature Les Paul Standard with a faded lemonburst finish and a reversed neck pickup. Gibson later released a Gary Moore Signature BFG Les Paul, featuring a P-90 pickup in the neck position. In 2013, Gibson announced a new Gary Moore Signature Les Paul, modelled after the &quot;Greeny&quot; guitar. On &quot;Corridors of Power&quot; and &quot;Victims of the Future&quot;, Moore used a 1961 Fiesta Red Fender Stratocaster, which had previously belonged to Tommy Steele. In 2017, Fender Custom Shop released a limited edition replica of the guitar. During the 1980s, Moore also played Hamer and PRS guitars, as well as Charvels equipped with Floyd Rose tremolos and EMG pickups.

Other guitars Moore used during his career include a 1964 Gibson ES-335 and a 1968 Fender Telecaster. After his death, several of his guitars were auctioned off including a 1963 Fender Stratocaster given to him by Claude Nobs, a Fritz Brothers Roy Buchanan Bluesmaster, a 2011 Gibson Les Paul Standard VOS Collector&#x27;s Choice No. 1 Artist&#x27;s Proof No. 3 (modelled after the &quot;Greeny&quot; guitar) and a 1964 Gibson Firebird 1. Moore began playing with .009-.046 gauge strings, before switching to .010-.052. Later he switched to gauge .009-.048. His preferred brand of strings was Dean Markley. He also used extra-heavy picks.

=== Other equipment ===
Moore used Marshall amplifiers during most of his career. He utilised other brands from time to time as well including Dean Markley, Gallien-Krueger and Fender. Some of the effects pedals he used during the 1980s included a Boss DS-1, an Ibanez ST-9 Super Tube Screamer, a Roland Space Echo, a Roland SDE 3000 Digital Delay and a Roland Dimension D. Later he used a variety of effects by T-Rex, an Ibanez TS-10 Tube Screamer Classic and a Marshall Guv&#x27;nor; the last one was featured most notably on &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot;. In the studio, he used an Alesis Midiverb II since the late 1980s. He was an early adopter of the pedalboard, namely the Boss BCB-6 &quot;Carrying Box&quot;, which he used in the early 1980s.

<text>Ulf Adelsohn (born 4 October 1941) is a Swedish politician, leader of the Moderate Party from 1981 to 1986 and Governor of Stockholm County from 1992 to 2001. He was a member of the Riksdag from 1982 to 1988 and served as Chairman of the Board of SJ AB 2001–2011, from where he resigned due to quarrels with the Reinfeldt cabinet on its railway deregulation policies.

==Early life==
Adelsohn was born on 4 October 1941 in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of the deputy director (&quot;kansliråd&quot;) in the Ministry of Justice and his wife Margareta (née Halling). His paternal grandparents were Polish Jews and his mother was of Swedish descent. On the side of his mother, he is a descendant (great-great-great-great-grandson) of Jacob Johan Anckarström; the assassin of Gustav III who was convicted for regicide and executed.

Adelsohn studied law at Stockholm University, earning a Candidate of Law degree in 1968. Adelsohn was chairman of the Swedish Union of Conservative Students from 1966 to 1968, opposed the occupation of the Student Union Building in Stockholm in 1968 and was a co-founder of Borgerliga Studenter – Opposition &#x27;68 later in the same year.

==Career==
Adelsohn worked as ombudsman for Fastighets AB Stockholm City from 1968 to 1970, and was deputy chairman of the Moderate Party in Stockholm from 1968 to 1973. He was assistant director at Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations from 1970 to 1973, &quot;gatuborgarråd&quot; from 1973 to 1976, and Commissioner of the Finance in the Department of the Stockholm City Administration from 1976 to 1979. He served as minister of communications (transport) in the Fälldin II cabinet centre-right government from 1979 to 1981. He was leader of the Swedish Moderate Party from 1981 to 1986, the second largest party (after the dominant Social Democrats) and was thus the leader of the main opposition party in the 1985 election.

Adelsohn was a member of parliament from 1982 to 1988, and served as Governor of Stockholm County from 1992 to 2001.

Adelsohn was a member of the municipal council from 1966 to 1979, chairman of the ice hockey section of Djurgårdens IF from 1974 to 1977, a member of the Council of the Swedish Sports Federation (&quot;Riksidrottsstyrelsen&quot;) from 1977 to 1979, board member of Wasa Insurance Company from 1990 to 1992, the Swedish Tourist Council (&quot;Sveriges turistråd&quot;) from 1995 to 2000, and the Riksdag Remunerations Board (&quot;Riksdagens arvodesnämnd&quot;) from 1999. Furthermore, he was chairman of Gröna Lund from 1987 to 1991, from 1990 to 1992, &quot;Styrelsen för Sverigebilden&quot; from 1992 to 1995, Stockholm County Development Fund (&quot;Utvecklingsfonden Stockholms län&quot;) from 1992 to 1995, Stockholm Water Festival AB from 1992 to 1996, the Archipelago Foundation (&quot;Skärgårdsstiftelsen&quot;) from 1992 to 1998, the Civil Aviation Administration from 1992, the County (Regional) Employment Board in Stockholm County (&quot;Länsarbetsnämnden i Stockholms län&quot;) from 1992, Almi Stockholm from 1995, and Skansen from 1997. From 2001 to 2011 was he chairman of the board for SJ. In 2005 he decided to stand for election for Stockholm City Council again, declaring himself to be a candidate for Speaker of the Council. His candidacy was however withdrawn before the elections in 2006.

==Personal life==
In 1981, Adelsohn married the then journalist Lena Liljeroth, the daughter of Hans Liljeroth and Inger (née Arlon). Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth later served as minister for culture in the Reinfeldt cabinet. They have two children, Erik and Ebba.

An avid supporter of Djurgårdens IF, Adelsohn was at one point chairman of the club&#x27;s ice hockey department.

In 1860, during the Second Opium War in China, he ordered the destruction of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, an architectural wonder with immeasurable collections of artworks and historic antiques, inflicting incalculable loss of cultural heritage. 
Subsequently, he compelled the Qing dynasty to sign the Convention of Peking, adding Kowloon Peninsula to the British crown colony of Hong Kong.

==Early life and education==

Lord Elgin was born in London on 20 July 1811, the son of the 7th Earl of Elgin and 11th Earl of Kincardine and his second wife, Elizabeth Oswald. He shared his birthday, 20 July, with his father. He had six brothers and sisters, and three half-sisters and one half-brother from his father&#x27;s first marriage. Lord Elgin&#x27;s father was reportedly impoverished by his acquisition of the Elgin Marbles; it had cost him a large amount of money to transport them, and he sold them to the British government at a significant loss.

James Bruce was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with a first in Classics in 1832. While at Oxford, he became friends with William Ewart Gladstone.

==Career==
He was elected at the 1841 general election as a Member of Parliament for Southampton, but the election was declared void on petition. He did not stand in the resulting by-election. In November 1841, on the death of his father, he succeeded as 8th Earl of Elgin.

===Jamaica===
James Bruce became Governor of Jamaica in 1842, During an administration of four years he succeeded in winning the respect of all. He improved the condition of the Afro-Caribbean workers, and conciliated the white planters by working through them.

===Canada===

In 1847 he was appointed Governor General of the Province of Canada by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, in the administration of Lord John Russell. Under Lord Elgin, the first real attempts began at establishing responsible government in Canada. Lord Elgin became the first Governor General to distance himself from the affairs of the legislature. Since then, the Governor-General has had a largely symbolic role with regards to the political affairs of the country. As Governor-General, he wrestled with the costs of receiving high levels of immigration in the Canadas, a major issue in the constant debate about immigration during the 19th century. 

In 1849 the Baldwin-Lafontaine government passed the Rebellion Losses Bill, compensating French Canadians for losses suffered during the Rebellions of 1837. Lord Elgin granted royal assent to the bill despite heated Tory opposition and his own misgivings over how his action would be received in England. The decision sparked the Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal by an English-speaking mob. Elgin was assaulted. Instead of calling in the military, he withdrew his family to their country residence and allowed civil authorities to restore order. Due to his relations with the United States, his support of the self-government and defence of the colony, and his settlement of the free-trade and fishery questions, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Elgin in 1849.

Also in 1849, the Stony Monday Riot took place in Bytown on Monday 17 September. Tories and Reformists clashed over the planned visit of Lord Elgin, one man was killed and many sustained injuries. Two days later, the two political factions, armed with cannon, muskets and pistols faced off on the Sappers Bridge. Although the conflict was defused in time by the military, a general support for the Crown&#x27;s representative, triumphed in Bytown (renamed Ottawa by Queen Victoria in 1854). In 1854, Lord Elgin negotiated the Reciprocity Treaty with the United States in an attempt to stimulate the Canadian economy. Later that year, he granted royal assent to the law that abolished the seigneurial system in Quebec, and then resigned as Governor-General.

Elgin supported the Bagot Report, which was published in 1847 by Governor General Charles Bagot, and which is seen as the foundational document for the Canadian Indian residential school system. Elgin had been impressed by industrial schools he had seen while in the West Indies.

Soon after his return to England in 1854, Lord Palmerston offered him a seat in the cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, which he declined.

===China and Japan===

In 1857, Lord Elgin was appointed High Commissioner and Plenipotentiary in China and the Far East to assist in the process of opening up China and Japan to Western trade. During the Second Opium War, he led the bombardment of Canton (Guangzhou).

In 1858, while passing through Nanjing, Lord Elgin was presented a poetic message by Hong Xiuquan, in which the self-styled Heavenly King referred to him as &quot;our foreign younger brother of the Western Seas.&quot; Hong invited Lord Elgin to join his rebellion: &quot;Let us together serve God and our Elder Brother, and destroy the hateful insects.&quot; Lord Elgin saw the invitation as a &quot;strange document,&quot; and furthermore it would &quot;be awkward for me to have any intercourse with the rebel chiefs,&quot; he did not land.

Lord Elgin oversaw the end of the Second Opium War by signing the Treaty of Tientsin (Tianjin) on 26 June 1858.
In 1859 Chinese troops continued to attack, and Lord Russell sent out Lord Elgin as ambassador extraordinary to demand an apology for the attack, the execution of the treaty, and an indemnity for the military and naval expenditure. In June 1860, Lord Elgin arrived in China to assist with additional attacks, which were initially led by his brother. On 18 October 1860, not having received the Chinese surrender and wishing to spare the imperial capital of Peking (Beijing), he ordered the complete destruction of the Old Summer Palace (Yuanming Yuan) outside the city in retaliation for the torture and execution of almost twenty European and Indian prisoners, including two British envoys and &quot;The Times&quot; journalist Thomas Bowlby. The Old Summer Palace was a complex of palaces and gardens eight kilometres northwest of the walls of Beijing; it had been built during the 18th and early 19th centuries, and was where the emperors of the Qing dynasty resided and handled government affairs. An alternative account says that Lord Elgin had initially considered the destruction of the Forbidden City. However, fearing that this act might interfere with the signing of the Convention of Peking, which was where it was being negotiated, he opted for the destruction of the Old Summer Palace instead.

The Old Summer Palace was set ablaze by a force of Anglo-French troops. The troops hurriedly looted the imperial collections in the palace before it finished burning. Attacks on the nearby Summer Palace (Qingyi Yuan) were also made, but the extent of destruction was not as great as to the Old Summer Palace. On 24 October 1860, Lord Elgin signed the Convention of Peking, which stipulated that China was to cede part of Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong in perpetuity to Britain. According to historian Olive Checkland, Lord Elgin &quot;was ambivalent about the British imperial policy of forcing trade on the peoples in China and Japan. He deplored what he called the &#x27;commercial ruffianism&#x27; which effectively determined British policy responses.&quot; In a letter to his wife, in regard to the bombing of Canton, he wrote, &quot;I never felt so ashamed of myself in my life.&quot;

In between Lord Elgin&#x27;s two trips to China, he had visited Japan. In August 1858, he signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, whose negotiation was much eased by the recent Harris Treaty between Japan and the United States. He would also present the Tokugawa administration the HMY Emperor, a modern and luxuriously appointed steam powered yacht as a present for the Emperor from Queen Victoria to commemorate the signing of the treaty.

===India===
Within a month of Elgin&#x27;s return to England, Lord Palmerston selected him to be viceroy and governor-general of India. He became viceroy in 1862, the first viceroy directly appointed by the Crown, and as subject to the Secretary of State for India. Elgin tried to hold the Dutch in Sumatra in check, and marched a force to the Peshawar border to enforce earlier treaties.

He was the first to use Peterhoff, Shimla as the official residence of the Viceroy. In 1863, he was travelling from there to Sialkot, an arduous journey at a high elevation which exhausted him. He died in 1863 of a heart attack while crossing a swinging rope and wood bridge over the river Chadly, on the lap between Kullu and Lahul. He was buried in the churchyard of St. John in the Wilderness in Dharamshala.

==Marriage and issue==

Elgin married Elizabeth Mary Cumming-Bruce, the only child of MP Charles Lennox Cumming-Bruce, on 22 April 1841. The marriage was short lived, his wife dying shortly after the birth of their second daughter on 7 June 1843 in Jamaica. They had, along with another daughter:

*Lady Elma Bruce (1842–1923), married in 1864 the 5th Baron Thurlow.

On 7 November 1846, Elgin married Lady Mary Louisa Lambton, daughter of the 1st Earl of Durham, a prominent author of the &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)&quot; (as well as Governor General of the Canadas), and niece of the Colonial Secretary the 3rd Earl Grey (who was uncle to Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, later Governor General of Canada). They had four sons and a daughter:

*Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin (1849–1917)
*Hon. Robert Preston Bruce (1851–1893), MP for Fife and W. Fife
*Hon. Frederick John Bruce (1854–1920), Page of Honour to Queen Victoria 1869–71, married in 1879 Katherine Bruce Fernie, and had four sons and four daughters.
*Lady Louisa Elizabeth Bruce (1856–1902), unmarried

==Controversy and English-based memorials==
In Ontario, the towns of Kincardine, Port Elgin, and Bruce Mines, along with Bruce County and Elgin County are named for the 8th Earl. The long Bruce Peninsula into Lake Huron, and the communities of Elgin, New Brunswick, and Elgin, Nova Scotia, are also named for him. There are numerous Elgin Roads and Elgin Streets in Canada and in India.

The Elgin Bridge in Singapore, and Elgin Street, Carlton, State of Victoria, and Elgin Street, Hong Kong, are also named for Bruce, as is the Lord Elgin Hotel in Ottawa. 
Elgin&#x27;s legacy in Canada was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada short docudrama, &quot;Lord Elgin: Voice of the People&quot; (1959), directed by Julian Biggs.

While China has opened up to French relations, the sale of Chinese art and artifacts in British auctions remains a point of tension between London and Beijing. However, all zodiac animal heads from the Summer Palace that have been found have been returned to the Beijing Poly Museum.

<doc id="280679" wikidata="Q621412" url="?curid=280679" title="McCune–Reischauer">
<text>McCune–Reischauer romanization ( ) is one of the two most widely used Korean-language romanization systems. It was created in 1937 and the ALA-LC variant based on it is currently used for standard romanization library catalogs in North America.

The system was first published in 1939 by George M. McCune and Edwin O. Reischauer. With a few exceptions, it does not attempt to transliterate Korean hangul but rather represents the phonetic pronunciation.

A variant of McCune–Reischauer is still used as the official system in North Korea. South Korea formerly used another variant of McCune–Reischauer as its official system between 1984 and 2000, but replaced it with the Revised Romanization of Korean in 2000.

== Characteristics and usage ==
Under the McCune–Reischauer system, aspirated consonants like , , and are distinguished by apostrophes from unaspirated ones. The apostrophe is also used to distinguish from : is transcribed as while is .

The breve is used to differentiate vowels in Korean: is spelled , is , is and is .

=== Criticism ===
Because of the dual use of apostrophes—the more common being for syllabic boundaries—it can be ambiguous for persons unfamiliar with McCune–Reischauer as to how a romanized Korean word is pronounced. For example, → , which consists of the syllables , and ).

In the early days of the Internet, the apostrophe and breve were even omitted altogether for both technical and practical reasons, which made it impossible to differentiate the aspirated consonants , , and from the unaspirated consonants , , and , () from (), and the vowels and as well as from . As a result, the South Korean government adopted a revised system of romanization in 2000. However, Korean critics claimed that the Revised System fails to represent and in a way that is easily recognizable and misrepresents the way that the unaspirated consonants are actually pronounced.

Regardless of the official adoption of the new system in South Korea, North Korea continues to use a version of McCune–Reischauer.

== Guide ==
This is a simplified guide for the McCune–Reischauer system.

=== Vowels ===

=== Consonants ===

:* The heterogeneous consonant digraphs () exist only as finals and are transcribed by their actual pronunciation.

::# is an initial consonant before a vowel to indicate the absence of sound.
::# is romanized .
::# When the previous syllable ends in a vowel (for example, is romanized , not &quot;achu&quot;).
::# In Sino-Korean words, &quot;lt&quot; and &quot;lch&quot;, respectively.

For , , , and , the letters &quot;g&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;j&quot; are used if voiced, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, or &quot;ch&quot; otherwise. Pronunciations such as those take precedence over the rules in the table above.

=== Examples ===
* Voiceless/voiced consonants
** 
**

=== Personal names ===
The rules stated above are also applied in personal names, except between a surname and a given name. A surname and a given name are separated by a space, but multiple syllables within a surname or within a given name are joined without hyphens or spaces.

The original 1939 paper states the following:
The original paper also gives McCune–Reischauer romanizations for a number of other personal names:

* Footnotes on page 4: ( ())
* Footnotes on page 20: ( ()), ( ())

== Variants ==

=== North Korean variant ===

A variant of McCune–Reischauer is currently in official use in North Korea. The following are the differences between the original McCune–Reischauer and the North Korean variant:
* Aspirated consonants are represented by adding an &quot;h&quot; instead of an apostrophe.
** However, is transcribed as &quot;ch&quot;, not &quot;chh&quot;.
* is transcribed as &quot;j&quot; even when it is voiceless.
* is transcribed as &quot;jj&quot; instead of &quot;tch&quot;.
* is transcribed as &quot;lr&quot; instead of &quot;ll&quot;.
* is transcribed as &quot;lh&quot; instead of &quot;rh&quot;.
* When is pronounced as , it is still transcribed as &quot;r&quot; instead of &quot;n&quot;.
* and are differentiated by a hyphen.
** But when &quot;ng&quot; is followed by &quot;y&quot; or &quot;w&quot;, a hyphen is not used, like the original system.
* In personal names, each syllable in a Sino-Korean given name is separated by a space with the first letter of each syllable capitalized (e.g. &quot;An Pok Chŏl&quot;). Syllables in a native Korean name are joined without syllabic division (e.g. &quot;Kim KKotpuni&quot;).
** However, it is not really possible to follow this rule because a certain name written in hangul can be a native Korean name, or a Sino-Korean name, or even both. For example, can not only be a native Korean name, but can also be a Sino-Korean name (e.g. 寶濫). In some cases, parents intend a dual meaning: both the meaning from a native Korean word and the meaning from hanja.

The following table illustrates the differences above.
=== South Korean variant ===
A variant of McCune–Reischauer was in official use in South Korea from 1984 to 2000. The following are the differences between the original McCune–Reischauer and the South Korean variant:
* was written as &quot;shi&quot; instead of the original system&#x27;s &quot;si&quot;. When is followed by , it is realized as the sound (similar to the English sound (&quot;sh&quot; as in &quot;show&quot;)) instead of the normal sound. The original system deploys &quot;sh&quot; only in the combination , as &quot;shwi&quot;.
* was written as &quot;wo&quot; instead of the original system&#x27;s &quot;wŏ&quot; in this variant. Because the diphthong &quot;w&quot; ( or as a semivowel) + &quot;o&quot; () does not exist in Korean phonology, the South Korean government omitted a breve in &quot;wŏ&quot;.
* Hyphens were used to distinguish between and , between and , and between and in this variant system, instead of the apostrophes and &quot;ë&quot; in the original version. Therefore, apostrophes were used only for aspiration marks and &quot;ë&quot; was not used in the South Korean system.
* was written as &quot;lh&quot; instead of &quot;rh&quot;.
* Assimilation-induced aspiration by an initial is indicated. is written as &quot;kh&quot; in the original McCune–Reischauer system and as &quot;k&quot; in the South Korean variant.
* In personal names, each syllable in a given name was separated by a hyphen. The consonants , , , and right after a hyphen are written as &quot;k&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;ch&quot;, respectively, even when they are voiced (e.g. &quot;Namgung Tong-cha&quot;). But a hyphen can be omitted in non-Sino-Korean names (e.g. &quot;Han Hana&quot;).
** However, it is not really possible to follow this rule. See the #North Korean variant section above.

The following table illustrates the differences above.
=== ALA-LC variant ===
The ALA-LC romanization of Korean is based on but deviates from McCune–Reischauer.
* Unlike the original McCune–Reischauer, it addresses word division in seven pages of detail.
** A postposition (or particle) is separated from its preceding word, even though the original McCune–Reischauer paper explicitly states that this should not be done.
* // + // is written as &quot;ts&quot; instead of &quot;ss&quot;.
* For personal names:
** The surname is written as &quot;Yi&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;.
** A hyphen is inserted between the syllables of a two-syllable given name only when it is preceded by a surname, with the sound change between the syllables indicated. The original McCune–Reischauer paper explicitly states that this also should not be done.
*** However, if a given name is three syllables long or is of non-Sino-Korean origin, the syllables are joined without syllabic division (e.g. &quot;Sin Saimdang&quot;, &quot;Kim Satkat&quot;).

The following table illustrates the differences above.
== Other systems ==
A third system, the Yale romanization system, which is a transliteration system, exists but is used only in academic literature, especially in linguistics.

The Kontsevich system, based on the earlier Kholodovich system, is used for transliterating Korean into the Cyrillic script. Like McCune–Reischauer romanization it attempts to represent the pronunciation of a word, rather than provide letter-to-letter correspondence.

<text>Gunnar Helén (5 June 1918 – 7 December 2002) was a Swedish liberal politician. He was party leader of Liberal People&#x27;s Party 1969–1975, Governor of Kronoberg County 1965–1970 and of Stockholm County 1977–1984.

Helén was awarded the Illis quorum in 1984 and 1987.

== Biography ==
Helén was the son of the supervising teacher Gustaf Helén and Ingeborg Andersson and married in 1938 to the assistant professor Ingrid Rying, daughter of the head teacher Karl-Johan Rying and Märta Eriksson. Gunnar Helén was also a brother-in-law to the author Matts Rying. Like his son Gunnar, his father Gustaf Helén was a liberal, while his father-in-law Karl-Johan Rying was an active Social Democrat.

After graduating in Örebro, Gunnar Helén studied at Uppsala University, where in 1946 he became a doctor of philosophy in Nordic languages on a dissertation on Birger Sjöberg. As a journalist, he worked at Radiotjänst, where he did a famous report from Kungsgatan, Stockholm on Friday, May 7, 1945, but also in 1939 announced that the Second World War had broken out with England and France declaring war on Germany on September 3. Helen also did the first youth program on radio We open a window in 1944, including a report from Högbacka dance floor.

Helén also worked at Stockholms-Tidningen, where he was a cultural journalist, and at Svenska Morgonbladet. He also wrote reviews in the home magazine Katrineholms-Kuriren. In 1956, he was appointed associate professor at Stockholm University.

He was a Member of the Riksdag 1953–1966 for Stockholm County&#x27;s constituency in the second chamber, and 1970–1976 for the City of Stockholm constituency in the first chamber, later the unicameral Riksdag. As a Member of Parliament in the 1950s, he had a great influence on school policy and played an important role in the investigative work that preceded the introduction of compulsory school, a form of schooling that later changed so that much of what Gunnar Helén sought was lost.

Gunnar Helén was County Governor of Kronoberg County 1965-1969 and County Governor of Stockholm County 1977-1984. He was chairman of the board of Sveriges Radios from 1978 to 1984, and subsequently on the board of the Nerikes Allehanda newspaper group. Mr and Mrs Helén are buried in Västra Vingåker cemetery.

<doc id="280693" wikidata="Q53310" url="?curid=280693" title="Nils Edén">
<text>Nils Edén (25 August 1871 – 16 June 1945) was a Swedish historian and liberal politician who served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1917 to 1920, and along with Hjalmar Branting acknowledged as co-architect of Sweden&#x27;s transition from a constitutional monarchy to a fully parliamentary democracy with equal male and female suffrage.

==Early life and education==
Edén was born on 25 August 1871 in Piteå, in Norrbotten, son of a school principal, and graduated from secondary school in Luleå before matriculating at Uppsala University in 1889. He completed his PhD in 1899 and was made docent in history at the university the same year. He was a specialist in Swedish 16th and 17th century history, but also published on topics concerning the union of Sweden and Norway. His dissertation, &quot;Om centralregeringens organisation under den äldre Vasatiden 1523–1594&quot; (&quot;The organization of the central government during the older Vasa period, 1523–1594&quot;, 1899), was awarded the Geijer Prize.

==In Uppsala==
Nils Edén became lecturer of history at Uppsala University in 1899, extraordinary professor in 1903 and ordinary professor in 1909. He retained his chair until 1920, when he became governor of Stockholm county. In the meantime he was active as a liberal politician, having written on the burning issue of the union with Norway as early as the 1890s, arguing among Uppsala students for the system of compulsory military service that was introduced with the abolishment of the allotment system in 1901, and for universal suffrage, an issue that were in his mind and in the political rhetoric of the time connected to that of compulsory military service.

==In the Riksdag==

In 1908, Edén was elected a member of Andra kammaren (the second chamber) of the Swedish parliament. He became a member of the parliamentary constitution committee in 1911. In 1912, when the liberal Karl Staaff became prime minister, Edén was made chairman of the liberal group in the Second chamber. After Staaff&#x27;s death in 1915, Edén emerged as the leader of the liberals. He belonged to the liberal right wing which stood close to the right on defense issues and did not share the view of the many liberals from the temperance and free church movements, whose main representative was Carl Gustaf Ekman. 

==Prime minister==
Edén led the Liberals to heavy gains in the election of 1917. Between them, the Liberals and Social Democrats held a clear majority in the Second Chamber. Nonetheless, King Gustaf V invited the liberal-conservative Johan Widén to form a government. However, the conservatives were unable to line up enough support to form a government. It was now clear that a king could no longer appoint a government dependent solely on him, nor could he keep it in office against the will of the Riksdag. With no choice but to appoint a Liberal as prime minister, Gustaf invited Edén to form a government. He formed a coalition with the Social Democrats, led by Hjalmar Branting who became minister for finance. 

The Edén government promptly arrogated most of the king&#x27;s executive powers to itself. While the Instrument of Government stated that &quot;the King alone shall govern the realm,&quot; it was now understood that Gustaf was required to exercise his powers through the ministers and act on their advice. In turn, the ministers were now both politically and legally responsible to the Riksdag. This marked the definitive establishment of parliamentary government in Sweden, though it would not be formally codified until 1974.

The Edén government finally managed to get a parliamentary majority for universal suffrage. The fear of a revolutionary development in Sweden, under the impression of the events in Russia, post-World War I Germany and elsewhere, created a pressure for further democratization and through a first voting in the parliament, universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.

The Edén cabinet resigned in 1920, after the issue of joining the League of Nations had been resolved.

==County Governor==
Edén was appointed Governor of Stockholm County which he remained until 1938, but continued as a member of the parliament. His objections against the prohibitionist policies of the majority of the party caused him and about a third of the members of liberal group in the parliament to leave the party and create a new party in 1923.

Edén died on 16 June 1945.

<text>Nils Olof Thorbjörn Fälldin (24 April 1926 – 23 July 2016) was a Swedish politician and farmer who served as the prime minister of Sweden from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1979 to 1982, heading three non-consecutive cabinets. He was the leader of the Swedish Centre Party from 1971 to 1985.

On his first appointment in 1976, he was the first non-Social Democrat Prime Minister for 40 years and the first since the 1930s not to have worked as a professional politician since his teens. He was also the last Prime Minister to not be from the Social Democrats or Moderate Party.

==Early life==
Nils Olof Thorbjörn Fälldin was born on 24 April 1926 in Högsjö parish, Ångermanland. He was the son of the farmer Nils Johan Fälldin and his wife Hulda (née Olsson), 
who were involved in agriculturally focused political and civic associations. Fälldin grew up in a farming family in Ångermanland. He grew up on the family family farm in Ramvik, which later became his home as an adult. Fälldin completed his formal schooling at the age of 19.

In 1956, he and his wife, as a newlywed young couple, took over a small farm. However, the farming authorities did not approve the purchase, as the farm was considered too small and too run down for production, and so refused to provide farm subsidies. This fight led him into the youth branch of the Swedish agrarian party Farmers&#x27; League (), which in 1958 changed its name to the Centre Party. He and his family maintained their farm throughout his political life, and when he resigned from politics in 1985, he immediately returned to it.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
Fälldin entered the Swedish national political stage when he was elected to the Second Chamber of the Swedish Riksdag in 1958 for the agrarian-rooted Centre Party. He was part of a younger generation of activists within the party that wished to expand its appeal to urban voters. He was distinguished by his skepticism of social democracy and trade unions. He lost the seat by 11 votes in 1964. Fälldin was then elected to the party board and met with local party organizations, which raised his profile among the Centrists. In 1966 he gained a seat in the First Chamber, where he befriended the leader of the Liberal Party. Fälldin then regained his Second Chamber seat in 1968.

Competing against his rival Johannes Antonsson, he won a party election to became vice-chairman of the party in 1969. Fälldin was able to secure the position without the support of the chairman, Gunnar Hedlund. He succeeded Hedlund as party chairman in 1971. This made him the leader of the largest opposition party, and thus the frontrunner for prime minister from the nonsocialist bloc. Also in 1971 he became a member of the new unicameral Riksdag that replaced the bicameral. With Fälldin&#x27;s ascension to the leadership, criticism of the Social Democratic Party increased.

During the 1973 general election, Fälldin held a live televised debate against Social Democratic party leader and prime minister Olof Palme, which were in the process of becoming a staple of Swedish politics. That year, Fälldin proposed that the party should merge with the Liberal Party, but he failed to gain the support of a majority of party members. The Centre Party received 25.1% of the votes that year, their highest share for a Riksdag election up to that point and since.

===Premiership===
During the 1976 election, Fälldin again debated Palme. Although Palme was perceived as a better debater, Fälldin was perceived as a having won more sympathy with voters, contrasting with Palme&#x27;s aggressive style. In particular, Fälldin emotionally criticized the government&#x27;s proposed nuclear power program, which has been described as a turning point in the Centrists&#x27; favor. During the campaign, his political opponents praised him for honesty and similarities to rural voters, but criticized his lack of foreign policy experience and his inability to understand English. In the election the Social Democrats sensationally lost their majority for the first time in 40 years. The non-Socialist parties (the Centre Party, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Moderate Party) formed a coalition government, and, as the Centre Party was the largest of the three, Fälldin was elected prime minister by the Riksdag and confirmed by king Carl XVI Gustaf during a Council of State, being the first person appointed in this manner under the new 1974 Instrument of Government.

Fälldin&#x27;s initial tenure was the first time a member of the Centre Party headed a Swedish government since Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp&#x27;s brief government forty years earlier, in 1936. Fälldin appointed Liberal leader Per Ahlmark to the newly created position of deputy prime minister. He also appointed fellow Centrist Karin Söder to serve as foreign minister, making her the first woman to hold that role.

Two years later, however, the coalition fell apart over the issue of Swedish dependency on nuclear power (with the Centre Party taking a strong anti-nuclear stand), which led to Fälldin&#x27;s resignation on 18 October, 1978. Ola Ullsten formed a minority Liberal Party government. That year, Fälldin also sued &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; for 1 krona after they published a satirical interview with him from a mental hospital in which they claimed he had schizophrenia. Fälldin claimed that this was illegal, but later lost the case.

Following the 1979 election, Fälldin regained the post of prime minister, despite his party suffering major losses and losing its leading role in the centre-right camp, primarily due to public disenchantment with the Centre Party over its compromise on nuclear power with the nuclear-friendly Moderates, and he again formed a coalition government with the Liberals and the Moderates. This cabinet also lasted for two years, when disagreement over tax policies compelled the Moderates to leave the coalition. Fälldin continued as prime minister until the election in 1982, when the Social Democrats regained power as the Socialist bloc won a majority in the &quot;Riksdag&quot;. On 8 October 1982, Fälldin was succeeded by Palme.

===Post-premiership===
After a disastrous second election defeat in 1985, in which the party received 12.45% of votes, Fälldin faced massive criticism from his party. He resigned as party leader on 5 December 1985. He was succeeded by Söder. He then retired from politics. His posts after that time included chairman of Föreningsbanken, Foreningen Norden, and Televerket. Several subsequent Centre Party leaders personally sought his advice.

===Membership===
Fälldin was one of the board members of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation in the 1970s.

==Personal life==
In 1956, he married Solveig Öberg (born 1935), daughter of the farmer Albert Öberg and Sofia (née Näsman). They had three children; Eva, Nicklas, and Pontus; as well as several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

He died at the age of 90, on 23 July 2016. The funeral was held on 11 August 2016 in Härnösand Cathedral, and he was buried at Högsjö Cemetery in Högsjö, Härnösand Municipality.

==Legacy==
During his 27 years as a national politician, Fälldin was generally appreciated in most political camps for his straightforwardness, unpretentiousness, and willingness to listen to all views. His two periods as Prime Minister were far from easy; trying to get three very different parties to work together in a coalition, while Sweden underwent its worst recession since the 1930s.

Fälldin refused to allow security concerns to rule his life. During his years as prime minister, he lived on his own in a small rented apartment in central Stockholm, while his family ran the farm up in northern Sweden. He did his own cooking and carried out refuse in the morning to the communal dustbins in the backyard, before taking a brisk 15-minute walk to his office, shadowed at a distance by an unmarked police car which had been waiting outside the apartment block; his only concession to the security concerns.

While serving as prime minister during the U 137 crisis in October–November 1981, Fälldin is remembered for the simple answer &quot;Hold the border!&quot; () to the request for instructions from the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces when faced with a suspected Soviet raid to free the stranded submarine. During the 2024 European Parliament election in Sweden, the Centre Party used the phrase as a slogan, representing the party&#x27;s support of stopping imports of Russian fossil fuel and ending EU subsidies to fossil fuels.

==Awards and decorations==
* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland (November 1990)
* Commander with Star of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit (1 July 1999)

<text>Stig Kjell Olof &quot;Ola&quot; Ullsten (23 June 1931 – 28 May 2018) was a Swedish politician and diplomat who was Prime Minister of Sweden from 1978 to 1979 and leader of the Liberal People&#x27;s Party from 1978 to 1983. He also served as Deputy Prime Minister briefly in 1978 and then again from 1980 to 1982 and served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1979 to 1982. Ullsten is Sweden&#x27;s only Liberal prime minister since the 1930s.

==Background and early career==
Stig Kjell Olof Ullsten was born in Teg, Västerbotten, a small town that would ultimately be annexed as a part of county capital Umeå. He was the son of forestry inspector Carl Augustin Ullsten (14 August 1892 – 27 March 1977) and schoolteacher Kristina Ullsten (née Röström; 27 February 1900 – 23 March 1993). Ullsten joined the Liberal Youth of Sweden and the People&#x27;s Party in the spring of 1958.

In his youth he made several travels to the United States, and in 1959 took an active part in the successful campaign to elect liberal Republican Nelson Rockefeller governor of New York. He served as the head of the Liberal Youth of Sweden between 1962 and 1964 and was elected to parliament in 1964.

==Ministerial and political appointments==
Upon the formation in 1976 of the first non-socialist government in Sweden in 40 years, he was appointed Minister for International Development. When Liberal Party leader Per Ahlmark resigned in 1978, Ullsten was elected party leader.

==Prime Minister of Sweden==
Sweden&#x27;s center-right coalition government broke up later in 1978, mainly owing to disagreements over energy policy. Ullsten then succeeded to the post of Prime Minister of Sweden, heading a minority government consisting of Liberal Party and independent ministers. After the successful survival of the coalition in the 1979 parliamentary elections, he resigned as prime minister in favor of Thorbjörn Fälldin, his predecessor.

==Later career==
He then went on to serve as Minister for Foreign Affairs under the new three-party government of Thorbjörn Fälldin from 1979 to 1982. He has later served as the Swedish Ambassador to Canada, also accredited to The Bahamas from 1984 to 1989 and Italy, also accredited to Albania from 1989 to 1995.

==Personal life==
In 1961 he married Evi Esko (29 October 1931 – 2 January 1992), daughter of the teachers Roman Esko and Elsa Tammik. They divorced in 1981 and in 1989 Ullsten married Louise Beaudoin (born 1954).

Ullsten died on 28 May 2018 at the age of 86 of natural causes. At the time of his death, he had four children and three grandchildren.

== Awards ==
Ullsten was awarded the Illis quorum by the government of Sweden in 2001.

<text>Live from Death Row, published in May 1995, is a memoir by Mumia Abu-Jamal, an American journalist and activist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is known for having been convicted of the murder of a city police officer and sentenced to death in 1982, in a trial that Amnesty International suspected of lacking impartiality. Abu-Jamal wrote this book while on death row. He has always maintained his innocence. Publishers Addison-Wesley paid Abu-Jamal a $30,000 advance for the book.

Reports that Abu-Jamal would be paid for the book resulted in protests. In a case decided in Federal appeals court, it ruled that he had the right to be paid for commentary and writings. This is the first of several books that he has published which were completed in prison. His sentence was commuted to life in prison without parole in 2011, after he had been held for 29 years on death row.

==Context==
Abu-Jamal explores many important historical events of relevance to the standing of black people in America. Using numerous references to law and court cases, he argues that the Dred Scott ruling is still relevant to racial relations. He asserts that black people are still far from free, denoting Nelson Mandela&#x27;s plight. He expresses a dislike for William Rehnquist&#x27;s conservative slant and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Rehnquistian&quot; dissent in &quot;Penry v. Lynaugh&quot;, allowing the execution of the intellectually disabled. He mocks Lewis Powell&#x27;s dismissal of statistical evidence of racial discrimination in capital sentencing in &quot;McCleskey v. Kemp&quot; and his dissent in which he states &quot;McCleskey&#x27;s claim, taken to its logical conclusion, throws into serious question the principles that underlie our entire criminal justice system&quot;. He also mentions Harry Blackmun&#x27;s vote in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia,&quot; which ruled the death penalty to be constitutional. Abu-Jamal notes that Blackmun changed his mind; in &quot;Callins v. Collins&quot; the justice stated, &quot;from this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death ... I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed&quot;.

A former Black Panther, Abu-Jamal recalls some of his past experiences with the organization; his one-time role as bodyguard for Huey P. Newton, whom he regards as a hero; the feuding between the Newton-led West Coast members and the Eldridge Cleaver-led East Coast and, ultimately, its decline. He recounts his protest of a George Wallace rally with three other black teens, their subsequent beatings at the hands of white attendees, and his appeal for help to a police officer. The man kicked him in the face while he was on the ground.

Abu-Jamal frequently refers to the MOVE organization, its founder John Africa, and the massacre of 11 people (5 of them children) in a bombing attack on May 13, 1985, and fire caused by the Philadelphia Police Department. He compares this to the Waco siege, which resulted in 82 deaths. He also explores the 1992 trial of Los Angeles officers for the beating of Rodney King, and riots in the city after the officers were acquitted. He said that he believed each of the indicted officers had their constitutional right of double jeopardy violated by being twice put on trial for the same offense.

==Synopsis==

Abu-Jamal structures the book as anecdotes, most exploring the prison system. In an end section titled &quot;Musings, memories, and prophecies&quot;, he discusses past events in his life, and he commemorates some prominent black people in America.

He delves into the purported purpose of prison, suggesting that &quot;corrections&quot; and deterrence are no longer its true goals: he notes that there are barriers to educating inmates and that psychological problems are caused by the practices of putting prisoners in isolation and prohibiting contact during visits. He suggests that prisons are operated in order to &quot;erode one&#x27;s humanity&quot;. He describes the procedures of death row blocs, where twenty-plus-hour solitary confinement is offset by a few hours of recreation and exercise &quot;outside&quot; on penned-in plots of land and limited conversations with other inmates. These often relate to their attempts at appeal and their battles with the law. He details two suicides of fellow inmates, one by hanging and one by self-inflicted burns. He notes that inmates were given drugs to make them more sedated, although this endangered one man with epilepsy. He reports the interactions between &quot;urban&quot; prisoners and &quot;rural&quot; guards, and says that prisoners are subject to brutal beatings, cavity searches, racial harassment, and human rights violations after insurgencies.

In addition to prison conditions, he discusses social issues and their relevance to prison. He expresses dismay toward laws requiring mandatory sentencing, for instance those related to &quot;three strikes&quot;; and criticizes politicians using &quot;tough on crime&quot; slogans to gain support for election. He notes that the United States has the highest number of incarcerated individuals in the world. He hints at racial discrimination, as proposed in the &quot;McCleskey v. Kemp&quot; case. He cites statistics showing that the population on death row in the United States is disproportionately black and Hispanic. He explores elements of the judicial system that reveal it is affected by racism: he notes jury selection by prosecutors that is biased toward persons, often white, who approve the death penalty. In addition, he suggests that expert witnesses for the prosecution suppress or distort evidence to suit the criminal justice system. He also explores the topic of uneven justice, giving examples of police officers acquitted of murder of suspects despite compelling evidence against them. Similarly, he notes that guards frequently receive little if any punishment for inappropriate actions against prisoners.

==Publication==
Abu-Jamal had started providing commentaries to Prison Radio and other outlets. Addison-Wesley paid Abu-Jamal a $30,000 advance for the book.

==Reception==
The notoriety of Abu-Jamal for his case and protests related to his book deal resulted in considerable coverage of this book at publication.

<doc id="280716" wikidata="Q1759664" url="?curid=280716" title="Royal Standard of the United Kingdom">
<text>The royal standard of the United Kingdom is the banner of arms of the monarch of the United Kingdom, currently Charles III. It consists of the monarch&#x27;s coat of arms in flag form, and is made up of four quarters containing the arms of the former kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland. There are two versions of the banner, one used in Scotland in which the Scottish quarters take precedence, and one used elsewhere in which the English quarters take precedence.

The banner is flown to signify the presence of the monarch. It may be flown when they are present at one of their residences, from the car, ship, or aeroplane they are travelling in, and from any building they are visiting. The banner is never flown at half-mast, as a symbol of the continuity of the monarchy, and also as there is always a sovereign on the throne.

Although almost universally called a standard, in heraldic terminology the flag is a banner of arms, as it is a coat of arms in flag form; standards are more typically tapering flags on which heraldic badges and mottoes are displayed.

== United Kingdom (outside Scotland), the Crown dependencies, and the British Overseas Territories ==
In England, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Crown dependencies and the British Overseas Territories, the flag is divided into four quadrants. The first and fourth quadrants represent the ancient Kingdom of England and contain three gold lions (or &quot;leopards&quot;), passant guardant on a red field; the second quadrant represents the ancient Kingdom of Scotland and contains a red lion rampant on a gold field; the third quadrant represents the ancient Kingdom of Ireland and contains a version of the gold harp from the coat of arms of Ireland on a blue field. The inclusion of the harp remains an issue for some in Ireland. In 1937 Éamon de Valera, then Taoiseach, asked Dominions Secretary Malcolm MacDonald if the harp quarter could be removed from the Royal Standard on the grounds that the Irish people had not given their consent to the Irish emblem being included. The request was denied, and the harp remains.

The modern Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, apart from minor changes (notably to the form of harp used to represent Ireland), dates to the reign of Queen Victoria. Earlier Royal Standards of the United Kingdom incorporated the Arms of Hanover and of the Kingdom of France, representing the title of Elector (later King) of Hanover and the theoretical claim to the throne of France, a claim dropped in 1800). The Hanoverian association terminated in 1837 with the accession of Queen Victoria who, being a female, could not accede to Hanover.

Famous Royal Standards of former British Monarchs include the &quot;Scotland Impaled&quot; Royal Standard of Queen Anne, the &quot;Hanover Quartered&quot; Royal Standards of King George I to George III, and the &quot;Hanover crowned&quot; Royal Standards of George III to William IV. The latter contained the Royal coat of arms of Hanover superimposed over what became the modern Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, although this particular standard&#x27;s artistic representations of the banners of England, Ireland and Scotland in their respective quadrants was marginally different from the versions used today.

==Scotland==
In Scotland a separate version of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is used, whereby the red Lion Rampant of the Kingdom of Scotland appears in the first and fourth quadrants, displacing the three gold lions passant guardant of England, which occur only in the second quadrant. The third quadrant, displaying the gold harp of Ireland, remains unaltered from that version used throughout the remainder of the United Kingdom and overseas.

The Scottish version of the Royal Standard was used to cover the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II during the procession on the Royal Mile from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St. Giles&#x27; Cathedral on 12 September 2022.

Other members of the royal family also use this Scottish version when in Scotland, with the only exceptions to this protocol being the consort of a queen regnant and the heir apparent, the Duke of Rothesay, each of whom has his own individual standard.

The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland differs from the current, traditional Royal Standard of Scotland in that the latter portrays the Lion Rampant in its entirety. As the banner of the Royal Coat of Arms of Scotland, the Royal Standard of Scotland remains a personal banner of the monarch and, despite being commonly used as an unofficial second flag of Scotland, its use is restricted under an act passed in 1672 by the Parliament of Scotland.

The historic Royal Standard of Scotland is used officially at Scottish royal residences, when the monarch is not in residence, and by representatives of the Crown, including the First Minister, Lord Lieutenants in their lieutenancies, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and Lord Lyon King of Arms. A variation of the Royal Standard of Scotland is used by the heir apparent to the King of Scots, the Duke of Rothesay, whose personal Royal Standard is the Royal Standard of Scotland defaced with an azure-coloured label of three points. (The banner of the Duke of Rothesay also features the same, displayed upon an inner shield).

==Heir to the Throne==
The direct heir to the Throne has several distinct standards and banners for use throughout the United Kingdom in representation of this position. William, Prince of Wales has five standards at use for his various roles and titles.

Historic
==Other members of the royal family==
Other members of the royal family have personal standards of their own. These are variants of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom (including that which is used in Scotland), defaced with a white label and either three points or pendants (for children of a sovereign), or five points (grandchildren of a sovereign). Traditionally all princes and princesses of royal blood (i.e., descendants of the sovereign) are granted arms on their 18th birthday, thus giving them a banner to fly from their residences.

The following members of the royal family have personal standards, listed according to the line of succession:

===Consorts of the British monarch===
Queens consort of the British monarch are granted arms based on the Royal Standard and their own personal arms from before their marriage, or the arms of their family. In Scotland, a queen consort will use the Scottish version of the Royal Standard. They do not have different standards for the Commonwealth realms that have their own Royal Standards.

Consorts of a queen regnant are not granted use of the British Royal Standard. They use standards based on their own family arms. However, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha used a standard of the royal arms (with a label for difference) quartered with his own family arms.

===Recent historical royal standards===
=== Royal standards 1198–1837 ===
===Others===


Other members of the royal family may use the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, but within an ermine border (a white border with black &quot;tails&quot; representing the ermine fur). This standard is mainly used for the wives of British princes, or members of the royal family who have not yet been granted their own arms. Diana, Princess of Wales, and, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, had this standard draped over their coffins at their funerals.

Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, also enjoyed the right to use this version of the Royal Standard although she rarely exercised it on her own. She received a grant of arms on 17 July 2005, which, based on past practice, could form the basis for her own standard. Since the ascension of her husband Charles III, as queen consort she has used a new version, based on her husband&#x27;s royal standard, impaled with the arms of her father, Major Bruce Shand.

==Uses of Standards==
The Royal Standard is reserved only for the monarch. Most famously it signals the presence of the monarch at a royal residence, and is also used on official vehicles, primarily the Bentley State Limousine, but also on other road vehicles at home or abroad, often a Range Rover. The Royal Standard is also flown from aircraft and water vessels, including HMY &quot;Britannia&quot; and MV &quot;Spirit of Chartwell&quot; during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant. When the monarch is aboard a British naval ship, the flag is flown from the main mast of the ship and is lowered upon his/her departure. The flag is also draped over the coffin of the Monarch upon his/her death.

In some situations, personal standards are displayed within the UK, such as within St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh (site of the Chapel of the Order of the Thistle), and St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle home of Banners of Knights of the Order of the Garter, at the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant Prince Andrew&#x27;s standard flew from MV &quot;Havengore&quot;. However, the use of personal standards of other members of the royal family varies in frequency. Prior to his accession, the then-Prince of Wales flew his standard at Clarence House in the same way the Royal Standard is used over Buckingham Palace, but other members of the family tend not to fly theirs from their respective residences (though this may be due to the fact that many share official London Residences, as is the case at Kensington Palace).

Family members also do not use their standards on road vehicles, either privately or during official engagements (when more discreet cars are used, such as Jaguar) or state occasions (when the Liveried cars of the Royal Mews are used), this seems reserved for the Queen only, although when Prince Philip traveled alone at state occasions, his standard flew from the roof of his car, as seen with the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales (when the Queen Mother also flew her personal standard from her car) and that of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, also, when a visiting Head of State on a state visit uses a car from the Royal Mews, his/her own flag is displayed. That said, when abroad, the standards of members of the family may well be flown: examples include Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William.

Personal Standards have been used to cover the coffins of the Queen Mother, the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Windsor.

=== Position of Honour ===
According to the Flag Institute, the order of precedence of flags in the United Kingdom is: the Royal Standard, Union Flag, the flag of the host country (England, Scotland and Wales etc.), the flags of other nations (in alphabetical order), the Commonwealth Flag, the Flag of Europe, the county flags, the flags of cities or towns, the banners of arms, and the house flags.

<doc id="280728" wikidata="Q2071294" url="?curid=280728" title="RAF Mount Pleasant">
<text>RAF Mount Pleasant (also known as Mount Pleasant Airport, Mount Pleasant Complex or MPA) is a Royal Air Force station in the British Overseas Territory of the Falkland Islands. The airfield goes by the motto of &quot;Defend the right&quot; (while the motto of the islands is &quot;Desire the right&quot;) and is part of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands (BFSAI). Home to between 1,000 and 2,000 British military personnel, it is about southwest of Stanley, the capital of the Falklands, on the island of East Falkland. The world&#x27;s longest corridor, long, links the barracks, messes, and recreational and welfare areas of the station, and was nicknamed the &quot;Death Star Corridor&quot; by personnel due to its drab and foreboding ambience, before it was re-designed, re-painted, and re-named &quot;Millennium Corridor&quot;.

Mount Pleasant was opened by Prince Andrew on 12 May 1985, becoming fully operational the following year. The station was constructed as part of British efforts to strengthen the defence of the Falkland Islands following the Falklands War. It remains the newest purpose-built RAF station and replaced previous RAF facilities at Port Stanley Airport.

==History==

=== Falklands War ===
RAF Mount Pleasant is the newest permanent airfield in the Royal Air Force. The RAF previously had a small airfield at Port Stanley Airport after the end of the hostilities in 1982. During the Falklands War when the islands were occupied by Argentine military forces, British aircraft were sent to disable the runway with RAF Strike Command Vulcan bombers (Operation Black Buck) and Royal Navy Sea Harriers. The first two Black Buck missions were flown under tactics to make it reasonably probable at least one of twenty-one 1,000-pound bombs dropped would hit the target. On the first mission one bomb hit the edge of the runway. The damage was easily repaired by Argentine engineers. C-130 Hercules transport aircraft were able to bring in supplies and take out casualties until the end of the conflict using one side of the runway. Pucará, Fokkers and Aermacchi AM-339 fast-jet fighters also operated from the runway from the first until the last day of the campaign. The second Black Buck mission failed to hit the runway. No Argentine aircraft were moved north to defend Buenos Aires. At the end of hostilities, the runway was fully repaired by British military engineers.

After the surrender of the Argentine ground forces on the islands, the British still faced the problem of potential Argentine air attacks from Argentina, so an aircraft carrier had to remain on station to guard the islands with its squadron of Sea Harriers until the local airfield was prepared for jet aircraft. was the first to take guard duty, whilst went north to change a main engine at sea. &quot;Invincible&quot; then returned to relieve &quot;Hermes&quot; which urgently needed to return to the UK for boiler cleaning. &quot;Invincible&quot; returned until she was relieved by the newly built , which was quickly rushed south and commissioned during the journey. Once the Port Stanley runway was available for jets, &quot;Illustrious&quot; was relieved by 23 Squadron operating the F-4 Phantom FGR.2. Initially stationed at RAF Stanley, the unit moved to Mount Pleasant upon its opening.

=== Construction ===
In order to deter further Argentine aggression or invasion attempts, the British Government considered it necessary to enhance the military presence in the Falklands. However, the temporary military airfield at RAF Stanley was restricted by the length and strength of its runway. Therefore, in June 1983, the British Government announced that a new military airfield would be constructed at Mount Pleasant, the option being considered to be more cost effective and straightforward than upgrading RAF Stanley. It would also allow RAF Stanley to remain operational whilst the new airfield was constructed.

The Ministry of Defence reached a voluntary agreement to purchase of farmland for £55,000, with severance compensation assessed at £100,000. To allow existing agricultural operations to continue, Mount Pleasant House and other farm facilities were relocated at a cost of £83,877.

The airfield at Mount Pleasant was constructed by Mowlem-Laing Amey Roadstone Construction, a consortium of British civil engineering and construction firms Mowlem, John Laing Group and Amey plc. At the construction stage the airfield was called the Falkland Island Strategic Airfield or FISA and was designed to accommodate military as well as civil wide-body aircraft, enabling efficiencies in the running costs and time taken to support the Falklands garrison. The construction and shipping of materials to the Falklands was expected to cost approximately £190 million. Additional costs included the provision of a road between Stanley and Mount Pleasant and the installation of communication and navigation aids, bringing the overall cost to approximately £215m. Construction began in Autumn 1983 and the new runway was expected to be available for use by April 1985, with the wider airfield complete by February 1986.

RAF Mount Pleasant was opened by Prince Andrew (who saw active duty during the Falklands War while serving in the Fleet Air Arm) on 12 May 1985 and became fully operational on 1 May 1986.

=== Protecting the Falklands ===
Mount Pleasant&#x27;s first flying unit, No. 23 Squadron, equipped with four McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2, arrived from RAF Stanley on 21 April 1986. The Phantoms were joined by No. 78 Squadron on 22 May 1986, which was reformed from the former No. 1310 Flight, operating the Boeing Chinook HC1 and No. 1564 Flight, operating the Westland Sea King HAR3. Later in 1986, two Lockheed C-130 Hercules C1K of No. 1312 Flight, operating in the air-to-air refuelling role, moved to Mount Pleasant to support the Phantoms.Responsibility for the air-defence and of the Falklands and the Phantoms of No. 23 Squadron were transferred to No. 1435 Flight on 1 November 1988. Subsequently, the flight&#x27;s Phantoms were replaced when four Panavia Tornado F3 arrived in the Falklands in July 1992.

No. 1312 Flight&#x27;s Hercules C1K were withdrawn in April 1996, with the flight gaining a Vickers VC10 K4 for air-to-air refuelling and C-130 Hercules C3 in the transport role.

In September 2009, the Falklands&#x27; air-defence capability was enhanced when No. 1435 Flight&#x27;s Tornado F3s were replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 in the quick reaction alert (QRA) role, at a cost of £1.56 million. To accommodate the Typhoon, a further £416,000 was spent on infrastructure improvements to the airfield. As of 2024, the Tranche 1 variant of the Typhoon is deployed in the islands. 

As part of the RAF&#x27;s wider upgrade of their Hercules, the C3 variant of No. 1312 Flight was replaced with a C-130J C5 in April 2010. A Lockheed TriStar K1 took over the air-to-air refuelling role from the VC10 K4 in October 2013, when the latter was withdrawn from RAF service. The TriStar itself was soon replaced, in February 2014, by an Airbus A330 Voyager KC3.

Chinook helicopters provided heavy-lift support until they were withdrawn in 2006. In 2015, the Chinooks were redeployed to Mount Pleasant. A flight of Westland Sea King helicopters for support and search and rescue was located at Mount Pleasant from November 2007 until April 2016.

Prince William served as a Sea King pilot on the station for six weeks during February and March 2012.

As of 1 April 2016, with the retirement of Westland Sea King the Islands&#x27; search and rescue function has been replaced by a commercial organisation, AAR, subcontracting the services to British International Helicopters for 10 years using two new AgustaWestland AW189s.

1312 Flight&#x27;s Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules, used for transport, search and rescue, and maritime patrol, was replaced with an Airbus A400M Atlas C1 in April 2018.

== Facilities ==
Mount Pleasant Complex has a wide range of social and sporting facilities including a gym, swimming pool, golf course, diving centre, kart racing, Laser Quest, library, cinema, bowling, climbing wall, and indoor and outdoor sports pitches. As of August 2010, it has the only cricket ground in the Falklands. There are two NAAFI shops, a NAAFI Bar, a Costa Coffee café, hairdressers, a medical centre, and an education centre on the base. BFBS Radio also maintains a live local station on the site. There is also a complex that includes a small shop which is owned and run by the Falkland Islands Company.

==Role and operations==
 The station provides a base for air-defence and transport operations in the south Atlantic and is home to No. 905 Expeditionary Air Wing, part of British Forces South Atlantic Islands. The wing comprises two RAF flights, which operate a range of aircraft:

* Four Eurofighter Typhoon Tranche 1s are operated by No. 1435 Flight which provides air defence for the Falklands, South Sandwich Islands and South Georgia.
* No. 1312 Flight operates an Airbus Voyager KC2 which is used for air-to-air refuelling and transportation. The Voyager works alongside an Airbus A400M Atlas C1 providing tactical transport, maritime patrol, search and rescue and humanitarian assistance capabilities.

Additionally, the civilian firm, Bristow Helicopters (BIH), operates two Sikorsky S-92 for personnel and equipment transport and also flies two AgustaWestland AW189s for search and rescue operations.

The British Army maintains a garrison on the Falkland Islands based at Mount Pleasant. It includes a roulement infantry company, an air defence surface-to-air missile unit, an Explosive Ordinance Disposal detachment, engineers and supporting elements.

There is also a Joint Communications Unit (JCU) providing the electronic warfare and command and control systems for the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force.

==Airlines and destinations==

Using the IATA airport code MPN, Mount Pleasant Complex also acts as the Falkland Islands&#x27; only international airport, along with its military role. Flights open to civilian passengers are operated twice each week. The Hercules C-130 Transport Force operating out of RAF Lyneham supplied a direct non-stop service from RAF Lyneham via Ascension, Wideawake Airfield. From Ascension the flight was direct involving in-flight refuelling from a C-130 tanker. The flight duration was usually about 12 hours down and 13 hours back. The last scheduled flight in the world involving in-flight refuelling was carried out by a crew of 24 Squadron in C-130 XV291 during the period 18–23 March 1989. This was the 650th and last of its type carried out by RAF Lyneham C-130s. Flights were then operated directly by the RAF using the Lockheed TriStars of 216 Squadron. Starting in autumn 2008, these flights were operated on behalf of the Royal Air Force by a civilian airline, Flyglobespan. Since the airline&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2009, the flights have been operated by Air Tahiti Nui, Titan Airways, Air Seychelles and Hi Fly. The service is now operated by AirTanker using Airbus Voyager aircraft. Up to 2022, they flew to and from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, with a refuelling stop at Cape Verde because the runway at RAF Ascension Island was closed. With the opening of one side of the runway at Ascension in 2022, normal flights could resume. Repairs to both sides of the runway at Ascension Island were fully completed in Spring of 2023.

On 2 March 2012, the Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner called for Aerolíneas Argentinas flights to Buenos Aires to replace LATAM Airlines flights to Chile. The idea of flights to Argentina was not supported on the islands, because this might result in Argentina having a monopoly on commercial flights and controlling all commercial air access.

On 2 April 2012, Uruguayan company Air Class Líneas Aéreas gained permission from the Uruguayan Ministry of Defence to start a commercial flight to the Falkland Islands.

<text>John Ford (1586) was an English playwright and poet of the Jacobean and Caroline eras born in Ilsington in Devon, England. His plays deal mainly with the conflict between passion and conscience. Although remembered primarily as a playwright, he also wrote a number of poems on themes of love and morality.

==Origins==
John Ford was baptised 17 April 1586 at Ilsington Church, Devon. He was the second son of Thomas Ford (1556–1610) of Bagtor in the parish of Ilsington, and his wife Elizabeth Popham (died 1629) of the Popham family of Huntworth in Somerset. Her monument exists in Ilsington Church. Thomas Ford&#x27;s grandfather was John Ford (died 1538) of Ashburton (the son and heir of William Ford of Chagford) who purchased the estate of Bagtor in the parish of Ilsington, which his male heirs successively made their seat. The Elizabethan mansion of the Fords survives today at Bagtor as the service wing of a later house appended in about 1700.

==Life and work==
Ford left home to study in London, although more specific details are unclear—a sixteen-year-old John Ford of Devon was admitted to Exeter College, Oxford, on 26 March 1601, but this was when the dramatist had not yet reached his sixteenth birthday. He joined an institution that was a prestigious law school but also a centre of literary and dramatic activity—the Middle Temple. A prominent junior member in 1601 was the playwright John Marston. (It is unknown whether Ford ever actually studied law while a resident of the Middle Temple, or whether he was strictly a gentleman boarder, which was a common arrangement at the time).

It was not until 1606 that Ford wrote his first works for publication. In the spring of that year he was expelled from Middle Temple, due to his financial problems, and &quot;Fame&#x27;s Memorial&quot; and &quot;Honour Triumphant&quot; soon followed. Both works are clear bids for patronage: &quot;Fame&#x27;s Memorial&quot; is an elegy of 1169 lines on the recently deceased Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire, while &quot;Honour Triumphant&quot; is a prose pamphlet, a verbal fantasia written in connection with the jousts planned for the summer 1606 visit of King Christian IV of Denmark. It is unknown whether either of these brought any financial remuneration to Ford; yet by June 1608 he had enough money to be readmitted to the Middle Temple.

Prior to the start of his career as a playwright, Ford wrote other non-dramatic literary works—the long religious poem &quot;Christ&#x27;s Bloody Sweat&quot; (1613), and two prose essays published as pamphlets, &quot;The Golden Mean&quot; (1613) and &quot;A Line of Life&quot; (1620). After 1620 he began active dramatic writing, first as a collaborator with more experienced playwrights—primarily Thomas Dekker, but also John Webster and William Rowley—and by the later 1620s as a solo artist.

Ford is best known for the tragedy &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (1633), a family drama with a plot line of incest. The play&#x27;s title has often been changed in new productions, sometimes being referred to as simply &quot;Giovanni and Annabella&quot;—the play&#x27;s leading, incestuous brother-and-sister characters; in a nineteenth-century work it is coyly called &quot;The Brother and Sister&quot;. Shocking as the play is, it is still widely regarded as a classic piece of English drama. It has been adapted to film at least twice: &quot;My Sister, My Love&quot; (Sweden, 1966) and &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (Belgium, 1978).

He was a major playwright during the reign of Charles I. His plays deal with conflicts between individual passion and conscience and the laws and morals of society at large; Ford had a strong interest in abnormal psychology that is expressed through his dramas. His plays often show the influence of Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. While virtually nothing is known of Ford&#x27;s personal life, one reference suggests that his interest in melancholia may have been more than merely intellectual. The volume &quot;Choice Drollery&quot; (1656) asserts that

::Deep in a dump alone John Ford was gat,
::With folded arms and melancholy hat.

==The canon of Ford&#x27;s plays==
Ford began his dramatic career in a way common in the period, by contributing to plays co-authored with more established dramatists. Six such plays survive:
* &quot;The Laws of Candy&quot; (1620; printed 1647), with Philip Massinger;
* &quot;The Witch of Edmonton&quot; (1621; printed 1658), with Thomas Dekker and William Rowley;
* &quot;The Welsh Ambassador&quot; (1623; printed 1920), with Dekker;
* &quot;The Spanish Gypsy&quot; (licensed 9 July 1623; printed 1653), with Dekker, Thomas Middleton, and Rowley;
* &quot;The Sun&#x27;s Darling&quot; (licensed 3 March 1624; revised 1638–39; printed 1656), with Dekker;
* &quot;The Fair Maid of the Inn&quot; (1626; printed 1647), with Massinger, John Webster, and John Fletcher.

The attributions of several of these plays to their various authors were often debated or regarded as uncertain. Such questions were placed beyond reasonable doubt in 2017 with the publication of Volume II of &quot;The Collected Works of John Ford&quot;, ed. Brian Vickers, which contains 300 pages of evidence and discussion clearly identifying each of the above authors&#x27; contributions to those six plays. Darren Freebury-Jones has proposed that Ford was responsible for completing &quot;The Noble Gentleman&quot; after John Fletcher died in 1625.

After 1626 Ford made the transition to sole author and wrote a further eight surviving plays:
* &quot;The Queen&quot; (1627; printed 1653)
* &quot;The Lover&#x27;s Melancholy&quot; (licensed 24 November 1628; printed 1629)
* &quot;The Broken Heart&quot; (1629; printed 1633)
* &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (1631; printed 1633)
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot; (1632; printed 1633)
* &quot;Perkin Warbeck&quot; (1633; printed 1634)
* &quot;The Fancies Chaste and Noble&quot; (1636; printed 1638)
* &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Trial&quot; (licensed 3 May 1638; printed 1639)

As is typical for pre-Restoration playwrights, a significant portion of Ford&#x27;s output has not survived. Lost plays by Ford include &quot;The Royal Combat&quot; and &quot;Beauty in a Trance&quot;, plus more collaborations with Dekker: &quot;The London Merchant, The Bristol Merchant, The Fairy Knight,&quot; and &quot;Keep the Widow Waking,&quot; the last also with William Rowley and John Webster.

In 1940, critic Alfred Harbage argued that Sir Robert Howard&#x27;s play &quot;The Great Favourite, or The Duke of Lerma&quot; is an adaptation of a lost play by Ford. Harbage noted that many previous critics had judged the play suspiciously good, too good for Howard; and Harbage pointed to a range of resemblances between the play and Ford&#x27;s work. The case, however, relies solely upon internal evidence and subjective judgements.

== Poetry ==
As well as the poems already mentioned, several others have survived. In the 1920s, Australian-born composer John Gough set Ford&#x27;s &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Beauty&quot; to music.

<doc id="280736" wikidata="Q1076161" url="?curid=280736" title="Dwight Gooden">
<text>Dwight Eugene Gooden (born November 16, 1964), nicknamed &quot;Dr. K&quot; and &quot;Doc&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Gooden pitched from 1984 to 1994 and from 1996 to 2000 for the New York Mets, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In a career spanning 430 games, he pitched innings and posted a win–loss record of 194–112, with a 3.51 earned run average (ERA), and 2,293 strikeouts.

Gooden made his MLB debut in 1984 for the Mets and quickly established himself as one of the league&#x27;s most talented pitchers; as a 19-year-old rookie, he earned the first of four All-Star selections, won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award, and led the league in strikeouts. In 1985, he won the NL Cy Young Award and achieved the pitching Triple Crown, compiling a 24–4 record and a league-leading 1.53 ERA, 268 strikeouts, and 16 complete games. The following season, he helped the Mets win the 1986 World Series.

Gooden remained an effective pitcher in subsequent years, but his career was ultimately derailed by cocaine and alcohol addiction. After posting a losing record in each season from 1992 to 1994, Gooden was suspended for the 1995 season after a positive drug test while serving a prior suspension. As a member of the Yankees in 1996, Gooden pitched a no-hitter and helped the team on its path to a World Series championship. He pitched four additional years for as many teams, but never approached the success of his peak years with the Mets. In 2010, Gooden was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame and on April 14, 2024, Gooden&#x27;s number 16 was retired by the New York Mets. Gooden&#x27;s troubles with addiction continued after his retirement from baseball and resulted in several arrests. He was incarcerated for seven months in 2006 after violating the terms of his probation.

==Career==
Gooden attended Hillsborough High School in Tampa where he was teammates on the school&#x27;s baseball team with Vance Lovelace. A native of Tampa, Florida, Dwight Gooden was drafted in the first round in 1982, the fifth player taken overall. He spent one season in the minors, in which he led the Class-A Carolina League in wins, strikeouts and ERA while playing for the Lynchburg Mets. Gooden had 300 strikeouts in 191 innings, a performance which convinced Triple-A Tidewater Tides manager and future Mets manager Davey Johnson to bring him up for the Tides&#x27; postseason.

===1984–1994: New York Mets===

====1984====
Gooden made the rare jump from High-A directly to the major leagues in one year, bypassing Double-A and Triple-A. He made his major-league debut on April 7, 1984, with the New York Mets at the age of 19. He quickly developed a reputation with his fastball and sweeping curveball, which was given the superlative nickname of &quot;Lord Charles&quot;, in contrast with &quot;Uncle Charlie&quot;, a common nickname for a curveball. He was dubbed &quot;Dr. K&quot;, in reference to the letter &quot;K&quot; being the standard abbreviation for strikeout, which soon became shortened to &quot;Doc&quot;. Gooden soon attracted a rooting section at Shea Stadium that called itself &quot;The K Korner&quot;, and would hang up cards with a red &quot;K&quot; after each of his strikeouts.

When he took the mound in the fifth inning on July 10, 1984, Gooden became the youngest player to appear in an All-Star Game. He complemented this distinction by striking out the side, AL batters: Lance Parrish, Chet Lemon, and Alvin Davis. Setting up Gooden, NL Pitcher Fernando Valenzuela had already struck out the side in the fourth, putting down future Hall of Famers Dave Winfield, Reggie Jackson, and George Brett. The two pitchers&#x27; combined performance broke an All-Star game record, coincidentally on its celebrated 50th anniversary—Carl Hubbell&#x27;s five consecutive strikeouts in 1934.

That season, Gooden won 17 games, the most by a 19-year-old since Wally Bunker won 19 games in 1964 and the second most for a Mets rookie, after Jerry Koosman&#x27;s 19 wins in 1968. Gooden won eight of his last nine starts; in his final three starts of the 1984 season, he had 41 strikeouts and 1 walk. Gooden led the league in strikeouts, his 276 breaking Herb Score&#x27;s rookie record of 245 in 1955, and also set the record for most strikeouts in three consecutive starts with 43. As a 19-year-old rookie, Gooden set the then-major league record for strikeouts per 9 innings, with 11.39, breaking Sam McDowell&#x27;s record of 10.71 in 1965. He was voted the Rookie of the Year, giving the Mets two consecutive winners of that award (Darryl Strawberry had been the recipient in 1983). Gooden also became the third Mets pitcher to win the award, joining Tom Seaver () and Jon Matlack (). Gooden finished second in the NL Cy Young Award voting, even though he had more wins, strikeouts, and innings pitched as well as a lower ERA than the NL winner, Rick Sutcliffe.

====1985====
In 1985, Gooden pitched one of the most statistically dominant single seasons in baseball history. Leading Major League Baseball with 24 wins, 268 strikeouts, and a 1.53 ERA, the second-lowest in the live-ball era, trailing only Bob Gibson&#x27;s 1.12 in 1968. Gooden earned the major leagues&#x27; pitching Triple Crown. He led the National League in complete games (16) and innings pitched (276). After his first start, his ERA never rose above 2.00. At age 20, he was the youngest pitcher of the last half-century to have an ERA+ above 200. Gooden&#x27;s ERA+ was 229; 23-year-old Dean Chance (200 ERA+ in 1964) was the only other pitcher under the age of 25 to do so. From August 31 through September 16, Gooden threw 31 consecutive scoreless innings over four games, and through October 2, threw 49 consecutive innings over seven games without allowing an earned run. Gooden had one of the highest quality start percentages in a season, with 33 quality starts in 35 games.

In September, he pitched back-to-back nine-inning games allowing no runs, but received no-decisions in both games. In his four losses, Gooden allowed 26 hits and five walks in 28 innings, with 28 strikeouts and a 2.89 ERA. The Mets finished second in the 1985 NL East. Teammates jokingly blamed Gooden for having lost 4 games, thereby mathematically costing them the division title. That year, Gooden became one of only 15 black pitchers ever to win 20 games in a season, the most recent of whom was David Price. Gooden became the youngest-ever recipient of the Cy Young Award and Pitcher of the Year Award. That November, Gooden turned 21.

Travelers descending the steps of the side entrance to Manhattan&#x27;s Penn Station were greeted by an enormous photograph of Gooden in mid-motion that recorded his season&#x27;s strikeout totals as the year progressed. Likewise, those strolling the streets of Manhattan&#x27;s West Side could gaze up at a 102 feet tall &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; mural of Gooden painted on the side of a building at 351 West 42nd Street in Times Square, whose caption asked &quot;How does it feel to look down the barrel of a loaded gun?&quot; In a span of 50 starts from August 11, 1984, to May 6, 1986, Gooden posted a record of 37–5 with a 1.38 ERA; he had 412 strikeouts and 90 walks in 406 innings.

====1986====
In 1986, he compiled a 17–6 record. Gooden&#x27;s 200 strikeouts were fifth in the National League, more than a hundred behind the league leader, Mike Scott of the Houston Astros and a tremendous decrease from his first two seasons. As the 1986 season progressed, Gooden felt that his fastball became less effectivve. “That impossible-to-track, impossible-to-time movement deserted me in 1986, and never returned,” he said. Gooden had compiled a strikeouts per nine innings pitched of 10.05 for this first two seasons. For the rest of his career, he would strike out only 5.91 batters per nine innings.

In another All-Star record, in 1986 Gooden became the youngest pitcher to start an All-Star Game at of age. Gooden was the Mets ace going into the playoffs, and his postseason started promisingly. He lost a 1–0 duel with Scott in the NLCS opener, then got a no-decision in Game 5, pitching 10 innings of one-run ball. He was substantially worse in the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, not getting past the 5th inning in either of his two starts. Nevertheless, the Mets won four of the five non-Gooden starts and the championship. In an early red flag, Gooden failed to attend the team&#x27;s victory parade. In 2011, he said that during the 1986 parade he had been using drugs at his dealer&#x27;s apartment.

====1987: Early drug problems and injuries====
Gooden was arrested on December 13, 1986, in Tampa, Florida after being assaulted by police. A report clearing police of misconduct in the arrest helped start the 1987 Tampa riots. Gooden tested positive for cocaine during spring training in 1987. He entered a rehabilitation center on April 1 to avoid being suspended. He did not make his first start of the season until June 5. Despite missing a third of the season, Gooden won 15 games for the 1987 Mets. In 1988, he was profiled in the William Goldman and Mike Lupica book &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot;, which looked at the impact Gooden&#x27;s drug use and enforced missed games had on the Mets over the 1987 season.

====1988====
In 1988, Gooden had an 18–9 record as the Mets returned to the postseason. In the first game of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Gooden was matched against Orel Hershiser, who had just finished the regular season with a 59-inning scoreless streak. Gooden pitched well, allowing just 4 hits and recording 10 strikeouts, but left after seven innings trailing 2–0. In his next start in Game 4, Gooden entered the ninth inning with a 4–2 lead and the chance to give his Mets a commanding 3–1 advantage in the series. But he allowed a game-tying home run to Mike Scioscia, and the Dodgers eventually went on to win the game in 12 innings, and ultimately the series as well, 4 games to 3.

====1989–91====

Gooden suffered a shoulder injury in 1989, which limited him to just 17 starts, during which he posted a 9–4 record. He rebounded in 1990, posting a 19–7 season with 223 strikeouts, tied for second behind teammate David Cone&#x27;s 233. However, after another injury in 1991, Gooden&#x27;s career declined significantly. Though drug abuse is commonly blamed for Gooden&#x27;s pitching troubles, some analysts point to his early workload. It has been estimated that Gooden threw over 10,800 pitches from 1983 to 1985, a period in which he was 18 to 20 years old. Gooden hurled innings in his historic 1985 season; season, only two pitchers have since thrown that many innings: Charlie Hough, a knuckleballer, and Roger Clemens, both in 1987. By the time he reached his 21st birthday, Gooden already had 928 strikeouts between the minor and major leagues.

On August 9, 1990, Phillies pitcher Pat Combs struck Gooden in the knee with the first pitch of the bottom of the fifth inning. Gooden, seeing the pitch as retaliation for him having hit two Phillies batters, charged the mound, setting off a bench-clearing brawl. Gooden was one of six players ejected.

Gooden was accused of rape along with teammates Vince Coleman and Daryl Boston in 1991; however, authorities questioned the alleged victim and found insufficient evidence to charge anyone.

====1992–95====
1992 was Gooden&#x27;s first-ever losing season (10–13); it was also the first time he had at least 10 losses. Before the 1993 season, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran a cover story on Gooden entitled, &quot;From Phenom to Phantom.&quot; The next year was no improvement, as Gooden finished 12–15.

During the strike-shortened 1994 season at age 29, Gooden had a 3–4 record with a 6.31 ERA when he tested positive for cocaine use and was suspended for 60 days. He tested positive again while serving the suspension, and was further suspended for the entire 1995 season. The day after receiving the second suspension, Gooden&#x27;s wife, Monica, found him in his bedroom with a loaded gun to his head.

In July 1995, the famous longstanding Gooden Times Square mural was replaced with a Charles Oakley mural. The Dwight Gooden mural was a part of the New York City landscape for more than 10 years.

Kirk Radomski, the New York Mets clubhouse attendant whose allegations are at the base of the Mitchell Report, later claimed that he took two urine tests for Gooden during the 1990s. Gooden denies the allegations.

===1996–1997: New York Yankees===
Gooden signed with the New York Yankees in 1996 as a free agent. After pitching poorly in April and nearly getting released, he was sent down to the minors where he worked on his mechanics and soon returned with a shortened wind-up. He no-hit the Seattle Mariners 2–0 at Yankee Stadium on May 14; the no-hitter was the first by a Yankee right-hander since Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in the 1956 World Series and the first by a Yankee right-hander during the regular season since Allie Reynolds&#x27; second no-hitter in 1951. He ended the 1996 season at 11–7, his first winning record since 1991, and showed flashes of his early form, going 10–2 with a 3.09 ERA from April 27 through August 12. He proved to be a valuable asset for the Yankees that season as David Cone was out until early September with an aneurysm in his shoulder.

Gooden was left off the 1996 postseason roster due to injury and fatigue. In 1997, he posted a respectable 9–5 record with a 4.91 ERA. He had one start for the Yankees in the 1997 ALDS against the Cleveland Indians; coincidentally, he again faced his 1988 postseason nemesis Orel Hershiser. Gooden left Game 4 during the sixth inning with a 2–1 lead, but the Yankee bullpen faltered in the 8th, and Gooden was left with the no-decision.

=== 1998–1999: Cleveland Indians ===
Gooden then signed with Cleveland and enjoyed moderate success in 1998, going 8–6 with a 3.76 ERA. He started two games in the 1998 postseason, getting a no-decision against the Boston Red Sox and a loss to his former team, the Yankees. He remained with the Indians in 1999 but did not match his respectable numbers from the previous year, going 3–4 with a 6.26 ERA.

In 1999, Gooden released an autobiography titled &quot;Heat&quot;, in which he discussed his struggles with alcohol and cocaine abuse.

=== 2000–2001: Houston, Tampa Bay, and New York Yankees (second stint) ===
Gooden began the 2000 season with two subpar stints with the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Devil Rays but found himself back with the Yankees mid-season. He would go on to have a respectable return with the Yankees, going 4–2 with a 3.36 ERA as a spot starter and long reliever, including a win against his former team, the Mets, on July 8 in the regular-season Subway Series. He made one relief appearance in each of the first two rounds of the playoffs, both times with the Yankees trailing. Gooden did not pitch in the 2000 World Series against the Mets, though 2000 would be the third time Gooden received a World Series ring in his career.

===Postseason career===

Gooden failed to win a postseason game, going 0–4 in the course of nine postseason starts over eight series. In the 1986 National League Championship Series, however, he had an earned run average of only 1.06 after starting two games and allowing just two earned runs in 17 innings pitched.

===Batting and fielding===
For a pitcher, Gooden was an above average hitter, posting a .196 batting average (145-for-741) with 60 runs, 15 doubles, 5 triples, 8 home runs, 67 RBI, and 14 bases on balls. He recorded a .950 fielding percentage, which was five points lower than the league average at his position.

===Retirement===
Gooden retired in early 2001 after he was cut by the Yankees in spring training, ending his career with a record of 194–112. More than half of those wins came before age 25.

Gooden appeared on the 2006 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot. He was named on only 17 ballots, which was 3.3 percent of the 520 writers&#x27; ballots. Because he named on fewer than 5 percent of the ballots, he was removed from future writers ballots.

After retiring, Gooden took a job in the Yankees&#x27; front office. He acted as the go-between man during free agent contract negotiations between his nephew, Gary Sheffield, and the Yankees prior to the 2004 season. In July 2009, he was hired as a vice president of community relations for Atlantic League&#x27;s Newark Bears. He left the post in November of the same year.

Gooden appeared at the Shea Stadium final celebration on September 28, 2008, the first time he had appeared at Shea Stadium since 2000. On April 13, 2009, he made an appearance at the newly opened Citi Field. Gooden spontaneously signed his name to a wall on the inside of the stadium. The Mets initially indicated that they would remove the signature, but soon decided instead to move the part of the wall with Gooden&#x27;s writing to a different area of the stadium and acquire additional signatures from other popular ex-players. On August 1, 2010, he was officially inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame along with Darryl Strawberry, Frank Cashen, and Davey Johnson. That day, Gooden threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Gary Carter.

VH1 announced on June 11, 2011, that Gooden would be a patient on an upcoming season of the reality show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;.

Gooden&#x27;s number 16 was retired by the Mets on April 14, 2024.

==Legal troubles==
In December 1986, Gooden was arrested in Tampa alongside nephew Gary Sheffield and former high school teammate Vance Lovelace after police stopped his Chevrolet Corvette. Gooden was charged with resisting arrest with violence, battery on a police officer, and disorderly conduct. He pleaded no contest in January 1987 and was sentenced to three years probation and 160 hours of community service.

On February 20, 2002, Gooden was arrested in Tampa and charged with driving while intoxicated, having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle, and driving with a suspended license. He was arrested again in January 2003 for driving with a suspended license. On March 12, 2005, Gooden was again arrested in Tampa for punching his girlfriend after she threw a telephone at his head. He was released two days later on a misdemeanor battery charge.

On August 23, 2005, Gooden drove away from a traffic stop in Tampa after being pulled over for driving erratically. He gave the officer his driver&#x27;s license, twice refused to leave his car, and then drove away. The officer remarked in his report that Gooden&#x27;s eyes were glassy and bloodshot, his speech was slurred, and a &quot;strong&quot; odor of alcohol was present on him. Three days after the traffic stop, Gooden turned himself in to police.

Gooden was again arrested in March 2006 for violating his probation, after he arrived high on cocaine at a scheduled meeting with his probation officer. He chose prison over extended probation, perhaps in the hope that incarceration would separate him from the temptations of his addiction. He entered prison on April 17, 2006. On May 31, Gooden said in an interview from prison, &quot;I can&#x27;t come back here ... I&#x27;d rather get shot than come back here ... If I don&#x27;t get the message this time, I never will.&quot; Gooden was released from prison November 9, 2006, after nearly seven months&#x27; incarceration and was not placed on further probation.

On the morning of March 24, 2010, Gooden was arrested in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, near his home , after leaving the scene of a traffic accident, having been located nearby and found to be under the influence of an undisclosed controlled substance. He was charged with DWI with a child passenger, leaving the scene of an accident, and other motor vehicle violations. Gooden was also charged with endangering the welfare of a child because a child was with him at the time of the accident. He later pleaded guilty to child endangerment, received five years&#x27; probation, and was ordered to undergo outpatient drug treatment.

Gooden was arrested for cocaine possession in Holmdel Township, New Jersey on June 7, 2019. Gooden had been stopped by police for driving too slowly and having illegally tinted windows when they discovered two baggies suspected of containing cocaine. Gooden was charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia and driving under the influence. He pleaded guilty to one charge of possessing cocaine in August and was sentenced to a year probation in November 2020.

Another arrest for driving while intoxicated occurred on July 22, 2019, this time in Newark, New Jersey. Gooden had been due in court to answer for the cocaine possession arrest in June the day after his arrest in July.

==In popular culture==
American rock band the Mountain Goats released a song entitled &quot;Doc Gooden&quot; on their 2019 album &quot;In League with Dragons&quot;. Songwriter John Darnielle&#x27;s lyrics reference life as a baseball player.

American rapper Action Bronson mentioned Gooden in his 2015 song &quot;Baby Blue&quot;.

American hiphop group Da Lench Mob referenced Gooden along with Babe Ruth in the 1992 song &quot;You And Your Heroes&quot;.

The baseball video game &quot;MLB Power Pros&quot; uses Gooden&#x27;s Dr. K nickname as the name for an ability that makes pitchers pitch well with two strikes.
