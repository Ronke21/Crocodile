<text>Ann-Marie MacDonald (born October 29, 1958) is a Canadian playwright, author, actress, and broadcast host who lives in Toronto, Ontario. 

==Life and career==
MacDonald is the daughter of a member of Canada&#x27;s military; she was born at an air force base near Baden-Baden, West Germany. She is of partial Lebanese descent through her mother.

MacDonald won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for her first novel, &quot;Fall on Your Knees&quot; (1996), which was selected for Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Book Club in January 2002. 

MacDonald received the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Drama, the Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award, and the Canadian Authors Association Drama Award for her play, &quot;Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)&quot;. 

MacDonald hosted the CBC documentary series &quot;Life and Times&quot; for seven seasons. MacDonald also hosted CBC&#x27;s flagship documentary program, &quot;Doc Zone&quot; for eight seasons. 

She appeared in the films &quot;I&#x27;ve Heard the Mermaids Singing&quot; and &quot;Better Than Chocolate&quot;, among others.

MacDonald&#x27;s 2003 novel, &quot;The Way the Crow Flies&quot;, was partly inspired by the Steven Truscott case. Her third novel &quot;Adult Onset&quot; was released in 2014 and has been translated into five languages. Her fourth novel &quot;Fayne&quot; was published in 2022.

She was the inaugural Mordecai Richler Reading Room Writer in Residence at Concordia University, and she coaches students in the Acting and Playwriting Programs at the National Theatre School of Canada.

In 2008, MacDonald was awarded an honorary doctorate of humanities by the University of Windsor.

In May 2015, MacDonald was the &quot;big-name author&quot; and &quot;public face&quot; of the inaugural Canadian Authors for Indies Day, organized to bring attention to independent bookstores across the country. Nearly 100 stores and 270 authors participated in the nationwide event.

In December 2018, MacDonald was named as an Officer of the Order of Canada, in recognition of &quot;her multi-faceted contributions to the arts in Canada and for her advocacy of LGBTQ+ and women&#x27;s rights&quot;.

In 2019, MacDonald was diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, which affected every aspect of her life, including work. She finished her novel &quot;Fayne&quot; while strapped to a chair in order to be able to type. Her illness caused the novel&#x27;s completion to be delayed by a year. As of 2023, she is symptom-free.

MacDonald is married to the Canadian playwright and theatre director Alisa Palmer.

<text>Sky Lee (born September 15, 1952, as Sharon Lee) is a Canadian artist and novelist. Lee has published both feminist fiction and non-fiction and identifies as lesbian.

==Personal life==
Lee was born September 15, 1952, in Port Alberni, British Columbia. Her mother, Wong Mowe Oi, was a homemaker and her father, Lee Gwei Chang, was a millworker.

Moving to Vancouver in 1967 to attend university, she received a B.A. in Fine Arts at the University of British Columbia and a Diploma in Nursing from Douglas College. She became a member of the Asian Canadian Writers Workshop. Lee lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.

==Career==
Lee was first published as the illustrator of 1983&#x27;s children&#x27;s book, &quot;Teach Me to Fly, Skyfighter!&quot; by Paul Yee. The book is a collection of four stories exploring what it is like to grow up as a Chinese-Canadian in a community with links to both Asian-Canadian and Anglo-Canadian cultures. Reviewer Robert W. Bruinsma argued the book was &quot;modestly illustrated.&quot;

Lee&#x27;s first book, &quot;Disappearing Moon Cafe&quot;, published in 1990, explores the Wong family over four generations, as they operate the titled cafe. Nominated for the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize and the Governor General&#x27;s Award, the novel won the City of Vancouver Book Award despite some critics charging that the writing was over-earnest. For example, critic Gary Draper wrote, &quot;Hardly a noun walks free of a trail of adjectives.&quot; Critic John Z. Ming Chen has studied Lee&#x27;s literary works exhaustively from a Daoist perspective in &quot;The Influence of Daoism on Asian-Canadian Writers&quot; (Mellen, 2008). &quot;Disappearing Moon Café&quot; was reissued in 2017 by NeWest Press with an afterword by Chris Lee and an interview with the author conducted by Smaro Kamboureli.  Chris Lee comments: &quot;SKY Lee&#x27;s novel was a major intervention in contemporary Canadian literature, a bold attempt to account for the role of Chinese migrants in settler colonialism, a feminist interrogation of diaspora, family, and kinship, as well as a gesture towards queer futures.&quot;

In the same year, Lee contributed to the collective prose, &quot;Telling It: Women and Language Across Culture.&quot; The book&#x27;s writing is attributed to the &quot;Telling It Book Collective&quot;, of which Lee was a member. The book explores issues of racism and homophobia experienced by native, lesbian and Asian Canadian women.

In 1994, Lee published &quot;Bellydancer: Stories&quot;, a collection of 15 short stories that explore a range of feminist themes, with allegories focusing primarily on the &quot;bellydancer,&quot; an archetype of survival. The back cover of the book explains: &quot;bellydancing was originally performed at the bedside of women in labor, as an erotic dance of creation.&quot;

Critical Studies:
Dr. John Z. Ming Chen&#x27;s monograph, The Influence of Daoism on Asian-Canadian Writers (2008), features an entire chapter on SKY Lee&#x27;s two book-length works of fiction published so far.

Her short stories have also appeared in &quot;Vancouver Short Stories&quot; as well as periodicals such as &quot;West Coast Line&quot;, &quot;The Asianadian &quot;, &quot;Kinethis&quot;, and &quot;Makara&quot;.

==Bibliography==
*&quot;Teach Me to Fly, Skyfighter!: And Other Stories&quot; (as illustrator, text by Paul Yee) – 1983
*&quot;Disappearing Moon Cafe&quot; – 1990
*&quot;Telling It: Women and Language Across Cultures&quot; – 1990 (with Betsy Warland, Lee Maracle and Daphne Marlatt) Press Gang Publishers

Its site holds a collection of ships and boats and a re-creation of a 19th-century seaport village consisting of more than 60 historic buildings, including many rare commercial structures that were moved to the site and meticulously restored. As of 2016, the museum received about 250,000 visitors each year.

==History==
The museum was established in 1929 as the Marine Historical Association. One founder was philanthropist Mary Stillman Harkness, daughter of the only surviving child of Mystic shipbuilder Thomas Stillman Greenman. Harkness initially donated land that had belonged to her grandfather; in 1945, she would donate his house to the museum as well.

The museum was one of the first living history museums in the United States, with a collection of buildings and craftsmen to show how people lived. It gained fame with its 1941 acquisition of the &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot;, the only surviving wooden whaling ship.

In 1955, maritime history professor Robert G. Albion of Harvard University established the Frank C. Munson Institute of American Maritime Studies, a summer graduate-level academic program.

==Grounds and programs==
The Henry B. du Pont Preservation Shipyard is an important part of the museum, where traditional tools and techniques are used to preserve the museum&#x27;s collection of historic vessels, including the &quot;Charles W. Morgan.&quot; A replica of the slave ship &quot;La Amistad&quot; was constructed in the shipyard and launched in 2000. &quot;Amistad&quot; departed New Haven on June 21, 2007, on a 14,000-mile transatlantic voyage to Great Britain, Lisbon, West Africa, and the Caribbean, marking the Atlantic trade and slave route to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the end of the slave trade in Great Britain.
The 19th-century seafaring village contains nearly all the types of general and specialized trades associated with building and operating a sailing fleet. They include a chandlery, sail loft, ropewalk, cooperage, shipping agent&#x27;s office, printing office, bank, and others. Also included is The Spouter Tavern, which is open seasonally and serving &quot;travelers&#x27; fare&quot;. Each building is used to show the original activity and also to display examples of what was sold or constructed; the nautical instrument shop, for example, displays sextants, nautical timepieces, and so forth, while demonstrations at the cooperage show how casks were assembled.


Additional buildings house more exhibits. A 40-foot, scale model of the Mystic River area as it appeared around 1870, complete down to the outhouses that stood behind every residence. Another contains a collection of carved ship figureheads. Also among the museum&#x27;s buildings is the Treworgy Planetarium which demonstrates how seamen used stars for navigation.

Sailing instruction is also offered, as well as tourist rides in various historical small craft that allow views of historic ships at their moorings. Mystic Seaport&#x27;s music program features sea shanties in their original contexts as work songs.

The Seaport supports research via an extensive library.

With Williams College, the museum hosts Williams–Mystic, an undergraduate program in maritime studies.

Outreach includes sailing and history classes for area children.

<doc id="285396" wikidata="Q335931" url="?curid=285396" title="Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917">
<text>The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) of 1917 (, codified at and et seq.) is a United States federal law, enacted on October 6, 1917, in response to the United States declaration of war on Germany on April 6, 1917. It continues to give the President of the United States the power to oversee or restrict any and all trade between the United States and its enemies in times of war. TWEA was amended in 1933 by the Emergency Banking Act to extend the president’s authority also in peace time. It was amended again in 1977 by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to restrict again the application of TWEA only to times of war, while the IEEPA was intended to be used in peace time.

TWEA is sometimes confused with the IEEPA, which grants somewhat broader powers to the President, and which is invoked during states of emergency when the United States is not at war. The IEEPA was passed in an attempt to rein in perceived abuses by the US President of the TWEA by making the powers subject to the National Emergencies Act (NEA). The NEA included a legislative veto to allow Congress to terminate a national emergency with a concurrent resolution. However, the U.S. Supreme Court found such legislative vetoes unconstitutional in &quot;Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha&quot;. Following the Court&#x27;s decision, Congress amended the NEA to require a joint resolution.

The law set the basis for sanctions by the United States. As of 2023, Cuba is the only country restricted under TWEA. North Korea was removed from the provisions of TWEA in 2008, although restrictions under IEEPA authority remain in effect.

==History==
The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917. TWEA was enacted on October 6, 1917. By executive order on October 12, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson created the War Trade Board under Vance McCormick, with the authority to control all US imports and exports. This sought to conserve supplies and shipping for Allied use, and prevent goods from arriving in enemy hands by, for example, restricting supplies to Germany&#x27;s neutral trading partners. On October 22, 1917, by Executive Order 2729-A he also created the Office of Alien Property Custodian (APC) under TWEA with power to confiscate property from anyone whose actions might be considered a possible threat to the war effort. Initially, the Custodian confiscated the property of interned natives of Germany and of businesses, such as the Bayer chemical company. On December 7, 1917, the United States declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the other Central Power.

In 1933, newly-elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Proclamation 2039, which declared a national emergency and imposed a bank holiday. The proclamation cited TWEA (obliquely referenced as the &quot;Act of October 6, 1917&quot;) as the basis of his authority. Aware that such action was legally dubious since the United States was not at war, Roosevelt asked Congress to ratify his actions by passing the Emergency Banking Relief Act, which amended TWEA to enable its use during any &quot;period of national emergency declared by the President.&quot; President Franklin D. Roosevelt, using these new authorities, issued Executive Order 6102 to limit gold ownership. These restrictions continued until January 1, 1975. The TWEA has been amended several other times.

During and after both World Wars, property frozen by the United States, belonging to neutral or allied nations, was returned and property belonging to enemy nations was continuously confiscated until hostilities ceased. Some of the confiscated enemy property would not be returned later. Agreements to return some or most assets in exchange for seized American assets and reparations for war-damaged American interests by the new governments of the former enemy nations were later concluded. Nations or organizations that were deemed less responsible for starting the wars receive much more favorable treatment.
The United States instituted the Italian Enemy Act of 1947 to deal with former members of the Mussolini regime from controlling interest in U.S. based businesses under the TWEA Act of 1917.

On December 16, 1950, the United States imposed economic sanctions against North Korea under TWEA, which lasted until 2008.

On May 13, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson abolished the Office of Alien Property Custodian by Executive Order 11281, effective June 30 of that year.

On August 15, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon issued Proclamation 4074, which declared a national emergency under TWEA and imposed a 10% ad valorem supplemental duty on all dutiable articles imported into the United States.

== Countries sanctioned under the Trading with the Enemy Act ==

=== Albania ===
Albania was invaded by the Central Powers during WW1. While the Central Powers occupied Albania, its assets from the areas they occupied were frozen to prevent the Central Powers from using Albanian assets. Because of this policy, once Central Powers occupation ended the sanctions were effectively lifted.

During WW2, Albania was listed in 1941, to prevent its assets from being used first by the invading fascist Italy and then by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Andorra ===
Andorra remained officially neutral during WW2. However, it was a tiny country between Axis-friendly Spain and the German puppet state Vichy France. Andorra was listed in 1941, to prevent its assets from being used by Nazi Germany and Vichy France, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Austria ===
Austria was invaded and annexed by Germany. It was listed in 1941, to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Austro-Hungarian Empire ===
The Austro-Hungarian Empire was sanctioned in 1917 as an enemy state. It continued to be sanctioned until after its defeat and dissolution in 1918 into Austria and Hungary. The United States remained at &quot;war&quot; with the then-nonexistent dissolved country for several years until deciding to ratify peace treaties with Austria and Hungary separately 1921. No actual combat is known to have taken place between the United States and Austria or Hungary after the empire&#x27;s dissolution and before the ratification of the peace treaties.

=== Belgium ===
Belgium&#x27;s property was frozen in the event the property was from the areas the invading Central Powers occupied during WW1 to prevent the Central Powers from using its assets. If the area was not occupied, the assets were not frozen. Because of this policy, once Central Powers occupation ended the sanctions were effectively lifted.

Belgium was listed again in 1940, to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria was a German and Austro-Hungarian ally during WW1 and some of its property was frozen or confiscated by the United States. The United States and Bulgaria avoided declaring war on each other during WW1.

During WW2 Bulgaria was an axis power and was sanctioned again in 1941. Sanctions were lifted in 1945. In 1963 the government of Bulgaria agreed to accept American claims for lost property and war damages so the Bulgarians were allowed to reclaim the property America seized during WW2.

=== Cambodia ===
Cambodia was sanctioned in 1975 as a result of the Vietnam War. Trading With the Enemy Act sanctions were lifted in 1992.

=== China ===
China was listed on two occasions. The Republic of China was first listed in 1941 to prevent invading Japan from using Chinese assets during WW2. China was delisted in 1946. After WW2 the People&#x27;s Republic of China was sanctioned and listed in 1950 for their involvement in the Korean War. After President Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;opening with China&quot; sanctions were lifted in 1975.

=== Cuba ===
Following the Cuban missile crisis, the Bay of Pigs invasion, and the nationalization of U.S. property by the Castro regime, the United States imposed sanctions on Cuba in 1963. TWEA sanctions continued throughout the Cold War because the US and Cuba often found themselves on opposite sides in various proxy conflicts throughout Latin America and Africa. The sanctions on Cuba were increased after the Cuban air force killed American protesters who were known to violate Cuban airspace. Cuba is currently the only state still under sanctions under TWEA.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
Czechoslovakia was invaded and annexed by Germany. In 1941 it was listed to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany. Czechoslovakia was delisted in 1946. Czechoslovakian assets were held until the government of Czechoslovakia agreed to return assets its German installed occupation government expropriated during WW2. These restrictions were lifted sometime between 1964 and 1967 after an agreement was reached.

=== Danzig ===
Danzig was listed in 1941 to prevent its assets from being used by Nazi Germany. Germany was forced to give up the city of Danzig after WWI. As a result of it being a former German city, there was a considerable amount of support for Nazi Germany to re-annex the territory within the mostly ethnic German Free City of Danzig. The annexation of Danzig happened early in WWII. Sanctions were continued until Danzig ceased to exist. Danzig was made part of Poland and renamed Gdańsk. Danzig&#x27;s German inhabitants were expelled to Germany as part of the Soviet proposal to prevent the German diaspora outside German borders after WW1 from helping start another world war by requesting annexation.

=== Denmark ===
Denmark was listed in 1940 to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946.

=== East Germany ===
East Germany, or eastern Germany before 1949, and East Berlin-origin assets were held until the government of East German agreed to return assets the Nazi German government expropriated during WW2. These restrictions were lifted sometime between 1964 and 1967 after an agreement was reached.

=== Estonia ===
Estonia was listed in 1940, to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946. Estonian assets were held until the government of Estonia agreed to return assets its German-installed occupation government expropriated during WW2. These restrictions were lifted sometime between 1964 and 1967 after an agreement was reached.

=== Finland ===
Finland was invaded in 1939 by the Soviet Union. As a result of this, it allied itself with Germany against the Soviet Union during most of World War 2. It was consequently sanctioned in 1941. Finland was considered an ally of an enemy under TWTEA until the Lapland war in which Finland changed sides. Finland would have then been eligible for the classification of &quot;allies or neutrals&quot; and delisted with the rest of that group in 1946.

=== France ===
During WW1, France&#x27;s property was frozen in the event the property was from the areas occupied by the invading Central Powers to prevent the Central Powers from using its assets. If the area was not occupied, the assets were not frozen. Because of this policy, once the Central Powers&#x27; occupation ended the sanctions were effectively lifted.

During WW2, France was listed in 1940 to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany. France was delisted in 1946.

=== Germany ===
The Empire of Germany was first sanctioned in 1917 for its role in WW1. Germany remained sanctioned until a U.S.-German peace treaty was ratified in 1921.

Nazi Germany was sanctioned again in 1941 for its role in WW2. Sanctions were lifted in 1946 by Executive Order 9788 and the Office of Alien Property created in the Department of Justice. As Germany was judged to have a primary role in starting both world wars, the United States policy was to confiscate and sell off German assets that Germans acquired before 1946. The War Claims Act of 1948 distributed the vested property if a claim could be established.

=== Greece ===
Greece was listed in 1941, to prevent assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Hong Kong ===
Hong Kong was listed in 1941, to prevent its assets from being used by invading Japan, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Haiti===
The military government of Haiti led by General Raoul Cedras and affiliated members such as the CIA-created FRAPH, was listed under the International Economic Powers Act (IEPA Act), now with the Trading With the Enemy Act that has its roots in World War I and the EIPA Act during the Cold War between the US and the former Soviet Union. Many members of the Haitian Army who had properties in the US, their properties either frozen or confiscated by the Clinton administration until they agreed to the return of deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

=== Hungary ===
Hungary was an Axis power and was sanctioned in 1941. Sanctions were lifted in 1945. Hungarian assets were held until the government of Hungary agreed to return assets it expropriated during WW2 and accept claims for war damages caused by Hungary.

=== Italy ===
Italy was an axis power until Italy was invaded and Mussolini&#x27;s government deposed. Italy was sanctioned in 1941. Sanctions were lifted in 1943 after the allies installed a friendly government and it switched sides. Italy accepted an agreement to return expropriated American property and accept claims for war damages so it was allowed to reclaim its seized property.

=== Japan ===
In 1940 US President Franklin D. Roosevelt sanctioned Japan to punish it for invading China and French Indochina under the Export Control Act. In 1941, Roosevelt imposed sanctions under TWEA. Some claim that this was the reason for the attack on Pearl Harbor later in 1941. Sanctions were lifted in 1946. Japan was widely unpopular for the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Because Japan was the reason for the United States entering World War II, and due to the fact many Americans wanted to stay out of European wars during both wartime periods, Japanese assets that the Japanese acquired before 1946 were confiscated and divested. The War Claims Act of 1948 distributed the vested property if a claim could be established.

=== Latvia ===
Latvia was listed in 1940, to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946. Latvian assets were held until the government of Latvia agreed to return assets its German-installed occupation government expropriated during WW2. These restrictions were lifted sometime between 1964 and 1967 after an agreement was reached.

=== Liechtenstein ===
Liechtenstein was listed in 1941. Liechtenstein was perceived to be on Germany&#x27;s side by some allies even though it remained neutral. Liechtenstein was delisted in 1946.

=== Lithuania ===
Lithuania was listed in 1940, to prevent assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946. Lithuanian assets were held until the government of Lithuania agreed to return assets its German-installed occupation government expropriated during WW2. These restrictions were lifted sometime between 1964 and 1967 after an agreement was reached.

=== Luxembourg ===
Luxembourg was listed in 1940, to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Monaco ===
Monaco was listed in 1940, to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany, and was delisted in 1946.

=== Montenegro ===
Montenegro was invaded by the central powers during WWI. While the central powers occupied Montenegro, its assets from the areas they occupied were frozen to prevent the central powers from using Montenegrin assets. Because of this policy, once the Central Powers&#x27; occupation ended the sanctions were effectively lifted.

=== North Korea ===

North Korea was sanctioned in 1950 for aggression in the Korean War. The war is still officially in effect, with no peace treaty signed, and the sanctions has been kept due to North Korean terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and continued aggression toward the United States. Trading with the Enemy Act sanctions were lifted in 2008 in response to North Korea&#x27;s steps toward nuclear disarmament and commitments to continue dismantling its nuclear weapons program. However, North Korea later developed and tested several more nuclear weapons, indicating that it was lying. North Korea&#x27;s designation was grandfathered from an old version of the law that allowed it to be used absent a declaration of war. Because there is no declaration of war between the United States and North Korea, TWEA sanctions cannot be reapplied, but it was re-sanctioned for reneging on its commitments through the IEEPA, along with other laws, and through UN Security Council resolutions.

=== North Vietnam ===
North Vietnam was sanctioned in 1964 during the Vietnam War. Sanctions were continued until North Vietnam ceased to exist and were inherited by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

=== Norway ===
Norway was listed in 1940 to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany. Norway was delisted in 1946.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
The Ottoman Empire was in the Central Powers, an ally of the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Bulgaria, which was sanctioned alongside its allies in 1917 with the act, though entering the war later on. The Ottoman Empire and the United States are not known to have fought each other during the war, except for smaller-scaled naval conflicts and bombardments. And little, if any, property was seized from Ottomans as the Ottoman Empire had few resources to be seized that would contribute to the war and economic effort within the United States. 

It was judged by the Office of the Alien Property Custodian that seizing the small amount of non-war related Ottoman property that was present in the United States at that time was counter-productive and would later on likely invite the Ottoman Empire onto seizing a larger amount of American property back as in-advance. Thus, the United States didn&#x27;t want to provoke the Ottomans in such a way that would result in them possibly targeting US affiliates, companies, property and citizens living within the lands &amp; areas they controlled in many ways, and prompt unnecessary mutual declarations of war.

They remained sanctioned even after their defeat by signing the Mudros Armistice in 1918 until their dissolution with the later-to-be revoked Peace Treaty of Sevrés in 1921 when the sanctions were no longer in effect. 

The Americans were not going to be directly involved in the Turkish War of Independence which would follow after the signing of Sevrés, nor implement any official sanctions but would support Ententé and Greek forces. Although not officially, a significant portion of the American Congress would later go on to criticise and proclaim the Lausanne Declaration Treaty that would follow after the independence war as invalid, rejecting it by still supporting the post-European and colonial claims on Turkish lands in the Balkans and the Anatoli.

These rejections would later be disregarded, and the United States of America formally established normal &amp; friendly relations with the newly established modern, and more Western-sided Turkish Republic in 1927.

Thus, the new Republic of Turkey was not affected by any American or Allied sanctions anymore, either shortly after the end of the Independence War and the signing of the Lausanne Treaty or during WWII.

=== Poland ===
Poland was listed in 1941 to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany. Poland was delisted in 1946.

=== Portugal ===
Portugal was listed in 1941. While neutral, it traded raw materials used in military production with Germany, though it gave much more assistance and trade to the Allies than the Axis. Portugal was delisted in 1948.

=== Romania ===
Romania was invaded by the central powers during World War I. While the central powers occupied Romania, its assets from the areas they occupied were frozen to prevent the central powers from using Romanian assets. Because of this policy, the sanctions were effectively lifted once the Central Powers&#x27; occupation ended.

In World War II Romania was an Axis power and sanctioned in 1940. Sanctions were lifted in 1945. Romanian assets were held until the government of Romania agreed to return assets its government expropriated during World War II and accept claims for war damage caused by Romania.

Romania has a long history of being misspelled by previous members of the government of the United States. Rumania and Roumania are common misspellings used in government documents.

=== Russia ===
The Russian Empire&#x27;s property was frozen in the event the property was from the areas the invading Central Powers occupied during WW1 to prevent the Central Powers from using Russian assets. If the area was not occupied, the assets were not frozen. Because of this policy, once the Central Powers&#x27; occupation ended the sanctions were effectively lifted.

=== San Marino ===
San Marino was listed in 1941. San Marino was perceived to be part of the Axis, though it remained neutral. San Marino was delisted in 1946.

=== Serbia ===
Serbia was invaded by the central powers during World War I. While the central powers occupied Serbia, its assets from the areas they occupied were frozen to prevent the central powers from using Serb assets. Because of this policy, once the Central Powers&#x27; occupation ended the sanctions were effectively lifted.

=== Spain ===
Spain was listed in 1941 for aiding the Axis though officially remaining neutral. Spain was delisted in 1946.

=== Sweden ===
Sweden was listed in 1941. While Sweden was officially neutral, it aided both sides during WWII to avoid being at war with either. Sweden was delisted in 1946.

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland was listed in 1941. Although neutral during WWII, it engaged in combat against both sides for infringing on its airspace or territory. Switzerland was delisted in 1946.

=== Thailand ===
Thailand was sanctioned in 1941. Thailand was invaded by the Japanese and as a negotiated settlement to the conflict, they became a Japanese ally during WW2. After Japan was defeated, Thailand&#x27;s subsequent prime minister said the previous government didn&#x27;t get a valid declaration of war and the previous prime minister&#x27;s unilateral declaration was null and void. The Office of Alien Property considered Thailand enemy-occupied instead of an enemy power so it was delisted in 1946 and eligible to get its property back.

=== The Netherlands ===
The Netherlands was listed in 1940 to prevent its assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany. The Netherlands was delisted in 1946.

=== Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ===
The Soviet Union was sanctioned several times under this act, though for a relatively short period. It was first listed in 1941 to prevent assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany and other invading axis powers. The Soviet Union was delisted in 1946. Later it was sanctioned during four brief periods from 1972 to 1976 when other Presidential economic powers lapsed due to not being renewed by Congress during the Cold War.

=== United States ===
Franklin D. Roosevelt used the Trading with the Enemy Act to shut down financial institutions and declare a &quot;bank holiday&quot; to prevent runs on the banks during the Great Depression in 1933. It was also used to outlaw most ownership of gold in an attempt to prop up the gold-backed dollar. The gold ownership ban was lifted by congressional amendment and gold was no longer used to back printed dollars.

In 1968 Lyndon Johnson used the law to restrict capital exports.

In 1971 Nixon used the TWEA for currency manipulation in an attempt to boost US exports.

In 1982 the United States Treasury Department announced the termination of the Presidential Proclamations and executive orders for the emergencies relating to the 1933 Great Depression ending all domestically oriented TWEA related programs.

=== Vietnam ===
The Socialist Republic of Vietnam was sanctioned in 1975 as a result of the Vietnam War. TWEA sanctions were lifted in 1994.

=== Yugoslavia ===
Yugoslavia was listed in 1941 to prevent assets from being used by the invading Nazi Germany. Yugoslavia was delisted in 1946.

<text>Richard Dyer-Bennet (6 October 1913 in Leicester, England – 14 December 1991 in Monterey, Massachusetts) was an English-born American folk singer (or his own preferred term, &quot;minstrel&quot;), recording artist, and voice teacher.

==Early life==
He was born on 6 October 1913 in Leicester, England, as the eldest son of Miriam Wolcott Clapp and Richard Stewart Dyer-Bennet (1886–1983), a Major in the Leicester Regiment who was wounded twice while fighting in World War I. His paternal grandfather was Frederick Stewart Hotham Dyer-Bennet (a grandson of Sir Thomas Swinnerton Dyer, 9th Baronet). Dyer-Bennet grew up in Germany, Canada and California. He studied voice with Gertrude Wheeler Beckman and Sven Scholander. 

The meeting with Scholander had a profound effect on Dyer-Bennet, who later recalled: 

&quot;He looked straight at me and spun tale after tale as though singing out of his own life. He sang of soldiers, sailors, young lovers; he sang dialogues between mother and daughter, altercations between birds and animals, descriptions of mountain and countryside. A pageant of the ages seemed to pass before my eyes, and it was all evoked by the husky voice of this old man and by his simple but exactly appropriate accompaniments on the lute.&quot;

==Career==
His first album released included the song, The Lonesome Valley, used for many years to sign off the Midnight Special on WFMT each Saturday night. A favorite interview of Studs Terkel.

He had a stroke in 1972 paralyzing his left side and he stopped giving concerts.

===Legacy===
During his peak performance years, he gave 50 concerts a year. He recorded extensively for many labels, and eventually founded his own, Dyer-Bennet Records, recording in his own living room. The albums he recorded on his own label have been re-released on CD by Smithsonian Folkways. The CD &quot;Richard Dyer-Bennet 1&quot; includes a biographical essay written by Dyer-Bennet&#x27;s daughter, Bonnie, which highlights his progressive politics and his battle with a debilitating stroke in later life (he taught himself to play harp one-handed so that he could continue to perform and teach). A biography – &quot;Richard Dyer-Bennet: The Last Minstrel&quot; – by Paul O Jenkins was published in December 2009 by the University Press of Mississippi. The book chronicles Dyer-Bennet&#x27;s eventful life and includes a foreword by his daughter.

==Personal life==

In 1936, Dyer-Bennet married Elizabeth Hoar Pepper. They divorced in 1941. He married Melvene Ipcar in 1942, they had two daughters Brooke and Bonnie.

He was heir presumptive of the Dyer baronets from 1983 until his death. He died of cancer on 14 December 1991 at his home in Monterey, Massachusetts.

<doc id="285422" wikidata="Q804316" url="?curid=285422" title="Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula">
<text>In mathematics, the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula gives the value of formula_1 that solves the equation
formula_2
for possibly noncommutative and in the Lie algebra of a Lie group. There are various ways of writing the formula, but all ultimately yield an expression for formula_1 in Lie algebraic terms, that is, as a formal series (not necessarily convergent) in formula_4 and formula_5 and iterated commutators thereof. The first few terms of this series are:
formula_6
where &quot;formula_7&quot; indicates terms involving higher commutators of formula_4 and formula_5. If formula_4 and formula_5 are sufficiently small elements of the Lie algebra formula_12 of a Lie group formula_13, the series is convergent. Meanwhile, every element formula_14 sufficiently close to the identity in formula_13 can be expressed as formula_16 for a small formula_4 in formula_12. Thus, we can say that &quot;near the identity&quot; the group multiplication in formula_13—written as formula_20—can be expressed in purely Lie algebraic terms. The Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula can be used to give comparatively simple proofs of deep results in the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence.

If formula_4 and formula_5 are sufficiently small formula_23 matrices, then formula_1 can be computed as the logarithm of formula_25, where the exponentials and the logarithm can be computed as power series. The point of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula is then the highly nonobvious claim that formula_26 can be expressed as a series in repeated commutators of formula_4 and formula_5.

Modern expositions of the formula can be found in, among other places, the books of Rossmann and Hall.

== History ==
The formula is named after Henry Frederick Baker, John Edward Campbell, and Felix Hausdorff who stated its qualitative form, i.e. that only commutators and commutators of commutators, ad infinitum, are needed to express the solution. An earlier statement of the form was adumbrated by Friedrich Schur in 1890 where a convergent power series is given, with terms recursively defined. This qualitative form is what is used in the most important applications, such as the relatively accessible proofs of the Lie correspondence and in quantum field theory. Following Schur, it was noted in print by Campbell (1897); elaborated by Henri Poincaré (1899) and Baker (1902); and systematized geometrically, and linked to the Jacobi identity by Hausdorff (1906). The first actual explicit formula, with all numerical coefficients, is due to Eugene Dynkin (1947). The history of the formula is described in detail in the article of Achilles and Bonfiglioli and in the book of Bonfiglioli and Fulci.

== Explicit forms ==
For many purposes, it is only necessary to know that an expansion for formula_1 in terms of iterated commutators of formula_4 and formula_5 exists; the exact coefficients are often irrelevant. (See, for example, the discussion of the relationship between Lie group and Lie algebra homomorphisms in Section 5.2 of Hall&#x27;s book, where the precise coefficients play no role in the argument.) A remarkably direct existence proof was given by Martin Eichler, see also the &quot;Existence results&quot; section below.

In other cases, one may need detailed information about formula_1 and it is therefore desirable to compute formula_1 as explicitly as possible. Numerous formulas exist; we will describe two of the main ones (Dynkin&#x27;s formula and the integral formula of Poincaré) in this section.

===Dynkin&#x27;s formula===
Let &quot;G&quot; be a Lie group with Lie algebra formula_12. Let
formula_35
be the exponential map.
The following general combinatorial formula was introduced by Eugene Dynkin (1947),
formula_36
where the sum is performed over all nonnegative values of formula_37 and formula_38, and the following notation has been used:
formula_39
with the understanding that .

The series is not convergent in general; it is convergent (and the stated formula is valid) for all sufficiently small formula_4 and formula_5.
Since , the term is zero if formula_42 or if formula_43 and formula_44.

The first few terms are well-known, with all higher-order terms involving and commutator nestings thereof (thus in the Lie algebra):

The above lists all summands of order 6 or lower (i.e. those containing 6 or fewer &#x27;s and &#x27;s). The (anti-)/symmetry in alternating orders of the expansion, follows from . A complete elementary proof of this formula can be found in the article on the derivative of the exponential map.

===An integral formula===
There are numerous other expressions for formula_1, many of which are used in the physics literature. A popular integral formula is
formula_46
involving the generating function for the Bernoulli numbers,
formula_47
utilized by Poincaré and Hausdorff.

=== Matrix Lie group illustration ===
For a matrix Lie group formula_48 the Lie algebra is the tangent space of the identity &quot;I&quot;, and the commutator is simply ; the exponential map is the standard exponential map of matrices,
formula_49

When one solves for &quot;Z&quot; in
formula_50
using the series expansions for and one obtains a simpler formula:
formula_51
The first, second, third, and fourth order terms are:
* formula_52
* formula_53
* formula_54
* formula_55

The formulas for the various formula_56&#x27;s is &quot;not&quot; the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula. Rather, the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula is one of various expressions for formula_56&#x27;s &quot;in terms of repeated commutators of formula_4 and formula_5&quot;. The point is that it is far from obvious that it is possible to express each formula_56 in terms of commutators. (The reader is invited, for example, to verify by direct computation that formula_61 is expressible as a linear combination of the two nontrivial third-order commutators of formula_4 and formula_5, namely formula_64 and formula_65.) The general result that each formula_56 is expressible as a combination of commutators was shown in an elegant, recursive way by Eichler.

A consequence of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula is the following result about the trace:
formula_67
That is to say, since each formula_56 with formula_69 is expressible as a linear combination of commutators, the trace of each such terms is zero.

=== Questions of convergence ===
Suppose formula_4 and formula_5 are the following matrices in the Lie algebra formula_72 (the space of formula_73 matrices with trace zero):
formula_74
Then
formula_75
It is then not hard to show that there does not exist a matrix formula_1 in formula_77 with formula_20. (Similar examples may be found in the article of Wei.)

This simple example illustrates that the various versions of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula, which give expressions for in terms of iterated Lie-brackets of and , describe &quot;formal&quot; power series whose convergence is not guaranteed. Thus, if one wants to be an actual element of the Lie algebra containing and (as opposed to a formal power series), one has to assume that and are small. Thus, the conclusion that the product operation on a Lie group is determined by the Lie algebra is only a local statement. Indeed, the result cannot be global, because globally one can have nonisomorphic Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras.

Concretely, if working with a matrix Lie algebra and formula_79 is a given submultiplicative matrix norm, convergence is guaranteed if
formula_80

== Special cases ==
If formula_4 and formula_5 commute, that is formula_83, the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula reduces to formula_84.

Another case assumes that formula_85 commutes with both formula_4 and formula_5, as for the nilpotent Heisenberg group. Then the formula reduces to its &quot;first three terms&quot;.

This is the degenerate case used routinely in quantum mechanics, as illustrated below and is sometimes known as the disentangling theorem. In this case, there are no smallness restrictions on formula_4 and formula_5. This result is behind the &quot;exponentiated commutation relations&quot; that enter into the Stone–von Neumann theorem. A simple proof of this identity is given below.

Another useful form of the general formula emphasizes expansion in terms of &quot;Y&quot; and uses the adjoint mapping notation formula_90:
formula_91
which is evident from the integral formula above. (The coefficients of the nested commutators with a single formula_5 are normalized Bernoulli numbers.)

Now assume that the commutator is a multiple of formula_5, so that formula_94. Then all iterated commutators will be multiples of formula_5, and no quadratic or higher terms in formula_5 appear. Thus, the formula_97 term above vanishes and we obtain:

Y\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Again, in this case there are no smallness restriction on formula_4 and formula_5. The restriction on formula_100 guarantees that the expression on the right side makes sense. (When formula_101 we may interpret formula_102.) We also obtain a simple &quot;braiding identity&quot;:
formula_103
which may be written as an adjoint dilation:
formula_104

== Existence results ==

If formula_4 and formula_5 are matrices, one can compute formula_26 using the power series for the exponential and logarithm, with convergence of the series if formula_4 and formula_5 are sufficiently small. It is natural to collect together all terms where the total degree in formula_4 and formula_5 equals a fixed number formula_112, giving an expression formula_113. (See the section &quot;Matrix Lie group illustration&quot; above for formulas for the first several formula_113&#x27;s.) A remarkably direct and concise, recursive proof that each formula_113 is expressible in terms of repeated commutators of formula_4 and formula_5 was given by Martin Eichler.

Alternatively, we can give an existence argument as follows. The Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula implies that if and are in some Lie algebra formula_118 defined over any field of characteristic 0 like formula_119 or formula_120, then
formula_121
can formally be written as an infinite sum of elements of formula_12. [This infinite series may or may not converge, so it need not define an actual element in formula_12.] For many applications, the mere assurance of the existence of this formal expression is sufficient, and an explicit expression for this infinite sum is not needed. This is for instance the case in the Lorentzian construction of a Lie group representation from a Lie algebra representation. Existence can be seen as follows.

We consider the ring formula_124 of all non-commuting formal power series with real coefficients in the non-commuting variables and . There is a ring homomorphism from to the tensor product of with over ,
formula_125
called the coproduct, such that
formula_126 and formula_127
(The definition of Δ is extended to the other elements of &quot;S&quot; by requiring &quot;R&quot;-linearity, multiplicativity and infinite additivity.)

One can then verify the following properties:
* The map , defined by its standard Taylor series, is a bijection between the set of elements of with constant term 0 and the set of elements of with constant term 1; the inverse of exp is log
* formula_128 is &quot;grouplike&quot; (this means formula_129) if and only if &quot;s&quot; is &quot;primitive&quot; (this means formula_130).
* The grouplike elements form a group under multiplication.
* The primitive elements are &quot;exactly the formal infinite sums of elements of the Lie algebra&quot; generated by &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, where the Lie bracket is given by the commutator formula_131. (Friedrichs&#x27; theorem)

The existence of the Campbell–Baker–Hausdorff formula can now be seen as follows:
The elements &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are primitive, so formula_132 and formula_133 are grouplike; so their product formula_134 is also grouplike; so its logarithm formula_135 is primitive; and hence can be written as an infinite sum of elements of the Lie algebra generated by and .

The universal enveloping algebra of the free Lie algebra generated by and is isomorphic to the algebra of all non-commuting polynomials in and . In common with all universal enveloping algebras, it has a natural structure of a Hopf algebra, with a coproduct . The ring used above is just a completion of this Hopf algebra.

== Zassenhaus formula ==
A related combinatoric expansion that is useful in dual applications is
formula_136
where the exponents of higher order in are likewise nested commutators, i.e., homogeneous Lie polynomials.
These exponents, in , follow recursively by application of the above BCH expansion.

As a corollary of this, the Suzuki–Trotter decomposition follows.

== Campbell identity ==
The following identity (Campbell 1897) leads to a special case of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula.
Let be a matrix Lie group and its corresponding Lie algebra. Let be the linear operator on defined by for some fixed . (The adjoint endomorphism encountered above.) Denote with for fixed the linear transformation of given by .

A standard combinatorial lemma which is utilized in producing the above explicit expansions is given by

This is a particularly useful formula which is commonly used to conduct unitary transforms in quantum mechanics. By defining the iterated commutator,
formula_137
we can write this formula more compactly as,
formula_138

===An application of the identity===
For central, i.e., commuting with both and ,
formula_139
Consequently, for , it follows that
formula_140
whose solution is
formula_141
Taking formula_142 gives one of the special cases of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula described above:
formula_143

More generally, for non-central , we have
formula_144
which can be written as the following braiding identity:
formula_145

==Infinitesimal case==

A particularly useful variant of the above is the infinitesimal form. This is commonly written as
formula_146
This variation is commonly used to write coordinates and vielbeins as pullbacks of the metric on a Lie group. 

For example, writing formula_147 for some functions formula_148 and a basis formula_149 for the Lie algebra, one readily computes that
formula_150
for formula_151 the structure constants of the Lie algebra. 

The series can be written more compactly (cf. main article) as 
formula_152
with the infinite series 
formula_153
Here, is a matrix whose matrix elements are formula_154. 

The usefulness of this expression comes from the fact that the matrix is a vielbein. Thus, given some map formula_155 from some manifold to some manifold , the metric tensor on the manifold can be written as the pullback of the metric tensor formula_156 on the Lie group , 
formula_157
The metric tensor formula_156 on the Lie group is the Cartan metric, the Killing form. For a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the metric is a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric.

== Application in quantum mechanics ==
A special case of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula is useful in quantum mechanics and especially quantum optics, where and are Hilbert space operators, generating the Heisenberg Lie algebra. Specifically, the position and momentum operators in quantum mechanics, usually denoted formula_4 and formula_160, satisfy the canonical commutation relation:
formula_161
where formula_162 is the identity operator. It follows that formula_4 and formula_160 commute with their commutator. Thus, if we &quot;formally&quot; applied a special case of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula (even though formula_4 and formula_160 are unbounded operators and not matrices), we would conclude that
formula_167
This &quot;exponentiated commutation relation&quot; does indeed hold, and forms the basis of the Stone–von Neumann theorem. 
Further, formula_168
A related application is the annihilation and creation operators, and . Their commutator is &quot;central&quot;, that is, it commutes with both and . As indicated above, the expansion then collapses to the semi-trivial degenerate form:
formula_169
where is just a complex number.

This example illustrates the resolution of the displacement operator, , into exponentials of annihilation and creation operators and scalars.

This degenerate Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula then displays the product of two displacement operators as another displacement operator (up to a phase factor), with the resultant displacement equal to the sum of the two displacements,
formula_170
since the Heisenberg group they provide a representation of is nilpotent. The degenerate Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula is frequently used in quantum field theory as well.

<text>The  (singular: , ), also rendered as Landsknechts or Lansquenets, were German mercenaries used in pike and shot formations during the early modern period. Consisting predominantly of pikemen and supporting foot soldiers, their front line was formed by &quot;Doppelsöldner&quot; (&quot;double-pay men&quot;) renowned for their use of &quot;Zweihänder&quot; and arquebus. They formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s Imperial Army from the late 15th century to the early 17th century, fighting in the Habsburg-Valois wars, the Habsburg-Ottoman wars, and the European wars of religion.

Although prone to mutiny if unpaid and divided within their ranks between Catholics and Lutherans, the &quot;Landsknechte&quot; were well-armed and experienced warriors, recruitable in large numbers throughout Germany and Austria by the Holy Roman Emperor. This guaranteed both quantity and quality to the Imperial military for a century and a half. At their peak during the reign of Charles V of Habsburg, and under the leadership of notable captains such as Georg von Frundsberg and Nicholas of Salm, the Imperial Landsknechts obtained important successes such as the capture of the French King Francis I at the Battle of Pavia in 1525 and the resistance against the Ottoman Turks led by Suleiman the Magnificent at the Siege of Vienna in 1529, while also being responsible for the Sack of Rome in 1527.

==Etymology==

The Germanic compound (earlier &quot;Lantknecht&quot;, without Fugen-&quot;s&quot;) combines &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; to form &quot;servant of the land&quot;. The compound &quot;Lantknecht&quot; was used during the 15th century for bailiffs or court ushers.

The word first appeared in the German language circa 1470 to describe certain troops in the army of Charles, Duke of Burgundy. As early as 1500, the term was morphed into &quot;Lanzknecht&quot;, referring to the unit&#x27;s use of the pike as its main weapon.

==History==
Over the Burgundian Wars, the well-organized and supplied armies of Charles the Bold were defeated again and again by the Swiss Confederation, which wielded an &quot;ad hoc&quot; militia army. Charles&#x27;s army lacked &quot;esprit de corps&quot; because of its composition by feudal lords, mercenaries, and levied gentry. The Swiss army, though poorly organized, were highly motivated, aggressive, and well-trained with their arms. The Swiss pikemen, called , repeatedly defeated and eventually killed Charles, eliminating Burgundy as a European power. Archduke Maximilian, who became co-ruler of Burgundian lands in 1477 by marrying Mary of Burgundy, was greatly influenced by the Swiss victories. When the French contested the inheritance, Maximilian levied a Flemish army and defeated the French in 1479 at the Battle of Guinegate, mixing Swiss-styled square infantry formation and Hussite wagon forts tactics. The dissolution of his levied army at war&#x27;s end found Maximilian wanting a permanent and organized military force like the Confederation&#x27;s to protect his domain. The existing Burgundian structure was inadequate to this end, however, and moreover the French wielded a monopoly on the hiring of .

Maximilian began raising the first units in 1486, amassing 6,000–8,000 mercenaries. One of these units he gave to Eitel Friedrich II, Count of Hohenzollern, who trained them with Swiss instructors in Bruges in 1487 to become the &quot;Black Guard&quot; – the first . In 1488, Maximilian organized the Swabian League, creating an army of 12,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry to deter Bavaria and Bohemia. This is considered to be the first army to be raised in Germany. Maximilian raised a strong army for the Austrian-Hungarian War of 1490, and succeeded in driving the Hungarians out of Austria. The in his army refused to serve after sacking Stuhlweissenburg (now Székesfehérvár, Hungary), citing lack of pay and stopping Maximilian&#x27;s advance on Buda. To prevent a repeat of Stuhlweissenburg, Maximilian now sought to homogenize the into a fully professional, and mostly Germanic military force.
In the 1490s, the well-trained managed to defeat significantly greater Frisian armies. wrote of the siege of Älvsborg Fortress in July 1502, fighting for the king of Denmark: &quot;We were 1800 Germans, and we were attacked by 15000 Swedish farmers ... we struck most of them dead.&quot; After the Battle of Novara in 1513, the Swiss executed the hundreds of German Landsknecht mercenaries they had captured who had fought for the French. At the Battle of Bicocca and the Battle of Marignano (1515), the performed well, defeating the famed .
The Imperial were instrumental in many of the Emperor&#x27;s victories, including the decisive Battle of Pavia in 1525. The same year, they also managed to defeat the peasants&#x27; revolt in the Empire. At their peak in the early 16th century, the were considered formidable soldiers who were often brave and loyal. However, these qualities may have declined afterward. The were also employed by the Habsburg emperor and the royal Valencian authorities in the suppression of the First Revolt of Espadà of 1526, which took place in the mountains of Espadà, in modern-day Spanish Castelló province (then in the Aragonese Kingdom of Valencia), where thousands of Valencian Muslim &quot;fellah&quot;s took up arms against the decree of forced conversion issued that very year by the emperor.

They are attested as deployed in the armies of Kings John III of Navarre and successor Henry II of Navarre during their campaigns to reconquer Navarre (1512–1524). In the same context, they are also found fighting on Charles V&#x27;s side (battle for Hondarribia, 1521–1524) where they performed strongly. They also served in high numbers in the Imperial army during the campaigns of Austria (1532), France (1542), Germanic Reformed League (1547) and in of all the Italian wars. Others also fought on the Habsburg-Ottoman frontier.

The army of the Holy Roman Emperor defeated the French army in Italy, but funds were not available to pay the soldiers. The 34,000 Imperial troops mutinied and forced their commander, Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, to lead them towards Rome. The Sack of Rome in 1527 was executed by some 6,000 Spaniards under the Duke, 14,000 under Georg von Frundsberg, some Italian infantry and some cavalry.

Terence McIntosh comments that the expansionist, aggressive policy pursued by Maximilian I and Charles V at the inception of the early modern German nation (although not to further the aims specific to the German nation per se), mainly relying on German manpower as well as utilizing fearsome &quot;Landsknecht&quot; and other mercenaries (with the Battle of Pavia and atrocities like the Sack of Rome being associated with them), would affect the way neighbours viewed the German polity, although in the longue durée, Germany tended to be at peace.

From the 1560s on, after the death of Frundsberg, the reputation of the steadily decreased. In the French Wars of Religion and the Eighty Years War, their bravery and discipline came under criticism, and the Spanish elements of the army of Flanders regularly deprecated the battlefield usefulness of the , somewhat unfairly. Their status also suffered from the rising reputation of the dreaded Spanish tercios who, however, were far less abundant and more expensive to train. When serving in southern Europe, were still considered elite troops. In the army of the Dutch rebels, many German mercenaries were hired but were forced to give up some traditions in order to increase their discipline in river crossing and their naval fighting abilities. Increasing ill-discipline within the ranks saw them replaced with an improved system of raising a German army, the &quot;Kaiserlicher Fussknecht&quot;, which was far less reliant on mercenaries.

==Organization and recruitment==
The &quot;Landsknechte&quot;, often recruited from South Germany, came from a society with exploding population growth, increasing unemployment, diverse cultural factors and depleting hierarchical structure (unlike the tightly organized society of the Swiss). In addition to dispossessed craftmen and peasants, there were burghers, aristocrats and runaway serfs as well. They were also used to freedom of carrying weapons. The result was that soldiers leaned towards a libertine (and also brutal) lifestyle. Thus, the role of the regiment, leadership by example (commanders tended to dismount to fight with the troops) and harsh discipline (involving capital punishment) were emphasized to compensate.

As with the , a regiment (a typical &quot;Landsknecht&quot; regiment consisted of 4,000 men) of was raised by a lord with a letter patent (&quot;Bestallungsbrief&quot;) that named the unit colonel (&quot;Obrist&quot;). This document laid out the size and structure of the unit, the pay of its men, and contained its Articles of War (&quot;Artikelsbriefe&quot;). Upon accepting the commission and securing funding, either through a bank loan or a grant from the lord, the colonel assembled his chain of command. His captains, once appointed, would then go to a locality he knew with drummers and fifers. Recruits gathered at a specified place and time for the muster. There, they would parade under an arch and be inspected by the colonel and his captains, then be paid their first months&#x27; salary. The colonel next read the &quot;Bestallungsbrief&quot; in full to the soldiers, who then swore oaths of allegiance to cause, officers, and the Emperor. This ceremony also saw the appointing of the unit staff and its standard bearers, or &quot;Fähnriche&quot; (ensigns), who swore to never lose the standard.

The colonel was the highest–ranking officer in a regiment, but if his force contained more than one regiment he could become a &quot;Generalobrist&quot;. If it contained cavalry and artillery in addition to its infantry, then he could be a &quot;Feldobrist&quot; or &quot;Generalfeldobrist&quot;. The regiment would be commanded by a lieutenant colonel in the colonel&#x27;s stead. The regiment itself was formed by ten &quot;Fähnlein&quot;, equivalent to a company and commanded by a captain. A &quot;Fähnlein&quot; was made up by 400 men, including 100 veterans. &quot;Rotten&quot;, equivalent to a platoon, were the building blocks of the &quot;Fähnlein&quot; and contained either ten ordinary or six &quot;Doppelsöldner&quot;, led by a &quot;Rottmeister&quot; elected by his unit. In totality, the regiment averaged 4,000 men; ten &quot;Fähnlein&quot;, containing 40 &quot;Rotten&quot;. Unit sergeant majors, called &quot;Feldweibel&quot;, were tasked with training drill and formation. The regimental sergeant major, &quot;Oberster-Feldweibel&quot; was responsible for drill on the battlefield. &quot;Rotten&quot; sergeants, &quot;Weibel&quot;, were charged with ensuring discipline and relaying liaisons between enlisted men and their officers. One of these men, the &quot;Gemeinweibel&quot;, was the spokesman for the men and was elected monthly.

According to Imperial law, a colonel could have a staff of 22 officers but in practice this depended on the colonel&#x27;s wealth. Included in that staff were a chaplain, a scribe, a doctor, a scout, his personal quartermaster and ensign, a drummer and fifer, and a bodyguard (&quot;Trabanten&quot;) of eight men. Captains also had a staff that included much of the same, but with additional musicians and two &quot;Doppelsöldner&quot; to protect him. A provost marshal and &quot;Schultheiss&quot; were appointed by the colonel to maintain military discipline and to prosecute the &quot;Artikelsbriefe&quot; respectively. The provost was unimpeachable, and feared. Harsh punishments could be expected for offenses such as mutiny or drunkenness on duty. A provost had a retinue of a jailer, bailiff, and executioner (&quot;Freimann&quot;).

===Equipment===
Just like the , formations consisted of men trained and armed with pikes, halberds, and swords. 300 men of a &quot;Fähnlein&quot; would be armed with a pike, though a &#x27;s pike was generally shorter than a &#x27;s at about . Experienced and well-equipped soldiers, receiving double a normal &#x27;s pay and getting the title &quot;Doppelsöldner&quot;, made up a quarter of each &quot;Fähnlein&quot;. 50 of these men were armed with a halberd or with a two-handed sword called a &quot;Zweihänder&quot; while another fifty were arquebusiers or crossbowmen. The focus on firearms, rather than crossbows, as ordained by Maximilian, was where they were different from the Swiss. Maximilian abolished the crossbow in military use in 1517 (although other countries continued to use them).
Most , regardless of primary weapon, carried a short sword called a &quot;Katzbalger&quot; for close combat. By the end of the 16th century, however, the number of pikemen in a &quot;Fähnlein&quot; had diminished to around 200.

===Tactics===

They also copied the Swiss in tactics. fought in a pike square they called the &quot;gevierte Ordnung&quot;, forty to sixty men deep. &quot;Doppelsöldnern&quot; made up the formation&#x27;s first two ranks. Then came the ensigns, and then the squares themselves. Pikemen, supported by halberdiers, formed the square while swordsmen made up their front and rear. The most experienced soldiers were located at the back of the formation and arquebusiers were placed on its flanks. In the attack, a band of soldiers called a forlorn hope preceded the pike square to break enemy pikes.

The pikemen were supported by halberdiers, who would rush a gap in an opposing line, a tactic also copied from the Swiss. As their solidarity grew, commanders emphasized finesse and timing, rather than the head-down battering charge of the Swiss.

As the &quot;Landsknechte&#x27;s&quot; fighting techniques were developed, they no longer preferred fighting along a straight line (as exercised by even the Swiss until the end of the fifteenth century), but leaned towards a circle-wise movement that enhanced the use of the space around the combatant and allowed them to attack the opponents from different angles. The circle-wise formation described by Jean Molinet as the &quot;snail&quot; would become the hallmark of &quot;Landsknechte&#x27;s&quot; combat. The new types of combat also required the maintenance of a stable bodily equilibrium. Maximilian, an innovator of these types of movements, also saw value in their effects over the maintenance of group discipline (apart from the control of centralised institutions). As Maximilian and his commanders sought to popularize these forms of movements (which only became daily practice at the end of the fifteenth century and gained dominance after Maximilian&#x27;s death in 1519), he promoted them in tournaments, in fencing and in dancing as well. The courtly festivals became a playground for innovations, foreshadowing developments in military practices.

==Camp==
The &quot;Tross&quot; were the camp followers or baggage train who travelled with each unit, carrying military necessities, the food, and the belongings of each soldier and his family. The &quot;Tross&quot; was made up of women, children and some craftsmen. Women and young boys set up camps, cooked, mended injuries, and dug and cleaned latrines. A was usually forbidden by his &quot;Bestallungsbrief&quot; from having more than one woman in the baggage train. The &quot;Tross&quot; was overseen by a &quot;whore&#x27;s sergeant&quot; (&quot;Hurenweibel&quot;).

<text>MacCentral was a web site that provided news and information covering the Apple Macintosh, originally as an independent entity and later as the news service for Mac Publishing Web sites, including Macworld.com and Playlist, before being subsumed by Macworld&#x27;s own brand.
MacCentral was founded by Canadian businessman Stan Flack and Jim Dalrymple as Associate Editor in 1994. In 1998, MacCentral Online acquired MacGaming. MacCentral Online was purchased by Mac Publishing in 1999. In March 2001, Macworld folded the trade-focused MacWEEK into MacCentral MacCentral was folded into the &quot;Macworld&quot; brand over a period of several years.

In June 2008 it was announced on the MacMinute news site that MacTech&#x27;s Community News Scan and Macsimum News will act as caretakers to the archives of MacMinute News and Forums which is where most of Stan&#x27;s faithful went upon the demise of MacCentral forums. They also announced they would continue to host the MacMinute Forum. Stan&#x27;s Lounge is crowded with MacCentral and MacMinute faithful in honor of Stan Flack and all that he did for the Macintosh community.

On December 10, 2008 Jim Dalrymple announced that the name MacCentral lives on; with permission from MacWorld, the old MacCentral Forums were opened at www.maccentralforums.com, where eight years of MacCentral forum history could researched. the database of the MacCentral forums has ceased to exist, abbreviated format at archive.gov.

<text>Outhwaite Homes is a public development under jurisdiction of the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority in Cleveland, Ohio. Built in 1935 by architects Edward J. Maier, Travis G. Walsh, and Leo J. Barrett and possibly named after Joseph H. Outhwaite, it was the first federally funded public housing in the Cleveland area and one of the first in the U.S. At the time of its opening, rent was listed at $4.78. The 100-plus-unit complex at East 55th Street and Woodland Avenue is, in autumn of 2011, in the final stages of redevelopment. The Outhwaite Homes, like other housing developments in the CMHA, provides residential housing for low-income families in the eastern section of downtown Cleveland.

==History==
Two famous Cleveland brothers, Louis Stokes (US Congressman for over 28 years) and Carl Stokes (first black mayor of a major US city 1967) were among the first residents of Outhwaite.

Louis Stokes Museum
On September 13, 2007, CMHA opened the Louis Stokes Museum in honor of Cleveland-native Louis Stokes, a former congressman and civil rights attorney. The Louis Stokes Museum, located at CMHA&#x27;s Outhwaite Homes, displays Stokes memorabilia, video interviews and footage, awards, and a written history about Congressman Louis Stokes and his rise to prominence. Louis and his brother Carl, Cleveland&#x27;s first black mayor, grew up in the estates. The museum is located at 2453 East 43rd Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44104.

Judge Sara J. Harper Children&#x27;s Library
Judge Sara J. Harper founded the Sara J. Harper Children&#x27;s Library in 1992 at CMHA&#x27;s Outhwaite Homes on East 43rd Street. Judge Harper grew up in the estates along with Carl and Louis Stokes. She is the first black woman graduate of the Case Western Reserve University Law School; the first woman to serve on the judiciary of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve; one of the first two women to win a seat on the Ohio Court of Appeals; and the first black woman to sit by assignment on the Ohio Supreme Court. The mission of the library is to provide a safe environment that encourages and promotes reading, learning, and positive avenues for self-realization. It is located at 2453 East 43rd Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44104.

<doc id="285434" wikidata="Q223079" url="?curid=285434" title="Quirinal Palace">
<text>The Quirinal Palace ( ) is a historic building in Rome, Italy, the main official residence of the President of the Italian Republic, together with Villa Rosebery in Naples and the Tenuta di Castelporziano, an estate on the outskirts of Rome, some from the centre of the city. It is located on the Quirinal Hill, the highest of the seven hills of Rome in an area colloquially called Monte Cavallo. It has served as the residence for thirty popes, four kings of Italy and twelve presidents of the Italian Republic.

The Quirinal Palace was selected by Napoleon to be his residence &quot;par excellence&quot; as emperor. However, he never stayed there because of the French defeat in 1814 and the subsequent European Restoration.

The palace extends for an area of 110,500 square meters and is the eleventh-largest palace in the world.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The current site of the palace has been in use since ancient Roman times, as excavations in the gardens testify. On this hill, the Romans built temples for several deities, from Flora to Quirinus, after whom the hill was named. During the reign of Constantine the Great, the last complex of Roman baths was built here, as the statues of the twins Castor and Pollux taming the horses decorating the fountain in the square testify. The Quirinal, being the highest hill in Rome, was much sought after and became a popular location for the Roman patricians, who built luxurious villas there. An example is the remains of a villa in the Quirinal gardens, where a mosaic, part of the old floor has been found.

=== Foundation of the current palace ===
The palace, located on the &quot;Via del Quirinale&quot; and facing onto the &quot;Piazza del Quirinale&quot;, was built in 1583 by Pope Gregory XIII as a papal summer residence. The Pope, who wanted to find a location which was far away from the humidity and stench coming from the River Tiber and likewise the unhealthy conditions of the Lateran Palace, chose the Quirinal hill as it was one of the most suitable places in Rome. On the site, there was already a small villa owned by the Carafa family and rented to Luigi d&#x27;Este. The Pope commissioned the architect Ottaviano Mascherino to build a palace with porticoed parallel wings and an internal courtyard by incorporating the Carafa villa, the original nucleus of the palace, later known as the Gregorian building. That project was not fully completed due to the Pope&#x27;s death in 1585. However, it is still recognisable in the north part of the courtyard, especially in the double loggia facade, topped by the panoramic Torre dei Venti (tower of the winds) or Torrino. To the latter, a bell tower was added according to a project by Carlo Maderno and Francesco Borromini.

===From the 17th century===
Pope Paul V (r. 1605–1621) commissioned the completion of the work on the main building of the palace.

The palace was also used as the location for papal conclaves in 1823, 1829, 1831, and 1846. It served as a papal residence and housed the central offices responsible for the civil government of the Papal States until 1870. In September 1870, what was left of the Papal States was occupied militarily and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. Some five months later, in 1871, Rome became the capital of the new Italian state. The palace became the official royal residence of the Kings of Italy, though some of these, notably King Victor Emmanuel III (reigned 1900–1946) actually lived in a private residence elsewhere (Villa Savoia), leaving the Quirinal to be used simply as a suite of offices and for state functions. The monarchy was abolished in 1946 and the palace became the official residence and workplace for the presidents of the Italian Republic. Still, some have declined the &quot;Colle&quot; residence and kept their usual Roman residence: for example, Sandro Pertini preferred his old flat near the Trevi Fountain.

The palace&#x27;s façade was designed by Domenico Fontana. Its Great Chapel was designed by Carlo Maderno. It contains frescos by Guido Reni, but the most famous fresco is the &quot;Blessing Christ&quot; by Melozzo da Forlì, placed over the stairs. The palace grounds include a famous set of gardens laid out in the 17th century.

==Architecture==
===Palace===



The palace is composed of the main building, which is built around the majestic courtyard, with the most beautiful halls and rooms of the complex environments that serve as representative of the Presidency of the Republic, while the offices and apartments of the head of state are housed in the Fuga building at the end of the &quot;Manica lunga&quot;, the long building on the side of Quirinal street (&quot;via del Quirinale&quot; in Italian). On the &quot;piano nobile&quot; of the &quot;Manica lunga&quot; lie the opulent imperial apartments, which were specially arranged, decorated and furnished for two visits of Kaiser Wilhelm II (in 1888 and 1893) and which now houses the monarchs or foreign heads of state visiting the president of the republic. The palace, in its totality, has 1,200 rooms.

The rooms of the palace housed in the main building are:
*The Staircase of Honour
The shape of the staircase was very useful during the papal period since the double-crossed ramp allowed to reach the two main rooms of the papal palace directly: the Throne room, today the Great hall of cuirassiers, and the Consistory room, today the Great hall of banquets, at the time used as papal private apartments.
*The Great Hall of the Cuirassiers
This was the throne room of the papal palace, where ambassadors and dignitaries were received and public audiences were held. The royal guards stood here during the Savoy period. Today, the room serves for public audiences, receptions, and solemn ceremonies held by the Presidency of the Republic.
*The Pauline Chapel
It is the largest chapel in the building, built with the same size and shape as the Sistine Chapel so that the same ceremonial could be repeated both in the Vatican and in the Quirinal. Four popes were elected here. Today the chapel hosts concerts and religious ceremonies.
*The First State Room
It is one among the rooms formerly part of the papal private apartments, today hosting informal meetings of the president of the republic on occasion.
*The Room of the Virtues
*The Room of the Flood
*The Room of the Loggias
*The Doorkeepers Room
*The Balcony Room
*The St. John Parlour
*The Yellow Room
The Yellow Room was once part of a seventy-meter long gallery built by Pope Alexander VII, later ordered split by Napoleon to serve as Empress&#x27;s private residence. It features magnificent yellow fabrics lined to the walls, hence the name of the room. In modern times, under the republic, the Napoleonic decorations were mostly removed, revealing the original ornaments.
*The Augustus Room
This room hosted the throne during the Savoy reign. 
*The Ambassadors Room
This room was used to receive dignitaries before the ceremonies, a purpose it still fulfills.
*The Hercules Room
This room is one of the latest Savoy&#x27;s interventions opened in the 1940s by dismantling rooms of the private papal apartments. The name derives from the tapestries on the walls representing the twelve labors of Hercules.
*The Cabinets Room
This room was also opened by dismantling rooms of the papal private apartment. It is a passage room; the name derives from the precious cabinets displayed here.
*The Mascarino Staircase
This extraordinary masterpiece of the architect Ottaviano Mascarino is the original staircase of the Gregorian building. The ramp winds up to aspirate to culminate in a skylight. In the Savoy era, we risked losing this masterpiece as well as all the other rooms of the Gregorian building: some princes wanted it to be destroyed to make room for a large ballroom; the project was eventually halted due to excessive expenses.
*The Loggia of Honour
*The Bees Room
*The Zodiac Room
This room was used as a dining room by the Savoy family.
*The Room of Paul V factories
*The Tapestries Room
The &quot;enfilade&quot; of the tapestries room, of the mirrors room and of the great hall of banquets was conceived in the Savoy era for the court galas which were held once a month, on the third Thursday of the month. Arriving from the staircase of honour, you first came across the great Hall of banquets, followed by the mirrors room and by the tapestries room. The tapestries room, in particular, was used as a conversation room.
*The Chapel of the Annunciation
It is the smaller chapel of the palace. In the Savoy era, it was deconsecrated and used by servants to wash dishes since it was close to the zodiac room.
*The Mirrors Room
This room was used by the Savoy as a ballroom. Here today are held audiences of the president of the republic with few participants and the oath of the Judges of the Constitutional Court.
*The Great Hall of Banquets
In the papal era, this room was used as the consistory room where the Cardinal&#x27;s College met. From the Savoy period onwards, banquets and state dinners have been held here. Today, the new government is also sworn in here.
*The Bronzino Room
Here the president of the republic meets the &quot;entourage&quot; of visiting foreign dignitaries. The name of the room derives from the tapestries on display, made on Agnolo Bronzino&#x27;s own design.
*The Druso Room 
*The president&#x27;s former audience room
*The Lilla Tapestries Toom
*The Napoleonic Parlour 
*The Piffetti Library
*The Music Room
*The War Room or Victory Room
*The Peace Room
*The Ladies Room

===Gardens===
The Quirinal Gardens, famous for the privileged position that makes them almost an &quot;island&quot; elevated above Rome, were, over the centuries, changed depending on the tastes and needs of the papal court.

The current arrangement complements the garden &quot;formal&quot; seventeenth century facing the original core of the building with the garden &quot;romantic&quot; in the second half of the eighteenth century, preserving at that time the elegant Coffee House built by Ferdinando Fuga as reception room of Benedict XIV Lambertini, decorated by paintings of Pompeo Batoni and Giovanni Paolo Pannini.

Within the Quirinal gardens lies the famous water organ built between 1997 and 1999 by Barthélemy Formentelli based on the characteristics of the previous nineteenth-century organ. The organ is fed by a waterfall with a jump of 18 meters and has a single keyboard of 41 notes with a first short octave, without pedalboard.

Overall, the Quirinal gardens extend over 4 hectares (10 acres).

By means of a trap door located in the gardens, entry can be gained to the archaeological excavations that have unearthed the remains of the original temple to the god Quirinus and some insulae of the imperial age.

<text>The gentoo penguin ( ) (Pygoscelis papua) is a penguin species (or possibly a species complex) in the genus &quot;Pygoscelis&quot;, most closely related to the Adélie penguin (&quot;P. adeliae&quot;) and the chinstrap penguin (&quot;P. antarcticus&quot;). The earliest scientific description was made in 1781 by Johann Reinhold Forster with a type locality in the Falkland Islands. The species calls in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting, which the bird emits with its head thrown back.

==Names==
The application of &quot;gentoo&quot; to the penguin is unclear. &quot;Gentoo&quot; was an Anglo-Indian term to distinguish Hindus from Muslims. The English term may have originated from the Portuguese &quot;gentio&quot; (&quot;pagan, gentile&quot;). Some speculate that the white patch on the bird&#x27;s head was thought to resemble a turban.

It may also be a variation of another name for this bird, &quot;Johnny penguin&quot;, with Johnny being the Spanish counterpart of and sounding vaguely like gentoo. The Johnny rook, a predator, is likely named after the Johnny penguin.

The specific name &quot;papua&quot; is a misnomer; in the original description, Johann Reinhold Forster, a naturalist who had circumnavigated the world with Captain James Cook, mistakenly assumed that the species occurred in Papua (New Guinea), the closest gentoos being over 6000 km to the south (on Macquarie Island). No penguins are found in New Guinea. Others trace the error to a &quot;possibly fraudulent claim&quot; in 1776 by French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat, who also alleged a Papuan location for the king penguin despite never having been to the island himself.

==Taxonomy==
The gentoo penguin is one of three species in the genus &quot;Pygoscelis&quot;. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago (Mya), about 2 million years after the ancestors of the genus &quot;Aptenodytes&quot;. In turn, the Adélie penguins split off from the other members of the genus around 19 Mya and the chinstrap and gentoo finally diverged around 14 Mya.

There are 4 subspecies recognized by the International Ornithological Congress:
Although the population on the Kerguelen Islands is tentatively included in &quot;taeniata&quot;, it may also be a distinct subspecies.

Before 2021, only two subspecies of the gentoo penguin have been recognised: &quot;P. p. papua&quot; (subantarctic gentoo) and the smaller &quot;P. p. ellsworthi&quot; (Antarctic gentoo). However, a 2020 study suggested that the gentoo penguin be split into a species complex of four morphologically similar but separate species: the northern gentoo penguin (&quot;P. papua sensu stricto&quot;), the southern gentoo penguin (&quot;P. ellsworthi&quot;), the eastern gentoo penguin (&quot;P. taeniata&quot;) and the newly described South Georgia gentoo penguin (&quot;P. poncetii&quot;). The International Ornithological Congress incorporated the results of this study in 2021, but relegated the newly recognized or newly described species to being subspecies of &quot;P. papua&quot;.

==Description==
The gentoo penguin is easily recognised by the wide, white stripe extending like a bonnet across the top of its head and its bright orange-red bill. It has pale whitish-pink, webbed feet and a fairly long tail – the most prominent tail of all penguin species. Chicks have grey backs with white fronts. As the gentoo penguin waddles along on land, its tail sticks out behind, sweeping from side to side, hence the scientific name &quot;Pygoscelis&quot;, which means &quot;rump-tailed&quot;.
Gentoo penguins can reach a length of , making them the third-largest species of penguin after the emperor penguin and the king penguin. Males have a maximum weight around just before moulting and a minimum weight of about just before mating. For females, the maximum weight is just before moulting, but their weight drops to as little as when guarding the chicks in the nest. Birds from the north are on average heavier and longer than the southern birds. Southern gentoo penguins reach in length. They are the fastest underwater swimmers of all penguins, reaching speeds up to . Gentoos are well adapted to extremely cold and harsh climates.

==Breeding==

The breeding colonies of gentoo penguins are located on ice-free surfaces. Settlements can be located directly on the shoreline or considerably inland. They prefer shallow coastal areas and often nest between tufts of grass. In South Georgia, for example, breeding colonies are 2 km inland. In colonies farther inland, where the penguins nest in grassy areas, they shift location slightly yearly because the grass becomes trampled over time.

Gentoos breed on many subantarctic islands. The main colonies are on the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and Kerguelen Islands; smaller colonies are found on: Macquarie Island, Heard Islands, Crozet Islands, South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. The total breeding population is estimated to be over 600,000 birds. Nests are usually made from a roughly circular pile of stones and can be quite large, high and in diameter. The stones are jealously guarded, and their ownership can be the subject of noisy disputes and physical attacks between individuals. They are also prized by the females, even to the point that a male penguin can obtain the favours of a female by offering her a choice stone.

Two eggs are laid, both weighing around . The parents share incubation, changing duty daily. The eggs hatch after 34 to 36 days. The chicks remain in the nests for around 30 days before joining other chicks in the colony and forming &quot;crèches&quot;. The chicks moult into subadult plumage and go out to sea at around 80 to 100 days.

==Diet==
Gentoos mainly live on fish, crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. In February and March, crustaceans make up about 10% of the diet, but from March to June, it is about 75%. From June to October, grey rockcod (Lepidonotothen squamifrons) make up 90% of their diet. Cephalopods make up only 10% of the diet throughout the year.

Gentoos are opportunistic feeders, and around the Falklands are known to take roughly equal proportions of fish (&quot;Patagonotothen&quot; sp., &quot;Thysanopsetta naresi&quot;, &quot;Micromesistius australis&quot;), squat lobsters (&quot;Munida gregaria&quot;) and squid (&quot;Loligo gahi&quot;, &quot;Gonatus antarcticus&quot;, &quot;Moroteuthis ingens&quot;). Other prey include &quot;Channichthys rhinoceratus&quot; and octopuses.

==Physiology==
 The gentoos&#x27; diet is high in salt, as they eat organisms with relatively the same salinity as seawater, which can lead to complications associated with high sodium concentrations in the body, especially for gentoo chicks. To counteract this, gentoos, as well as many other marine bird species, have a highly developed salt gland located above their eyes that takes the high concentration of sodium within the body and produces a highly saline-concentrated solution that drips out of the body from the tip of the beak.

Gentoo penguins do not store as much fat as Adélie penguins, their closest relative; gentoos require less energy investment when hunting because the net gain of energy after hunting is greater in gentoos than Adélies. As embryos, gentoos require a lot of energy to develop. Oxygen consumption is high for a developing gentoo embryo. As the embryo grows and requires more oxygen, consumption increases exponentially until the gentoo chick hatches. By then, the chick is consuming around 1800 ml O2 per day.

==Predators==
In the sea, leopard seals, sea lions and killer whales are all predators of the gentoo. On land, no predators of full-grown, healthy gentoo penguins exist. Skuas and giant petrels regularly kill many chicks and steal eggs; petrels kill injured and sick adult gentoos. Various other seabirds, such as the kelp gull and snowy sheathbill, also snatch chicks and eggs. Skuas on King George Island have been observed attacking and injuring adult gentoo penguins in apparent territorial disputes.

==Conservation status==
The population of &quot;Pygoscelis papua&quot; in the maritime Antarctic is rapidly increasing. Due to regional climate changes, they colonise previously inaccessible territories southwards., the IUCN Red List lists the gentoo as least concerned with a stable population trend, although rapid declines in some key areas are believed to be driving a moderate overall decline in the species population. Examples include Bird Island, South Georgia, where the population has fallen by two-thirds over 25 years. Many threats to this species, including pollution, hunting, fishing and human recreational activities continue to affect them.

== In popular culture ==
The Linux distribution Gentoo Linux is named after the gentoo penguin. This is a nod to the fact that the penguin is the fastest swimming penguin, as Gentoo Linux aims to be a high-performance operating system. The mascot for Linux in general is a penguin.

<text>The Canada Act 1982 (1982 c. 11; ) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and one of the enactments which make up the Constitution of Canada. It was enacted at the request of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada to patriate Canada&#x27;s constitution, ending the power of the British Parliament to amend the constitution. The act also formally ended the &quot;request and consent&quot; provisions of the Statute of Westminster 1931 in relation to Canada, whereby the British parliament had a general power to pass laws extending to Canada at its own request.

Annexed as Schedule B to the act is the text of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, in both of Canada&#x27;s official languages (i.e. English and French). Because of the requirements of official bilingualism, the body of the &quot;Canada Act&quot; itself is also set out in French in Schedule A to the act, which is declared by s. 3 to have &quot;the same authority in Canada as the English version thereof&quot;.

==History==

Canada&#x27;s modern political history as a union of previously separate provinces began with the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; (officially called the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867,&quot; in Canada). This act combined the Province of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec) with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a Dominion within the British Empire. Canada adopted a Westminster-style government with a Parliament of Canada. A governor general fulfilled the constitutional duties of the British sovereign on Canadian soil. Similar arrangements applied within each province.

Despite this autonomy, the United Kingdom still had the power to legislate for Canada, and Canada was thus still legally a self-governing British dominion. The Statute of Westminster 1931 restricted the British Parliament&#x27;s power to legislate for Canada, unless the Dominion requested and consented to Imperial legislation. This had the effect of increasing Canada&#x27;s sovereignty. The British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949, was also passed by the British Parliament, giving the Parliament of Canada significant constitutional amending powers.

However, with Canada&#x27;s agreement at the time, under s. 7(1) of the Statute of Westminster, the British Parliament also retained the power to amend the key Canadian constitutional statutes, namely the British North America Acts. In effect, an act of the &quot;British&quot; Parliament was required to make certain changes to the Canadian constitution. Delay in the patriation of the Canadian constitution was due in large part to the lack of agreement concerning a method for amending the constitution that would be acceptable to all of the provinces, particularly Quebec.

==Enactment==

The &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in response to the request from the Canadian Senate and House of Commons to end Britain&#x27;s authority and transfer the authority for amending the Constitution of Canada to the federal and provincial governments. After unpromising negotiations with the provincial governments, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced that the federal government would unilaterally patriate the Constitution from Britain. Manitoba, Newfoundland and Quebec responded by posing references to the provincial courts of appeal, challenging the federal government&#x27;s power to seek unilateral amendments from Britain. In September 1981, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the &quot;Patriation Reference&quot; that provincial consent was not legally necessary, but to do so without substantial consent would be contrary to a longstanding constitutional convention. Trudeau succeeded in convincing nine provinces out of ten to consent to patriation by agreeing to the addition of a Notwithstanding Clause to limit the application of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; as a result of discussions during a First Ministers&#x27; conference and other minor changes in November 1981.

There was little opposition from the British government to passing the act, with 44 members of Parliament (MPs) voting against the act, less than 10 percent of the House of Commons. Citing concerns over Canada&#x27;s past mistreatment of Quebec and Indigenous peoples (as recalled with frustration by Jean Chrétien in his memoirs &quot;Straight from the Heart&quot;), 24 Conservative and 16 Labour MPs voted against the act. However, new research into documents of the Margaret Thatcher government indicate that Britain had serious concerns about the inclusion of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; within the &quot;Canada Act&quot;. Part of this concern stemmed from letters of protest the British received about it from provincial actors, but also because the Charter undermined the principle of parliamentary supremacy, which until that time had always been a core feature of every government practising the Westminster system.

Through section 2 of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;, the United Kingdom ended its involvement with further amendments to the Canadian constitution. Amendments to the Constitution now must be made under the various amending formulas set out in Part V of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

==Proclamation==

The &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; received royal assent on March 29 in London, but it did not take full effect immediately. Canada&#x27;s &quot;Constitution Act, 1982,&quot; was proclaimed in force by Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada on April 17 on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. The proclamation marked the end of a long process and efforts by many successive governments to patriate the Constitution. The proclamation brought into force the new amending formula, ending any role for the British Parliament in Canadian law, and implemented the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

The monarch&#x27;s constitutional powers and roles over Canada were not affected by the act. Canada has complete sovereignty as an independent country, however, and the King&#x27;s role as monarch of Canada is separate from his role as the British monarch or the monarch of any of the other Commonwealth realms. Canada, like other Commonwealth realms, retains the King as head of state.

<doc id="285438" wikidata="Q170076" url="?curid=285438" title="Jean Dubuffet">
<text>Jean Philippe Arthur Dubuffet (; 31 July 1901 – 12 May 1985) was a French painter and sculptor of the Ecole de Paris (School of Paris). His idealistic approach to aesthetics embraced so-called &quot;low art&quot; and eschewed traditional standards of beauty in favor of what he believed to be a more authentic and humanistic approach to image-making. He is perhaps best known for founding the art movement art brut, and for the collection of works—&quot;Collection de l&#x27;art brut&quot;—that this movement spawned. Dubuffet enjoyed a prolific art career, both in France and in America, and was featured in many exhibitions throughout his lifetime.

==Early life==
Dubuffet was born in Le Havre to a family of wholesale wine merchants who were part of the wealthy bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeMonde_2013/07/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood friends included the writers Raymond Queneau and Georges Limbour. He moved to Paris in 1918 to study painting at the Académie Julian, becoming close friends with the artists Juan Gris, André Masson, and Fernand Léger. Six months later, upon finding academic training to be distasteful, he left the Académie to study independently. During this time, Dubuffet developed many other interests, including free noise music, poetry, and the study of ancient and modern languages. Dubuffet also traveled to Italy and Brazil, and upon returning to Le Havre in 1925, he married for the first time and went on to start a small wine business in Paris. He took up painting again in 1934 when he made a large series of portraits in which he emphasized the vogues in art history. But again he stopped, developing his wine business at Bercy during the German Occupation of France. Years later, in an autobiographical text, he boasted about having made substantial profits by supplying wine to the Wehrmacht.

==Early work==

In 1942, Dubuffet decided to devote himself again to art. He often chose subjects for his works from everyday life, such as people sitting in the Paris Métro or walking in the country. Dubuffet painted with strong, unbroken colors, recalling the palette of Fauvism, as well as the Brucke painters, with their juxtaposing and discordant patches of color. Many of his works featured an individual or individuals placed in a very cramped space, which had a distinct psychological impact on viewers. In 1943, the writer George Limbour, a friend of Dubuffet from childhood, took Jean Paulhan to the artist&#x27;s studio. Dubuffet&#x27;s work at that time was unknown. Paulhan was impressed and the meeting proved to be a turning point for Dubuffet. His first solo show came in October 1944, at the Galerie Rene Drouin in Paris. This marked Dubuffet&#x27;s third attempt to become an established artist.

In 1945, Dubuffet attended and was strongly impressed by a show in Paris of Jean Fautrier&#x27;s paintings in which he recognized meaningful art which expressed directly and purely the depth of a person. Emulating Fautrier, Dubuffet started to use thick oil paint mixed with materials such as mud, sand, coal dust, pebbles, pieces of glass, string, straw, plaster, gravel, cement, and tar. This allowed him to abandon the traditional method of applying oil paint to canvas with a brush; instead, Dubuffet created a paste into which he could create physical marks, such as scratches and slash marks. The impasto technique of mixing and applying paint was best manifested in Dubuffet&#x27;s series &#x27;Hautes Pâtes&#x27; or Thick Impastoes, which he exhibited at his second major exhibition, entitled &quot;Microbolus Macadam &amp; Cie/Hautes Pates&quot; in 1946 at the Galérie René Drouin. His use of crude materials and the irony that he infused into many of his works incited a significant amount of backlash from critics, who accused Dubuffet of &#x27;anarchy&#x27; and &#x27;scraping the dustbin&#x27;. He did receive some positive feedback as well—Clement Greenberg took notice of Dubuffet&#x27;s work and wrote that &#x27;[f]rom a distance, Dubuffet seems the most original painter to have come out of the School of Paris since Miro...&#x27; Greenberg went on to say that &#x27;Dubuffet is perhaps the one new painter of real importance to have appeared on the scene in Paris in the last decade.&#x27; Indeed, Dubuffet was very prolific in the United States in the year following his first exhibition in New York (1951).

After 1946, Dubuffet started a series of portraits, with his own friends Henri Michaux, Francis Ponge, George Limbour, Jean Paulhan and Pierre Matisse serving as &#x27;models&#x27;. He painted these portraits in the same thick materials, and in a manner deliberately anti-psychological and anti-personal, as Dubuffet expressed himself. A few years later he approached the surrealist group in 1948, then the College of Pataphysique in 1954. He was friendly with the French playwright, actor and theater director Antonin Artaud, he admired and supported the writer Louis-Ferdinand Céline and was strongly connected with the artistic circle around the surrealist André Masson. In 1944 he started an important relationship with the resistance-fighter and French writer and publisher Jean Paulhan who was also strongly fighting against &quot;intellectual terrorism&quot;, as he called it.

==Reception in America==

Dubuffet achieved very rapid success in the American art market, largely due to his inclusion in the Pierre Matisse exhibition in 1946. His association with Matisse proved to be very beneficial. Matisse was a very influential dealer of contemporary European Art in America, and was known for strongly supporting the School of Paris artists. Dubuffet&#x27;s work was placed among the likes of Picasso, Braque, and Rouault at the gallery exhibit, and he was one of only two young artists to be honored in this manner. A Newsweek article dubbed Dubuffet the &#x27;darling of Parisian avant-garde circles,&#x27; and Greenberg wrote positively about Dubuffet&#x27;s three canvases in a review of the exhibit. In 1947 Dubuffet had his first solo exhibition in America, in the same gallery as the Matisse exhibition. Reviews were largely favorable, and this resulted in Dubuffet having at least an annual, if not a biannual exhibition at that gallery.

Due to his participation in a steady stream of art exhibitions within his first few years in New York, Dubuffet became a constant presence in the American art world. Dubuffet&#x27;s association with the School of Paris provided him with a unique vehicle to reach American audiences, even though he dissociated himself from most of the ideals of the school, and reacted very strongly against the &#x27;great traditions of painting.&#x27; Americans were intrigued by Dubuffet&#x27;s simultaneous roots in the established French vanguard and his work, which was such a strong reaction against his background. Many painters of the New York school at this time were also trying to seek status within the avant-garde tradition, and drew influence from Dubuffet&#x27;s work. His reception in America was very closely linked to and dependent upon the New York art world&#x27;s desire to create its own avant-garde environment.

Specific examples of American artists interested in Dubuffet’s art were Alfonso Ossorio and Joseph Glasco. At the end of 1949, while Pierre Matisse was preparing Dubuffet’s January 1950 show, Alfonso Ossorio had traveled to Paris to meet Dubuffet and buy some of his paintings. Then in 1950, at Ossorio’s urging, his young friend Joseph Glasco left New York for Paris to meet Dubuffet. Glasco credited this encounter as having had an influence on his own art, and Dubuffet frequently asked about “Pollock and Glasco” in his letters to Ossorio.

==Transition to art brut==
Between 1947 and 1949, Dubuffet took three separate trips to Algeria—a French colony at the time—in order to find further artistic inspiration. In this sense, Dubuffet is very similar to other artists such as Delacroix, Matisse, and Fromentin. However, the art that Dubuffet produced while he was there was very specific insofar as it recalled Post-War French ethnography in light of decolonization. Dubuffet was fascinated by the nomadic nature of the tribes in Algeria—he admired the ephemeral quality of their existence, in that they did not stay in any one particular area for long, and were constantly shifting. The impermanence of this kind of movement attracted Dubuffet and became a facet of art brut. In June 1948, Dubuffet, along with Jean Paulhan, Andre Breton, Charles Ratton, Michel Tapie, and Henri-Pierre Roche, officially established &quot;La Compagnie de l&#x27;art brut&quot; in Paris. This association was dedicated to the discovery, documentation and exhibition of art brut. Dubuffet later amassed his own collection of such art, including artists Aloïse Corbaz and Adolf Wölfli. This collection is now housed at the Collection de l&#x27;art brut in Lausanne, Switzerland. His art brut collection is often referred to as a &quot;museum without walls&quot;, as it transcended national and ethnic boundaries, and effectively broke down barriers between nationalities and cultures.

Influenced by Hans Prinzhorn&#x27;s book &quot;Artistry of the Mentally Ill&quot;, Dubuffet coined the term &quot;art brut&quot; (meaning &quot;raw art&quot;, often referred to as &#x27;outsider art&#x27;) for art produced by non-professionals working outside aesthetic norms, such as art by psychiatric patients, prisoners, and children. Dubuffet felt that the simple life of the everyday human being contained more art and poetry than did academic art, or great painting. He found the latter to be isolating, mundane, and pretentious, and wrote in his &quot;Prospectus aux amateurs de tout genre&quot; that his aim was &#x27;not the mere gratification of a handful of specialists, but rather the man in the street when he comes home from work...it is the man in the street whom I feel closest to, with whom I want to make friends and enter into confidence, and &quot;he&quot; is the one I want to please and enchant by means of my work.&#x27; To that end, Dubuffet began to search for an art form in which everyone could participate and by which everyone could be entertained. He sought to create an art as free from intellectual concerns as Art Brut, and as a result, his work often appears primitive and childlike. His form is often compared to wall scratchings and children&#x27;s art. Nonetheless, Dubuffet appeared to be quite erudite when it came to writing about his own work. According to prominent art critic Hilton Kramer, &quot;There is only one thing wrong with the essays Dubuffet has written on his own work: their dazzling intellectual finesse makes nonsense of his claim to a free and untutored primitivism. They show us a mandarin literary personality, full of chic phrases and up-to-date ideas, that is quite the opposite of the naive visionary.&quot;

==Artistic style==
Dubuffet&#x27;s art primarily features the resourceful exploitation of unorthodox materials. Many of Dubuffet&#x27;s works are painted in oil paint using an impasto thickened by materials such as sand, tar and straw, giving the work an unusually textured surface. Dubuffet was the first artist to use this type of thickened paste, called bitumen. Additionally, in his earlier paintings, Dubuffet dismissed the concept of perspective in favor of a more direct, two-dimensional presentation of space. Instead, Dubuffet created the illusion of perspective by crudely overlapping objects within the picture plane. This method most directly contributed to the cramped effect of his works.

From 1962 he produced a series of works in which he limited himself to the colours red, white, black, and blue. Towards the end of the 1960s he turned increasingly to sculpture, producing works in polystyrene which he then painted with vinyl paint.

Dubuffet has influenced Linda Naeff.

==Other enterprises==
In late 1960–1961, Dubuffet began experimenting with music and sound and made several recordings with the Danish painter Asger Jorn, a founding member of the avant-garde movement COBRA. The same period he started making sculpture, but in a very not-sculptural way. As his medium he preferred to use the ordinary materials as papier-mâché and for all the light medium polystyrene, in which he could model very fast and switch easily from one work to another, as sketches on paper. At the end of the 1960s he started to create his large sculpture-habitations, such as &#x27;Tour aux figures&#x27;, &#x27;Jardin d&#x27;Hiver&#x27; and &#x27;Villa Falbala&#x27; in which people can wander, stay, and contemplate. In 1969 ensued an acquaintance between him and the French Outsider Art artist Jacques Soisson.

In 1974 Dubuffet created &quot;Jardin d&#x27;émail&quot;, a very large outdoor painted sculpture designed for the Kröller-Müller Museum.

In 1978 Dubuffet collaborated with American composer and musician Jasun Martz to create the record album artwork for Martz&#x27;s avant-garde symphony entitled &quot;The Pillory&quot;. The much written about drawing has been reproduced internationally in three different editions on tens-of-thousands of record albums and compact discs. A detail of the drawing is also featured on Martz&#x27;s second symphony (2005), &quot;The Pillory/The Battle&quot;, performed by The Intercontinental Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Choir.

==Death==
Dubuffet died from emphysema in Paris on 12 May 1985.

<text>Edessa (; ) was an ancient city (&quot;polis&quot;) in Upper Mesopotamia, in what is now Urfa or Şanlıurfa, Turkey. It was founded during the Hellenistic period by Macedonian general and self proclaimed king Seleucus I Nicator (), founder of the Seleucid Empire. He named it after an ancient Macedonian capital. The Greek name (&quot;Édessa&quot;) means &quot;tower in the water&quot;. It later became capital of the Kingdom of Osroene, and continued as capital of the Roman province of Osroene. In Late Antiquity, it became a prominent center of Christian learning and seat of the Catechetical School of Edessa. During the Crusades, it was the capital of the County of Edessa.

The city was situated on the banks of the Daysan River (; ; ), a tributary of the Khabur, and was defended by Şanlıurfa Castle, the high central citadel.

Ancient Edessa is the predecessor of modern Urfa (; ; ; ), in Şanlıurfa Province, Turkey. Modern names of the city are likely derived from Urhay or Orhay (), the site&#x27;s Syriac name before the re-foundation of the settlement by Seleucus I Nicator. After the defeat of the Seleucids in the Seleucid–Parthian Wars, Edessa became capital of the Kingdom of Osroene, with a mixed Syriac and Hellenistic culture. The origin of the name of Osroene itself is probably related to Orhay.

The Roman Republic began exercising political influence over the Kingdom of Osroene and its capital Edessa from 69 BC. It became a Roman &quot;colonia&quot; in 212 or 213, though there continued to be local kings of Osroene until 243 or 248. In Late Antiquity, Edessa was an important city on the Roman–Persian frontier with the Sasanian Empire. It resisted the attack of Shapur I () in his third invasion of Roman territory. The 260 Battle of Edessa saw Shapur defeat the Roman emperor Valerian () and capture him alive, an unprecedented disaster for the Roman state. The Late Antique &quot;Laterculus Veronensis&quot; names Edessa as the capital of the Roman province of Osroene. The Roman soldier and Latin historian Ammianus Marcellinus described the city&#x27;s formidable fortifications and how in 359 it successfully resisted the attack of Shapur II ().

The city was a centre of Greek and Syriac theological and philosophical thought, hosting the famed School of Edessa. Edessa remained in Roman hands until its capture by the Persians during the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, an event recorded by the Greek &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; as occurring in 609. Roman control was restored by the 627 and 628 victories of Heraclius () in the Byzantine–Sasanian War, but the city was lost by the Romans again in 638, to the Rashidun Caliphate during the Muslim conquest of the Levant. It did not return to the Romans&#x27; control until the Byzantine Empire temporarily recovered the city in the mid-10th century after a number of failed attempts.

The Byzantine Empire regained control in 1031, though it did not remain under their rule long and changed hands several times before the end of the century. The County of Edessa, one of the Crusader states set up after the success of the First Crusade, was centred on the city, the crusaders having seized the city from the Seljuks. The county survived until the 1144 Siege of Edessa, in which Imad al-Din Zengi, founder of the Zengid dynasty, captured the city and, according to Matthew of Edessa, killed many of the Edessenes. The Turkic Zengid dynasty&#x27;s lands were eventually absorbed by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 after the 1514 Battle of Chaldiran.

==Names==

The earliest name of the city was &quot;Admaʾ&quot;(also written &quot;Adme&quot;, &quot;Admi&quot;, &quot;Admum&quot;; ), recorded in Assyrian cuneiform in the Old Assyrian period. It is recorded in Syriac as ܐܕܡܐ &quot;Adme.&quot;

The ancient town was refounded as a Hellenistic military settlement by Seleucus I Nicator in BC, and named &quot;Edessa&quot; after the ancient capital of Macedonia, perhaps due to its abundant water, just like its Macedonian namesake. It was later renamed &quot;Callirrhoe&quot; or &quot;Antiochia on the Callirhoe&quot; (; ) in the 2nd century BC (found on Edessan coins struck by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, r. 175–164 BC).

After Antiochus IV&#x27;s reign, the name of the city reverted to Edessa, in Greek, and also appears in Armenian as &quot;Urha&quot; or &quot;Ourha&quot; (), in Aramaic (Syriac) as &quot;Urhay&quot; or &quot;Orhay&quot; (), in local Neo-Aramaic (Turoyo) as &quot;Urhoy&quot;, in Arabic as &quot;ar-Ruhā&quot; (), in the Kurdish languages as , Latinized as &quot;Rohais&quot;, and finally adopted into Turkish as &quot;Urfa&quot; or &quot;Şanlıurfa&quot; (&quot;Glorious Urfa&quot;), its present name. This originally Aramaic and Syriac name for the city may have been derived from the Persian name &quot;Khosrow&quot;.

It was re-named &quot;Justinopolis&quot; during the Byzantine period in the early 6th century. According to some Jewish and Muslim traditions, it is the location of Ur of the Chaldees, the birthplace of Abraham.

==Geography==
Edessa was situated on a ridge in the middle of a ring of hills surrounded by a fertile plain, and was therefore considered to be favourably situated. The ridge in turn was an extension of Mount Masius, part of the Taurus Mountains of southern Asia Minor. The city was located at a crossroads; the east–west highway from Zeugma on the Euphrates to the Tigris, and the north–south route from Samosata (modern-day Samsat) to the Euphrates via Carrhae (modern-day Harran) met at the ridge where Edessa was located.

==History==

===Antiquity===

In the second half of the second century BC, as the Seleucid Empire disintegrated during wars with Parthia (145–129 BC), Edessa became the capital of the Abgarid dynasty, who founded the kingdom of Osroene (also known as Edessa). This kingdom was established by Arabs from the northern Arabian Peninsula and lasted nearly four centuries (c. 132 BC to A.D. 214), under twenty-eight rulers, who sometimes called themselves &quot;king&quot; on their coinage. Edessa was at first more or less under the protectorate of the Parthians, then of Tigranes of Armenia, Edessa was Armenian Mesopotamia&#x27;s capital city, then from the time of Pompey under the Roman Empire. Following its capture and sack by Trajan, the Romans even occupied Edessa from 116 to 118, although its sympathies towards the Parthians led to Lucius Verus pillaging the city later in the 2nd century.

Christianity is attested in Edessa in the 2nd century; the gnostic Bardaisan was a native of the city and a philosopher at its court. From 212 to 214 the kingdom was a Roman province.
The Roman emperor Caracalla was assassinated on the road from Edessa to Carrhae (now Harran) by one of his guards in 217. Edessa became one of the frontier cities of the province of Osroene and lay close to the border of the Sasanian Empire. The Battle of Edessa took place between the Roman armies under the command of the emperor Valerian and the Sasanian forces under emperor Shapur I in 260. The Roman army was defeated and captured in its entirety by the Persian forces, including Valerian himself, an event which had never previously happened.

The literary language of the tribes that had founded this kingdom was Aramaic, from which Syriac developed. Traces of Hellenistic culture were soon overwhelmed in Edessa, which employed Syriac legends on coinage, with the exception of the client king Abgar IX (179–214), and there is a corresponding lack of Greek public inscriptions.

=== Late Antiquity ===

According to the &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot;, a Syriac chronicle written after 540, the cathedral church of Edessa was founded immediately after the end of the Diocletianic Persecution and the 313 &quot;Letter of Licinius&quot;, which ended the general persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. The cathedral church was dedicated to the Holy Wisdom. Around 23 different monasteries and churches are known to have existed in the city, with at least as many again just outside town; these attracted many pilgrims. Eusebius of Caesarea even claimed in his &quot;Church History&quot; that &quot;the whole city&quot; was &quot;devoted to the name of Christ&quot; in the early 4th century; in fact the city had at least some pagan inhabitants into the early 5th century, as well as Jewish ones.

Eusebius also claimed to quote the &quot;Letter of Abgar to Jesus&quot; and the &quot;Letter of Jesus to Abgar&quot; in the state archives of Edessa, foundational texts of the Abgar Legend.

Egeria, a high-status Roman lady and author, visited Edessa in 384 on her way to Jerusalem; she saw a &quot;martyrium&quot; of Thomas the Apostle and the text of the &quot;Letter of Jesus&quot; inscribed on the city walls, said to protect the city. She saw a longer version of the &quot;Letters&quot; than she was previously familiar with, and was assured that the holy words had repelled a Persian assault on the city. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot;, in 394 the relics of Saint Thomas were translated into the great Church of St Thomas and in 442 they were encased in a silver casket. According to the late-6th-century Frankish hagiographer and bishop Gregory of Tours, the relics had themselves been brought from India, while in Edessa an annual fair (and alleviation of customs duties) was held at the church in July in the saint&#x27;s honour (the feast of St Thomas was observed on 3 July) during which, Gregory alleged, water would appear in shallow wells and flies disappeared. According to Joshua the Stylite, a shrine to some martyred saints was built outside the city walls in 346 or 347.

A more elaborate version of the Abgar Legend is recorded in the early 5th-century Syriac &quot;Doctrine of Addai&quot;, purportedly based on the state archives of Edessa, and including both a pseudepigraphal letter from Abgar V to Tiberius () and the emperor&#x27;s supposed reply. This text is the earliest to allege that a painting (or icon) of Jesus was enclosed with the reply to Abgar and that the city of Edessa was prophesied never to fall. According to this text, Edessenes were early adopters of Christianity; the inhabitants of the neighbouring city of Carrhae (Harran), by contrast, were pagans. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot;, the early 5th-century theologian and bishop Rabbula built a church dedicated to Saint Stephen in a building that had been a synagogue. The city was a site of major unrest in 449 due to an attempt to depose its bishop, Ibas.

When Nisibis (Nusaybin) was ceded to the Sasanian Empire along with Arzanene, Moxoene, Zabdicene, Rehimena and Corduene in 363, Ephrem the Syrian left his native town for Edessa, where he founded the celebrated School of Edessa. This school, largely attended by the Christian youth of Persia, and closely watched by Rabbula, the friend of Cyril of Alexandria, on account of its Nestorian tendencies, reached its highest development under bishop Ibas, famous through the Three-Chapter Controversy, was temporarily closed in 457, and finally in 489, by command of Emperor Zeno and Bishop Cyrus, when the teachers and students of the School of Edessa repaired to Nisibis and became chief writers of the Church of the East. Miaphysitism prospered at Edessa after the Arab conquest.

Under the Sassanian emperor Kavad I (), the Sasanids attacked Edessa. According to Joshua the Stylite the shrine outside the walls set up in the 340s was burnt by his troops.

Edessa was rebuilt by Justin I (), and renamed Justinopolis after him. The Greek historian Procopius, in his &quot;Persian Wars&quot;, describes the inscription of the &quot;Letter of Jesus&quot;&#x27;s text on the city gates of Edessa, which he stated made the defences impregnable.

An unsuccessful Sasanian siege occurred in 544. The city was taken in 609 by the Sasanian Empire, and retaken by Heraclius, but lost to the Muslim army under the Rashidun Caliphate during the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 638.

====Early Christian centre====
The precise date of the introduction of Christianity into Edessa is not known. However, there is no doubt that even before AD 190 Christianity had spread vigorously within Edessa and its surroundings and that shortly after the royal house joined the church.

According to a legend first reported by Eusebius in the fourth century, King Abgar V was converted by Thaddeus of Edessa (Addai), who was one of the seventy-two disciples, sent to him by &quot;Judas, who is also called Thomas&quot;. However, various sources confirm that the Abgar who embraced the Christian faith was Abgar IX. Under him Christianity became the official religion of the kingdom.

Addai was succeeded by Aggai, then by Saint Mari, who was ordained about 200 by Serapion of Antioch. Thence came to us in the second century the famous &quot;Peshitta&quot;, or Syriac translation of the Old Testament; also Tatian&#x27;s &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, which was compiled about 172 and in common use until Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa (412–435), forbade its use. Among the illustrious disciples of the School of Edessa, Bardaisan (154–222), a schoolfellow of Abgar IX, deserves special mention for his role in creating Christian religious poetry, and whose teaching was continued by his son Harmonius and his disciples.

A Christian council was held at Edessa as early as 197. In 201 the city was devastated by a great flood, and the Christian church was destroyed. In 232 the relics of the apostle Thomas were brought from Mylapore, India, on which occasion his Syriac Acts were written. Under Roman domination many martyrs suffered at Edessa: Sharbel and Barsamya, under Decius; Sts. Gûrja, Shâmôna, Habib, and others under Diocletian. In the meanwhile Christian priests from Edessa had evangelized Eastern Mesopotamia and Persia, and established the first Churches in the Sasanian Empire. Atillâtiâ, Bishop of Edessa, assisted at the First Council of Nicaea (325). The &quot;Peregrinatio Silviae&quot; (or Etheriae) gives an account of the many sanctuaries at Edessa about 388.

As metropolis of Osroene, Edessa had eleven suffragan sees. Michel Le Quien mentions thirty-five bishops of Edessa, but his list is incomplete.

The Eastern Orthodox episcopate seems to have disappeared after the 11th century. Of its Jacobite bishops, twenty-nine are mentioned by Le Quien (II, 1429 sqq.), many others in the &quot;Revue de l&#x27;Orient chrétien&quot; (VI, 195), some in &quot;Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft&quot; (1899), 261 sqq. Moreover, Nestorian bishops are said to have resided at Edessa as early as the 6th century.

==== Islamic rule ====
The Armenian chronicler Sebeos, bishop of Bagratid Armenia writing in the 660s, gives the earliest narrative accounts of Islam in any language today. Sebeos writes of a Jewish delegation going to an Arab city (possibly Medina) after the Byzantines conquered Edessa:

Muslim tradition tells of a similar account, known as the second pledge at al-Aqabah. Sebeos&#x27; account suggests that Muhammad was actually leading a joint venture toward Palestine, instead of a Jewish-Arab alliance against the Meccan pagans toward the south.

=== Middle Ages ===

The Byzantine Empire often tried to retake Edessa, especially under Romanos I Lekapenos, who obtained from the inhabitants the &quot;Image of Edessa&quot;, an ancient portrait of Christ, and solemnly transferred it to Constantinople, August 16, 944. This was the final great achievement of Romanus&#x27;s reign. This venerable and famous image, which was certainly at Edessa in 544, and of which there is an ancient copy in the Vatican Library, was looted and brought to the West by the Republic of Venice in 1207 following the Fourth Crusade. The city was ruled shortly thereafter by Marwanids.
In 1031 Edessa was given up to the Byzantines under George Maniakes by its Arab governor. It was retaken by the Arabs, and then successively held by the Romans, the Armenians, the Seljuq dynasty (1087), an Armenian named Thoros who gained independence from the Turks (1094), and the Crusaders (1098), who established there the County of Edessa and kept the city until 1144, when it was again captured by Imad ad-Din Zengi, and most of its inhabitants were allegedly slaughtered together with the Latin archbishop. These events are known to us chiefly through the Armenian historian Matthew, who had been born at Edessa. In 1144 the city had an Armenian population of 47,000. In 1146, the city was briefly recaptured by the crusaders and lost after a few days. In the words of Steven Runciman, &quot;the whole Christian population was driven into exile [and t]he great city, which claimed to be the oldest Christian commonwealth in the world, was left empty and desolate, and has never recovered to this day.&quot;

The Ayyubid Sultanate&#x27;s leader Saladin acquired the town from the Zengids in 1182. During Ayyubid rule, Edessa had a population of approximately 24,000. The Sultanate of Rûm took Edessa in June 1234, but sometime in late 1234 or 1235, the Ayyubid sultan Al-Kamil re-acquired it. After Edessa had been recaptured, Al-Kamil ordered the destruction of its Citadel. Not long after, the Mongols had made their presence known in Edessa in 1244. Later, the Ilkhanate sent troops to Edessa in 1260 at which point the town voluntarily submitted to them. The populace of Edessa were thus saved from being massacred by the Mongols. Edessa was also held by the Mamluk Sultanate, and the Aq Qoyunlu.

=== Subsequent history ===

Edessa was subsequently controlled by the Safavid dynasty, and from 1517 to 1918 the Ottoman Empire.

Under the Ottomans in 1518, the population of Edessa was estimated at a mere 5,500; likely due to the Ottoman–Persian Wars. By 1566, though, the population had risen to an estimated 14,000 citizens. In 1890, the population of Edessa consisted of 55,000, of which the Muslim population made up 40,835.

==Syriac literature==

The oldest known dated Syriac manuscripts (AD 411 and 462), containing Greek patristic texts, come from Edessa.

Following are some of the famous individuals connected with Edessa:
# Jacob Baradaeus, an ardent Miaphysite who preserved the (Oriental) Orthodox church after the persecution subsequent to the Chalcedonian controversy Jacobites
# Jacob, Bishop of Edessa, a prolific writer (d. 708);
# Theophilus, an astronomer, who translated into Syriac verse Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;;
# Stephen Bar Sudaïli, monk and pantheist, to whom was owing, in Palestine, the last crisis of Origenism in the 6th century
# The anonymous author of the &quot;Chronicon Edessenum&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot;), compiled in 540
# The anonymous writer of the story of &quot;The Man of God&quot;, in the 5th century, which gave rise to the legend of St. Alexius, also known as Alexius of Rome (because exiled Eastern monks brought his cult and bones to Rome in the 10th century).
#Basil bar Shumna (d. c. 1170) bishop who wrote a chronicle of the city&#x27;s history (now lost)
#Cyrus of Edessa, 6th century Syriac Christian writer
#John bar Aphtonia, a key figure in the transmission of Greek thought and literary culture into a Syriac milieu
#Thaddeus of Edessa, Christian saint and one of the seventy disciples of Jesus
#Maurelius of Voghenza, Syrian priest

<doc id="285459" wikidata="Q210308" url="?curid=285459" title="Lawrence Eagleburger">
<text>Lawrence Sidney Eagleburger (August 1, 1930 – June 4, 2011) was an American and career diplomat, who served briefly as the secretary of state under President George H. W. Bush from December 1992 to January 1993, one of the shortest terms in modern history. Previously, he had served in lesser capacities under Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan, and as deputy secretary of state to James Baker under George H. W. Bush. Eagleburger is the only career Foreign Service Officer to have served as secretary of state. He was also Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (international security affairs) from January to May 1973. As a career member of the United States Senior Foreign Service, he attained the rank of Career Ambassador on April 12, 1984.

== Early life and education ==
Eagleburger was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Helen (), an elementary school teacher, and Leon Sidney Eagleburger, a medical doctor. He graduated from Jacobs High School in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, then attended Stevens Point State College (now the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point), before earning his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from the University of Wisconsin. During his time at Wisconsin, he joined Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.

He was also a member of the Board of Visitors at the College of William &amp; Mary from 1996 to 2000 and from 2002 to 2006.

Eagleburger also served in the United States Army (1952–1954), attaining the rank of first lieutenant.

== Governmental career ==
In 1957, Eagleburger joined the United States Foreign Service, and served in various posts in embassies, consulates, and the Department of State. From 1961 to 1965 he served as a staffer at the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He was known as the person who handled the Skopje 1963 earthquake crisis, and managed the first US-Soviet humanitarian cooperation, after which he was nicknamed Lawrence of Macedonia.

Starting in 1969, he served in the Nixon administration as an assistant to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger. He stayed in this appointment until 1971; thereafter he took on several positions, including advisor to the U.S. Mission to NATO in Brussels, and, following Kissinger&#x27;s appointment as secretary of state, a number of additional posts in the State Department and deputy assistant secretary of defense (1971–73).

Following Nixon&#x27;s resignation, he briefly left government service. He was then named the executive secretary to the secretary of state from 1975 to 1977, and subsequently was appointed as ambassador to Yugoslavia by President Jimmy Carter, a post he held from 1977 to 1980. While working as Executive Secretary to Kissinger in 1975 he carried out secret talks with the Cubans in New York City.

From May 14, 1981, to January 26, 1982, Eagleburger was assistant secretary of state for European affairs. In 1982, Reagan appointed him as undersecretary of state for political affairs (the State Department&#x27;s third-ranking position), a position he held for several years. He attained the rank of Career Ambassador in the Senior Foreign Service on April 12, 1984. He then became president of Kissinger Associates, a consultancy firm which provided firms with advice on international politics. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed him deputy secretary of state (the department&#x27;s second-ranking position); he also served as the President&#x27;s primary advisor for affairs relating to the quickly disintegrating Yugoslavia. On August 23, 1992, James Baker resigned as secretary of state (to manage Bush&#x27;s unsuccessful re-election campaign), and Eagleburger served as acting secretary of state until Bush gave him a recess appointment for the remainder of the Bush administration.

His period as advisor for Yugoslavian affairs from 1989 to 1992 was controversial as he gained a reputation for being a strong Serbian partisan. This perceived partisanship led the European press to dub him &quot;Lawrence of Serbia&quot; (a reference to Lawrence of Arabia). Eagleburger had controversial ties to Yugoslavia both in promoting loans to Yugoslavia as a government official and later serving on the board of a Yugoslav-government-owned LBS Bank (Ljubljanska Banka) as well as with Yugo Motors, USA. About one-quarter of LBS Bank&#x27;s business came from Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, whose Atlanta branch was instrumental in diverting U.S. agricultural loans to arms purchases by Saddam Hussein.

In 1991, President Bush awarded him the Presidential Citizens Medal. He was a member of the board of directors of the International Republican Institute.

== International Commission on Holocaust-Era Insurance Claims ==
Eagleburger became chairman of the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, or ICHEIC, which was set up in 1998. The purpose of the commission was to resolve unpaid Nazi-era insurance claims for survivors of the Holocaust. In 2005, Eagleburger announced that the ICHEIC was offering approximately 16 million dollars to Holocaust victims and their heirs, noting as he did so the research ability of the ICHEIC staff which allowed them to evaluate claims from companies which no longer existed. In the years prior to this there had been some controversy about the commission, including reports that it was over-budgeted and too slow, and that insurance companies which had previously agreed to work with the ICHEIC had failed to disclose policyholder lists. Eagleburger responded to these accusations by saying, among other things, that it was difficult to work quickly when many of the claimants lacked basic information such as the name of the insurance company involved.

== Stance on Middle Eastern conflict ==

After serving in the Foreign Service for 27 years, Eagleburger retained an interest in foreign policy and was a familiar figure on current events talk shows. He caused some discussion with public comments about President George W. Bush&#x27;s foreign policy. In August 2002, Eagleburger questioned the timing of possible military action in Iraq, saying, &quot;I am not at all convinced now that this is something we have to do this very moment.&quot; He did indicate he believed that Iraqi regime change could be a legitimate U.S. endeavor at some point, but that at that time he did not believe the administration was fully prepared for such a conflict. In April 2003, following warnings by the Bush administration to the government of Syria, Eagleburger condemned the possibility of military action in Syria or Iran, saying that public opinion would not support such a move and that &quot;If President Bush were to try it now, even I would feel he should be skinned alive.&quot;

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. On November 10, 2006 it was announced that he would replace Secretary of Defense designate Robert Gates in the Iraq Study Group.

After the election of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Eagleburger seemed to think that Iran was moving in a direction which may at some point call for military action, saying in an interview that while &quot;we should try everything else we can first&quot;, at some point it would probably be necessary to use force to ensure that Iran did not obtain or use nuclear weapons.

He was chairman of the board of trustees for The Forum for International Policy, and a member of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) Board of Advisors.

== 2008 presidential election ==
Before the Republican primaries, Eagleburger endorsed John McCain for president. In an NPR interview on October 30, 2008, he described McCain&#x27;s running-mate Sarah Palin as &quot;not prepared&quot; for top office. He also stated that many vice presidents have not been ready. The next day, in an interview on Fox News, he retracted his comments about Palin.

On October 30, 2008, on the Fox News Channel, Eagleburger referred to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama as a &quot;charlatan&quot;, citing his fundraising methods and other aspects of his presidential campaign.

== Death ==
Eagleburger died of pneumonia at the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, Virginia, on June 4, 2011. He was 80 years old and had lived outside Charlottesville since 1990. He is survived by his three sons.

President Barack Obama described Eagleburger as a &quot;distinguished diplomat and public servant who devoted his life to the security of our nation and to strengthening our ties with allies and partners.&quot; Former President George H. W. Bush described Eagleburger as &quot;a tireless patriot, principled to the core, selflessly devoted to America and his duty.&quot; Vice President Joe Biden remarked &quot;The post-Cold War world [...] is more stable and secure because of Eagleburger&#x27;s service.&quot; &quot;Larry believed in the strength of America&#x27;s values, and he fought for them around the world,&quot; said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Lawrence and his wife Marlene Ann are both interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

== Personal life ==
He had three sons, all of whom are named Lawrence Eagleburger, though they have different middle names (Scott, Andrew and Jason). When discussing his decision to give his three children the same first name, Eagleburger stated &quot;It was ego,&quot; adding, &quot;and secondly, I wanted to screw up the Social Security system.&quot;

His eldest son is from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. The younger two are from his second marriage, which was to Marlene Ann Heinemann from 1966 until her death in 2010.

<text>Pascal Quignard (; born 23 April 1948) is a French writer born in Verneuil-sur-Avre, Eure. In 2002 his novel &quot;Les Ombres errantes&quot; (&quot;The Roving Shadows&quot;) won the Prix Goncourt, France&#x27;s top literary prize. &quot;Terrasse à Rome&quot; (&quot;A Terrace in Rome&quot;), received the French Academy prize in 2000. In 1980 &quot;Carus&quot; had been awarded the Prix des Critiques. He also won the 2023 Prix Formentor.

Among Quignard&#x27;s most commented-upon works are his eighty-four &quot;Little Treatises&quot; (&quot;Petits traités&quot;), first published in 1990 by Maeght. But his most popular book is probably &quot;All the World&#x27;s Mornings&quot; (&quot;Tous les matins du monde&quot;), about 17th-century viola de gamba player Marin Marais and his teacher, Sainte-Colombe, which was adapted for the screen in 1991, by director Alain Corneau. Quignard wrote the screenplay of the film, in collaboration with Corneau. &quot;Tous les matins du monde&quot;, starring Jean-Pierre Marielle, Gérard Depardieu and son Guillaume Depardieu, was a tremendous success in France and sold 2 million tickets in the first year. It was subsequently distributed in 31 countries, and released in 1992 in the United States. The soundtrack was certified platinum (500,000 copies) and contributed to musician Jordi Savall’s international celebrity. 
Quignard has also translated works from the Latin (Porcius Latro), Chinese (Kong-souen Long), and Greek (Lycophron).

<doc id="285475" wikidata="Q51801270" url="?curid=285475" title="Mack the Knife">
<text>&quot;Mack the Knife&quot; or &quot;The Ballad of Mack the Knife&quot; () is a song composed by Kurt Weill with lyrics by Bertolt Brecht for their 1928 music drama &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (). The song tells of a knife-wielding criminal of the London underworld named Macheath, the &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; of the title.

The song has become a popular standard recorded by many artists after it was recorded by Louis Armstrong in 1955 with translated lyrics by Marc Blitzstein. The most popular version of the song was by Bobby Darin in 1959, whose recording became a number one hit in the US and UK and earned him two Grammys at the 2nd Annual Grammy Awards. Ella Fitzgerald also received a Grammy for her performance of the song in 1961.

The original German lyrics and music of the song entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

== &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; ==

A &quot;Moritat&quot; is a medieval version of the murder ballad performed by strolling minstrels. In &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, the singer with his street organ introduces and closes the drama with the tale of the deadly &quot;Mackie Messer&quot;, or &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, a character based on the dashing highwayman Macheath in John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (who was in turn based on the historical thief Jack Sheppard). The Brecht-Weill version of the character was far more cruel and sinister whose crimes included rape and murder, transforming him into a modern antihero.

The song was a last-minute addition that was inserted before its premiere in 1928 because Harald Paulsen, the actor who played Macheath, demanded that Brecht and Weill add another number that would more effectively introduce his character. However, Weill and Brecht decided the song should not be sung by Macheath himself, opting instead to write the song for a street singer in keeping with the tradition. At the premiere, the song was sung by Kurt Gerron, who played Police Chief Brown. Weill intended the Moritat to be accompanied by a barrel organ, which was to be played by the singer. At the premiere, though, the barrel organ failed, and the pit orchestra (a jazz band) had to quickly provide the accompaniment for the street singer.

The singer introduces the play, first comparing Macheath to a shark:

This is followed by tales of his crimes including a murder on the Strand, the disappearance of a wealthy man and theft of his money, a fatal stabbing of a woman, an arson that killed seven children in Soho, and the rape of a young widow.

The final stanza – not included in the original play, but added by Brecht for the 1931 film – expresses the theme and compares the glittering world of the rich and powerful with the dark world of the poor:
=== French translation ===
The song was translated into French as &quot;&quot; by André Mauprey and Ninon Steinhoff and popularized by Catherine Sauvage.

=== 1954 Blitzstein translation ===

The song was introduced to American audiences in 1933 in the first English-language production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. The English lyrics were by Gifford Cochran and Jerrold Krimsky. That production, however, was not successful, closing after a run of only ten days. The best-known English translation of the song comes from Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s 1954 version of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, which played Off-Broadway for over six years. The opening stanza reads:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear,
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jack-knife has Macheath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
&lt;/poem&gt;

Blitzstein&#x27;s version is a loose translation of the German lyrics; some lines on the crimes of Macheath have been omitted, and he included a verse not in the original, giving a list of female characters in the drama. The lyrics were further sanitized in the original Broadway cast recording (with Gerald Price as the ballad singer) with two stanzas on Macheath&#x27;s assaults on women replaced. 

Blitzstein&#x27;s translation forms the basis of most of the popular versions heard today, including those by Louis Armstrong (1955) and Bobby Darin (1959), and most subsequent swing versions. Some further changes were made to Blitzstein&#x27;s lyrics, for example, in Armstrong&#x27;s recording, the name of Weill&#x27;s widow, Lotte Lenya, who was the star of both the original 1928 German production and the 1954 Blitzstein Broadway version, was added to the lyrics &quot;(Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya)&quot;.

=== 1976 Manheim–Willett extension (&quot;&quot;) ===
In 1976, a brand-new interpretation of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; by Ralph Manheim and John Willett was used in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, starring Raul Julia as Macheath. This version, simply known as &quot;&quot;, is an extension of the story with completely new lyrics that expound upon the tales of Macheath&#x27;s trail of activity. Here is an excerpt:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;See the shark with teeth like razors.
All can read his open face.
And Macheath has got a knife, but
Not in such an obvious place.&lt;/poem&gt;

This version was performed by Lyle Lovett on the soundtrack of the 1994 film &quot;Quiz Show&quot;. Darin&#x27;s version plays over the opening credits and Lovett&#x27;s over the closing credits. This interpretation was performed by Sting on Hal Willner&#x27;s 1985 Weill tribute album &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; and also recorded by Nick Cave in the late 1990s.

=== 1994 translation ===
A much darker translation by Robert David MacDonald and Jeremy Sams into English was used for the 1994 Donmar Warehouse theatrical production in London. The new translation attempted to recapture the original tone of the song:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Though the shark&#x27;s teeth may be lethal
Still you see them white and red
But you won&#x27;t see Mackie&#x27;s flick knife
Cause he slashed you and you&#x27;re dead.&lt;/poem&gt;

== Popular recordings ==

===Louis Armstrong version===
A number of early artists recorded the song, including the cast recording and a jazz version by Sidney Bechet, but it was Louis Armstrong who first introduced the vocal version of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; to the United States hit parade. George Avakian, a producer at Columbia Records, whose wife Anahid Ajemian gave a recital of Weill&#x27;s Violin Concerto in 1954, became interested in Weill&#x27;s music, in particular the song from the off-Broadway production of &quot;Three Penny Opera&quot; that he had seen. He spent a few months trying to interest various jazz artists from his label to record &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, eventually persuading Turk Murphy to record. Murphy also suggested Armstrong to Avakian for the recording, and made an arrangement of the song for him.

Armstrong recorded an instrumental together with a vocal version on September 28, 1955, while Murphy also recorded both instrumental version and vocal versions himself as well as one in German with Lotte Lenya on September 22, 1955. The lyrics of Armstrong&#x27;s version were based on the Broadway cast recording, but Avakian suggested changing Blitzstein&#x27;s lyrics by using the word &quot;drooping&quot; instead of &quot;dropping&quot;, as well as including the name of Lotte Lenya in the recording. Armstrong gave a shout-out in the song to Lenya who was invited to the recording session by Avakian. Lenya also joined Armstrong to record a duet version which was not released commercially in their lifetime, but was released posthumously in 1982. 

The version released by Armstrong was spliced together from the instrumental and the vocal recordings. The song, titled &quot;A Theme from The Threepenny Opera (Mack the Knife)&quot;, was released in late 1955 together with an instrumental version by Murphy, both by Columbia. The song, however, faced an initial ban on the song by radio stations for lyrics perceived as glorification of a criminal, although it sold well. Armstrong&#x27;s recording reached &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 100 chart in February 1956, peaking at No 20 on March 17, 1956. An instrumental version released by Dick Hyman charted higher. Armstrong&#x27;s version also reached No. 8 in the UK.

In 1997, the 1955 recording of the song by Louis Armstrong &amp; His All-Stars on Columbia Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Armstrong&#x27;s recording was inducted by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry in 2016.

====Charts====
===Bobby Darin version===
The song, however, is most closely associated with Bobby Darin, who recorded his version on December 19, 1958 for his album &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot;. Darin had performed the song in his act before, and wanted to include the song in an album of standards. The song was arranged by Richard Wess. Musicians who played on the song included Don Lamond on drums, Milt Hinton on bass, and Doc Severinsen on trumpet. Tom Dowd engineered the recording. Darin&#x27;s version has similar lyrics to Armstrong&#x27;s but with small changes, such as using the word &quot;babe&quot; instead of &quot;dear&#x27;, and he ended the song with a reprise of the sixth verse instead of the first. Darin recorded the song in around three takes, performing the song with an up-tempo bouncy beat and modulating up a semitone every verse starting with the third verse, from B-flat to B to C to D-flat to E-flat.

The song was released as a single in August 1959, even though Darin was reluctant to release the song as a single. Dick Clark had advised Darin not to record the song because of the perception that, having come from an opera, the song might not appeal to a rock and roll audience; he subsequently acknowledged his error. The song reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (Darin&#x27;s only number 1 hit on the Hot 100) and number six on the Black Singles Chart. It was listed as a &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 number one single in 1959 for eight weeks. 

====Reception====
Frank Sinatra (who would record his own version in the 1980s with Quincy Jones for his &quot;L.A. Is My Lady&quot; album) called Darin&#x27;s the &quot;definitive&quot; version.

&quot;Billboard&quot; ranked this version as the No. 2 song for 1959. In 2003, the Darin version was ranked No. 251 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list. Darin&#x27;s version of the song was featured in the films &quot;Quiz Show&quot; and &quot;What Women Want&quot;.

The song earned Darin two Grammy Awards in 1959, for Record of the Year and first ever Best New Artist. Darin&#x27;s version was also inducted by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry at the same time as Armstrong&#x27;s in 2016. It was ranked as No. 15 in the list of Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 1999, the 1959 release of the song by Bobby Darin on the Atco Records label was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

====Certifications====

===Ella Fitzgerald version===
On February 13, 1960, Ella Fitzgerald performed the song live for the first time in a concert at Deutschlandhalle in Berlin. Fitzgerald, however, forgot the lyrics after the first stanza, and she improvised new lyrics, including name-checking Louis Armstrong and Bobby Darin. The song was included on the album &quot;Ella in Berlin: Mack the Knife&quot; released in July.

The song was released as a single in April 1960. This version made the US Hot 100, peaking at No. 27 in June 1960. This song was Fitzgerald&#x27;s best performing song in the 1960s, and she included the song in all her subsequent shows.

The performance earned Fitzgerald a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 3rd Annual Grammy Awards.

====Charts====
===Instrumental versions===

An instrumental version of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; titled &quot;Moritat – A Theme From &quot;The Three Penny Opera&quot;&quot; was recorded by Dick Hyman, and it performed better than Louis Armstrong&#x27;s vocal version that charted around the same time, reaching No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 100. It also reached No. 9 on the Cashbox chart, as well as No. 9 on the UK chart in 1956. A number of other instrumental versions also appeared on The Top 100 at the same time: Richard Hayman and Jan August (No. 12), Lawrence Welk (No. 31), Billy Vaughn (No. 37), and Les Paul and Mary Ford (No.49). Billy Vaughn also reached No. 12 in the UK.

Jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins recorded an instrumental version titled simply &quot;&quot; for his album &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;, recorded in 1956. A 1959 instrumental performance by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets was the final song the group recorded for Decca Records. Ray Conniff recorded a version for orchestra and chorus in 1962 for the album, &quot;The Happy Beat&quot;. Liberace performed the song in five styles: as originally written, in the style of the &quot;Blue Danube Waltz&quot;, as a music box, in a bossa nova rhythm, and in boogie-woogie.

===Other versions===
Frank Sinatra added the song to his repertoire in 1984 in an arrangement by Frank Foster; In the performance included on his album &quot;L.A. Is My Lady&quot;, Sinatra similarly name-checked Armstrong and Darin, as well as adding members of his backing band. Sinatra and Jimmy Buffett recorded a duet of the song for Sinatra&#x27;s final album &quot;Duets II&quot; (1994).

Nick Cave and Spanish Fly performed the song for the video &quot;September Songs – The Music of Kurt Weill&quot; in 1994, released as an album in 1997. while Sting and Dominic Muldowney recorded it for the 1985 tribute album &quot;Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill&quot;.

Other notable versions include performances by Mark Lanegan, Dave Van Ronk, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Tony Bennett, Anita O&#x27;Day (in an arrangement by Jimmy Giuffre), Marianne Faithfull, Brian Setzer, Dr. John, Ute Lemper, King Kurt, Bing Crosby, Eartha Kitt, The Psychedelic Furs, David Cassidy (in &quot;At the Copa&quot;), Westlife, The Doors, and Michael Bublé. Swiss band The Young Gods radically reworked the song in industrial style on their 1991 album &quot;The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill&quot; as &quot;Mackie Messer&quot;, Deana Martin recorded &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; on her second studio album, &quot;Volare&quot;, released in 2009 by Big Fish Records. Robbie Williams recorded the song on his 2001 album &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot;. Hildegard Knef recorded a German version, &quot;Mackie Messer&quot;.

Salsa musician Rubén Blades recorded an homage entitled &quot;Pedro Navaja&quot; (Razor Pete). Brazilian composer Chico Buarque, in his loose adaptation of &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; (), made two versions called &quot; and &quot;, with lyrics in Portuguese.

1950s comedic legend Ernie Kovacs used a German-translated version of the song throughout his television series.

<text>vCard, also known as VCF (&quot;Virtual Contact File&quot;), is a file format standard for electronic business cards. vCards can be attached to e-mail messages, sent via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), on the World Wide Web, instant messaging, NFC or through QR code. They can contain name and address information, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, URLs, logos, photographs, and audio clips.

vCard is used as a data interchange format in smartphone contacts, personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal information managers (PIMs) and customer relationship management systems (CRMs). To accomplish these data interchange applications, other &quot;vCard variants&quot; have been used and proposed as &quot;variant standards&quot;, each for its specific niche: XML representation, JSON representation, or web pages. 

== Overview ==
The standard Internet media type (MIME type) for a vCard has varied with each version of the specification.

vCards can be embedded in web pages.

RDFa with the vCard Ontology can be used in HTML and various XML-family languages, e.g. SVG, MathML.

== Related formats ==
jCard, &quot;The JSON Format for vCard&quot; is a standard proposal of 2014 in . RFC 7095 describes a lossless method of representing vCard instances in JSON, using arrays of sequence-dependent tag–value pairs. jCard has been incorporated into several other protocols, including RDAP, the Protocol to Access White Space Databases (PAWS, described in ), and SIP, which (via ) uses it to provide contact information for the operator of an intermediary which has rejected a call.

hCard is a microformat that allows a vCard to be embedded inside an HTML page. It makes use of CSS class names to identify each vCard property. Normal HTML markup and CSS styling can be used alongside the hCard class names without affecting the webpage&#x27;s ability to be parsed by a hCard parser. h-card is the microformats2 update to hCard.

MeCard is a variation of vCard made by NTT DoCoMo for smartphones using QR codes. It uses a very similar syntax, but in a more consolidated way as the storage space on QR codes is limited. It&#x27;s also limited in the amount of data that can be stored, not just by the standard but the size of QR codes.

== Example ==

An example of a simple vCard (from RFC 6350 of August, 2011, abbreviated):

 BEGIN:VCARD
 VERSION:4.0
 FN:Simon Perreault
 N:Perreault;Simon;;;ing. jr,M.Sc.
 BDAY:--0203
 GENDER:M
 EMAIL;TYPE=work:simon.perreault@viagenie.ca
 END:VCARD

This is the vCard for &quot;Simon Perreault&quot; (the author of RFC 6350), with his birthday (omitting the year), email address and gender.

== Properties ==
vCard defines the following property types.

All vCards begin with codice_1 and end with codice_2. All vCards must contain the codice_3 property, which specifies the vCard version. codice_3 must come immediately after codice_5, except in the vCard 2.1 and 3.0 standards, which allows it to be anywhere in the vCard. Otherwise, properties can be defined in any order.

<text>Michel Tournier (; 19 December 1924 − 18 January 2016) was a French writer. He won awards such as the &quot;Grand Prix du roman de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; in 1967 for &quot;Friday, or, The Other Island&quot; and the Prix Goncourt for &quot;The Erl-King&quot; in 1970. 
His inspirations included traditional German culture, Catholicism and the philosophies of Gaston Bachelard. He resided in Choisel and was a member of the Académie Goncourt. His autobiography has been translated and published as &quot;The Wind Spirit&quot; (Beacon Press, 1988). He was on occasion in contention for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Biography==
Born in France of parents who met at the Sorbonne while studying German, Tournier spent his youth in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. He learned German early, staying each summer in Germany. He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and at the university of Tübingen and attended Maurice de Gandillac&#x27;s course. He wished to teach philosophy at high-school but, like his father, failed to obtain the French agrégation.

Tournier joined Radio France as a journalist and translator and hosted &quot;L&#x27;heure de la culture française&quot;. In 1954 he worked in advertisement for Europe 1. He also collaborated for &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. From 1958 to 1968, Tournier was the chief editor of Plon. In 1967 Tournier published his first book, &quot;Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique&quot;, a retelling of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, for which he was awarded the &quot;Grand Prix du roman de l&#x27;Académie française&quot;.

He co-founded in 1970, with the Arles photographer Lucien Clergue and the historian Jean-Maurice Rouquette, the Rencontres d&#x27;Arles. At the same time he produced for television some fifty issues of the monthly program &quot;Chambre noire&quot;, devoted to photography interviewing a photographer for each program.

Tournier died on 18 January 2016 in Choisel, France at the age of 91.

<doc id="285481" wikidata="Q699792" url="?curid=285481" title="Ranma Saotome">
<text>is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of the manga series &quot;Ranma ½&quot;, created by Rumiko Takahashi. Ranma is a Japanese teenage boy who has trained in martial arts since early childhood. As a result of falling into an enchanted spring during a training journey in China, he is cursed to transform into a girl when splashed with cold water, while hot water changes him back into a boy. Throughout the series, Ranma seeks out a way to rid himself of the curse, while his friends, enemies, rivals, and many fiancées constantly hinder and interfere.

==Creation and conception==
Because most of her previous series had female protagonists, Rumiko Takahashi decided that she wanted a male for &quot;Ranma ½&quot;. However, she was worried about writing a male main character in a magazine targeted toward male readers, and therefore decided to make him half-female. In 1993, an &quot;Animerica&quot; interviewer asked Takahashi if she intended the sex-changing theme &quot;as an effort to enlighten a male-dominated society.&quot; The author said that she does not think in terms of societal agendas and that she created the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; concept from wanting &quot;a simple, fun idea.&quot; She considered Ranma changing every time he was punched, before deciding on water for initiating his changes after thinking of &quot;noren&quot; at &quot;sentō&quot; and making the hot and cold water connection.

Takahashi said she gave the character&#x27;s name a lot of thought; because the series deals with &quot;a lot of entangled elements in an effective way&quot; she named him Ranma taken from the proverb , which can roughly be translated into English as &quot;tackling plenty of tasks diligently.&quot; However, when asked how she came up with it in another interview years later, Takahashi simply said she thought it would be a cute name for either a boy or girl. Male Ranma&#x27;s name is written using kanji, while Female Ranma&#x27;s name is written in hiragana as . The manga artist gave Ranma a pigtail to make the character easy to identify regardless of whether he was in his male or female form. Because a pigtail pairs well with Chinese clothes, she then decided to make him a martial artist.

Takahashi said that Ranma&#x27;s personality ended up different from how she initially intended; &quot;I originally intended for him to be a clean-cut, incredibly energetic kid who was into fighting. But, he became somewhat indecisive and picky.&quot; She speculated that, since everyone has those kinds of sentiments, these were her own feelings subconsciously reflected in her character. When Takahashi was asked if there was a connection between the characters Ryunosuke Fujinami and her father from her previous manga &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and the characters of Ranma and his father Genma, the author said &quot;Perhaps there is something in their relationship, that has crossed over to the relationship between Ranma and Genma. I think that could be true.&quot; In 1994, Takahashi said she was planning to have Ranma and Akane Tendo end up together at the end of &quot;Ranma ½&quot;.

Takahashi sat in on the voice actor auditions for the anime adaptation and, when both male and female Ranma were going to be voiced by the same actor, she insisted that they be voiced by different actors whose gender corresponded to that of the part. In Japanese, Ranma&#x27;s male form is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi and his female form by Megumi Hayashibara. The character was Yamaguchi&#x27;s debut voice acting role. Hayashibara actually auditioned to play Akane Tendo, but was chosen to be the female half of Ranma instead. In English, male Ranma was voiced by Sarah Strange in the OVAs, films and first 64 episodes of the TV anime, before Richard Ian Cox took over the role. The female version of Ranma was voiced in English by Brigitta Dau for only six episodes before she was replaced by Venus Terzo. In the live-action TV film adaptation, male Ranma is portrayed by Kento Kaku and female Ranma by Natsuna Watanabe.

==Appearances==
16-year-old Ranma Saotome has been trained in martial arts by his father Genma since childhood, namely in the or &quot;Anything-Goes&quot; style. When Ranma was a toddler, Genma took him from home and set out on their journey, vowing to his wife that he would make their son a &quot;true man among men.&quot; As such Ranma does not even remember his mother. While training in the Bayankala Mountain Range in the Qinghai Province of China, Ranma and Genma fell into cursed springs at Jusenkyo. When someone falls into a cursed spring, they take the physical form of whatever drowned there thousands of years ago whenever they come into contact with cold water. The curse will revert when exposed to hot water until their next cold water exposure. Ranma fell into the spring of a drowned girl, while Genma fell into the spring of a drowned panda bear.

Two weeks after the accident, they move in with Genma&#x27;s old friend Soun Tendo at his Nerima, Tokyo home, with the expectation that one of his three daughters will marry Ranma. The eldest Kasumi and middle sibling Nabiki force their little sister Akane to accept the betrothal. Akane and Ranma instantly dislike each other due to Akane&#x27;s mistrust of boys and Ranma&#x27;s derision of her, but they drift closer throughout the series, each going to great lengths to save the other when in trouble. Ranma enrolls in Furinkan High School where he meets Tatewaki Kuno, the arrogant captain of the kendo club who is in love with Akane and who also falls in love with Ranma&#x27;s female form, never realizing that she and male Ranma are the same person. Additionally, Kuno&#x27;s younger sister, the gymnast Kodachi, soon develops a crush on the male Ranma.

Ranma&#x27;s childhood rival, the perpetually lost Ryoga Hibiki, finds his way to Nerima seeking revenge on him as he is cursed to turn into a small black piglet after falling in a cursed spring when he followed Ranma to China. Ryoga comes to also see Ranma as a rival in love, as he develops a crush on Akane. When Ranma was in China, he defeated Chinese Amazon Shampoo in combat while in his female form. Shampoo&#x27;s local custom dictates that female warriors kill the woman that defeats them, as such she tracks Ranma to Nerima. However, she is then defeated by Ranma again in his male form, and Chinese Amazon custom demands that female warriors marry the man that defeats them, as such Shampoo pursues male Ranma as her fiancé.

Ukyo Kuonji, an okonomiyaki chef and Ranma&#x27;s childhood friend, also appears in town seeking revenge. While on a training journey with a young Ranma, Genma agreed to have his son marry Ukyo in an arranged marriage with her family&#x27;s okonomiyaki cart acting as the dowry, but he took the cart and left Ukyo behind. For the next ten years Ukyo rejected her femininity and trained to get revenge on the Saotomes. As children, Ranma did not know that Ukyo was female and when he finds out he calls her &quot;cute,&quot; which causes Ukyo to forgive the past and treat Ranma as her fiancé.

Although Ranma despises his sex-changing curse, he is not beyond using it to his advantage. In order to interfere on Ryoga&#x27;s date with Akane, Ranma tricks his gullible rival into thinking his female form is the younger sister Ryoga never knew, Yoiko. When Ranma&#x27;s mother Nodoka comes to town and Ranma learns that his father promised her that he and his son would commit suicide via &quot;seppuku&quot; if he failed to raise Ranma into a &quot;true man among men,&quot; Ranma passes himself off as Ranko, Akane&#x27;s tomboy cousin, while Genma pretends to be Ranko&#x27;s pet panda. When Nodoka finally does learn that &quot;Ranko&quot; is Ranma, she waives demanding &quot;seppuku&quot; and remarks that even as Ranko her son acted &quot;manly.&quot; However, she does grab her &quot;katana&quot; whenever she sees him doing something that could be misunderstood as feminine.

==Reception==

In both 1990 and 1991, Ranma came in second place in &quot;Animage&quot;″s annual Anime Grand Prix for Favorite Male Character and fourth in its Favorite Female Character category. Male Ranma dropped one spot to third place in 1992, while female Ranma fell to seventh. Male Ranma regained second place in 1993, but his female form fell to 12th. In 1994, Ranma came in 15th place in the male category. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw Ranma voted the fifth favorite character from all of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s works. In a poll conducted by goo, fans voted female Ranma their third favorite anime role performed by Megumi Hayashibara. With 18.1% of the vote, female Ranma came in first in a goo poll of 250 men and 250 women on &quot;cute redhead girl&quot; anime characters. Anime News Network&#x27;s Gia Manry listed Ranma&#x27;s engagement to Shampoo as the third Most Awkward Proposal in anime.

Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network called Ranma the &quot;least formed&quot; character of the series as of the first two volumes of the manga. She wrote that &quot;at first he feels badly about his affliction [and] how it affects others, but by the middle of the book he&#x27;s started using it to his advantage, and really, it&#x27;s hard to blame him there.&quot; and noted that Ranma clearly likes Akane much more than she likes him. Her colleague Theron Martin wrote that Ranma and Akane are &quot;firmly anchored in the territory of clearly caring about each other even though they do not want to admit it.&quot; Todd Douglass Jr. of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; wrote that seeing their developing relationship is one of the initial hooks of the anime and is truly entertaining. &quot;The Fandom Post&quot;″s Kory Cerjak called the &quot;not-so-relationship&quot; a constant form of entertainment due to &quot;how they interact when they’re hating each other and when they’re being smitten.&quot; Commenting on how many people feel the ending of &quot;Ranma ½&quot; does not resolve anything, Jason Thompson wrote that &quot;expecting to see Ranma marry Akane is like expecting to see Uncle Scrooge marry Glitterin&#x27; Goldie or Archie marry Veronica [...] it just doesn&#x27;t happen.&quot;

Martin called Venus Terzo&#x27;s English performance as female Ranma a vast improvement over Brigitta Dau&#x27;s and said it elevates the rest of the dub to an overall acceptable level. He wrote that the change was supposedly done due to fan complaints, which he called &quot;entirely believable&quot; given how &quot;grating&quot; Dau&#x27;s performance is. Martin wrote that the English voice actor change from Sarah Strange as male Ranma to Richard Ian Cox takes some time to get used to due to how substantially it alters Ranma&#x27;s voice and delivery.

<text>The color of chemicals is a physical property of chemicals that in most cases comes from the excitation of electrons due to an absorption of energy performed by the chemical.

The study of chemical structure by means of energy absorption and release is generally referred to as spectroscopy.

== Theory ==

All atoms and molecules are capable of absorbing and releasing energy in the form of photons, accompanied by a change of quantum state. The amount of energy absorbed or released is the difference between the energies of the two quantum states. There are various types of quantum state, including, for example, the rotational and vibrational states of a molecule. However the release of energy visible to the human eye, commonly referred to as visible light, spans the wavelengths approximately 380 nm to 760 nm, depending on the individual, and photons in this range usually accompany a change in atomic or molecular orbital quantum state. The perception of light is governed by three types of color receptors in the eye, which are sensitive to different ranges of wavelength within this band.

The relationship between energy and wavelength is determined by the Planck-Einstein relation
: formula_1
where &quot;E&quot; is the energy of the quantum (photon), &quot;f&quot; is the frequency of the light wave, &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.

The relationships between the energies of the various quantum states are treated by atomic orbital, molecular orbital, Ligand Field Theory and Crystal Field Theory. If photons of a particular wavelength are absorbed by matter, then when we observe light reflected from or transmitted through that matter, what we see is the complementary color, made up of the other visible wavelengths remaining. For example, beta-carotene has maximum absorption at 454 nm (blue light), consequently what visible light remains appears orange .

== Colors by wavelength ==
What is seen by the eye is not the color absorbed, but the complementary color from the removal of the absorbed wavelengths. This spectral perspective was first noted in atomic spectroscopy.

Below is a rough table of wavelengths, colors and complementary colors. This utilizes the scientific CMY and RGB color wheels rather than the traditional RYB color wheel.

This can only be used as a very rough guide, for instance if a narrow range of wavelengths within the band is absorbed, then the blue and green receptors will be fully stimulated, making cyan, and the red receptor will be partially stimulated, diluting the cyan to a greyish hue.

== By category ==
The vast majority of simple inorganic (e.g. sodium chloride) and organic compounds (e.g. ethanol) are colorless. Transition metal compounds are often colored because of transitions of electrons between d-orbitals of different energy. (see Transition metal#Colored compounds). Organic compounds tend to be colored when there is extensive conjugation, causing the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO to decrease, bringing the absorption band from the UV to the visible region. Similarly, color is due to the energy absorbed by the compound, when an electron transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO. Lycopene is a classic example of a compound with extensive conjugation (11 conjugated double bonds), giving rise to an intense red color (lycopene is responsible for the color of tomatoes). Charge-transfer complexes tend to have very intense colors for different reasons.

== Examples ==
However, elemental colors will vary depending on what they are complexed with, often as well as their chemical state. An example with vanadium(III); VCl3 has a distinctive reddish hue, whilst V2O3 appears black.

=== Salts ===
Predicting the color of a compound can be extremely complicated. Some examples include:
* Cobalt chloride is pink or blue depending on the state of hydration (blue dry, pink with water) so it is used as a moisture indicator in silica gel.
* Zinc oxide is white, but at higher temperatures becomes yellow, returning to white as it cools.
=== Ions in flame ===


=== Gases ===
==== Bead tests ====

A variety of colors, often similar to the colors found in a flame test, are produced in a bead test, which is a qualitative test for determining metals. A platinum loop is moistened and dipped in a fine powder of the substance in question and borax. The loop with the adhered powders is then heated in a flame until it fuses and the color of the resulting bead observed.

<doc id="285486" wikidata="Q672521" url="?curid=285486" title="Rhombicosidodecahedron">
<text>In geometry, the Rhombicosidodecahedron is an Archimedean solid, one of thirteen convex isogonal nonprismatic solids constructed of two or more types of regular polygon faces.

It has a total of 62 faces: 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 regular pentagonal faces, with 60 vertices, and 120 edges.

==Names==

Johannes Kepler in &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot; (1618) named this polyhedron a &quot;rhombicosidodecahedron&quot;, being short for &quot;truncated icosidodecahedral rhombus&quot;, with &quot;icosidodecahedral rhombus&quot; being his name for a rhombic triacontahedron. There are different truncations of a rhombic triacontahedron into a topological rhombicosidodecahedron: Prominently its rectification (left), the one that creates the uniform solid (center), and the rectification of the dual icosidodecahedron (right), which is the core of the dual compound.

==Dimensions==
For a rhombicosidodecahedron with edge length &quot;a&quot;, its surface area and volume are:

:formula_1

==Geometric relations==
If you expand an icosidodecahedron by moving the faces away from the origin the right amount, without changing the orientation or size of the faces, and patch the square holes in the result, you get a rhombicosidodecahedron. Therefore, it has the same number of triangles as an icosahedron and the same number of pentagons as a dodecahedron, with a square for each edge of either.

Alternatively, if you expand each of five cubes by moving the faces away from the origin the right amount and rotating each of the five 72° around so they are equidistant from each other, without changing the orientation or size of the faces, and patch the pentagonal and triangular holes in the result, you get a rhombicosidodecahedron. Therefore, it has the same number of squares as five cubes.

Two clusters of faces of the bilunabirotunda, the &quot;lunes&quot; (each &quot;lune&quot; featuring two triangles adjacent to opposite sides of one square), can be aligned with a congruent patch of faces on the rhombicosidodecahedron. If two bilunabirotundae are aligned this way on opposite sides of the rhombicosidodecahedron, then a cube can be put between the bilunabirotundae at the very center of the rhombicosidodecahedron.

The rhombicosidodecahedron shares the vertex arrangement with the small stellated truncated dodecahedron, and with the uniform compounds of six or twelve pentagrammic prisms.

The Zometool kits for making geodesic domes and other polyhedra use slotted balls as connectors. The balls are &quot;expanded&quot; rhombicosidodecahedra, with the squares replaced by rectangles. The expansion is chosen so that the resulting rectangles are golden rectangles.

Twelve of the 92 Johnson solids are derived from the rhombicosidodecahedron, four of them by rotation of one or more pentagonal cupolae: the gyrate, parabigyrate, metabigyrate, and trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron. Eight more can be constructed by removing up to three cupolae, sometimes also rotating one or more of the other cupolae.

==Cartesian coordinates==
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a rhombicosidodecahedron with an edge length of 2 centered at the origin are all even permutations of:
:(±1, ±1, ±&quot;φ&quot;3),
:(±&quot;φ&quot;2, ±&quot;φ&quot;, ±2&quot;φ&quot;),
:(±(2+&quot;φ&quot;), 0, ±&quot;φ&quot;2),
where &quot;φ&quot; =  is the golden ratio. Therefore, the circumradius of this rhombicosidodecahedron is the common distance of these points from the origin, namely = for edge length 2. For unit edge length, R must be halved, giving 
:&quot;R&quot; = = ≈ 2.233.

== Orthogonal projections ==

The &quot;rhombicosidodecahedron&quot; has six special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and three types of faces: triangles, squares, and pentagons. The last two correspond to the A2 and H2 Coxeter planes.
==Spherical tiling==
The rhombicosidodecahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.
==Related polyhedra==

=== Symmetry mutations ===
This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of a sequence of cantellated polyhedra with vertex figure (3.4.n.4), which continues as tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These vertex-transitive figures have (*n32) reflectional symmetry.

===Johnson solids===
There are 12 related Johnson solids, 5 by diminishment, and 8 including gyrations:

===Vertex arrangement===
The rhombicosidodecahedron shares its vertex arrangement with three nonconvex uniform polyhedra: the small stellated truncated dodecahedron, the small dodecicosidodecahedron (having the triangular and pentagonal faces in common), and the small rhombidodecahedron (having the square faces in common).

It also shares its vertex arrangement with the uniform compounds of six or twelve pentagrammic prisms.

== Rhombicosidodecahedral graph ==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a rhombicosidodecahedral graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the rhombicosidodecahedron, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 60 vertices and 120 edges, and is a quartic graph Archimedean graph.

<text>LTU International Airways, usually shortened to LTU and legally incorporated as &quot;LTU Lufttransport-Unternehmen GmbH&quot;, was a German leisure airline headquartered in Düsseldorf. It operated medium and long-haul routes and maintained hubs in Düsseldorf, Munich and at Tegel Airport in Berlin. LTU was acquired by Air Berlin in 2007. Use of the LTU brand ceased in 2009, and LTU itself was dissolved by April 2011.

==History==

===Early years===
LTU was established in May 1955 as &quot;Lufttransport Union&quot; and started operations in Frankfurt. In 1956 it began operating charter flights. The initials &quot;LTU&quot; stand for the German phrase &quot;LuftTransport-Unternehmen&quot; which translates to &quot;air transport enterprise&quot;. LTU had been headquartered in Düsseldorf since 1961. Over the years, LTU became one of the biggest and most renowned German leisure airlines and operated worldwide charter flights from many German airports, but mainly from its traditional main hub at Düsseldorf.

In 1983, a new subsidiary based in Munich called LTS was founded, which had a similar livery, using blue instead of red. It was rebranded &quot;LTU Süd&quot; in 1987 and got a new livery closer to LTU&#x27;s red livery. In 1998 LTU Süd was dissolved and completely incorporated into LTU. LTU also operated sister companies in Spain (LTE, 1987 - 2001) and Austria (LTU Austria, 2004 - 2008). Its traditional red and white livery barely changed over the years, becoming a recognizable trademark in the German charter flight business.

LTU was featured in the 1983 music video for the Wham! song &quot;Club Tropicana&quot; featuring George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley as air crew members on holiday in Ibiza.

In 1991, LTU acquired four new McDonnell Douglas MD-11 becoming the first and only German passenger operator. They handed them over to Swissair in 1998.

By March 2007 the airline&#x27;s owners were Intro Verwaltungsgesellschaft (55%) and Marbach Beteiligung und Consulting (45%) and had 2,892 employees.

===Purchase by Air Berlin===
In March 2007, Air Berlin bought LTU for €140 million in cash, creating the fourth-largest airline group in Europe in terms of traffic. Combined, the airlines carried 22.1 million passengers in 2006. The purchase was aimed at adding long-haul operations and increasing market share at Düsseldorf Airport. LTU initially retained its name on its leisure routes, while routes to the United States and China immediately switched to Air Berlin branding.

In May 2007, LTU presented its new livery. It maintained the traditional red and white corporate colors, but refreshed the overall appearance with smoother lines and overall more white. The new design was first applied to LTU&#x27;s then new twelfth long-haul aircraft, an Airbus A330-200. This livery was later adapted to become the new Air Berlin design.

On 1 May 2007, LTU operated the first Arctic &amp; North Pole sightseeing flight from continental Europe in aviation history, a charter flight for &quot;Deutsche Polarflug&quot;. The flight took 12h 55m and the aircraft, an A330-200 took 283 passengers from Düsseldorf via Norway, Svalbard, to The North Pole, eastern Greenland and Iceland back to Düsseldorf. The flight was filmed for an episode of PilotsEYE.tv.

LTU opened a third long-haul base at Berlin Tegel Airport in October 2007, basing a single Airbus A330-200 there to operate flights to Bangkok, Punta Cana and Varadero.

=== Cessation ===
Air Berlin announced in 2008 that the trademark &quot;LTU&quot; would no longer be used. All flights were rebranded as Air Berlin. The last known flight under LTU callsign, but already in Air Berlin livery, was on 13 October 2009 from Montreal to Düsseldorf. As of April 2011, the LTU&#x27;s AOC had expired and the company itself was dissolved. On 27 October 2017, Air Berlin itself ceased operations.

==Fleet==
During its existence, LTU operated the following aircraft, including the fleet incorporated into Air Berlin by March 2007:

<doc id="285490" wikidata="Q7261828" url="?curid=285490" title="Pushout">
<text>A &quot;pushout&quot; is a student who leaves their school before graduation, through the encouragement of the school. A student who leaves of their own accord (e.g., to work or care for a child), rather than through the action of the school, is considered a school dropout. In typical use, the category of pushouts excludes students who have been formally expelled from school for violating rules (e.g., for being violent).

Students may be pushed out of school because their presence in the school creates difficulty in meeting some goal of the school. For example, in the case where funding for the school is dependent upon scholastic achievement of the students, if the school can get rid of low-performing students, average test scores on academic performance tests will go up, thus increasing funding. Schools may pushout truant students, who formally enroll in classes, but then refuse to attend.

In some low-performing schools in Chicago combined dropout/pushout rates have exceeded 25% in one year.

Adolescents are also pushed from schools because they present discipline problems. Within youth advocacy and activist communities, pushout is a term that recognizes the intersecting forces of oppression most commonly responsible for high school &quot;drop outs&quot; within marginalized communities of color, allowing for the responsibility to be placed on those forces, rather than the youth impacted by unequal education, economics, disciplinary actions, and racism.

<text>The Yuma Territorial Prison is a former prison located in Yuma, Arizona, United States, that opened on July 1, 1876, and shut down on September 15, 1909. It is one of the Yuma Crossing and Associated Sites on the National Register of Historic Places in the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. The site is now operated as a historical museum by Arizona State Parks system as Yuma Territorial Prison State Historic Park.

==History==
===Prison===
Opened under the auspices and authority of the recently organized Arizona Territory, the prison accepted its first inmate on July 1, 1876. For the next 33 years 3,069 prisoners, including 29 women, served sentences there for various crimes ranging from murder to polygamy. The territorial prison was under continuous construction and repairs with labor provided by the prisoners. In 1909, the last prisoner left the old territorial prison for the newly constructed Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence, Arizona, three years before the establishment of the State of Arizona in 1912. 

It was the third historic park in Arizona. The state historic park contains a graveyard where 104 of the prisoners are buried.

===High school===
After its previous building suffered a fire in 1909, Yuma Union High School briefly occupied many of the old prison buildings a year after the prison had closed and the prisoners were moved to Florence. Various classrooms were set up temporarily in the old cellblocks and the hospital was used as an assembly hall. Yuma Union High was situated here for four years from 1910 to 1914. After the school moved to their new replacement buildings campus at its current modern site of 400 South 6th Avenue, the city of Yuma requisitioned the extensive old stone prison complex for a city jail after 1915. 

===Notable inmates===
* Burt Alvord – Cochise County lawman and train robber
* Bill Downing – Train robber
* William J. Flake – Mormon pioneer imprisoned for violating the Edmunds Act
* Pearl Hart – stagecoach robber
* &quot;Buckskin Frank&quot; Leslie – gunfighter and killer of Billy Claiborne
* Ricardo Flores Magón – Mexican revolutionary, founder of the &quot;Partido Liberal Mexicano&quot;
* Pete Spence – outlaw involved in the Earp-Clanton feud

<text>CliffsNotes are a series of student study guides. The guides present and create literary and other works in pamphlet form or online. Detractors of the study guides claim they let students bypass reading the assigned literature. The company claims to promote the reading of the original work and does not view the study guides as a substitute for that reading.

== History ==
CliffsNotes was started by Nebraska native Clifton Hillegass in 1958. He was working at Nebraska Book Company of Lincoln, Nebraska, when he met Jack Cole, the co-owner of Coles, a Toronto book business. Coles published a series of Canadian study guides called Coles Notes, and sold Hillegass the U.S. rights to the guides.

Hillegass and his wife, Catherine, started the business in their basement at 511 Eastridge Drive in Lincoln, with sixteen William Shakespeare titles. In August 1958, they shipped their first batch of notes and by the end of that year had sold over 58,000 copies. Hillegass hired literature teachers to condense works of literature into concise summaries, commentaries, author biographies and character analyses. In the 1960s, as his own writers revised the summaries of Shakespearian plays, Hillegass eliminated the Cole&#x27;s Notes versions.

By 1964, sales reached one million Notes annually. CliffsNotes now exist for hundreds of works. The term &quot;Cliff&#x27;s Notes&quot; has become a proprietary eponym for similar products. 

IDG Books purchased CliffsNotes in 1998 for $14.2 million. John Wiley &amp; Sons acquired IDG Books (renamed Hungry Minds) in 2001. In 2011, CliffsNotes announced a joint venture with Mark Burnett, a TV producer, to create a series of 60-second video study guides of literary works. In 2012, CliffsNotes was acquired by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. In 2021, CliffsNotes was acquired by Course Hero.

Chiluba, a trade union leader, won the country&#x27;s multi-party presidential election in 1991 as the candidate of the Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD), defeating long-time President Kenneth Kaunda. He was re-elected in 1996. As he was unable to run for a third term in 2001, former Vice President Levy Mwanawasa instead ran as the MMD candidate and succeeded him. After leaving office, Chiluba was the subject of a long investigation and trial regarding alleged corruption; he was eventually acquitted in 2009.

==Early life==
Chiluba was born to Jacob Titus Chiluba Nkonde and Diana Kaimba and grew up in Luapula Province where he was born. He did his basic education at Mambilima Mbolo Special School and his secondary education at Kawambwa Boys Technical Secondary School in Kawambwa, where he was expelled in the second year for political activities. He became a bus conductor, and later a politician. He worked as a city councilor before becoming an accounts assistant at Atlas Copco. He later joined the National Union of Building.

==Personal life==
Chiluba and his second wife, former First Lady of Zambia Vera Tembo, with whom he had nine children, divorced in 2000 after 33 years of marriage. Tembo has gone on to pursue a political career of her own, becoming MMD Chairperson for Women&#x27;s Affairs, being elected to the Zambian Parliament, and becoming deputy Minister of the Environment in 2006. On 6 May 2002, Chiluba married his third wife, Regina Mwanza, the former chairperson of women&#x27;s affairs for the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), in Lusaka.

Chiluba&#x27;s personal appearance and dapper dress as well as his short stature (he stood 1.5 m (5 ft) tall) was commented on both by his supporters and opponents throughout his career. In connection with European corruption allegations against him in the late 2000s, it was revealed that a Swiss shop had produced over 100 pairs of size 6 shoes for him with two inch heels, many monogrammed.

His careful appearance and taste for fine suits became a trademark, and was noted during his corruption trial. Roy Clarke, writing in &quot;The Post&quot;, ran a recurring column which lampooned the President during his time in office as &quot;a vain, cross-dressing, high-heel wearing, adulterous, dwarf thief&quot;. Political opponents made reference to these charges and traits in their criticisms of Chiluba&#x27;s rule. Candidate Michael Sata, for instance, said &quot;Chiluba&#x27;s thinking is as tall as he is... We are not going to steal money, we are not going to plunder, we are not going to buy suits, we are not going to buy shoes. We are not going to give girls houses...&quot; Kaunda referred to Chiluba as the &quot;Four-foot Dwarf&quot; during Chiluba&#x27;s rise in opposition politics. Chiluba was acquitted of all corruption charges in August 2009. Chiluba had also been described by the BBC as &quot;a fervent born-again Christian [whose] private life was the subject of much gossip.&quot;

==Unions==
Chiluba went on to win the chairmanship of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). He and several leaders in ZCTU were detained in 1981 by President Kenneth Kaunda for calling a wildcat strike that paralyzed most of the Zambian economy. The union leaders were released after a judge ruled their detention as unconstitutional. In 1987, he successfully withstood challenge to his chairmanship of NUBEGW that would have put his ZCTU position in jeopardy.

==Politics==
In 1990, soon after UNIP gave up its monopoly on power, he helped form the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), and became its presidential candidate in the snap 1991 election called as part of the deal that ended one-party rule. Due in part to festering resentment at UNIP&#x27;s 25-year rule (including 17 years as the only legal party), Chiluba defeated Kaunda in a massive landslide, taking 75 percent of the vote to Kaunda&#x27;s 25 percent–the second-biggest margin of victory for a contested election in Zambian history. Chiluba took office on 2 November of that year. On 29 December 1991, he declared Zambia a Christian nation. This declaration was included in the 2016 Constitutional Amendment Bill which is part of the current Constitution of the Republic of Zambia. He won re-election to a second five-year term in 1996 despite a lawsuit questioning his birthplace and hence his eligibility for the post.

Chiluba attempted to deport Kaunda on the grounds that he was a Malawian. He amended the constitution in order to stop citizens with foreign parentage from standing for the presidency, aimed at disqualifying Kaunda. His attempt to deport Kaunda was unsuccessful as Kaunda&#x27;s Zambian citizenship was confirmed by the &quot;Lewanika and Others vs. Chiluba&quot; Supreme Court ruling in 2000.

Some candidates in the 1996 presidential elections challenged his eligibility on these grounds, claiming that he or his real father was born in Zaire. However, he was raised in the Copperbelt of Zambia and this contributed to his taking up of unionism.

In 1997 his government survived a coup attempt after which Chiluba immediately declared a state of emergency and began jailing, without charges, persons suspected of involvement in the coup. These included several Zambian politicians, including those from opposition parties and the country&#x27;s previous President, Kenneth Kaunda.

In late 2001, Chiluba divorced his second wife, Vera, with whom he had nine children, namely Helen, Miko, Hortensia, Castro, Chongo, Kaindu, Huldah, Frederick Jr and Verocia . With his first wife he had Tito and Nikombe.

He later married the MMD Women&#x27;s Chairperson, Regina Mwanza a divorcee.
Despite his party&#x27;s overwhelming majority in parliament, he failed to win support in his bid to amend the constitution allowing him to run for a third term. No member of parliament ever moved the motion in the house to amend the national constitution, the government never presented any paper on the matter nor was there any referendum to amend the national constitution. The third term debate was between different groups within and outside the MMD. Chiluba himself was quiet about it. He stepped down at the end of his term on 2 January 2002, and was replaced by Levy Mwanawasa, his one-time vice-president. Chiluba started out as a socialist, but accepted some economic reforms.

Chiluba can be said to have left both an economic and a political legacy. Economically he started the process of ending Zambia&#x27;s socialist command economy. He presided over various economic reforms. He worked closely with British Prime Minister John Major throughout the early 1990s to reduce Zambia&#x27;s debt. Major and Chiluba restructured Zambia&#x27;s debt to Britain which allowed Zambia to begin paying off debts to other foreign countries without their credit being negatively effected. This was considered the most successful debt restructuring Africa during the 1990s.

Chiluba opposed international economic institutions. His successor Levy Mwanawasa re-established relations with IMF and World Bank which had been abolished during Chiluba&#x27;s government. This view contradicts Chiluba&#x27;s economic reforms which included the Privatisation of Parastatals which he spearheaded with close cooperation with the World Bank and the IMF. Chiluba is also credited with kickstarting the privatisation of ZCCM (Zambia Consolidatited Copper Mines) in the late 1990s, the country&#x27;s crown jewel.

==Corruption==
After leaving office, Chiluba was a target of Mwanawasa&#x27;s campaign against corruption: in February 2003, he was charged along with his former intelligence chief, Xavier Chungu, and several former ministers and senior officials, with 168 counts of theft totalling more than $40m.

It was alleged that money was diverted from the Ministry of Finance into an account held at the London branch of the Zambia National Commercial Bank (Zanaco). Chiluba said the account was used by the country&#x27;s intelligence services to fund operations abroad. Investigators said it was a slush fund, used to meet Chiluba and Chungu&#x27;s private and personal expenses.

Most of the charges that were made against him were later dropped, but others remained. In addition, his wife Regina was arrested for receiving stolen goods.

In early 2006, Chiluba was flown to South Africa for medical attention for a heart condition. After resisting the government&#x27;s call for him to return to Zambia for what they termed as long-term treatment, he returned on 15 July.

On 4 May 2007 he was found guilty of stealing $46m (£23m) in a civil case by a UK court. London high court judge Peter Smith accused Chiluba of shamelessly defrauding his people and flaunting his wealth with an expensive wardrobe of &quot;stupendous proportions&quot;. He also castigated his lawyer, Iqbal Meer, saying &quot;I am satisfied that no honest solicitor in his position would have done what he did.&quot; His unquestioning acceptance of the money - transferred to a London bank account by the Zambian intelligence service - was &quot;classic blind eye dishonesty&quot;. An appeal against the ruling was allowed by the court of appeal in 2008. Large sections of Zambian society have however questioned Peter Smith&#x27;s credibility following reprimands and recusals by the British judiciary. Many have argued that the British Judge should have concentrated on cases pertaining to properties that were allegedly obtained by corrupt means in Britain and Europe rather than properties in Zambia. However, after offering Chiluba&#x27;s clothes to his family in 2016, the Anti-Corruption Commission later secured a judgement in the Supreme Court of Zambia where Chiluba&#x27;s estate (Tedworth Properties) was forfeited to the state after seizing it in 2002.

Chiluba, however, continued to plead innocence and refused to recognise the verdict of the Judge Peter Smith who he accused of having been bribed by the Mwanawasa government. It is yet to be seen what effect the civil ruling in the UK will have on the criminal proceedings in the Zambian courts. Chiluba indicated at the time that the judgement in the UK had rendered the criminal proceedings in Zambia academic by heavily prejudicing his case.

On 7 June, the amount, which Chiluba was ordered to repay, was increased to $58m, accounting for interest and legal costs. Several days later, Judge Smith ordered Chiluba to leave his home in Lusaka within two weeks because it was judged to have been bought with money stolen from the public.

Chiluba collapsed on 24 May 2007 due to heart trouble and was hospitalized. He was released from the hospital on 29 May, and on 30 May doctors judged him to be fit to stand trial on the embezzlement charges following an examination. On 31 May, a court ruled that his trial should proceed, although his lawyers argued that it should not due to his poor health. The judge rejected arguments from Chiluba&#x27;s lawyers and doctors that the former president is too sick to face prosecution over graft charges. On 27 July he was flown to South Africa to be treated for heart trouble; this had been approved by the government earlier in the month. He was scheduled to appear in court for his trial on 14 August, and he returned to Zambia on 11 August, saying in an interview that he was &quot;surviving on God&#x27;s will&quot;. His spokesman said that his illness made it uncertain whether he would appear in court; in July, it was ruled that, if necessary, Chiluba would participate in the trial through video or a judge would go to his home. On 14 August, Chiluba rejected the idea of participating in the trial through video, saying that it would be illegal.

After appearing briefly in court on 14 August, Chiluba was present for the resumption of trial proceedings on 15 August. Chiluba took breaks during the day for health reasons.

Chiluba&#x27;s wife Regina was arrested on 3 September for allegedly receiving money and property stolen by Chiluba during his time in office, despite having previously been released after the case against her had been dropped on 24 August. Chiluba and his wife protested the arrest.

In May 2008, the government announced that it had recovered nearly 60 million dollars in money and assets allegedly stolen during Chiluba&#x27;s presidency.

Having long suffered from health problems, Mwanawasa died later in 2008. Chiluba was acquitted on all charges on 17 August 2009. Scores of people packed the Lusaka Magistrates Court to hear Judge Jones Chinyama final judgement which concluded that Dr. Frederick Chiluba was not guilty of the corruption charges laid against him and hence was acquitted.

==Political stances after leaving office==
Chiluba&#x27;s relationship with President Mwanawasa and the MMD soured badly after he was charged with corruption. He backed Mwanawasa&#x27;s main opponent, Michael Sata, in the 2006 presidential election. After Mwanawasa&#x27;s death in 2008, Vice-president Rupiah Banda succeeded him and Chiluba&#x27;s fortunes improved markedly. Chiluba was acquitted in 2009—a decision that Sata alleged was &quot;engineered&quot; by Banda—and President Banda refused to allow the state to appeal the verdict or pursue the matter further. Chiluba announced in January 2010 that he was supporting Banda for re-election in 2011, while also criticising the main opposition leaders. Transparency International argued that Chiluba was endorsing Banda &quot;so that he can be guaranteed his freedom&quot;, and Sata was similarly critical: &quot;Chiluba will do anything possible to ensure that his friend remains in power.&quot;

==Death==
Chiluba died of a heart attack on 18 June 2011, shortly after midnight. His spokesman, Emmanuel Mwamba, announced his death. Mwamba stated that Chiluba had a normal day on 17 June, and even had time to meet some of his lawyers. He had later complained of stomach pains.

<text>The Fulda () is a river of Hesse and Lower Saxony, Germany. It is one of two headstreams of the Weser (the other one being the Werra). The Fulda is long.

The river arises at Wasserkuppe in the Rhön mountains in Hesse. From there it runs northeast, flanked by the Knüll mountains in the west and the Seulingswald in the east. Near Bebra it changes direction to the northwest.

After joining the Eder river it flows straight north until Kassel, then changes direction to the northeast, with the Kaufungen Forest east and the beginning of the Reinhardswald forest northwest. The north end of the river meets the Werra in Hannoversch Münden, Lower Saxony, where the Fulda and the Werra join to form the Weser river.

Cities along the Fulda include:
* Gersfeld
* Fulda
* Bad Hersfeld
* Bebra
* Rotenburg an der Fulda
* Melsungen
* Kassel

<doc id="285510" wikidata="Q7733" url="?curid=285510" title="New York City Subway">
<text>The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system in New York City serving the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. It is owned by the government of New York City and leased to the New York City Transit Authority, an affiliate agency of the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Opened on October 27, 1904, the New York City Subway is one of the world&#x27;s oldest public transit systems, one of the most-used, and the one with the most stations, with 472 stations in operation (423, if stations connected by transfers are counted as single stations).

The system has operated 24/7 service every day of the year throughout most of its history, barring emergencies and disasters. By annual ridership, the New York City Subway is the busiest rapid transit system in both the Western Hemisphere and the Western world, as well as the eleventh-busiest rapid transit rail system in the world. The subway carried unlinked, non-unique riders in . Daily ridership has been calculated since 1985; the record, over 6.2 million, was set on October 29, 2015.

The system is also one of the world&#x27;s longest. Overall, the system consists of of routes, comprising a total of of revenue track and a total of including non-revenue trackage. Of the system&#x27;s routes or &quot;services&quot; (which usually share track or &quot;lines&quot; with other services), -3 pass through Manhattan, the exceptions being the train, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Rockaway Park Shuttle. Large portions of the subway outside Manhattan are elevated, on embankments, or in open cuts, and a few stretches of track run at ground level; 40% of track is above ground. Many lines and stations have both express and local services. These lines have three or four tracks. Normally, the outer two are used by local trains, while the inner one or two are used by express trains.

, the New York City Subway&#x27;s budgetary burden for expenditures was $8.7 billion, supported by collection of fares, bridge tolls, and earmarked regional taxes and fees, as well as direct funding from state and local governments.

== History ==


Alfred Ely Beach built the first demonstration for an underground transit system in New York City in 1869 and opened it in February 1870. His Beach Pneumatic Transit only extended under Broadway in Lower Manhattan operating from Warren Street to Murray Street and exhibited his idea for an atmospheric railway as a subway. The tunnel was never extended for political and financial reasons. Today, no part of this line remains as the tunnel was completely within the limits of the present-day City Hall station under Broadway. The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped demonstrate the benefits of an underground transportation system. A plan for the construction of the subway was approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900. Even though the underground portions of the subway had yet to be built, several above-ground segments of the modern-day New York City Subway system were already in service by then. The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. The oldest right-of-way, which is part of the BMT West End Line near Coney Island Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road.

The first underground line of the subway opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City (which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line). The subway line, then called the &quot;Manhattan Main Line&quot;, ran from City Hall station northward under Lafayette Street (then named Elm Street) and Park Avenue (then named Fourth Avenue) before turning westward at 42nd Street. It then curved northward again at Times Square, continuing under Broadway before terminating at 145th Street station in Harlem. Its operation was leased to the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), and over 150,000 passengers paid the 5-cent fare ($ in dollars ) to ride it on the first day of operation.

By the late 1900s and early 1910s, the lines had been consolidated into two privately owned systems, the IRT and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT). The city built most of the lines and leased them to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932. This system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down but stayed within the core of the city due to its small startup capital. This required it to be run &#x27;at cost&#x27;, necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare of the time, or 10¢ ($ in dollars ).

In 1940, the city bought the two private systems. Some elevated lines ceased service immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but several connections were built between the IND and BMT. These now operate as one division, called the B Division. Since the former IRT tunnels are narrower, have sharper curves, and shorter station platforms, they cannot accommodate B Division cars, and the former IRT remains its own division, the A Division. Many passenger transfers between stations of all three former companies have been created, allowing the entire network to be treated as a single unit.

During the late 1940s, the system recorded high ridership, and on December 23, 1946, the system-wide record of 8,872,249 fares was set.

The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), a public authority presided by New York City, was created in 1953 to take over subway, bus, and streetcar operations from the city, and placed under control of the state-level Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968.

Organized in 1934 by transit workers of the BRT, IRT, and IND, the Transport Workers Union of America Local 100 remains the largest and most influential local of the labor unions. Since the union&#x27;s founding, there have been three union strikes over contract disputes with the MTA: 12 days in 1966, 11 days in 1980, and three days in 2005.

By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at an all-time low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and graffiti and crime were rampant. Maintenance was poor, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.
Entering the 21st century, progress continued despite several disasters. The September 11 attacks resulted in service disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan, particularly the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which ran directly underneath the World Trade Center. Sections of the tunnel, as well as the Cortlandt Street station, which was directly underneath the Twin Towers, were severely damaged. Rebuilding required the suspension of service on that line south of Chambers Street. Ten other nearby stations were closed for cleanup. By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. Except for Cortlandt Street, the rest reopened in September 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street. Cortlandt Street reopened in September 2018.

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded several underwater tunnels and other facilities near New York Harbor, as well as trackage over Jamaica Bay. The immediate damage was fixed within six months, but long-term resiliency and rehabilitation projects continued for several years. The recovery projects after the hurricane included the restoration of the new South Ferry station from 2012 to 2017; the full closure of the Montague Street Tunnel from 2013 to 2014; and the partial 14th Street Tunnel shutdown from 2019 to 2020. Annual ridership on the New York City Subway system, which totaled nearly 1.7 billion in 2019, declined dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic and did not surpass one billion again until 2022.

=== Construction methods ===

When the IRT subway debuted in 1904, the typical tunnel construction method was cut-and-cover. The street was torn up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic on the street above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.

Contractors in this type of construction faced many obstacles, both natural and human made. They had to deal with rock formations and groundwater, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.

This method worked well for digging soft dirt and gravel near the street surface. Tunnelling shields were required for deeper sections, such as the Harlem and East River tunnels, which used cast-iron tubes. Rock or concrete-lined tunnels were used on segments from 33rd to 42nd streets under Park Avenue; 116th to 120th Streets under Broadway; 145th to Dyckman Streets (Fort George) under Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue; and 96th Street and Broadway to Central Park North and Lenox Avenue.

About 40% of the subway system runs on surface or elevated tracks, including steel or cast-iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. , there are of elevated tracks. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of two lines in regular service are the 142nd Street and Myrtle Avenue junctions, whose tracks intersect at the same level, as well as the same-direction pairs of tracks on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line at Rogers Junction.

The 7,700 workers who built the original subway lines were mostly immigrants living in Manhattan.

More recent projects use tunnel boring machines, which increase the cost. However, they minimize disruption at street level and avoid already existing utilities. Examples of such projects include the extension of the IRT Flushing Line and the IND Second Avenue Line.

=== Expansion ===
Since the opening of the original New York City Subway line in 1904, multiple official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. One of the more expansive proposals was the &quot;IND Second System&quot;, part of a plan to construct new subway lines in addition to taking over existing subway lines and railroad rights-of-way. The most grandiose IND Second Subway plan, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated IND, and was to comprise almost of the current subway system. By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included within the plan, which was ultimately never carried out. Many different plans were proposed over the years of the subway&#x27;s existence, but expansion of the subway system mostly stopped during World War II.

Though most of the routes proposed over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the proposals for the Second Avenue Subway. Plans for new lines date back to the early 1910s, and expansion plans have been proposed during many years of the system&#x27;s existence.

After the IND Sixth Avenue Line was completed in 1940, the city went into great debt, and only 33 new stations have been added to the system since, nineteen of which were part of defunct railways that already existed. Five stations were on the abandoned New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, which was incorporated into the system in 1941 as the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. Fourteen more stations were on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), which opened in 1955. Two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were part of the Chrystie Street Connection, and opened in 1968; the Harlem–148th Street terminal opened that same year in an unrelated project.

Six were built as part of a 1968 plan: three on the Archer Avenue Lines, opened in 1988, and three on the 63rd Street Lines, opened in 1989. The new South Ferry station was built and connected to the existing Whitehall Street–South Ferry station in 2009. The one-stop 7 Subway Extension to the west side of Manhattan, consisting of the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, was opened in 2015, and three stations on the Second Avenue Subway on the Upper East Side were opened as part of Phase 1 of the line at the beginning of 2017.

== Lines and routes ==


Many rapid transit systems run relatively static routings, so that a train &quot;line&quot; is more or less synonymous with a train &quot;route&quot;. In New York City, routings change often, for various reasons. Within the nomenclature of the subway, the &quot;line&quot; describes the physical railroad track or series of tracks that a train &quot;route&quot; uses on its way from one terminal to another. &quot;Routes&quot; (also called &quot;services&quot;) are distinguished by a letter or a number and &quot;lines&quot; have names. Trains display their route designation.

There are train services in the subway system, including three short shuttles. Each route has a color and a local or express designation representing the Manhattan trunk line of the service. New York City residents seldom refer to services by color (e.g., &quot;blue line&quot; or &quot;green line&quot;) but out-of-towners and tourists often do.

The , , , , , , and trains are fully local and make all stops. The , , , , , , , , , , and trains have portions of express and local service. , , , and trains vary by direction, day, or time of day. The letter is used for three shuttle services: Franklin Avenue Shuttle, Rockaway Park Shuttle, and 42nd Street Shuttle.

Though the subway system operates on a 24-hour basis, during late night hours some of the designated routes do not run, run as a shorter route (often referred to as the &quot;shuttle train&quot; version of its full-length counterpart) or run with a different stopping pattern. These are usually indicated by smaller, secondary route signage on station platforms. Because there is no nightly system shutdown for maintenance, tracks and stations must be maintained while the system is operating. This work sometimes necessitates service changes during midday, overnight hours, and weekends.

When parts of lines are temporarily shut down for construction purposes, the transit authority can substitute free shuttle buses (using MTA Regional Bus Operations bus fleet) to replace the routes that would normally run on these lines. The Transit Authority announces planned service changes through its website, via placards that are posted on station and interior subway-car walls, and through its Twitter page.

=== Nomenclature ===

=== Subway map ===
Current official transit maps of the New York City Subway are based on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller, with minor tweaks happening to the map when more permanent changes occur.

Earlier diagrams of the subway, the first being produced in 1958, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.

A late night-only version of the map was introduced on January 30, 2012. On September 16, 2011, the MTA introduced a Vignelli-style interactive subway map, &quot;The Weekender&quot;, an online map that provides information about any planned work, from late Friday night to early Monday morning. In October 2020, the MTA launched a digital version of the map showing real-time service patterns and service changes, designed by Work &amp; Co.

Several privately produced schematics are available online or in printed form, such as those by Hagstrom Map.

== Stations ==


Out of the 472 stations, 470 are served 24 hours a day. Underground stations in the New York City Subway are typically accessed by staircases going down from street level. Many of these staircases are painted in a common shade of green, with slight or significant variations in design. Other stations have unique entrances reflective of their location or date of construction. Several station entrance stairs, for example, are built into adjacent buildings. Nearly all station entrances feature color-coded globe or square lamps signifying their status as an entrance. The current number of stations is smaller than the peak of the system. In addition to the demolition of former elevated lines, which collectively have resulted in the demolition of over a hundred stations, other closed stations and unused portions of existing stations remain in parts of the system.

=== Concourse ===
Many stations in the subway system have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having to cross the street before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In many older stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.

Upon entering a station, passengers may use station booths (formerly known as token booths) or vending machines to buy their fare, which is currently stored in a MetroCard or OMNY card. Each station has at least one booth, typically located at the busiest entrance. After swiping the card at a turnstile, customers enter the fare-controlled area of the station and continue to the platforms. Inside fare control are &quot;Off-Hours Waiting Areas&quot;, which consist of benches and are identified by a yellow sign.

=== Platforms ===
A typical subway station has waiting platforms ranging from long. Some are longer. Platforms of former commuter rail stations—such as those on the IND Rockaway Line, are even longer. With the many different lines in the system, one platform often serves more than one service. Passengers need to look at the overhead signs to see which trains stop there and when, and at the arriving train to identify it.

There are several common platform configurations. On a double track line, a station may have one center island platform used for trains in both directions, or two side platforms, one for each direction. For lines with three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side platforms and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for each direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some four-track lines with express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.

=== Accessibility ===
Since the majority of the system was built before 1990, the year the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into effect, many New York City Subway stations were not designed to be accessible to all. Since then, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA. (Most grade-level stations required little modification to meet ADA standards.) Many accessible stations have AutoGate access. In addition, the MTA identified &quot;key stations&quot;, high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated. Under plans from the MTA in 2016, the number of ADA accessible stations would go up to 144 by 2020. , there were ADA-accessible stations.

Over the years, the MTA has been involved in a number of lawsuits over the lack of accessibility in its stations. The Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association filed what may have been the first of these suits in 1979, based on state law. The lawsuits have relied on a number of different legal bases, but most have centered around the MTA&#x27;s failure to include accessibility as a part of its plans for remodeling various stations. , ADA-accessibility projects are expected to be started or completed at 51 stations as part of the 2020–2024 Capital Program. This would allow one of every two to four stations on every line to be accessible, so that all non-accessible stops would be a maximum of two stops from an accessible station.

In 2022, the MTA agreed in a settlement to make 95 percent of subway and Staten Island Railway stations accessible by 2055. By comparison, all but one of Boston&#x27;s MBTA subway stations are accessible, the Chicago &quot;L&quot; plans all stations to be accessible in the 2030s, the Toronto subway will be fully accessible by 2025, and Montreal Metro plans all stations to be accessible by 2038. Both the Boston and Chicago systems are as old or older than the New York City Subway, though each of these systems has fewer stations than the New York City Subway. Newer systems, such as the Washington Metro and Bay Area Rapid Transit, have been fully accessible from their opening in the 1970s.

== Rolling stock ==


In November 2016, the New York City Subway had cars on the roster.
A typical New York City Subway train consists of 8 to 11 cars, although shuttles can have as few as two, and the train can range from in length.

The system maintains two separate fleets of cars, one for the A Division routes and another for the B Division routes. A Division equipment is approximately wide and long, whereas B Division equipment is about wide and either or long. 75-foot cars cannot be used over the BMT Eastern Division in regular service due to tight turning radii on Eastern Division lines; the turning radii for curves on Eastern Division lines are as tight as .

Cars purchased by the City of New York since the inception of the IND and the other divisions beginning in 1948 are identified by the letter &quot;R&quot; followed by a number; e.g.: R32. This number is the contract number under which the cars were purchased. Cars with nearby contract numbers (e.g.: R1 through R9, or R26 through R29, or R143 through R179) may be relatively identical, despite being purchased under different contracts and possibly built by different manufacturers.

From 1999 to 2023, the R142, R142A, R143, R160, R179, R188 and R211 were placed into service. These cars are collectively known as New Technology Trains (NTTs) due to modern innovations such as information screens, recorded train announcements, and the ability to facilitate Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC).

As part of the 2017–2020 MTA Financial Plan, 600 subway cars will have electronic display signs installed to improve customer experience.

== Fares ==
Riders pay a single fare to enter the subway system and may transfer between trains at no extra cost until they exit via station turnstiles; the fare is a flat rate regardless of how far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must swipe their MetroCard or tap a contactless payment card or smartphone on an OMNY reader upon entering the subway system, but not a second time upon leaving.

, nearly all fares are paid by MetroCard or OMNY. As of August 2023, the base fare is $2.90. Fares can be paid with most credit or debit cards using the OMNY readers, with a reusable MetroCard, or with single-use tickets. The MTA offers 7-day and 30-day unlimited ride programs that can lower the effective per-ride fare significantly. Reduced fares are available for the elderly and people with disabilities.

Fares were stored in a money room at 370 Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn starting in 1951, when the building opened as a headquarters for the New York City Board of Transportation. The building is close to the lines of all three subway divisions (the IRT, BMT, and IND) and thus was a convenient location to collect fares, including tokens and cash, via money trains. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room in the basement of the building. The money trains were replaced by armored trucks in 2006.

=== MetroCard ===
In June 1993, a fare system called the MetroCard was introduced, which allows riders to use magnetic stripe cards that store the value equal to the amount paid to a subway station booth clerk or vending machine. The MetroCard was enhanced in 1997 to allow passengers to make free transfers between subways and buses within two hours and several MetroCard-only transfers between subway stations were added in 2001. With the addition of unlimited-ride MetroCards in 1998, the New York City Transit system was the last major transit system in the United States with the exception of BART in San Francisco to introduce passes for unlimited bus and rapid transit travel. , MetroCard is to be retired at an undetermined date.

=== OMNY ===
On October 23, 2017, it was announced that the MetroCard would be phased out and replaced by OMNY, a contactless fare payment system by San Diego-based Cubic Transportation Systems, with fare payment being made using Apple Pay, Google Pay, debit/credit cards with near-field communication technology, or radio-frequency identification cards. As of December 31, 2020, OMNY is available on all MTA buses and at all subway stations.

== Modernization ==
Since the late 20th century, the MTA has started several projects to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving block signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing sections of lines during weekday nights in 2012,
in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.

The MTA has also started some projects to improve passenger amenities. It added train arrival &quot;countdown clocks&quot; to most A Division stations (except on the IRT Flushing Line, serving the ) and the BMT Canarsie Line () by late 2011, allowing passengers on these routes to see train arrival times using real-time data. A similar countdown-clock project for the B Division and the Flushing Line was deferred until 2016, when a new Bluetooth-based clock system was tested successfully. Beginning in 2011, the MTA also started &quot;Help Point&quot; to aid with emergency calls or station agent assistance. The Help Point project was deemed successful, and the MTA subsequently installed Help Points in all stations. Interactive touchscreen &quot;On The Go! Travel Station&quot; kiosks, which give station advisories, itineraries, and timetables, were installed starting in 2011, with the program also being expanded after a successful pilot. Cellular phone and wireless data in stations, first installed in 2011 as part of yet another pilot program, was also expanded systemwide due to positive passenger feedback. Finally, credit-card trials at several subway stations in 2006 and 2010 led to proposals for contactless payment to replace the aging MetroCard.

== Safety and security ==
=== Signaling ===

Signaling has evolved during a century of operation, and MTA uses a mixture of old and new systems. Most routes use block signaling but a few routes are also being retrofitted with communications-based train control (CBTC), which would allow trains to run without train operator input.

==== Wayside block signaling ====
The system currently uses automatic block signaling with fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops to provide safe train operation across the whole system. The New York City Subway system has, for the most part, used block signaling since its first line opened, and many portions of the current signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s. These signals work by preventing trains from entering a &quot;block&quot; occupied by another train. Typically, the blocks are long. Red and green lights show whether a block is occupied or vacant. The train&#x27;s maximum speed will depend on how many blocks are open in front of it. The signals do not register a train&#x27;s speed, nor where in the block the train is located.

Subway trains are stopped mechanically at all signals showing &quot;stop&quot;. To make train stops safe and effective, wayside trippers must not be moved to trip (&quot;stop&quot;) position until the train has fully passed.

==== Communications-based train control ====
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began automating the subway by installing CBTC, which supplements rather than replaces the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate more closely together with lower headways. The BMT Canarsie Line, on which the runs, was chosen for pilot testing because it is a self-contained line that does not operate in conjunction with other lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system. The total cost of the project was $340 million.

After the success of the BMT Canarsie Line automation, the IRT Flushing Line, carrying the , was next chosen to get CBTC. Estimated to cost US$1.4 billion, the project was completed in November 2018. By 2018, CBTC was in the process of being installed on several other routes as well, particularly the IND Queens Boulevard Line () and IND Culver Line (). The total cost for the entire Queens Boulevard Line is estimated at over $900 million, and the Queens Boulevard CBTC project was completed in 2022. Funding for CBTC on the IND Eighth Avenue Line is also provided in the 2015–2019 capital plan, and the IND Crosstown Line and IND Fulton Street Line were also being equipped with CBTC . The widespread installation of CBTC includes retrofitting many newer subway cars and replacement of older cars.

Eventually, the MTA has plans to automate a much larger portion, using One Person Train Operation (OPTO) in conjunction with CBTC. At the current pace of installation, it would take 175 years for CBTC to be installed at a cost of $20 billion. The Flushing line operated at almost 30 trains an hour using the signal system installed when the line was built, but after the CBTC installation it became possible that an additional two trains per hour could be operated. In March 2018, New York City Transit Authority president Andy Byford announced a new plan for resignaling the subway with CBTC, which would only take 10 to 15 years, compared to the previous estimate of 40 years. This would cost $8 to $15 billion.

The New York City Subway uses a system known as Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) for dispatching and train routing on the A Division (the Flushing line and the trains used on the do not have ATS.) ATS allows dispatchers in the Operations Control Center (OCC) to see where trains are in real time, and whether each individual train is running early or late. Dispatchers can hold trains for connections, re-route trains, or short-turn trains to provide better service when a disruption causes delays.

=== Train accidents ===

Despite the signal system, there have been at least 64 major train accidents since 1918, when a train bound for South Ferry collided with two trains halted near Jackson Avenue on the IRT White Plains Road Line in the Bronx. Several accidents resulted when the train operator ran through red signals and rear-ended the subway train in front of it; this resulted from the signaling practice of &quot;keying by&quot;, which allowed train operators to bypass red signals. The deadliest accident, the Malbone Street Wreck, occurred on November 1, 1918, beneath the intersection of Flatbush Avenue, Ocean Avenue, and Malbone Street (the latter of which is now Empire Boulevard) near the Prospect Park station of the then-BRT Brighton Line in Brooklyn, killing 93 people. As a result of accidents, especially more recent ones such as the 1995 Williamsburg Bridge crash, timer signals were installed. These signals have resulted in reduced speeds across the system. Accidents such as derailments are also due to broken equipment, such as the rails and the train itself.

=== Passenger safety ===
==== Track safety and suicides ====
A portion of subway-related deaths in New York consists of suicides committed by jumping in front of an oncoming train. Between 1990 and 2003, 343 subway-related suicides were registered out of a citywide total of 7,394 (4.6%) and subway-related suicides increased by 30%, despite a decline in overall suicide numbers.

Due to increase in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program, with four systems installed and strategies instituted to eliminate the number of people hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station&#x27;s tracks were installed. The tests were successful enough that the 2015–2019 capital program included similar installations system-wide.

The MTA also expressed interest in starting a pilot program to install platform edge doors. Several planned stations in the New York City Subway may possibly feature platform screen doors, including at future stations such as those part of the Second Avenue Subway. In October 2017, it was announced that as part of a pilot program, the Third Avenue station would be refitted with platform screen doors during the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown in 2019–2020. The $30 million for the platform edge door pilot program was diverted to another project in 2018. Following a series of incidents, MTA announced another PSD pilot program at three stations in February 2022: the platform at Times Square; the platform at Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport; and the Third Avenue station. Numerous challenges come with platform doors. Some subway lines operate multiple subway car models, and their doors do not align. Many platforms are not strong enough to hold the additional weight of a platform barrier, thus requiring extensive renovations if they were to be installed.

==== Crime ====

Crime rates have varied, but there was a downward trend from the 1990s to 2014. To fight crime, various approaches have been used over the years, including an &quot;If You See Something, Say Something&quot; campaign and, starting in 2016, banning people who commit a crime in the subway system from entering the system for a certain length of time.

In July 1985, the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City published a study showing riders abandoning the subway, fearing the frequent robberies and generally bad circumstances. Crime rates in the subway and the city dropped in 1993, part of a larger citywide decrease in crime. Michael Bloomberg stated in a November 2004 press release: &quot;Today, the subway system is safer than it has been at any time since we started tabulating subway crime statistics nearly 40 years ago.&quot; Although ridership decreased by 40 percent from 2019 to 2022, the number of crimes in the system remained roughly the same, prompting riders to express concerns over increased crime. The subway recorded eight murders in 2021, the highest annual total in 25 years; by October 2022, nine people had been murdered that year alone.

The subway system has been the target of some mass attacks, though such attacks are relatively rare. On December 11, 2017, there was an attempted bombing at the Times Square–42nd Street station, injuring four people including the attacker. On April 12, 2022, a shooting attack occurred on the N train, injuring 29 people including 10 who were shot.

==== Photography ====
After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the MTA exercised extreme caution regarding anyone taking photographs or recording video inside the system and proposed banning all photography and recording in a meeting around June 2004. Due to strong response from both the public and from civil rights groups, the rule of conduct was dropped. In November 2004, the MTA again put this rule up for approval, but was again denied, though many police officers and transit workers still confront or harass people taking photographs or videos. On April 3, 2009, the NYPD issued a directive to officers stating that it is legal to take pictures within the subway system so long as it is not accompanied with suspicious activity.

, the MTA Rules of Conduct, Restricted Areas and Activities section states that anyone may take pictures or record videos, provided that they do not use any of three tools: lights, reflectors, or tripods. These three tools are permitted only by members of the press who have identification issued by the NYPD.

==== Terrorism prevention ====
On July 22, 2005, in response to bombings in London, the New York City Police Department introduced a new policy of randomly searching passengers&#x27; bags as they approached turnstiles. The NYPD claimed that no form of racial profiling would be conducted when these searches actually took place. The NYPD has come under fire from some groups that claim purely random searches without any form of threat assessment would be ineffectual. Donna Lieberman, executive director of the NYCLU, stated, &quot;This NYPD bag search policy is unprecedented, unlawful and ineffective. It is essential that police be aggressive in maintaining security in public transportation. But our very real concerns about terrorism do not justify the NYPD subjecting millions of innocent people to suspicionless searches in a way that does not identify any person seeking to engage in terrorist activity and is unlikely to have any meaningful deterrent effect on terrorist activity.&quot; The searches were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in &quot;MacWade v. Kelly&quot;.

On April 11, 2008, MTA received a Ferrara Fire Apparatus Hazardous Materials Response Truck, which went into service three days later. It will be used in the case of a chemical or bioterrorist attack.

Najibullah Zazi and others were arrested in September 2009 and pleaded guilty in 2010 to being part of an al-Qaeda plan to undertake suicide bombings on the New York City subway system.

== Challenges ==
=== 2009–2010 budget cuts ===
The MTA faced a budget deficit of US$1.2 billion in 2009. This resulted in fare increases (three times from 2008 to 2010) and service reductions (including the elimination of two part-time subway services, the and ). Several other routes were modified due to the deficit. The was made a full-time local in Manhattan (in contrast to being a weekend local/weekday express before 2010), while the was extended nine stations north to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard on weekdays, both to cover the discontinued . The was combined with the , routing it over the Chrystie Street Connection, IND Sixth Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills–71st Avenue on weekdays instead of via the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and BMT West End Line to Bay Parkway. The was truncated to Court Square full-time. Construction headways on eleven routes were lengthened, and off-peak service was lengthened on seven routes.

=== 2017–2021 state of emergency ===
In June 2017, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the New York City Subway after a series of derailments, track fires, and overcrowding incidents. On June 27, 2017, thirty-nine people were injured when an A train derailed at 125th Street, damaging tracks and signals then catching fire. On July 21, 2017, the second set of wheels on a southbound Q train jumped the track near Brighton Beach, with nine people suffering injuries due to improper maintenance of the car in question. To solve the system&#x27;s problems, the MTA officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge on June 28, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock.

On July 25, 2017, Chairman Joe Lhota announced a two-phase, $9 billion New York City Subway Action Plan to stabilize the subway system and to prevent the continuing decline of the system. The first phase, costing $836 million, consisted of five categories of improvements in Signal and Track Maintenance, Car Reliability, System Safety and Cleanliness, Customer Communication, and Critical Management Group. The $8 billion second phase would implement the winning proposals from the Genius Transit Challenge and fix more widespread problems. Six winning submissions for the Genius Transit Challenge were announced in March 2018.

In October 2017, city comptroller Scott Stringer released an analysis that subway delays could cost up to $389 million or $243.1 million or $170.2 million per year depending on the length of the delays. In November 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published its investigation into the crisis. It found that the crisis had arisen as a result of financially unsound decisions by local and state politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, these decisions included overspending; overpaying unions and interest groups; advertising superficial improvement projects while ignoring more important infrastructure; and agreeing to high-interest loans that would have been unnecessary without these politicians&#x27; other interventions. By this time, the subway&#x27;s 65% average on-time performance was the lowest among all major cities&#x27; transit systems, and every non-shuttle subway route&#x27;s on-time performance had declined in the previous ten years. The state of emergency ended on June 30, 2021, after previously being renewed 49 times. , on-time performance across all routes is at 80.6 percent. Worsening subway reliability and service cuts in the early 2020s have been attributed to chronic mismanagement at the agency and a botched restructuring plan that was implemented under former Governor Andrew Cuomo.

=== Capacity constraints ===

Several subway lines have reached their operational limits in terms of train frequency and passengers, according to data released by the Transit Authority. By 2007, the E, L, and all A Division services except the 42nd Street Shuttle were beyond capacity, as well as portions of the train. In April 2013, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that the system was more crowded than it had been in the previous 66 years. The subway reached a daily ridership of 6 million for 29 days in 2014, and was expected to record a similar ridership level for 55 days in 2015; by comparison, in 2013, daily ridership never reached 6 million. In particular, the express tracks of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line are noted for operating at full capacity during peak hours. The Long Island Rail Road East Side Access project, which opened in January 2023, was expected to bring many more commuters to the Lexington Avenue Line. The Second Avenue Subway was built to relieve pressure on the Lexington Avenue Line () by shifting an estimated 225,000 passengers. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020, there was enough of a ridership decrease that these routes were no longer crammed to capacity during rush hours, although they still experienced some crowding.

By early 2016, delays as a result of overcrowding were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be on the edge of the platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. The MTA is considering platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers falling onto the tracks. , platform screen doors were planned to be installed in three stations, following an increase in people being pushed onto the tracks.

==== Expanding service frequency via CBTC ====

The MTA has sought to relieve overcrowding by upgrading signaling systems on some lines to use communications-based train control. CBTC installation on the Flushing Line is expected to increase the rate of trains per hour on the , but little relief will come to other crowded lines until later. The , which is overcrowded during rush hours, already has CBTC operation. The installation of CBTC has reduced the L&#x27;s running time by 3%. Even with CBTC, there are limits on the potential increased service. For L service to be increased further, a power upgrade as well as additional space for the L to turn around at its Manhattan terminus, Eighth Avenue, are needed.

==== Service frequency and car capacity ====
Due to an increase of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. This increase is not likely to keep up with the growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.

As part of the R211 subway car order, the MTA is planning to test a train of 10 open-gangway experimental prototype cars, which could increase capacity by up to 10% by utilizing space between cars. The order could be expanded to include up to 750 open-gangway cars.

==== Platform crowd control ====
The MTA is also testing smaller ideas on some services. Starting in late 2015, 100 &quot;station platform controllers&quot; were deployed for the F, 6, and 7 trains, to manage the flow of passengers on and off crowded trains during morning rush hours. There were a total of 129 such employees, who also answer passengers&#x27; questions about subway directions, rather than having conductors answer them and thus delaying the trains. In early 2017, the test was expanded to the afternoon peak period with an increase of 35 platform conductors. In November of the same year, 140 platform controllers and 90 conductors gained iPhone 6S devices so they could receive notifications of, and tell riders about, subway disruptions. Subway guards, the predecessors to the platform controllers, were first used during the Great Depression and World War II.

Shortened &quot;next stop&quot; announcements on trains were being tested on the 2 and 5 trains. &quot;Step aside&quot; signs on the platforms, reminding boarding passengers to let departing passengers off the train first, were tested at Grand Central–42nd Street, 51st Street, and 86th Street on the Lexington Avenue Line. Cameras would also be installed so the MTA could observe passenger overcrowding.

In systems like the London Underground, stations are simply closed off when they are overcrowded; that type of restriction is not necessary yet on the New York City Subway, according to MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz.

=== Subway flooding ===

Service on the subway system is occasionally disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 million gallons of water when it is not raining. The pumps and drainage system can handle a rainfall rate of per hour. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.

Despite these improvements, the transit system continues to experience flooding problems. On August 8, 2007, after more than of rain fell within an hour, the subway system flooded, causing almost every subway service to either be disabled or seriously disrupted, effectively halting the morning rush. On September 1, 2021, when of rain per hour fell during Hurricane Ida, service on the entire subway system was suspended.

As part of a $130 million and an estimated 18-month project, the MTA began installing new subway grates in September 2008 in an attempt to prevent rain from overflowing into the subway system. The metallic structures, designed with the help of architectural firms and meant as a piece of public art, are placed atop existing grates but with a sleeve to prevent debris and rain from flooding the subway. The racks will at first be installed in the three most flood-prone areas as determined by hydrologists: Jamaica, Tribeca, and the Upper West Side. Each neighborhood has its own distinct design, some featuring a wave-like deck which increases in height and features seating (as in Jamaica), others with a flatter deck that includes seating and a bike rack.

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused significant damage to New York City, and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; some infrastructure needed years to repair. A year after the storm, MTA spokesperson Kevin Ortiz said, &quot;This was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.&quot; The storm flooded nine of the system&#x27;s 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines, and several subway yards, as well as completely destroying a portion of the IND Rockaway Line and much of the South Ferry terminal station. Reconstruction required many partial or total closures on several lines and tunnels. Heavy flooding also occurred in September 2021 during Hurricane Ida and in September 2023 during the aftermath of Tropical Storm Ophelia.

=== Full and partial subway closures ===

Before 2011 there have been some full subway closures for transit strikes (January 1–13, 1966, April 1–11, 1980, December 20–22, 2005) and blackouts (November 9–10, 1965, July 13–14, 1977, August 14–16, 2003).

On August 27, 2011, due to the approach of Hurricane Irene, the MTA suspended subway service at noon in anticipation of heavy flooding on tracks and in tunnels. It was the first weather-caused shutdown in the history of the system. Service was restored by August 29.

On October 29, 2012, a full closure was ordered before the arrival of Hurricane Sandy. All services on the subway, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North were gradually shut down by 7:00 P.M. to protect passengers, employees, and equipment from the coming storm. The storm caused serious damage to the system, especially the IND Rockaway Line, upon which many sections between Howard Beach–JFK Airport and Hammels Wye on the Rockaway Peninsula were heavily damaged, leaving it essentially isolated from the rest of the system. This required the NYCTA to truck in 20 R32 subway cars to the line to provide some interim service (temporarily designated the ). Also, several of the system&#x27;s tunnels under the East River were flooded by the storm surge. South Ferry suffered serious water damage and did not reopen until April 4, 2013, by restoring service to the older loop-configured station that had been replaced in 2009; the stub-end terminal tracks remained out of service until June 2017.

Since 2015, there have been several blizzard-related subway shutdowns. On January 26, 2015, another full closure was ordered by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo due to the January 2015 nor&#x27;easter, originally projected to leave New York City with of snow; this was the first shutdown in the system&#x27;s history to be ordered due to snow. The next day, the subway system was partially reopened. Several residents criticized the decision to shut down the subway system due to snow, as the nor&#x27;easter dropped much less snow in the city than originally expected, totaling only in Central Park. For subsequent snowstorms, the MTA published a winter underground-only subway service plan. When this plan is in effect, all above-ground stations would be closed and all above-ground service suspended, except at 125th Street and Broadway, where trains would run above ground but skip the station. Underground service would remain operational, except at a small number of stations that would be closed because of their proximity to above-ground portions of the system. This plan was first used on January 23, 2016, during the January 2016 United States blizzard; it was also used on March 14, 2017, due to the March 2017 nor&#x27;easter. On August 4, 2020, service at above-ground stations was suspended due to the high wind gusts brought by Tropical Storm Isaias.

Starting on May 6, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, stations were closed between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. for cleaning and disinfecting. Nevertheless, over 500 trains continued running every 20 minutes between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., carrying only transit workers and emergency personnel. The trains kept running because there was not enough space in the system to store all trains simultaneously, and also so that they could easily resume service upon the start of rush hour at 5 a.m. In February 2021, the overnight closures were shortened to between 2 and 4 a.m., and in May 2021, Cuomo announced that 24-hour service would resume on May 17. This was the longest shutdown in the subway&#x27;s history.

=== Litter and rodents ===

Litter accumulation in the subway system is perennial. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti, were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.

The New York City Subway system is infested with rats. Rats are sometimes seen on platforms, and are commonly seen foraging through garbage thrown onto the tracks. They are believed to pose a health hazard, and on rare instances have been known to bite humans. Subway stations notorious for rat infestation include Chambers Street, Jay Street–MetroTech, West Fourth Street, Spring Street and 145th Street.

Decades of efforts to eradicate or simply thin the rat population in the system have been a failure. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap designs. In October 2011, they announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their garbage rooms, of rat infestations. That same month, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative was tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their garbage cans removed due to the success of the program. In March 2017 the program was ended as a failure.

The old vacuum trains that are designed to remove trash from the tracks are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country based on the number of viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, an aggressive plan to dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment. This was expected to reduce track fires and train delays. As part of the plan, the frequency of station track cleaning would be increased, and 94 stations would be cleaned per two-week period, an increase from the previous rate of 34 stations every two weeks. The MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning on September 12, 2016. Several vacuum trains were delivered in 2018 and 2019. The operation planned to also include 27 new refuse cars.

=== Noise ===
Rolling stock on the New York City Subway produces high levels of noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University&#x27;s Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94 dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels for as little as 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100 dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4 dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4 dB), Metro-North (75.1 dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9 dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95 dB is 10 times more intense than at 85 dB, 100 times more intense than at 75 dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1 dB.

For the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change that is going to be made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.

== Public relations and cultural impact ==

=== Entertainment ===


The subway is a popular venue for busking. A permit is not required to perform, but certain codes of conduct are required. Some buskers are affiliated with Music Under New York (MUNY), a part of the Arts &amp; Design program by the MTA. Since 1987, MTA has sponsored the MUNY program in which street musicians enter a competitive contest to be assigned to the preferred high traffic locations. Each year, applications are reviewed and approximately 70 eligible performers are selected and contacted to participate in live auditions held for one day.

=== Miss Subways ===
From 1941 to 1976, the Board of Transportation/New York City Transit Authority sponsored the &quot;Miss Subways&quot; publicity campaign. In the musical &quot;On the Town&quot;, the character Miss Turnstiles is based on the Miss Subways campaign. The campaign was resurrected in 2004, for one year, as &quot;Ms. Subways&quot;. It was part of the 100th anniversary celebrations. The monthly campaign, which included the winners&#x27; photos and biographical blurbs on placards in subway cars, featured such winners as Mona Freeman and prominent New York City restaurateur Ellen Goodman. The winner of this contest was Caroline Sanchez-Bernat, an actress from Morningside Heights.

=== Subway Series ===
Subway Series is a term applied to any series of baseball games between New York City teams, as opposing teams can travel to compete merely by using the subway system. Subway Series is a term long used in New York, going back to series between the Brooklyn Dodgers or New York Giants and the New York Yankees in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, the term is used to describe the rivalry between the Yankees and the New York Mets. During the 2000 World Series, cars on the 4 train (which stopped at Yankee Stadium) were painted with Yankee colors, while cars on the 7 train (which stopped at Shea Stadium) had Mets colors.

=== Holiday Nostalgia Train ===

Since 2003, the MTA has operated a Holiday Nostalgia Train on Sundays in November and December, from the first Sunday after Thanksgiving to the Sunday before Christmas Day, except in 2011 and 2023, when the train operated on Saturdays instead of Sundays. This train is made of vintage cars from the R1–9 fleet, which have been preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and the New York Transit Museum. Until 2017, the train made all stops between Second Avenue in Manhattan and Queens Plaza in Queens via the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. In 2017, the train ran between Second Avenue and 96th Street via the newly opened Second Avenue Subway. Since 2018, the northern terminal is now located at 145th Street, except for 2024, which had its northern terminal at 96th Street–Second Avenue.

The contract, car numbers (and year built) used generally comprises R1 100 (built 1930), R1 103 (1930), R1 381 (1931), R4 401 (1932), R4 484 (1932) – Bulls Eye lighting and a test P.A. system added in 1946, R6-3 1000 (1935), R6-1 1300 (1937), R7A 1575 (1938) – rebuilt in 1947 as a prototype for the R10 subway car, and R9 1802 (1940).

=== Full train wraps ===
Since 2008, the MTA has tested full train wraps on 42nd Street Shuttle rolling stock. In full train wraps, advertising entirely covers the interiors and exteriors of the train, as opposed to other routes, whose stock generally only displays advertising on placards inside the train. While most advertisements are well received, a few advertisements have been controversial. Among the more contentious wraps that were withdrawn are a 2015 ad for the TV show &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, which featured a Nazi flag, and an ad for Fox Sports 1, in which a shuttle train and half of its seats were plastered with negative quotes about the New York Knicks, one of the city&#x27;s NBA teams.

Other routes have seen limited implementation of full train wraps. For instance, in 2010, one R142A train set on the 6 route was wrapped with a Target advertisement. In 2014, the Jaguar F-Type was advertised on train sets running on the F route. Some of these wraps have also been controversial, such as a Lane Bryant wrap in 2015 that displayed lingerie models on the exteriors of train cars.

=== LGBT Pride-themed trains and MetroCards ===
The New York City Subway system commemorates Pride Month in June with Pride-themed posters. The MTA celebrated Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019 in June 2019 with rainbow-themed Pride logos on the subway trains as well as Pride-themed MetroCards.

=== Guerrilla art ===

The New York City Subway system has been a target for unauthorized or &quot;guerrilla&quot; art since the 1970s, beginning with graffiti and tagging. Originally thought of as vandalism, the art form eventually emerged as an authoritative typology in the 1980s, especially with the release of the 1983 documentary &quot;Style Wars&quot;. Prominent pop-artist Keith Haring got his start tagging blank billboards on subway platforms with chalk art. In 2019–2020, the Bronx Museum mounted an exhibition of graffiti-tagged subway cars.

More contemporary installations have taken place as well. In 2014, artist London Kaye yarn-bombed the L train, wrapping metal hand poles in knit fabric. In 2019, artist Ian Callender used projectors to show accurate views of the cityscape above moving 6 trains on the ceilings of entire cars. In 2021, illustrator Devon Rodriguez went viral for his drawings of fellow commuters.

=== No Pants Ride ===

In 2002, the New York City Subway began hosting an event called the No Pants Subway Ride, where people ride the subway without their pants. The event is typically held each January but has not been held since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>In information technology and computer science, a system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of the system.

The set of states a system can occupy is known as its state space. In a discrete system, the state space is countable and often finite. The system&#x27;s internal behaviour or interaction with its environment consists of separately occurring individual actions or events, such as accepting input or producing output, that may or may not cause the system to change its state. Examples of such systems are digital logic circuits and components, automata and formal language, computer programs, and computers. 

The output of a digital circuit or deterministic computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and its state.

==Digital logic circuit state==
Digital logic circuits can be divided into two types: combinational logic, whose output signals are dependent only on its present input signals, and sequential logic, whose outputs are a function of both the current inputs and the past history of inputs. In sequential logic, information from past inputs is stored in electronic memory elements, such as flip-flops. The stored contents of these memory elements, at a given point in time, is collectively referred to as the circuit&#x27;s &quot;state&quot; and contains all the information about the past to which the circuit has access.

Since each binary memory element, such as a flip-flop, has only two possible states, &quot;one&quot; or &quot;zero&quot;, and there is a finite number of memory elements, a digital circuit has only a certain finite number of possible states. If N is the number of binary memory elements in the circuit, the maximum number of states a circuit can have is 2&quot;N&quot;.

==Program state==
Similarly, a computer program stores data in variables, which represent storage locations in the computer&#x27;s memory. The contents of these memory locations, at any given point in the program&#x27;s execution, are called the program&#x27;s &quot;state&quot;.

A more specialized definition of state is used for computer programs that operate serially or sequentially on streams of data, such as parsers, firewalls, communication protocols and encryption. Serial programs operate on the incoming data characters or packets sequentially, one at a time. In some of these programs, information about previous data characters or packets received is stored in variables and used to affect the processing of the current character or packet. This is called a stateful protocol and the data carried over from the previous processing cycle is called the &quot;state&quot;. In others, the program has no information about the previous data stream and starts fresh with each data input; this is called a stateless protocol.

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm (way of designing a programming language) that describes computation in terms of the program state, and of the statements which change the program state. Changes of state are implicit, managed by the program runtime, so that a subroutine has visibility of the changes of state made by other parts of the program, known as side effects.

In declarative programming languages, the program describes the desired results and doesn&#x27;t specify changes to the state directly.

In functional programming, state is usually represented with temporal logic as explicit variables that represent the program state at each step of a program execution: a state variable is passed as an input parameter of a state-transforming function, which returns the updated state as part of its return value. A pure functional subroutine only has visibility of changes of state represented by the state variables in its scope.

==Finite-state machines==
The output of a sequential circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and current state. Since each binary memory element has only two possible states, 0 or 1, the total number of different states a circuit can assume is finite, and fixed by the number of memory elements. If there are &quot;N&quot; binary memory elements, a digital circuit can have at most 2&quot;N&quot; distinct states. The concept of state is formalized in an abstract mathematical model of computation called a finite-state machine, used to design both sequential digital circuits and computer programs.

==Examples==
An example of an everyday device that has a state is a television set. To change the channel of a TV, the user usually presses a channel up or channel down button on the remote control, which sends a coded message to the set. In order to calculate the new channel that the user desires, the digital tuner in the television must have stored in it the number of the &quot;current channel&quot; it is on. It then adds one or subtracts one from this number to get the number for the new channel, and adjusts the TV to receive that channel. This new number is then stored as the &quot;current channel&quot;. Similarly, the television also stores a number that controls the level of volume produced by the speaker. Pressing the volume up or volume down buttons increments or decrements this number, setting a new level of volume. Both the &quot;current channel&quot; and &quot;current volume&quot; numbers are part of the TV&#x27;s state. They are stored in non-volatile memory, which preserves the information when the TV is turned off, so when it is turned on again the TV will return to its previous station and volume level.

As another example, the state of a microprocessor is the contents of all the memory elements in it: the accumulators, storage registers, data caches, and flags. When computers such as laptops go into hibernation mode to save energy by shutting down the processor, the state of the processor is stored on the computer&#x27;s hard disk, so it can be restored when the computer comes out of hibernation, and the processor can take up operations where it left off.

<text>The Ashvamedha () was a horse sacrifice ritual followed by the Śrauta tradition of Vedic religion. It was used by ancient Indian kings to prove their imperial sovereignty: a horse accompanied by the king&#x27;s warriors would be released to wander for a year. In the territory traversed by the horse, any rival could dispute the king&#x27;s authority by challenging the warriors accompanying it. After one year, if no enemy had managed to kill or capture the horse, the animal would be guided back to the king&#x27;s capital. It would be then sacrificed, and the king would be declared as an undisputed sovereign.

The ritual is recorded as being held by many ancient rulers, but apparently only by two in the last thousand years. The most recent ritual was in 1741, the second one held by Maharajah Jai Singh II of Jaipur.

The original Vedic religion had evidently included many animal sacrifices, as had the various folk religions of India. Brahminical Hinduism had evolved opposing animal sacrifices, which have not been the norm in most forms of Hinduism for many centuries. The great prestige and political role of the Ashvamedha perhaps kept it alive for longer.

==The sacrifice==
The Ashvamedha could only be conducted by a powerful victorious king (&quot;rājā&quot;). Its object was the acquisition of power and glory, the sovereignty over neighbouring provinces, seeking progeny and general prosperity of the kingdom. It was enormously expensive, requiring the participation of hundreds of individuals, many with specialized skills, and hundreds of animals, and involving many precisely prescribed rituals at every stage.

The horse to be sacrificed must be a white stallion with black spots. The preparations included the construction of a special &quot;sacrificial house&quot; and a fire altar. Before the horse began its travels, at a moment chosen by astrologers, there was a ceremony and small sacrifice in the house, after which the king had to spend the night with the queen, but avoiding sex.

The next day the horse was consecrated with more rituals, tethered to a post, and addressed as a god. It was sprinkled with water, and the Adhvaryu, the priest and the sacrificer whispered mantras into its ear. A &quot;four-eyed&quot; black dog was killed with a club made of Sidhraka wood, then passed under the horse, and dragged to the river from which the water sprinkled on the horse had come and set to flow south. The horse was then set loose towards the north-east, to roam around wherever it chose, for the period of one year, or half a year, according to some commentators. The horse was associated with the Sun, and its yearly course. If the horse wandered into neighbouring provinces hostile to the sacrificer, they were to be subjugated. The wandering horse was attended by a herd of a hundred geldings, and one or four hundred young kshatriya men, sons of princes or high court officials, charged with guarding the horse from all dangers and inconvenience, but never impeding or driving it.

The escort had to prevent the stallion from mating with any mares during its journey, and if he did, an oblation of milk was performed to Vāyu. If the horse became ill with injury, an oblation of pap to Pūṣan. If he became ill without injury, then an oblation of cake to Agni Vaiśvānara. If he was afflicted with eye disease, an oblation to Sūrya. If the horse drowned, an oblation was performed to Varuṇa. If the horse was lost, an oblation of cake, potsherd, and three other dishes to the deities of heaven and earth, along with an oblation of milk to Vāyu and pap to Sūrya. If the horse died, then another was selected and consecrated to replace it. During the absence of the horse, an uninterrupted series of ceremonies was performed in the sacrificer&#x27;s home. Every day, three Sāvitreṣṭi rites and one evening Dhṛtihoma would be conducted by the priests. In the evening after the Dhṛtihoma, two Brahmin and two Kshatriya bards and lutists would praise the patron king&#x27;s generosity, who gave 4,000 cows and 400 gold coins to the priests on the first day of the sacrifice. Then a session of pariplavākhyāna took place. The pariplāvana was the cyclical recitation of tales, in which one out of ten topics would be discussed each night, with 36 cycles of the ten topics. The tales were witnessed by an audience of onlookers called the upadrāṣṭṛ, who attended in their free time.

After the return of the horse, more ceremonies were performed for a month before the main sacrifice. Twelve days of dīkṣā rites took place, and then twelve days of upasad. The dīkṣā rite was a preparatory consecration rite performed before sacrifices. It consisted of a preliminary oblation, and then the king would bathe, dress in black antelope skin, and sit on another skin in a hut in front of a fire, fasting in silence with a covered head and sleeping on the ground. The upasad was a multiday ceremony that precedes Soma sacrifices. It consisted of the acquisition and welcoming of Soma and the construction of various structures needed for the sacrifice, along with the sacrifice of a goat.

On the twenty-fifth day, the agniṣṭoma was performed. The agniṣṭoma was the main part of the Soma sacrifice. In the morning pressing, the soma was pressed out and offered along with &quot;rice cakes, parched barley, flour in sour milk, parched rice, and a hot mixture of milk and sour milk&quot;. During the pressings and oblations, five musical chants were sung and five recitations were chanted. The priests then partook in the drinking of the soma and the twelve oblations to the seasons, and the sacrifice of a goat to Agni. The midday pressing was similar and dedicated to Indra, and dakshina was also distributed on that day to the priests consisting of a varying multitude of cows. At the evening pressing only two musical chants were sung and two recitations chanted. Then proceeded the conclusory libations to the &quot;yoking of the bay horses&quot; and the sun, followed by the Avabhṛtha. The Avabhṛtha was the &quot;unpurificatory&quot; bathing of the sacrificer at the end of the sacrifice. After an antelope skin was put in the water body, the king, his wife, and the priests ritually bathe. Afterwards a sterile cow or eleven other animals are sacrificed. Throughout the entire night, the annahoma was performed at the Uttaravedi (the northern altar). It consists of an oblation of clarified butter, fried rice, fried barley, and fried grain.

On the twenty-sixth day, the king was ritually purified, and the horse was yoked to a gilded chariot, together with three other horses, and Rigveda (RV) 1.6.1,2 (YajurVeda (YV) VSM 23.5,6) was recited. The horse was then driven into water and bathed. After this, it was anointed with &quot;ghee&quot; by the chief queen and two other royal consorts. The chief queen (mahiṣī) anointed the fore-quarters, the favorite wife (vāvātā) the middle, and the discarded wife (parvṛktī) the hindquarters. They also embellished the horse&#x27;s head, neck, and tail with golden ornaments and 101 or 109 pearls. After this, the horse, a hornless black-necked he-goat, and a Gomṛga were bound to sacrificial stakes near the fire, and seventeen other animals were attached with ropes to the horse. The he-goat dedicated to Agni was attached to the horse&#x27;s chest. A ewe dedicated to Sarasvatī was attached under the horse&#x27;s mouth. Two black-bellied he-goats dedicated to the Aśvins were tied to the horse&#x27;s front legs. A dark grey he-goat dedicated to Soma-Pūṣan was attached underneath the horse. On the two sides of the horse were attached a black goat to Sūrya and a white goat to Yama. Two goats with shaggy thighs were dedicated to Tvaṣṭar. A white goat dedicated to Vāyu was attached to the tail. A cow about to give birth was dedicated to Indra, and a dwarfish cow was dedicated to Viṣṇu. A great number of animals, both tame and wild, were tied to other stakes, according to one commentator, 609 in total. The sacrificer offered the horse the remains of the night&#x27;s oblation of grain. The horse was then suffocated to death.
The chief queen ritually called on the king&#x27;s fellow wives for pity. The queens walked around the dead horse reciting mantras and obscene dialogue with the priests. The chief queen then had to spend the night beside the dead horse in a position mimicking sexual intercourse and was covered with a blanket.

On the next morning, the priests raised the queen from the place. One priest cut the horse along the &quot;knife-paths&quot; while other priests started reciting the verses of Vedas, seeking healing and regeneration for the horse. The horse&#x27;s epiploon along with soma are offered in an oblation, and the priests dismember the horse and other animal victims with an oblation of their blood. On the third day an Atirātra was performed. The Atirātra was a Soma sacrifice in which there was a nocturnal session where soma was drunk. Afterwards an Avabhṛtha takes place. However, in the Ashvamedha sinners and criminals also take part in the purificatory bathing. Afterwards twenty-one sterile cows are sacrificed, and the dakshina was distributed to the priests. The main dakshina forms either the four wives of the king or their four hundred attendants.

The Laws of Manu refer to the Ashvamedha (V.53): &quot;The man who offers a horse-sacrifice every day for a hundred years, and the man who does not eat meat, the two of them reap the same fruit of good deeds.&quot;

== Mentions in Hindu epics ==

=== &quot;Mahabharata&quot; ===
The best-known text describing the sacrifice is the &quot;Ashvamedhika Parva&quot; (), or the &quot;Book of Horse Sacrifice,&quot; the fourteenth of eighteen books of the Indian epic poem &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Krishna and Vyasa advise King Yudhishthira to perform the sacrifice, which is described at great length. The book traditionally comprises two sections and 96 chapters. The critical edition has one sub-book and 92 chapters.
=== &quot;Ramayana&quot; ===
&quot;Balakanda&quot;, the first book of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; by Valmiki, mentions a horse sacrifice performed at the behest of King Dasharatha, the father of Rama.

==On Gupta coins==
One type of the gold coins of the Gupta Empire kings Samudragupta (reigned c. 350–370 CE) and Kumaragupta (reigned c. 415–455 CE) commemorates their Ashvamedha sacrifices. The obverse shows the horse anointed and decorated for sacrifice, standing in front of a &quot;Yūpa&quot; sacrificial post, and is inscribed &quot;The king of kings who has performed the Vajimedha sacrifice wins heaven after protecting the earth&quot;. The reverse shows a standing figure of the queen, holding a fan and a towel, and is inscribed &quot;Powerful enough to perform the Ashvamedha sacrifice&quot;.

==Similar sacrifices elsewhere==

Many Indo-European branches show evidence for horse sacrifice, and comparative mythology suggests that they derive from a Proto-Indo-European ritual. Most appear to be funerary practices associated with burial, but for some other cultures there is tentative evidence for rituals associated with kingship. The Ashvamedha is the clearest evidence preserved, but vestiges from Latin and Celtic traditions allow the reconstruction of a few common attributes.

A similar ritual is found in Celtic tradition in which the king in Ireland conducted a rite of symbolic marriage with a sacrificed horse. The Roman October Horse sacrifice was an annual event, and apparently the only time horses were sacrificed, rather than cattle or smaller animals.

Horse sacrifices were performed among the ancient Germans, Armenians, Iranians, Chinese, Greeks, among others.

== List of performers ==

Sanskrit epics and Puranas mention numerous legendary performances of the horse sacrifice. For example, according to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Emperor Bharata performed a hundred Ashvamedha ceremonies on the banks of Yamuna, three hundred on the banks of Sarasvati and four hundred on the banks of the Ganga. He again performed a thousand Ashvamedha on different locations and a hundred Rajasuya. Following the vast empires ruled by the Gupta and Chalukya dynasties, the practice of the sacrifice diminished remarkably.

The historical performers of Ashvamedha include:

The Udayendiram inscription of the 8th-century Pallava king Nandivarman II (alias Pallavamalla) states that his general Udayachandra defeated the Nishada ruler Prithvivyaghra, who, &quot;desiring to become very powerful, was running after the horse of the Ashvamedha&quot;. The inscription does not clarify which king initiated this Ashvamedha campaign. Historian N. Venkataramanayya theorized that Prithvivyaghra was a feudatory ruler, who unsuccessfully tried to challenge Nandivarman&#x27;s Ashvamedha campaign. However, historian Dineshchandra Sircar notes that no other inscriptions of Nandivarman or his descendants mention his performance of Ashvamedha; therefore, it is more likely that the Ashvamedha campaign was initiated by Prithvivyaghra (or his overlord), and Nandivarman&#x27;s general foiled it.

==In Hindu revivalism==

In the Arya Samaj reform movement of Dayananda Sarasvati, the Ashvamedha is considered an allegory or a ritual to get connected to the &quot;Inner Sun&quot; (Prana) According to Dayananda, no horse was actually to be slaughtered in the ritual as per the Yajurveda. Following Dayananda, the Arya Samaj disputes the very existence of the pre-Vedantic ritual; thus Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati claims that

He argues that the animals listed as sacrificial victims are just as symbolic as the list of human victims listed in the Purushamedha (which is generally accepted as a purely symbolic sacrifice already in Rigvedic times).

Gayatri Pariwar since 1991 has organized performances of a &quot;modern version&quot; of the Ashvamedha where a statue is used in place of a real horse, according to Hinduism Today with a million participants in Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh on April 16 to 20, 1994. Such modern performances are Sattvika Yajnas where the animal is worshipped without killing it, the religious motivation being prayer for overcoming enemies, the facilitation of child welfare and development, and clearance of debt, entirely within the allegorical interpretation of the ritual, and with no actual sacrifice of any animal.

==Reception==
The earliest recorded criticism of the ritual comes from the Cārvāka, an atheistic school of Indian philosophy that assumed various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. A quotation of the Cārvāka from Madhavacharya&#x27;s Sarva-Darsana-Sangraha states: &quot;The three authors of the Vedas were buffoons, knaves, and demons. All the well-known formulae of the pandits, jarphari, turphari, etc. and all the obscene rites for the queen commanded in Ashvamedha, these were invented by buffoons, and so all the various kinds of presents to the priests, while the eating of flesh was similarly commanded by night-prowling demons.&quot;

According to some writers, ashvamedha is a forbidden rite for &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, the current age.

This part of the ritual offended the Dalit reformer and framer of the Indian constitution B. R. Ambedkar and is frequently mentioned in his writings as an example of the perceived degradation of Brahmanical culture.

Scholar Manohar L. Varadpande, praised the ritual as &quot;social occasions of great magnitude&quot;. Rick F. Talbott writes that &quot;Mircea Eliade treated the Ashvamedha as a rite having a cosmogonic structure which both regenerated the entire cosmos and reestablished every social order during its performance.&quot;

<text>The Act for the Naturalization of the Most Excellent Princess Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of Hanover, and the Issue of her Body was an Act of the Parliament of England (4 &amp; 5 Ann. c. 16) in 1705. It followed the Act of Settlement 1701, whereby Dowager Electress Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant descendants were declared to be in the line of succession to the throne (her son George I later became king).

Sophia, a granddaughter of James VI of Scotland and I of England, was not considered to be an Englishwoman as she had not been born in England. This Act naturalized her and &quot;the issue of her body&quot;, provided they were not Catholic, as English subjects. Any person born to a descendant of Sophia could also claim to be the &quot;issue of her body&quot;.

In 1947, Prince Frederick of Prussia succeeded in a claim under the Act, having renounced his German citizenship.

The Act was repealed by the British Nationality Act 1948. However, any non-Catholic descendant of the Electress born before the repealing statute was enacted had already automatically acquired the status of a British subject, so there are still people alive who can claim British nationality under the Sophia Naturalization Act.

This was first tested between 1955 and 1957 when Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover successfully claimed British nationality on this basis after considerable litigation. 
As he was born and was a Protestant while the Act was in force, the courts recognized that he had already acquired citizenship, which the repeal of the statute did not affect. Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia was also given British citizenship using the Sophia Naturalization Act.

In the present time, however, most people likely to successfully claim citizenship in this manner would obtain the status of British Overseas citizen.

<doc id="285522" wikidata="Q644139" url="?curid=285522" title="Superheating">
<text>In thermodynamics, superheating (sometimes referred to as boiling retardation, or boiling delay) is the phenomenon in which a liquid is heated to a temperature higher than its boiling point, without boiling. This is a so-called &quot;metastable state&quot; or &quot;metastate&quot;, where boiling might occur at any time, induced by external or internal effects. Superheating is achieved by heating a homogeneous substance in a clean container, free of nucleation sites, while taking care not to disturb the liquid. 

This may occur by microwaving water in a very smooth container. Disturbing the water may cause an unsafe eruption of hot water and result in burns.

== Cause ==
Water is said to &quot;boil&quot; when bubbles of water vapor grow without bound, bursting at the surface. For a vapor bubble to expand, the temperature must be high enough that the vapor pressure exceeds the ambient pressure (the atmospheric pressure, primarily). Below that temperature, a water vapor bubble will shrink and vanish.

Superheating is an exception to this simple rule; a liquid is sometimes observed not to boil even though its vapor pressure does exceed the ambient pressure. The cause is an additional force, the surface tension, which suppresses the growth of bubbles.

Surface tension makes the bubble act like an elastic balloon. The pressure inside is raised slightly by the &quot;skin&quot; attempting to contract. For the bubble to expand, the temperature must be raised slightly above the boiling point to generate enough vapor pressure to overcome both surface tension and ambient pressure.

What makes superheating so explosive is that a larger bubble is easier to inflate than a small one; just as when blowing up a balloon, the hardest part is getting started. It turns out the excess pressure formula_1 due to surface tension is inversely proportional to the diameter formula_2 of the bubble. That is, formula_3. 

This can be derived by imagining a plane cutting a bubble into two halves. Each half is pulled towards the middle with a surface tension force formula_4, which must be balanced by the force from excess pressure formula_5. So we obtain formula_6, which simplifies to formula_3.

This means if the largest bubbles in a container are small, only a few micrometres in diameter, overcoming the surface tension may require a large formula_1, requiring exceeding the boiling point by several degrees Celsius. Once a bubble does begin to grow, the surface tension pressure decreases, so it expands explosively in a positive feedback loop. In practice, most containers have scratches or other imperfections which trap pockets of air that provide starting bubbles, and impure water containing small particles can also trap air pockets. Only a smooth container of purified liquid can reliably superheat.

==Occurrence via microwave oven==
Superheating can occur when an undisturbed container of water is heated in a microwave oven. At the time the container is removed, the lack of nucleation sites prevents boiling, leaving the surface calm. However, once the water is disturbed, some of it violently flashes to steam, potentially spraying boiling water out of the container. The boiling can be triggered by jostling the cup, inserting a stirring device, or adding a substance like instant coffee or sugar. The chance of superheating is greater with smooth containers, because scratches or chips can house small pockets of air, which serve as nucleation points. Superheating is more likely after repeated heating and cooling cycles of an undisturbed container, as when a forgotten coffee cup is re-heated without being removed from a microwave oven. This is due to heating cycles releasing dissolved gases such as oxygen and nitrogen from the solvent. There are ways to prevent superheating in a microwave oven, such as putting a spoon or stir stick into the container beforehand or using a scratched container. To avoid a dangerous sudden boiling, it is recommended not to microwave water for an excessive amount of time.

== Applications ==
Superheating of hydrogen liquid is used in bubble chambers.

<doc id="285524" wikidata="Q362113" url="?curid=285524" title="William Adelin">
<text>William Ætheling(, ; 5 August 1103 – 25 November 1120), commonly called Adelin (sometimes &quot;Adelinus&quot;, &quot;Adelingus&quot;, &quot;A(u)delin&quot; or other Latinised Norman-French variants of &quot;Ætheling&quot;) was the son of Henry I of England by his wife Matilda of Scotland, and was thus heir apparent to the English throne. His early death without issue caused a succession crisis, now known in English history as the Anarchy.

==Early life==
William was born in Winchester. His father, King Henry I of England, had married his mother, Matilda of Scotland, to conciliate his English subjects. Matilda was descended from Edmund Ironside and was a great-niece of Edward the Confessor; as such, the marriage represented a union between the new Norman rulers of England and the old Anglo-Saxon dynasty.

Henry&#x27;s hopes for his succession rested upon William, who was, according to Henry of Huntingdon, &quot;a prince so pampered&quot; that he seemed &quot;destined to be food for the fire.&quot;

==Duke of Normandy==
During Henry I&#x27;s lifetime, William was invested as Duke of Normandy, a title he held more in name than in practice. Henry made the investiture when he was pressed by the king of France, Louis VI, to do homage as Duke of Normandy. As a king in his own right, Henry was loath to comply, and in 1115 he offered to have William do this in his stead. This offer was eventually accepted in 1120, after an intervening period of war, and William did homage to Louis VI in the middle of 1120. For this reason William is sometimes counted as Duke of Normandy (as either William III or William IV). William received, as the heir to the throne, the homage and fealty of the barons of Normandy in 1115 and of the barons of England in March 1116.

William&#x27;s mother Queen Matilda served as Henry&#x27;s regent in England while he was away in Normandy. After her death in 1118 William was old enough to serve in her stead. He was closely advised in this role by the King&#x27;s administrators, such as Roger of Salisbury. During the last year or so of his life he was sometimes referred to as &quot;rex designatus&quot; (king designate).

During his 35-year reign Henry I of England faced several eruptions of hostilities due to the alliances of rival regions with some of his neighbours. To secure the loyalty of Anjou, a long-time rival of Normandy, Henry betrothed William to Matilda of Anjou, eldest daughter of Count Fulk V of Anjou in February 1113 near Alençon. Their marriage took place in June 1119 in Lisieux.

==Death==

William died in the &quot;White Ship&quot; tragedy of 25 November 1120. The Duke and his companions had been crossing the English Channel from Barfleur in the &quot;Blanche-Nef&quot;, the swiftest and most modern ship in the royal fleet. William and his party had remained drinking on the shore until after dark, confident that in a fast ship and on the still sea the delay would have no real effect. Consequently, it was the middle of the night when the drunken helmsman, captained by Thomas FitzStephen, rammed the ship into a rock in the bay.

The crew and passengers could not lever the ship off the rock, or prevent the ship from filling with water. William and several of his friends managed to launch a life-dinghy. At the last minute, William dashed back to rescue his illegitimate half-sister, Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche. When they and several others threw themselves into the small dinghy, it, &quot;overcharged by the multitude that leapt into her, capsized and sank and buried all indiscriminately in the deep.&quot;

Henry of Huntingdon, speaking of the disaster, wrote that William, &quot;instead of wearing embroidered robes…floated naked in the waves, and instead of ascending a lofty throne…found his grave at the bottom of the sea.&quot; William&#x27;s wife, Matilda, was on another ship at the time of the wreck. William&#x27;s death left the succession to his father uncertain. After King Henry died in 1135, William&#x27;s sister Empress Matilda and cousin Stephen of Blois waged a long war for the English throne in what is known as The Anarchy.

<doc id="285525" wikidata="Q535987" url="?curid=285525" title="Francis, Duke of Teck">
<text>Francis, Duke of Teck (Francis Paul Charles Louis Alexander; 28 August 1837 – 21 January 1900), known as Count Francis von Hohenstein until 1863, was an Austrian-born nobleman who married into the British royal family. His wife, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, was a first cousin of Queen Victoria. He was the father of Queen Mary, the consort of King George V. Francis held the Austrian title of Count of Hohenstein (&quot;Graf von Hohenstein&quot;), and the German titles of Prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;) and later Duke of Teck (&quot;Herzog von Teck&quot;), and was given the style of Serene Highness in 1863. He was granted the British style of Highness in 1887.

==Background and early military career==
Francis was born on 28 August 1837 in Esseg, Slavonia (now Osijek, Croatia), and christened &quot;Franz Paul Karl Ludwig Alexander&quot;. His father was Duke Alexander of Württemberg, the son of Duke Louis of Württemberg. His mother was Hungarian Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde. The marriage was morganatic, meaning that Francis had no succession rights to the Kingdom of Württemberg. His title at birth was Count Francis von Hohenstein, after his mother was created Countess von Hohenstein in her own right by Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria.

He was educated at the Imperial and Royal Technical Military Academy from 1849 to 1853 and joined the Imperial Austrian Army as a lieutenant in the 1st Lancers in 1854. He transferred to the Guard Squadron in 1858 and later became a Captain (&quot;Rittmeister&quot;) in the 7th Hussars. He served as Orderly Officer under Count von Wimpffen in Italy during the Austro-Sardinian War and was awarded the gold medal for distinguished service at the Battle of Solferino and the bronze war medal, 1859.

In 1863, Francis was created Prince of Teck, with the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, in the Kingdom of Württemberg. He served during the Austro-Prussian War and retired from the Austrian Army when he married and moved to England in 1866.

==Marriage and dukedom==

As the product of a morganatic marriage, and without succession rights to the throne, Francis was not acceptable as a husband for princesses in most of the European royal houses. Further, Francis had little income in comparison with other European princes. He thus married into a richer family, by marrying his father&#x27;s third cousin (in descent from George II of Great Britain) Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, the younger daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the 7th and youngest son of King George III.

The couple married on 12 June 1866 at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew, in Surrey. They had one daughter and three sons:

*Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (1867–1953); later Queen Mary, consort of King George V of the United Kingdom.
*Prince Adolphus of Teck (1868–1927); later Duke of Teck and Marquess of Cambridge.
*Prince Francis of Teck (1870–1910).
*Prince Alexander of Teck (1874–1957); later Earl of Athlone.

He was created Duke of Teck by the King of Württemberg in 1871.

==Later military career==
Teck was made Honorary Colonel of the 1st Surrey Artillery Volunteers on 15 June 1867 and continued as supernumerary Honorary Colonel of the 1st City of London Artillery after the units merged in 1883. He was also made Honorary Colonel of the 49th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers (Post Office Rifles) on 16 August 1876.

He was attached to the staff of British General Sir Garnet Wolseley during the Egyptian campaign of 1882. He received the silver medal for the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the Khedive&#x27;s Star, and the Order of Osmanieh, first class. On his return from Egypt he was gazetted a Colonel in the British Army.

The Duke of Teck was made Colonel (&quot;Oberst&quot;) à la suite of the 25th (1st Württemberg) Dragoons &quot;Queen Olga&quot; on 6 March 1889, and a &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in the Imperial German Army on 18 October 1891. He was made a supernumerary Major-General in the British Army in July 1893 and a &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; in the German Army on 18 April 1895.

Because Francis had no inheritance, the couple lived on Mary Adelaide&#x27;s Parliamentary allowance of £5,000 per annum (equivalent to ca. £525,000 in 2013), supplemented by income from her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge. Mary Adelaide&#x27;s requests to her cousin, Queen Victoria, for more funds were met with refusal; however, they were granted a grace-and-favour apartment in Kensington Palace, London, and a country house, White Lodge, the former Royal deer-hunting lodge in Richmond Park, Southwest London.

The Duke and Duchess lived beyond their means, leading to the build-up of large debts. In 1883, the Tecks fled the UK to continental Europe, where they stayed with relatives in Florence and Germany. They eventually returned to the UK in 1885.

==Later life==
With an Order in Council on 1 July 1887, Queen Victoria granted Francis the style of &quot;Highness&quot;, as a gift to celebrate her Golden Jubilee. Despite this, the Tecks were still seen as minor relatives, with little status or wealth. Their fortunes improved when their only daughter, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (known as &quot;May&quot; to her family) became engaged to the second-in-line to the British throne, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale. There was initial opposition to the match from the Duke of Clarence&#x27;s parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Arthur Balfour wrote to Lord Salisbury in 1890 that &quot;(t)he Teck girl they won&#x27;t have because they hate Teck and because the vision of Princess Mary haunting Marlborough House makes the Prince of Wales ill.&quot; Nevertheless, the Queen gave her official consent to the engagement on 12 December 1891. The death of the Duke of Clarence only six weeks later was a cruel blow. However, Princess May consented when the Duke of Clarence&#x27;s brother (and next in the line of succession), Prince George, Duke of York, proposed to her instead.

In 1897, the Duchess of Teck died, leaving Francis a widower. He continued to live at White Lodge, Richmond, but did not carry out any royal duties.

In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, the Duke of Teck listed his recreations as &quot;a little of all&quot;. He was President of the Royal Botanic Society and a member of numerous clubs, including White&#x27;s, the Marlborough Club, the Bachelors&#x27; Club, the Army and Navy Club, the United Service Club, the Cavalry Club, the Naval and Military Club, the Travellers Club, The Hurlingham Club, the Ranelagh Club, and the Jockey Club, as well as the Adels-Casino in Vienna and the Herren-Casino in Stuttgart.

The Duke of Teck died on 21 January 1900 at White Lodge. He was buried next to his wife in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

There is a pub in Earls Court, London, called the Prince of Teck.

<text>Toronto Rocks was an hour-long television program presenting music videos on CITY-TV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the 1980s, starting in 1984. It aired live at 4PM weekdays and was initially hosted by John Majhor. Majhor was a longtime DJ at 1050 CHUM AM in Toronto and eventually became one of Canada&#x27;s first &quot;VJs&quot; with the development of music videos. &quot;Toronto Rocks&quot; was a local contemporary to MuchMusic and MTV (CITY-TV and MuchMusic were both owned by CHUM Ltd.), and had kids rushing home from school every day to catch their favourite videos of the early-to-mid &#x27;80&#x27;s. During the show, Majhor played videos by a wide variety of the big-name artists of the day, all the way from Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Beat It&quot;, Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot;, Yes&#x27; &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, to the Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; and other songs released in the 1980s by artists who became commercially popular during the decade. Wednesdays on the show were set aside for &quot;Mid Week Metal Mania&quot;, where Majhor played only heavy metal videos from the hard rock and &quot;hair bands&quot; of the day. He also interviewed in-studio guests and had various contests and giveaways. Over 400 episodes of &quot;Toronto Rocks&quot; were aired.

Brad Giffen (until 1988), Lance Chilton (1988–90) and JD Roberts also filled in for John Majhor from time to time.

<doc id="285532" wikidata="Q2479291" url="?curid=285532" title="Moogle">
<text>are a fictional species of diminutive, sentient creatures and a recurring element of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game franchise, starting with their initial appearance in &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;. They also appear in the &quot;Mana&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series. Moogles serve a variety of purposes in the various games in which they appear. They sometimes provide opportunities to record game progress or access shops; occasionally they assist in battle or may even become a playable character.

Moogles became a popular character amongst fans and critics, and are considered one of the mascots of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Their original appearance and role was largely praised, although their change in design for the &quot;Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy&quot; sub-series was contentious.

==Character design==
===Influences===
Moogles were created by object designer Koichi Ishii, who later became the president of Grezzo. He stated they were based on a creature idea he drew in Elementary School based on an all-white koala. The creature could float by expanding their body and used their wings to control direction in midair. In an interview with Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, said that the Moogles were only meant to be a race of cave-dwelling people, and were not originally planned to be series mascots. Additionally, the Moogles were inspired by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, specifically the &quot;Infravision&quot; ability to see in the dark used by non-human races such as elves and dwarves.

In &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, the &quot;Good King Moggle Mog&quot; boss was created after the fights for the Primals Leviathan and Titan had to be cut from the game due to the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, as the &quot;Tsunami&quot; and &quot;Earthquake&quot; moves they used would have been in poor taste.

===Characteristics===
&quot;Mōguri&quot;, the Japanese transliteration of &quot;moogle&quot;, is a portmanteau of the words and . Moogles typically have white fur, and an antenna protruding from the head with a small red or yellow ball (called a &quot;pompom&quot;) at the end. They have small red or purple wings, and their ears are shaped like those of a cat or rabbit. They tend to end their sentences with . Despite originating in &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, &#x27;kupo&#x27; first originated in &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;. A Moogle&#x27;s favorite food is the Kupo Nut.

Moogles are frequently featured as creatures that may be summoned by the Summoner or Caller class of playable characters. Typically, moogles are lower-level summon spells acquired earlier in a given game.

== Appearances ==
===In the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series===
The first appearance of a Moogle was in &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; (1990), as the bodyguards of master wizard Doga. &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; (1994) was the first time a Moogle talked, was a playable character, and had a pom-pom on their head. Moogles appeared in almost every subsequent &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game, with different roles and slightly differing appearances over time. They also appeared in spin-off games such as &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;.

Moogle-themed attire has appeared in several of the games, with &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; including a wearable Moogle mascot costume for the character Yuna, and &quot;Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII&quot; having a dress made of Moogle dolls. A Moogle mascot costume also appears in &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;&#x27;s Moogle Chocobo Carnival.

===In other video games===
They first appeared outside of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; (1993), where they have a different, tan color palette and look catlike in appearance. &quot;Moogle&quot; also became a status effect in the &quot;Mana&quot; series where the playable characters are turned into moogles for a period of time or until the effect is healed. In the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, Moogles run the Synthesis workshops, where the player can use materials dropped by enemies to make items, equipment, and weapons.

==Promotion and reception==
Like other series mascots the Chocobo and the Cactuar, the Moogle has been subject to numerous licensed merchandise connected to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; theme, sometimes in collaboration with third parties such as Universal Studios Japan and Sony Interactive Entertainment for the 2017 video game &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Golf&quot;. Examples of merchandise which feature the Moogle as its iconography include stuffed toys, key chains, Christmas-themed cakes, wedding confectionary, and so on. 

 Square Enix partnered with a Japanese bridal company to introduce a real-life &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; wedding service that includes a giant virtual Moogle. A giant Moogle bed was created as a contest reward for the Japanese convenience store Lawson.

&quot;Official Australian PlayStation Magazine&quot; stated that &quot;nothing sums up the dichotomy of cutesiness for adult players quite like a Moogle&quot;, calling them &quot;cool little critters who wouldn&#x27;t be out of place sitting atop your computer screen at work&quot;, but also &quot;so sickeningly cute that thoughts turn to the business end of a hammer drill&quot;. Mike Fahey of &quot;Kotaku&quot; called the Moogle &quot;my favorite video game characters ever&quot; and &quot;awesome and adorable&quot;, though criticizing their design in &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot; as &quot;gross&quot;. Jason Schreier of the same publication called Good King Moogle Mog &quot;one of &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;″s most memorable bosses&quot;. However, that game&#x27;s Fat Moogle mount, which was released for US$40, was seen as &quot;exorbitant&quot; in price by fans.

Julia Lee of &quot;Polygon&quot; praised the Moogles of &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot;, calling them &quot;adorable cat-like creatures&quot;, but criticized them for having English voice acting, saying it &quot;ruin[ed] their tiny adorable appearance&quot;, and calling Mog, the player&#x27;s Moogle helper, &quot;annoying&quot;. Robert Ramsey of &quot;Push Square&quot; criticized the Moogle voice acting in &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot; and &quot;Type-0&quot;, saying &quot;we&#x27;re desperate for a return to Moogles that don&#x27;t sound like they&#x27;re helium enthusiasts&quot;.

In markets outside of Japan, the playable Moogle named Mog used as a mascot for &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. To this end, it appeared on its box art and print advertisements casually holding a dagger, as well as in claymation television commercials speaking with a gruff voice to showcase the individual monsters. Sebastian Deken in his book examining &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and its themes was highly critical of how Mog was used in this manner, especially coupled with the slogans implying the game was highly difficult, an aspect also unique to Western advertising. He felt that it was overall at odds with how Amano had portrayed the character in his artwork as cute and joyful, undermining both the character and the game&#x27;s public perception in those markets. He further summarized the campaign as using &quot;an adorable little cuddle-bear in a direct appeal to macho (or macho-aspiring) gamers&quot; and &quot;kawaii repackaged for the JV football team.&quot;

<doc id="285533" wikidata="Q133118" url="?curid=285533" title="Urfa">
<text>Urfa, officially called Şanlıurfa (), is a city in southeastern Turkey and the capital of Şanlıurfa Province. The city was known as [[Edessa]] from Hellenistic times and into Christian times. Urfa is situated on a plain about 80 km east of the Euphrates. Its climate features extremely hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.

About northeast of the city is the famous Neolithic site of Göbekli Tepe, the world&#x27;s oldest known temple, which was founded in the 10th millennium BC. The area was part of a network of the first human settlements where the agricultural revolution took place. Because of its association with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic history, and a legend according to which it was the hometown of Abraham, Urfa is nicknamed the &quot;City of Prophets.&quot;

Religion is important in Urfa. The city &quot;has become a center of fundamentalist Islamic beliefs&quot; and &quot;is considered one of the most devoutly religious cities in Turkey&quot;.

The city is located 30 miles from the Atatürk Dam, at the heart of the Southeast Anatolia Project, which draws thousands of job-seeking rural villagers to the city every year.

==Name==

The earliest name of the city was &quot;Admaʾ&quot; (also written &quot;Adme&quot;, &quot;Admi&quot;, &quot;Admum&quot;; ), recorded in Assyrian cuneiform in the Old Assyrian period. It is recorded in Syriac as ܐܕܡܐ &quot;Adme.&quot;

Modern names of the city are likely derived from Urhay or Orhay (), the site&#x27;s Syriac name before the re-foundation of the settlement by Seleucus I Nicator. After the defeat of the Seleucids in the Seleucid–Parthian Wars, Edessa became capital of the Kingdom of Osroene, with a mixed Syriac and Hellenistic culture. The origin of the name of Osroene itself is probably related to Orhay. This originally Aramaic and Syriac name for the city may have been derived from the Persian name Khosrow.

The ancient town was refounded as a Hellenistic military settlement by Seleucus I Nicator in BC, and named &quot;Edessa&quot; after the ancient capital of Macedonia, perhaps due to its abundant water, just like its Macedonian namesake. It was later renamed &quot;Callirrhoe&quot; or &quot;Antiochia on the Callirhoe&quot; (; ) in the 2nd century BC (found on Edessan coins struck by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, r. 175–164 BC).

After Antiochus IV&#x27;s reign, the name of the city reverted to Edessa, in Greek, and appears in Armenian as &quot;Urha&quot; or &quot;Ourha&quot; (), in Aramaic (Syriac) as &quot;Urhay&quot; or &quot;Orhay&quot; (), in local Neo-Aramaic (Turoyo) as &quot;Urhoy&quot;, in Arabic as &quot;ar-Ruhā&quot; (), in the Kurdish languages as , Latinized as &quot;Rohais&quot;, and finally adopted into Turkish as &quot;Urfa&quot; or &quot;Şanlıurfa&quot; (&quot;Glorious Urfa&quot;), its present name. 

James Silk Buckingham claimed that in earlier times, the city was known as &quot;Ruha&quot;, and with the Arabic article, it became &quot;Ar-Ruha&quot;, evolving into &quot;Urha&quot;, and eventually &quot;Urfa&quot;. Carsten Niebuhr observed that Turks called the city &quot;El-Rohha&quot; in the 18th century, although Buckingham who later visited Urfa, disagreed and noted that all Turks, and most Arabs and Kurds in the surrounding countryside called it Urfa, while a small portion of the Christians called it as the former.

In 1984, the Turkish National Assembly granted Urfa the title &quot;Şanlı&quot;, meaning &quot;glorious&quot;, in honor of its citizens&#x27; resistance against British and French troops at the end of the First World War, hence the present name &quot;Şanlıurfa&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory===

Urfa shares the Balikh River Valley region with two other significant Neolithic sites at Nevalı Çori and Göbekli Tepe. Settlements in the area originated around 9000 BC as a PPNA Neolithic sites located near Abraham&#x27;s Pool (Site Name: Balıklıgöl).

There is no written evidence for earlier settlement at the site, but Urfa&#x27;s favorable commercial and geographical placement suggests that there was a smaller settlement present prior to 303 BC. Perhaps Orhai&#x27;s absence from earlier written sources is due to the settlement having been small and unfortified prior to the Seleucid period.

In prehistoric times, the Urfa Region was attractive for human habitation because of its dense grazing areas and the presence of wild animals on migration routes. As a result, the area became densely populated, particularly in the Neolithic period.

In Urfa itself, there was a prehistoric settlement at Yeni Mahalle Höyüğü (aka Balıklıgöl Höyüğü), located immediately north of Balıklıgöl in the heart of the old town. Now buried under single-story houses, the site was accidentally discovered during road construction in the 1990s and then excavated in 1997 by the Şanlıurfa Museum Directorate. The findings included flint tools, arrowheads dated to the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B phase, and two round buildings with terrazzo floors. Animal bones found at the site indicate hunting activity, and charred seed samples indicate that the villagers cultivated wheat and barley. The village at Yeni Mahalle is radiocarbon dated to roughly 9400–8600 BCE.

====Bronze Age====
During the Uruk period expansion about 3200 BC. The villages Urfa and Harran began to transform into cities. By the Early Bronze Age (2900-2600 BCE) Urfa had grown into a walled city of 200ha. This city is located at the archeological site Kazane Tepe adjacent to modern Urfa.

A much later artifact is a black stone pedestal with a double bull relief, found at a hill called Külaflı Tepe in the former village of Cavşak in the 1950s when the village was being evacuated to build a base for the Urfa Brigade. The pedestal contains an inscription with an invocation to the god Tarhunza and mentions a city whose name is only partly visible, but which Bahattin Çelik restores as &quot;Umalia&quot;, in the country of Bit Adini.

===City of Edessa===

Urfa was founded as a city under the name Edessa by the Seleucid king Seleucus I Nicator in 302 or 303 BC. Seleucus named the city Edessa after the ancient capital of Macedonia.

Ancient sources describe Seleucid Edessa as following the typical plan for Hellenistic military colonies: its streets were laid out in a grid pattern, with four main streets that intersected each other. There were four city gates, and the main citadel was outside the walls. Macedonian soldiers were settled in the new city, but they never formed a majority of its population. The city&#x27;s culture remained predominantly Semitic (specifically Aramaic), and any Hellenization was minimal.

Edessa was an important commercial center in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. Previously, the main east-west trade route across Upper Mesopotamia had gone through Harran, but the founding of Edessa caused that route to shift northwards.

In 132 BC, following the decline of the Seleucids, Edessa became the capital of the kingdom of Osrhoene, which was ruled by the Abgarids, an Arabized tribal dynasty with origins in Nisibis. The Abgarids were generally allied with the Parthian Empire and were under Parthian cultural influence as well.
In the early second century AD, Abgar VII supported the Roman emperor Trajan&#x27;s campaign in Mesopotamia and received him &quot;sumptously&quot; at his court, but later rebelled. In retaliation, the Romans captured and destroyed Edessa, and Abgar VII was killed. The Romans installed a Parthian prince, Parthamaspates, on the Edessan throne as a puppet ruler in 117, but the Abgarids were later restored to power. Similarly, the Parthians captured Edessa in 163 and installed Wa&#x27;el bar Sharu as a puppet king. The deposed Ma&#x27;nu VIII went to the Romans, who took Edessa in 165 and restored Ma&#x27;nu to power. In 166, Osrhoene became a Roman client kingdom.

Ma&#x27;nu VIII died in 177 and was succeeded by Abgar VIII, also called Abgar the Great. Abgar was stripped of most of his domains except for Edessa, and Osrhoene became a Roman province, when his ally Pescennius Niger lost the civil war to Septimius Severus. Abgar devoted his remaining time to fostering arts and learning. In 201, much of Edessa was destroyed by a major flood. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot;, over 2,000 people died. Abgar granted a remission of taxes for people affected by the flood and immediately began a large-scale reconstruction project of the city after the old Seleucid plan. Abgar repaired the old royal palace by the river, which had been damaged by the flood, but he also built a new palace on higher ground.
Ancient Edessa was an eclectic melting pot of different religious groups. Unlike Harran, where the cult of the moon god Sin predominated, the people of Edessa worshipped a whole pantheon of gods that can generally be identified with planets. In addition to polytheists, Edessa also had a prominent Jewish community. Many of Edessa&#x27;s Jews were merchants, involved in long-distance trade between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean. By the end of the 2nd century, a small Christian community had appeared in Edessa. Christianity also resonated with several religious themes already present in Edessa – besides the concept of a virgin mother and child, there was also the concept of a divine trinity and a hope for life after death. Edessa&#x27;s Jewish community was probably partly responsible for the rapid spread of Christianity in the city. Abgar the Great reportedly converted to Christianity around the turn of the 3rd century, which if true would make Edessa the first Christian polity in the world.

More religions joined the mix during the 3rd century. One was the Bardaisanites, founded by the important philosopher Bardaisan who Abgar the Great was a patron of. Another was the Elkesaites, a syncretic religion that combined elements of Christianity, Judaism, and paganism. There was already an active Manichaean community in Edessa during Mani&#x27;s lifetime: there is a reference in the Cologne Mani Codex to a letter he wrote to his followers in Edessa. Manichaeism&#x27;s spread to Edessa was attributed to two of Mani&#x27;s disciples named Addai and Thomas. Edessa&#x27;s Manichaean community remained prominent until the 5th century.

====Roman rule====
Abgar the Great died in 212 and was succeeded by Abgar IX, also called Severus as a sign of Roman influence. Abgar IX only reigned for a year – in 213, he was summoned to Rome by the emperor Caracalla, who then had him murdered. In 214, Caracalla made Edessa a Roman colony, officially ending any autonomy the city had. A son of Abgar IX, known as Ma&#x27;nu IX, appears to have been nominally a king until 240; he received an embassy from India in 218, during the reign of Elagabalus, but he did nothing else of note. The monarchy seems to have been restored to power at some point – and Abgar IX was apparently king until 248, when the emperor Philip the Arab had him banished after Edessa rebelled.

In 260, the Sasanian emperor Shapur I defeated the Romans in the Battle of Edessa and captured the emperor. However, either Shapur never actually captured the city or he only held it for a very short time – it is not listed among the cities he captured in his inscription on the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht, and in the aftermath of the battle he had to bribe Edessa&#x27;s garrison to let his army pass unmolested.

As a result of Diocletian&#x27;s reorganization of the empire in 293, a state-run factory was built at Edessa to make weapons and equipment for the soldiers stationed along the border. In 298, after Galerius Maximianus&#x27;s victory over the Sasanians, Edessa was made capital of the new province of Osrhoene. It served as a military base in the Mesopotamian &quot;limes&quot;, although it was secondary to Nisibis in that system.

====Late antiquity====
In the 4th through 6th centuries AD, Edessa went through arguably its period of greatest prosperity. It was again an important commercial center, and merchants grew rich on trade in luxury goods from the east, particularly silk. As with later periods, the city had a council of notable citizens who were at least partly in charge of local government and administration. In the 5th century there were three different theological schools in Edessa: the School of the Syrians (affiliated with the patriarchate of Antioch), the School of the Armenians, and the famous School of the Persians (whose teachers were not actually Persians but rather members of the Church of the East). The School of the Persians was closed down in 489 and its staff relocated to Nisibis. There were many churches in the city and monasteries in the area. Just outside the walls were several infirmaries and hospitals.

When the Roman emperor Jovian surrendered Nisibis to the Sasanians in 363, an influx of refugees came to Edessa, including many Christians. One of these refugees was the writer and theologian Ephrem the Syrian, who was a co-founder of the School of the Persians in Edessa. According to T.A. Sinclair, as Christianity gained more of a presence in Edessa, the pagan planet-worshippers increasingly emigrated to Harran.

By the early 6th century, a small lake had formed on the west side of the city. In 525, a flood destroyed part of the western city wall and damaged some of the city. Afterwards, a deep ditch was dug on the north and east sides of the city to act as a flood channel. In normal weather, a low dam kept the Daisan river in its original course, but if the dam overflowed, then the floodwaters would flow through the artificial channel instead of into the city. At some point later on, the flood channel became the normal course of the river.

Edessa successfully held out during a siege in 544. In 609, however, the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II captured Edessa during his campaign in Mesopotamia. Many of the city&#x27;s Monophysites were deported to Iran. In 628, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius captured Edessa.

===Age of Islam===
Urfa surrendered to the Rashidun general Iyad ibn Ghanm in 639 without resistance, supposedly when Iyad &quot;stood at its gate riding a brown horse&quot; according to al-Baladhuri. Several versions of the terms of surrender appear in historical sources, mentioning the citizens would be responsible for &quot;repairing &#x27;bridges and roads&#x27;&quot;. The pact also guaranteed that the city&#x27;s Christians would keep ownership of the cathedral. Sometime shortly after Urfa submitted to Muslim rule, a mosque was built in the city, although its location is unknown.

In the early centuries of Arab rule, and particularly under the Umayyads, Urfa was still a major Christian city. It formed part of the province of Diyar Mudar. The city reportedly had 300 or 360 churches, and there were many monasteries. The population was mostly Syrian Orthodox but with significant Melkite and Jewish minorities; there were relatively few Muslims. The city was led by a group of distinguished citizens, including magnates and agricultural landowners, who &quot;formed a partly self-governing body&quot; that dealt with the caliphal government rather than the bishop. Some of the leading families in this period included the Gūmāyē, the Telmaḥrāyē, and the Ruṣāfāyē.
During the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur, the city walls were demolished after the local Muslim governor revolted. The old walls had already been damaged by floods in the 7th and 8th centuries. In 812, Urfa&#x27;s citizens had to pay a large sum to the anti-Abbasid rebel Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli to prevent him from attacking the unprotected city. Afterwards, the citizens had new defensive walls built around the city. According to Bar Hebraeus, the walls were commissioned by someone named Abu Shaykh and paid for by the citizens. The walls and towers visible today belong to this rebuilding effort, albeit with later renovations. The citadel was likely begun at the same time, probably with the addition of a moat on the south side.

When the caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun came to power in 813, he dispatched his general Tahir ibn Husayn to Urfa to put down Nasr ibn Shabath&#x27;s rebellion. The rebels besieged Tahir&#x27;s forces in Urfa, but the local civilians (one of them was the future Syriac church leader Dionysius I Telmaharoyo) supported the soldiers and the siege was unsuccessful. Tahir&#x27;s troops later mutinied, however, and he was forced to flee to Raqqa; he later appointed someone named &#x27;Abd al-A&#x27;la as governor of Urfa. In 825, while Tahir&#x27;s son Abdallah was governor of al-Jazira, his brother Muhammad enacted a series of anti-Christian policies in Urfa. He ordered the destruction of several churches, claiming that they had illegally been built after the Muslim conquest. That same year, he also had a new mosque built in the tetrapylon in front of the city&#x27;s Melkite cathedral. Before its conversion into a mosque, the tetrapylon had been a meeting place for church leaders. The locations of the mosque and cathedral are unknown.

In the spring of 943, the Byzantine army campaigned in upper Mesopotamia, capturing several cities and either threatening Urfa or, according to Symeon Magister, besieging it outright. The Byzantines demanded that the &quot;mandylion&quot; (called &quot;al-mandīl&quot; in Arabic), by now a famous Christian relic, be handed over to the emperor. In return, the city would be spared and 200 Muslim prisoners would be released. With permission from the caliph al-Muttaqi, the people of Edessa handed over the &quot;mandylion&quot; and signed a truce with the Byzantines. The &quot;mandylion&quot; was translated to Constantinople; it arrived &quot;triumphantly&quot; on 15 August 944.

===11th century===
The Numayrid emir Waththab ibn Sabiq declared independence in 990 and annexed Edessa early in his reign. Waththab appointed his cousin &#x27;Utayr as governor of the city. &#x27;Utayr installed someone named Ahmad ibn Muhammad as his &quot;na&#x27;ib&quot; (deputy) here, but then later had him assassinated. This evidently made &#x27;Utayr unpopular with the locals, since Ahmad had treated them well. In 1025/6 (416 AH), the city&#x27;s inhabitants rebelled and appealed to Nasr ad-Dawla, the Marwanid emir of Diyar Bakr. At first, Nasr ad-Dawla appointed someone named Zangi to be his deputy in Edessa, but Zangi died in 1027. Meanwhile, &#x27;Utayr had been assassinated. This time, Nasr ad-Dawla ended up appointing two deputies to jointly control Edessa: he chose &#x27;Utayr&#x27;s son, known only by the &quot;nasab&quot; &quot;Ibn &#x27;Utayr&quot;, to be in charge of the main citadel, while he appointed a different Numayrid named Shibl ad-Dawla to be in charge of the smaller citadel – i.e. the converted east gate, now the Bey Kapısı.
In October 1031, the Byzantine general George Maniakes conquered Edessa. This would ultimately be the last significant territorial acquisition by the Byzantine Empire in Mesopotamia. The accounts of this event differ heavily. According to one version, Ibn &#x27;Utayr had entered into negotiations with Maniakes, intending to sell him the citadel. His desire to sell was apparently motivated by a threat from Shibl ad-Dawla. In John Skylitzes&#x27;s version, however, Maniakes had bribed Salman, a deputy of Nasr ad-Dawla&#x27;s, into surrendering the city to him in the middle of the night. If this was the case, then Salman either had some authority over Ibn &#x27;Utayr or had otherwise deposed him.

Whoever Maniakes had been negotiating with, Byzantine forces gained control of some of the fortifications but not the rest of the city. Exactly which parts Maniakes had taken control of are unclear – Skylitzes described Maniakes had taken possession of &quot;three heavily fortified towers&quot;, but his description of Edessa&#x27;s geography is completely inaccurate and he clearly had never been to the city himself. Matthew of Edessa&#x27;s account, which is more reliable, mentions &quot;three citadels&quot;; according to Tara Andrews, the upper citadel must have been one of them. According to T.A. Sinclair, Maniakes had already gained control of the upper citadel. That winter, Nasr ad-Dawla came with an army in an attempt to drive out the Byzantines. Nasr ad-Dawla tried to besiege the Byzantine positions but was unsuccessful and decided to loot the city and tear down buildings, then burn the city to the ground while retreating with camels carrying off precious objects. According to Skylitzes, Maniakes was able to then capture the citadel and, summoning external reinforcements, secure the whole city.

Maniakes remained in charge of Edessa for several years and, according to Honigmann and Bosworth, appears to have been relatively autonomous from the Byzantines, merely sending an annual tribute to Constantinople. On the other hand, while Skylitzes does mention that &quot;Maniakes sent an annual tribute of 50 pounds [of gold] to the emperor&quot;, Niccolò Zorzi remarks that this &quot;does not necessarily imply that Edessa &#x27;enjoyed a certain amount of independence from Byzantium&#x27;&quot;. The citadel became known as &quot;Maniakes&#x27;s citadel&quot; at some point.

In May 1036, the Numayri prince Ibn Waththab plundered the city and took the &quot;patricius&quot; of Edessa as prisoner, but the fortress remained in the hands of the Byzantine garrison. A peace treaty was reached in 1037; under its terms, Edessa came directly under Byzantine control and it was refortified. Edessa now became an important Byzantine command placed under a series of katepanos and dukes. The &quot;duchy&quot; of Edessa probably comprised the whole area beyond the Euphrates under their control with several fortresses north of the river. The city &quot;was still inhabited by many Christians&quot; at this point.

In 1065-6 and 1066-7, the city was attacked by the Turkish leader Khurasan-Salar. For 50 days beginning on 10 March 1071, Urfa was besieged by the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan. Alp Arslan eventually lifted the siege in return for a large payment and possibly also the submission of its ruler, the &quot;doux&quot; Basilios Alousianos (son of Alusian of Bulgaria). After the Battle of Manzikert, Edessa was intended to be handed over to the Seljuks, but the Byzantine emperor Romanos Diogenes was deposed and in the political chaos its katepano Paulus ended up siding with the new emperor.

In 1077 or 1078, Basil Apokapes besieged and captured Edessa, displacing the Byzantine governor Leo Diabatenos. He was an agent of Philaretos Brachamios, the main Byzantine agent in the region who governed from Marash; however, Basil ruled Edessa independently. In 1081-2, an amir named Khusraw unsuccessfully besieged the city. After Basil&#x27;s death in 1083, the citizens of Edessa elected an Armenian named Smbat to succeed him. Smbat was in charge for six months before Philaretos came in person on 23 September 1083. He appointed a Greek eunuch as governor and gave him the title &quot;parakoimomenos&quot;; this eunuch was later assassinated by an official named Barsauma.

However, Edessa was in a particularly vulnerable position &quot;caught between two blocks of Uqaylid territory&quot;, and it was particularly vulnerable to the Seljuks. In 1086-7, the Seljuk sultan Malik Shah I sent his general Buzan to take the city while he himself campaigned in Syria. A three-month siege followed, with Barsauma defending the city. The city surrendered in March 1087 and Buzan appointed a Seljuk commander to head the citadel. At some point, an Armenian named Toros in charge of the city administration – according to the Syriac &quot;Chronicle of 1234&quot;, this happened in 1087, while Matthew of Edessa wrote that it happened after Buzan&#x27;s death in 1094. Toros appears to have begun a rebuilding project on the Bey Kapısı fortress, but it wasn&#x27;t finished until after his rule. Meanwhile, Malik Shah had died in 1092 and a Seljuk dynastic crisis had broken out. In 1094, Malik Shah&#x27;s brother Tutush demanded the city&#x27;s surrender, but both Toros and the Seljuk citadel commander refused. Tutush&#x27;s forces seized the citadel and made their encampment on the west side of the city. Fearing an attack from them, Toros apparently tried to cut the citadel off by building a wall between it and the city. After Tutush died in 1095, however, his forces abandoned the citadel and Toros now took control of the whole city as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent ruler.

During the 11th century, there was a large influx of Armenian immigrants into the region, especially the towns. In Urfa, they supplanted Syrians as the leading citizens and wealthiest landowners.

===County of Edessa===
Urfa was capital of the crusader County of Edessa for about half a century beginning in 1098. The crusaders&#x27; subjects were a mix of Armenians and Syrians. In Urfa itself, Armenians were the dominant group. The crusaders themselves don&#x27;t seem to have undertaken much construction in Urfa. The only extant structure that can be attributed to them is the southernmost tower of the Bey Kapısı, on the east side of the city walls. This was completing the rebuilding that Toros had begun before the crusaders seized Edessa and was finished in 1122-3, while the count Joscelin I was in captivity at Harput.

====Sieges of 1144 and 1146====

The County of Edessa had survived largely because their Muslim rivals were disunited. The rise of a single powerful Muslim rival – namely Imad ad-Din Zangi, the crafty atabeg of Mosul – spelled disaster for the county. The tipping point came in late 1144, when Joscelin II left Edessa with a big chunk of his soldiers to assist Zengi&#x27;s rival Kara Arslan.

Upon becoming aware of the city&#x27;s weakness, Zengi led a series of forced marches and laid siege to the city on 24 November. By 24 December, he had successfully gained entry to the city; the citadel fell two days later on the 26th. Zengi&#x27;s forces spared the native Christian population and their churches, but the Franks were killed and their churches destroyed. Zengi then appointed Zayn ad-Din Ali Küçük, the commander of his guard, as governor of the city.

The fall of Edessa was a direct motivator for the Second Crusade. Christian pilgrims returning to Europe brought news of the city&#x27;s conquest, and emissaries from the crusader states also came to appeal for help. The pope responded by issuing the papal bull &quot;Quantum praedecessores&quot; on 1 December 1145, which directly called for another crusade. Meanwhile, in the Muslim world, news of this victory made Zengi a hero. The caliph gave him many gifts and titles, including &quot;al-malik al-mansūr&quot; – &quot;the victorious king&quot;.

In May 1146, there was a plot by Urfa&#x27;s Armenian community to overthrow the Turks and restore the city to Joscelin II. The Turks suppressed this plot and settled 300 Jewish families in the city. However, after Zengi was assassinated on 14 September 1146, the Armenians again conspired with Joscelin II to take the city. Sometime in October, Joscelin II and Baldwin of Marash came and laid siege to the city. This second siege proved far more destructive than the first. The Franks succeeded in entering the city, but they were not properly equipped for a siege of the main citadel. During their six-day-long reoccupation of Urfa, the Franks indiscriminately looted shops belonging to Christians and Muslims alike. The city&#x27;s Muslims either fled to Harran or took shelter in the citadel with the Turkish garrison.

Meanwhile, Imad ad-Din&#x27;s successor Nur ad-Din Zengi had arrived with an army of 10,000 soldiers and surrounded the city. When the Franks realized they were trapped, they attempted to retreat, but it ended in disaster and they were slaughtered as they tried to escape. Moreover, the city&#x27;s population was massacred – the men were put to death, while the women and children were sold into slavery. The city&#x27;s Christian community, one of the oldest in the world, had been destroyed and never recovered.

===Zengid and Ayyubid rules===
Although Nur ad-Din was an active builder elsewhere, only one building at Urfa can be attributed to him: the &quot;rather plain&quot; Great Mosque, which was probably on the site of an earlier church. After Nur ad-Din&#x27;s death in 1174, Urfa was captured by his nephew Sayf al-Din Ghazi II.
Saladin captured Urfa in 1182 after a siege; he then separately besieged the citadel. He ended up paying the defenders off to let him take control of the citadel. He then appointed Muzaffar al-Din Gökböri as governor of Urfa along with Harran. During Saladin&#x27;s reign, the cathedral of the Melkites was demolished. Part was used as building material for Urfa&#x27;s citadel, and part was taken to Harran.

The Ayyubid empire essentially functioned as a dynastic &quot;confederation of principalities united under one leading prince&quot;. During Saladin&#x27;s reign, he established a principality based at Harran; Urfa was part of this principality. After Gökböri, the Harran-Urfa principality was also held by Saladin&#x27;s brother al-Adil, who later ruled as the Ayyubid sultan himself.

During Ayyubid rule, Edessa had a population of approximately 24,000, according to J.C. Russell&#x27;s estimate (Russell generally favored smaller, more conservative estimates).

In June 1234, the city was taken by the Seljuk sultan Kayqubad I&#x27;s army, and its inhabitants were deported to Anatolia. However, it was recaptured within four months by the Ayyubid ruler al-Kamil. Sometime shortly thereafter, the citadel was slighted on al-Kamil&#x27;s orders.

===Mongol rule===
In 1260, Urfa voluntarily submitted to the troops of Hulagu and thus came under Mongol rule. Because the city had surrendered peacefully, its inhabitants were spared.

The Mongols never garrisoned Urfa; it was near their western border with the Mamluk Sultanate and was probably seen as &quot;too difficult to defend&quot;. Its ruined fortress was &quot;probably not thought worth repairing&quot;. The city was desolate at this point; its inhabitants had evacuated or abandoned it and &quot;only Turcoman nomads lived in the otherwise empty city&quot;.

===Mamluk and Aq Qoyunlu rules===
The Mamluks gained control of Urfa sometime in the early 14th century. They renovated the ruined citadel probably during the third reign of an-Nasir Muhammad (1309–40), but the city &quot;attracted few inhabitants&quot;. The Mamluk garrison only occupied the citadel itself; the surrounding city was still practically deserted and not worth committing any soldiers to defend. Located close to the Mamluks&#x27; eastern frontier, Urfa had &quot;no commercial importance&quot; because merchant traffic in Upper Mesopotamia was taking a route through Mardin and Ra&#x27;s al-&#x27;Ayn rather than through Amid and Urfa.

That changed in the late 14th century, toward the end of the Mamluk period. Some commercial traffic had begun passing through Urfa enroute to Aleppo, and the city became at least partly repopulated. By around 1400, al-Qalqashandi wrote that Urfa had been rebuilt and was prosperous again. Meanwhile, in 1394, Timur occupied Urfa without much resistance; he &quot;admired the buildings and took away some of the portable wealth&quot;.

The Aq Qoyunlu seized Urfa, a strategic military outpost on their western frontier, in the late 1410s or early 1420s. At some point, the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Kara Osman granted Urfa to his son Ali, whose quarrels with his brothers beginning in autumn 1428, prompted Kara Osman to replace him with Ali&#x27;s brother Habil as governor of Urfa. Ali left Urfa in 1429 and headed north where he laid siege to Harpoot, which fell before Mamluk aid could come to the city&#x27;s aid. This prompted the Mamluks to attack Urfa, an Aq Qoyunlu base that posed threat to Mamluk-held Aleppo. One day before the main Mamluk army arrived, a &quot;local Arab contingent&quot; reached Urfa and defeated Habil&#x27;s Turkic forces. The Mamluk army arrived the next day and besieged the city. On 24 July, the citadel surrendered, and the Mamluks demolished the fortress and enslaved the women and children, killing many others. Contemporary historians compared the violent event to Timur&#x27;s sack of Damascus in 1400.

About a decade later, Urfa was involved in the civil war between Ali Beg&#x27;s son Jahangir and Jahangir&#x27;s uncle Hamza for control of the Aq Qoyunlu. The contemporary historian Tihrani Isfahani wrote that Hamza&#x27;s troops besieged Urfa but did not elaborate. Jahangir ended up making Urfa his main base at some point, from which he attacked Hamza in Erzincan and then later sent a raid against Ergani. Urfa was then the site of a battle in 1451, where Uzun Hasan successfully defeated other Aq Qoyunlu leaders shortly before gaining control of the tribal confederation as a whole. In 1462-3, under Uzun Hasan&#x27;s reign, Urfa&#x27;s citadel was renovated.

In early November 1480, a large Mamluk army under Yashbak min Mahdi, who was &quot;dawātdār-i kabīr&quot; or executive secretary to the Mamluk sultan Qaitbay, laid siege to Urfa. Yashbak bombarded the city walls with heavy cannon fire and used catapults to hurl fireballs into the city. This happened during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, prompting Fazlallah Khunji Isfahani to liken Yashbak&#x27;s actions to the tyrant Nimrod torturing the prophet Abraham with fire – also in Urfa, according to tradition. Aq Qoyunlu forces quickly arrived at Urfa from Diyar Bakr and, after a failed attempt at negotiations, a pitched battle took place. The Aq Qoyunlu army&#x27;s right wing was commanded by Sulayman Beg Bijan and the left wing was commanded by Khalil Beg Mawsillu. The Mamluk forces were utterly defeated, and Yashbak was later executed.

===Ottoman period===


Urfa was likely initially incorporated into the Ottoman Empire during the rule of Selim I around 1517. The earliest surviving Ottoman tax register for Urfa, compiled in 1518, documented 1,082 families (700 Muslim and 382 Christian), suggesting a total population slightly exceeding 5,500 people. The relatively low population figure can be attributed to political turmoil in the region, particularly the ongoing conflict with Safavid Iran. By 1526, the city&#x27;s population had increased to 1,322 families (988 Muslim and 334 Christian), indicating an estimated population of approximately 8,000.

Urfa experienced a renaissance under Ottoman rule. Industry and commerce picked back up, and its population rebounded, although it never reached the same population heights it had once held in the classical and early medieval periods. The high point lasted for about a century and a half, beginning with its conquest by the Ottomans. According to Mehmet Adil Saraç, Urfa&#x27;s population first became majority Turkish sometime during this period, sometime between 1520 and 1570. By 1566, a tax register shows the city with an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 people (1,704 Muslim families and 866 Christian families). At this point, the city was described as having five large &quot;mahalle&quot;s, each named after one of the five city gates, and it &quot;must have had an active textile industry&quot;. A bedestan is also recorded. Urfa&#x27;s prosperity in the 1500s was based on both trade and agricultural production. Urfa was an important entrepot on trade routes between Iran and Aleppo.

Because of its prosperity, Urfa&#x27;s population grew as it attracted residents from nearby cities. In 1586, Ottoman authorities created the Eyalet of Raqqa out of territories that had previously belonged to the Eyalet of Diyarbekir, and Urfa became &quot;the center of economic and political power&quot; in this new province. At the same time, the city&#x27;s prosperity attracted bandits and nomadic tribes, although the urban population was largely unaffected. That changed at the end of the century, when the revolt of Karayazıcı Abdulhalim turned Urfa into a battlefield.

Relatively little is known about Karayazıcı, but he was presumably a tribesman who worked as a bureaucrat in the local administration (&quot;Yazıcı&quot; means &quot;scribe&quot;). His army was recruited from other local tribal members. In 1599–1600 (1008 AH), Karayazıcı&#x27;s army laid siege to the outer and then inner citadel and thus gained control of Urfa. The contemporary historian Mustafa Selaniki blamed Urfa&#x27;s fall on the governors of Aleppo and Damascus failing to send reinforcements in time. He set up a &quot;quasi-state&quot; based at Urfa&#x27;s inner citadel, declaring himself sultan and Hüseyin Pasha (who had worked with him to capture the citadel) as grand vizier. Eventually, though, Ottoman troops (backed by reinforcements from Damascus and Aleppo) surrounded the inner citadel, dug trenches, and engaged the rebels in a bloody battle in the middle of the city. The rebels ran into ammunition shortages during the battle and had to melt down coins to use as bullets. Hüseyin Pasha was killed in the battle, but Karayazıcı himself managed to escape.

The instability accompanying the Celali revolts, and especially Karayazıcı&#x27;s occupation of the city, must have sapped Urfa&#x27;s prosperity. Several 17th-century accounts refer to parts of the town as being in disrepair. For example, when Jean-Baptiste Tavernier visited Urfa in 1644, &quot;there were so many empty lots that [he] compared the town to a desert&quot;. The central Ottoman state&#x27;s control of the surrounding Raqqa Eyalet weakened significantly in the early 1600s. Powerful &quot;ümera&quot; families from Urfa assumed responsibility for governance of the eyalet, while the actual office of governor was a sinecure for prominent Ottoman generals or their sons.

Urfa court records from about 1629 to 1631 (1039–40 AH) provide insight into local government during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1623–1629. The Ottomans were in the process of mobilizing troops and resources in the area for the war effort, and the qadi of Urfa was responsible for billeting troops and gathering provisions. In August 1638, Sultan Murad IV stayed at Urfa along with his army while en route to Baghdad in the final campaign of the war. He ordered restoration work on the citadel, which is mentioned in written sources and confirmed by an inscription on the walls that still exists.

The most detailed account of early Ottoman Urfa was written by Evliya Çelebi, who visited the city in 1646. Part of his interest may have been because one of his relatives was a qadi here. His account mentions only three gates, with different names than those of the 1566 tax register. Evliya wrote that he counted 2,600 houses in the fortified part of the city, which probably indicates a population total similar to 1566. At this point, Urfa had houses generally made of mud brick; more opulent houses, belonging to paşas and qadis, had their own gardens and baths. Evliya also recorded 22 mosques, 3 medreses, and 3 zaviyes. He listed several hans, including the Yemiş Hânı, the Samsatkapısı, the Hacı İbrâhim Hânı, the Beykapısı Hânı, and the Sebîl Hânı. He also wrote that the city had 400 shops and several mills, including one named after one Tayyaroğlu Ahmed Paşa. However, he was apparently unimpressed by the city&#x27;s shops and markets.

Evliya also wrote that Urfa had a tannery that produced high-quality yellow maroquin leather. Tavernier also noted the city&#x27;s leather, saying that along with Tokat and Diyarbakır it produced some of the best maroquin leathers. Besides leather, Urfa was also renowned for its cotton fabrics during this period.

According to Onur Usta, part of why Urfa appeared to European visitors as &quot;a derelict city with houses reduced to rubble&quot; during this period was because it had a lot of residents from nomadic and tribal backgrounds. These people would have still engaged in nomadic transhumance activities during most parts of the year and &quot;only needed a roof over their heads during the winter&quot;. The abandoned-looking houses would have belonged to them.
Information about Urfa during the 1700s is relatively scarce, but one source is the fiscal records of the new Rızvaniye Mosque. These document the waqf properties assigned to the mosque, including shops, gardens, mills, and public baths, as well as information about tenants and rents. Based on various fiscal and tax documents, it seems that Urfa suffered a series of troubles in the 1750s and began to sink into poverty. One of the most serious problems was rampant banditry, which both impeded agricultural production in surrounding rural areas and hindered economic recovery.

A serious outbreak of plague hit Urfa in the 1780s, and many people died. Iraqi Turkmen, particularly from the regions around Mosul and Kirkuk, were deported and resettled in Urfa to help repopulate the city. The connection with Kirkuk in particular left cultural and linguistic traces in Urfa, and some present-day Urfalis have described the two cities as having an &quot;uncle-nephew relationship&quot;.

====19th century====

In the Ottoman period, Urfa was a center of commerce because of its location at a crossroads with Diyarbakır, Antep, Mardin, and Raqqa. Many Jewish, Armenian, and Greek merchants were present in Urfa, especially from Aleppo.

James Silk Buckingham visited Urfa in 1816 and ended up stuck there for a while because the roads were closed due to the ongoing Ottoman-Wahhabi War. Buckingham&#x27;s account of early-1800s Urfa is one of the most informative of the late Ottoman period. By this time, the name &quot;Urfa&quot; had come to predominate, with only the city&#x27;s Arab Christians still calling it &quot;al-Ruha&quot;. The standard of living in Urfa had evidently increased since the 1600s – the mud brick houses recorded by Evliya Çelebi had given way to finer masonry structures that Buckingham compared to the houses of Aleppo. The houses described by Buckingham had &quot;harem&quot; and &quot;selamlik&quot; quarters separated by a courtyard, with the &quot;selamlik&quot;s boasting &quot;opulently furnished reception rooms&quot; on their upper floors. Buckingham described the city as being divided into janissary and sharif factions, also like Aleppo. Many of the city&#x27;s bazaars were closed due to the war, but Buckingham noted that Urfa had a thriving cotton trade during peacetime and observed some of the city&#x27;s cotton printers at work. Coarser wool cloth and rugs were also manufactured in Urfa.

In the mid-1800s, Urfa benefitted from a general increase in commercial activity in the region. Most of the larger courtyard houses in the present-day old town probably date from this period. The large Armenian church on the western main street was built in 1842 and many mosques were probably also built around this time. According to Suraiya Faroqhi, though, the city&#x27;s population &quot;must have been at a low ebb for several decades in the mid-century&quot;.
However, in the late 1800s, Urfa declined in importance as a commercial center. In particular, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 caused a major realignment of trade routes, shifting away from overland caravans and towards maritime commerce. As a result, the volume of commercial traffic coming through Urfa decreased markedly compared to previous periods and became increasingly local/regional in nature. The local economy shifted away from producing goods for export and toward meeting the basic needs of the local population. Workshops produced less in general during this period and their focus was more on cheap basic goods like local fabrics and household goods. Imports also declined because the locals were focusing more on consuming cheap basic goods rather than luxuries; they were living simpler, more frugal lives. Because people were using more local products, the cost of living also decreased and people had to work less to meet their expenses. Contemporary court records document that there was extensive commercial contact between Muslims and non-Muslims; they bought and sold goods freely between each other and entered into commercial partnerships together, indicating that there was relatively high trust between both groups.

The main centers of commercial activity in the Ottoman period were the bazaars, where both local and imported goods were bought and sold. Generally, a bazaar would be named after its primary function and main goods sold there. For example, the İsotçular Çarşısı was named because of the homemade chili peppers sold in this street. Among the bazaars mentioned in late 19th-century records: Kadıoğlu, Köroğlu, Eski Arasa, Teymurcu, Sarayönü, Belediye, Beykapı, Akar, Sipâhî, Bedestan, Hânönü, Kafavhâne, and Hüseyniye.

There was a huge increase in the number of hans recorded in the &quot;Aleppo Salname&quot;s in the late 1800s: from just 7 in 1867 to 11 in 1888, 18 in 1889, and 32 in 1898. According to Yasin Taş, this is because not only were new hans being built, but records were simply counting more types of commercial buildings as hans. Muslim and non-Muslim travelers would both use the same hans regardless of religion.

In the countryside surrounding Urfa, life went on largely unchanged. Most rural villagers were involved in agriculture, and farmlands were typically plowed using the same low-tech methods that had been used for thousands of years. Cows and oxen were kept as draft animals. Irrigated farmland around the Euphrates and some streams was more expensive than the waterless fields called &quot;deştî land&quot; which was not able to be irrigated. Irrigation channels were repaired jointly among the people who used the water. Sometimes there would be people living in the city (often non-Muslim) who would own farmland outside the city and deputize local villagers (often Muslim) to run the farm under the muzâraa contract. In 1846, taxes could not be collected because of drought and locusts. In 1861, 1863, and 1886, there were locusts; in 1870 there was a drought due to lack of rain.

Up until the mid-1890s, about 20,000 of the city&#x27;s 60,000 residents were Armenians. In 1895, however, thousands of Armenians were killed in a series of massacres by both civilians and soldiers. First, in October, Turkish and Kurdish locals killed hundreds of Armenians over a two-day period. Then for two months the Armenian quarter was effectively subjected to a siege, with no food or water allowed in. The Turks claimed that the Armenians had a weapon cache, which they demanded in return for lifting the siege. In December, the siege ended when &quot;a crowd of Turkish soldiers and civilians&quot; entered the Armenian quarter and killed thousands of its inhabitants. About 3,000 survivors sought shelter in a nearby church – which is normally recognized as a place of refuge under Islamic law. However, soldiers burned the church to the ground, killing everyone inside. The troops went on to loot and burn the rest of the Armenian quarter. According to Lord Kinross, some 8,000 Armenians were killed in total.

There was a small but ancient Jewish community in Urfa, with a population of about 1,000 by the 19th century. Most of the Jews emigrated in 1896, fleeing the Hamidian massacres, and settling mainly in Aleppo, Tiberias and Jerusalem. There were three Christian communities: Syriac, Armenian, and Latin. The last Neo-Aramaic Christians left in 1924 and went to Aleppo (where they settled in a place that was later called &quot;Hay al-Suryan&quot; &quot;The Syriac Quarter&quot;).

===First World War and after===

During the First World War, Urfa was a site of the Armenian and Assyrian genocides, beginning in 1915. Members of Urfa&#x27;s Armenian community were deported and killed. In May, 18 families were deported from Urfa, and in June, 50 people were arrested, tortured, and then deported to Diyarbakır, where they were killed on the road. Urfa was also a stop on the deportation route, and the Urfa resistance in October was composed of Armenians deported from Van and Diyarbakır. Survivors from killings elsewhere had begun to arrive in Urfa, and by mid-August, massacres had begun in Urfa itself. Some 400 Armenians were taken to the edge of town and killed during a four-day period from 15–19 August. Another massacre took place on 23 September, when 300 Armenians were killed.

In response to the Urfa resistance in October, Mehmet Celal Bey, who had served as governor of Aleppo before being sacked for refusing to comply with the order to deport the local Armenians, commented: &quot;Each human has the right to live. A trampled worm will squirm and wriggle. The Armenians will defend themselves.&quot; The final event of the resistance was on 15 October, when several thousand Turkish troops attacked their position. The next day, some 20,000 Armenian deportees in transit were killed in and around Urfa.

Meanwhile, during the Russian occupation of Western Armenia, many Turks fleeing those regions came and settled in Urfa. Mehmet Adil Saraç estimates that around 8 to 10 thousand Turks migrated to the Urfa region this way.

At the end of the First World War, the Treaty of Sèvres assigned Urfa to the French-controlled Mandate of Syria, 5 km south of the border with Turkey. As a result, Urfa was occupied by British and then French troops. Locals from Urfa formed a militia and successfully drove out the occupying troops on 11 April 1920. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne officially settled the matter by including Urfa as part of the new Republic of Turkey. Under the new republic, Urfa was made capital of the new Urfa Province on 20 April 1924.

===21st century===
During the Syrian Civil War, thousands of Syrian refugees fled to Turkey, and many of them settled in Urfa. When Raqqa became the capital of the Islamic State, Urfa became a gateway for jihadists entering Syria because of its closeness to the Akçakale-Tall Abyad border crossing and to Raqqa itself. The city&#x27;s general religious-conservative climate meant that many locals who adhere to Salafi thought sympathized with the Islamic State, and many of its members lived in the city as well.

On 6 February 2023, Urfa suffered some damage from the twin Turkey-Syria earthquakes.

==Geography==

Urfa is located at the border between the foothills of the Taurus Mountains and the great Mesopotamian plain. In general, these two regions meet &quot;well to the south&quot; of Urfa, but around Harran the plain extends northward, cutting into the hills. At the northwestern corner of the Harran plain, there is another extension in the plain, this time going westward. Urfa is located in this second extension of the plains, tucked behind the hills at its southern edge.

A small stream flows through Urfa. This stream is known as the Daisan, or &quot;leaping river&quot;, after its tendency for flooding. Today, the Daisan flows through a man-made channel that follows the north and east sides of the old walled city. Before the channel was made, though, the stream&#x27;s natural course was on the west side of the old city, then it turned east. Part of the former course survives as the fish pool called Birket Ibrahim, which tradition associates with the patriarch Abraham. To the south of the stream&#x27;s old course is a spring in a cave that is now converted into a mosque.

Since the 20th century, Urfa has expanded northward, across the little plain and the hill known as Şehitlik Mahallesi with blocks of flats, as well as over the escarpment to the south.

===Climate===
Urfa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Cs&quot;). During the summer months, average high temperatures often exceed and it has one of the hottest summers in the world among places that are not in arid or semi-arid regions, while rainfall is almost non-existent. Winters are cool and relatively wet, frost is common along with very sporadic snowfall. Spring and autumn are warm and moderately dry.

Highest recorded temperature: on 30 July 2000&lt;br&gt;Lowest recorded temperature: on 9 February 1932


==Main sights==

*Urfa castle – built in antiquity, the current walls were constructed by the Abbasids in 814 AD.
* The legendary Pool of Sacred Fish (&quot;Balıklıgöl&quot;) where Abraham was thrown into the fire by Nimrod. The pool is in the courtyard of the mosque of Halil-ur-Rahman, built by the Kurdish Ayyubids in 1211 and now surrounded by the attractive Gölbaşı-gardens designed by architect Merih Karaaslan. The courtyard is where the fishes thrive. A local legend says seeing a white fish will open the door to the heavens.
* Rızvaniye Mosque – a more recent (1716) Ottoman mosque, adjoining the Balıkligöl complex.
* &#x27;Ayn Zelîha – A source nearby the historical center, named after Zulaykha, a follower of Abraham.
* The Great Mosque of Urfa was built in 1170, on the site of a Christian church the Arabs called the &quot;Red Church&quot;, probably incorporating some Roman masonry. Contemporary tradition at the site identifies the well of the mosque as that into which the towel or burial cloth (&quot;mendil&quot;) of Jesus was thrown (see Image of Edessa and Shroud of Turin). In the south wall of the &quot;medrese&quot; adjoining the mosque is the fountain of Firuz Bey (1781).
* Ruins of the ancient city walls.
* Eight Turkish baths built in the Ottoman period.
* The traditional Urfa houses were split into sections for family (&quot;harem&quot;) and visitors (&quot;selâm&quot;). There is an example open to the public next to the post office in the district of Kara Meydan.
* The Temple of Nevali Çori – Neolithic settlement dating back to 8000BC, now buried under the Atatürk Reservoir, with some artefacts relocated above the waterline.
* Göbekli Tepe – The world&#x27;s oldest known temple, dated 10th millennium BC (ca 11,500 years ago).

===The citadel===
Urfa castle is located on the rocky heights south of the historical city center. It is long and thin because it crowns a ridge.

The hilltop was the site of an Abgarid winter palace built in the 3rd century; the two columns are the only remnant of this palace. The first known fortification of the site dates from the early 6th century, under the emperor Justinian. Fortifications may have existed here previously, but if they did then they went unrecorded.

The fortress was generally well-maintained during the middle ages, and it withstood a number of attacks. It was destroyed on the orders of the Ayyubid sultan al-Kamil around 1235. In the early 1300s, it was rebuilt under the Mamluk sultan an-Nasir Muhammad. It was further renovated under the Aq Qoyunlu in the 1400s, and then again under the Ottomans at various points: under Suleiman the Magnificent in the 1500s and then under Murad IV in the early 1600s.

Urfa&#x27;s castle was garrisoned with janissaries until their dissolution in 1826. It was already in serious disrepair by that point, though; only the part where the janissaries were posted was maintained at all. Afterwards, the citadel was essentially abandoned. In 1849, a local citizen named Sakıp Efendi dismantled part of the citadel and used the stones to build an inn and market; he also allegedly took a lot of stones to sell for money.

===Old city walls===
The monumental walls surrounding the old town date from the Abbasid-era rebuilding in 812. The only major repairs to them took place during the early Ottoman period, in 1660–61, when there was restoration work done on the city&#x27;s fortifications in general. The walls are made of large stone blocks over 30 cm tall all the way through (i.e. not just on the faces). The early Ottoman repairs are distinguished by their small size, white color, and light bossing. In many places, people have built private houses directly adjoining the city wall&#x27;s inner face, so that it forms one side of the house. Because of Urfa&#x27;s location, the east wall was always the most exposed to attack; large chunks of the surviving sections here consist of Ottoman repairs.

There were three known gates in the city walls: the Harran Gate; the Bey Kapısı, or &quot;Lord&#x27;s Gate&quot;; and the Saray Kapısı, or &quot;Palace Gate&quot;. The Harran Gate, located near the southeast corner of the walled city, still exists; its outer face (outside the walls) was rebuilt at some point, possibly during the Ottoman renovations of 1660–61. Its inner face, however, dates back to the Ayyubid period, under the local ruler Muzaffar Ghazi Shihab ad-Din (1230–45). The inscription recording his name runs almost from one end of the gatehouse to the other; below it, and above the top of the arch, is a small relief of a double-headed eagle.

The monumental Bey Kapısı, located on the east side of the old city, also still exists, although the actual gate no longer does. The original gatehouse was built in ancient times, perhaps during the 4th or 6th century. It probably had two large U-shaped towers with two or three gates in between them. Those two towers still exist today, although they were completely rebuilt over the centuries so that none of the original structures remain. The south tower kept its shape, but the north tower is now shaped like a polygon with straight sides. The entire gatehouse was turned into a fortress in the early middle ages. This may have happened during the Abbasid rebuilding of the city walls in 812, but in any case it had already happened by the early 11th century when sources refer to two castles in the city. The fortress consisted of a rectangular enclosure with the two towers on its east side; the north tower was probably rebuilt at this point. The fortress&#x27;s entire eastern wall appears to have been moved back by about 12 m and the old gates were closed up in the process. The new gate was built at the northwest corner of the fortress, between it and the main city wall, so that there was a passage between them. At some point, this passage was blocked up. The Armenian prince Toros appears to have begun a rebuilding of the Bey Kapısı fortress, as attested by an Armenian inscription on the south tower, but this project was only finished under the crusaders. Later, during the Ottoman renovations of 1660–61, the fortress was rebuilt again. In the mid-1800s, the entire fortress was converted into a private residence, and rebuilding from this period has replaced most of the earlier masonry in many places.

As for the Saray Kapısı, it no longer exists, but it was originally located behind the bridge that takes Atatürk Caddesi over the river on the north side of town.

===Balıklıgöl===
According to legend, Balıklıgöl was formed by the prophet Abraham&#x27;s confrontation with the tyrant Nimrod, who supposedly ruled over Urfa from the citadel above. When Abraham came of age, he destroyed Nimrod&#x27;s idols, and in retaliation Nimrod &quot;made a catapult out of the castle&#x27;s twin pillars&quot; and hurled Abraham into a pit of fire below. When Abraham landed, the flames miraculously turned into water, and the wood used to stoke the fire was turned into carp.

====Halil ür-Rahman Cami====

The Halil ür-Rahman Cami, also called simply the Halil Cami, is a mosque and medrese located on the south side of the pool. Just south of the mosque is a cave which according to legend is where the prophet Abraham was born. Another tradition says that Abraham intended to sacrifice his son Isaac here, but sacrificed a goat instead; when he did, a spring gushed out, feeding the fish pool.

The earliest part of the complex is the minaret, which was built in 1211–12 under Ayyubid rule. There was presumably a mosque with a prayer hall on the site of the present one, which was completely rebuilt in 1819–20 (but probably similar to the original one). The other major component is a series of medrese &quot;cells&quot;, fronted by a portico, which were built in 1808–09 and then renovated in 1871–72. The original Ayyubid complex may have been built to serve as a medrese, but by Ottoman times it was being used as a tekke with kitchens, reception rooms, and guest rooms, which may have been on the same site as the medrese cells. The tekke complex was converted into a medrese in the 1800s, possibly as soon as the medrese cells were built.

The mosque itself now serves as an antechamber where prayers can be said before entering the cave through a door on the south side. The mosque is entered through a domed vestibule on the west side. The prayer hall is a small squarish room with three aisles; two of them have groin-vaulted ceilings, while the middle one is topped with a dome. The mihrab is surrounded by an arch with squinches that seem to imitate Artukid style.

The minaret is a square tower that is visually divided into thirds by three molded cornices, one of which is at the very top. The upper level has pairs of mullioned windows on all four sides. The tops of the windows form horseshoe-shaped arches.

The medrese cells, now used as a Qur&#x27;an school, are elevated from the surrounding pavement. The cells are fronted by a portico with simple rounded arches. A balustrade with zigzag posts runs along the front of the portico. At the northwest corner of the pool is a five-sided room that projects out into the water on three sides. A restoration in the late 20th century extended the balustrade onto the top of the five-sided room.

====Ayn Zeliha====
The pool of Ayn Zeliha, named after Nimrod&#x27;s daughter, is located south of the main pool. It is shaded by trees and surrounded by cafés.

===Haleplibahçe museum complex===
The Haleplibahçe museum complex (Turkish: Haleplibahçe Müze Kompleksi) is located near Balıklıgöl and occupies a 40-hectare area. It consists of two museums: the Şanlıurfa Museum and the Haleplibahçe Mosaic Museum. The Şanlıurfa Museum was originally founded in 1965 and moved to its present location in 2015. With over 34,000 square meters of indoor space, it is the largest museum in Turkey. It has 14 exhibition halls and 33 animation areas and houses some 10,000 artefacts from the Paleolithic through Islamic times. This includes finds from Göbekli Tepe, Harran, and the areas now inundated by the Atatürk Dam. As for the Haleplibahçe Mosaic Museum, it was built &quot;in situ&quot; on the top of where the Haleplibahçe mosaics were originally found. Among the mosaics on display here is the oldest known mosaic to depict the Amazons.

===Kızılkoyun necropolis===

Just to the east of the Haleplibahçe museum complex is the Kızıllkoyun necropolis, where at least 75 rock-cut cave tombs were carved into a limestone ridge during the Roman period, in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The tombs vary in size and design based on the socioeconomic status of their occupants, ranging from one to three rooms and some having special front entrances. Some of the tombs were also decorated with statues and mosaics.

In the 1970s, the Kızılkoyun area became occupied by informal squatter housing, which was later legitimized through construction amnesty in the 1980s. Nearby sites were designated as protected monuments, but the Kızılkoyun necropolis was not designated as anything until 2008 when it was declared as a second-degree archaeological site. In 2012, the necropolis was officially registered as the Yenimahalle Urban Archaeological Site, and 387 houses and workplaces on the premises were demolished. A new landscaping project was commenced in 2015.

===Grand Mosque===

The 12th-century Grand Mosque of Urfa is a congregational mosque.

===Kapalı Çarşı===

The Kapalı Çarşı is a &quot;maze-like&quot; covered bazaar area at the south end of Divan Caddesi, not far from Balıklıgöl. Its narrow streets are lined with shops and stalls selling a wide variety of goods: herbs and spices, many different types of fabric, &quot;green Diyarbakır tobacco by the kilo&quot;, even guns. Household appliances are sometimes auctioned off here as well. The bazaar is covered are because of the climate: during the summer, the covers allow people to stay cool in the shade, while in winter they offer a bit of warmth.

The Kapalı Çarşı is one of the busiest shopping areas in the city; it serves locals and tourists as well as people coming from the surrounding villages to buy things in the city. It remains popular in spite of the increasing number of shopping malls in the city.

The Kapalı Çarşı is the most traditional marketplace in Urfa. Merchants gather and take part in a traditional prayer for &quot;good and fruitful gain&quot; two days per week when they open their shops as part of a &quot;traders&#x27; prayer&quot; that dates back to the culture of the Ahi guilds. Traditional artisans make goods for sale here, including shoes, saddles, and metal goods.

Among the bazaars located within the area: Kazaz (Bedesten), Sipahi Pazarı, Kınacı Pazarı, Bakırcılar Çarşısı (coppersmiths&#x27; market), Eskici Pazarı, Kuyumcular Çarşısı (jewellers&#x27; market), Kunduracılar Pazarı (shoemakers&#x27; market). The coppersmiths&#x27; bazaar is located south of the bedesten, along with the Haci Kamil Hanı, while the Sipahi Pazarı and the Hüseyniye bazaar are located further west. In the coppersmiths&#x27; and tin-beaters&#x27; quarter, there is &quot;a vaulted street with shops down either side.&quot;

====Gümrük Hanı====

The Gümrük Hanı, or &quot;customs caravanserai&quot;, is located in the middle of the Kapalı Çarşı. Variously dated to the late 16th century or the 18th or 19th centuries, it is a two-story building arranged around &quot;a more or less square courtyard&quot;. The ground floor is occupied by shops opening up onto the courtyard. Above the shops on the upper level is a portico with access to rooms now used as private apartments. The shady courtyard is filled with tables belonging to teahouses and watch repairers. Just next door to the Gümrük Hanı is a bedestan.

====Bedesten====

One of the most important markets in the Kapalı Çarşı is the bedesten, which is located just south of the Gümrük Hanı. Originally built in 1562, it is mentioned as &quot;bezzazistan&quot; in the waqf of Rızvan Ahmet Paşa in 1740. It was restored in 1998 by the Şanlıurfa Culture, Art, and Research Foundation (ŞURKAV). It has gates to 4 surrounding bazaars.

====Tabakhane Cami====
The Tabakhane Cami, or &quot;dye-house mosque&quot;, dates from the 1700s or early 1800s. Its minaret, however, may be older – perhaps from the 15th or 16th centuries. The mosque&#x27;s main prayer hall goes east-west, with a groin-vaulted portico on the north side. A rectangular courtyard surrounded by a high wall extends to the north. The main entrance to the whole complex is at the north end of the courtyard&#x27;s west side, where there is a high and deep porch covered by a high semi-dome. The minaret is located at the east end of the portico; the &quot;şerefe&quot; at the top features carved designs interspersed with turquoise tiles.

===Kara Meydanı===
The Kara Meydanı is located at the north end of Divan Caddesi; north of here it becomes Sarayönü Caddesi. The 19th-century Yusuf Paşa Cami is located here, as is the old Haci Hafiz Efendi house, which is now restored and turned into an art gallery.

== Parks ==
The Akabe recreation area (Akabe Mesire alanı), in Batıkent mahalle, covers 100,00 square meters and was implemented by the Metropolitan Municipality under mayor Zeynel Abidin Beyazgül under the slogan &quot;a greener Şanlıurfa&quot; (&quot;Daha yeşil bir Şanlıurfa&quot;); work completed as of December 2022. It has sports fields, playgrounds, walking trails, and an archery range.

== Religious significance ==
According to some Jewish and Muslim traditions, Urfa is Ur Kasdim, the hometown of Abraham, the grandfather of Jacob. This identification was disputed by Leonard Woolley, the excavator of the Sumerian city of Ur in 1927 and scholars remain divided on the issue. Urfa is also one of several cities that have traditions associated with Job.

For the Armenians, Urfa has &quot;great symbolic value&quot; since it is believed that the Armenian alphabet was invented there.

==Politics==
Urfa is a stronghold of the governing Justice and Development Party and is sometimes called a &quot;vote depot&quot; for the party.

From 2004 to 2014, Ahmet Eşref Fakıbaba served as mayor of Urfa for two terms. A popular figure in Urfa politics, Fakıbaba first rose to prominence as Chief Physician at the Şanlıurfa SSK Hospital, a role which he held for 11 years. In 2004 he ran as the AKP candidate in the mayoral election and won. The AKP did not nominate Fakıbaba as their mayoral candidate in the 2009 local elections, saying that they had 70% of the vote in Urfa and could win the election if their candidate was a jacket. However, Fakıbaba ran as an independent and won reelection to a second term. He later joined the Felicity Party before rejoining the AKP in 2013. In 2015, Fakıbaba was elected to the National Assembly as an AKP member, replacing previous Urfa MP Faruk Çelik. He later resigned as MP in 2022.

==Demographics==
===History===
The ethnic and religious demographics of the city have shifted over the centuries and were largely diverse. In ancient times, the region was mixed with Greeks, Arabs, Syrians, and Armenians. At the time of the First Crusade, the majority of the population were either Armenian or Assyrian.

There was an ancient Jewish community in Urfa, with about 1,000 people by the 19th century. Most of them emigrated in 1896, fleeing the Hamidian massacres, and settling mainly in Aleppo, Tiberias and Jerusalem. In 1910, Ely Bannister Soane wrote that apart from Turkish effendis, Urfa was populated by Arabs, Kurds and a large number of Armenians. British forces reported a mixed pre-war population of Kurds, Turks and 7,500 Armenians. The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople reported 25,000 to 30,000 Armenians in Urfa and its environs, on an overall population of 60,000. According to Agha Petros, there were 7,200 Syriacs in the city of Urfa, and 8,000 in ten surrounding villages. Joseph Tfinkdji reports 200 Chaldeans. According to 1918 reports of the Urfa mutasarrifate, there were 33,000 Turks, 27,000 Kurds, 12,000 Arabs, 5,500 Armenians, 3,000 Assyrians, and 500 Jews in the central kaza.

The Armenian and Assyrian Genocides, undertaken by Ottoman troops and Ottoman-sponsored militias such as the special organization, led to the slaughter, deportation, and ethnic cleansing of much of the Christian population of Urfa and the surrounding region. Following the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, most of the remaining non-Muslim population left the city due to continued persecution.

==== Language ====
In the early 19th century, the dominant language of the city was Turkish, while Armenian, Syriac, Kurdish, Arabic, and Persian were also spoken. Armenians were observed to speak Turkish to strangers, while Assyrians spoke Arabic.

=== Present-day ===
Today, the city is mainly composed of Arabs and Kurds as well as Turks.

==== Syrian refugees ====

Since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, large numbers of refugees from Syria have settled in Urfa because of its closeness to the border and opportunities for employment. As of 2017, as many as 300,000 Syrians live in Urfa, out of the total population of 750,000 in the province. As of 2014, about 79% of Syrian refugees in Urfa were Arabic-speakers, while the other 21% were Kurdish-speakers.

In general, Syrians in Urfa have clustered in areas where home rental prices are lower; typical rents range from 600 to 900 liras (as of 2019). These homes are often small, and often more than one nuclear family shares the same residence, so a 100-140-square-meter may accommodate 6–17 people. Syrians with the lowest incomes are most heavily concentrated in run-down neighborhoods with a lot of squatting that were previously inhabited mostly by poor people who had moved to Urfa from the countryside. Often, they are in outlying neighborhoods far from the city center. The largest number of Syrians in Urfa are in the Haliliye district, where they are especially concentrated in the neighborhoods (&quot;mahalle&quot;s) of Devteşti, Ahmet Yesevi, Süleymaniye, Bağlarbaşı, Şehitlik, Cengiz Topel, Şair Nabi, Yeşildirek, İpekyolu, Sancaktar, İmam Bakır and Yavuz Selim. The second-highest concentration is in Eyyübiye, whose neighborhoods (&quot;mahalle&quot;s) with the highest concentrations of Syrians are Eyyüpnebi, Hayati Harrani, Eyüpkent, Akşemsettin, Yenice, Muradiye, Direkli and Kurtuluş. In both cases, the Syrians here tend to prefer single-story residences where rents are not too high. The third urban district of Urfa, Karaköprü, has a much smaller Syrian presence. This area has been built up significantly in recent decades, with lots of luxury multi-story residences with high rents preferred by middle- and high-income residents. The Syrians who live here mostly had relatively high pre-war incomes. They are clustered in Maşuk, Karşıyaka, Akbayır and Şenevler. As of 2014, the largest concentrations of Syrians in the city were in the mahalles of Hayati Harrani (165 families), Bağlarbaşı (115), Devteşti (105), Ahmet Yesevi (91), and Eyyüpnebi (90 families).

Syrian refugees in Urfa often struggle with financial difficulties and unemployment. The language barrier hinders integration into the surrounding community, and many Syrians tend to form their own communities and interact less with Turkish locals. Many Syrians in Urfa run their own businesses; workplaces belonging to Syrian refugees are clustered around Şehit Nusret Caddesi and Atatürk Boulevard, Sarayönü and Divanyolu Streets, and Haşimiye Meydan. Many Syrians are also self-employed as street vendors, selling food, clothes, toys, and other items.

Before 2017, relations were relatively friendly between Syrians and Turks, but after 2017 relations began to deteriorate as there was a growing perception among Turks that Syrians were to blame for economic stagnation. The rapid increase in Syrian-owned businesses in Urfa, depressed wages for workers, and a perception that Syrians are &quot;cheap labor&quot; have all contributed to anti-Syrian sentiment among Turks. Some Turks also resent the fact that Syrian refugees have free access to healthcare and education. In July 2019, local authorities removed all Arabic-language signs on Syrian-owned businesses in Urfa and made Turkish-language signs mandatory.

== Economy ==
As of 2018, the average per capita income in Urfa is $4,400 USD per year. As of 2018, unemployment in Urfa is 18%, among young people it is 35%.

Urfa is a center of footwear production in the region, and around 5,000 people are employed in this sector. The Istanbul-based shoe retailer FLO, owned by the Ziylan Group, opened a shoe factory in Urfa in 2012. As of 2018, this factory employed 900 people and was the largest footwear factory in the region, producing 1.8 million pairs of shoes per year. FLO was planning to open a second factory, employing 1,500 more people, in the city in early 2019. According to the province governor Abdullah Erin, there were also plans to open some 13 more shoe factories in the Organized Industrial Zone by 2023, employing as many as 20,000 people and producing 30 million pairs of shoes annually.

Urfa is a major producer of pistachio nuts, with 29.7 million trees in the whole province producing 38,576 tons of pistachios in 2021. However, most processing is done in Gaziantep, which is the other main pistachio producer in Turkey. Both cities&#x27; pistachios have geographical indications under different names for different cultivars, with Urfa&#x27;s officially known as the &quot;Urfa flax village pistachio&quot; (&quot;Urfa keten köyneği fıstığı&quot;).

===Handicrafts===
Urfa has a rich tradition of handicrafts: coppersmiths, furriers, weavers and carpetmakers, felt makers, saddle makers, and jewelers all form part of this tradition. Historically, the various trades had their own bazaars where artisans sold their wares. In the 21st century, however, these handicrafts have been on the decline, and new generations are generally not learning them.

Copper-smithing is relatively prosperous among Urfa&#x27;s handicrafts, although demand has fallen in favor of more contemporary décor. Many coppersmiths have left the profession altogether, and those who remain often face declining incomes. Jewelry making also remains a thriving business; its continued importance is partly because of traditional wedding customs that are still practiced. The making of prayer beads (&quot;tespih&quot;) also continues in Urfa, with craftsmen working particularly around the Gümrük Han and the shopping areas around Balıklıgöl. Woodcarvers, although few in number, are still in demand for restoration of old buildings. A few furriers and saddle makers also continue to ply their trades in the city.

Artisanal leather tanning, on the other hand, is no longer practiced in Urfa, and new apprentices are not taught. Professionals now send the hides to industrial-scale leather factories instead. Commercial production of handmade embroidery has also ceased in Urfa, although many women continue the craft for dowry purposes.

=== Limestone quarrying ===

There is an abundance of limestone in the Urfa area, and it has been quarried extensively since ancient times for use as a building material. This limestone, known as Urfa limestone, was mostly deposited in Eocene through Miocene times (about 56-5 million years ago).
It has a light, whitish-yellow ochre color. When freshly extracted from the quarry and still rather moist, Urfa limestone is relatively soft and can easily be cut with a handheld saw. Once exposed to the atmosphere, though, its surface gradually hardens so that it makes a suitably strong building material.

Urfa limestone has been quarried for human use since at least the Neolithic period: it was the main building material used at Göbekli Tepe, 12,000 years ago, and the prehistoric quarries and workshops at Göbekli Tepe are among the oldest in the world. On the southern edge of the rocky plateau, there are also traces of quarries dating back to ancient Roman times. Many old quarries in the area were also dug underground, forming artificial caves. The oldest of this type is the massive 4-story Basda quarry, although its precise age is unknown.

A number of active limestone quarries exist today in the Urfa area. Much of the quarrying is done just west of the city, around the Evren Industrial Estate.

Şanlıurfa province&#x27;s total limestone reserves amount to 62.2 million tons, and its industry has an annual processing capacity of 31,680 tons. Many of the stone blocks quarried from the Urfa area are sent to Mardin and Midyat for processing.

Before the introduction of reinforced concrete structures, Urfa limestone was the main building material used for &quot;major&quot; construction projects in the area. Many historical structures in the city were built with this limestone: the castle and city walls, the Ulu Cami, the Halil ür-Rahman and Rızvaniye mosques, and the Gümrük Hanı, as well as many of the old 18th- and 19th-century houses in the old town. It is also used in many contemporary buildings, such as the Mevlana mosque complex. Especially since the start of the GAP in the 1980s, regional demand for Urfa limestone as a construction material has been increasing, particularly since it is cheaper than reinforced concrete. It is also commonly used in combination with other building materials, such as aerated concrete and pumice blocks. In addition to being used as a building block, Urfa limestone is also used for cladding on the outside of walls, as well as decorative finishing on indoor walls. Its use is mostly regional; it is not used much outside the area.

===Industrial zones===
====Organized Industrial Zone====
The Organized Industrial Zone (Turkish: Organize Sanayi Bölgesi) is located 17 km west of central Urfa on the highway to Gaziantep. Construction started in 1991. The site consists of three areas covering over 1,700 hectares as of 2018. It is home to about 250 companies and employs about 13,000 people.

====Evren Industrial Estate====
The Evren Industrial Estate (Turkish: Evren Sanayi Sitesi) is a Small Industrial Site located about 7 km west of central Urfa on the highway to Gaziantep. It covers about 140 hectares and is home to about 1500 businesses. It became operational in 1994. Urfa&#x27;s limestone quarries are also clustered around here.

== Culture ==
=== Cuisine ===

As the city of Urfa is deeply rooted in history, so its unique cuisine is an amalgamation of the cuisines of the many civilizations that have ruled in Urfa . It is widely believed that Urfa is the birthplace of many dishes, including Çiğ köfte, that according to the legend, was crafted by the Prophet Abraham from ingredients he had at hand.

Meat-based dishes are a staple of everyday meals in Urfa. There is a local saying, &quot;There is no trouble where meat comes in&quot; (Turkish: &quot;et giren yere dert girmez&quot;). Foods like lahmacun and kebab are consumed daily by many people. &quot;Ciğer kebabı&quot;, or liver kebab, is especially popular among poorer Urfalis, since liver is usually a relatively cheap meat. Liver kebab is popularly eaten for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

The walnut-stuffed Turkish dessert crepe (called &quot;şıllık&quot;) is a regional specialty. According to legend, its sweet syrup was first made using molasses from the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

=== Hospitality ===
Urfali society traditionally places a great value on hospitality, and inviting guests over and sharing food with them has a special importance. Locals attribute this to the prophet Abraham, who according to legend never dined alone — he always had guests over to share his meals with. The locally common epithet &quot;Halil İbrahim Sofrası&quot; (&quot;the tablecloth-like&quot;) depicts this characterization.

=== Literature ===
Urfa has a long history of literature, going back to early Christian writers such as Bardaisan and Ibas of Edessa. A prominent medieval writer from Urfa was the 9th century Arabic author al-Ruhawi, whose &quot;Adab al-Tabib&quot; covered the topic of medical ethics. Later, from the 1600s to the 20th century, &quot;divan&quot; poetry became popular in Urfa. The popularity of divan poetry in Urfa is unusual because, by the 1600s, Urfa was not a major center of learning that would typically be expected to produce a lot of poetry. In all, 130 different Urfali poets are known from this period. A few of them are Nâbî, Ömer Nüzhet, Admî, Fehim, Hikmet, Şevket, Sakıb, and Emin. Many of them were Sufis, affiliated with orders like the Bektashis, Mevlevis, Naqshbandis, Qadiris, and Rifa&#x27;is; they gathered in places like the Hasanpaşa Medrese, the İhlasiye Medrese, the Hasan Paşa Medrese, the Sakıbiye Tekke, the Halil’ür Rahman Medrese, the Rızvaniye Medrese, the Dabbakhane Medrese, and the Eyyübî Medrese. Urfali divan poets almost exclusively used the ghazala form, with almost no known examples of the qasida.

=== Traditional house architecture ===
Urfa&#x27;s old town has many old courtyard houses; many were built during a construction boom in the 19th century. A typical Urfa courtyard house is centered around a high-walled courtyard that is closed to the street. Facing the courtyard is a porticoed antechamber covered by a roof and partially surrounded by three walls. In Urfa, the name for this space is &quot;mastaba&quot;; elsewhere, the more general term is &quot;iwan&quot;. Other typical rooms include bedrooms, a kitchen (&quot;tandir&quot;), a sitting room, or a water closet. There is also a semi-basement called the &quot;zerzembe&quot;, which is used for winter food storage and is practically omnipresent in traditional Turkish homes in regions with hot climates. The house as a whole, with its courtyard, mastaba, and other rooms, forms one integrated living space rather than each room being its own &quot;isolated, independent&quot; space.
An important consideration in domestic architecture is &quot;mahremiyat&quot;, which could roughly be translated into English as &quot;privacy&quot; or &quot;intimacy&quot; but which carries stronger implications. This concept is especially important when it comes to relations between men and women – outside the extended family, interaction between men and women is restricted. As a result, traditional Urfa houses are constructed in ways to prevent men outside from viewing the women of the household. For example, doors facing each other, windows facing the street, and significant differences in roof elevation are all avoided.

=== Local Turkish dialect ===
The Turkish spoken in Urfa has some features in common with the variety of Iraqi Turkmen spoken in Kirkuk, as well as some features owed to Arabic influence. For example, the Arabic sounds &quot;&#x27;ayn&quot;, &quot;ghayn&quot;, and &quot;qāf&quot; are pronounced the same in Urfa as they are in Arabic, which is not done in standard Turkish.

== Education ==
=== Harran University ===
Harran University was established in Urfa in 1992 as an amalgamation of several different faculties that had previously been attached to two different universities.

=== Former vocational schools ===
==== Mekteb-i Sanayi ====
By 1906, the presence of a vocational school in Urfa called the Mekteb-i Sanayi is attested. It was used as a hospital for wounded fighters during the Turkish War of Independence. This school stayed open after the war and is attested again in 1927, by then under the name of Urfa Male Industry School (Urfa Erkek Sanayi Mektebi). This school&#x27;s building was demolished in the late 1930s and the Halkevi building was built on its site.

==== Urfa Girls&#x27; Institute ====
The Urfa Girls&#x27; Institute (Turkish: &quot;Urfa Kız Enstıtüsü&quot;), which opened in 1942, was an early vocational school teaching practical trades and general subjects to girls and young women.

==== Urfa Institute of Art for Boys ====
The boys&#x27; equivalent to the Girls&#x27; Institute was Urfa Institute of Art for Boys (Turkish: &quot;Urfa Erkek Sanat Enstıtüsü&quot;), which provided vocational education to boys aged 12 to 17.

== Health ==
=== Old state hospital ===
The old state hospital in Urfa was established by Ethem Bey in 1903 and became a public hospital in 1943. This hospital eventually came to comprise four different buildings, serving as the A, B, C, and D blocks. The A-block building, which was three stories tall, opened in 1962 and was originally dedicated to treatment of tuberculosis. The B-block building opened in 1972 and had 200 beds. The D block was for emergency care. Demolition of the old state hospital, which was located in Atatürk &quot;mahalle&quot; of Haliliye district, was completed in 2022. At the time of the demolition, the provincial health directorate was planning to build a new 150-bed children&#x27;s hospital on the site.

=== Şanlıurfa Balıklıgöl State Hospital ===
The Şanlıurfa Balıklıgöl State Hospital (Şanlıurfa Balıklıgöl Devlet Hastanesi) was established in 1963 as a &quot;Health Station&quot; (Sağlık İstasyonu), and then became a dispensary in 1975. In July 1983, it became the Şanlıurfa SSK Hastanesi and was operating as an inpatient facility with 150 beds. In addition, a 5-story outpatient department building began construction in 1991 and then became operational in 1994. It was renamed in 2005 to its current name.

=== Şanlıurfa Training and Research Hospital ===
The Training and Research Hospital (Şanlıurfa Eğitim Ve Araştırma Hastanesi) was established in 1973 with 125 beds. Originally, it was a branch hospital under the State Hospital, until 1984. From 1984 until 2004, it was a gynecology and pediatric hospital, and in 2004 it was split in two: the gynecology and obstetric hospital, which remained in the same building, and the pediatric hospital, which moved into the old State Hospital building. In 2016, the two branch hospitals were combined together into the Training and Research Hospital in the current building due to a shortage of beds. The current building, as of 2019, covers over 100,000 square meters and has 400 patient rooms (with separate beds and restrooms), 18 operating rooms (2 of which are set aside for &quot;maternity emergencies&quot;), a 180-person conference hall, and an 80-person training hall, as well as a helipad and a parking lot with 1,200 spaces. The hospital covers gynecology, pediatric, and adult healthcare.

=== Mehmet Akif İnan Training and Research Hospital ===
The Mehmet Akif İnan Training and Research Hospital (Mehmet Akif İnan Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesi) opened in 2004 and handles as many as 3,500 to 6,000 patient applicants per day. It has 500 beds (rooms have 1, 2, or 3 beds, as well as their own restrooms) and a conference hall that can seat 156 people. There is a blood center, a dialysis unit, and an intensive care unit, as well as a physical therapy unit for outpatients.

==Transport==
Şanlıurfa GAP Airport is located about 34 km (21 mi) northeast of the city and has direct flights to Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. The main highway from Gaziantep to Diyarbakır now bypasses Urfa on the northwest.

Construction of the first phase of a planned four-route, 78 km network of trolleybus lines began in late 2017, and the first of 10 bi-articulated trolleybuses built by manufacturer Bozankaya was received in September 2018. However, work on additional vehicles was suspended because of various problems, and in 2020 the single vehicle delivered in 2018 remained the only trolleybus completed. In late 2020, the original order for 10 bi-articulated vehicles was replaced by one for 12 standard-articulated vehicles, and the first of these was delivered in April 2022. The trolleybus line opened for service on 28 April 2023, by which time six of the 12 vehicles had been received. However, because of earthquake damage to certain streets in February 2023, among other factors, several temporary changes were made to the planned route after completion of the overhead wiring and other infrastructure such that, after the line&#x27;s opening, the vehicles initially operated as trolleybuses on only about 600 metres of the now-7.1-km route. The trolleybuses are able to operate on battery power on sections of the route that are not equipped with overhead wires and recharge their batteries during an extended layover at the terminus. By July 2024, following repairs to the earthquake-damaged streets, the trolleybus service finally began following the originally planned route, which is equipped with overhead wires over most sections. Numbered 63, the route begins at Emirgan Aktarma Merkezi.

<text>Supercooling, also known as undercooling, is the process of lowering the temperature of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming a solid. Per the established international definition, supercooling means &quot;‘cooling a substance below the normal freezing point without solidification’.&quot; While it can be achieved by different physical means, the postponed solidification is most often due to the absence of seed crystals or nuclei around which a crystal structure can form. The supercooling of water can be achieved without any special techniques other than chemical demineralization, down to . Supercooled water can occur naturally, for example in the atmosphere, animals or plants.

==Explanation==
A liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid. Lacking any such nuclei, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.

Homogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature, but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid will form.

Water normally freezes at , but it can be &quot;supercooled&quot; at standard pressure down to its crystal homogeneous nucleation at almost . The process of supercooling requires water to be pure and free of nucleation sites, which can be achieved by processes like reverse osmosis or chemical demineralization, but the cooling itself does not require any specialised technique. If water is cooled at a rate on the order of 106 K/s, the crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a glass—that is, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid. Its glass transition temperature is much colder and harder to determine, but studies estimate it at about .
Glassy water can be heated up to approximately without nucleation occurring.
In the range of temperatures between , experiments find only crystal ice.

Droplets of supercooled water often exist in stratus and cumulus clouds. An aircraft flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets, which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft&#x27;s wings or blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate ice protection system. Freezing rain is also caused by supercooled droplets.

The process opposite to supercooling, the melting of a solid above the freezing point, is much more difficult, and a solid will almost always melt at the same temperature for a given pressure. For this reason, it is the melting point which is usually identified, using melting point apparatus; even when the subject of a paper is &quot;freezing-point determination&quot;, the actual methodology is &quot;the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice&quot;. It is possible, at a given pressure, to superheat a liquid above its boiling point without it becoming gaseous.

Supercooling should not be confused with freezing-point depression. Supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid. Freezing point depression is when a solution can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the solute; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when salt is added to pure water.

==Constitutional supercooling==
Constitutional supercooling, which occurs during solidification, is due to compositional solid changes, and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the solid–liquid interface. When solidifying a liquid, the interface is often unstable, and the velocity of the solid–liquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercooling.

Constitutional supercooling is observed when the liquidus temperature gradient at the interface (the position x=0) is larger than the imposed temperature gradient:

: formula_1

The liquidus slope from the binary phase diagram is given by formula_2, so the constitutional supercooling criterion for a binary alloy can be written in terms of the concentration gradient at the interface:

: formula_3

The concentration gradient ahead of a planar interface is given by

: formula_4

where formula_5 is the interface velocity, formula_6 the diffusion coefficient, and formula_7 and formula_8 are the compositions of the liquid and solid at the interface, respectively (i.e., formula_9).

For the steady-state growth of a planar interface, the composition of the solid is equal to the nominal alloy composition, formula_10, and the partition coefficient, formula_11, can be assumed constant. Therefore, the minimum thermal gradient necessary to create a stable solid front is given by

: formula_12

==In animals==
In order to survive extreme low temperatures in certain environments, some animals use the phenomenon of supercooling that allow them to remain unfrozen and avoid cell damage and death. There are many techniques that aid in maintaining a liquid state, such as the production of antifreeze proteins, or AFPs, which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice. The winter flounder is one such fish that utilizes these proteins to survive in its frigid environment. The liver secretes noncolligative proteins into the bloodstream. Other animals use colligative antifreezes, which increases the concentration of solutes in their bodily fluids, thus lowering their freezing point. Fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface, because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately. Animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing. Supercooling is also a common feature in some insect, reptile, and other ectotherm species. The potato cyst nematode larva (&quot;Globodera rostochiensis&quot;) could survive inside their cysts in a supercooled state to temperatures as low as , even with the cyst encased in ice.

As an animal gets farther and farther below its melting point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids, as this is a thermodynamically unstable state. The fluids eventually reach the supercooling point, which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing point. Animals unintentionally undergo supercooling and are only able to decrease the odds of freezing once supercooled. Even though supercooling is essential for survival, there are many risks associated with it.

==In plants==
Plants can also survive extreme cold conditions brought forth during the winter months. Many plant species located in northern climates can acclimate under these cold conditions by supercooling, thus these plants survive temperatures as low as . Although this supercooling phenomenon is poorly understood, it has been recognized through infrared thermography. Ice nucleation occurs in certain plant organs and tissues, debatably beginning in the xylem tissue and spreading throughout the rest of the plant. Infrared thermography allows for droplets of water to be visualized as they crystalize in extracellular spaces.

Supercooling inhibits the formation of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular ice. Cellular barriers such as lignin, suberin and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled tissue. The xylem and primary tissue of plants are very susceptible to cold temperatures because of the large proportion of water in the cell. Many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the cold. Supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs &quot;Rhododendron ferrugineum&quot; and &quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot; as well as &quot;Abies&quot;, &quot;Picea&quot; and &quot;Larix&quot; species. Freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the plant. However, the extracellular ice may lead to plant dehydration.

==In seawater==
The presence of salt in seawater affects the freezing point. For that reason, it is possible for seawater to remain in the liquid state at temperatures below melting point. This is &quot;pseudo-supercooling&quot; because the phenomenon is the result of freezing point lowering caused by the presence of salt, not supercooling. This condition is most commonly observed in the oceans around Antarctica where melting of the undersides of ice shelves at high-pressure results in liquid melt-water that can be below the freezing temperature. It is supposed that the water does not immediately refreeze due to a lack of nucleation sites. This provides a challenge to oceanographic instrumentation as ice crystals will readily form on the equipment, potentially affecting the data quality. Ultimately the presence of extremely cold seawater will affect the growth of sea ice.

==Applications==
One commercial application of supercooling is in refrigeration. Freezers can cool drinks to a supercooled level so that when they are opened, they form a slush. Another example is a product that can supercool the beverage in a conventional freezer. The Coca-Cola Company briefly marketed special vending machines containing Sprite in the UK, and Coke in Singapore, which stored the bottles in a supercooled state so that their content would turn to slush upon opening.

Supercooling was successfully applied to organ preservation at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Livers that were later transplanted into recipient animals were preserved by supercooling for up to 4 days, quadrupling the limits of what could be achieved by conventional liver preservation methods. The livers were supercooled to a temperature of in a specialized solution that protected against freezing and injury from the cold temperature.

Another potential application is drug delivery. In 2015, researchers crystallized membranes at a specific time. Liquid-encapsulated drugs could be delivered to the site and, with a slight environmental change, the liquid rapidly changes into a crystalline form that releases the drug.

In 2016, a team at Iowa State University proposed a method for &quot;soldering without heat&quot; by using encapsulated droplets of supercooled liquid metal to repair heat sensitive electronic devices. In 2019, the same team demonstrated the use of undercooled metal to print solid metallic interconnects on surfaces ranging from polar (paper and Jello) to superhydrophobic (rose petals), with all the surfaces being lower modulus than the metal.

Eftekhari et al. proposed an empirical theory explaining that supercooling of ionic liquid crystals can build ordered channels for diffusion for energy storage applications. In this case, the electrolyte has a rigid structure comparable to a solid electrolyte, but the diffusion coefficient can be as large as in liquid electrolytes. Supercooling increases the medium viscosity but keeps the directional channels open for diffusion.

<text>Richard Mulligan (November 13, 1932 – September 26, 2000) was an American character actor. He was known for his roles in the sitcoms &quot;Soap&quot; (1977–1981) and &quot;Empty Nest&quot; (1988–1995). Mulligan was the winner of two Emmy Awards (1980 and 1989) and one Golden Globe Award (1989). He was the younger brother of film director Robert Mulligan.

==Early life and career==
Mulligan was born on November 13, 1932, in New York City. He served in the Navy in the early 1950s during the Korean War and later studied to become a playwright at Columbia University. After college, he began working in theatre, making his debut as a stage manager and performer on Broadway in &quot;All the Way Home&quot; in 1960. Additional theatre credits included &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, &quot;Never Too Late&quot;, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Goat&quot;, and &quot;Thieves&quot;.

Mulligan made a brief, uncredited appearance in the 1963 film &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot;, which was directed by his elder brother. He starred with Mariette Hartley in the 1966–67 season comedy series &quot;The Hero&quot;, in which he played TV star Sam Garrett. Garrett had starred in a fictional series as Jed Clayton, U.S. Marshal. &quot;The Hero&quot; lasted for 16 episodes. Another notable TV appearance was on the &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; episode &quot;Around the World in 80 Blinks&quot;, as a navy commander accompanying Major Nelson (Larry Hagman) on a mission. He also appeared in the season-13 episode &quot;Wonder&quot; of the Western TV show &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He also was in an episode of &quot;The Rat Patrol&quot;, 1967.

==1970s to end of career==
Mulligan&#x27;s most notable film role was as General George Armstrong Custer in &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, whom he portrayed as a borderline psychotic. He also appeared in the disaster movie spoof, &quot;The Big Bus&quot; (1976), where he was reunited with Larry Hagman from &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and in the 1966 film &quot;The Group&quot;, in which he played Dick Brown, Harold&#x27;s (Hagman) New York artist friend. In 1975, he starred in a radio adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Oblong Box&quot; heard on the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;.
Mulligan&#x27;s best-known roles in television were as Burt Campbell in the sitcom &quot;Soap&quot; (1977–81), for which he won a Best Actor Emmy Award, and as Dr. Harry Weston in the NBC series &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in which his character had appeared in a couple of episodes. &quot;Empty Nest&quot; ran for seven seasons, and Mulligan won a Best Actor Emmy Award as well as a Golden Globe Award for his performance. He also played Secretary of State William Seward in &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1988), a TV movie based on Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel.

Mulligan returned to perform on Broadway and in films, in which he usually played supporting roles. A notable exception was the black comedy &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981), in which he played a leading character, Felix Farmer, a Hollywood producer-director based upon the film&#x27;s actual producer-director, Blake Edwards. The film starred Julie Andrews and William Holden, and also featured Larry Hagman. 
Mulligan was cast as Reggie Potter in the television series &quot;Reggie&quot; (1983). Lasting for only six episodes, it was a loose adaptation of the popular BBC series &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;. In the 1984 film &quot;Teachers&quot;, he played an eccentric high-school history teacher (who in one scene teaches the Battle of the Little Bighorn, once more dressed as General Custer).

In 1985, he guest-appeared &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Night of the Meek&quot;, where he took on the role of Henry Corwin, an alcoholic department-store Santa Claus who becomes the genuine article, in the remake of the 1959 Christmas episode &quot;The Night of the Meek&quot;, the character Art Carney had played in the original version. The next year, he appeared in another episode of the series, &quot;The Toys of Caliban&quot;.

Mulligan lent his voice to Disney&#x27;s 1988 animated film, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, as the oafish Great Dane named Einstein. His final performance was a voice-over on &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; in 2000 as the voice of Jimmy Kafka, the long mentioned, but never seen former friend of Arnold&#x27;s grandpa.

==Marriages==
Mulligan married four times. He was first married to Patricia Jones from 1955 to 1960. That was followed by marriages to Joan Hackett from January 3, 1966, to June 1973 and Lenore Stevens from 1978 to 1990. His last marriage was to adult film actress Rachel Ryan on April 27, 1992, which lasted only six months.

==Death==
On September 26, 2000, Mulligan died of colorectal cancer at his home in Los Angeles. He was 67 years old. At his own request, his remains were cremated.

== Recognition ==
In 1989, Mulligan won both the Emmy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for portraying Dr. Harry Weston in &quot;Empty Nest&quot; (1988–1995). On September 30, 1993, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in the television industry, located at 6777 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>A derringer or deringer is a small handgun that is neither a revolver, semi-automatic pistol, nor machine pistol. It is not to be confused with mini-revolvers or pocket pistols, although some later derringers were manufactured with the pepperbox configuration. The modern derringer is often multi barreled, and is generally the smallest usable handgun of any given caliber and barrel length due to the lack of a moving action, which takes up more space behind the barrel. It is frequently used by women because it is easily concealable in a purse or a stocking.

The original Philadelphia Deringer was a muzzleloading caplock single-shot pistol introduced in 1825 by Henry Deringer. In total, approximately 15,000 Deringer pistols were manufactured. All were single-barrel pistols with back-action percussion locks, typically .41 caliber with rifled bores and walnut stocks. Barrel length varied from , and the hardware was commonly a copper-nickel alloy known as &quot;German silver&quot;.

==Spelling==
The term &quot;derringer&quot; () became a genericized misspelling during the reporting of the Lincoln assassination, which was committed with a concealed Philadelphia Deringer. Many copies of the original Philadelphia Deringer pistol were made by other gunmakers worldwide, and the name remained often misspelled; this misspelling soon became an alternative generic term for any pocket pistol, along with the generic phrase &quot;palm pistol&quot;, which Deringer&#x27;s competitors invented and used in their advertising. With the advent of metallic cartridges, pistols produced in the modern form are still commonly called &quot;derringers&quot;.

==Precursors==
The ancestor to the deringer of the Old West was the boxlock overcoat pistol used by travelers from the late 18th century onward as protection from highwaymen. These were also known as boot pistols, Toby pistols, manstopper pistols, vest pocket pistols, and muff pistols because they could be concealed in a woman’s hand-warmer muff. Originally made as flintlocks, later versions used cap and ball ignition and sometimes featured turn-off barrels for faster reloading. Double-barreled caplock pocket pistols, commonly known as twister pistols, became popular in England during the Regency era and also saw use among Union Army officers during the American Civil War. These served as the forerunner to the Old West gambler&#x27;s over-and-under deringer and also to the pepperbox revolver with the addition of a ratchet to mechanically rotate the barrels.
==Philadelphia Deringer==
The Philadelphia Deringer was a small percussion handgun designed by Henry Deringer (1786–1868) and produced from 1825 through 1868. A popular concealed carry handgun of the era, this pocket pistol design was widely copied by competitors, sometimes down to the markings.

For loading a Philadelphia Deringer, one would typically fire a couple of percussion caps on the handgun, to dry out any residual moisture contained in the tube or at the base of the barrel, to prevent a subsequent misfire. One would then remove the remains of the last fired percussion cap and place the handgun on its half-cock notch, pour of black powder down the barrel, followed by ramming a patched lead ball down onto the powder, being very careful to leave no air gap between the patched ball and the powder, to prevent the handgun from exploding when used. (The purpose of the patch on the ball was to keep the ball firmly lodged against the powder, to avoid creating what was called a &quot;short start&quot; when the ball was dislodged from being firmly against the powder.)

A new percussion cap would then be placed on the tube (nipple), and the gun was then loaded and ready to fire. (The half-cock notch prevented the hammer from falling if the trigger was bumped accidentally.) Then, to fire the handgun, the user would fully cock the hammer, aim, and squeeze the trigger. Upon a misfire, the user could fully re-cock the hammer, and attempt to fire the handgun once more, or switch to a second Deringer. Accuracy was highly variable; although front sights were common, rear sights were less common, and some Philadelphia Deringers had no sights at all, being intended for point-and-shoot use instead of aim and shoot, across poker-table distances. Professional gamblers, and others who carried regularly, would often fire and reload daily, to decrease the chance of a misfire.

Deringer&#x27;s production records, and contemporaneous records of his imitators, indicate that these pistols were almost always sold in matching pairs. (A typical price was $15 to $25 for a pair, with silver-inlaid and engraved models selling at higher prices.) The choice of buying a pair, in part, was to compensate for the limited power of a single-shot, short-barreled pistol, and to compensate for a design considerably less reliable than subsequent cartridge derringer designs. Original Deringers are almost never found still in their matched pairs today.

Initially popular with military officers, the Deringer became widely popular among civilians who wished to own a small and easily concealable pistol for self-defense. In the Old West, derringers were commonly known as vest-pocket pistols, sleeve guns, and boot pistols.

In total, approximately 15,000 Deringer pistols were manufactured. All were single-barrel pistols with back action percussion locks, typically rifled bores, and walnut stocks. Barrel length varied from , and the hardware was commonly a copper-nickel alloy known as &quot;German silver&quot;. The back action lock was a later, improved design among locks, which had its spring and mechanism located behind the hammer, where it was thereby protected from dirt, fired cap residue, and gunpowder residue, unlike earlier front action locks that had their springs and mechanism located directly in the path of such residue in front of the hammer, under the tube.

Because of their small size and easy availability, Deringers sometimes had the dubious reputation of being a favored tool of assassins. The most famous Deringer used for this purpose was fired by John Wilkes Booth who assassinated United States President Abraham Lincoln at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. Booth&#x27;s Deringer was unusual in that the rifling twisted counterclockwise (left-handed twist), rather than the typical clockwise twist.


== Colt Deringer ==

Daniel Moore patented a single-shot metallic cartridge .38 Rimfire pistol in 1861. These pistols had barrels that pivoted sideways on the frame to allow access to the breech for reloading. Moore would manufacture them until 1865 when he sold out to the National Arms Company, which produced single-shot .41 Rimfire Deringers until 1870 when it was acquired by Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company. Colt continued to produce the .41 Rimfire Deringer after the acquisition, as an effort to help break into the metallic-cartridge gun market, but also introduced its own three single-shot Colt Deringer models, all of them also chambered in the .41 Rimfire cartridge. The last model in production, the third Colt Deringer, was produced until 1912, and later re-released in the 1950s for western movies, under the name &quot;Fourth Model Colt Deringer&quot;.

== Sharps Deringer ==
One of the more common deringers found in the Old West were the Sharps deringers. They are four-barrel, single-action pepperboxes with revolving firing pins. They come in .22, .30 and .32 rimfire, and their four barrels slide forward to load and unload. First patented in 1849, they were not made until 1859, when Sharps patented a practical derringer design. These first model deringers have brass frames and fired the recently introduced .22 Rimfire metallic cartridges. The second model was a .30 Rimfire deringer. The third model deringer was a .32 Rimfire, with an iron frame, and the barrel release was moved from under the frame to the left side of the frame. The fourth model deringer was also a .32 Rimfire, with a new &quot;birdshead&quot; grip and slightly shorter barrels, otherwise, it was virtually identical to the third model. Production of these little pistols came to an end with the death of Christian Sharps in 1874.
== Remington Deringers ==

Remington Arms manufactured more than 150,000 Model 95 over-under double-barreled derringers, also called the &quot;Model 95 Double Deringer&quot;, from 1866 until the end of their production in 1935. The gun was made only in .41 rimfire. The Remington derringer design doubled the capacity while maintaining a compact size, by adding a second barrel on top of the first and pivoting the barrels upward to reload. Each barrel chambered one round, and a cam on the hammer alternated between the top and bottom barrels. There were four models with several variations. The .41 Short bullet moved very slowly, at about , around half the speed of a modern .45 ACP.

Remington also constructed the .32 short Rimfire &quot;Rider Magazine Repeating&quot; pistol. The magazine tube under the barrel held five rounds of ammunition, plus one in the chamber. Muzzle velocity was between with a .32 bullet. This particular model featured a hammer that also drew back the breach block and lifted a new cartridge out of the magazine upon cocking. Relaxing one&#x27;s grip on the hammer closed the breech block, but left the hammer cocked.
== FP-45 Liberator ==
A military pistol that is a deringer design is the FP-45 Liberator, a .45 ACP insurgency weapon dropped behind Axis lines in World War II. The FP-45 was a crude, single-shot pistol designed to be cheaply and quickly mass produced. It had just 23 largely stamped and turned steel parts that were cheap and easy to manufacture. It fired a .45 caliber pistol cartridge from an unrifled barrel. Due to this limitation, it was intended for short-range use () either as a last-ditch self-defense gun or to sneak up on and kill an unsuspecting Axis soldier to steal a more serviceable weapon. Its maximum effective range was only about . At longer range, the bullet would begin to tumble and stray off course. Five extra rounds of ammunition could be stored in the pistol grip. The original delivered cost for the FP-45 was $2.10 per unit, lending it the nickname &quot;Woolworth pistol&quot;.
== Modern designs ==
While the classic Remington design is a single-action deringer with a hammer and tip-up action, the High Standard D-100, introduced in 1962, is a hammer-less, double-action derringer with a half-trigger-guard and a standard break action design. These double-barrel derringers were chambered for .22 Long Rifle and .22 Magnum and were available in blued, nickel, silver, and gold-plated finishes. Although they were discontinued in 1984, American Derringer obtained the rights to the High Standard design in 1990 and produced a larger, .38 Special, version. These derringers, called the &quot;DS22&quot; and &quot;DA38&quot;, are still made and are popular concealed-carry handguns.

The COP 357 is a four-barrel, hammerless, double-action, .357 Magnum derringer with the barrels stacked in a 2 × 2 block. Introduced in 1984, it is not much larger than a .25 ACP semi-automatic pistol, and is significantly smaller than a small-frame revolver. A smaller-caliber version of the &quot;Mini COP&quot; in .22 Magnum was also made by American Derringer.

DoubleTap derringers are modern, hammerless, double-action, double-barreled, large caliber derringers designed for personal protection and introduced by DoubleTap Defense in 2012. They feature stainless steel ported barrels and aluminum or titanium alloy frames. They also hold two extra rounds in the grip. Its makers have stated that they drew inspiration from the FP-45 Liberator pistol, which also held extra ammunition in the grip.

<doc id="285540" wikidata="Q244652" url="?curid=285540" title="Phrae province">
<text>Phrae (; ; Northern Thai: แป้; ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six Provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) and lies in upper northern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (clockwise from north) Phayao, Nan, Uttaradit, Sukhothai, and Lampang.

==Geography==
Phrae is in the valley of the Yom River. The Phi Pan Nam Range runs across the province from north to south in the west. The Phlueng Range is in the east. The total forest area is or 64.8 percent of provincial area.

===National parks===
There are a total of four national parks, three of which with seven other national parks, make up region 13 (Phrae), and Lam Nam Nan in region 11 (Phitsanulok) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Lam Nam Nan National Park, 
* Mae Yom National Park, 
* Wiang Kosai National Park, 
* Doi Pha Klong National Park, 

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
There are two wildlife sanctuaries.
* Lam Nam Nan Fang Khwa Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Doi Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
The history of Phrae dates back to the Haripunchai kingdom of the Mon. It became part of Lan Na in 1443, when King Tilokaraj was on an expedition to capture Nan.

==Symbols==
Provincial seal: According to legend the two cities of Phrae and Nan were once ruled by brothers. When they met to divide the land between them the one from Phrae rode on a horse, the one from Nan on a buffalo to the meeting point on top of a mountain. Hence Phrae uses a horse in their seal, while Nan uses a buffalo. When the provincial government proposed the seal in 1940, the Fine Arts Department suggested adding a historic building to the seal in addition to the horse, thus it now has the stupa of Phra Tat Cho Hae on the back of the horse. This temple is about nine kilometers southeast of the city of Phrae.

The provincial flower and tree is the Burmese Almondwood (&quot;Chukrasia tabularis&quot;). The provincial fish is black sharkminnow (&quot;Labeo chrysophekadion&quot;).

==Transportation==
The main road through Phrae is Route 101, which begins in Nan to the north, passes through Phrae, and leads to Sawankhalok, Sukhothai, and finally Kamphaeng Phet.

Phrae Airport is a small airport in Mueang Mo, on the east side of town. It handles only domestic flights from Don Mueang (DMK).

The provincial railway station is Den Chai in Den Chai District, from Phrae town, since the town of Phrae does not have a rail to reach.

==Tourism==

Wiang Kosai National Park (อุทยานแห่งชาติเวียงโกศัย) contains two waterfalls, the Mae Koeng Luang (น้ำตกแม่เกิ๋งหลวง), and the Mae Koeng Noi (น้ำตกแม่เกิ๋งน้อย). Streams from the falls flow into the Yom River.

Tham Pha Nang Khoi Cave (ถ้ำผานางคอย). At the end of the cave is a stalagmite shaped like a woman holding a small child. In front of the Nang Koi (waiting woman) stone is a heart-shaped stalactite. They are the source of the legend of the love of a woman who waited for her lover until she turned to stone.

Mae Yom National Park and well-known Phae Mueang Phi Forest Park.

In addition, Phrae is also a province full of historic buildings. These buildings, all over 100 years old, were built in the Rattanakosin period or being used in the wood trading business that was once prosperous in the past.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 78 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 645 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phrae Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 26 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Phrae has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 25 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 57 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).
==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="285541" wikidata="Q1896682" url="?curid=285541" title="Chess club">
<text>A chess club is a club formed for the purpose of playing the board game of chess. Chess clubs often provide for both informal and tournament games and sometimes offer league play. Traditionally clubs play over the board and face to face chess as opposed to playing on internet chess servers or computer chess.

==Organization==
Clubs are mainly attached to a national federation, either directly or through membership of a regional chess association. The national federation in turn is a member of FIDE, the international governing body of chess. The global aegis helps to establish uniformity of rules and playing conditions internationally, though some countries such as the United States use their own official set of rules with minor differences from FIDE rules. The United States has many chess clubs affiliated with the United States Chess Federation (USCF). A club&#x27;s affiliation with its national chess federation helps to standardize chess tournament rules.

==Club facilities==
Chess clubs typically provide at least some of the following:
* Informal games, &#x27;friendlies&#x27;
* Club and inter-club competitions
* Opportunities to play in one or more leagues organized on a geographical basis
* Tournaments 
* A rating system where the results of inter-club games are rated to enable players to judge their standing and progress. Many clubs use the rating system provided by FIDE or their affiliated national chess organization. 
* Coaching by a more knowledgeable chess player and lectures/tuition evenings
* A library of chess books and journals, tournament records, internet access to chess databases
* Chess sets and boards, score sheets and chess clocks. Sometimes players may bring their own equipment.
* Adequate rooms or halls with tables and chairs, lighting and ventilation
* A regular meeting place that may be volunteered, rented or owned outright and maintained on club income, membership dues or donations. Small town clubs are usually housed in public, community buildings.
* Local media publicity, chess network contacts

<doc id="285542" wikidata="Q7250" url="?curid=285542" title="Wang Mang">
<text>Wang Mang (45 BCE6 October 23 CE), courtesy name Jujun, officially known as the Shijianguo Emperor (), was the founder and the only emperor of the short-lived Chinese Xin dynasty. He was originally an official and consort kin of the Han dynasty and later seized the throne in 9 CE. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marked the separation between the Western Han dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han dynasty (after Xin). Traditional Chinese historiography viewed Wang as a tyrant and usurper, while more recently, some historians have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. During his reign, he abolished slavery and initiated a land redistribution program. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the Chinese classics, his efforts ended in chaos.

Wang Mang&#x27;s late reign saw large-scale peasant rebellions, most notably the revolt of the Red Eyebrows. In October 23 CE, the capital Chang&#x27;an was attacked and the imperial palace ransacked. Wang Mang died in the battle. The Han dynasty was re-established in either 23 CE when the Gengshi Emperor took the throne, or in 25 when Emperor Guangwu of Han took the throne after defeating the Red Eyebrows who had deposed the Gengshi Emperor.

== Early life and career ==

Born in 45 BCE, Wang Mang was a son of Wang Man (王曼), a younger brother of Empress Wang Zhengjun, and his wife Qu (渠, family name unknown). His lineage can be traced back to the kings of Qi, whose descendants changed their surname to Wang () as Qi locals referred to them as the &quot;royal family&quot;. Wang Man died early when Wang Mang was still young, before Emperor Cheng took the throne and his mother Empress Wang became empress dowager. Unlike most of his brothers, Wang Mang did not have the opportunity to become a marquess. Empress Wang took pity on his family, and after she was widowed, she had Qu moved to the imperial palace to live with her.

While Wang Mang was well-connected to the imperial family, he did not have the luxurious lifestyle that his cousins enjoyed. Unlike his relatives who lived luxuriously and competed with each other on who could spend more, Wang Mang was praised for his humility, thriftiness, and his desire to study. He wore not the clothes of young nobles but those of a young Confucian scholar. He was also praised on how filial he was to his mother and how caring he was to the wife and son of his deceased brother Wang Yong (). Wang Mang befriended many capable people and served his uncles conscientiously.

When Wang Mang&#x27;s powerful uncle, commander of the armed forces Wang Feng (; 33–22 BCE) grew ill, Wang Mang cared for him day and night and attended to his medical and personal needs. Wang Feng was touched, and before his death, he asked Empress Dowager Wang and Emperor Cheng to take good care of Wang Mang. Wang Mang was therefore given the post of imperial attendant (黃門郎) and later promoted to be one of the subcommanders of the imperial guards (射聲校尉).

In 16 BCE, another of Wang Mang&#x27;s uncles, Wang Shang (王商) the Marquess of Chengdu, submitted a petition to divide part of his march and to make Wang Mang a marquess. Several well-regarded officials concurred in this request, and Emperor Cheng was impressed with Wang Mang&#x27;s reputation. He therefore made Wang Mang the Marquess of Xindu and promoted him to the Chamberlain for Attendants (光祿大夫). It was described by historians that the greater the position that Wang was promoted to, the more humble he became. He did not accumulate wealth but used the money to support scholars and to give gifts to colleagues which gained him much praise.

Wang Mang had only a single wife, Lady Wang, and no concubines. However, as later events would show, Wang was not completely faithful to his wife, even at this time.

Emperor Cheng appointed his uncles, one after another, to be the commander of the armed forces (the most powerful court official), and speculation grew as to who would succeed Wang Mang&#x27;s youngest surviving uncle, Wang Gen (王根, commander 12–8 BCE). Wang Mang was considered one of the possibilities, while another was his cousin Chunyu Zhang (a son of Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s sister), who had a much closer personal relationship to Emperor Cheng than Wang Mang. Chunyu also had friendly relations with both Emperor Cheng&#x27;s wife Empress Zhao Feiyan and his deposed former wife Empress Xu.

To overcome Chunyu&#x27;s presumptive hold on succeeding Wang Gen, Wang Mang took action. He collected evidence that Chunyu, a frivolous man in his words and deeds, had secretly received bribes from the deposed Empress Xu and had promised to help her become &quot;left empress&quot;, and that he had promised his associates important position once he succeeded Wang Gen. In 8 BCE, he informed Wang Gen and Empress Dowager Wang of the evidence, and both Wang Gen and Empress Dowager Wang were greatly displeased with Chunyu. They exiled Chunyu back to his march. Chunyu, before he left the capital, gave his horses and luxurious carriages to his cousin Wang Rong (王融), the son of his uncle Wang Li (王立), with whom he had a running feud. Wang Li, happy with Chunyu&#x27;s gift, submitted a petition requesting that Chunyu be allowed to remain at the capital. However, this request was treated with suspicion by Emperor Cheng because he knew of the feud between Wang Li and Chunyu. He ordered Wang Rong to be arrested, and Wang Li knowing this ordered his son to commit suicide in the middle of his panic. This dramatic action only made Emperor Cheng more suspicious. He therefore had Chunyu arrested and interrogated. Chunyu admitted to deceiving Empress Xu and receiving bribes from her, and he was executed.

On 16 November 8 BCE, Wang Gen, by was then seriously ill, submitted his resignation and requested that Wang Mang succeed him. On 28 November 8 BCE, Emperor Cheng made Wang Mang the commander of the armed forces (大司馬), at the age of 37.

==First tenure as the commander of the armed forces==
After Wang Mang was promoted to this position, effectively the highest in the imperial government. He became even better known for his self-discipline and promotion of capable individuals than before. As a result, the general perception of the Wang clan as arrogant, wasteful, and petty, began to be reversed.

In 7 BCE, Wang&#x27;s cousin Emperor Cheng died suddenly, apparently from a stroke (although some historians have suggested the possibility of an overdosage of aphrodisiacs given to him by Consort Zhao Hede). Emperor Cheng&#x27;s nephew Crown Prince Liu Xin was the son of Emperor Cheng&#x27;s brother, Prince Kang of Dingtao (Liu Kang ). Liu Xin became emperor (as Emperor Ai). For the time being, Wang remained in his post and continued to be powerful in the imperial court, as his aunt became grand empress dowager and was influential. However, that position soon changed.

Emperor Ai&#x27;s grandmother, Princess Dowager Fu of Dingtao (concubine of Grand Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s husband Emperor Yuan) was a domineering woman with a strong personality who was able to control her grandson and guide him as she pleased. She greatly wanted the title of empress dowager as well. Initially, Grand Empress Dowager Wang decreed that Princess Dowager Fu and Emperor Ai&#x27;s mother, Consort Ding, see him every 10 days. However, Princess Dowager Fu soon began to visit her grandson every day, insisting on bestowal of titles: Empress Dowager for herself, and titles of nobility for her relatives comparable to those of the Wangs. Grand Empress Dowager Wang, sympathetic to the difficult situation facing Emperor Ai, first granted Prince Kang the unusual title of &quot;Emperor Gong of Dingtao&quot; () and then, under the rationale of that title, granted Princess Dowager Fu the title &quot;Empress Dowager Gong of Dingtao&quot; () and Consort Ding the title &quot;Empress Gong of Dingtao&quot; (). Several members of the Fu and Ding clans were created marquesses. Grand Empress Dowager Wang also ordered Wang Mang to resign and transfer power to the Fu and Ding relatives. Emperor Ai declined to agree to this request and begged Wang Mang to stay in his administration.

Several months later, however, Wang Mang came into direct confrontation with now Empress Dowager Fu. At a major imperial banquet, the official in charge of seating placed Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s seat next to Grand Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s. When Wang Mang saw this, he rebuked the official and ordered that Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s seat be moved to the side, which drew great ire from Empress Dowager Fu, who then refused to attend the banquet. To soothe her anger, Wang Mang resigned, and Emperor Ai approved his resignation. After this event, the Wangs gradually and inexorably lost their power.

==Retirement during Emperor Ai&#x27;s reign==
After Wang Mang&#x27;s resignation, Emperor Ai initially requested him to remain in the capital Chang&#x27;an and periodically meet with him to give advice. However, in 5 BCE, Empress Dowager Fu achieved success in her quest for titles. Emperor Ai removed the qualification &quot;of Dingtao&quot; from his father&#x27;s posthumous title (thus making him simply &quot;Emperor Gong&quot;), and then gave his grandmother a variation of the grand empress dowager title (ditaitaihou (帝太太后), compared to Grand Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s title taihuangtaihou (太皇太后)) and his mother a variation of the empress dowager title (ditaihou (帝太后), compared to Empress Dowager Zhao&#x27;s title huangtaihou (皇太后)). The prime minister Zhu Bo (朱博) and vice prime minister Zhao Xuan (趙玄), at Empress Dowager Fu&#x27;s behest, submitted a petition to have Wang demoted to commoner status for having previously opposed Grand Empress Fu. Emperor Ai did not do so but sent Wang back to his march in Xindu (in modern Nanyang, Henan).

While in Xindu, Wang was careful not to associate with many people (to prevent false accusations that he was planning a rebellion). In 5 BCE, when his son Wang Huo killed a household servant, Wang Mang ordered him to commit suicide. By 2 BCE, there had been several hundred petitions by commoners and officials requesting Wang Mang&#x27;s return to the capital. Emperor Ai, who also respected Wang Mang, summoned him and his cousin Wang Ren (王仁), the son of Wang Gen, back to the capital to assist Grand Empress Dowager Wang. However, Wang Mang was to have no official post and was to exert little influence on politics.

==Regency and building of a personality cult==
Emperor Ai died suddenly in 1 BCE, without an heir. Taking decisive action, Grand Empress Dowager Wang seized power back from Emperor Ai&#x27;s male favourite and likely lover Dong Xian (who was the commander of the armed forces by this point) and summoned Wang Mang back to the imperial government. She put him in charge of the armed forces and the government. They summoned Prince Jizi of Zhongshan (the last surviving male issue of Grand Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s husband Emperor Yuan) to the capital to succeed Emperor Ai, and he ascended the throne as Emperor Ping. Wang Mang became his regent.

In 1 BCE, Wang Mang, now back in power, took drastic action to attack actual or perceived political enemies:
* The relations of Emperor Ai, the Fus and the Dings, were demoted and exiled back to their ancestral lands.
* Empress Dowager Zhao Feiyan, the wife of Emperor Cheng (who was friendly with the late Grand Empress Dowager Fu), and Empress Fu, the wife of Emperor Ai (and related to Grand Empress Dowager Fu) were demoted to commoner status and ordered to guard their husbands&#x27; tombs. They committed suicide in response.
* Grand Empress Dowager Fu and Empress Dowager Ding were posthumously demoted to the titles of &quot;the mother of Prince Gong of Dingtao&quot; and &quot;Consort Ding&quot; respectively. (In 5 CE, Wang disinterred Consorts Fu and Ding&#x27;s caskets and stripped their bodies of jade burial shells and then returned the bodies to Dingtao to be buried there. Their tombs were then completely flattened and surrounded with thorns.)
* Dong Xian (who had committed suicide soon after his demotion) was disinterred and reburied within a prison, and his clan was exiled.
* He Wu (何武), the former prime examiner, and his friend Gongsun Lu (公孫祿), who had opposed Wang Mang&#x27;s regency, were relieved of their posts.
* Wujiang Long (毋將隆), the governor of the Nan Commandery (modern Hubei), who had rejected Wang Mang&#x27;s advances to serve as a political ally, was charged with having falsely accused the innocent Princess Dowager Feng Yuan of Zhongshan of witchcraft in 6 CE (even though he was not involved). Wujiang Long, along with the actual co-conspirators against Princess Dowager Feng, were exiled.

Wang Mang, having thus consolidated his power, began to further build up his personality cult, encouraging others to submit false prophecies in which he was mentioned as the second coming of Ji Dan, the Duke of Zhou and the regent for King Cheng of Zhou, or other great mythical personalities. He also began a regime of modifying the governmental structure to recall the governments of the Zhou dynasty and the even more ancient Shang dynasty. This included numerous changes to officials&#x27; titles and even to geographical locations. To prevent Emperor Ping&#x27;s maternal Wei clan uncles from becoming powerful, he ordered that they, along with Emperor Ping&#x27;s mother, Consort Wei, not be allowed to visit Emperor Ping in the capital.

In 1 CE, after bribing the distant Yueshang tribes (probably in modern southern Vietnam) to submit offerings of an albino pheasant (considered a rare sign of divine favour), Wang Mang was successful in having his followers persuade Grand Empress Dowager Wang to create him the Duke of Anhan (安漢公). This was despite the Han nobility system not including dukes and no duke had ever been created in Han history up to that point. This action gave Wang Mang a title parallel to that of the Duke of Zhou. Believing her nephew to be truly faithful, Grand Empress Dowager Wang transferred more of her authority to him.

In 2 CE, Wang Mang issued a list of regulations to the ally-vassal Xiongnu, which the Xiongnu &quot;chanyu&quot; Nangzhiyasi (囊知牙斯—later shortened to Zhi in response to Wang Mang&#x27;s request) obeyed, but Wang Mang&#x27;s tone of treating Xiongnu as a subordinate state rather than an ally offended Nangzhiyasi, which would foreshadow the eventual breakdown of relationships with the Xiongnu. In the same year, Wang Mang decided to marry his daughter to Emperor Ping to further strengthen his position. Initially, he started a selection process of eligible noble young ladies (after declaring, in accordance with ancient customs, that Emperor Ping would have one wife and 11 concubines). However, in an act of false modesty intended to create the opposite result, he then petitioned Grand Empress Dowager Wang that his daughter not be considered. Wang Mang then started a petition with the aim of having the Chinese people have his daughter selected as empress. The petitioners stormed the outside of the palace, and Grand Empress Dowager Wang, overwhelmed by the display of affection for Wang Mang, ordered that Wang Mang&#x27;s daughter be made empress. In 4 CE, Emperor Ping officially married her and made her empress.

Wang Mang&#x27;s son, Wang Yu (王宇), disagreed with his father&#x27;s dictatorial regime and program to build up his personality cult, afraid that in the future the Wangs would suffer a popular backlash once Emperor Ping was an adult. In response he formed friendships with Emperor Ping&#x27;s Wei uncles, and told Consort Wei to offer assurances to Wang Mang that she would not act as Emperor Ai&#x27;s mother and grandmother did, trying to become an empress dowager. Wang Mang still refused to let her visit the capital.

In 3 CE, Wang Yu formed a conspiracy with his teacher, Wu Zhang (吳章), his brother-in-law, Lü Kuan (呂寬), and the Weis, to try to break Wang Mang&#x27;s dictatorial hold. They decided that they would create what appeared to be supernatural incidents to make Wang Mang concerned, and then have Wu Zhang try to persuade Wang Mang to transfer power to the Weis. Wang Yu instructed Lü Kuan to toss a bottle of blood onto Wang Mang&#x27;s mansion door, but Lü was discovered by Wang Mang&#x27;s guards. Wang Mang then arrested Wang Yu, who committed suicide, and his wife (Lü Kuan&#x27;s sister) Lü Yan (呂焉) who was then executed. Wang Mang subsequently executed Wu Zhang and the entire Wei clan, except for Consort Wei. It is not known what happened to Lü Kuan, but it is unlikely he could have escaped death.

Wang Mang took this opportunity to wipe out other potential enemies. Wang Yu and Lü&#x27;s co-conspirators were tortured with anyone who they mentioned being arrested, and then either executed or forced to commit suicide. The victims of this purge included Emperor Yuan&#x27;s sister, Princess Jingwu (敬武長公主), Wang Mang&#x27;s uncle, Wang Li, and his cousin, Wang Ren. He falsely advised Grand Empress Dowager Wang that they had died of illnesses. Many other officials who were not willing to follow Wang Mang were victimized in this purge. After this, Wang Mang&#x27;s hold on power became absolute. In 5 CE, Wang Mang revived an ancient ceremony intended for those who had made great contributions to the state and had himself given the nine bestowments (九錫). (The &quot;nine bestowments&quot; would, after Wang Mang, become a customary step for usurpers to receive before they usurped the throne.)

Around 5 CE, Emperor Ping, appeared to grow out of the heart condition from which he had suffered as a child. It soon became clear that he resented Wang Mang for killing his uncles and not allowing his mother to visit him in Chang&#x27;an. Wang therefore resolved to murder the emperor. In the winter of 5 CE, Wang submitted pepper wine (considered in those days to be capable of chasing away evil spirits) to the 13-year-old emperor, but had the wine spiked with poison. As the emperor was suffering the effects of the poison, Wang wrote a secret petition to the gods, in which he offered to substitute his life for Emperor Ping&#x27;s, and then had the petition locked away. (Historians generally believed that Wang had two motives in doing this: firstly, in case Emperor Ping recovered from the poisoning, to use the petition to try to absolve himself of involvement in the poisoning and, secondly, to leave for posterity evidence of his faithfulness to the emperor. After a few days of suffering, Emperor Ping died.

==As acting emperor==
Because the young Emperor Ping didn&#x27;t have any children with his wife Empress Wang or any of his concubines, there were no heir. Also, there were now no surviving male issue from Emperor Ping&#x27;s grandfather, Emperor Yuan. Emperor Ping&#x27;s great-grandfather&#x27;s Emperor Xuan progeny were therefore examined for possible successors.

There were 53 great-grandsons of Emperor Xuan then still living but at the time and they were all adults. Wang Mang disliked the fact that they were all adults as he wanted a child whom he could control. Therefore, he declared that it was inappropriate for members of the same generation to succeed each other (even though Emperor Ping had succeeded his cousin Emperor Ai several years earlier). He then examined the 23 great-great-grandsons of Emperor Xuan—all of whom were infants or children.

While the examination process was proceeding, the mayor of South Chang&#x27;an submitted a rock with mysterious red writing on it. The message on the rock was &quot;Wang Mang, the Duke of Anhan, should be emperor.&quot; In May, Wang had his political allies force Grand Empress Dowager Wang to issue an edict granting him the title of &quot;Acting Emperor&quot; (假皇帝), with a commission to rule as emperor until one of Emperor Xuan&#x27;s great-great-grandson could be selected as the new Emperor. To further bolster his claims, Wang also created a false genealogy, declaring himself a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, a legendary emperor revered in Chinese culture.

In the spring of 6 CE, acting Emperor Wang selected the child Ying, then just one year old, as the designated successor to Emperor Ping, claiming that soothsayers told him that Ying was the candidate most favoured by the gods. He gave Ying the epithet &quot;Ruzi&quot;, the same epithet that King Cheng of Zhou had when he was in his minority and under the regency of the Duke of Zhou. This was intended to support Wang Mang&#x27;s claim that he was as faithful as the Duke of Zhou before him. However, Emperor Ruzi did not ascend the throne but was given the title of crown prince. Empress Wang was given the title empress dowager.

As acting emperor, Wang reinstituted the Zhou system of five grades of nobility—duke (公, &quot;gong&quot;), marquess (侯, &quot;hou&quot;), earl (伯, &quot;bo&quot;), viscount (子, &quot;zi&quot;), and baron (男, &quot;nan&quot;).

Several members of the imperial Liu clan were naturally suspicious of acting Emperor Wang&#x27;s intentions. They started or were involved in several failed rebellions against Wang:

* In 6 CE, Liu Chong (劉崇), the Marquess of Anzhong, launched an attack against Wan (宛, in modern Nanyang, Henan). His attack failed. It is not known what happened to him, other than that as a punishment, Wang had his house filled with dirty water.
* In 7 CE, Zhai Yi (翟義), the governor of Dong Commandery and Liu Xin (劉信), the Marquess of Yanxiang (and the father of Liu Kuang (劉匡), the Prince of Dongping (modern Tai&#x27;an, Shandong)) started the largest rebellions of all. They were joined by agrarian rebellion leaders Zhao Peng (趙朋) and Huo Hong (霍鴻) from the area immediately west of the capital Chang&#x27;an. They declared Liu Xin emperor. Wang responded by sending messengers all around the nation to pledge that he would in fact pass on the throne to Emperor Ruzi once he was an adult. Wang&#x27;s armies defeated Zhai and Liu&#x27;s armies in the winter, and Zhai was captured and executed. Liu fled and was never captured. Zhao and Huo were also eventually defeated and executed.
* In 9 CE (after Wang Mang had usurped the imperial throne), Liu Kuai (劉快), the Marquess of Xuxiang, attacked the Duchy of Fuchong, of his brother Liu Ying (劉殷), the former Prince of Jiaodong. He was defeated and died while fleeing from the battle.

After Zhai and Liu Xin were defeated, Wang was satisfied that the empire was entirely under his control. So, he decided to finally seize the throne and start a new dynasty. In the winter of 8 CE, after receiving a false prophecy written by a criminal named Ai Zhang (哀章) which pretended to be a divine decree from Emperor Gaozu (Liu Bang) stating that the throne should be given to Wang, and that Grand Empress Dowager Wang should follow this divine will, Wang issued a decree accepting the position of emperor, establishing the Xin dynasty.

==Early reign==

Early in his reign, Emperor Wang Mang confidently sought to implement his ideals of restoring the legendary golden age of the early Zhou dynasty as theorised in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;. To that end, he modified the governmental structure to better conform with standards attributed to the Zhou. He also continued the regime of modifying geographical names to fit with ancient names (or more euphemistic names). This meant that even imperial edicts discussing the locations by their new names were forced to include notes on the old names so that the recipients of the edicts could tell what locations he was referring to. As part of this regime, the name of the capital was changed. Chang&#x27;an was redesignated Chang&#x27;an . The characters are now homophones in Standard Mandarin but had distinct pronunciations at the time.

In 9 CE, Wang Mang promoted his wife Lady Wang to the position of empress. By this point, only two of her four sons were still alive. The older Wang An () was described as lacking in talent, so Wang Mang made the younger Wang Lin () crown prince, and made Wang An the Lord of Xinjia (). Wang Mang selected many Confucian scholars to serve as advisors for Crown Prince Lin.

Wang, grateful to his aunt Grand Empress Dowager Wang (who, however, resented him for deceiving her and usurping the throne), continued to honour her as empress dowager, but also gave her an additional title of &quot;Wangmu&quot; (王母), the same title carried by the mother of King Wen of Zhou, implying that she was also his mother and had helped establish a new dynasty. She died in 13 CE.

===Economic policies===
In 9 CE, Wang Mang instituted a revolutionary land redistribution system, ordering that all land in the empire legally become the empire&#x27;s property, known as &quot;wangtian&quot; (王田) (meaning Wang&#x27;s land or the king&#x27;s land), a system that bore similarity to the well-field system attributed to the Zhou dynasty. Any further real estate transactions were banned, although property owners were allowed to continue possessing their properties. If a household had less than eight members but had one &quot;well&quot; or larger property (about ), then they were required to distribute the excess land to fellow clan members, neighbours, or other members of the same village. Criticism of the &quot;wangtian&quot; system was punishable by exile. The existing aristocracy were not too fond of having their land stripped from them, so they start bribing local officials to keep their lands, and local officials who were landlords themselves also started resisting the &quot;wangtian&quot; system. Some local officials took this opportunity to take free land from the people and redistribute it amongst their clan members. Farmers who were at first thrilled at the idea of getting free land but found that not only were they not getting free land – because Wang Mang didn&#x27;t do anything to ensure that local officials were doing their jobs right – in addition to corrupt local officials who were taking the opportunity to take what little land they had left in the name of the law, both found themselves opposing the new system. Eventually, faced with resistance for both of these policies, Wang was forced to repeal both of them just three years later in 12 CE.

In 10 CE, Wang set up a state economic adjustment agency, seeking to control fluctuations in the prices of food and textiles by purchasing excess goods and then selling them when the price went up. The same agency also became responsible for loaning money to entrepreneurs, at the rate of three percent per month. Six offices were set up: in Chang&#x27;an, Luoyang, Handan, Linzi (modern Zibo, Shandong), Wancheng (modern Nanyang, Henan), and Chengdu.

In the same year, Wang Mang instituted a &quot;sloth tax&quot;: if landowners left their land uncultivated, city dwellers left their houses without trees, or citizens refused to work, they would pay penalties in the form of textile tributes. Those unable to pay the penalties would be required to perform work for the state. The new emperor had not accounted for people unable to find work, nor those living in mountainous areas with little work, already struggling to survive. Many old people who wanted to live a quiet life in the mountains were forced to move back in with their children to avoid taxation.

In 9 CE, Emperor Wang Mang of the Xin dynasty (9 to 23 CE) established the first income tax through a 10% tax of net earnings from wild herb and fruit collection, fishing, shepherding, and various nonagricultural activities and forms of trading. People were obligated to report their taxes to the government and officials would audit these reports. The penalty for evading this tax was one year of hard labor and confiscation of the entirety of a person&#x27;s property. Previously, all Chinese taxes were either head taxes or property taxes, in addition to corvée labour. Because it caused popular discontent, this income tax was abolished in 22 CE. Wang also instituted a state monopoly on liquor and weapons.

Another economic change instituted by Wang – which turned out to be disastrous – was to issue 28 types of coins: made of gold, silver, tortoise shells, cowrie shells, or copper. Because there were so many kinds of coins in comparison to the one kind that the Han used, people were unable to work out which coins were genuine or counterfeit, and the money-based economy came to a halt. Eventually, Wang was forced to abolish all but two kinds of coins: the small coin that had the same value of a Han coin, and the large coin that had the value of 50 small coins. However, despite fairly severe penalties, people lost faith in the Xin dynasty&#x27;s currency and continued to use Han coins in an underground trade economy.

In 13 CE, during Emperor Wang Mang&#x27;s rule, the Heavenly Stems were incorporated to number the years, replacing the previous system which used only the Earthly Branches.

In 17 CE, in an attempt to refill the depleted imperial coffers, Wang instituted six monopolies: on liquor, salt, iron, coinage, forestry, and fishing. However, because of rampant corruption, the imperial treasury received only limited benefit, while the people were greatly burdened. In the same year, Wang abolished slavery to limit the power of the landowning families. Anyone who offended the law will be punished by (paradoxically) being turned a slave. Wang also did not account for the fact that because of the aforementioned &quot;sloth tax&quot; many people would sell themselves into slavery to earn money so they could help their families pay the tax. Following Wang&#x27;s assassination in 23 CE, slavery was reinstituted.

===Deterioration of the relationship with Xiongnu and other vassals===

====Problems with Xiongnu====

The first sign of irritation came sometime before 10 CE when the Xin director of Wuhuan affairs informed the Wuhuan tribes not to pay further tribute to Xiongnu. In response, Xiongnu carried out a punitive military raid against Wuhuan, capturing about 1,000 women and children to serve as hostages. Later, on Wang Mang&#x27;s orders, the Xiongnu were forced to return the Wuhuan hostages.

Wang sent his ambassadors to the Xiongnu to inform Shanyu Zhi that Wang Mang had become emperor and that Xin had replaced Han. The ambassadors requested that the great seal of the shanyu, which Han had issued, be exchanged for a new seal issued by Xin. The old seal read, &quot;the Great Seal of the Shanyu of Xiongnu&quot; (); the new seal read &quot;the Seal of the Shanyu of Gongnu of Xin&quot; (), changing the meanings &quot;ferocious slave&quot; (; Xiongnu) to &quot;respectful slave&quot; ; &quot;Shanyu&quot; (the chief of the tribes) to &quot;Shanyu&quot; ; and &quot;seal&quot; to &quot;badge&quot; , implying that the Xiongnu were nothing but a vassal of the Xin. This contrasted with the Han who had been somewhat ambiguous about whether the Xiongnu were a vassal group. Without examining the new seal, Shanyu Zhi agreed to the exchange. The ambassadors, apprehensive that the Shanyu – once he realized what had happened – would demand the old seal back, destroyed the old seal. Indeed, the next day, Shanyu Zhi realized that the seal&#x27;s text had changed and requested that the old seal be returned. However, upon being informed that the old seal had been destroyed (which the ambassadors claimed falsely to be an act of the gods), he acquiesced. The Xiongnu leader nevertheless began to prepare for confrontation with Wang Mang&#x27;s Xin. The Shanyu built defensive bulwarks some distance from the Xin outpost of Shuofang (, modern Ordos, Inner Mongolia). He also began to accept Xiyu (&quot;Western Regions&quot;, in modern Xinjiang and central Asia) kingdoms&#x27; pledges of allegiance, an action that had been banned by Wang.

Wang, irritated, declared war against Xiongnu. The strategy that he set out was to divide the Xin forces into 12 armies to divide and conquer Xiongnu. Under this scenario, Chanyu Zhi would be attacked and forced to retreat to the Dingling tribes (around Lake Baikal), and Xiongnu would be divided into 15 small kingdoms to be ruled by 15 descendants of Chanyu Huhanye, who had first established friendly relations with Han. Under this plan, 300,000 men would be gathered for the attack. However, Wang did not follow his generals&#x27; recommendations to start the campaign as soon as a critical mass of men were gathered but wanted to attack with overwhelming force. This placed pressure on the border regions as they strained to accommodate, over what turned about to be a lengthy period, the men who had arrived, while fruitlessly waiting for the full support of 300,000 to be gathered.

In the first stage of this plan, one of the local commanders kidnapped one of Chanyu Zhi&#x27;s brothers, Xian (咸), the Prince of Zuoliwu (左犁汙王), and his sons Deng (登) and Zhu (助), by trickery. Xian and Zhu were made Chanyus, the first two of the planned 15. Chanyu Zhi became enraged and launched massive attacks against Xin border regions, causing the border regions much distress and economic and human loss. Eventually, Xian escaped back to Xiongnu, but his sons were kept as hostages. After Zhu died, Deng succeeded him. However, in 12 CE, after hearing reports that Xian&#x27;s other son Jiao (角) had been a successful Xiongnu strategist in military actions against the Xin, Wang, in anger, executed Deng and his attendants.

In 13 CE, Chanyu Zhi died. The powerful official Xubu Dang (須卜當) and his wife Yun, the Princess Yimuo (the daughter of Chanyu Huhanye and Wang Zhaojun), who advocated peaceful relations with Xin and who were also friendly with Xian, supported Xian as the new Chanyu. Even though Xian was unaware that Wang Mang had executed his son Deng, relations between Xiongnu and Xin remained tense. There was a temporary détente in 14 CE, when Xian returned Xin defectors Chen Liang (陳良) and Zhong Dai (終帶), who, as junior army officers in Xiyu, had killed their superiors and surrendered to Xiongnu (perhaps seeking to have Xiongnu help them re-establish Han) so that Wang could execute them. In response, Wang recalled the forces located in the northern regions which were intended to be used to attack Xiongnu (but were never given the full support that Wang envisioned). However, after Chanyu Xian found out late in 14 CE that Deng had been executed, he resumed raids against the border regions but maintained a façade of peace.

====Problems with southwestern tribes====
When Wang Mang first became emperor, his ambassadors visited the southwestern tribes (in modern Guizhou, Yunnan, and southwestern Sichuan), whose chieftains Han had largely granted the titles of princes. Wang&#x27;s new seals demoted them to the titles of marquesses. One of the more powerful chieftains, Han (邯), the Prince of Juting (句町王), responded by angrily cutting off relations with Xin. Wang instructed the local commandery governor, Zhou Xin (周歆), to arrange for the killing of Han. In response, Han&#x27;s brother Cheng (承) started a rebellion, killing Zhou, and starting a campaign of harassment against Xin borders. By 16 CE, the Commandery of Yizhou (modern northeastern Yunnan) had become corrupt while Juting remained powerful. So Wang commissioned two generals, Lian Dan (廉丹) and Shi Xiong (史熊), to attack Juting. They were initially successful, but soon became caught in problems with food supply and disease. However, Wang continued to refuse to reinstitute the Han system of using awards to buy the submission of southwestern tribes.

====Problems with Goguryeo====
When Wang started his campaign against Xiongnu, he requisitioned the forces of Goguryeo within Xin borders. Goguryeo refused to cooperate and marched out of the Xin borders. The Xin army that Wang sent against them was defeated by them. The general Wang sent, Yan You (嚴尤), used humble words to trick their leader, Zou (騶), who was a marquess of Goguryeo, into a meeting with him where he treacherously killed Zou. Wang then changed Gaogouli to the derogatory term &quot;Xiagouli&quot; (&quot;gao&quot; means &quot;high&quot;, while &quot;xia&quot; means &quot;low&quot;), and reduced their king&#x27;s rank to marquess, which further enraged Goguryeo, causing them to attack the Xin northeastern regions with great ferocity.

====Problems with Xiyu kingdoms====
The troubles for Xin with the Xiyu kingdoms started in 10 CE. In that year, Xuzhili (須置離), the King of Rear Cheshi (後車師, now part of Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture) became concerned about the great cost of hosting Xin ambassadors and considered abandoning his kingdom and fleeing to Xiongnu. Xin&#x27;s Xiyu commissioner Dan Qin (但欽) summoned Xuzhili and executed him. Xuzhili&#x27;s brother Hulanzhi (狐蘭之) fled to Xiongnu and then attacked Dan, inflicting severe casualties, before withdrawing.

In 13 CE, the dual kingdom of Wusun (which, under a system set up by Han, had two kings: the greater king was a descendant of a Han princess and her husband the king of Wusun, while the lesser king was a descendant of her brother-in-law) sent ambassadors to Chang&#x27;an to offer tributes. Because Wang Mang knew that the people of Wusun actually had greater affinity for the lesser king, he placed the ambassador of the lesser king in a higher position than the ambassador of the greater king, which greatly insulted the greater king.

In response, the Xiyu kingdoms joined forces and attacked the Xiyu commissioner Dan, and managed to kill him. The Xiyu kingdoms then decided to no longer pledge allegiance to Xin. In 16 CE, Wang made another attempt to intimidate the Xiyu kingdoms back into submission, but the Xin armies were divided and cut off from each other. One army was entirely wiped out. The other was forced to withdraw to Qiuzi (龜茲, in modern Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang) with its way back to Xin proper cut off, and the army settled there and was unable to return for the rest of the Xin dynasty&#x27;s duration.

===Paralysis and corruption of the government===
In addition to these wars, a major problem plaguing Wang Mang&#x27;s administration was that Wang Mang was so committed to implementing the ancient governmental structure, believing that once things were restored to Zhou dynasty standards, the government would be efficient. He and his officials spent inordinate amounts of time carrying out research of legends, but leaving important affairs of the state undecided. A large number of counties lacked magistrates for years. The local officials, without supervision, became highly corrupt and oppressive towards the populace.

Because of the way Wang came to power, he also became suspicious of allowing his subordinates to have too much power. Therefore, he made all important decisions himself and did not delegate. This meant that many important decisions were delayed or never made. Further, he entrusted eunuchs to screen the reports from local governments for him, but those eunuchs would decide to relay or not relay those reports based on their own personal likes and dislikes, and many important petitions went unanswered.

An even more serious problem was that the officials lacked salaries. Han had a well-defined system of official salaries, but when Wang became emperor, he ordered that the salary system be overhauled and recalibrated. However, because a new system took years to be established, officials went without salaries in the meantime. In response, they became corrupt and demanded bribes from the people, causing much distress. In 16 CE, Wang finally issued the new salary system, which was dependent on how prosperous the state was in determining what the salaries were. However, because the prosperity of the state was a highly subjective matter, officials continued to go without salaries for the rest of the Xin dynasty&#x27;s existence.

==Middle reign ==

=== Agrarian rebellions ===
For a while, despite the failures of Wang&#x27;s policies, the people were generally obedient, and his reign as Emperor looked to be on a firm footing. However, in 11 CE, the Yellow River overflowed its banks, flooding much of the surrounding land in the process. The ensuing famine led to prophecies that Wang had lost the Mandate of Heaven and that the Han dynasty would be restored.

About 17 CE, as the burdens from the wars and the corruption continued to increase and famines occurred (there was a major famine in Jing Prefecture (modern Hubei, Hunan, and southern Henan)), several agrarian rebellions started and took hold. The more significant rebellion and rebellion leaders included:

* Guatian Yi (瓜田儀), who occupied territory in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu.
*Mother Lü, whose son was a minor civil servant who was wrongly killed by the county magistrate. She gathered a group of desperate young men and killed the county magistrate, and then went out to the sea to become pirates, but later returned to land when her forces increased in size.
* Zhang Ba (張霸), who occupied territory in modern Jingzhou, Hubei.
* Yang Mu (羊牧), who occupied territory in modern Xiaogan, Hubei.
* Diao Zidu (刁子都), who roved through what is modern western Shandong and northern Jiangsu.
* The Lülin Mountain (綠林山, in modern Yichang, Hubei) rebels, who were led by Wang Kuang (王匡) and Wang Feng (王鳳, not to be confused with Wang Mang&#x27;s uncle of the same name). Because both Wang Kuang and Wang Feng were from Xinshi (新市, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), these rebels were also known as Xinshi rebels.
* The Chimei (赤眉, &quot;red eyebrows&quot;) rebels, who were led by Fan Chong (樊崇), who roved through large swaths of territory in modern southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu.

Wang Mang sent messengers issuing pardons with the aim of encouraging these rebels to disband. Once the messengers returned to Chang&#x27;an, some honestly reported that the rebels had gathered because the harsh laws made it impossible for them to make a living and therefore they were forced to rebel. Some, in order to flatter Wang Mang, told him that these were simply evil troublemakers who needed to be killed, or that this was a temporary phenomenon. Wang listened to those who flattered him and generally relieved from their posts those who told the truth. Further, Wang made no further attempts to pacify the rebels, but instead decided to suppress them by force.

=== Problems with Xiongnu relations ===
Around this time, Wang made another strategic mistake involving Xiongnu. In 18 CE, Chanyu Xian died, and his brother Yu (輿) became chanyu. He wanted to consider peace with Xin, and he sent one of his key officials and a nephew of his to serve as ambassadors to Chang&#x27;an. In response, Wang Mang sent Wang Zhaojun&#x27;s brother, Wang She (王歙), to meet with Princess Yun and her husband, Xuyu Dang. At the meeting, however, Xin forces surprised and kidnapped the princess and her husband and took them to Chang&#x27;an. Wang Mang created Xuyu chanyu and envisioned placing him on the Xiongnu throne by force. This ended any hope of peace with Xiongnu.

=== Change of heir ===
In 20 CE, Wang Mang made a sudden change to his presumed heir. He deposed Crown Prince Lin based on the rationale that trouble would come from the fact that Crown Prince Lin was younger than his brother Lord An, and thus Lin should not have been crown prince in the first place. He then created Lord An the Prince of Xinqian and Wang Lin the Prince of Tongyiyang.

In 21 CE, Empress Wang died. After her death, Wang Mang discovered that one of Empress Wang&#x27;s ladies in waiting, Yuan Bi (原碧), with whom he had an affair, had also had an affair with Crown Prince Lin, and that she had conspired with Crown Prince Lin to kill Wang Mang, because of Wang Lin&#x27;s demotion. Wang Mang ordered Wang Lin to commit suicide by poison, but Wang Lin refused, and killed himself using a sword. Later that year, Wang An died as well. Wang Mang then announced that he had in fact two sons by female servants, whom he then created dukes.

==Late reign==

===Agrarian revolts===
In 22 CE, Wang Mang finally realised (as many of his officials had been trying to tell him) that the agrarian rebellions were posing a much greater threat to his rule than the Xiongnu. He commissioned two of his key officials, Wang Kuang (王匡, not to be confused with the Lülin leader of the same name) and Lian Dan to launch attacks against the agrarian rebellions, with the Chimei being their first target. Wang and Lian had some initial successes, but Wang insisted on having them keep fighting without resting, and the fatigued forces eventually collapsed.

In the same year, the Lülin forces suffered the effects of a major plague which killed about half of the rebels. This caused them to divide. One branch headed west to the region of modern Jingzhou, Hubei, while the other headed north to the region of the modern Nanyang, Henan.

=== Liu&#x27;s revolt merges with Lülin agrarian revolt ===
Around this time, the most ambitious of the rebels emerged. Liu Yan, a descendant of a distant branch of the Han imperial clan, who lived in his ancestral territory of Chongling (舂陵, in modern Xiangyang, Hubei), had long been disgusted by Wang Mang&#x27;s usurpation of the Han throne, and had long aspired to start a rebellion. His brother Liu Xiu, by contrast, was a careful and deliberate man, who was content to be a farmer. Around this time, there were prophecies being spread in the community that the Lius would return to power, and many men gathered about Liu Yan, requesting that he lead them. He agreed and joined forces with the branch of the Lülin forces which were in the same area. Together they began to capture territory rather than just simply roving and raiding. In 23 CE, under Liu Yan&#x27;s leadership, the joint forces had a major victory over Zhen Fu (甄阜), the governor of Nanyang Commandery, killing him. They then besieged the important city of Wan (the capital of Nanyang).

===A new imperial pretender===
By this point, many other rebel leaders had become jealous of Liu Yan&#x27;s capabilities, and while a good number of their men admired Liu Yan and wanted him to become the emperor of a newly declared Han dynasty, some of the rebel leaders had other ideas. They found another local rebel leader, also of Han imperial descent, Liu Xuan, who was considered a weak personality, and requested that he be made emperor. Liu Yan initially opposed this move and instead suggested that Liu Xuan carry the title &quot;Prince of Han&quot; first (echoing the founder of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gao). The other rebel leaders refused, and in early 23 CE, Liu Xuan was proclaimed Gengshi Emperor. Liu Yan became prime minister.

===The Battle of Kunyang===
In the spring of 23 CE, a major military confrontation sealed Wang Mang&#x27;s fate. He sent his cousin Wang Yi (王邑) and his prime minister, Wang Xun (王尋), with what he considered to be overwhelming force, some 430,000 men, intending to crush the newly reconstituted Han regime. The Han forces were at this point in two groups. One group was led by Wang Feng, Wang Chang (王常), and Liu Xiu, which, in response to the arrival of the Xin forces, withdrew to the small town of Kunyang (昆陽, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan). The other group was led by Liu Yan, which was besieging Wancheng. The rebels in Kunyang initially wanted to scatter, but Liu Xiu opposed that strategy. Rather, he advocated that they guard Kunyang securely, while he would bring together all other available troops from the surrounding areas and attack the Xin forces. After initially rejecting Liu Xiu&#x27;s idea, the Kunyang rebels eventually agreed.

Liu Xiu carried out his action, and when he returned to Kunyang, he began harassing the besieging Xin forces from the outside. Wang Yi and Wang Xun led 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu and ordered the rest of their troops not to move from their siege locations. Once they engaged in battle, however, after minor losses, the other units were hesitant to assist them, and Liu Xiu killed Wang Xun in battle. After that, the Han forces inside Kunyang burst out of the city and attacked the other Xin units leading to the much larger Xin forces suffering a total collapse. Many of the Xin soldiers deserted and headed to their homes. Wang Yi had to withdraw with only several thousand men back to Luoyang. This was a major blow to Xin and marked the beginning of the end for the Xin dynasty.

=== Conquest of the capitals ===
Gengshi Emperor then established two armies, one led by Wang Kuang, which targeted Luoyang, and the other led by Shentu Jian (申屠建) and Li Song (李松), which targeted Chang&#x27;an. Many of the populace on the way gathered, welcomed and then joined the Han forces. Shentu and Li quickly reached the outskirts of Chang&#x27;an. The rebels sacked the capital on 4 October 23. In response, the young men within Chang&#x27;an also rose up and stormed Weiyang Palace, the main imperial palace. Wang died in the battle at the palace (by Du Wu (杜吳)), as did his daughter Princess Huanghuang (the former empress of Han). After Wang died, the crowd fought over the right to have the credit for having killed Wang, and tens of soldiers died in the ensuing fight. Wang&#x27;s body was cut into pieces, and his head was delivered to the provisional Han capital Wancheng, to be hung on the city wall. However, the angry people took it off the wall and kicked it around, and someone cut his tongue off and ate it. Eventually, the head was preserved and kept in a court vault, until it was destroyed in a fire during the Jin dynasty.

<text>The Vienna Central Cemetery () is one of the largest cemeteries in the world by number of interred, and is the most well-known cemetery among Vienna&#x27;s nearly 50 cemeteries. The cemetery&#x27;s name is descriptive of its significance as Vienna&#x27;s biggest cemetery, not of its geographic location, as it is not in the city center of the Austrian capital, but on the southern outskirts, in the outer city district of Simmering.

==History and description==
Unlike many others, the Vienna Central Cemetery is not one that has evolved slowly. The decision to establish a new, big cemetery for Vienna came in 1863 when it became clear that – due to industrialization – the city&#x27;s population would eventually increase to such an extent that the existing communal cemeteries would prove to be insufficient. City leaders expected that Vienna, then capital of the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, would grow to four million inhabitants by the end of the 20th century, as no-one foresaw the Empire&#x27;s collapse in 1918. The city council therefore assigned an area significantly outside of the city&#x27;s borders and of such large dimension, that it would suffice for a long time to come. They decided in 1869 that a flat area in Simmering should be the site of the future Central Cemetery. The cemetery was designed in 1870; according to the plans of the Frankfurt landscape architects Karl Jonas Mylius and Alfred Friedrich Bluntschli who were awarded for their project &quot;per angusta ad augusta&quot; (from dire to sublime).

The cemetery was opened on All Saints&#x27; Day in 1874. However the consecration of the cemetery was not without controversy: the interdenominational character of the new cemetery – the different faith groups being interred on the same ground – met with fierce resistance, especially in conservative circles of the Roman Catholic Church.

This argument became even more aggressive when the city announced that it did not want an official Catholic opening of the new cemetery – but gave a substantial amount of money toward the construction of a segregated Jewish section. In the end, the groups reached an agreement resulting in the Catholic representatives opening the Central Cemetery with a small ceremony. Due to refraining from having a large public showing, the new cemetery was inaugurated almost unnoticed in the early morning of 31 October 1874 by Vienna Mayor Baron Cajetan von Felder and Cardinal Joseph Othmar Rauscher to avoid an escalation of the public controversy. The official opening of the Central Cemetery occurred the following day. The first burial was that of Jacob Zelzer, followed by 15 others that day. The grave of Jacob Zelzer still exists near the administration building at the cemetery wall.

The cemetery spans with 330,000 gravesites containing around 3 million deceased, and up to 25 burials daily. It is also the second largest cemetery, after the of Hamburg&#x27;s Ohlsdorf Cemetery, which is the largest in Europe by land area. 

A Viennese joke has it that the Central Cemetery is &quot;half the size of Zürich, but twice as much fun&quot;, ().

Opposite the cemetery&#x27;s main gate, across Simmeringer Hauptstrasse, is the &quot;Feuerhalle Simmering&quot;, Vienna&#x27;s first crematorium, which was built by Clemens Holzmeister in 1922 in the style of an oriental fortress.

St. Charles Borromeo Cemetery Church is the central church of the cemetery. It used to be called &quot;Dr. Karl-Lueger-Gedächtniskirche&quot; (Karl Lueger Memorial Church) because of the crypt of the former mayor of Vienna below the high altar. This church in Art Nouveau style was built in 1908–1910 by Max Hegele. The crypt of Austrian presidents is situated in front of the church. The burial vault is located beneath the sarcophagus, with stairs leading down to a circular room whose walls are lined with niches where urns or coffins can be interred.

On 1 November 2023, unidentified vandals set a fire and sprayed swastikas on external walls overnight in the cemetery&#x27;s Jewish section. The entrance lobby to a ceremonial hall was burned for the first time since the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom by the Nazis, but there were no injuries. The attack was condemned by Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

==&quot;Ehrengräber&quot;==
In its early incarnations, the cemetery was unpopular because of its distance from the city centre. This forced authorities to think of ways to make it more attractive: Hence honorary graves () as a way of attracting tourists were established.

Interred in the Central Cemetery are notables such as Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert, who were moved to the Central Cemetery from &quot;Währinger Ostfriedhof&quot; in 1888; Johannes Brahms; Antonio Salieri; Johann Strauss II and Arnold Schoenberg. A cenotaph honours Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who is buried in nearby St. Marx Cemetery.

==Interdenominational character==

In addition to the Catholic section, the cemetery houses a Protestant cemetery (opened 1904) and two Jewish cemeteries.

Although the older of the two, established in 1863, was destroyed by the Nazis during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, around 60,000 graves remain intact. Cemetery records indicate 79,833 Jewish burials as of 10 July 2011. Prominent burials here include those of the Rothschild family and that of the author Arthur Schnitzler. The second Jewish cemetery was built in 1917 and is still in use today. There were 58,804 Jewish burials in the new section as of 21 November 2007. Officials discovered the desecration of 43 Jewish graves in the two Jewish sections on 29 June 2012, allegedly as an anti-Semitic act – the stones and slabs were toppled or damaged.

Since 1876, Muslims have been buried at Vienna&#x27;s Zentralfriedhof. The dead are buried according to Austrian law, in a coffin, in contrast to the Islamic ritual practice: burial in a shroud. The opening of the new Islamic cemetery of the Islamic Faith Community took place on 3 October 2008 in Liesing.

The cemetery also contains Russian Orthodox burial grounds (Saint Lazarus chapel, 1894) and plots dedicated for the use of various Eastern Orthodox churches. Since 1869, members of the Greek Orthodox community have been buried in Section 30 A, just west of Gate 2, near the arcades. The Romanian Orthodox community is near Gate 3 in Section 38 as are members of the Bulgarian Orthodox churches. The Serbian Orthodox community received portions of Sections 68 B and 69 C, near Gate 3. Section 27 A contains the tombs of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

The Protestant section on the east side is dedicated for the use of both confessions-parts of the Evangelical Protestant church in Austria, the Lutheran A.B (Evangelische Kirche Augsburger Bekenntnis) and Calvinist H.B (Evangelische Kirche Helvetisches Bekenntnis). The cemetery was inaugurated in the presence of the President of the Evangelical Protestant Church, Dr. Rudolf Franz on 14 November 1904. The cemetery was expanded in 1926, 1972 and 1998. The Protestant section consists of 6,000 graves and 300 family vaults. There is a 300-seat church named &quot;Heilandskirche&quot; on the cemetery ground which serves the purpose of a cemetery chapel. The church was consecrated by Pastor Rudolf Morally. The reredos and the altar on the apse of the church is ornamented with a crucifix by sculptor Josef Grünhut. 

In 2000, a &quot;Baby burial ground&quot; opened in Section 35 B near Gate 3 where stillborn infants, dead babies, and young children up to of height are interred.

Europe&#x27;s first Buddhist cemetery was established in the Vienna Central Cemetery in May 2005. An area of the Central Cemetery has been set aside for this purpose centered around a stupa, and was consecrated by a Tibetan monk.

The new &quot;Anatomy Memorial&quot; opened in Section 26, on 5 March 2009, for interments of the Institute of Anatomy of the Medical University of Vienna and for the people who donated their bodies to science.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Austria celebrated the dedication of a hectare-sized plot set apart for the Mormon deceased in the Vienna Central Cemetery, on 19 September 2009. 
== Access ==
Private car traffic is allowed on the cemetery grounds every day of the year except 1 November (All Saint&#x27;s Day), although vehicles must pay a . Because of the large number of visitors on 1 November, private vehicles are not permitted. A public &quot;cemetery bus&quot; line (Route 106) operates on the grounds with several stops. The old Simmering horse tram was replaced by an electric tram, running from Schwarzenbergplatz to the Central Cemetery, in 1901 and it was renumbered as &quot;71&quot; &quot;(der 71er)&quot; in 1907; it remains the most popular route to the cemetery by public transport. The &quot;Zentralfriedhof&quot; stop on the Vienna S-Bahn (metro suburban railway) is close to the old Jewish part of the cemetery. The closest underground stop is &quot;Simmering&quot; (Vienna U-Bahn, line U3), about from the cemetery.

== Cultural references ==
The cemetery is the scene of Harry Lime&#x27;s fake and real funeral at the beginning and end of &quot;The Third Man&quot;. The musician Wolfgang Ambros credited the cemetery in his 1975 song &quot;Es lebe der Zentralfriedhof&quot; (&quot;Long live the Central Cemetery&quot;), marking with it the 100th anniversary of its opening.

<text>John William Money (8 July 1921 – 7 July 2006) was a New Zealand American psychologist, sexologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University known for his research on human sexual behavior and gender. Believing that gender identity was malleable within the first two years of life, Money advocated for the surgical &quot;normalization&quot; of the genitalia of intersex infants.

Money advanced the use of more accurate terminology in sex research, coining the terms &quot;gender role&quot; and &quot;sexual orientation&quot;. Despite widespread popular belief, Money did not coin the term &quot;gender identity&quot;. Money pioneered drug treatment for sex offenders to extinguish their sex drives.

Since the 1990s, Money&#x27;s work and research has been subject to significant academic and public scrutiny. A 1997 academic study criticized Money&#x27;s work in many respects, particularly in regard to the involuntary sex-reassignment of the child David Reimer. Money allegedly coerced David and his brother Brian to perform sexual rehearsal with each other, which Money then photographed. David Reimer lived a troubled life, ending with his suicide at 38 following his brother&#x27;s suicide.

Money believed that transgender people had an &quot;idée fixe&quot;, and established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965. He screened adult patients for two years prior to granting them a medical transition, and believed sex roles should be de-stereotyped, so that masculine women would be less likely to desire transition. Money is generally viewed as a negative figure by the transgender community. 

Money&#x27;s writing has been translated into many languages and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. He received around 65 honors, awards and degrees in his lifetime.

==Early life==
Money was born in Morrinsville, New Zealand, to a Christian fundamentalist family of English and Welsh descent. His parents were members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. He attended Hutt Valley High School and initially studied psychology at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with a double master&#x27;s degree in psychology and education in 1944. He was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the University of Otago in Dunedin.

Author Janet Frame attended some of Money&#x27;s classes at the University of Otago, as part of her teacher training. Frame was attracted to Money, and eager to please him. In October 1945, after Frame wrote an essay mentioning her thoughts of suicide, Money convinced Frame to enter the psychiatric ward at Dunedin Hospital, where she was misdiagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. Frame then spent eight years in psychiatric institutions, during which she was subjected to electroshock and insulin shock therapy. Frame narrowly missed being lobotomized. In Frame&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot;, Money is referred to as John Forrest.

== Career and views ==
In 1947, at the age of 26, Money emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the University of Pittsburgh. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from Harvard University in 1952. 

Money became a professor of pediatrics and medical psychology at Johns Hopkins University, where he worked from 1952 until his death. 

Money proposed and developed several theories related to the topics of gender identity and gender roles, and coined terms like gender role and lovemap. He popularised the term &quot;paraphilia&quot; (appearing in the DSM-III, which would later replace &quot;perversions&quot;) and introduced the term &quot;sexual orientation&quot; in place of &quot;sexual preference&quot;, arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice. Although often misattributed to him, Money did not coin the term &quot;&#x27;gender identity&quot;&#x27;.

In 1960 and 1961, he co-authored two papers with Richard Green.

Money pioneered the use of drug treatment for sex offenders to extinguish their sex drives. According to a 1987 paper, he employed the drug Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) for use on sex offenders at Johns Hopkins beginning in 1966. The practice later spread in the United States and Europe. 

===Sex reassignment of David Reimer===
In 1966, a botched circumcision left eight-month-old Reimer without a penis. Money persuaded the baby&#x27;s parents that sex reassignment surgery would be in Reimer&#x27;s best interest. At the age of 22 months, Reimer underwent an orchiectomy, in which his testicles were surgically removed. He was reassigned to be raised as female and his name changed from Bruce to Brenda. Money further recommended hormone treatment, to which the parents agreed. Money then recommended a surgical procedure to create an artificial vagina, which the parents refused. Money published a number of papers reporting the reassignment as successful. David Reimer was raised under the &quot;optimum gender rearing model&quot; which was the common model for sex and gender socialization/medicalization for intersex youth. The model was heavily criticized for being sexist, and for assigning an arbitrary gender binary.

According to John Colapinto&#x27;s biography of David Reimer, starting when Reimer and his twin Brian were six years old, Money showed the brothers pornography and forced the two to rehearse sexual acts. Money would order David to get down on all fours and Brian was forced to &quot;come up behind [him] and place his crotch against [his] buttocks&quot;. Money also forced Reimer, in another sexual position, to have his &quot;legs spread&quot; with Brian on top. On &quot;at least one occasion&quot; Money took a photograph of the two children performing these acts.

When either child resisted Money, Money would get angry. Both Reimer and Brian recall that Money was mild-mannered around their parents, but ill-tempered when alone with them. Money also forced the two children to strip for &quot;genital inspections&quot;; when they resisted inspecting each other&#x27;s genitals, Money got very aggressive. Reimer says, &quot;He told me to take my clothes off, and I just did not do it. I just stood there. And he screamed, &#x27;Now!&#x27; Louder than that. I thought he was going to give me a whupping. So I took my clothes off and stood there shaking.&quot;

Colapinto speculates that Money&#x27;s rationale for his treatment of the children was his belief that &quot;childhood &#x27;sexual rehearsal play″ at thrusting movements and copulation&quot; was important for a &quot;healthy adult gender identity&quot;. Brian spoke about the therapy &quot;only with the greatest emotional turmoil&quot;, and David was unwilling to speak about the details publicly.

At 14 years old and in extreme psychological agony, David Reimer was told the truth by his parents. He chose to begin calling himself David, and he underwent surgical procedures to revert the female bodily modifications.

Despite the pain and turmoil of the brothers, for decades, Money reported on Reimer&#x27;s progress as the &quot;John/Joan case&quot;, describing apparently successful female gender development and using this case to support the feasibility of sex reassignment and surgical reconstruction even in non-intersex cases.

By the time this deception was discovered, the idea of a purely socially constructed gender identity and infant Intersex medical interventions had become the accepted medical and sociological standard.

David Reimer&#x27;s case came to international attention in 1997 when he told his story to Milton Diamond, an academic sexologist, who persuaded Reimer to allow him to report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly. Soon after, Reimer went public with his story, and John Colapinto published a widely disseminated and influential account in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in December 1997. This was later expanded into &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestselling biography &quot;As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl&quot; (2000), in which Colapinto described how—contrary to Money&#x27;s reports—when living as Brenda, Reimer did not identify as a girl. He was ostracized and bullied by peers (who dubbed him &quot;cavewoman&quot;), and neither frilly dresses nor female hormones made him feel female.

In July 2002, Brian was found dead from an overdose of antidepressants. In May 2004, David committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a sawed-off shotgun at the age of 38. According to his mother, &quot;he had recently become depressed after losing his job and separating from his wife.&quot;

Money argued that media response to Diamond&#x27;s exposé was due to right-wing media bias and &quot;the antifeminist movement.&quot; He said his detractors believed &quot;masculinity and femininity are built into the genes so women should get back to the mattress and the kitchen&quot;. However, intersex activists also criticized Money, stating that the unreported failure had led to the surgical reassignment of thousands of infants as a matter of policy. Privately, Money was mortified by the case, colleagues said, and as a rule did not discuss it.

Money had a particular interest in gender dysphoria and transgender people. He believed transgender people had an &quot;Idée fixe&quot;; a preoccupation of the mind resistant to change.

According to Goldie, Money is seen as a &quot;negative figure&quot; among transgender people. In one paper, Money described trans women as &quot;devious, demanding and manipulative in their relationships with people on whom they are also dependent&quot; and “possibly also incapable of love.”

Money believed that de-stereotyping sex roles might prevent people from wanting to transition, arguing “a tomboy-ish girl, prenatally androgenized, grows up to be a career-minded woman, not a transsexual who claims to need sex reassignment”.

In 1965, Money co-established the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins with the endocrinologist Claude Migeon. Money screened adult patients for two years prior to granting them a medical transition, and argued that none regret the procedure as a result. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966, and was the first clinic in the United States to do so.

=== Homosexuality and sexual orientation ===
John Money was a leading proponent of the idea that human sexual orientation develops through learning and gendered socialization. He believed that males, if surgically reassigned and raised as girls around birth, would grow up to be attracted to males and live as heterosexual women. However, in the case of David Reimer, he grew up to be attracted to women. A 2016 academic review found that in seven total cases of boys surgically reassigned and raised as girls (due to botched circumcision or cloacal exstrophy), all were strongly attracted to women, not men, inconsistent with this learning theory of homosexuality.

===Chronophilias===
Money coined the term chronophilia and nepiophilia (sexual attraction to toddlers and infants) in 1986. In two 1983 case study publications, Money stated that pedophilia, among other chronophilias, could be characterized as combining &quot;devotion, affection, and limerence&quot;, &quot;comradeship with a touch of hero-worship&quot; and ultimately as &quot;harmless... in most instances&quot;.&quot;&quot;

He stated that both sexual researchers and the public do not make distinctions between affectional pedophilia and sadistic pedophilia. According to Colapinto, Money told &quot;Paidika&quot;, a now defunct Dutch journal of pedophilia, that:

Also in 1986, Money postulated the existence of multiple chronophilic forms of erotic age-roleplaying, or age impersonation, which he named &quot;&quot;&quot;infantilism&quot;, &quot;juvenilism&quot;, &quot;adolescentilism&quot;, &quot;gerontilism&quot;&quot;.&quot;

==Books on sexology==

Money co-edited a 1969 book, &quot;Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment&quot;, which helped bring more acceptance to sexual reassignment surgery and transsexual individuals.

Money introduced numerous definitions related to gender in journal articles in the 1950s, many of them as a result of his studies of intersex morphology. His definition of gender is based on his understanding of sex differences among human beings. According to Money, the fact that one sex produces ova and the other sex produces sperm is the irreducible criterion of sex difference. However, there are other &quot;sex-derivative differences&quot; that follow in the wake of this primary dichotomy. These differences involve the way urine is expelled from the human body and other questions of sexual dimorphism. According to Money&#x27;s theory, &quot;sex-adjunctive differences&quot; are typified by the smaller size of females and their problems in moving around while nursing infants. This then makes it more likely that the males do the roaming and hunting.

&quot;Sex-arbitrary differences&quot; are those that are purely conventional: for example, color selection (baby blue for boys, pink for girls). Some of the latter differences apply to life activities, such as career opportunities for men versus women. Finally, Money created the now-common term &quot;gender role&quot; which he differentiated from the concept of the more traditional terminology &quot;sex role&quot;. This grew out of his studies of intersex people.

In his studies of intersex people, Money alleged that there are six variables that define sex. While in the average person all six would line up unequivocally as either all &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;, in an intersex person any one or more than one of these could be inconsistent with the others, leading to various kinds of anomalies. In his seminal 1955 paper he defined these factors as:
# assigned sex and sex of rearing
# external genital morphology
# internal reproductive structures
# hormonal and secondary sex characteristics
# gonadal sex
# chromosomal sex

and added, 

He then defined gender role as; 
Money made the concept of &quot;gender&quot; a broader, more inclusive concept than one of masculine/feminine. For him, gender included not only one&#x27;s status as a man or a woman, but was also a matter of personal recognition, social assignment, or legal determination; not only on the basis of one&#x27;s genitalia but also on the basis of somatic and behavioral criteria that go beyond genital differences. In 1972, Money presented his theories in &quot;Man and Woman, Boy and Girl&quot;, a college level textbook. The book featured David Reimer as an example of gender reassignment.
In his book &quot;Gay, Straight and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation&quot;, Money develops a conception of &quot;bodymind&quot;. &quot;Bodymind&quot; is a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between nature versus nurture, innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggested that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term &quot;bodymind&quot;, in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.

Money also developed a view of &quot;Concepts of Determinism&quot; which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise. These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication. Money suggested that the concept of &quot;threshold&quot; – the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior – is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. &quot;It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback).&quot;

== Personal life ==
 Money was briefly married in the 1950s and never had any children. He was reportedly bisexual.

According to his friends, Money lived an &quot;eccentric lifestyle.&quot; He only bought secondhand clothing and rarely threw things away he deemed reusable. For over 40 years, Money lived in a house in Baltimore near the Johns Hopkins medical campus. His house had a collection of anthropological art from his travels abroad, including his studies of aboriginal communities in Australia. Money was an early supporter and patron of many famous artists, including New Zealand artists Rita Angus and Theo Schoon, and the American artist Lowell Nesbitt, whom he provided with an x-ray for one artwork. Money was also acquainted with Yoko Ono, visiting her in London with Richard Green, and fashioning some of her sculptures. 

In 2002, as his Parkinson&#x27;s disease worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the Eastern Southland Art Gallery in Gore, New Zealand. In 2003, the New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark opened the John Money wing at the gallery.

Money died on 7 July 2006, one day before his 85th birthday, in Towson, Maryland, of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was survived by eight nieces and nephews.

==In media==

The &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Identity&quot; (2005) was based on David and Brian Reimer&#x27;s lives and their treatment by Money.

The Money and Reimer case was highlighted in the 2023 documentary &quot;Every Body&quot;, in which intersex individuals (&quot;aka &quot;individuals with Differences of Sexual Development) describe growing up and their struggles due to their gender being mis-identified.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="285549" wikidata="Q425166" url="?curid=285549" title="Milton Diamond">
<text>Milton Diamond (March 6, 1934 – March 20, 2024) was an American professor of anatomy and reproductive biology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. After a career in the study of human sexuality, Diamond retired from the university in December 2009 but continued with his research and writing until retiring fully in 2018. He died on March 20, 2024, at the age of 90.

==Early career==
Milton Diamond graduated from the City College of New York with a BS in biophysics in 1955, after which he spent three years in the Army as an engineering officer, stationed in Japan. On returning to the United States, he attended graduate school at University of Kansas from 1958 to 1962 where he earned a PhD in anatomy and psychology. His first job was teaching at the University of Louisville, School of Medicine where he simultaneously completed two years toward a Doctor of Medicine, passing his Basic Medicine Boards, and in 1967 he moved to Hawaii to take up a post at the recently established John A. Burns School of Medicine.

Milton Diamond had a long running feud with the psychologist Dr. John Money. In 1965 Diamond published &quot;A Critical Evaluation of the Ontogeny of Human Sexual Behavior &quot; a critique of Money&#x27;s work. In the early seventies, Diamond and Money were attending a conference on transgenderism in Dubrovnik. According to the book &quot;As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl&quot; (page 174) at this conference Money initiated a loud and aggressive argument with Diamond. Eyewitnesses claimed Money punched Diamond; however, Diamond himself said that he could not recall any physical contact during this encounter.

==David Reimer==
Diamond was best known for following up on the case of David Reimer, a boy raised as a girl under the supervision of John Money after his penis was damaged beyond surgical repair during a botched circumcision, which was performed using an unconventional method of electrocauterization instead of a clamp and scalpel. This case, which Money renamed that of &quot;John/Joan&quot; to protect Reimer&#x27;s privacy, has become one of the most cited cases in the literature of psychiatry, anthropology, women&#x27;s studies, child development, and biology of gender. With the cooperation of H. Keith Sigmundson, who had been Reimer&#x27;s supervising psychiatrist, Diamond tracked down the adult Reimer and found that Money&#x27;s sex reassignment of Reimer had failed. Diamond was the first to alert physicians that the model, proposed by Reimer&#x27;s case, of how to treat infants with intersex conditions was faulty. 

Diamond recommended that physicians should not perform surgery on intersex people without their informed consent, should assign such infants to the gender to which they will probably best adjust, and refrain from adding shame, stigma and secrecy to the issue, by assisting intersex people to meet and associate with others of like condition. Diamond similarly encouraged considering the intersex condition as a difference of sex development, not as a disorder.

==Work, appointments and awards==
Diamond wrote extensively about abortion and family planning, pornography, intersexuality, transsexuality, and other sex- and reproduction-related issues for professional sex and legal journals, as well as lay periodicals. He was frequently interviewed for public media and legal matters, and often served as an expert in court proceedings, and was known for his research on the origins and development of sexual identity. He retired from teaching in 2009, but continued to research and consult concerning transsexuality, intersexuality and pornography until he retired fully in 2018.
