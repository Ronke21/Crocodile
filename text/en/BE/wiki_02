<text>Matthias Corvinus (; ; ; ; ; ) was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1458 to 1490, as Matthias I. He is often given the epithet &quot;the Just&quot;. After conducting several military campaigns, he was elected King of Bohemia in 1469 and adopted the title Duke of Austria in 1487. He was the son of John Hunyadi, Regent of Hungary, who died in 1456. In 1457, Matthias was imprisoned along with his older brother, Ladislaus Hunyadi, on the orders of King Ladislaus the Posthumous. Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed, causing a rebellion that forced King Ladislaus to flee Hungary. After the King died unexpectedly, Matthias&#x27;s uncle Michael Szilágyi persuaded the Estates to unanimously proclaim the 14-year-old Matthias as king on 24 January 1458. He began his rule under his uncle&#x27;s guardianship, but he took effective control of government within two weeks.

As king, Matthias waged wars against the Czech mercenaries who dominated Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating the zone of buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor&#x27;s right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.

Matthias introduced new taxes and regularly set taxation at extraordinary levels. These measures caused a rebellion in Transylvania in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias declared war on George of Poděbrady, the Hussite King of Bohemia, and conquered Moravia, Silesia, and Lusatia, but he could not occupy Bohemia proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of their leader George of Poděbrady in 1471. Instead, they elected Vladislaus Jagiellon, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus&#x27;s younger brother Casimir, but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at Breslau in Silesia (now Wrocław in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, Prince of Moldavia, enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized Šabac, an important Ottoman border fort. He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied Lower Austria between 1482 and 1487.

Matthias established one of the earliest professional standing armies of medieval Europe (the Black Army of Hungary), reformed the administration of justice, reduced the power of the barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the &quot;Bibliotheca Corviniana&quot;, was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to embrace the Renaissance from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian and Slovak folk tales.

==Early life==


===Childhood (1443–1457)===

Matthias was born in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 23 February 1443. He was the second son of John Hunyadi and his wife, Elizabeth Szilágyi. Matthias&#x27; education was managed by his mother due to his father&#x27;s absence. Many of the most learned men of Central Europe, including Gregory of Sanok and John Vitéz, frequented John Hunyadi&#x27;s court when Matthias was a child. Gregory of Sanok, a former tutor of King Vladislaus III of Poland, was Matthias&#x27;s only teacher whose name is known. Under these scholars&#x27; influences, Matthias became an enthusiastic supporter of Renaissance humanism.

As a child, Matthias learnt many languages and read classical literature, especially military treatises. According to Antonio Bonfini, Matthias &quot;was versed in all the tongues of Europe&quot;, with the exceptions of Turkish and Greek. Although this was an exaggeration, it is without doubt that Matthias spoke Hungarian, Latin, Italian, Polish, Czech, and German. Bonfini also wrote that he needed an interpreter to speak with a POW during his Moldavian campaign. On the other hand, the late 16th-century Polish historian Krzystoff Warszewiecki wrote that Matthias had been able to understand the Romanian language of the envoys of Stephen the Great, Prince of Moldavia.

According to a treaty between John Hunyadi and Đurađ Branković, Despot of Serbia, Matthias and the Despot&#x27;s granddaughter Elizabeth of Celje were engaged on 7 August 1451. Elizabeth was the daughter of Ulrich II, Count of Celje, who was related to King Ladislaus the Posthumous and an opponent of Matthias&#x27;s father. Because of new conflicts between Hunyadi and Ulrich of Celje, the marriage of their children only took place in 1455. Elizabeth settled in the Hunyadis&#x27; estates but Matthias was soon sent to the royal court, implying that their marriage was a hidden exchange of hostages between their families. Elizabeth died before the end of 1455.

John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, less than three weeks after his greatest victory over the Ottomans in Belgrade. John&#x27;s elder son, who was Matthias&#x27;s brother, Ladislaus became the head of the family. Ladislaus&#x27;s conflict with Ulrich of Celje ended with Ulrich&#x27;s capture and assassination on 9 November. Under duress, the King promised he would never take his revenge against the Hunyadis for Ulrich&#x27;s killing. However, the murder turned most barons, including Palatine Ladislaus Garai, Judge royal Ladislaus Pálóci, and Nicholas Újlaki, Voivode of Transylvania, against Ladislaus Hunyadi. Taking advantage of their resentment, the King had the Hunyadi brothers imprisoned in Buda on 14 March 1457. The royal council condemned them to death for high treason and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March.

Matthias was held in captivity in a small house in Buda. His mother and her brother Michael Szilágyi staged a rebellion against the King and occupied large territories in the regions to the east of the river Tisza. King Ladislaus fled to Vienna in mid-1457, and from Vienna to Prague in September, taking Matthias with him. The civil war between the rebels and the barons loyal to the monarch continued until the sudden death of the young King on 23 November 1457. Thereafter the Hussite Regent of Bohemia, George of Poděbrady, held Matthias captive.
===Election as king (1457–1458)===
King Ladislaus died childless in 1457. His elder sister, Anna, and her husband, William III, Landgrave of Thuringia, laid claim to his inheritance but received no support from the Estates. The Diet of Hungary was convoked to Pest to elect a new king in January 1458. Pope Calixtus III&#x27;s legate Cardinal Juan Carvajal, who had been John Hunyadi&#x27;s admirer, began openly campaigning for Matthias.

The election of Matthias as king was the only way of avoiding a protracted civil war. Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield. At a meeting with Matthias&#x27;s mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias&#x27;s election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi&#x27;s execution. They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine&#x27;s daughter Anna, his executed brother&#x27;s bride.

Michael Szilágyi arrived at the Diet with 15,000 troops, intimidating the barons who assembled in Buda. Stirred up by Szilágyi, the noblemen gathered on the frozen River Danube and unanimously proclaimed the 14-year-old Matthias king on 24 January. At the same time, the Diet elected his uncle as regent.

==Reign==

===Early rule and consolidation (1458–1464)===


Matthias&#x27;s election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted the royal throne in Hungary. Michael Szilágyi sent John Vitéz to Prague to discuss the terms of Matthias&#x27;s release with George of Poděbrady. Poděbrady, whose daughter Katalin Matthias promised to marry, agreed to release his future son-in-law for a ransom of 60,000 gold florins. Matthias was surrendered to the Hungarian delegates in Strážnice on 9 February. With Poděbrady&#x27;s mediation, he was reconciled with John Jiskra of Brandýs, the commander of the Czech mercenaries who dominated most of Upper Hungary.

Matthias made his state entry into Buda five days later. He ceremoniously sat on the throne in the Church of Our Lady, but was not crowned, because the Holy Crown of Hungary had been in the possession of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor for almost two decades. The 14-year-old monarch administered state affairs independently from the outset, although he reaffirmed his uncle&#x27;s position as Regent. For instance, Matthias instructed the citizens of Nagyszeben (now Sibiu in Romania) to reconcile their differences with Vlad Dracula, Prince of Wallachia on 3 March.

Jiskra was the first baron who turned against Matthias. He offered the throne to Casimir IV of Poland, the husband of King Ladislaus V&#x27;s younger sister Elisabeth, in late March but the General sejm of Poland rejected his offer. Matthias&#x27;s commander Sebastian Rozgonyi defeated Jiskra&#x27;s soldiers at Sárospatak but the Ottomans&#x27; invasion of Serbia in April forced Matthias to conclude an armistice with the Czechs. They were allowed to keep Sáros Castle (now Šariš Castle, Slovakia) and other fortified places in Upper Hungary. Matthias sent two prelates, August Salánki, Bishop of Győr, and Vincent Szilasi, Bishop of Vác, to Prague to crown George of Poděbrady king. Upon their demand, the &quot;heretic&quot; Poděbrady swore loyalty to the Holy See.

Matthias&#x27;s first Diet assembled in Pest in May 1458. The Estates passed almost fifty decrees that were ratified by Matthias, instead of the Regent, on 8 June. One decree prescribed that the King &quot;must call and hold, and order to be held, a diet of all the gentlemen of the realm in person&quot; every year on Whitsunday. Matthias held more than 25 Diets during his reign and convoked the Estates more frequently than his predecessors, especially between 1458 and 1476. The Diets were controlled by the barons, whom Matthias appointed and dismissed at will. For instance, he dismissed Palatine Ladislaus Garai and persuaded Michael Szilágyi to resign from the Regency after they entered into a league in the summer of 1458. The King appointed Michael Ország, who had been his father&#x27;s close supporter, as the new Palatine. Most of Matthias&#x27;s barons were descended from old aristocratic families but he also promoted the careers of members of the lesser nobility, or even of skilful commoners. For instance, the noble Zápolya brothers Emeric and Stephen owed their fortunes to Matthias&#x27;s favour.

Matthias&#x27;s ordinary revenues amounted around 250,000 golden florins per year when his reign began. A decree passed at the Diet of 1458 explicitly prohibited the imposition of extraordinary taxes. However, an extraordinary tax, one golden florin per each &quot;porta&quot; or peasant household, was levied late that year. The Ottomans occupied the fort of Golubac in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen. He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes. King Stephen Thomas of Bosnia accepted Matthias&#x27;s suzerainty. Matthias authorized his new vassal&#x27;s son Stephen Tomašević to take possession of the parts of Serbia that had not been occupied by the Ottomans.

At the turn of 1458 and 1459, Matthias held a Diet at Szeged to prepare for a war against the Ottoman Empire. However, gossip about a conspiracy compelled him to return to Buda. The rumours proved to be true because at least 30 barons, including Ladislaus Garai, Nicholas Újlaki, and Ladislaus Kanizsai, met in Németújvár (now Güssing in Austria) and offered the throne to Emperor Frederick III on 17 February 1459. Even George of Poděbrady turned against Matthias when Frederick promised him to make him governor of the Holy Roman Empire. Although the joint troops of the Emperor and the rebellious lords defeated a royal army at Körmend on 27 March, Garai had by that time died, Újlaki and Sigismund Szentgyörgyvölgyi soon entered into negotiations with Matthias&#x27; envoys. Újlaki became indifferent, Szentgyörgyvölgyi joined to Matthias. Skirmishes along the western borderlands lasted for several months, preventing Matthias from providing military assistance to Tomašević against the Ottomans. The latter took Smederevo on 29 June, completing the conquest of Serbia.
Jiskra swore an oath of loyalty to Emperor Frederick on 10 March 1460. Pope Pius II offered to mediate a peace treaty between the Emperor and Matthias. Podedébrandy also realised he need to support Matthias or at least had to be indifferent. He sent his daughter to Buda also offered his assistance. The representatives of the Emperor and Matthias signed a truce in Olomouc in April 1460. The Pope soon offered financial support for an anti-Ottoman campaign. However, John Jiskra returned from Poland, renewing the armed conflicts with Czech mercenaries in early 1460. Matthias seized a newly-erected fort from the Czechs but he could not force them to obey him. The costs of his five-month-long campaign in Upper Hungary were paid for by an extraordinary tax.

Matthias entered into an alliance with the Emperor&#x27;s rebellious brother Albert VI, Archduke of Austria. George of Poděbrady sided with the Emperor although the marriage of his daughter, who became known as Catherine in Hungary, to Matthias was celebrated on 1 May 1461(married 1461 to 1464). Relations between Matthias and his father-in-law deteriorated because of the Czech mercenaries&#x27; continued presence in Upper Hungary. Matthias launched a new campaign against them after the Diet authorized him to collect an extraordinary tax in mid-1461. However, he did not defeat Jiskra, who even captured Késmárk (now Kežmarok, Slovakia).

The envoys of Matthias and Emperor Frederick agreed the terms of peace treaty on 3 April 1462. According to the agreement, the Emperor was to return the Holy Crown of Hungary for 80,000 golden florins, but his right to use the title King of Hungary along with Matthias was confirmed. In accordance with the treaty, the Emperor adopted Matthias, which granted him the right to succeed his &quot;son&quot; if Matthias died without a legitimate heir. Within a month, Jiskra yielded to Matthias. He surrendered all the forts he held in Upper Hungary to the King&#x27;s representatives; as compensation, he received a large domain near the Tisza and Arad and 25,000 golden florins. That happened before the peace treaty with Frederick. To pay the large amounts stipulated in his treaties with the Emperor and Jiskra, Matthias collected an extraordinary tax with the consent of the Royal Council. The Diet, which assembled in mid-1462, confirmed this decision but only after 9 prelates and 19 barons promised that no extraordinary taxes would be introduced thereafter. Through hiring mercenaries among Jiskra&#x27;s companions, Matthias began organizing a professional army, which became known as the &quot;Black Army&quot; in following decades. The peace treaty made in Wiener-Neustadt 19 July 1463.

Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II invaded Wallachia in early 1462. He did not conquer the country but the Wallachian boyars dethroned the anti-Ottoman Vlad Dracula and replaced him with the Sultan&#x27;s favorite, Radu the Fair. The new Prince was willing to grant concessions to the Transylvanian Saxon merchants, who had come into bitter conflict with Vlad Dracula. The latter sought assistance from Matthias and they met in Brassó (now Brașov, Romania) in November. However, the Saxons presented Matthias with a letter that was allegedly written by Vlad Dracula to Sultan Mehmed in which the Prince offered his support to the Ottomans. Convinced of Vlad Dracula&#x27;s treachery, Matthias had him imprisoned.

In preparation for a war against the Ottomans, Matthias held a Diet at Tolna in March 1463. Although the Estates authorized him to levy an extraordinary tax of one florin, he did not intervene when Mehmed II invaded Bosnia in June. In a month, the Ottomans murdered King Stephen Tomašević and conquered the whole country. Matthias adopted an offensive foreign policy only after the terms of his peace with Emperor Frederick had been ratified in Wiener Neustadt on 19 July 1463. He led his troops to Bosnia and conquered Jajce and other forts in its northern parts. The conquered regions were organized into new defensive provinces, the banates of Jajce and Srebrenik. Matthias was assisted by Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, Grand Duke of Bosnia, who controlled the area of modern and Old Hercegovina. A former vassal to the Bosnian kings, Stjepan accepted Matthias&#x27;s suzerainty.

Queen Catherine died in early 1464 during preparations for her husband&#x27;s coronation with the Holy Crown, which had been returned by Emperor Frederick. The ceremony was carried out in full accordance with the customary law of Hungary on 29 March 1464; Archbishop of Esztergom Dénes Szécsi ceremoniously put the Holy Crown on Matthias&#x27;s head in Székesfehérvár. At the Diet assembled on this occasion, the newly crowned King confirmed the liberties of the nobility. Hereafter the legality of Matthias&#x27;s reign could not be questioned.

===First reforms and internal conflicts (1464–1467)===

====Political reforms====
Matthias dismissed his Chief Chancellor Archbishop Szécsi, replacing him with Stephen Várdai, Archbishop of Kalocsa, and John Vitéz. Both prelates bore the title of Chief and Secret Chancellor, but Várdai was the actual leader of the Royal Chancery. Around the same time, Matthias united the superior courts of justice, the Court of Royal Special Presence and the Court of Personal Presence, into one supreme court. The new supreme court diminished the authority of the traditional courts presided over by the barons and contributed to the professionalization of the administration of justice. He appointed Albert Hangácsi, Bishop of Csanád as the first Chief Justice.

Sultan Mehmed II returned to Bosnia and laid siege to Jajce in July 1464. Matthias began assembling his troops along the River Sava, forcing the Sultan to raise the siege on 24 August. Matthias and his army crossed the river and seized Srebrenica. He also besieged Zvornik, but the arrival of a large Ottoman army forced him to withdraw to Hungary. The following year, Matthias forced Stefan Vukčić, who had transferred Makarska Krajina to the Republic of Venice, to establish Hungarian garrisons in his forts along the river Neretva.

Dénes Szécsi died in 1465 and John Vitéz became the new Archbishop of Esztergom. Matthias replaced the two Voivodes of Transylvania (Nicholas Újlaki and John Pongrác of Dengeleg) with Counts Sigismund and John Szentgyörgyi, and Bertold Ellerbach. Although Újlaki preserved his office of Ban of Macsó, the King appointed Peter Szokoli to administer the province together with the old Ban.

Matthias convoked the Diet to make preparations for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466. For the same purpose, he received subsidies from Pope Paul II. However, Matthias had realized that no substantial aid could be expected from the Christian powers and tacitly gave up his anti-Ottoman foreign policy. He did not invade Ottoman territory and the Ottomans did not make major incursions into Hungary, implying that he signed a peace treaty with Mehmed II&#x27;s envoy who arrived in Hungary in 1465.

Matthias visited Slavonia and dismissed the two Bans Nicholas Újlaki and Emeric Zápolya, replacing them with Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466. Early the following year, he mounted a campaign in Upper Hungary against a band of Czech mercenaries who were under the command of Ján Švehla and had seized Kosztolány (now Veľké Kostoľany in Slovakia). Matthias routed them and had Švehla and his 150 comrades hanged.

====Economic reforms====

At the Diet of March 1467, two traditional taxes were renamed; the chamber&#x27;s profit was thereafter collected as tax of the royal treasury and the thirtieth as the Crown&#x27;s customs. Because of this change, all previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues. Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues. He entrusted the administration of the Crown&#x27;s customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant. Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all ordinary and extraordinary taxes, and the management of the salt mines.

Matthias&#x27;s tax reform caused a revolt in Transylvania. The representatives of the &quot;Three Nations&quot; of the province (the noblemen, the Saxons and the Székelys) formed an alliance against the King in Kolozsmonostor (now Mănăștur district in Cluj-Napoca, Romania) on 18 August, stating that they were willing to fight for the freedom of Hungary. Matthias assembled his troops immediately and hastened to the province. The rebels surrendered without resistance but Matthias severely punished their leaders, many of whom were impaled, beheaded, or mercilessly tortured upon his orders. Suspecting that Stephen the Great had supported the rebellion, Matthias invaded Moldavia. However, Stephen&#x27;s forces routed Matthias&#x27;s at the Battle of Baia on 15 December 1467. Matthias suffered severe injuries, forcing him to return to Hungary.

=== War for the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1468–1479) ===

Matthias&#x27;s former brother-in-law Victor of Poděbrady invaded Austria in early 1468. Emperor Frederick appealed to Matthias for support, hinting at the possibility of Matthias&#x27;s election as King of the Romans, the first step towards the imperial throne. Matthias declared war on Victor&#x27;s father King George of Bohemia on 31 March. He said he also wanted to help the Czech Catholic lords against their &quot;heretic monarch&quot;, whom the Pope had excommunicated. Matthias expelled the Czech troops from Austria and invaded Moravia and Silesia. He took an active part in the fighting; he was injured during the siege of Třebíč in May 1468 and was captured at Chrudim while spying out the enemy camp in disguise in February 1469. On the latter occasion, he was released because he made his custodians believe he was a local Czech groom.

The Diet of 1468 authorized Matthias to levy an extraordinary tax to finance the new war but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King&#x27;s behalf that he would not demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine&#x27;s eyre in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants, but he soon authorised the county to redeem the cancellation of the irksome duty.

The Czech Catholics, who were led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady&#x27;s army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened negotiations with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel in which Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including the appointment of a Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Poděbrady.

The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady.

Matthias&#x27;s relations with Frederick III had in the meantime deteriorated because the Emperor accused Matthias of allowing the Ottomans to march through Slavonia when raiding the Emperor&#x27;s realms. The Frangepan family, whose domains in Croatia were exposed to Ottoman raids, entered into negotiations with the Emperor and the Republic of Venice. In 1469, Matthias sent an army to Croatia to prevent the Venetians from seizing the Adriatic coastal town Senj.

Matthias expelled George of Poděbrady&#x27;s troops from Silesia. Matthias&#x27;s army was encircled and routed at Uherský Brod on 2 November, forcing him to withdraw to Hungary. Matthias soon ordered the collection of an extraordinary tax without holding a Diet, raising widespread discontent among the Hungarian Estates. He visited Emperor Frederick in Vienna on 11 February 1470, hoping the Emperor would contribute to the costs of the war against Poděbrady. Although the negotiations lasted for a month, no compromise was worked out. The Emperor also refused to commit himself to promoting Matthias&#x27;s election as King of the Romans. After a month, Matthias left Vienna without taking formal leave of Frederick III.

Having realised the Hungarian Estates&#x27; growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy an extraordinary tax, stipulating that the sum of all taxes payable per &quot;porta&quot; could not exceed one florin. The Estates also made it clear that they opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus&#x27;s election void and confirmed Matthias&#x27;s position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias&#x27;s claim.

Matthias was staying in Moravia when he was informed that a group of Hungarian prelates and barons had offered the throne to Casimir, a younger son of King Casimir IV of Poland. The conspiracy was initiated by Archbishop John Vitéz and his nephew Janus Pannonius, Bishop of Pécs, who opposed war against the Catholic Vladislaus Jagiellon. Initially, their plan was supported by the majority of the Estates, but nobody dared to rebel against Matthias, enabling him to return to Hungary without resistance. Matthias held a Diet and promised to refrain from levying taxes without the consent of the Estates and to convoke the Diet in each year. His promises remedied most of the Estates&#x27; grievances and almost 50 barons and prelates confirmed their loyalty to him on 21 September. Casimir Jagiellon invaded on 2 October 1471. With Bishop Janus Pannonius&#x27;s support, he seized Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), but only two barons, John Rozgonyi and Nicholas Perényi, joined him. Within five months Prince Casimir withdrew from Hungary, Bishop Janus Pannonius died while fleeing, and Archbishop John Vitéz was forbidden to leave his see. Matthias appointed the Silesian Johann Beckensloer to administer the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Vitéz died and Beckensloer succeeded him in a year.

The Ottomans had meanwhile seized the Hungarian forts along the river Nertva. Matthias nominated the wealthy baron Nicholas Újlaki as King of Bosnia in 1471, entrusting the defence of the province to him. Uzun Hassan, head of the Aq Qoyunlu Turkmens, proposed an anti-Ottoman alliance to Matthias but he refrained from attacking the Ottoman Empire. Matthias supported the Austrian noblemen who rebelled against Emperor Frederick in 1472. The following year, Matthias, Casimir IV and Vladislaus entered into negotiations on the terms of a peace treaty, but the discussions lasted for months. Matthias tried to unify the government of Silesia, which consisted of dozens of smaller duchies, through appointing a captain-general. However, the Estates refused to elect his candidate Duke Frederick I of Liegnitz.

Ali Bey Mihaloğlu, Bey of Smederevo, pillaged eastern parts of Hungary, destroyed Várad, and took 16,000 prisoners with him in January 1474. The next month, the envoys of Matthias and Casimir IV signed a peace treaty and a three-year truce between Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon was also declared. Within a month, however, Vladislaus entered into an alliance with Emperor Frederick and Casimir IV joined them. Casimir IV and Vladislaus invaded Silesia and laid siege to Matthias in Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland) in October. He prevented the besiegers from accumulating provisions, forcing them to raise the siege. Thereafter the Silesian Estates willingly elected Matthias&#x27;s new candidate Stephen Zápolya as captain-general. The Moravian Estates elected Ctibor Tovačovský as captain-general. Matthias confirmed this decision, although Tovačovský had been Vladislaus Jagiellon&#x27;s partisan.

The Ottomans invaded Wallachia and Moldavia at the end of 1474. Matthias sent reinforcements under the command of Blaise Magyar to Stephen the Great. Their united forces routed the invaders in the Battle of Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Fearing a new Ottoman invasion, the Prince of Moldavia swore fealty to Matthias on 15 August. Sultan Mehmed II proposed peace but Matthias refused him. Instead, he stormed into Ottoman territory and captured Šabac, an important fort on the river Száva, on 15 February 1476. During the siege, Matthias barely escaped capture while he was watching the fortress from a boat.

For unknown reasons, Archbishop Johann Beckensloer left Hungary, taking the treasury of the Esztergom See with him in early 1476. He fled to Vienna and offered his funds to the Emperor. Matthias accused the Emperor of having incited the Archbishop against him.

Mehmed II launched a campaign against Moldavia in the summer of 1476. Although he won the Battle of Valea Albă on 26 July, the lack of provisions forced him to retreat. Matthias sent auxiliary troops to Moldavia under the command of Vlad Dracula, whom he had released, and Stephen Báthory The allied forces defeated an Ottoman army at the Siret River in August. With Hungarian and Moldavian support, Vlad Dracula was reinstalled as Prince of Wallachia but he was killed fighting against his opponent Basarab Laiotă.

Matthias&#x27;s bride Beatrice of Naples arrived in Hungary in late 1476. Matthias married her in Buda on 22 December that year. The Queen soon established a rigid etiquette, making direct contacts between the King and his subjects more difficult. According to Bonfini, Matthias also &quot;improved his board and manner of life, introduced sumptuous banquets, disdaining humility at home and beautified the dining rooms&quot; after his marriage. According to a contemporaneous record, around that time Matthias&#x27;s revenues amounted about 500,000 florins, half of which derived from the tax of the royal treasury and the extraordinary tax.

Matthias concluded an alliance with the Teutonic Knights and the Bishopric of Ermland against Poland in March 1477. However, instead of Poland, he declared war on Emperor Frederick after he learnt that the Emperor had confirmed Vladislaus Jagiellon&#x27;s position as King of Bohemia and Prince-elector. Matthias invaded Lower Austria and imposed a blockade on Vienna. Vladislaus Jagiellon denied to support the Emperor, forcing him to seek reconciliation with Matthias. With the mediation of Pope Sixtus IV, Venice, and Ferdinand I of Naples, Matthias concluded a peace treaty with Frederick III, which was signed on 1 December. The Emperor promised to confirm Matthias as the lawful ruler of Bohemia and to pay him an indemnity of 100,000 florins. They met in Korneuburg where Frederick III installed Matthias as King of Bohemia and Matthias swore loyalty to the Emperor.

Negotiations between the envoys of Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon accelerated during the next few months. The first draft of a treaty was agreed upon on 28 March 1478, and the text was completed by the end of 1477. The treaty authorized both monarchs to use the title of King of Bohemia although Vladislaus could omit to style Matthias as such in their correspondence, and the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were divided between them. Vladislaus ruled in Bohemia proper and Matthias in Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia. They solemnly ratified the peace treaty at their meeting in Olomouc on 21 July.

===War for Austria (1479–1487)===


Emperor Frederick only paid off half of the indemnity due to Matthias according to their treaty of 1477. Matthias concluded a treaty with the Swiss Confederacy on 26 March 1479, hindering the recruitment of Swiss mercenaries by the Emperor. He also entered into an alliance with Archbishop of Salzburg Bernhard II of Rohr, who allowed him to take possession of the fortresses of the Archbishopric in Carinthia, Carniola and Styria.

An Ottoman army supported by Basarab Țepeluș of Wallachia invaded Transylvania and set fire to Szászváros (now Orăștie in Romania) in late 1479. Stephen Báthory and Paul Kinizsi annihilated the marauders in the Battle of Breadfield on 13 October. Matthias united the command of all forts along the Danube to the west of Belgrade in the hand of Paul Kinizsi to improve the defence of the southern frontier. Matthias sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, who invaded pro-Ottoman Wallachia in early 1480; Matthias launched a campaign as far as Sarajevo in Bosnia in November. He set up five defensive provinces, or banates, centred around the forts of Szörényvár (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), Belgrade, Šabac, Srebrenik and Jajce. The next year, Matthias initiated a criminal case against the Frankapans, the Zrinskis and other leading Croatian and Slavonian magnates for their alleged participation in the 1471 conspiracy. Most barons were pardoned as soon as they consented to the introduction of a new land tax. In 1481, for a loan of 100,000 florins, Matthias seized the town of Mautern in Styria and Sankt Pölten in Lower Austria from Friedrich Mauerkircher, one of the two candidates to the Bishopric of Passau.

Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481. A civil war ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons Bayezid II and Cem. Defeated, Cem fled to Rhodes, where the Knights Hospitaller kept him in custody. Matthias claimed Cem&#x27;s custody in the hope of using him to gain concessions from Bayezid, but Venice and Pope Innocent VIII strongly opposed this plan. In late 1481, Hungarian auxiliary troops supported Matthias&#x27;s father-in-law Ferdinand I of Naples to reoccupy Otranto, which had been lost to the Ottomans the year before.

Although the &quot;Black Army&quot; had already laid siege to Hainburg an der Donau in January 1482, Matthias officially declared a new war on Emperor Frederick three months later. He directed the siege in person from the end of June and the town fell to him in October. In the next three months, Matthias also captured Sankt Veit an der Glan, Enzersdorf an der Fischa, and Kőszeg. The papal legate, Bartolomeo Maraschi tried to mediate a peace treaty between Matthias and the Emperor, but Matthias refused. Instead, he signed a five-year truce with Sultan Bayezid.

Matthias&#x27;s marriage to Beatrice of Naples did not produce sons; he tried to strengthen the position of his illegitimate son John Corvinus. The child received Sáros Castle and inherited the extensive domains of his grandmother Elizabeth Szilágyi with his father&#x27;s consent. Matthias also forced Victor of Poděbrady to renounce the Duchy of Troppau in Silesia in favour of John Corvinus in 1485. Queen Beatrice opposed Matthias&#x27;s favouritism towards his son. Even so, Matthias nominated her eight-year-old nephew Ippolito d&#x27;Este Archbishop of Esztergom. The Pope refused to confirm the child&#x27;s appointment for years. The &quot;Black Army&quot; encircled Vienna in January 1485. The siege lasted for five months and ended with the triumphal entry of Matthias, at the head of 8,000 veterans, into Vienna on 1 June. The King soon moved the royal court to the newly conquered town. He summoned the Estates of Lower Austria to Vienna and forced them to swear loyalty to him.

Upon the monarch&#x27;s initiative, the Diet of 1485 passed the so-called &quot;Decretum maius&quot;, a systematic law-code which replaced many previous contradictory decrees. The law-code introduced substantial reforms in the administration of justice; the Palatine&#x27;s eyre and the extraordinary county assemblies were abolished, which strengthened the position of the county courts. Matthias also decreed that in cases of the monarch&#x27;s absence or minority, the Palatine was authorized to rule as Regent.

Emperor Frederick persuaded six of the seven Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire to proclaim his son Maximilian King of the Romans on 16 February 1486. The Emperor, however, had failed to invite the King of Bohemia, either Matthias or Vladislaus Jagiellon, to the assembly. In an attempt to prevail on Vladislaus to protest, Matthias invited him to a personal meeting. Although they formed an alliance in Jihlava in September, the Estates of Bohemia refused to confirm it and Vladislaus recognized Maximilian&#x27;s election.

In the meantime Matthias continued his war against the Emperor. The &quot;Black Army&quot; seized several towns in Lower Austria, including Laa an der Thaya, and Stein in 1485 and 1486. He set up his chancery for Lower Austria in 1486, but he never introduced a separate seal for this realm. Matthias assumed the title of Duke of Austria at the Diet of the Lower Austrian Estates in Ebenfurth in 1487. He appointed Stephen Zápolya captain-general, Urban Nagylucsei administrator of the Archdiocese of Vienna, and entrusted the defence of the occupied towns and forts to Hungarian and Bohemian captains, but otherwise continued to employ Emperor Frederick&#x27;s officials who accepted his rule. Wiener Neustadt, the last town resisting Matthias in Lower Austria, fell to him on 17 August 1487.

He started negotiations with Duke Albert III of Saxony, who arrived at the head of the imperial army to fight for Emperor Frederick III. They signed a six-month armistice in Sankt Pölten on 16 December, which ended the war. Matthias offered Emperor Frederick and his son prince Maximilian, the return of Austrian provinces and Vienna, if they would renounce the treaty of 1463 and accept Matthias as Frederic&#x27;s designated heir and probable the inheritor of the title of Holy Roman Emperor. Before this was settled though, Matthias died in Vienna in 1490.

King Matthias was happy to be described as &quot;the second Attila&quot;. The &quot;Chronica Hungarorum&quot; by Johannes Thuróczy published in 1488, set the goal of glorifying Attila, which was undeservedly neglected, moreover, he introduced the famous &quot;Scourge of God&quot; characterization to the later Hungarian writers, because the earlier chronicles remained hidden for a long time. Thuróczy worked hard to endear Attila, the Hun king with an effort far surpassing his predecessor chroniclers. He made Attila a model for his victorious ruler, King Matthias who had Attila&#x27;s abilities, with this he almost brought &quot;the hammer of the world&quot; to life.

===Last years (1487–1490)===
According to the contemporaneous Philippe de Commines, Matthias&#x27;s subjects feared their king in the last years of his life because he rarely showed mercy towards those he suspected of treachery. He had Archbishop Peter Váradi imprisoned in 1484 and ordered the execution of Chancellor of Bohemia Jaroslav Boskovic in 1485. He also imprisoned Nicholas Bánfi, a member of a magnate family, in 1487, although he had earlier avoided punishing the old aristocracy. Bánfi&#x27;s imprisonment seems to have been connected to his marriage to a daughter of John the Mad, Duke of Glogau because Matthias tried to seize this duchy for John Corvinus. John the Mad entered into an alliance with the Duke of Münsterberg Henry of Poděbrady, and declared a war on Matthias on 9 May. Six month later, the Black Army invaded and occupied his duchy.

In the meantime, the citizens of Ancona, a town in the Papal States, hoisted Matthias&#x27;s flag in the hope he would protect them against Venice. Pope Innocent VIII soon protested, but Matthias refused to reject the overture and stated that the link between him and the town would never harm the interests of the Holy See. He also sent an auxiliary troop to his father-in-law, who was waging a war against the Holy See and Venice. The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488. On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were to refrain from invading Wallachia and Moldavia. The following year, Matthias granted two domains to Stephen the Great of Moldavia in Transylvania.

Matthias, who suffered from gout, could not walk and was carried in a litter after March 1489. Hereafter, his succession caused bitter conflicts between Queen Beatrice and John Corvinus. Matthias asked Beatrice&#x27;s brother Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, to persuade her not to strive for the Crown and stated that the &quot;Hungarian people are capable of killing up unto the last man rather than submit to the government of a woman&quot;. To strengthen his illegitimate son&#x27;s position, Matthias even proposed withdrawing from Austria and confirming Emperor Frederick&#x27;s right to succeed him if the Emperor was willing to grant Croatia and Bosnia to John Corvinus with the title of king.

Matthias participated in the lengthy Palm Sunday ceremony in Vienna in 1490 although he had felt so ill that morning that he could not eat breakfast. Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint. The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does not exclude the possibility of poisoning. Matthias&#x27;s funeral was held in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna and he was buried in Székesfehérvár Cathedral on 24 or 25 April 1490.

==Patronage==
===Renaissance king===

Matthias was the first non-Italian monarch promoting the spread of Renaissance style in his realm. His marriage to Beatrice of Naples strengthened the influence of contemporaneous Italian art and scholarship, and it was under his reign that Hungary became the first land outside Italy to embrace the Renaissance. The earliest appearance of Renaissance style buildings and works outside Italy were in Hungary. The Italian scholar Marsilio Ficino introduced Matthias to Plato&#x27;s ideas of a philosopher-king uniting wisdom and strength in himself, which fascinated Matthias. Matthias is the main character in Aurelio Lippo Brandolini&#x27;s &quot;Republics and Kingdoms Compared&quot;, a dialogue on the comparison of the two forms of government. According to Brandolini, Matthias said a monarch &quot;is at the head of the law and rules over it&quot; when summing up his own concepts of state.

Matthias also cultivated traditional art. Hungarian epic poems and lyric songs were often sung at his court. He was proud of his role as the defender of Roman Catholicism against the Ottomans and the Hussites. He initiated theological debates, for instance on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, and surpassed both the Pope and his legate &quot;with regard to religious observance&quot;, according to the latter. Matthias issued coins in the 1460s bearing an image of the Virgin Mary, demonstrating his special devotion to her cult.

Upon Matthias&#x27;s initiative, Archbishop John Vitéz and Bishop Janus Pannonius persuaded Pope Paul II to authorize them to set up a university in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 29 May 1465. The &quot;Academia Istropolitana&quot; was closed shortly after the Archbishop&#x27;s death. Matthias was contemplating establishing a new university in Buda but this plan was not accomplished.

===Building projects and arts===
Matthias started at least two major building projects. The works in Buda and Visegrád began in about 1479. Two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Matthias appointed the Italian Chimenti Camicia and the Dalmatian Giovanni Dalmata to direct these projects.

Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor Benedetto da Majano and the painters Filippino Lippi and Andrea Mantegna worked for him. A copy of Mantegna&#x27;s portrait of Matthias survived. In the spring of 1485, Matthias decided to commission Leonardo da Vinci to paint a Madonna to him. Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer Aristotele Fioravanti to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier. He had new monasteries built in Late Gothic style for the Franciscans in Kolozsvár, Szeged and Hunyad, and for the Paulines in Fejéregyháza.

The court of Matthias had a musical establishment of high quality. The master of the Papal Chapel Bartolomeo Maraschi described Matthias&#x27;s chapel choir as the best he had ever heard. Composers such as Josquin Dor and Johannes de Stokem spent time in Matthias&#x27;s court, and numerous Italian musicians visited it. A late remark by , Archbishop of Esztergom, implies that the influential composer Josquin des Prez was active in Matthias&#x27; court for years in the 1480s, but Várdai may have mistaken him for someone else, and there no documentary evidence that places him there.

===Royal library===

Matthias started the systematic collection of books after the arrival of his first librarian, Martius Galeotti, a friend of Janus Pannonius from Ferrara in around 1465. The exchange of letters between Taddeo Ugoleto, who succeeded Marzio in 1471, and Francesco Bandini contributed to the development of the royal library because the latter regularly informed his friend of new manuscripts. Matthias also employed scriptors, illuminators, and book-binders. Although the exact number of his books is unknown, his &quot;Bibliotheca Corviniana&quot; was one of Europe&#x27;s largest collections of books when he died.

According to Marcus Tanner, the surviving 216 volumes of the King&#x27;s library &quot;show that Matthias had the literary tastes of a classic &#x27;alpha male, who preferred secular books to devotional works. For instance, a Latin translation of Xenophon&#x27;s biography of Cyrus the Great, Quintus Curtius Rufus&#x27;s book of Alexander the Great, and a military treatise by the contemporaneous Roberto Valturio survived. Matthias enjoyed reading, as demonstrated by a letter in which he thanked the Italian scholar Pomponio Leto who had sent him Silius Italicus&#x27;s work of the Second Punic War.

===Patron of scholars===
Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them. The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars, mostly Italians, to settle in Buda. Antonio Bonfini, Pietro Ranzano, Bartolomeo Fonzio, and Francesco Bandini spent many years in Matthias&#x27;s court. This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of Neoplatonism to Hungary.

Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals&#x27; life and on the history of nations. Martius Galeotti described him as &quot;king and astrologer&quot;, and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias &quot;never did anything without consulting the stars&quot;. Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes. Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias. The King appointed Bylica as his advisor in 1468. According to Scott E. Hendrix, &quot;establishing a prominent astrologer as his political advisor provided an anxiety-reduction mechanism that boosted morale for the political elites within his realm while strengthening his sense of control in the face of the multiple adversities the Hungarians faced&quot; in his reign.

==Family==

When Matthias was 12, his family arranged for him to marry Elizabeth of Celje who was also a child when their marriage took place in 1455. She died in September before the marriage was consummated. His second wife Catherine of Poděbrady was born in 1449. She died in childbirth in January or February 1464. The child did not survive.

Matthias approached Emperor Frederick to suggest a new bride for him among Frederick&#x27;s relatives. Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg proposed one of his daughters to Matthias but the Hungarian Estates opposed this plan. In an attempt to enter into an alliance with King Casimir IV of Poland, Matthias proposed to the King&#x27;s daughter Hedvig but he was refused. During the 1470 meeting of Emperor Frederick and Matthias, a marriage between Matthias and the Emperor&#x27;s five-year-old daughter Kunigunde of Austria was also discussed, but the Emperor was not willing to commit himself to the marriage.

Matthias&#x27;s third wife Beatrice of Naples was born in 1457. Their engagement was announced in Breslau on 30 October 1474, during the siege of the town by Casimir IV and Vladislaus Jagiellon. Her dowry amounted to 200,000 gold pieces. Beatrice survived her husband and returned to Naples where she died in 1508.

Matthias&#x27;s only known child John Corvinus was born out of wedlock in 1473. His mother Barbara Edelpöck, the daughter of a citizen of Stein in Lower Austria, met the King in early 1470. John Corvinus died on 12 October 1504.

==Legacy==
According to Marcus Tanner, Matthias ruled &quot;a European superpower&quot; at the end of his reign. His conquests, however, were lost within months of his death. The burghers of Breslau soon murdered his captain, Heinz Dompnig. The Emperor&#x27;s rule in Vienna and Wiener Neustadt was restored without resistance.

Stephen Zápolya said the King&#x27;s death relieved &quot;Hungary of the trouble and oppression from which it had suffered so far&quot;. Royal authority quickly diminished because various claimants (John Corvinus; Maximilian of the Romans; Vladislaus Jagiellon; and Vladislaus&#x27;s younger brother, John Albert), who were fighting for the crown. Vladislaus Jagiellon triumphed because the barons regarded him as a weak ruler and he gained the support of Matthias&#x27;s wealthy widow by promising to marry her. Vladislaus was elected king after he promised he would abolish all &quot;harmful innovations&quot; introduced by Matthias, especially the extraordinary tax. Vladislaus could not finance the maintenance of the Black Army and the unpaid mercenaries began plundering the countryside. A royal force led by Paul Kinizsi eliminated them on the river Száva in 1492.

The burden of Matthias&#x27;s wars and splendid royal court mainly fell on the peasants, who paid at least 85% of the taxes. The &quot;Chronicle of Dubnic&quot;, written in eastern Hungary in 1479, says &quot;widows and orphans&quot; cursed the King for the high taxes. However, stories about &quot;Matthias the Just&quot;, who wandered in disguise throughout his realm to deliver justice to his subjects, seem to have spread during Matthias&#x27;s reign. The saying &quot;Dead is Matthias, lost is justice&quot; became popular soon after his death, reflecting that commoners were more likely to have received a fair trial in Matthias&#x27;s reign than under his successors. Matthias is also the subject of popular folk tales in Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, and Slovenia. For instance, King Matjaž is one of the sleeping kings of Slovenian folklore.

==Origin of the nickname Corvinus==
As a king, Matthias had the nickname &quot;Corvinus&quot;, which comes from &quot;Corvus&quot;, Latin for raven. The image of raven appeared on his coat of arms.

<text>Gainesville Regional Airport is a public airport three miles northeast of Gainesville, in Alachua County, Florida, United States. It is owned by Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Airport Authority. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).

Gainesville Regional Airport had 177,282 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2011 and 159,499 enplanements in 2010. They also had 217,355 passenger boardings (enplanements) in 2015, more than 2% higher than 2014.

Gainesville Regional Airport had 558,246 passengers in 2019.

The airport annually hosts the Gator Fly In at the general aviation facilities. The event includes military aircraft displays, a classic car show, food trucks, live music, and aircraft rides aboard a Ford Trimotor, a Cessna 172, and on helicopters.

==History==

Construction of the airport began in April 1940 as a Works Project Administration project. In 1941 initial construction was completed. Upon conclusion of the construction by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the facility was known as the Alachua Army Airfield and was used by the Army Air Corps and the Army Air Forces.

The airfield was declared surplus in September 1945 and turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers on October 1, 1946. The War Assets Administration deeded the facility to the city of Gainesville in 1948 as a civil airport. The field was known as John R. Alison Airport or Gainesville Municipal Airport; the city operated, maintained, and improved the airport, which was renamed the Gainesville Regional Airport in October 1977. The airline terminal was dedicated to John R. Alison in 1979.

Eastern Airlines served Gainesville beginning in the 1950s, with flights to Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Ocala, eventually offering nonstop flights to Atlanta and Miami by the 1970s. Eastern served Gainesville until its bankruptcy in 1991 and was consistently a profitable destination for the company. Air Florida served Gainesville in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with flights to Miami, Tampa and Ocala.

In 1986 the State Legislature passed a bill that established the Airport as the Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Airport Authority. The Airport Authority has nine board members, five selected by the City of Gainesville, three by the Governor and one by Alachua County, and continues to oversee the Airport.

On October 31, 2004 Gainesville Regional Airport hosted Air Force One during George W. Bush&#x27;s re-election campaign. 17,000 people attended the event. They hosted Air Force Two in 2023 after Hurricane Idalia

In recent years the Airport has substantially completed several projects: the refurbishment of its primary runway (11/29), piping of an open ditch parallel to that runway, and completion of two phases of the Terminal Renovation project. Three passenger boarding bridges have been installed.

Eclipse Aviation, maker of the Eclipse 500, operated its first factory service center in Gainesville until the company declared bankruptcy in 2009. In 2012 Silver Airways moved its maintenance facilities from Ft. Lauderdale into the existing Eclipse Aviation facility. Silver provides commercial airline service to several destinations around Florida and Bahamas. In April 2015, Silver Airways moved its maintenance to Orlando International. However, in 2023, Silver Airways announced they would return to Gainesville with service to Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport. But after about 1 year of service to Gainesville Silver Airways announced in August 2024 that they would shut down their service due to low demand and a 28% on-time rate 

The control tower operates from 6:45a to 10:30p daily. After the death of Gainesville native Tom Petty on October 2, 2017, a change.org petition was started to have the airport renamed &quot;Tom Petty - Gainesville Regional Airport&quot;.

In 2021 Gainesville Regional Airport added a 15,200 square-foot expansion onto their terminal. The new expansion adds a mother lactation room, a pet relief area, two new gates, hundreds of new seats with charging ports, a departure and arrival board, and an area for a food/store vendor. In addition to the expansion, the existing terminal was given a renovation. The project cost $16 million dollars that was funded by a $12 million dollar grant from the FAA.
In February 2024, the airport broke ground on a new four story 418-space parking garage to alleviate parking concerns. The garage will also house new ride-sharing pickup points and bus service, and is expected to open by late 2025. 

==Facilities==
The airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 11/29 is 7,504 by 150 feet (2,287 x 46 m) and 07/25 is 4,158 by 100 feet (1,267 x 30 m).

In the year ending September 30, 2022 the airport had 68,032 aircraft operations, average 186 per day: 78% general aviation, 6% air taxi, 7% military and 9% airline. 173 aircraft at that time were based at the airport: 98 single-engine, 18 multi-engine, 51 jet and 6 helicopter.

Gainesville Regional Airport has one full service FBO, University Air Center. There were two, Gulf Atlantic Airways and Flight Line. Flight Line&#x27;s contract with the airport authority expired and Gulf Atlantic became University Air Center. University Air Center has a pilots lounge with TV, snack machines, aircraft rentals and charters, flight instruction, and fuel.
Gainesville Regional Airport&#x27;s terminal has 5 gates. Gates 3, 4, and 5 are used by American Eagle. Gates 1 and 2 are used by Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection. The airport terminal has a snack bar and a gift shop, operated by Tailwind. The airport&#x27;s ground transportation is served by taxis; rental car companies; an RTS bus stop serving routes 25, 26, and 39; and hotel shuttle buses. Renovations that were completed in 2021 added 2 additional gates to the facility, in addition to a larger baggage screening area, and additional parking spaces. The terminal expansion and improvement project was completed July 29, 2021, and also added additional restrooms, additional food and beverage areas, a lactation room, an airport chapel, and a pet relief area, in addition to 2 additional gates

In August 2021, the Gainesville City Commission approved FAA grants to cover engineering costs for improvements to the apron and taxiway and costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Survey methodology is &quot;the study of survey methods&quot;.
As a field of applied statistics concentrating on human-research surveys, survey methodology studies the sampling of individual units from a population and associated techniques of survey data collection, such as questionnaire construction and methods for improving the number and accuracy of responses to surveys. Survey methodology targets instruments or procedures that ask one or more questions that may or may not be answered.

Researchers carry out statistical surveys with a view towards making statistical inferences about the population being studied; such inferences depend strongly on the survey questions used. Polls about public opinion, public-health surveys, market-research surveys, government surveys and censuses all exemplify quantitative research that uses survey methodology to answer questions about a population. Although censuses do not include a &quot;sample&quot;, they do include other aspects of survey methodology, like questionnaires, interviewers, and non-response follow-up techniques. Surveys provide important information for all kinds of public-information and research fields, such as marketing research, psychology, health-care provision and sociology.

==Overview==
A single survey is made of at least a sample (or full population in the case of a census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should abortion be legal?), behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system (see also sampling (statistics) and survey sampling). The persons replying to a survey are called respondents, and depending on the questions asked their answers may represent themselves as individuals, their households, employers, or other organization they represent.

Survey methodology as a scientific field seeks to identify principles about the sample design, data collection instruments, statistical adjustment of data, and data processing, and final data analysis that can create systematic and random survey errors. Survey errors are sometimes analyzed in connection with survey cost. Cost constraints are sometimes framed as improving quality within cost constraints, or alternatively, reducing costs for a fixed level of quality. Survey methodology is both a scientific field and a profession, meaning that some professionals in the field focus on survey errors empirically and others design surveys to reduce them. For survey designers, the task involves making a large set of decisions about thousands of individual features of a survey in order to improve it.

The most important methodological challenges of a survey methodologist include making decisions on how to:
* Identify and select potential sample members.
* Contact sampled individuals and collect data from those who are hard to reach (or reluctant to respond)
* Evaluate and test questions.
* Select the mode for posing questions and collecting responses.
* Train and supervise interviewers (if they are involved).
* Check data files for accuracy and internal consistency.
* Adjust survey estimates to correct for identified errors.
* Complement survey data with new data sources (if appropriate)

==Selecting samples==

The sample is chosen from the sampling frame, which consists of a list of all members of the population of interest. The goal of a survey is not to describe the sample, but the larger population. This generalizing ability is dependent on the representativeness of the sample, as stated above. Each member of the population is termed an element. There are frequent difficulties one encounters while choosing a representative sample. One common error that results is selection bias. Selection bias results when the procedures used to select a sample result in over representation or under representation of some significant aspect of the population. For instance, if the population of interest consists of 75% females, and 25% males, and the sample consists of 40% females and 60% males, females are under represented while males are overrepresented. In order to minimize selection biases, stratified random sampling is often used. This is when the population is divided into sub-populations called strata, and random samples are drawn from each of the strata, or elements are drawn for the sample on a proportional basis.

==Modes of data collection==

There are several ways of administering a survey. The choice between administration modes is influenced by several factors, including
# costs,
# coverage of the target population,
# flexibility of asking questions,
# respondents&#x27; willingness to participate and
# response accuracy.
Different methods create mode effects that change how respondents answer, and different methods have different advantages. The most common modes of administration can be summarized as:

*Telephone
*Mail (post)
*Online surveys
*Mobile surveys
*Personal in-home surveys
*Personal mall or street intercept survey
*Mixed modes

==Research designs==
There are several different designs, or overall structures, that can be used in survey research. The three general types are cross-sectional, successive independent samples, and longitudinal studies.

===Cross-sectional studies===
In cross-sectional studies, a sample (or samples) is drawn from the relevant population and studied once. A cross-sectional study describes characteristics of that population at one time, but cannot give any insight as to the causes of population characteristics because it is a predictive, correlational design.

===Successive independent samples studies===
A successive independent samples design draws multiple random samples from a population at one or more times. This design can study changes within a population, but not changes within individuals because the same individuals are not surveyed more than once. Such studies cannot, therefore, identify the causes of change over time necessarily. For successive independent samples designs to be effective, the samples must be drawn from the same population, and must be equally representative of it. If the samples are not comparable, the changes between samples may be due to demographic characteristics rather than time. In addition, the questions must be asked in the same way so that responses can be compared directly.

===Longitudinal studies===
Longitudinal studies take measure of the same random sample at multiple time points. Unlike with a successive independent samples design, this design measures the differences in individual participants&#x27; responses over time. This means that a researcher can potentially assess the reasons for response changes by assessing the differences in respondents&#x27; experiences. Longitudinal studies are the easiest way to assess the effect of a naturally occurring event, such as divorce that cannot be tested experimentally.

However, longitudinal studies are both expensive and difficult to do. It is harder to find a sample that will commit to a months- or years-long study than a 15-minute interview, and participants frequently leave the study before the final assessment. In addition, such studies sometimes require data collection to be confidential or anonymous, which creates additional difficulty in linking participants&#x27; responses over time. One potential solution is the use of a self-generated identification code (SGIC). These codes usually are created from elements like &#x27;month of birth&#x27; and &#x27;first letter of the mother&#x27;s middle name.&#x27; Some recent anonymous SGIC approaches have also attempted to minimize use of personalized data even further, instead using questions like &#x27;name of your first pet. Depending on the approach used, the ability to match some portion of the sample can be lost.

In addition, the overall attrition of participants is not random, so samples can become less representative with successive assessments. To account for this, a researcher can compare the respondents who left the survey to those that did not, to see if they are statistically different populations. Respondents may also try to be self-consistent in spite of changes to survey answers.

==Questionnaires==

Questionnaires are the most commonly used tool in survey research. However, the results of a particular survey are worthless if the questionnaire is written inadequately. Questionnaires should produce valid and reliable demographic variable measures and should yield valid and reliable individual disparities that self-report scales generate.

===Questionnaires as tools===
A variable category that is often measured in survey research are demographic variables, which are used to depict the characteristics of the people surveyed in the sample. Demographic variables include such measures as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, race, and age. Surveys often assess the preferences and attitudes of individuals, and many employ self-report scales to measure people&#x27;s opinions and judgements about different items presented on a scale. Self-report scales are also used to examine the disparities among people on scale items. These self-report scales, which are usually presented in questionnaire form, are one of the most used instruments in psychology, and thus it is important that the measures be constructed carefully, while also being reliable and valid.

===Reliability and validity of self-report measures===
Reliable measures of self-report are defined by their consistency. Thus, a reliable self-report measure produces consistent results every time it is executed. A test&#x27;s reliability can be measured a few ways. First, one can calculate a test-retest reliability. A test-retest reliability entails conducting the same questionnaire to a large sample at two different times. For the questionnaire to be considered reliable, people in the sample do not have to score identically on each test, but rather their position in the score distribution should be similar for both the test and the retest. Self-report measures will generally be more reliable when they have many items measuring a construct. Furthermore, measurements will be more reliable when the factor being measured has greater variability among the individuals in the sample that are being tested. Finally, there will be greater reliability when instructions for the completion of the questionnaire are clear and when there are limited distractions in the testing environment. Contrastingly, a questionnaire is valid if what it measures is what it had originally planned to measure. Construct validity of a measure is the degree to which it measures the theoretical construct that it was originally supposed to measure.

===Composing a questionnaire===

Six steps can be employed to construct a questionnaire that will produce reliable and valid results. First, one must decide what kind of information should be collected. Second, one must decide how to conduct the questionnaire. Thirdly, one must construct a first draft of the questionnaire. Fourth, the questionnaire should be revised. Next, the questionnaire should be pretested. Finally, the questionnaire should be edited and the procedures for its use should be specified.

===Guidelines for the effective wording of questions===
The way that a question is phrased can have a large impact on how a research participant will answer the question. Thus, survey researchers must be conscious of their wording when writing survey questions. It is important for researchers to keep in mind that different individuals, cultures, and subcultures can interpret certain words and phrases differently from one another. There are two different types of questions that survey researchers use when writing a questionnaire: free response questions and closed questions. Free response questions are open-ended, whereas closed questions are usually multiple choice. Free response questions are beneficial because they allow the responder greater flexibility, but they are also very difficult to record and score, requiring extensive coding. Contrastingly, closed questions can be scored and coded more easily, but they diminish expressivity and spontaneity of the responder. In general, the vocabulary of the questions should be very simple and direct, and most should be less than twenty words. Each question should be edited for &quot;readability&quot; and should avoid leading or loaded questions. Finally, if multiple items are being used to measure one construct, the wording of some of the items should be worded in the opposite direction to evade response bias.

A respondent&#x27;s answer to an open-ended question can be coded into a response scale afterwards, or analysed using more qualitative methods.

===Order of questions===
Survey researchers should carefully construct the order of questions in a questionnaire. For questionnaires that are self-administered, the most interesting questions should be at the beginning of the questionnaire to catch the respondent&#x27;s attention, while demographic questions should be near the end. Contrastingly, if a survey is being administered over the telephone or in person, demographic questions should be administered at the beginning of the interview to boost the respondent&#x27;s confidence. Another reason to be mindful of question order may cause a survey response effect in which one question may affect how people respond to subsequent questions as a result of priming.

===Translating a questionnaire===
Translation is crucial to collecting comparable survey data. Questionnaires are translated from a source language into one or more target languages, such as translating from English into Spanish and German. A team approach is recommended in the translation process to include translators, subject-matter experts and persons helpful to the process.

Survey translation best practice includes parallel translation, team discussions, and pretesting with real-life people. It is not a mechanical word placement process. The model TRAPD - Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretest, and Documentation - originally developed for the European Social Surveys, is now &quot;widely used in the global survey research community, although not always labeled as such or implemented in its complete form&quot;. For example, sociolinguistics provides a theoretical framework for questionnaire translation and complements TRAPD. This approach states that for the questionnaire translation to achieve the equivalent communicative effect as the source language, the translation must be linguistically appropriate while incorporating the social practices and cultural norms of the target language.

==Nonresponse reduction==
The following ways have been recommended for reducing nonresponse in telephone and face-to-face surveys:
* Advance letter. A short letter is sent in advance to inform the sampled respondents about the upcoming survey. The style of the letter should be personalized but not overdone. First, it announces that a phone call will be made, or an interviewer wants to make an appointment to do the survey face-to-face. Second, the research topic will be described. Last, it allows both an expression of the surveyor&#x27;s appreciation of cooperation and an opening to ask questions on the survey.
* Training. The interviewers are thoroughly trained in how to ask respondents questions, how to work with computers and making schedules for callbacks to respondents who were not reached.
* Short introduction. The interviewer should always start with a short introduction about him or herself. She/he should give her name, the institute she is working for, the length of the interview and goal of the interview. Also it can be useful to make clear that you are not selling anything: this has been shown to lead to a slightly higher responding rate.
* Respondent-friendly survey questionnaire. The questions asked must be clear, non-offensive and easy to respond to for the subjects under study.

Brevity is also often cited as increasing response rate. A 1996 literature review found mixed evidence to support this claim for both written and verbal surveys, concluding that other factors may often be more important.
A 2010 study looking at 100,000 online surveys found response rate dropped by about 3% at 10 questions and about 6% at 20 questions, with drop-off slowing (for example, only 10% reduction at 40 questions).
Other studies showed that quality of response degraded toward the end of long surveys.

Some researchers have also discussed the recipient&#x27;s role or profession as a potential factor affecting how nonresponse is managed. For example, faxes are not commonly used to distribute surveys, but in a recent study were sometimes preferred by pharmacists, since they frequently receive faxed prescriptions at work but may not always have access to a generally-addressed piece of mail.

==Interviewer effects==
Survey methodologists have devoted much effort to determining the extent to which interviewee responses are affected by physical characteristics of the interviewer. Main interviewer traits that have been demonstrated to influence survey responses are race, gender,
and relative body weight (BMI).
These interviewer effects are particularly operant when questions are related to the interviewer trait. Hence, race of interviewer has been shown to affect responses to measures regarding racial attitudes,
interviewer sex responses to questions involving gender issues,
and interviewer BMI answers to eating and dieting-related questions.
While interviewer effects have been investigated mainly for face-to-face surveys, they have also been shown to exist for interview modes with no visual contact, such as telephone surveys and in video-enhanced web surveys. The explanation typically provided for interviewer effects is social desirability bias: survey participants may attempt to project a positive self-image in an effort to conform to the norms they attribute to the interviewer asking questions. Interviewer effects are one example survey response effects.

==The role of big data==
Since 2018, survey methodologists have started to examine how big data can complement survey methodology to allow researchers and practitioners to improve the production of survey statistics and its quality. Big data has low cost per data point, applies analysis techniques via machine learning and data mining, and includes diverse and new data sources, e.g., registers, social media, apps, and other forms of digital data. There have been three Big Data Meets Survey Science (BigSurv) conferences in 2018, 2020, 2023, and a conference forthcoming in 2025, a special issue in the &quot;Social Science Computer Review&quot;, a special issue in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Statistical Society&quot;, and a special issue in &quot;EP J Data Science&quot;, and a book called &quot;Big Data Meets Social Sciences&quot; edited by Craig A. Hill and five other Fellows of the American Statistical Association.

<doc id="272141" wikidata="Q586358" url="?curid=272141" title="Subcarrier">
<text>A subcarrier is a sideband of a radio frequency carrier wave, which is modulated to send additional information. Examples include the provision of colour in a black and white television system or the provision of stereo in a monophonic radio broadcast. There is no physical difference between a carrier and a subcarrier; the &quot;sub&quot; implies that it has been derived from a carrier, which has been amplitude modulated by a steady signal and has a constant frequency relation to it.

==FM stereo==
Stereo broadcasting is made possible by using a subcarrier on FM radio stations, which takes the left channel and &quot;subtracts&quot; the right channel from it — essentially by hooking up the right-channel wires backward (reversing polarity) and then joining left and reversed-right. The result is modulated with suppressed carrier AM, more correctly called sum and difference modulation or SDM, at 38 kHz in the FM signal, which is joined at 2% modulation with the mono left+right audio (which ranges 50 Hz ~ 15 kHz). A 19 kHz pilot tone is also added at a 9% modulation to trigger radios to decode the stereo subcarrier, making FM stereo fully compatible with mono. 

Once the receiver demodulates the L+R and L−R signals, it adds the two signals ([L+R] + [L−R] = 2L) to get the left channel and subtracts ([L+R] − [L−R] = 2R) to get the right channel. Rather than having a local oscillator, the 19 kHz pilot tone provides an in-phase reference signal used to reconstruct the missing carrier wave from the 38 kHz signal.

For AM broadcasting, different analog (AM stereo) and digital (HD Radio) methods are used to produce stereophonic audio. Modulated subcarriers of the type used in FM broadcasting are impractical for AM broadcast due to the relatively narrow signal bandwidth allocated for a given AM signal. On standard AM broadcast radios, the entire 9 kHz to 10 kHz allocated bandwidth of the AM signal may be used for audio.

==Television==
Likewise, analog TV signals are transmitted with the black and white luminance part as the main signal, and the color chrominance as the subcarriers. A black and white TV simply ignores the extra information, as it has no decoder for it. To reduce the bandwidth of the color subcarriers, they are filtered to remove higher frequencies. This is made possible by the fact that the human eye sees much more detail in contrast than in color. In addition, only blue and red are transmitted, with green being determined by subtracting the other two from the luminance and taking the remainder. (See: YIQ, YCbCr, YPbPr) Various broadcast television systems use different subcarrier frequencies, in addition to differences in encoding.

For the audio part, MTS uses subcarriers on the video that can also carry three audio channels, including one for stereo (same left-minus-right method as for FM), another for second audio programs (such as descriptive video service for the vision-impaired, and bilingual programs), and yet a third hidden one for the studio to communicate with reporters or technicians in the field (or for a technician or broadcast engineer at a remote transmitter site to talk back to the studio), or any other use a TV station might see fit. (See also NICAM, A2 Stereo.)

In RF-transmitted composite video, subcarriers remain in the baseband signal after main carrier demodulation to be separated in the receiver. The mono audio component of the transmitted signal is in a separate carrier and not integral to the video component. In wired video connections, composite video retains the integrated subcarrier signal structure found in the transmitted baseband signal, while S-Video places the chrominance and luminance signals on separate wires to eliminate subcarrier crosstalk and enhance the signal bandwidth and strength (picture sharpness and brightness).

==Private audio==
Before satellite, Muzak and similar services were transmitted to department stores on FM subcarriers. The fidelity of the subcarrier audio was limited compared to the primary FM radio audio channel. The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also allowed betting parlors in New York state to get horse racing results from the state gaming commission via the same technology.

Many non-commercial educational FM stations in the US (especially public radio stations affiliated with NPR) broadcast a radio reading service for the blind, which reads articles in local newspapers and sometimes magazines. The vision-impaired can request a special radio, permanently tuned to receive audio on a particular subcarrier frequency (usually 67 kHz or 92 kHz), from a particular FM station. 

Services like these and others on broadcast FM subcarriers are referred to as a Subsidiary Communications Authority (SCA) service by the FCC in the United States, and as Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operations (SCMO) by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in Canada.

==Datacasting==

The RDS/RBDS subcarrier (57 kHz) allows FM radios to display what station they are on, pick another frequency on the same network or with the same format, scroll brief messages like station slogans, news, weather, or traffic—even activate pagers or remote billboards. It can also broadcast EAS messages, and has a station &quot;format&quot; name ALERT to automatically trigger radios to tune in for emergency info, even if a CD is playing. While it never really caught on in North America, European stations frequently rely on this system. An upgraded version is built into digital radio.

xRDS is a system with which broadcasters can multiply the speed of data transmission in the FM channel by using further normal RDS subcarriers, shifted into the higher frequencies of the FM multiplex. The extra RDS subcarriers are placed in the upper empty part of the multiplex spectrum and carry the extra data payload. xRDS has no fixed frequencies for the additional 57 kHz carriers.

Until 2012, MSN Direct used subcarriers to transmit traffic, gas prices, movie times, weather and other information to GPS navigation devices, wristwatches, and other devices. Many of the subcarriers were from stations owned by Clear Channel. The technology was known as DirectBand.

FMeXtra on FM uses dozens of small COFDM subcarriers to transmit digital radio in a fully in-band on-channel manner. Removing other analog subcarriers (such as stereo) increases either the audio quality or channels available, the latter making it possible to send non-audio metadata along with it, such as album covers, song lyrics, artist info, concert data, and more.

==Telemetry and foldback==
Many stations use subcarriers for internal purposes, such as getting telemetry back from a remote transmitter, often located in a difficult-to-access area at the top of a mountain. A station&#x27;s engineer can carry a decoder around with them and know anything that is wrong, as long as the station is on the air and they are within range. This is the essence of a wireless transmitter/studio link.

On wireless studio/transmitter links (STLs), not only are the broadcast station&#x27;s subcarriers transmitted, but other remote control commands as well.

Interruptible foldback, such as for remote broadcasting, is also possible over subcarriers, though its role is limited.

==MCPC satellites==
Analog satellite television and terrestrial analog microwave relay communications rely on subcarriers transmitted with the video carrier on a satellite transponder or microwave channel for the audio channels of a video feed. There are usually at frequencies of 5.8, 6.2, or 6.8 MHz (the video carrier usually resides below 5 MHz on a satellite transponder or microwave relay). Extra subcarriers are sometimes transmitted at around 7 or 8 MHz for extra audio (such as radio stations) or low-to-medium-speed data. This is referred to as multiple channel per carrier (MCPC).

This is now mostly superseded by digital TV (usually DVB-S, DVB-S2 or another MPEG-2-based system), where audio and video data are packaged together (multiplexed) in a single MPEG transport stream.

<text>Robert Budd Dwyer (November 21, 1939 – January 22, 1987) was an American politician. He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate representing the state&#x27;s 50th district. Dwyer then served as the 70th state treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until January 22, 1987, when he committed suicide during a press conference.

During the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered that its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding before Dwyer&#x27;s administration. A multimillion-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted of accepting a bribe from Computer Technology Associates, a California-based company, to award them the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury, and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987. On January 22, Dwyer arranged a news conference in the Pennsylvania State Capitol Building in Harrisburg, during which he fatally shot himself with a .357 Magnum revolver in the presence of reporters. Dwyer&#x27;s suicide was live broadcast to many television viewers in Pennsylvania.

All posthumous appeals made by Dwyer&#x27;s lawyers on Dwyer&#x27;s behalf were denied, and his convictions were sustained. Along with Barbara Hafer and Rob McCord, Dwyer is one of three former Pennsylvania State treasurers to be convicted of corruption since the 1980s.

==Early life and education==
Robert Budd Dwyer was born on November 21, 1939, in St. Charles, Missouri. He graduated in 1961 with an A.B. in Political Science and Accounting from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Beta Chi chapter of Theta Chi fraternity. After earning a master&#x27;s degree in education in 1963, he taught social studies and coached football at Cambridge Springs High School.

==Career==
===Pennsylvania Assembly===

A Republican, Dwyer became active in politics. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 6th district (although seats were apportioned by county before 1969) in 1964 and was reelected in 1966 and 1968. In 1970, while still a State Representative, Dwyer campaigned to become a Pennsylvania State Senator for the Senate&#x27;s 50th district, and won. Soon after his victory he resigned as Representative and was sworn in as Senator in January 1971.

===Pennsylvania Treasurer===
After being elected two additional terms in 1974 and 1978, Dwyer decided to try for a statewide office and in 1980 campaigned for and won the office of Pennsylvania Treasurer that had been held by Robert E. Casey (not to be confused with Governor of Pennsylvania Robert P. Casey) since 1976. He campaigned for a second and last term in 1984 and won reelection, defeating Democratic nominee and former auditor general Al Benedict.

Dwyer maintained that his Treasury administration &quot;…transformed the Department from a financial antique into one of the most modern in the nation, earning and saving hundreds of millions of dollars each year...&quot;

====Bribery investigation and conviction====
From 1979 to 1981, before Dwyer was state treasurer, public employees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania overpaid millions of dollars in Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes (FICA). As a result, the state required an accounting company to determine refunds for its employees. Dwyer awarded the no-bid $4.6 million contract to Computer Technology Associates (CTA), a California-based company, owned by John Torquato Jr., a native of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on May 10, 1984.

During early 1984, Dennis Schatzman, deputy comptroller of Pittsburgh Public Schools, noticed financial discrepancies in the CTA contract, and wrote to Pittsburgh school officials regarding these. Schatzman later contacted officials of the accounting company Arthur Young and Associates, who confirmed that the no-bid CTA contract was overpriced by millions of dollars. In June 1984 the Office of the Pennsylvania Auditor General informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the alleged bribery that occurred during the awarding of the contract. During late July 1984, Janice R. Kincaid, a former CTA employee, released a sworn statement claiming that Dwyer awarded the contract to CTA because he was promised a $300,000 kickback by the company. Kincaid also indicated that Torquato directed women who worked for CTA to give sexual favors to potential clients.

Dwyer&#x27;s awarding of the CTA contract was investigated by federal prosecutors. Upon learning of this investigation, Dwyer rescinded the contract with CTA on July 11, 1984. Subsequently, Dwyer repeatedly attempted to stop, divert and forestall the investigation, stating that the U.S. attorney had neither the authority nor evidence to pursue prosecution. Dwyer later admitted to telling his staff to withhold request for proposal (RFP) information from the U.S. attorney and the FBI during the investigation. After being indicted by a federal grand jury, Dwyer was finally charged with agreeing to receive a kickback of $300,000 in return for awarding CTA the contract.

Dwyer stated that he offered to take a polygraph test but only on the condition that if he passed it, he would not be indicted. The state rejected Dwyer&#x27;s offer. Prior to Dwyer&#x27;s indictment, on October 22, 1984, a grand jury indicted Torquato, Torquato&#x27;s attorney William T. Smith, Judy Smith, Alan R. Stoneman, and David Herbert. At Smith&#x27;s 1985 trial, Smith, who was a friend of Dwyer&#x27;s, testified that he did not bribe Dwyer, and instead that Torquato offered Dwyer a campaign contribution in return for the CTA contract, yet Dwyer rejected Torquato&#x27;s offer. In contrast, Torquato testified that Smith offered Dwyer a $300,000 bribe in return for the CTA contract. Dwyer, acting as a defense witness for Smith at Smith&#x27;s trial, denied that he was offered any contribution at all. In August 1984, Smith failed a polygraph test when he stated that he did not bribe Dwyer or any state official. However, prior to Smith&#x27;s trial, on October 27, 1984 (four days after Smith&#x27;s indictment), Smith confessed to offering Dwyer a bribe, and stated that Dwyer accepted this offer.

However, Robert B. Asher, the then Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman, objected to this, and requested that the $300,000 be directed entirely to the Republican State Committee, since Asher &quot;did not want Dwyer to go to jail&quot;.

Dwyer, along with Asher, were indicted by a federal grand jury on May 13, 1986. In the hopes of reducing his twelve-year sentence resulting from his 1985 conviction, Smith testified on behalf of the federal government against Dwyer and Asher at their 1986 trial. Ultimately, Smith did not receive any reduction of his sentence for testifying against Dwyer (although his wife, Judy Smith, was granted immunity from prosecution). Before testifying against Dwyer, Smith passed a polygraph test.

It was revealed at Dwyer&#x27;s trial that he sought and won approval for special legislation—Act 38 of 1984 (House Bill 1397)—that authorized him to recover the FICA overpayments, and that coded computer tape seized from CTA&#x27;s office on July 6, 1984, showed that Dwyer was to receive a $300,000 pay-off for awarding CTA the contract. Moreover, Smith and Torquato&#x27;s claims about Dwyer being bribed were corroborated by four independent and impartial witnesses, and Smith&#x27;s testimony against Dwyer was virtually identical to written statements Smith made long before entering into a plea agreement. Additionally, FBI agents testified that Dwyer attempted to conceal his involvement with the scheme when, after learning of the FBI investigation, he erased the entry in his appointment book of the March 2, 1984, meeting with Torquato and Smith in which he was first offered a bribe. 

Dwyer maintained that he awarded CTA the contract on the basis of his treasury task force recommendation, yet this conflicted with the fact that Dwyer personally managed all matters relating to the contract six days prior to awarding it to CTA. Furthermore, his task force&#x27;s contribution merely consisted in the making of a single telephone call to David I. Herbert (the former State Director for Social Security, who controlled FICA recovery for Pennsylvania&#x27;s public employees, and who was convicted subsequently for conspiring with CTA).

Dwyer awarded the contract to CTA—an obscure California-based company with three employees, little equipment, and little experience—despite being informed in April 1984 by the major Pennsylvania-based accounting company Arthur Young and Associates, which had 250 employees and submitted a proposal on April 13, 1984, at least fourteen days prior to CTA&#x27;s proposal, that they could perform the FICA recovery as fast as CTA for half the cost.

====Trial====
Charles Collins, Arthur Young&#x27;s former management consulting director in Pittsburgh, testified at Dwyer&#x27;s trial that Arthur Young and Associates, who, unlike CTA, had experience in identical tax recovery work, was prepared to negotiate the FICA recovery contract (that was half the cost of the CTA contract) and that Dwyer was clearly aware of Arthur Young&#x27;s offer before committing the contract to CTA. Additionally, sixteen other competitors were willing to be considered for the FICA recovery contract and many had communicated with Treasurer Dwyer&#x27;s office to request an opportunity to bid on the contract, yet Dwyer did not respond. Dwyer repeatedly stated that he awarded the contract to CTA as a result of his task force&#x27;s recommendation on the basis of CTA&#x27;s providing &quot;immediate credit&quot;, yet the contract between CTA and Dwyer contained no information regarding CTA&#x27;s ability to provide such credit. Moreover, Dwyer admitted that he did not mention the concept of &quot;immediate credit&quot; to Arthur Young and Associates when officials from the company asked why CTA was chosen instead of them. In contradiction to Dwyer&#x27;s statements about awarding CTA the contract on the basis of their providing &quot;immediate credit&quot;, Arthur Young and Associates were told that CTA got the contract since they first recognized that the overpayments could be recovered, and that they endorsed legislation that gave Dwyer the sole power to award said contract.

Dwyer denied any wrongdoing, stating that after the CTA contract was signed, Smith merely made a &quot;generic&quot; offer to help him with his campaign. Dwyer&#x27;s lawyer spoke to the prosecutor, acting U.S. Attorney James West, asking him if he would dismiss all charges against Dwyer if Dwyer resigned as state treasurer. West refused the offer. He instead offered to let Dwyer plead guilty to a single charge of bribe receiving, which would have meant a maximum of five years&#x27; imprisonment, as long as he resigned from his office as Treasurer of Pennsylvania and cooperated completely with the government&#x27;s investigation, but Dwyer refused and went to trial. At his trial, Dwyer did not testify, and his lawyer, Paul Killion, presented no defense witnesses since he thought that the government did not sufficiently prove its case. It is possible that Dwyer did not testify in his own defense since he did not want to be questioned regarding his involvement in a 1980 conspiracy involving his wife&#x27;s business &quot;Poli-Ed,&quot; and two Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA) employees. One of these employees was Dwyer&#x27;s close friend and campaign manager Fred Mckillop, who was subsequently dismissed by the PSEA for his involvement with the scheme, and who later featured in a 2010 documentary about Dwyer. In this conspiracy, which was investigated by the office of the Pennsylvania Attorney General, Dwyer allegedly siphoned money from his campaign into his personal funds.

On December 18, 1986, Dwyer was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was consequently liable to a sentence of as much as 55 years imprisonment and a $300,000 fine. His sentencing was scheduled for January 23, 1987, to be performed by U.S. District Court Judge Malcolm Muir. One mail-fraud charge against Dwyer was dismissed by Judge Muir. One juror, Carolyn Edwards of Williamsport, found it emotionally difficult to convict Dwyer (and Asher) since they were men of &quot;very high integrity ... they just made a mistake&quot;, while Dwyer made a statement after the verdict saying &quot;This is a sad and shocking day for me, totally unbelievable, I&#x27;m totally innocent of all of these charges and I don&#x27;t know how this could have happened&quot;. Robert B. Asher, Dwyer&#x27;s co-defendant, was sentenced to one year in jail. He later resumed politics and served as a Republican national committeeman for Pennsylvania.

Accounting company Levin-Horwath ultimately fulfilled the contract for $1,300,000, with slightly more than a third of the fee possibly being subject to rebate. If CTA were to have performed the recovery work, Pennsylvania would have lost $6,000,000.

Pennsylvania law stated that Dwyer could not officially be dismissed from office until his sentencing in January. Given this, Dwyer stated that until his legal appeal was resolved, he would continue as treasurer with a leave of absence without pay and would not resign before having the opportunity to appeal his conviction. In the interim, the treasury department would be managed by Deputy Treasurer Donald L. Johnson.

Dwyer continued to profess his innocence after being convicted, and on December 23 wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan seeking a presidential pardon, and to Senator Arlen Specter seeking assistance with this effort.

The week of Dwyer&#x27;s sentencing, Pennsylvania State Attorney General LeRoy Zimmerman and state prosecutors were investigating a provision of the Pennsylvania state constitution such that dismissal of a civil worker from office who has been convicted of a crime is &quot;self-executing&quot;, thus, automatic upon that person&#x27;s sentencing. A decision confirming this constitutional provision was expected on January 22, the day before Dwyer&#x27;s sentencing hearing.

==Public suicide==
In a meeting in his home on January 15, 1987, Dwyer discussed the idea of a press conference with his press secretary James &quot;Duke&quot; Horshock and Deputy Treasurer Don Johnson. At the meeting, both Horshock and Johnson cautioned Dwyer not to use the conference to attack the governor or other individuals involved with his criminal conviction, and both suggested to Dwyer that he should have the conference at a location other than his office. Dwyer angrily rejected their suggestion, but nevertheless assured both men that he would not attack anybody involved with his conviction. He said that he would not announce his resignation at the conference, but rather thank his staff and friends. Both men left assuming Dwyer would ultimately resign at the conference, although Horshock had fears that Dwyer would violate his promise.

The next day, Dwyer and his wife Joanne visited his lawyer, Paul Killion, who told Dwyer to express repentance for his crimes. Dwyer responded by agreeing to change his &quot;version of events&quot;, which was to be presented to Judge Muir at Dwyer&#x27;s pre-sentencing conference scheduled for the afternoon of January 22. During the meeting, Killion became concerned about Dwyer and confided in Joanne, asking if Dwyer was capable of harming himself, which Joanne responded by saying that he &quot;loves life too much&quot;. Dwyer later saw Killion again, gave him an updated &quot;version of events&quot;, and stated that he would announce his resignation at the press conference, yet did not want Killion to attend the conference.

On January 20, Dwyer wrote a letter to then-Senator Joe Biden and Congressman Peter W. Rodino, who were at the time the chairs of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee respectively, asking them to conduct an investigation into the CTA affair, to reform the justice system in the United States, and if this was not done, to completely remove the word &quot;justice&quot; from everything related to the DOJ. The same day, Dwyer was visited by his personal friends, bail bondsman Harvey Childs and his wife Linda, during which Dwyer claimed that he could not have taken a bribe because he could not have accounted for it, and watched the inauguration of Governor Bob Casey on television, lamenting that he should have been Lieutenant Governor for William Scranton III, the Republican candidate who lost the gubernatorial election to Casey.

Dwyer finally reached U.S. Senator Arlen Specter by telephone on January 21, two days before his sentencing. A Specter aide stated that the two of them talked for eight to ten minutes. He then wrote personally to President Ronald Reagan asking for a presidential pardon. In his letter, Dwyer once again professed his innocence and stated that the concept of immediate credit was not understood by the uneducated, unsophisticated &quot;rural&quot; jury at his trial. The senator responded that this request to President Reagan was &quot;not realistic&quot; because the judicial process, including appeals, had not yet finished.

On the same day, Dwyer asked his press secretary Horshock and deputy press secretary Gregory Penny to schedule a news conference for the next day without telling them what he was to discuss. Horshock arranged the press conference for 10:30 a.m. EST the next day, January 22. The press secretary summoned dozens of reporters asking them to attend, and told them he did not know its subject.

Dwyer wanted to ban certain reporters from the press conference who he believed wrote biased accounts about him and even suggested that a guard should be in attendance to prevent entry to those who were not on his authorized list. Horshock, who was unconvinced about Dwyer&#x27;s claims that he was being conspired against, objected, stating to Dwyer that he could not &quot;use state government facilities to manipulate the free flow of information&quot;.

Before the press conference, acting U.S. Attorney West, who had secured the conviction against Dwyer, remarked that a resignation &quot;sounds like the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances. It seems like it would save everybody a lot of time and aggravation.&quot; Similarly, Harrisburg &quot;Patriot-News&quot; reporter Kenn Marshall described the consensus among reporters: they would be attending to see Dwyer announce his resignation from his office. &quot;My mission was to stay there until he said those words, then call in a new top for our story.&quot;

The night before the press conference, Dwyer wrote the following note:

===Press statement===
The next morning, Dwyer went to his press conference as planned. Standing behind a large wood table that separated him from nine television cameras, four wire service photographers and about 20 television, radio and newspaper reporters, he began reading from a 21-page prepared text, while aides handed a 20-page version to the media. The final page was expected to be his announcement that he would resign from office.

Appearing agitated, Dwyer again professed his innocence and accused acting U.S. Attorney James West, FBI agents, U.S. District Court Judge Malcolm Muir, the media and others for abusing the justice system and ruining him. Dwyer stated that Attorney West purposely held Dwyer&#x27;s trial not in Harrisburg but in Williamsport, due to it being located in Lycoming County, one of the most uneducated counties in Pennsylvania. Dwyer spoke out against the death penalty and expressed regret for voting in favor of it while he was in the Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway through it, some of the gathered press began to pack and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, &quot;Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we&#x27;re not, we&#x27;re not finished yet.&quot;

Given the sensitive nature of portions of Dwyer&#x27;s text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him but concluded that he would hold his own press conference after Dwyer&#x27;s. &quot;I had to make it known that I was not aware of the content of the statement. I didn&#x27;t want it to be thought that I wrote that for him.&quot;

Upon reaching the final page of his statement, which had not been distributed to the press nor press secretary Horshock in advance, Dwyer paused. &quot;... and I&#x27;m on the last page now, and I don&#x27;t have enough to pass out, but Duke [Horshock], I&#x27;ll leave this here, and you can make copies for the people; there&#x27;s a few extra copies here right now.&quot; Dwyer continued,

At this time, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion of the prepared text remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows (he did not read these comments to the crowd):

After deciding to break from his speech, Dwyer called to three of his staffers, giving each a sealed envelope with the insignia of the treasury department. The first envelope, given to Bob Holste, contained a letter addressed to then-Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey, who had assumed office just two days earlier. The second, given to deputy press secretary Gregory Penny, contained an organ donor card and other related materials. The last, given to Deputy Treasurer Don Johnson, contained materials intended for Dwyer&#x27;s family, including three letters: one for his wife Joanne, and one for each of his children, Rob and DeeDee (Dyan), and suggested funeral arrangements.

Freelance photographer Gary Miller, one of the reporters in attendance, described the scene at this time, stating: &quot;It was just kind of a long-winded, sad event.&quot;

=== Suicide ===

After he had finished speaking and handing out the notes to his staffers, Dwyer grabbed a manila envelope and drew a Model 19 .357 Magnum revolver from it, causing others to panic. Dwyer backed up against the wall, holding the weapon close to his body, and said, &quot;Please, please leave the room if this will... if this will affect you.&quot;

Reporters David Morris of the Associated Press, Thom Cole of UPI and Gary Warner of afternoon newspaper &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; were at the rear of the room, waiting for Dwyer to say he had resigned, so they could run down the hall to telephones to tell their editors they could publish pre-written stories and add Dwyer&#x27;s direct quote. When Dwyer produced the revolver, the three ran into the hallway and shouted to a state police kiosk in the center of the long hallway that the treasurer had a gun.

Among those who stayed, some pleaded with Dwyer to surrender the gun while others tried to approach him and seize the weapon. Dwyer warned against either action, exclaiming his last words, telling them that it &quot;will hurt someone&quot;.

Dwyer then put the muzzle of the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger, firing a shot through the roof of his mouth and into his brain. He collapsed on the floor, dead.

Nine news cameras recorded the events. One of the cameras remained focused on Dwyer and captured close-up footage of the aftermath of the shooting; as his body slumped, blood streamed from the exit wound in the back of his head as well as from his nostrils and mouth. He died instantly from the gunshot shortly before 11:00 a.m. EST but was not pronounced dead until 11:31 a.m. An aide later stated that Dwyer&#x27;s corneas were made available for transplant per his organ donation wishes, but that no other organs were usable by the time his body reached a hospital. Dwyer was interred at Blooming Valley Cemetery in Saegertown on January 26.

===Footage and television media===

Many television stations throughout Pennsylvania broadcast taped footage of Dwyer&#x27;s suicide to a midday audience. Philadelphia station WPVI (Channel6) showed Dwyer pulling the trigger and falling backwards, but did not show the bullet path. During the next several hours, news editors had to decide how much of the graphic footage they wanted to broadcast. Many chose not to broadcast the final moments of the suicide and WPVI also chose not to show the gunshot a second time.

Many stations, including WCAU and Pennsylvania&#x27;s Group W stations KYW and KDKA-TV, stopped the action just before the gunshot. However, the latter two allowed the audio of the shooting to continue with the stopped image. GroupW&#x27;s news cameraman William L. Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to broadcast the audio with a freeze-frame of the gun in Dwyer&#x27;s mouth. Only a handful broadcast the unedited press conference. WPVI in Philadelphia rebroadcast the suicide footage in full on their 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Action News broadcast without warning the viewers. That station&#x27;s broadcast is a source for copies available on the Internet. WPXI in Pittsburgh is reported by the Associated Press to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast. In explaining the decision to broadcast, WPXI operations manager By Williams said, &quot;It&#x27;s an important event [about] an important man&quot;. Williams avoided broadcasting the footage in the evening newscasts, explaining, &quot;Everyone knows by then that [Dwyer] did it. There are children out of school.&quot; However, in central Pennsylvania, many children were home from school during the day of Dwyer&#x27;s suicide due to a snowstorm.

The moment of Dwyer&#x27;s suicide did not appear on any national newscast. &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and CNN&#x27;s coverage only showed Dwyer holding the gun and stopped before he placed it in his mouth, and &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; did not include any footage from the press conference in their reports.

Some older students joked about the event. A study of the incidence of the jokes showed that they were told only in areas where stations showed uncensored footage of the press conference. At least one reporter present at Dwyer&#x27;s suicide suffered from being a witness: radio reporter Tony Romeo, who was standing a few feet from Dwyer, developed depression after the suicide and took a break from journalism.

Dwyer&#x27;s mistrust of outgoing Republican Governor Dick Thornburgh was expressed in detail in his press conference statement. The timing of Dwyer&#x27;s press conference and suicide meant that Thornburgh was not empowered to appoint a Treasurer to replace him. Instead, this became the responsibility of Thornburgh&#x27;s successor, Democrat Bob Casey, who had assumed office on January 20.

The letter Dwyer sent Casey stated, &quot;By the time you receive this letter ... the office of State Treasurer of Pennsylvania will be vacant. I stress to you that I did not resign but was State Treasurer of Pennsylvania to the end.&quot; It also stated that Casey &quot;will be the great Governor that Pennsylvania needs at this time in our history&quot;. He suggested his wife Joanne as his successor, describing her as &quot;very talented, personable, organized and hard-working.&quot;

Governor Casey did not accept Dwyer&#x27;s suggestion. Regardless of the events of January 22, the governor and legislature of Pennsylvania already expected Dwyer to either resign or be dismissed from office. As such, a deal had already been brokered wherein the next treasurer, a Democrat, would serve the remnant of Dwyer&#x27;s term and resign at its end. This was G. Davis Greene Jr., who was appointed as the 71st Treasurer of Pennsylvania on January 23, 1987, the day after Dwyer&#x27;s suicide.

In 2010, former U.S. attorney James West, who prosecuted Dwyer, affirmed Dwyer&#x27;s guilt, stating that &quot;the evidence against Dwyer was overwhelming and indisputable&quot;.

In his final press statement, Dwyer alleged that Governor Thornburgh along with prosecutor James West, engaged in a political vendetta against him, and that FBI agents had acted improperly in their investigation. After Dwyer&#x27;s public suicide, the National Association of State Treasurers requested that Dwyer&#x27;s allegations be reviewed by the Department of Justice. After a thorough investigation, the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility exonerated attorney James West and everyone else involved in Dwyer&#x27;s investigation and prosecution of any wrongdoing. The FBI also investigated Dwyer&#x27;s claims regarding impropriety on behalf of FBI personnel. They ultimately found Dwyer&#x27;s claims to be &quot;lacking in substance and specificity&quot; and warranting no further action. R.B. Swift, former Capitol reporter, noted that Dwyer&#x27;s allegations were extensively investigated by journalists from both &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and the Associated Press, but no evidence was found to substantiate them.

Dwyer claimed that Governor Thornburgh sought revenge against him, since Dwyer had angered Thornburgh when he refused publicly to approve expense vouchers for Thornburgh&#x27;s wife for a European visit, and, additionally, when he criticized Thornburgh&#x27;s use of state police to chauffeur his son to school. In response, Thornburgh pointed out that prior to their European visit, the Thornburgh family had issued a press release specifically stating that Ginny Thornburgh would pay her own expenses. Upon their return to Pennsylvania, Mrs. Thornburgh &quot;repeatedly requested&quot; the Thornburgh staff to &quot;advise her of the amount&quot; to be reimbursed; however, Dwyer leaked this matter to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in an attempt to &quot;enhance his own image by embarrassing&quot; Thornburgh and his family. Regarding the use of the state police, Thornburgh stated that &quot;the security detail provided its services to all members of our household as the officers deemed necessary for our protection. We neither asked for nor questioned these services, which were no different than those provided to our predecessors.&quot; Thornburgh spokesman David Runkel dismissed Dwyer&#x27;s allegations as being &quot;paranoic&quot;, as did John Taylor, the former spokesman for Governor Bob Casey. Pennsylvanian journalist and author Brad Bumsted suggested that Dwyer&#x27;s allegations against Thornburgh may have been an attempt to divert attention from his own criminal activity with CTA. Bumsted also stated that, in Dwyer&#x27;s final press statement, Dwyer &quot;offered no real evidence&quot; that there was any conspiracy against him.

Dwyer&#x27;s deputy press secretary Gregory Penny, who was handed an envelope by Dwyer at Dwyer&#x27;s final press conference, stated that he was convinced that Dwyer, whom he had once defended, had been guilty all along:

===Death benefits===
Since Dwyer died in office, his widow Joanne was able to collect full survivor benefits totaling more than (equivalent to about $M in ), which at the time was the largest death benefit payment ever made by the Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System. If Dwyer had been sentenced, state law would have prohibited the payment of his state-provided pension benefits. A spokesman for Dwyer suggested that he may have killed himself to preserve the pension benefits for his family, whose finances had been ruined by legal defense costs. Other statements made by some friends and family also suggest that this was Dwyer&#x27;s motivation.

At a panel discussion for the documentary &quot;Honest Man: The Life of R. Budd Dwyer&quot;, Dwyer&#x27;s sister Mary Kun stated that Dwyer had made the decision to kill himself prior to knowing he would lose his pension and thus his motivation for his suicide was not to provide financial assurance for his family, but rather to &quot;sacrifice himself to help the system.&quot;

==Appeals==
On January 27, 1987, Dwyer&#x27;s lawyers filed an appeal in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking the dismissal of all post-trial motions that were then pending against Dwyer, abatement of Dwyer&#x27;s conviction and the dismissal of his May 13, 1986, indictment. On March 5, 1987, the district court denied all motions, stating that &quot;there were no grounds whatsoever upon which Mr. Dwyer could hope to succeed upon appeal&quot; and ordered to &quot;close this file as to R. Budd Dwyer&quot;. Dwyer&#x27;s lawyers appealed this decision, and The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit subsequently vacated the judgment. On remand, the district court was instructed to dismiss Dwyer&#x27;s motions (since the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction), and Dwyer&#x27;s convictions for mail fraud and conspiracy were sustained. Six years after Dwyer&#x27;s death, efforts were made to exonerate Dwyer when a retrial request was filed in U.S. District Court in July 1993. This request was denied in October of the same year.

<text>&#x27; (; On the Nature of Things&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is a first-century BC didactic poem by the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius () with the goal of explaining Epicurean philosophy to a Roman audience. The poem, written in some 7,400 dactylic hexameters, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through poetic language and metaphors. Namely, Lucretius explores the principles of atomism; the nature of the mind and soul; explanations of sensation and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena. The universe described in the poem operates according to these physical principles, guided by &quot;fortuna&quot; (&quot;chance&quot;), and not the divine intervention of the traditional Roman deities.

==Background==

To the Greek philosopher Epicurus, the unhappiness and degradation of humans arose largely from the dread which they had of the power of the deities and terror of their wrath. This wrath was supposed to be displayed by the misfortunes inflicted in this life and by the everlasting tortures that were the lot of the guilty in a future state or, where these feelings were not strongly developed, from a vague dread of gloom and misery after death. Epicurus thus made it his mission to remove these fears and thus establish tranquility in the minds of his readers. To do this, Epicurus invoked the atomism of Democritus to demonstrate that the material universe was formed not by a Supreme Being but by the mixing of elemental particles which had existed from all eternity, governed by certain simple laws. He argued that the deities (whose existence he did not deny) lived forever in the enjoyment of absolute peacestrangers to all the passions, desires and fears, which affect humansand are totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike by their virtues and their crimes. This meant that humans had nothing to fear from them.

Lucretius&#x27;s task was clearly to state and fully develop these views in an attractive form. His work was an attempt to show through poetry that everything in nature can be explained by natural laws, without the need for the intervention of divine beings. Lucretius identifies the supernatural with the notion that the deities created our world or interfere with its operations in some way. He argues against fear of such deities by demonstrating, through observations and arguments, that the operations of the world can be accounted for in terms of natural phenomena, which are the result of regular but purposeless motions and interactions of tiny atoms in empty space.

==Contents==
===Synopsis===

The poem consists of six untitled books, in dactylic hexameter. The first three books provide a fundamental account of being and nothingness, matter and space, the atoms and their movement, the infinity of the universe both as regards time and space, the regularity of reproduction (no prodigies, everything in its proper habitat), the nature of mind (&quot;animus&quot;, directing thought) and spirit (&quot;anima&quot;, sentience) as material bodily entities, and their mortality, since, according to Lucretius, they and their functions (consciousness, pain) end with the bodies that contain them and with which they are interwoven. The last three books give an atomic and materialist explanation of phenomena preoccupying human reflection, such as vision and the senses, sex and reproduction, natural forces and agriculture, the heavens, and disease.

Lucretius opens his poem by addressing Venus as the mother of Rome (&quot;Aeneadum genetrix&quot;) and the mother of nature (&quot;Alma Venus&quot;), urging her to pacify her lover Mars and spare Rome from strife. By recalling the opening to poems by Homer, Ennius, and Hesiod (all of which begin with an invocation to the Muses), the to conforms to epic convention. The entire proem is also written in the format of a hymn, recalling other early literary works, texts, and hymns and in particular the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite. The choice to address Venus may have been due to Empedocles&#x27;s belief that Aphrodite represents &quot;the great creative force in the cosmos&quot;. Given that Lucretius goes on to argue that the gods are removed from human life, many have thus seen this opening to be contradictory: how can Lucretius pray to Venus and then deny that the gods listen to or care about human affairs? In response, many scholars argue that the poet uses Venus poetically as a metonym. For instance, Diskin Clay sees Venus as a poetic substitute for sex, and Bonnie Catto sees the invocation of the name as a metonym for the &quot;creative process of &quot;natura&quot;&quot;.

After the opening, the poem commences with an enunciation of the proposition on the nature and being of the deities, which leads to an invective against the evils of superstition. Lucretius then dedicates time to exploring the axiom that nothing can be produced from nothing, and that nothing can be reduced to nothing (&quot;Nil fieri ex nihilo, in nihilum nil posse reverti&quot;). Following this, the poet argues that the universe comprises an infinite number of Atoms, which are scattered about in an infinite and vast void (&quot;Inane&quot;). The shape of these atoms, their properties, their movements, the laws under which they enter into combination and assume forms and qualities appreciable by the senses, with other preliminary matters on their nature and affections, together with a refutation of objections and opposing hypotheses, occupy the first two books.

In the third book, the general concepts proposed thus far are applied to demonstrate that the vital and intellectual principles, the &quot;Anima&quot; and &quot;Animus&quot;, are as much a part of us as are our limbs and members, but like those limbs and members have no distinct and independent existence, and that hence soul and body live and perish together; the book concludes by arguing that the fear of death is a folly, as death merely extinguishes all feelingboth the good and the bad.

The fourth book is devoted to the theory of the senses, sight, hearing, taste, smell, of sleep and of dreams, ending with a disquisition upon love and sex.

The fifth book is described by Ramsay as the most finished and impressive, while Stahl argues that its &quot;puerile conceptions&quot; are proof that Lucretius should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist. This book addresses the origin of the world and of all things therein, the movements of the heavenly bodies, the changing of the seasons, day and night, the rise and progress of humankind, society, political institutions, and the invention of the various arts and sciences which embellish and ennoble life.

The sixth book contains an explanation of some of the most striking natural appearances, especially thunder, lightning, hail, rain, snow, ice, cold, heat, wind, earthquakes, volcanoes, springs and localities noxious to animal life, which leads to a discourse upon diseases. This introduces a detailed description of the great pestilence that devastated Athens during the Peloponnesian War. With this episode, the book closes; this abrupt ending suggests that Lucretius might have died before he was able to finalize and fully edit his poem.

===Purpose===

Lucretius wrote this epic poem to &quot;Memmius&quot;, who may be Gaius Memmius, who in 58 BC was a praetor, a judicial official deciding controversies between citizens and the government. There are over a dozen references to &quot;Memmius&quot; scattered throughout the long poem in a variety of contexts in translation, such as &quot;Memmius mine&quot;, &quot;my Memmius&quot;, and &quot;illustrious Memmius&quot;. According to Lucretius&#x27;s frequent statements in his poem, the main purpose of the work was to free Gaius Memmius&#x27;s mind of the supernatural and the fear of death—and to induct him into a state of &quot;ataraxia&quot; by expounding the philosophical system of Epicurus, whom Lucretius glorifies as the hero of his epic poem.

However, the purpose of the poem is subject to ongoing scholarly debate. Lucretius refers to Memmius by name four times in the first book, three times in the second, five in the fifth, and not at all in the third, fourth, or sixth books. In relation to this discrepancy in the frequency of Lucretius&#x27;s reference to the apparent subject of his poem, Kannengiesser advances the theory that Lucretius wrote the first version of for the reader at large, and subsequently revised in order to write it for Memmius. However, Memmius&#x27; name is central to several critical verses in the poem, and this theory has therefore been largely discredited. The German classicists Ivo Bruns and Samuel Brandt set forth an alternative theory that Lucretius did at first write the poem with Memmius in mind, but that his enthusiasm for his patron cooled over time. Stearns suggests that this is because Memmius reneged on a promise to pay for a new school to be built on the site of the old Epicurean school. Memmius was also a tribune in 66, praetor in 58, governor of Bithynia in 57, and was a candidate for the consulship in 54 but was disqualified for bribery, and Stearns suggests that the warm relationship between patron and client may have cooled (&quot;sed tua me virtus tamen et sperata voluptas&quot; / &quot;suavis amicitiae quemvis efferre laborem&quot;, &quot;But still your merit, and as I hope, the joy / Of our sweet friendship, urge me to any toil&quot;).

There is a certain irony to the poem, namely that while Lucretius extols the virtue of the Epicurean school of thought, Epicurus himself had advised his acolytes from penning poetry because he believed it to make that which was simple overly complicated. Near the end of his first book, Lucretius defends his fusion of Epicureanism and poetry with a simile, arguing that the philosophy he espouses is like a medicine: life-saving but often unpleasant. Poetry, on the other hand, is like honey, in that it is &quot;a sweetener that sugarcoats the bitter medicine of Epicurean philosophy and entices the audience to swallow it.&quot; (Of note, Lucretius repeats these 25 lines, almost verbatim, in the introduction to the fourth book.)

===Completeness===

The state of the poem as it currently exists suggests that it was released in an unfinished state. For instance, the poem concludes rather abruptly while detailing the Plague of Athens, there are redundant passages throughout (e.g., 1.820–821 and 2.1015–1016) alongside other aesthetic &quot;loose ends&quot;, and at 5.155 Lucretius mentions that he will spend a great deal of time discussing the nature of the gods, which never comes to pass. Some have suggested that Lucretius died before being able to edit, finalize, and publish his work.

==Main ideas==

===Metaphysics===

====Lack of divine intervention====
After the poem was rediscovered and made its rounds across Europe and beyond, numerous thinkers began to see Lucretius&#x27;s Epicureanism as a &quot;threat synonymous with atheism.&quot; Some Christian apologists viewed as an atheist manifesto and a dangerous foil to be thwarted. However, at that time the label was extremely broad and did not necessarily mean a denial of divine entities (for example, some large Christian sects labelled dissenting groups as atheists). What is more, Lucretius does not deny the existence of deities; he simply argues that they did not create the universe, that they do not care about human affairs, and that they do not intervene in the world. Regardless, due to the ideas espoused in the poem, much of Lucretius&#x27;s work was seen by many as a direct challenge to theistic, Christian belief. The historian Ada Palmer has labelled six ideas in Lucretius&#x27;s thought (viz. his assertion that the world was created from chaos, and his denials of Providence, divine participation, miracles, the efficacy of prayer, and an afterlife) as &quot;proto-atheistic&quot;. She qualifies her use of this term, cautioning that it is not to be used to say that Lucretius was himself an atheist in the modern sense of the word, nor that atheism is a teleological necessity, but rather that many of his ideas were taken up by 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century atheists.

====Repudiation of immortality====

 does not argue that the soul does not exist; rather, the poem claims that the soul, like all things in existence, is made up of atoms, and because these atoms will one day drift apart, the human soul is not immortal. Lucretius thus argues that death is simply annihilation, and that there is no afterlife. He likens the physical body to a vessel that holds both the mind (&quot;mens&quot;) and spirit (&quot;anima&quot;). To prove that neither the mind nor spirit can survive independent of the body, Lucretius uses a simple analogy: when a vessel shatters, its contents spill everywhere; likewise, when the body dies, the mind and spirit dissipate. And as a simple ceasing-to-be, death can be neither good nor bad for this being, since a dead personbeing completely devoid of sensation and thoughtcannot miss being alive. To further alleviate the fear of non-existence, Lucretius makes use of the symmetry argument: he argues that the eternal oblivion awaiting all humans after death is exactly the same as the infinite nothingness that preceded our birth. Since that nothingness (which he likens to a deep, peaceful sleep) caused us no pain or discomfort, we should not fear the same nothingness that will follow our own demise:
:Look back againhow the endless ages of time comes to pass
:Before our birth are nothing to us. This is a looking glass
:Nature holds up for us in which we see the time to come
:After we finally die. What is there that looks so fearsome?
:What&#x27;s so tragic? Isn&#x27;t it more peaceful than any sleep?

According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, Lucretius sees those who fear death as embracing the fallacious assumption that they will be present in some sense &quot;to regret and bewail [their] own non-existence.&quot;

===Physics===

Lucretius maintained that he could free humankind from fear of the deities by demonstrating that all things occur by natural causes without any intervention by the deities. Historians of science, however, have been critical of the limitations of his Epicurean approach to science, especially as it pertained to astronomical topics, which he relegated to the class of &quot;unclear&quot; objects.

Thus, he began his discussion by claiming that he would
explain by what forces nature steers the courses of the Sun and the journeyings of the Moon, so that we shall not suppose that they run their yearly races between heaven and earth of their own free will [i.e., are gods themselves] or that they are rolled round in furtherance of some divine plan...

However, when he set out to put this plan into practice, he limited himself to showing how one, or several different, naturalistic accounts could explain certain natural phenomena. He was unable to tell his readers how to determine which of these alternatives might be the true one. For instance, when considering the reason for stellar movements, Lucretius provides two possible explanations: that the sky itself rotates, or that the sky as a whole is stationary while constellations move. If the latter is true, Lucretius, notes, this is because: &quot;either swift currents of ether whirl round and round and roll their fires at large across the nocturnal regions of the sky&quot;; &quot;an external current of air from some other quarter may whirl them along in their course&quot;; or &quot;they may swim of their own accord, each responsive to the call of its own food, and feed their fiery bodies in the broad pastures of the sky&quot;. Lucretius concludes that &quot;one of these causes must certainly operate in our world... But to lay down which of them it is lies beyond the range of our stumbling progress.&quot;

Despite his advocacy of empiricism and his many correct conjectures about atomism and the nature of the physical world, Lucretius concludes his first book stressing the absurdity of the (by then well-established) spherical Earth theory, favoring instead a flat Earth cosmology.

Drawing on these, and other passages, William Stahl considered that &quot;The anomalous and derivative character of the scientific portions of Lucretius&#x27; poem makes it reasonable to conclude that his significance should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist.&quot; His naturalistic explanations were meant to bolster the ethical and philosophical ideas of Epicureanism, not to reveal true explanations of the physical world.

====The swerve====

Determinism appears to conflict with the concept of free will. Lucretius attempts to allow for free will in his physicalistic universe by postulating an indeterministic tendency for atoms to veer randomly (, literally &quot;the turning aside of a thing&quot;, but often translated as &quot;the swerve&quot;). According to Lucretius, this unpredictable swerve occurs at no fixed place or time:

When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they deflect a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, just enough that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through the depths of the void, like drops of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced anything.

This swerving provides the indeterminacy that Lucretius argues allows for the &quot;free will which living things throughout the world have&quot; (&quot;libera per terras&quot; ... &quot;haec animantibus exstat&quot; ... &quot;voluntas&quot;).

==Textual history==

===Classical antiquity to the Middle Ages===

Martin Ferguson Smith notes that Cicero&#x27;s close friend, Titus Pomponius Atticus, was an Epicurean publisher, and it is possible his slaves made the very first copies of . If this were the case, then it might explain how Cicero came to be familiar with Lucretius&#x27;s work. In c. AD 380, St. Jerome would contend in his &quot;Chronicon&quot; that Cicero amended and edited , although most scholars argue that this is an erroneous claim; the classicist David Butterfield argues that this mistake was likely made by Jerome (or his sources) because the earliest reference to Lucretius is in the aforementioned letter from Cicero. Nevertheless, a small minority of scholars argue that Jerome&#x27;s assertion may be credible.

The oldest purported fragments of were published by K. Kleve in 1989 and consist of sixteen fragments. These remnants were discovered among the Epicurean library in the Villa of the Papyri, Herculaneum. Because, as W. H. D. Rouse notes, &quot;the fragments are so minute and bear so few certainly identifiable letters&quot;, at this point in time &quot;some scepticism about their proposed authorship seems pardonable and prudent.&quot; However, Kleve contends that four of the six books are represented in the fragments, which he argues is reason to assume that the entire poem was at one time kept in the library. If Lucretius&#x27;s poem were to be definitely placed at the Villa of the Papyri, it would suggest that it was studied by the Neapolitan Epicurean school.

Copies of the poem were preserved in a number of medieval libraries, with the earliest extant manuscripts dating to the ninth century. The oldestand, according to David Butterfield, most famousof these is the Codex Oblongus, often called O. This copy has been dated to the early ninth century and was produced by a Carolingian scriptorium (likely a monastery connected to the court of Charlemagne). O is currently housed at Leiden University Libraries as MS VLF 30. The second of these ninth-century manuscripts is the Codex Quadratus, often called Q. This manuscript was likely copied after O, sometime in the mid-ninth century. Today, Q is also housed at Leiden University Libraries as VLQ 94. The third and final ninth-century manuscriptwhich comprises the &quot;Schedae Gottorpienses&quot; fragment (commonly called G and located in the Kongelige Bibliotek of Copenhagen) and the &quot;Schedae Vindobonenses&quot; fragments (commonly called V and U and located in the Austrian National Library in Vienna)was christened by Butterfield as S and has been dated to the latter part of the ninth century. Scholars consider manuscripts O, Q, and S to all be descendants of the original archetype, which they dub Ω. However, while O is a direct descendant of the archetype, Q and S are believed to have both been derived from a manuscript (Ψ) that in turn had been derived from a damaged and modified version of the archetype (ΩI).

===Rediscovery to the present===

While there exist a handful of references to Lucretius in European sources dating between the ninth and fifteenth centuries (references that, according to Ada Palmer, &quot;indicate a tenacious, if spotty knowledge of the poet and some knowledge of [his] poem&quot;), no manuscripts of are known to survive from this span of time. Rather, all the remaining Lucretian manuscripts, apart from the early three discussed above, that are known date from or after the fifteenth century. This is because was rediscovered in January 1417 by Poggio Bracciolini, who probably found the poem in the Benedictine library at Fulda. The manuscript that Poggio discovered did not survive, but a copy (the &quot;Codex Laurentianus 35.30&quot;) of it by Poggio&#x27;s friend, Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli, did, and today it is kept at the Laurentian Library in Florence.

Machiavelli made a copy early in his life. Molière produced a verse translation which does not survive; John Evelyn translated the first book.

The Italian scholar Guido Billanovich demonstrated that Lucretius&#x27; poem was well known in its entirety by Lovato Lovati (1241–1309) and some other Paduan pre-humanists during the thirteenth century. This proves that the work was known in select circles long before the official rediscovery by Bracciolini. It has been suggested that Dante (1265–1321) might have read Lucretius&#x27;s poem, as a few verses of his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; exhibit a great affinity with , but there is no conclusive evidence for this hypothesis.

The first printed edition of was produced in Brescia, Lombardy, in 1473. Other printed editions followed soon after. Additionally, although only published in 1996, Lucy Hutchinson&#x27;s translation of was in all likelihood the first in English and was most likely completed some time in the late 1640s or 1650s, though it remained unpublished in manuscript.
==Reception==

===Classical antiquity===

The earliest recorded critique of Lucretius&#x27;s work is in a letter written by the Roman statesman Cicero to his brother Quintus, in which the former claims that Lucretius&#x27;s poetry is &quot;full of inspired brilliance, but also of great artistry&quot; (&quot;Lucreti poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt, multis luminibus ingeni, multae tamen artis&quot;).

It is also believed that G. Julius Caesar alludes to Lucretius&#x27; work variously in his Gallic Wars, just as the Roman poet Virgil referenced Lucretius and his work in the second book of his &quot;Georgics&quot; when he wrote: &quot;Happy is he who has discovered the causes of things and has cast beneath his feet all fears, unavoidable fate, and the din of the devouring Underworld&quot; (&quot;felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas&quot;/&quot;atque metus omnis et inexorabile fatum&quot;/&quot;subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari&quot;). According to David Sedley of the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, &quot;With these admiring words, Virgil neatly encapsulates four dominant themes of the poemuniversal causal explanation, leading to elimination of the threats the world seems to pose, a vindication of free will, and disproof of the soul&#x27;s survival after death.&quot;

Lucretius was almost certainly read by the imperial poet Marcus Manilius (fl. 1st century AD), whose didactic poem &quot;Astronomica&quot; (written ) alludes to in a number of places. However, Manilius&#x27;s poem espouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of the universe, and by its very nature attacks the very philosophical underpinnings of Lucretius&#x27;s worldview. This has led scholars like Katharina Volk to argue that &quot;Manilius is a veritable anti-Lucretius&quot;. What is more, Manilius also seems to suggest throughout this poem that his work is superior to that of Lucretius&#x27;s. (Coincidentally, and the &quot;Astronomica&quot; were both rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini in the early 15th century.)

Additionally, Lucretius&#x27;s work is discussed by the Augustan poet Ovid, who in his &quot;Amores&quot; writes &quot;the verses of the sublime Lucretius will perish only when a day will bring the end of the world&quot; (&quot;Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti / exitio terras cum dabit una dies&quot;), and the Silver Age poet Statius, who in his &quot;Silvae&quot; praises Lucretius as being highly &quot;learned&quot;. David Butterfield also writes that &quot;clear echoes and/or responses&quot; to can be detected in the works of the Roman elegiac poets Catullus, Propertius, and Tibullus, as well as the lyric poet Horace.

In regards to prose writers, a number either quote from Lucretius&#x27;s poem or express great admiration for , including Vitruvius (in ), Marcus Velleius Paterculus (in the &quot;Historiae Romanae&quot;), Quintilian (in the &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;), Tacitus (in the &quot;Dialogus de oratoribus&quot;), Marcus Cornelius Fronto (in &quot;De eloquentia&quot;), Cornelius Nepos (in the &quot;Life of Atticus&quot;), Apuleius (in &quot;De Deo Socratis&quot;), and Gaius Julius Hyginus (in the &quot;Fabulae&quot;). Additionally, Pliny the Elder lists Lucretius (presumably referring to his ) as a source at the beginning of his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, and Seneca the Younger quoted six passages from across several of his works.

===Late antiquity and the Middle Ages===

Because Lucretius was critical of religion and the claim of an immortal soul, his poem was disparaged by most early Church Fathers. The Early Christian apologist Lactantius, in particular, heavily cites and critiques Lucretius in his &quot;The Divine Institutes&quot; and its &quot;Epitome&quot;, as well as his &quot;De ira Dei&quot;. While he argued that Lucretius&#x27;s criticism of Roman religion were &quot;sound attacks on paganism and superstition&quot;, Lactantius claimed that they were futile against the &quot;True Faith&quot; of Christianity. Lactantius also disparages the science of (as well as of Epicureanism in general), calls Lucretius &quot;the most worthless of the poets&quot; (&quot;poeta inanissimus&quot;), notes that he is unable to read more than a few lines of without laughing, and sarcastically asks, &quot;Who would think that [Lucretius] had a brain when he said these things?&quot;

After Lactantius&#x27;s time, Lucretius was almost exclusively referenced or alluded to in a negative manner by the Church Fathers. The one major exception to this was Isidore of Seville, who at the start of the 7th century produced a work on astronomy and natural history dedicated to the Visigothic king Sisebut that was entitled &quot;De natura rerum&quot;. In both this work, and as well as his more well-known &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (c. AD 600625), Isidore liberally quotes from Lucretius a total of twelve times, drawing verses from all of Lucretius&#x27;s books except his third. (About a century later, the British historian and Doctor of the Church Bede produced a work also called &quot;De natura rerum&quot;, partly based on Isidore&#x27;s work but apparently ignorant of Lucretius&#x27;s poem.)

===Renaissance to the present===

Montaigne owned a Latin edition published in Paris, in 1563, by Denis Lambin which he heavily annotated. His &quot;Essays&quot; contain almost a hundred quotes from . Additionally, in his essay &quot;Of Books&quot;, he lists Lucretius along with Virgil, Horace, and Catullus as his four top poets.

Notable figures who owned copies include Ben Jonson, whose copy is held at the Houghton Library, Harvard; and Thomas Jefferson, who owned at least five Latin editions and English, Italian and French translations.

Lucretius has also had a marked influence upon modern philosophy, as perhaps the most complete expositor of Epicurean thought. His influence is especially notable in the work of the Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, who praised Lucretiusalong with Dante and Goethein his book &quot;Three Philosophical Poets&quot;, although he openly admired the poet&#x27;s system of physics more so than his spiritual musings (referring to the latter as &quot;fumbling, timid and sad&quot;).

In 2011, the historian and literary scholar Stephen Greenblatt wrote a popular history book about the poem, entitled &quot;The Swerve: How the World Became Modern&quot;. In the work, Greenblatt argues that Poggio Bracciolini&#x27;s discovery of reintroduced important ideas that sparked the modern age. The book was well-received, and later earned the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and the 2011 National Book Award for Nonfiction.

<text>In medicine, paresis (), compound word from Greek , (πᾰρᾰ- “beside” + ἵημι “let go, release”), is a condition typified by a weakness of voluntary movement, or by partial loss of voluntary movement or by impaired movement. When used without qualifiers, it usually refers to the limbs, but it can also be used to describe the muscles of the eyes (ophthalmoparesis), the stomach (gastroparesis), and also the vocal cords (vocal cord paresis). 

Neurologists use the term &quot;paresis&quot; to describe weakness, and &quot;plegia&quot; to describe paralysis in which all voluntary movement is lost. The term &quot;paresis&quot; comes from the &#x27;letting go&#x27; from παρίημι &#x27;to let go, to let fall&#x27;.

==Types==

===Limbs===
* Monoparesis – One leg or one arm
* Paraparesis – Both legs
* Hemiparesis – The loss of function to only one side of the body
* Triparesis – Three limbs. This can either mean both legs and one arm, both arms and a leg, or a combination of one arm, one leg, and face
* Double hemiparesis – All four limbs are involved, but one side of the body is more affected than the other
* Tetraparesis – All four limbs
* Quadriparesis – All four limbs, equally affected
* These terms frequently refer to the impairment of motion in multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy

===Other===
* Gastroparesis – impaired stomach emptying
* A form of ophthalmoplegia
* Spastic paresis – exaggerated tendon reflexes and muscle hypertonia
* In the past, the term was most commonly used to refer to &quot;general paresis&quot;, which was a symptom of untreated syphilis. However, due to improvements in treatment of syphilis, it is now rarely used in this context.

<doc id="272190" wikidata="Q31789" url="?curid=272190" title="Chancre">
<text>A chancre ( ) is a painless genital ulcer most commonly formed during the primary stage of syphilis. This infectious lesion forms around 21 days after the initial exposure to &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, the gram-negative spirochaete bacterium causing syphilis, but can range from 10 to 90 days. Without treatment it may persist for two to six weeks before healing. Chancres transmit syphilis through direct physical contact. These ulcers usually form on or around the anus, mouth, penis and vulva. 

Chancres are also associated with the African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), surrounding the area of the tsetse fly bite.

== Similarities with chancroid ==
Similarities between the conditions chancre and chancroid:
* Both originate as pustules at the site of inoculation, and progress to ulcerated lesions
* Both lesions are typically 1–2 cm in diameter
* Both lesions are caused by sexually transmissible organisms
* Both lesions typically appear on the genitals of infected individuals

== Differences from chancroid ==
* Chancres can occur in the pharynx as well as on the genitals. Not to be confused with condylomata lata, which is seen in secondary syphilis.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;chancre&quot; () means &quot;little ulcer&quot; in Old French. Related to the English &quot;canker&quot;, they both come from the Latin &quot;cancer&quot;, meaning &quot;crab&quot;, which is a translation from the Greek word καρκίνος (&quot;karkínos&quot;), also meaning &quot;crab&quot;.

* Primary cutaneous histoplasmosis

<doc id="272204" wikidata="Q154250" url="?curid=272204" title="Tavern">
<text>A tavern is a type of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and be served food such as different types of roast meats and cheese, and (mostly historically) where travelers would receive lodging. An inn is a tavern that has a licence to put up guests as lodgers. The word derives from the Latin &quot;taberna&quot; whose original meaning was a shed, workshop, stall, or pub.

Over time, the words &quot;tavern&quot; and &quot;inn&quot; became interchangeable and synonymous. In England, inns started to be referred to as public houses or pubs and the term became standard for all drinking houses.

==Europe==

===France===
From at least the 14th century, taverns, along with inns, were the main places to dine out. Typically, a tavern offered various roast meats, as well as simple foods like bread, cheese, herring, and bacon. Some offered a wider variety of foods, though it would be cabarets and later &quot;traiteurs&quot; which offered the finest meals before the restaurant appeared in the 18th century. Their stated purpose, however, was to serve wine (not beer or cider, which had other outlets) and they were so disreputable that women of any standing avoided them.

After 1500, taxes on wine and other alcoholic beverages grew increasingly more burdensome, not only because of the continual increase in the level of taxation but also because of the bewildering variety and multiplicity of the taxes. This chaotic system was enforced by an army of tax collectors. The resultant opposition took many forms. Wine growers and tavern keepers concealed wine and falsified their methods of selling it to take advantage of lower tax rates. The retailers also refilled their casks secretly from hidden stocks. Wine merchants stealthily circumvented inspection stations to avoid local import duties. When apprehended, some defrauders reacted with passive resignation, while others resorted to violence. Situated at the heart of the country town or village, the tavern was one of the traditional centers of social and political life before 1789, a meeting place for both the local population and travelers passing through and a refuge for rogues and scoundrels. Taverns symbolized opposition to the regime and to religion.

Taverns sometimes served as restaurants. In Paris, the first restaurant in the modern sense of the term was founded in 1765. However, the first Parisian restaurant worthy of the name was the one founded by Beauvilliers in 1782 in the Rue de Richelieu, called the &quot;Grande Taverne de Londres&quot;.

Émile Zola&#x27;s novel &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; (&#x27;The Tavern&#x27;, 1877) depicted the social conditions typical of alcoholism in Paris among the working classes. The drunk destroyed not only his own body, but also his employment, his family, and other interpersonal relationships. The characters Gervaise Macquart and her husband Coupeau exemplified with great realism the physical and moral degradation of alcoholics. Zola&#x27;s correspondence with physicians reveals that he used authentic medical sources for his realistic depictions in the novel.

===Germany===
A common German name for German taverns or pubs is &quot;Kneipe&quot;. Drinking practices in 16th-century Augsburg, Germany, suggest that the use of alcohol in early modern Germany followed carefully structured cultural norms. Drinking was not a sign of insecurity and disorder. It helped define and enhance men&#x27;s social status and was therefore tolerated among men as long as they lived up to both the rules and norms of tavern society and the demands of their role as householders. Tavern doors were closed to respectable women unaccompanied by their husbands, and society condemned drunkenness among women, but when alcohol abuse interfered with the household, women could deploy public power to impose limits on men&#x27;s drinking behaviour.

===United Kingdom===

Taverns were popular places used for business as well as for eating and drinking – the London Tavern was a notable meeting place in the 18th and 19th centuries, for example. However, the word tavern is no longer in popular use in the UK as there is no distinction between a tavern and an inn. Both establishments serve wine and beer/ale. The term &#x27;pub&#x27; (an abbreviation of &#x27;public house&#x27;) is now used to describe these houses. The legacy of taverns and inns is now only found in the pub names, e.g. Fitzroy Tavern, Silver Cross Tavern, Spaniards Inn, etc. The word also survives in songs such as &quot;There is a Tavern in the Town&quot;.

The range and quality of pubs varies wildly throughout the UK as does the range of beers, wines, spirits and foods available. Most quality pubs will still serve cask ales and food. In recent years there has been a move towards &quot;gastro&quot; pubs where the menu is more ambitious. Originally, taverns served as rest stops about every fifteen miles and their main focus was to provide shelter to anyone who was traveling. Such taverns would be divided into two major parts – the sleeping quarters and the bar. There is generally a sign with some type of symbol, often related to the name of the premises, to draw in customers. The purpose of this is to indicate that the establishment sells alcohol and to set it apart from the competition.

===Scandinavia===
Scandinavia had very high drinking rates, which led to the formation of a powerful prohibition movement in the 19th century. Magnusson (1986) explains why consumption of spirits was so high in a typical preindustrial village (Eskilstuna) in Sweden, 1820–50. An economic feature of this town of blacksmiths was the &quot;Verlag&quot;, or outwork production system, with its complex network of credit relationships. The tavern played a crucial role in cultural and business life and was also the place where work and leisure were fused. Heavy drinking facilitated the creation of community relationships in which artisans and workers sought security. Buying drinks rather than saving money was a rational strategy when, before adjustment to a cash economy, it was essential to raise one&#x27;s esteem with fellow craftsmen to whom one could turn for favors in preference to the Verlag capitalist.

===Greece===
A restaurant in Greece is commonly known as a taverna. Their history begins in Classical times, with the earliest evidence of a taverna discovered at the Ancient Agora of Athens; the style remains the same to this day. Greek tavernes (plural of taverna) are the most common restaurants in Greece. A typical menu includes portion dishes, or small dishes of meat and fish, as well as salads and appetizers. &quot;Mageirefta&quot; is the menu section that includes a variety of different casserole cooked dishes every day. The other choices are mainly prepared roasted (&quot;tis oras)&quot; or fried. &quot;Orektika&quot; (appetizers) include small dishes of Greek sauces, &quot;alifes&quot;, usually eaten on bites of bread. Tavernes offer different kinds of wines and &quot;retsina&quot; in barrels or in bottles, &quot;ouzo&quot; or &quot;tsipouro&quot;, with beer and refreshments being a recent addition. In Byzantine times, tavernes were the place for a social gathering, to enjoy a meal, live music and friendly talk with a drink accompanied by small variety dishes (&quot;mezes&quot;).

===Former Yugoslavia===
In former Yugoslavia, the &quot;kafana&quot; serves food and alcoholic beverages.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
The most frequent Czech translation of tavern or pub is &quot;hospoda&quot;. It comes out from &quot;hospodář&quot; (landlord) and is also close to &quot;hostitel&quot; (host), &quot;host&quot; (guest) and &quot;hostina&quot; (dinner, banquet). And also to Russian &quot;gospodin&quot; (master, lord, sir) and, not to forget, to &quot;hospitality&quot;. Traditionally, &quot;hospoda&quot; or &quot;hostinec&quot; were full-fledged facilities, providing lodging, meals and drink, an inn. In modern times, the meaning of the word has a bit narrowed. Nevertheless, it is used colloquially to denote both traditional restaurants where people go to eat, and bars, where people mainly go to drink and socialize. &quot;Hospoda&quot; is nowadays a very widespread but only colloquial word, while &quot;hostinec&quot; or &quot;pohostinství&quot; were often official names of such establishment in the 20th century, now a bit obsolete. &quot;Hospoda&quot; could be with meals served or without, typically with tapped beer. (This term is not used for wine bars.) As drinking beer is an important part of the Czech culture, inviting to &quot;hospoda&quot; generally means: &quot;let&#x27;s go and have a drink together, let&#x27;s meet, chat, and socialize…&quot;. It is often equipped with a TV, billiards table, darts etc. Pubs serve both local regulars as well as excursionists, tourists and other guests.

Establishments specialized primarily in the consumption of beer (beer bars) are called &quot;výčep&quot; (&quot;výčap&quot; in Slovak), expressively &quot;nálevna&quot;, or &quot;pajzl&quot; (from German Baisel, originally from Jidish). &quot;Knajpa&quot; (from German) is an expressive word, and &quot;krčma&quot; is rather archaic in Czech. The word &quot;taverna&quot; (from Italian) is understood as a foreign term for establishment from South-European cultures, especially Greek or Italian.

In Moravia, especially South Moravia, this social role is rather fulfilled by &quot;wine cellars&quot;.

Slovak language prefers the word &quot;krčma&quot; as a neutral colloquial term for pubs and restaurants. It is an old panslavic word.

<text>A bar, also known as a saloon, a tavern or tippling house, or sometimes as a pub or club, is a retail business that serves alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, liquor, cocktails, and other beverages such as mineral water and soft drinks. Bars often also sell snack foods, such as chips (crisps) or peanuts, for consumption on their premises. Some types of bars, such as pubs, may also serve food from a restaurant menu. The term &quot;bar&quot; refers both to the countertop where drinks are prepared and served and also by extension to the entirety of the establishment in which the bar is located.

The term derives from the metal or wooden bar (barrier) that is often located along the length of the &quot;bar&quot;. Over many years, heights of bars were lowered, and high stools added, and the brass bar remains today.

==History==
There have been many different names for public drinking spaces throughout history. In the colonial era of the United States, taverns were an important meeting place, as most other institutions were weak. During the 19th century saloons were very important to the leisure time of the working class. Today, even when an establishment uses a different name, such as &quot;tavern&quot; or &quot;saloon&quot; or, in the United Kingdom, a &quot;pub&quot;, the area of the establishment where the bartender pours or mixes beverages is normally called &quot;the bar&quot;.

The sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages was prohibited in the first half of the 20th century in several countries. In the United States, illegal bars during Prohibition were called &quot;speakeasies&quot;, &quot;blind pigs&quot;, and &quot;blind tigers&quot;.

==Legal restrictions==
Laws in many U.S. states prohibit minors from entering a bar, such as California. In the UK, minors are permitted to be in a bar, though there are many bars that also serve food. In many jurisdictions, if those under legal drinking age are allowed to enter, as is the case with pubs that serve food, they are not allowed to drink; in the U.S., there are 8 states where children may drink in a pub if accompanied by their parents. In some jurisdictions, bars cannot serve a patron who is already intoxicated. Cities and towns usually have legal restrictions on where bars may be located and on the types of alcohol they may serve to their customers. Some bars may have a license to serve beer and wine, but not hard liquor. In some jurisdictions, patrons buying alcohol must also order food. In some jurisdictions, bar owners have a legal liability for the conduct of patrons who they serve (this liability may arise in cases of driving under the influence which cause injuries or deaths).

Many Islamic countries prohibit bars as well as the possession or sale of alcohol for religious reasons, while others, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, allow bars in some specific areas, but only permit non-Muslims to drink in them.

==Types==

A bar&#x27;s owners and managers choose the bar&#x27;s name, décor, drink menu, lighting, and other elements which they think will attract a certain kind of patron. However, they have only limited influence over who patronizes their establishment. Thus, a bar originally intended for one demographic profile can become popular with another. For example, a gay or lesbian bar with a dance or disco floor might, over time, attract an increasingly heterosexual clientele, or a blues bar may become a biker bar if most its patrons are bikers. Bars can also be an integral part of larger venues. For example, hotels, casinos and nightclubs are usually home to one or several bars. Other types of bar include:

* A cocktail lounge is an upscale bar that is typically located within a hotel, restaurant or airport.
* A full bar serves liquor, cocktails, wine, and beer.
* A wine bar is a bar that focuses on wine rather than on beer or liquor. Patrons of these bars may taste wines before deciding to buy them. Some wine bars also serve small plates of food or other snacks.
* A beer bar focuses on beer, particularly craft beer, rather than on wine or liquor. A brew pub has an on-site brewery and serves craft beers.
* &quot;Fern bar&quot; is an American slang term for an upscale or preppy (or yuppie) bar.
* A music bar is a bar that presents live music as an attraction, such as a piano bar.
* A dive bar, often referred to simply as a &quot;dive&quot;, is a very informal bar which may be considered by some to be disreputable.
* A non-alcoholic bar is a bar that does not serve alcoholic beverages.
* A strip club is a bar with nude entertainers.
* A bar and grill is also a restaurant.

Some persons may designate either a room or an area of a room as a home bar. Arrangements can vary from being simple, with bottles of alcohol, cups, and perhaps basic bar supplies, to full bars.

===Entertainment===
Bars categorized by the kind of entertainment they offer:
* Arcade bars, in which the bar have video games on cabinets and consoles
* Blues bars, specializing in the live blues style of music
* Comedy bars, specializing in stand-up comedy entertainment
* Dance bars, which have a dance floor where patrons dance to recorded music. Typically, if a venue has a large dance floor, focuses primarily on dancing rather than seated drinking, and hires professional DJs, it is considered to be a nightclub or discothèque rather than a bar.
* Karaoke bars, with nightly karaoke as entertainment
* Music bars, specializing in live music (i.e. concerts). Piano bars are one example.
* Drag bars, which specialize in drag performances as entertainment
* Salsa bars, where patrons dance to Latin salsa music
* Sports bars, which are furnished with sports-related memorabilia and theming, and typically contain a large number of televisions used to broadcast major sporting events for their patrons.
* A tiki bar offers a fully immersive and entertaining environment, including tropical cocktails, tiki carvings, exotica music, a dark, windowless space with light fixtures lending a soft glow, and nautical brick-a-brac that hints at romantic travels to exotic lands.
* Topless bars, where topless female employees dance or serve drinks. In India, these bars are called dance bars, which is distinct from the type of &quot;dance bar&quot; discussed above.

==Bar (counter)==

The counter at which drinks are served by a bartender is called &quot;the bar&quot;. This term is applied, as a synecdoche, to drinking establishments called &quot;bars&quot;. This counter typically stores a variety of beers, wines, liquors, and non-alcoholic ingredients, and is organized to facilitate the bartender&#x27;s work.

Counters for serving other types of food and drink may also be called bars. Examples of this usage of the word include snack bars, sushi bars, juice bars, salad bars, dairy bars, and ice cream sundae bars.

==Gallery==
==In fiction==
Bars are a popular setting for fictional works, and in many cases, authors and other creators have developed imaginary bar locations that have become notable, such as the bar for &quot;Cheers&quot;, Cocktails and Dreams bar in the film &quot;Cocktail&quot; (1988), the Copacabana bar in the crime film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, the rough and tumble Double Deuce in &quot;Road House&quot; (1989), The Kit Kat Klub in &quot;Cabaret&quot;, the Korova Milk Bar in the dystopian novel and film adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, the Mos Eisley cantina-bar in &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; (1977), and the Steinway Beer Garden from the crime-themed video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;.

<doc id="272214" wikidata="Q1591470" url="?curid=272214" title="United States Secretary of the Army">
<text>The secretary of the Army (SA or SECARMY) is a senior civilian official within the United States Department of Defense, with statutory responsibility for all matters relating to the United States Army: manpower, personnel, reserve affairs, installations, environmental issues, weapons systems and equipment acquisition, communications and financial management.

The secretary of the Army is nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. The secretary is a non-Cabinet-level official, subordinate to the secretary of defense. This position was created on September 18, 1947, replacing the secretary of war, when the Department of War was split into the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force.

On February 25, 2025, Daniel Driscoll was confirmed as the secretary of the Army, and was sworn in to office later that day.

== Roles and responsibilities ==
The Army senior leadership consists of two civilians; the secretary of the Army and the under secretary of the Army—and two military officers of four-star rank—the chief of staff of the United States Army and the vice chief of staff.

The secretary of the Army () is in effect the chief executive officer of the Department of the Army, and the chief of staff of the Army works directly for the secretary. The secretary presents and justifies Army policies, plans, programs, and budgets to the secretary of defense, other executive branch officials, and to the congressional Defense Committees. The secretary also communicates Army policies, plans, programs, capabilities, and accomplishments to the public. As necessary, the secretary convenes meetings with the senior leadership of the Army to debate issues, provide direction, and seek advice. The secretary is a member of the Defense Acquisition Board.

The secretary of the Army has several responsibilities under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including the authority to convene general courts-martial.

==Office of the Secretary of the Army==
The Office of the Secretary of the Army is composed of the under secretary of the Army, the assistant secretaries of the Army, the administrative assistant to the secretary, the general counsel of the Department of the Army, the inspector general of the Army, the chief of legislation, and the Army Reserve Forces Policy Committee. Other offices may be established by law or by the secretary of the Army. No more than 1,900 Army officers on the active-duty list may be assigned or detailed to permanent duty in the Office of the Secretary of the Army and on the Army staff.
* Under Secretary of the Army
** Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology)
** Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works)
** Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller)
** Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy and Environment)
** Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)
** General Counsel of the Army
** Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army
** Inspector General of the Army

Each civilian has a military counterpart, as shown in the diagram below. Thus, for example, the Army G-1 has a defined responsibility to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs), the ASA (M&amp;RA).


==Chronological list of secretaries of the Army==
Kenneth Claiborne Royall, the last secretary of war, became the first secretary of the Army when the National Defense Act of 1947 took effect. Gordon Gray was the last Army secretary to hold the Cabinet status, which was henceforth assigned to the secretary of defense.

Prior military service is not a requirement, but several have served in the United States armed forces. Secretary Stone (1989-1993) is the only holder to serve in the military outside of the United States.

<text>The Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services (DARS) was a Texas state agency that was part of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The agency worked with Texans with disabilities and children with developmental delays to improve the quality of their lives and to enable their full participation in society.

The agency was headquartered at 4800 North Lamar Boulevard in Austin.

Former Sub-agencies:
*Division for Rehabilitation Services (DRS) provides programs to help people with disabilities prepare for, find, and maintain employment. 
*Office for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (DHHS) works in partnership with people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing to eliminate societal and communication barriers. 
*Division for Blind Services (DBS) assists blind or visually impaired individuals and their families. 
*Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services, a statewide program for families with children ages three or younger with disabilities and developmental delays.
*Division for Disability Determination Services (DDS), funded entirely through the Social Security Administration (SSA), makes disability determinations for Texans with severe disabilities who apply for Social Security Disability Insurance and/or Supplemental Security Income.

As of September 1, 2016, DARS was dissolved by an act of the sunset commission. The Sunset Commission periodically reviews the performance of State/public agencies and institutions, recommending revisions—and terminations.
The Texas Workforce Commission assumed the following programs
*Vocational Rehabilitation Services

<text>Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB; Japanese: , &quot;Tōgō dejitaru hōsō sābisu&quot;) is a Japanese broadcasting standard for digital television (DTV) and digital radio.

ISDB supersedes both the NTSC-J analog television system and the previously used MUSE Hi-vision analog HDTV system in Japan. An improved version of ISDB-T (ISDB-T International) will soon replace the NTSC, PAL-M, and PAL-N broadcast standards in South America and the Philippines. Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting (DTTB) services using ISDB-T started in Japan in December 2003, and since then, many countries have adopted ISDB over other digital broadcasting standards.

A newer and &quot;advanced&quot; version of the ISDB standard (that will eventually allow up to 8K terrestrial broadcasts and 1080p mobile broadcasts via the VVC codec, including HDR and HFR) is currently under development.

==Introduction==
ISDB is maintained by the Japanese organization ARIB. The standards can be obtained for free at the Japanese organization DiBEG website and at ARIB.

The core standards of ISDB are ISDB-S (satellite television), ISDB-T (terrestrial), ISDB-C (cable) and 2.6 GHz band mobile broadcasting which are all based on MPEG-2, MPEG-4, or HEVC standard for multiplexing with transport stream structure and video and audio coding (MPEG-2, H.264, or HEVC) and are capable of UHD, high-definition television (HDTV) and standard-definition television. ISDB-T and ISDB-Tsb are for mobile reception in TV bands. 1seg is the name of an ISDB-T component that allows viewers to watch TV channels via cell phones, laptop computers, and vehicles.

The concept was named for its similarity to ISDN as both allow multiple channels of data to be transmitted together (a process called multiplexing). This broadcast standard is also much like another digital radio system, Eureka 147, which calls each group of stations on a transmitter an ensemble; this is very much like the multi-channel digital TV standard DVB-T. ISDB-T operates on unused TV channels, an approach that was taken by other countries for TV but never before for radio.

===Transmission===
The various flavors of ISDB differ mainly in the modulations used, due to the requirements of different frequency bands. The 12 GHz band ISDB-S uses PSK modulation, 2.6 GHz band digital sound broadcasting uses CDM, and ISDB-T (in VHF and/or UHF band) uses COFDM with PSK/QAM.

===Interaction===
Besides audio and video transmission, ISDB also defines data connections (Data broadcasting) with the internet as a return channel over several media (10/100 Ethernet, telephone line modem, mobile phone, wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11), etc.) and with different protocols. This component is used, for example, for interactive interfaces like data broadcasting (ARIB STD-B24) and electronic program guides (EPG).

===Interfaces and Encryption===
The ISDB specification describes a lot of (network) interfaces, but most importantly, the Common Interface for Conditional Access System (CAS). While ISDB has examples of implementing various kinds of CAS systems, in Japan, a CAS system called &quot;B-CAS&quot; is used. ARIB STD-B25 defines the Common Scrambling Algorithm (CSA) system called MULTI2 required for (de-)scrambling television.

The ISDB CAS system in Japan is operated by a company named &quot;B-CAS&quot;; the CAS card is called &quot;B-CAS card&quot;. The Japanese ISDB signal is always encrypted by the B-CAS system even if it is a free television program. That is why it is commonly called &quot;Pay per view system without charge&quot;. An interface for mobile reception is under consideration.

ISDB supports RMP (Rights management and protection). Since all digital television (DTV) systems carry digital data content, a DVD or high-definition (HD) recorder could easily copy content losslessly.
US major film studios requested copy protection; this was the main reason for RMP being mandated. The content has three modes: &quot;copy once&quot;, &quot;copy free&quot; and &quot;copy never&quot;. In &quot;copy once&quot; mode, a program can be stored on a hard disk recorder, but cannot be further copied; only moved to another copy-protected media—and this move operation will mark the content &quot;copy one generation&quot;, which is mandated to prevent further copying permanently. &quot;Copy never&quot; programs may only be timeshifted and cannot be permanently stored. In 2006, the Japanese government is evaluating using the Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) &quot;Encryption plus Non-Assertion&quot; mechanism to allow making multiple copies of digital content between compliant devices.

==Receiver==
There are two types of ISDB receiver: Television and set-top box. The aspect ratio of an ISDB-receiving television set is 16:9; televisions fulfilling these specs are called &quot;Hi-Vision TV&quot;. There are four TV types: Cathode-ray tube (CRT), plasma display panel (PDP), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and liquid crystal display (LCD), with LCD being the most popular &quot;Hi-Vision TV&quot; on the Japanese market nowadays.

The LCD share, as measured by JEITA in November 2004, was about 60%. While PDP sets occupy the high-end market with units that are over 50 inches (1270 mm), PDP and CRT set shares are about 20% each. CRT sets are considered low end for Hi-Vision. An STB is sometimes referred to as a digital tuner.

Typical middle to high-end ISDB receivers marketed in Japan have several interfaces:

* F connectors for RF input.
* HDMI or D4 connector for an HDTV monitor in a home cinema.
* Optical digital audio interface for an audio amplifier and speakers for 5.1 surround audio in a home cinema.
* IEEE 1394 (aka FireWire) interface for digital data recorders (like DVD recorders) in a home cinema.
* RCA video jack provides SDTV signal that is sampled down from the HDTV signal for analog CRT television sets or VCRs.
* RCA audio jacks provide stereo audio for analog CRT television sets or VCRs.
* S video is for VCRs or analog CRT television sets.
* 10/100 and modular jack telephone line modem interfaces are for an internet connection.
* B-CAS card interface to de-scramble.
* IR interface jack for controlling a VHS or DVD player.

==Services==
A typical Japanese broadcast service consists as follows:
# One HDTV or up to three SDTV services within one channel.
# Provides interactive television through datacasting.
# Interactive services such as games or shopping, via telephone line or broadband internet.
# Equipped with an electronic program guide.
# Ability to send firmware patches for the TV/tuner over the air.
# During emergencies, the service utilizes Emergency Warning Broadcast system to quickly inform the public of various threats for the areas at risk.

There are examples providing more than 10 SDTV services with H.264 coding in some countries.

==ISDB-S==

===History===
Japan started digital broadcasting using the DVB-S standard by PerfecTV in October/1996, and DirecTV in December/1997, with communication satellites. Still, DVB-S did not satisfy the requirements of Japanese broadcasters, such as NHK, key commercial broadcasting stations like Nippon Television, TBS, Fuji Television, TV Asahi, TV Tokyo, and WOWOW (Movie-only Pay-TV broadcasting). Consequently, ARIB developed a new broadcast standard called ISDB-S. The requirements were HDTV capability, interactive services, network access and effective frequency utilization, and other technical requirements. The DVB-S standard allows the transmission of a bitstream of roughly 34 Mbit/s with a satellite transponder, which means the transponder can send one HDTV channel. Unfortunately, the NHK broadcasting satellite had only four vacant transponders, which led ARIB and NHK to work on ISDB-S: the new standard could transmit at 51 Mbit/s with a single transponder, which means that ISDB-S is 1.5 times more efficient than DVB-S and that one transponder can transmit two HDTV channels, along with other independent audio and data. Digital satellite broadcasting (BS digital) was started by NHK and followed commercial broadcasting stations on 1 December 2000. Today, SKY PerfecTV! (the successor of Skyport TV and Sky D), CS burn, Platone, EP, DirecTV, J Sky B, and PerfecTV!, adopted the ISDB-S system for use on the 110-degree (east longitude) wide-band communication satellite.

===ISDB-S3===
ISDB-S3 is a satellite digital broadcasting specification supporting 4K, 8K, HDR, HFR, and 22.2 audio.

==ISDB-C==
ISDB-C is a cable digital broadcasting specification. The technical specification J.83/C is developed by JCTEA. ISDB-C is identical to DVB-C but has a different channel bandwidth of 6 MHz (instead of 8 MHz) and roll-off factor.

==ISDB-T==

===History===
HDTV was invented at NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories (Japan Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Science &amp; Technical Research Laboratories). The research for HDTV started as early as the 1960s, though a standard was proposed to the ITU-R (CCIR) only in 1973.

By the 1980s, a high definition television camera, cathode-ray tube, videotape recorder, and editing equipment, among others, had been developed. In 1982 NHK developed MUSE (Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding), the first HDTV video compression and transmission system. MUSE used digital video compression, but for transmission frequency modulation was used after a digital-to-analog converter converted the digital signal.

In 1987, NHK demonstrated MUSE in Washington D.C. as well as NAB. The demonstration made a great impression in the U.S., leading to the development of the ATSC terrestrial DTV system. Europe also developed a DTV system called DVB. Japan began R&amp;D of a completely digital system in the 1980s that led to ISDB. Japan began terrestrial digital broadcasting, using ISDB-T standard by NHK and commercial broadcasting stations, on 1 December 2003.

===Features===
ISDB-T is characterized by the following features:

* ISDB-T (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial) in Japan use UHF 470 MHz-710 MHz, bandwidth of 240 MHz, allocate 40 channels namely channels 13 to 52 (previously used also 710 MHz-770 MHz, 53 to 62, but this range was re-assigned to cell phones), each channel is 6 MHz width (actually 5.572 MHz effective bandwidth and 430 kHz guard band between channels). These channels are called &quot;physical channel(物理チャンネル)&quot;. For other countries, US channel table or European channel table are used.
* For channel tables with 6 MHz width, ISDB-T single channel bandwidths 5.572 MHz has number of carriers 5,617 with interval of 0.99206 kHz. For 7 MHz channel, channel bandwidth is 6.50 MHz; for 8 MHz 7.42 MHz.
* ISDB-T allows to accommodate any combination of HDTV (roughly 8 Mbit/s in H.264) and SDTV (roughly 2 Mbit/s in H.264) within the given bitrate determined by the transmission parameters such as bandwidth, code-rate, guard interval, etc. Typically, among the 13 segments, the center segment is used for 1seg with QPSK modulation and the remaining 12 segments for the HDTV or SDTV payloads for 64QAM modulation. The bitstream of the 12 segments are combined into one transport stream, within which any combination of programs can be carried based on the MPEG-2 transport stream definition.
* ISDB-T transmits an HDTV channel and a mobile TV channel 1seg within one channel. 1seg is a mobile terrestrial digital audio/video broadcasting service in Japan. Although 1seg is designed for mobile usage, reception is sometimes problematic in moving vehicles. Because of reception on high speed vehicle, UHF transmission is shaded by buildings and hills frequently, but reported well receiving in Shinkansen as far as run in flat or rural area.
* ISDB-T provides interactive services with data broadcasting. Such as Electronic Program Guides. ISDB-T supports internet access as a return channel that works to support the data broadcasting. Internet access is also provided on mobile phones.
* ISDB-T provides Single-Frequency Network (SFN) and on-channel repeater technology. SFN makes efficient utilization of the frequency resource (spectrum). For example, the Kanto area (greater Tokyo area including most part of Tokyo prefecture and some part of Chiba, Ibaragi, Tochigi, Saitama and Kanagawa prefecture) are covered with SFN with roughly 10 million population coverage.
* ISDB-T can be received indoors with a simple indoor antenna.
* ISDB-T provides robustness to multipath interference (&quot;ghosting&quot;), co-channel analog television interference, and electromagnetic interferences that come from motor vehicles and power lines in urban environments.
* ISDB-T is claimed to allow HDTV to be received on moving vehicles at over 100 km/h; DVB-T can only receive SDTV on moving vehicles, and it is claimed that ATSC can not be received on moving vehicles at all (however, in early 2007 there were reports of successful reception of ATSC on laptops using USB tuners in moving vehicles).

===Adoption===
ISDB-T was adopted for commercial transmissions in Japan in December 2003. It currently comprises a market of about 100 million television sets. ISDB-T had 10 million subscribers by the end of April 2005. Along with the wide use of ISDB-T, the price of receivers is getting low. The price of ISDB-T STB in the lower end of the market is ¥19800 as of 19 April 2006. By November 2007 only a few older, low-end STB models could be found in the Japanese market (average price U$180), showing a tendency towards replacement by mid to high-end equipment like PVRs and TV sets with inbuilt tuners. In November 2009, a retail chain AEON introduced STB in 40 USD, followed by variety of low-cost tuners. The Dibeg web page confirms this tendency by showing low significance of the digital tuner STB market in Japan.

Brazil, which used an analogue TV system (PAL-M) that slightly differed from any other countries, has chosen ISDB-T as a base for its DTV format, calling it ISDB-Tb or &quot;internally&quot; SBTVD (&quot;Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão Digital-Terrestre&quot;). The Japanese DiBEG group incorporated the advancements made by Brazil -MPEG4 video codec instead of ISDB-T&#x27;s MPEG2 and a powerful interaction middleware called Ginga- and has renamed the standard to &quot;ISDB-T International&quot;. Other than Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Chile and Ecuador which have selected ISDB-Tb, there are other South American countries, mainly from Mercosur, such as Venezuela, that chose ISDB-Tb, which providing economies of scale and common market benefits from the regional South American manufacturing instead of importing ready-made STBs as is the case with the other standards. Also, it has been confirmed with extensive tests realized by Brazilian Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (ABERT), Brazilian Television Engineering Society (SET) and Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie the insufficient quality for indoor reception presented by ATSC and, between DVB-T and ISDB-T, the latter presented superior performance in indoor reception and flexibility to access digital services and TV programs through non-mobile, mobile or portable receivers with impressive quality.

The ABERT–SET group in Brazil did system comparison tests of DTV under the supervision of the CPqD foundation. The comparison tests were done under the direction of a work group of SET and ABERT. The ABERT/SET group selected ISDB-T as the best choice in digital broadcasting modulation systems among ATSC, DVB-T and ISDB-T. Another study found that ISDB-T and DVB-T performed similarly, and that both were outperformed by DVB-T2.

ISDB-T was singled out as the most flexible of all for meeting the needs of mobility and portability. It is most efficient for mobile and portable reception. On June 29, 2006, Brazil announced ISDB-T-based SBTVD as the chosen standard for digital TV transmissions, to be fully implemented by 2016. By November 2007 (one month prior DTTV launch), a few suppliers started to announce zapper STBs of the new Nippon-Brazilian SBTVD-T standard, at that time without interactivity.

As in 2019, the implementation rollout in Brazil proceeded successfully, with terrestrial analog services (PAL-M) phased out in most of the country (for some less populated regions, analog signal shutdown was postponed to 2023).

====Adoption by country====
This lists the other countries who adopted the ISDB-T standard, chronologically arranged.

* On January 23, 2017, El Salvador adopted the ISDB-T standard.
* On March 20, 2019, Angola adopted the ISDB-T standard.

===Technical specification===
 Segment structure 

ARIB has developed a segment structure called BST-OFDM (see figure).
ISDB-T divides the frequency band of one channel into thirteen segments. The broadcaster can select which combination of segments to use; this choice of segment structure allows for service flexibility. For example, ISDB-T can transmit both LDTV and HDTV using one TV channel or change to 3 SDTV, a switch that can be performed at any time. ISDB-T can also change the modulation scheme at the same time.

The above figure shows the spectrum of 13 segments structure of ISDB-T.
(&quot;s0&quot; is generally used for 1seg, &quot;s1&quot;-&quot;s12&quot; are used for one HDTV or three SDTVs)

====Summary of ISDB-T====
* H.264 Baseline profile is used in one segment (1seg) broadcasting for portables and Mobile phone.
* H.264 High-profile is used in ISDB-Tb to high definition broadcasts.

ISDB-Tsb is the terrestrial digital sound broadcasting specification. The technical specification is the same as ISDB-T. ISDB-Tsb supports the coded transmission of OFDM signals.

===ISDB-Tmm===
ISDB-Tmm (Terrestrial mobile multi-media) utilised suitable number of segments by station with video coding MPEG-4 AVC/H.264. With multiple channels, ISDB-Tmm served dedicated channels such as sport, movie, music channels and others with CD quality sound, allowing for better broadcast quality as compared to 1seg. This service used the VHF band, 207.5–222 MHz which began to be utilised after Japan&#x27;s switchover to digital television in July 2011.

Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications licensed to NTT Docomo subsidiary &quot;mmbi, Inc.&quot; for ISDB-Tmm method on September 9, 2010. The MediaFLO method offered with KDDI was not licensed.

The ISDB-Tmm broadcasting service by &quot;mmbi, Inc.&quot; is named モバキャス (pronounced &quot;mobakyasu&quot;), literally short form of mobile casting on July 14, 2011, and had been branded as NOTTV since October 4, 2011. The Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications approved the start of operations of &quot;NOTTV&quot; on October 13, 2011. Planning the service with monthly subscription fee of 420 yen for south Kanto Plain, Aichi, Osaka, Kyoto and some other prefectures from April 1, 2012. The deployment plan was to cover approximately 73% of households by the end of 2012, approximately 91% by the end of 2014, and 125 stations or repeaters to be installed in 2016 to cover cities nationwide. Android smartphones and tablets with ISDB-Tmm receiving capability were also sold mainly by NTT DoCoMo, although a separate tuner (TV BoX manufactured by Huawei; or StationTV manufactured by Pixela) could be purchased for iPhones and iPads as well as Android smartphones and tablets sold by au by KDDI and SoftBank Mobile to receive ISDB-Tmm broadcasts.

Due to the continued unprofitability of NOTTV, &quot;mmbi, Inc.&quot; shut down the service on June 30, 2016.

<doc id="272241" wikidata="Q2089560" url="?curid=272241" title="The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents">
<text>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents is a children&#x27;s fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, published by Doubleday in 2001. It is the twenty-eighth novel in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series and the first written for children. The story is a new take on the German fairy tale about the Pied Piper of Hamelin and a parody of the folk tale genre.

Pratchett won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book published in the U.K. It was his first major award.

== Series ==
&quot;Discworld&quot; had been a comic fantasy series for adults, beginning with &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; in 1983. &quot;Amazing Maurice&quot; was marketed as a children&#x27;s book, to be followed in that respect by &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; (2003, #30). It differs from earlier Discworld novels also by its division into chapters, though chapters become far more common in later books of the series. Contrary to the contrast between adult and child markets, reflected in catalogues, &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed on the occasion of the Carnegie Medal that &quot;[t]he main audience for Pratchett&#x27;s 48 books, all busily in print, is teenagers, who are drawn by his irrepressible invention and sense of mischief.&quot;

Maurice and his educated rodents were previously mentioned in the eleventh Discworld novel, &quot;Reaper Man&quot; (1991), although the characters in that novel are aware of the fraud perpetrated by Maurice and the rats.
==Plot summary==
The book opens with Amazing Maurice (a sentient cat), a group of talking rats (the Clan), and the human boy Keith travelling in a mail coach to a small town called Bad Blintz. The group plans to enact a scheme they have used many times before, where in the rats pretend to infest the town and Keith poses as a rat piper to lead the &quot;vermin&quot; away for a small sum of cash. Although Maurice sees nothing wrong with this hustling business, the rats find it immoral, and convince Maurice that this town will be the last one they rob. Upon arriving in town, the group discovers that the people are convinced of a massive rat infestation, and have spent much of their savings on two rat catchers. Despite their efforts, food continues to disappear from the town. As the rats move into the town&#x27;s underground, they discover an overwhelmingly large number of rat traps, but no live &quot;keekees&quot; (rats who cannot talk or think). Aboveground, Maurice makes similar observations, including that many of the rat tails the rat catchers display as proof of their successful hunting are in fact shoelaces. Maurice and Keith meet the mayor&#x27;s daughter Malicia and introduce her to the talking rats.

Malicia believes that the rat catchers are up to something and so she, Maurice, and Keith break into the rat catchers&#x27; hut. They discover a great deal of food stolen by the men and large cages where the local &quot;keekees&quot; are being bred for coursing. The rat catchers return and lock up the humans, taking away the rat leader Hamnpork who had met up with them. Maurice hides and feels a voice trying to enter his mind, inciting a great sense of fear. The rats of the Clan feel it too, and many become so afraid that they all but forget how to think and reason. Dangerous Beans, the rats&#x27; spiritual leader, is crushed by the realization that the rats are just mindless animals at heart, and leaves with his assistant Peaches. Darktan, the rats&#x27; trap expert, leads a group to rescue Hamnpork, and succeeds after nearly dying in a trap. Hamnpork dies of injuries sustained while fighting in the rat coursing pit, and Darktan reluctantly assumes leadership of the Clan.

Malicia and Keith, after freeing themselves, trick the rat catchers into admitting their crimes. The rat catchers have created a powerful rat king named Spider, which is the source of the mysterious voice that has been plaguing the rats and Maurice. Using its mental control over the rat catchers, Spider plans to wage war on the humans that created it. It sends the rats it controls to attack Maurice, Peaches, and Dangerous Beans. However, Maurice (so terrified that he stops thinking and acts instinctively) pounces on the rat king and destroys it. In his panic, Maurice also unwittingly kills Dangerous Beans. Maurice emerges from Spider&#x27;s chamber carrying the body of Dangerous Beans. When he is safely out, he collapses and dies. In ghostly form, he sees the Death of Rats coming for Dangerous Beans and makes a deal with Death: two of his remaining lives in exchange for both his life and the albino rat&#x27;s.

The rats corral all the &quot;keekees&quot; and block their ears. When a &quot;real&quot; rat piper arrives in town, Keith challenges him to a duel. The piper plays his magic rat pipe but none of the rats come out. Keith plays on a trombone and Sardines (an intelligent rat) emerges and dances for the crowd. Keith is proclaimed the winner, and leads the &quot;keekees&quot; out of town with the piper. After the piper leaves, the Clan rats emerge from hiding and tell the humans about the rat catchers&#x27; duplicity. The humans bargain with the rats: if the Clan will keep the &quot;keekees&quot; out of the town, the rats may stay and live as though they were just smaller humans. Keith decides to stay behind as Bad Blintz&#x27;s ceremonial rat piper, while Maurice moves on to find a new scheme.

===Characters===
* Maurice – an intelligent cat who leads the group of rats. He is cunning and manipulative and has a very good (but cynical) understanding of how the world works. Late in the novel, he guiltily admits that he accidentally ate one of the intelligent rats of the Clan early in their history, and thus became sentient himself.
* Malicia – the daughter of Bad Blintz&#x27;s mayor, perennially obsessed with fairy tales, having adventures, and storytelling.
* Keith – called the &quot;stupid-looking kid&quot;, Keith is an orphan raised by the Musician&#x27;s Guild. He goes along with Maurice&#x27;s scheme mainly to have something to do, although he is very defensive of his rat family.
* Dangerous Beans – an albino rat who has acted as a kind of spiritual leader for the Clan since they became intelligent after eating rubbish from behind Unseen University. Darktan observes that Dangerous Beans is the Clan&#x27;s much-needed philosopher, finding and &quot;disarming&quot; dangerous ideas for the group. For example, Dangerous Beans is the one who they all turn to for answers to questions of rat cannibalism, stealing, and the phenomenon of dreaming. He is also the interpreter of the rats&#x27; &quot;bible&quot;, a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Mr. Bunnsy Has An Adventure&quot;, which depicts rats and other animals living in harmony with humans, speaking and dressing like them. When Malicia observes that this book&#x27;s utopian society is entirely fictional, Dangerous Beans and his assistant Peaches run off in despair.
* Peaches – a small female rat who acts as Dangerous Beans&#x27; assistant and the Clan&#x27;s scribe. She is the unofficial carrier (dragger would be the more appropriate term) of the Thoughts, and &quot;Mr. Bunnsy Has An Adventure&quot;.
* Hamnpork – the aging leader of the Clan, leftover from before they could think. Hamnpork resists the idea of &quot;thinking&quot; and leads the Clan through the brute force and cunning that traditional &quot;keekees&quot; leaders use.
* Darktan – the leader of the rats&#x27; Trap Disposal Squad. After his near-death experience and the death of Hamnpork, Darktan becomes the Clan&#x27;s new leader. Darktan, although an older rat, is much more progressive than Hamnpork. He is well-respected by all the rats because his knowledge of how to disarm traps helps keep them alive.
* Sardines – an older rat who wears a hat and tap dances. Sardines epitomizes the group of rats who harass the humans into thinking they have a full-blown infestation. He does not seek to lead but provides insightful help to Darktan after the latter becomes the leader of the Clan. He understands how to read both humans and rats and can manipulate both (but much more kindly than Maurice).

== Recognition ==
Karen Usher, who chaired the panel of Carnegie judges, declared that the selection was unanimous: &quot;This is an outstanding work of literary excellencea brilliant twist on the tale of the Pied Piper that is funny and irreverent, but also dark and subversive.&quot;

The Carnegie Medal for &quot;Maurice&quot; was Pratchett&#x27;s first major award. &quot;The Guardian&quot; alluded to &quot;16 years of disdain by the British literary establishment&quot; and reported about his acceptance speech that he &quot;rounded on&quot; that establishment, &quot;tilted at&quot; Tolkien, and showed ambivalence about the fantasy label: &quot;though his work dealt with profound themes, &#x27;stick in one lousy dragon and they call you a fantasy writer&#x27;.&quot;
==Ideas and themes==

All the rats&#x27; names derive from the words they have seen written on tins before they knew what the words meant, and they have called themselves whatever they thought sounded interesting. Pratchett puns on this, such as the doubting rat, who was called &quot;Tomato&quot; (as in Doubting Thomas).

==Adaptations==
* BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute dramatisation on 23 August 2003, which was repeated on BBC 7 on 2 June 2007 and 27 April 2008. The character of Dangerous Beans was voiced by David Tennant. Darktan&#x27;s voice was a spoof version of Sean Connery&#x27;s Scottish burr. The narrator in the adaptation was Maurice himself, describing to Dangerous Beans how they arrived at the perilous situation near the end of the plot. Quotes from &quot;Mr. Bunnsy Has an Adventure&quot;, which appear as chapter heads in the book, were read by Rebecca Norfolk, aged 8, who played &quot;Child reader&quot; in the BBC Radio 4 production. To mark the occasion of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s knighthood, it was broadcast on BBC 7 again, along with other dramatizations of his work, in February 2009.4

* The book has been adapted for the stage twice: first by Stephen Briggs in 2003 and published by Oxford Playscripts, then in 2011 as a musical by Matthew Holmes, published by Collins Musicals. Both versions are designed for use in schools.

* In June 2019, a UK-Germany co-production between Ulysses Filmproduktion and Cantilever Media announced a CGI-animated full-length feature film adaptation, &quot;The Amazing Maurice&quot; with a of budget €15 million ($17 million). Terry Rossio closely adapted a screenplay from novel. The film stars the voices of Hugh Laurie — as the eponymous lead character of the streetwise talking ginger tomcat Maurice, — with Emilia Clarke, Himesh Patel, Gemma Arterton, Ariyon Bakare, David Tennant, Julie Atherton, Joe Sugg, Rob Brydon, Hugh Bonneville, David Thewlis, and Peter Serafinowicz cameoing as Death. The film&#x27;s musical score was composed by Tom Howe with English singer-songwriter Gabrielle Aplin. It had its premiere at the Manchester Animation Festival on 13 November 2022 before going on to general release at the end of 2022. 

* The same film production companies are putting together a CGI-animated feature film sequel to this film due for release in 2027.

<doc id="272290" wikidata="Q194158" url="?curid=272290" title="Bit rate">
<text>In telecommunications and computing, bit rate (bitrate or as a variable &quot;R&quot;) is the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time.

The bit rate is expressed in the unit bit per second (symbol: bit/s), often in conjunction with an SI prefix such as kilo (1 kbit/s = 1,000 bit/s), mega (1 Mbit/s = 1,000 kbit/s), giga (1 Gbit/s = 1,000 Mbit/s) or tera (1 Tbit/s = 1,000 Gbit/s). The non-standard abbreviation bps is often used to replace the standard symbol bit/s, so that, for example, 1 Mbps is used to mean one million bits per second.

In most computing and digital communication environments, one byte per second (symbol: B/s) corresponds to 8 bit/s.

== Prefixes ==
When quantifying large or small bit rates, SI prefixes (also known as metric prefixes or decimal prefixes) are used, thus:
Binary prefixes are sometimes used for bit rates.
The International Standard (IEC 80000-13) specifies different symbols for binary and decimal (SI) prefixes (e.g., 1 KiB/s = 1024 B/s = 8192 bit/s, and 1 MiB/s = 1024 KiB/s).

== In data communications ==

=== Gross bit rate ===
In digital communication systems, the physical layer &quot;gross bitrate&quot;, &quot;raw bitrate&quot;, &quot;data signaling rate&quot;, &quot;gross data transfer rate&quot; or &quot;uncoded transmission rate&quot; (sometimes written as a variable &quot;R&quot;b or &quot;f&quot;b) is the total number of physically transferred bits per second over a communication link, including useful data as well as protocol overhead.

In case of serial communications, the gross bit rate is related to the bit transmission time formula_1
as:
: formula_2

The gross bit rate is related to the symbol rate or modulation rate, which is expressed in bauds or symbols per second. However, the gross bit rate and the baud value are equal &quot;only&quot; when there are only two levels per symbol, representing 0 and 1, meaning that each symbol of a data transmission system carries exactly one bit of data; for example, this is not the case for modern modulation systems used in modems and LAN equipment.

For most line codes and modulation methods:
: formula_3

More specifically, a line code (or baseband transmission scheme) representing the data using pulse-amplitude modulation with formula_4 different voltage levels, can transfer formula_5 bits per pulse. A digital modulation method (or passband transmission scheme) using formula_4 different symbols, for example formula_4 amplitudes, phases or frequencies, can transfer formula_5 bits per symbol. This results in:
: formula_9

An exception from the above is some self-synchronizing line codes, for example Manchester coding and return-to-zero (RTZ) coding, where each bit is represented by two pulses (signal states), resulting in:
: formula_10

A theoretical upper bound for the symbol rate in baud, symbols/s or pulses/s for a certain spectral bandwidth in hertz is given by the Nyquist law:
: formula_11

In practice this upper bound can only be approached for line coding schemes and for so-called vestigial sideband digital modulation. Most other digital carrier-modulated schemes, for example ASK, PSK, QAM and OFDM, can be characterized as double sideband modulation, resulting in the following relation:
: formula_12

In case of parallel communication, the gross bit rate is given by
: formula_13
where &quot;n&quot; is the number of parallel channels, &quot;Mi&quot; is the number of symbols or levels of the modulation in the &quot;i&quot;th channel, and &quot;Ti&quot; is the symbol duration time, expressed in seconds, for the &quot;i&quot;th channel.

=== Information rate ===
The physical layer net bitrate, information rate, useful bit rate, payload rate, net data transfer rate, coded transmission rate, effective data rate or wire speed (informal language) of a digital communication channel is the capacity excluding the physical layer protocol overhead, for example time division multiplex (TDM) framing bits, redundant forward error correction (FEC) codes, equalizer training symbols and other channel coding. Error-correcting codes are common especially in wireless communication systems, broadband modem standards and modern copper-based high-speed LANs. The physical layer net bitrate is the datarate measured at a reference point in the interface between the data link layer and physical layer, and may consequently include data link and higher layer overhead.

In modems and wireless systems, link adaptation (automatic adaptation of the data rate and the modulation and/or error coding scheme to the signal quality) is often applied. In that context, the term peak bitrate denotes the net bitrate of the fastest and least robust transmission mode, used for example when the distance is very short between sender and transmitter. Some operating systems and network equipment may detect the &quot;connection speed&quot; (informal language) of a network access technology or communication device, implying the current net bit rate. The term line rate in some textbooks is defined as gross bit rate, in others as net bit rate.

The relationship between the gross bit rate and net bit rate is affected by the FEC code rate according to the following.
: net bit rate ≤ gross bit rate × code rate

The connection speed of a technology that involves forward error correction typically refers to the physical layer &quot;net bit rate&quot; in accordance with the above definition.

For example, the net bitrate (and thus the &quot;connection speed&quot;) of an IEEE 802.11a wireless network is the net bit rate of between 6 and 54 Mbit/s, while the gross bit rate is between 12 and 72 Mbit/s inclusive of error-correcting codes.

The net bit rate of ISDN2 Basic Rate Interface (2 B-channels + 1 D-channel) of 64+64+16 = 144 kbit/s also refers to the payload data rates, while the D channel signalling rate is 16 kbit/s.

The net bit rate of the Ethernet 100BASE-TX physical layer standard is 100 Mbit/s, while the gross bitrate is 125 Mbit/s, due to the 4B5B (four bit over five bit) encoding. In this case, the gross bit rate is equal to the symbol rate or pulse rate of 125 megabaud, due to the NRZI line code.

In communications technologies without forward error correction and other physical layer protocol overhead, there is no distinction between gross bit rate and physical layer net bit rate. For example, the net as well as gross bit rate of Ethernet 10BASE-T is 10 Mbit/s. Due to the Manchester line code, each bit is represented by two pulses, resulting in a pulse rate of 20 megabaud.

The &quot;connection speed&quot; of a V.92 voiceband modem typically refers to the gross bit rate, since there is no additional error-correction code. It can be up to 56,000 bit/s downstream and 48,000 bit/s upstream. A lower bit rate may be chosen during the connection establishment phase due to adaptive modulationslower but more robust modulation schemes are chosen in case of poor signal-to-noise ratio. Due to data compression, the actual data transmission rate or throughput (see below) may be higher.

The channel capacity, also known as the Shannon capacity, is a theoretical upper bound for the maximum net bitrate, exclusive of forward error correction coding, that is possible without bit errors for a certain physical analog node-to-node communication link.
: net bit rate ≤ channel capacity

The channel capacity is proportional to the analog bandwidth in hertz. This proportionality is called Hartley&#x27;s law. Consequently, the net bit rate is sometimes called digital bandwidth capacity in bit/s.

=== Network throughput ===
The term &quot;throughput&quot;, essentially the same thing as digital bandwidth consumption, denotes the achieved average useful bit rate in a computer network over a logical or physical communication link or through a network node, typically measured at a reference point above the data link layer. This implies that the throughput often excludes data link layer protocol overhead. The throughput is affected by the traffic load from the data source in question, as well as from other sources sharing the same network resources. See also measuring network throughput.

=== Goodput (data transfer rate) ===
&quot;Goodput&quot; or data transfer rate refers to the achieved average net bit rate that is delivered to the application layer, exclusive of all protocol overhead, data packets retransmissions, etc. For example, in the case of file transfer, the goodput corresponds to the achieved file transfer rate. The file transfer rate in bit/s can be calculated as the file size (in bytes) divided by the file transfer time (in seconds) and multiplied by eight.

As an example, the goodput or data transfer rate of a V.92 voiceband modem is affected by the modem physical layer and data link layer protocols. It is sometimes higher than the physical layer data rate due to V.44 data compression, and sometimes lower due to bit-errors and automatic repeat request retransmissions.

If no data compression is provided by the network equipment or protocols, we have the following relation:
: goodput ≤ throughput ≤ maximum throughput ≤ net bit rate
for a certain communication path.

=== Progress trends ===
These are examples of physical layer net bit rates in proposed communication standard interfaces and devices:

== Multimedia ==
In digital multimedia, bit rate represents the amount of information, or detail, that is stored per unit of time of a recording. The bitrate depends on several factors:

* The original material may be sampled at different frequencies.
* The samples may use different numbers of bits.
* The data may be encoded by different schemes.
* The information may be digitally compressed by different algorithms or to different degrees.

Generally, choices are made about the above factors in order to achieve the desired trade-off between minimizing the bitrate and maximizing the quality of the material when it is played.

If lossy data compression is used on audio or visual data, differences from the original signal will be introduced; if the compression is substantial, or lossy data is decompressed and recompressed, this may become noticeable in the form of compression artifacts. Whether these affect the perceived quality, and if so how much, depends on the compression scheme, encoder power, the characteristics of the input data, the listener&#x27;s perceptions, the listener&#x27;s familiarity with artifacts, and the listening or viewing environment.

The encoding bit rate of a multimedia file is its size in bytes divided by the playback time of the recording (in seconds), multiplied by eight.

For real-time streaming multimedia, the encoding bit rate is the goodput that is required to avoid playback interruption.

The term average bitrate is used in case of variable bitrate multimedia source coding schemes. In this context, the &quot;peak bit rate&quot; is the maximum number of bits required for any short-term block of compressed data.

A theoretical lower bound for the encoding bit rate for lossless data compression is the source information rate, also known as the &quot;entropy rate&quot;.

The bitrates in this section are approximately the &quot;minimum&quot; that the &quot;average&quot; listener in a typical listening or viewing environment, when using the best available compression, would perceive as not significantly worse than the reference standard.

=== Audio ===

==== CD-DA ====
Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA) uses 44,100 samples per second, each with a bit depth of 16, a format sometimes abbreviated like &quot;16bit / 44.1kHz&quot;. CD-DA is also stereo, using a left and right channel, so the amount of audio data per second is double that of mono, where only a single channel is used.

The bit rate of PCM audio data can be calculated with the following formula:
: formula_14

For example, the bit rate of a CD-DA recording (44.1 kHz sampling rate, 16 bits per sample and two channels) can be calculated as follows:
: formula_15

The cumulative size of a length of PCM audio data (excluding a file header or other metadata) can be calculated using the following formula:
: formula_16

The cumulative size in bytes can be found by dividing the file size in bits by the number of bits in a byte, which is eight:
: formula_17

Therefore, 80 minutes (4,800 seconds) of CD-DA data requires 846,720,000 bytes of storage:
: formula_18
where MiB is mebibytes with binary prefix Mi, meaning 220 = 1,048,576.

<doc id="272297" wikidata="Q842924" url="?curid=272297" title="Brasstown Bald">
<text>Brasstown Bald is the highest point in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is located in the northeastern part of the state in the Blue Ridge Mountains on the border between Towns and Union counties south of the city of Hiawassee. The mountain is known to the native Cherokee people as Enotah.

==Description==
The name in English is derived from a mistaken translation of the term for the nearby Cherokee village of Brasstown, located along the upper Brasstown Creek (named in English from the same error) feeding the Hiawassee River.

Immediately north of the mountain and across the state line with North Carolina are other places named by English settlers: Brasstown, a community in the Brasstown township of Clay County, North Carolina.

Brasstown Bald encompasses Towns and Union counties with the county line intersecting the peak. The mountain is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains (part of the Appalachian Mountains) and within the borders of the Blue Ridge Ranger District of the Chattahoochee National Forest. The mountain consists mostly of soapstone and dunite.

On a clear day it is possible to see the tallest buildings of Atlanta, some 85 miles away from the summit. The U.S. Forest Service has webcams atop the observation tower and a RAWS weather station further down the mountain. The public can drive to a parking lot from the top via Georgia State Route 180 Spur and then continue to the summit via a shuttle bus or a short hike on a paved trail.

==History==

According to the two Georgia historical markers, the area surrounding Brasstown Bald was settled by the Cherokee people. English-speaking settlers derived the word &quot;Brasstown&quot; from a translation error of the Cherokee word for its village place. Settlers confused the word &quot;Itse&#x27;yĭ&quot; (meaning &quot;New Green Place&quot; or &quot;Place of Fresh Green&quot;), which the Cherokee used for their village, with &quot;Ûňtsaiyĭ&quot; (&quot;brass&quot;), and referred to the settlement as Brasstown. The Cherokee gave the locative name, &quot;Itse&#x27;yĭ&quot;, to several distinct areas in their territory, including an area nearby in what is considered present-day North Carolina.

According to Cherokee legend about &quot;Itse&#x27;yĭ&quot;, a great flood swept over the land. All the people died except a few Cherokee families who sought refuge in a giant canoe. The canoe ran aground at the summit of a forested mountain (now known as Enotah). As there was no wild game for the people to hunt and no place for them to plant crops, the Great Spirit killed all the trees on the top of the mountain so that the surviving people could plant crops. They continued planting and lived from their crops until the water subsided.

Other transliterated spellings of the Cherokee name for the mountain include &quot;Echia,&quot; &quot;Echoee,&quot; &quot;Etchowee&quot;, and &quot;Enotah.&quot;

The term &quot;Bald&quot; is common terminology in the southern Appalachians describing mountaintops that have 360-degree unobstructed views.

Former Georgia Supreme Court Judge Thomas S. Candler is memorialized with a stone monument at Brasstown Bald. It was erected in 1971 three months before he died in recognition of his efforts to support getting more visitors to the mountain and establishing a visitor center there for them.

==Distances to summit==
From the northeast, starting at the intersection of Owl Creek Road and the Unicol Turnpike (concurrent Georgia 17 and Georgia 75) near Mountain Scene, the climb is long, gaining , an average 6.3% grade.

From the southeast, starting at the intersection of Georgia 180 and Georgia 17/75 near Sooky Gap, the climb is long, gaining , an average of 5.8% grade.

From the west, starting at the intersection of Georgia 180 and Richard B. Russell Scenic Highway (Georgia 348) near Choestoe, the climb is , gaining , an average of 6.0% grade.

From the intersection of Route 180 and Route 180 Spur at Jacks Gap the climb is at an average gradient of 11.2%, (height gain: ).

An additional route to the summit is the Wagon Train Trail, starting at Young Harris College. The trail is traditionally hiked by graduating students and their families on the evening before graduation; a vespers service is held at the summit.

== Biodiversity ==
Brasstown Bald is the only known location of the isopod &quot;Ligidium enotahensis&quot;.

==Tour de Georgia==
In the 2005 through 2008 editions of the Tour de Georgia, a long-distance bicycle race, Brasstown Bald was the site of an &quot;hors categorie&quot; &quot;King of the Mountains stage&quot; finish.

==Broadcasting==
NOAA Weather Radio station KXI22 transmits from atop the mountain, simulcasting with KXI75 from Blue Ridge, Georgia. The programming originates from NWSFO Peachtree City.

Georgia Public Broadcasting had or has construction permits from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for two low-power broadcast translator stations at the summit. The digital TV station on channel 12 (W25FP-D, licensed December 2009) is the direct replacement for analog TV station W04BJ in nearby Young Harris, and also covers for W50AB in nearby Hiawassee (both to the north). New station WBTB FM 90.3 will transmit at just 97 watts, equivalent to several hundred watts because of the height above average terrain of over 700 meters, or more than 2,300 feet. Both stations will have Young Harris as the city of license.

<doc id="272299" wikidata="Q779341" url="?curid=272299" title="Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1858)">
<text>Sir Charles Henry Hawtrey (21 September 1858 – 30 July 1923) was an English actor, director, producer and manager. He pursued a successful career as an actor-manager, specialising in debonair, often disreputable, parts in popular comedies. He occasionally played in Sheridan and other classics, but was generally associated with new works by writers including Oscar Wilde and Somerset Maugham.

Born to a long-established county family, Hawtrey was one of three of his parents&#x27; five sons to pursue a theatrical career. Before going on the stage he had considered joining the army, but failed to apply himself to the necessary studies to qualify for a commission. Once established as an actor he quickly took on the additional role of a manager, boosted by an early success with his own adaptation of a German farce presented in London as &quot;The Private Secretary&quot;, which made his fortune. A lifelong gambler, both with theatrical productions and on horseracing, to which he was addicted, he was bankrupted several times during his career.

Regarded as Britain&#x27;s leading comedy actor of his generation, Hawtrey was mentor and role model to younger actors including Noël Coward. Towards the end of his career Hawtrey starred in a handful of silent movies.

==Early life==

Hawtrey was born at Slough and educated at Eton College, the fifth son and eighth of the ten children of the Rev. John William Hawtrey and his first wife, Frances Mary Anne, &quot;née&quot; Procter. The Hawtrey family had a long association with Eton; at the time of Hawtrey&#x27;s birth his father was a housemaster there, and a cousin, Edward Craven Hawtrey, was Provost. At the age of eight Hawtrey entered the lower school of the college. Three years later John Hawtrey left Eton to found St Michael&#x27;s School, Slough; Hawtrey was educated there from 1869 to 1872, when he returned to Eton for a year, before moving to Rugby. As a schoolboy he became known as &quot;a sportsman of dash and endurance&quot;. At the age of fourteen he became a keen follower of horse-racing, a lifelong obsession that continually disrupted his finances. He commented that his first encounter with racing was &quot;a fatal day for me. I had one bet and lost half-a-crown, and I have been trying for fifty years to win it back.&quot;

From Rugby, Hawtrey went briefly to a crammer in London, to study for a career in the army, but soon abandoned the idea. He worked as a private tutor from 1876 to 1879 and then he began his theatrical career. It started badly: he broke his collar-bone while playing football and had to withdraw from the cast before the opening night. In February 1881 he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, but withdrew in October, having been cast in the supporting role of Edward Langton in F. C. Burnand&#x27;s &quot;The Colonel&quot; at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre, London. Uncertain of success, he temporarily adopted the stage name Charles Bankes. He was well received in the play, and was given valuable lessons in stagecraft from the producer:
==Actor-manager==
In early 1882 Hawtrey played Jack Merryweather in &quot;The Marble Arch&quot;, which starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Later in that year he toured in &quot;The Colonel&quot; in a cast headed by Charles Collette. Two of Hawtrey&#x27;s brothers, William and George (father of the economist Ralph Hawtrey), had also become actors, and in early 1883, Charles and William led a small touring company to towns in south-east England.
In 1884 Hawtrey had a huge success in London presenting his own adaptation of a German farce by Gustav von Moser, &quot;Der Bibliothekar&quot;, rewritten as &quot;The Private Secretary&quot; with the action moved to an English setting. It opened in March to disparaging reviews and at first played to small audiences, but Hawtrey persisted and further rewrote the play. It moved from the Prince&#x27;s to the Globe Theatre, the principal roles were recast (with Hawtrey playing the crusty old Cattermole), and in the words of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; &quot;the audiences steadily laughed it into a success.&quot; The production ran for 785 performances, and Hawtrey made £123,000 from it – an enormous sum for those days. The play was revived in London eight times during his life.

Hawtrey pursued a career as an actor-manager, making a speciality of suave, sometimes immoral, but likable characters. His managerial career was chequered: great successes were often followed by expensive failures, and he was bankrupt several times. He was in charge over the years at eighteen London theatres – including the Globe until 1887 and two spells at the Comedy Theatre, 1887–93 and 1896–98. He staged, &quot;with great attention to detail&quot;, about a hundred plays. His biographers H H Child and Michael Read list his most celebrated productions as two more adaptations from Moser (&quot;The Pickpocket&quot;, 1886, adapted by George Hawtrey, and &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;, 1887, by Sydney Grundy); &quot;Jane&quot; (1890) by Harry Nicholls and William Lestocq; &quot;One Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; (1897) by H. V. Esmond; &quot;Lord and Lady Algy&quot; (1898) by R. C. Carton co-starring with the author&#x27;s wife, Katherine Compton; &quot;A Message from Mars&quot; (1899) by Richard Ganthony; &quot;The Man from Blankley&#x27;s&quot; (1906) by F. Anstey; and &quot;Ambrose Applejohn&#x27;s Adventure&quot; (1921) by Walter Hackett, in which Hawtrey played two roles: a respectable modern man and his disreputable ancestor. Hawtrey&#x27;s career was long enough to allow him to create leading roles in plays by Oscar Wilde in the 1890s and Somerset Maugham after the First World War – he was Wilde&#x27;s Lord Goring in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895) and William in Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Home and Beauty&quot; (1919). In between his successes he went bankrupt several times, and on one occasion discharged his debts by successfully gambling at baccarat.

After the war Hawtrey appeared occasionally in silent films: &quot;A Message From Mars&quot; (1913) as Horace Parker, &quot;Honeymoon for Three&quot; (1915) as Prince Ferdinand, and &quot;Masks and Faces&quot; (1918) with George Alexander, George Bernard Shaw and J. M. Barrie.
Hawtrey was generous in fostering talent. Among the young actors whose careers he encouraged was Noël Coward, who wrote in his memoirs about &quot;the kindness and care of Hawtrey&#x27;s direction. He took endless trouble with me ... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day.&quot; One of the dramatists that he promoted was Horace Newte whose one act drama &quot;A Labour of Love&quot; Hawtrey presented at The Comedy Theatre in 1897.

==Personal life==
Hawtrey was twice married. His first wife, whom he married on 3 June 1886, was Madeline (&quot;Mae&quot;) Harriet, &quot;née&quot; Sheriffe; he left her in 1891 and she divorced him in 1893. She died in 1905. In 1909 his then partner, Olive Morris, bore him a son, Anthony Hawtrey. On 10 November 1919 Hawtrey married the Hon Mrs Albert Petre (&quot;née&quot; Katherine Elsie Clark), daughter of the Rev William Robinson Clark and widow of the youngest son of the 11th Baron Petre. There were no children of either of his marriages. His second wife died on 14 November 1930. According to Ada Coleman, head bartender at the Savoy Hotel London, Hawtrey was responsible for naming the Hanky-Panky cocktail, which she created specifically for him.

==Last years and posterity==
From 1920 Hawtrey&#x27;s health deteriorated. He was knighted in 1922. He lived at 37, Hertford Street, Mayfair, and had lived at Heatham House, Twickenham. He died in a London nursing home after a short illness, aged 64, on 30 July 1923. He is buried at Richmond Old Burial Ground. A memorial service was held for him at St Martin-in-the-Fields. His memoirs were edited by Maugham and published in 1924 as &quot;The Truth at Last&quot;.

<text>Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standards are an international set of standards for broadcast and digital television transmission over terrestrial, cable and satellite networks. It is largely a replacement for the analog NTSC standard – like that standard – is used mostly in the United States, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago. Several former NTSC users like Japan, have not used ATSC during their digital television transition, because they adopted other systems like ISDB developed by Japan and DVB developed in Europe, for example.

The ATSC standards were developed in the early 1990s by the Grand Alliance, a consortium of electronics and telecommunications companies that assembled to develop a specification for what is now known as HDTV. The standard is now administered by the Advanced Television Systems Committee. It includes a number of patented elements, and licensing is required for devices that use these parts of the standard. Key among these is the 8VSB modulation system used for over-the-air broadcasts. ATSC 1.0 technology was primarily developed with patent contributions from LG Electronics, which held most of the patents for the ATSC standard.

ATSC includes two primary high definition video formats, 1080i and 720p. It also includes standard-definition formats, although initially only HDTV services were launched in the digital format. ATSC can carry multiple channels of information on a single stream, and it is common for there to be a single high-definition signal and several standard-definition signals carried on a single 6 MHz (former NTSC) channel allocation.

== Background ==
The high-definition television standards defined by the ATSC produce widescreen 16:9 images up to 1920×1080 pixels in sizemore than six times the display resolution of the earlier standard. However, many different image sizes are also supported. The reduced bandwidth requirements of lower-resolution images allow up to six standard-definition &quot;subchannels&quot; to be broadcast on a single 6 MHz TV channel.

ATSC standards are marked A/&quot;x&quot; (&quot;x&quot; is the standard number) and can be downloaded for free from the ATSC&#x27;s website at ATSC.org. ATSC Standard A/53, which implemented the system developed by the Grand Alliance, was published in 1995; the standard was adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States in 1996. It was revised in 2009. ATSC Standard A/72 was approved in 2008 and introduces H.264/AVC video coding to the ATSC system.

ATSC supports 5.1-channel surround sound using Dolby Digital&#x27;s AC-3 format. Numerous auxiliary datacasting services can also be provided.

Many aspects of ATSC were patented, including elements of the MPEG video coding, the AC-3 audio coding, and the 8VSB modulation. The cost of patent licensing, estimated at up to per digital TV receiver, had prompted complaints by manufacturers.

As with other systems, ATSC depends on numerous interwoven standards, e.g., the EIA-708 standard for digital closed captioning, leading to variations in implementation.

== Digital switchover ==

ATSC replaced much of the analog NTSC television system in the United States on June 12, 2009, on August 31, 2011 in Canada, on December 31, 2012 in South Korea, and on December 31, 2015 in Mexico.

Broadcasters who used ATSC and wanted to retain an analog signal were temporarily forced to broadcast on two separate channels, as the ATSC system requires the use of an entire separate channel. Channel numbers in ATSC do not correspond to RF frequency ranges, as they did with analog television. Instead, virtual channels, sent as part of the metadata along with the program(s), allow channel numbers to be remapped from their physical RF channel to any other number 1 to 99, so that ATSC stations can either be associated with the related NTSC channel numbers, or all stations on a network can use the same number. There is also a standard for distributed transmission systems (DTx), a form of single-frequency network which allows for the synchronised operation of multiple on-channel booster stations.

== Audio ==
Dolby Digital AC-3 is used as the audio codec, though it was standardized as A/52 by the ATSC. It allows the transport of up to five channels of sound with a sixth channel for low-frequency effects (the so-called &quot;5.1&quot; configuration). In contrast, Japanese ISDB HDTV broadcasts use MPEG&#x27;s Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) as the audio codec, which also allows 5.1 audio output. DVB (see below) allows both.

MPEG-2 audio was a contender for the ATSC standard during the DTV &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; shootout, but lost out to Dolby AC-3. The Grand Alliance issued a statement finding the MPEG-2 system to be &quot;essentially equivalent&quot; to Dolby, but only after the Dolby selection had been made. Later, a story emerged that MIT had entered into an agreement with Dolby whereupon the university would be awarded a large sum of money if the MPEG-2 system was rejected. Dolby also offered an incentive for Zenith to switch their vote (which they did); however, it is unknown whether they accepted the offer.

== Video ==
The ATSC system supports a number of different display resolutions, aspect ratios, and frame rates. The formats are listed here by resolution, form of scanning (progressive or interlaced), and number of frames (or fields) per second (see also the TV resolution overview at the end of this article).

For transport, ATSC uses the MPEG systems specification, known as an MPEG transport stream, to encapsulate data, subject to certain constraints. ATSC uses 188-byte MPEG transport stream packets to carry data. Before decoding of audio and video takes place, the receiver must demodulate and apply error correction to the signal. Then, the transport stream may be demultiplexed into its constituent streams.

=== MPEG-2 ===
There are four basic display sizes for ATSC, generally known by referring to the number of lines of the picture height. NTSC and PAL image sizes are smallest, with a width of 720 (or 704) and a height of 480 or 576 lines. The third size is HDTV images that have 720 scan lines in height and are 1280 pixels wide. The largest size has 1080 lines high and 1920 pixels wide. 1080-line video is actually encoded with 1920×1088 pixel frames, but the last eight lines are discarded prior to display. This is due to a restriction of the MPEG-2 video format, which requires the height of the picture in luma samples (i.e. pixels) to be divisible by 16.

The lower resolutions can operate either in progressive scan or interlaced mode, but not the largest picture sizes. The 1080-line system does not support progressive images at the highest frame rates of 50, 59.94 or 60 frames per second, because such technology was seen as too advanced at the time. The standard also requires 720-line video be progressive scan, since that provides better picture quality than interlaced scan at a given frame rate, and there was no legacy use of interlaced scan for that format. The result is that the combination of maximum frame rate and picture size results in approximately the same number of samples per second for both the 1080-line interlaced format and the 720-line format, as 1920*1080*30 is roughly equal to 1280*720*60. A similar equality relationship applies for 576 lines at 25 frame per second versus 480 lines at 30 frames per second.

A terrestrial (over-the-air) transmission carries 19.39 megabits of data per second (a fluctuating bandwidth of about 18.3 Mbit/s left after overhead such as error correction, program guide, closed captioning, etc.), compared to a maximum possible MPEG-2 bitrate of 10.08 Mbit/s (7 Mbit/s typical) allowed in the DVD standard and 48 Mbit/s (36 Mbit/s typical) allowed in the Blu-ray disc standard.

Although the ATSC A/53 standard limits MPEG-2 transmission to the formats listed below (with integer frame rates paired with 1000/1001-rate versions), the U.S. Federal Communications Commission declined to mandate that television stations obey this part of the ATSC&#x27;s standard. In theory, television stations in the U.S. are free to choose any resolution, aspect ratio, and frame/field rate, within the limits of Main Profile @ High Level. Many stations do go outside the bounds of the ATSC specification by using other resolutions – for example, 352 x 480 or 720 x 480.

&quot;EDTV&quot; displays can reproduce progressive scan content and frequently have a 16:9 wide screen format. Such resolutions are 704×480 or 720×480 in NTSC and 720×576 in PAL, allowing 60 progressive frames per second in NTSC or 50 in PAL.

ATSC also supports PAL frame rates and resolutions which are defined in ATSC A/63 standard.

The ATSC A/53 specification imposes certain constraints on MPEG-2 video stream:

* The maximum bit rate value in the sequence header of the MPEG-2 video stream is 19.4 Mbit/s for broadcast television, and 38.8 Mbit/s for the &quot;high data rate&quot; mode (e.g., cable television). The actual MPEG-2 video bit rate will be lower, since the MPEG-2 video stream must fit inside a transport stream.
* The amount of MPEG-2 stream buffer required at the decoder (the vbv_buffer_size_value) must be less than or equal to 999,424 bytes.
* In most cases, the transmitter can&#x27;t start sending a coded image until within a half-second of when it&#x27;s to be decoded (vbv_delay less than or equal to 45000 90-kHz clock increments).
* The stream must include colorimetry information (gamma curve, the precise RGB colors used, and the relationship between RGB and the coded YCbCr).
* The video must be 4:2:0 (chrominance resolution must be 1/2 of luma horizontal resolution and 1/2 of luma vertical resolution).

The ATSC specification and MPEG-2 allow the use of progressive frames coded within an interlaced video sequence. For example, NBC stations transmit a 1080i60 video sequence, meaning the formal output of the MPEG-2 decoding process is sixty 540-line fields per second. However, for prime-time television shows, those 60 fields can be coded using 24 progressive frames as a base – actually, an 1080p24 video stream (a sequence of 24 progressive frames per second) is transmitted, and MPEG-2 metadata instructs the decoder to interlace these fields and perform 3:2 pulldown before display, as in soft telecine.

The ATSC specification also allows 1080p30 and 1080p24 MPEG-2 sequences, however they are not used in practice, because broadcasters want to be able to switch between 60 Hz interlaced (news), 30 Hz progressive or PsF (soap operas), and 24 Hz progressive (prime-time) content without ending the 1080i60 MPEG-2 sequence.

The 1080-line formats are encoded with 1920 × 1088 pixel luma matrices and 960 × 540 chroma matrices, but the last 8 lines are discarded by the MPEG-2 decoding and display process.

=== H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ===

In July 2008, ATSC was updated to support the ITU-T H.264 video codec. This standard is split in two parts:

* A/72 part 1: Video System Characteristics of AVC in the ATSC Digital Television System
* A/72 part 2 : AVC Video Transport Subsystem Characteristics

The standards support 1080p at 50, 59.94 and 60 frames per second; such frame rates require H.264/AVC &quot;High Profile Level 4.2&quot;, while standard HDTV frame rates only require Levels 3.2 and 4, and SDTV frame rates require Levels 3 and 3.1.

== Transport stream (TS) ==
The file extension &quot;.TS&quot; stands for &quot;transport stream&quot;, which is a media container format. It may contain a number of streams of audio or video content multiplexed within the transport stream. Transport streams are designed with synchronization and recovery in mind for potentially lossy distribution (such as over-the-air ATSC broadcast) in order to continue a media stream with minimal interruption in the face of data loss in transmission. When an over-the-air ATSC signal is captured to a file via hardware/software the resulting file is often in a .TS file format.

== Modulation and transmission ==
ATSC signals are designed to use the same 6 MHz bandwidth as analog NTSC television channels (the interference requirements of A/53 DTV standards with adjacent NTSC or other DTV channels are very strict). Once the digital video and audio signals have been compressed and multiplexed, the transport stream can be modulated in different ways depending on the method of transmission.

* Terrestrial (local) broadcasters use 8VSB modulation that can transfer at a maximum rate of 19.39 Mbit/s, sufficient to carry several video and audio programs and metadata.
* Cable television stations can generally operate at a higher signal-to-noise ratio and can use either the 16VSB as defined in ATSC or the 256-QAM defined in SCTE, to achieve a throughput of 38.78 Mbit/s, using the same 6 MHz channel.

The proposals for modulation schemes for digital television were developed when cable operators carried standard-resolution video as uncompressed analog signals. In recent years, cable operators have become accustomed to compressing standard-resolution video for digital cable systems, making it harder to find duplicate 6 MHz channels for local broadcasters on uncompressed &quot;basic&quot; cable.

Currently, the Federal Communications Commission requires cable operators in the United States to carry the analog or digital transmission of a terrestrial broadcaster (but not both), when so requested by the broadcaster (the &quot;must-carry rule&quot;). The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in Canada does not have similar rules in force with respect to carrying ATSC signals.

However, cable operators have still been slow to add ATSC channels to their lineups for legal, regulatory, and plant &amp; equipment related reasons. One key technical and regulatory issue is the modulation scheme used on the cable: cable operators in the U.S. (and to a lesser extent Canada) can determine their own method of modulation for their plants. Multiple standards bodies exist in the industry: the SCTE defined 256-QAM as a modulation scheme for cable in a cable industry standard, ANSI/SCTE 07 2006: Digital Transmission Standard For Cable Television . Consequently, most U.S. and Canadian cable operators seeking additional capacity on the cable system have moved to 256-QAM from the 64-QAM modulation used in their plant, in preference to the 16VSB standard originally proposed by ATSC. Over time 256-QAM is expected to be included in the ATSC standard.

There is also a standard for transmitting ATSC via satellite; however, this is only used by TV networks. Very few teleports outside the U.S. support the ATSC satellite transmission standard, but teleport support for the standard is improving. The ATSC satellite transmission system is not used for direct-broadcast satellite systems; in the U.S. and Canada these have long used either DVB-S (in standard or modified form) or a proprietary system such as DSS or DigiCipher 2.

== Other systems ==

ATSC coexists with the DVB-T standard, and with ISDB-T. A similar standard called ADTB-T was developed for use as part of China&#x27;s new DMB-T/H dual standard. While China has officially chosen a dual standard, there is no requirement that a receiver work with both standards and there is no support for the ADTB modulation from broadcasters or equipment and receiver manufacturers.

For compatibility with material from various regions and sources, ATSC supports the 480i video format used in the NTSC analog system (480 lines, approximately 60 fields or 30 frames per second), 576i formats used in most PAL regions (576 lines, 50 fields or 25 frames per second), and 24 frames-per-second formats used in film.

While the ATSC system has been criticized as being complicated and expensive to implement and use, both broadcasting and receiving equipment are now comparable in cost with that of DVB.

The ATSC signal is more susceptible to changes in radio propagation conditions than DVB-T and ISDB-T. It also lacks true hierarchical modulation, which would allow the SDTV part of an HDTV signal (or the audio portion of a television program) to be received uninterrupted even in fringe areas where signal strength is low. For this reason, an additional modulation mode, enhanced-VSB (E-VSB) has been introduced, allowing for a similar benefit.

In spite of ATSC&#x27;s fixed transmission mode, it is still a robust signal under various conditions. 8VSB was chosen over COFDM in part because many areas are rural and have a much lower population density, thereby requiring larger transmitters and resulting in large fringe areas. In these areas, 8VSB was shown to perform better than other systems.

COFDM is used in both DVB-T and ISDB-T, and for 1seg, as well as DVB-H and HD Radio in the United States. In metropolitan areas, where population density is highest, COFDM is said to be better at handling multipath propagation. While ATSC is also incapable of true single-frequency network (SFN) operation, the distributed transmission mode, using multiple synchronized on-channel transmitters, has been shown to improve reception under similar conditions. Thus, it may not require more spectrum allocation than DVB-T using SFNs. A comparison study found that ISDB-T and DVB-T performed similarly, and that both were outperformed by DVB-T2.

== Mobile TV ==
Mobile reception of digital stations using ATSC has, until 2008, been difficult to impossible, especially when moving at vehicular speeds. To overcome this, there are several proposed systems that report improved mobile reception: Samsung/Rhode &amp; Schwarz&#x27;s A-VSB, Harris/LG&#x27;s MPH, and a recent proposal from Thomson/Micronas; all of these systems have been submitted as candidates for a new ATSC standard, ATSC-M/H. After one year of standardization, the solution merged between Samsung&#x27;s AVSB and LGE&#x27;s MPH technology has been adopted and would have been deployed in 2009. This is in addition to other standards like the now-defunct MediaFLO, and worldwide open standards such as DVB-H and T-DMB. Like DVB-H and ISDB 1seg, the proposed ATSC mobile standards are backward compatible with existing tuners, despite being added to the standard well after the original standard was in wide use.

Mobile reception of some stations will still be more difficult, because 18 UHF channels in the U.S. have been removed from TV service, forcing some broadcasters to stay on VHF. This band requires larger antennas for reception, and is more prone to electromagnetic interference from engines and rapidly changing multipath conditions.

== Future ==

=== ATSC 2.0 ===
ATSC 2.0 was a planned major new revision of the standard which would have been backward compatible with ATSC 1.0. The standard was to have allowed interactive and hybrid television technologies by connecting the TV with the Internet services and allowing interactive elements into the broadcast stream. Other features were to have included advanced video compression, audience measurement, targeted advertising, enhanced programming guides, video on demand services, and the ability to store information on new receivers, including Non-realtime (NRT) content.

However, ATSC 2.0 was never actually launched, as it was essentially outdated before it could be launched. All of the changes that were a part of the ATSC 2.0 revision were adopted into ATSC 3.0.

=== ATSC 3.0 ===
ATSC 3.0 will provide even more services to the viewer and increased bandwidth efficiency and compression performance, which requires breaking backward compatibility with the current version. On November 17, 2017, the FCC voted 3–2 in favor of authorizing voluntary deployments of ATSC 3.0, and issued a Report and Order to that effect. ATSC 3.0 broadcasts and receivers are expected to emerge within the next decade.

LG Electronics tested the standard with 4K on February 23, 2016. With the test considered a success, South Korea announced that ATSC 3.0 broadcasts would start in February 2017.

On March 28, 2016, the Bootstrap component of ATSC 3.0 (System Discovery and Signalling) was upgraded from candidate standard to finalized standard.

On June 29, 2016, NBC affiliate WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, a station known for its pioneering roles in testing the original DTV standards, launched an experimental ATSC 3.0 channel carrying the station&#x27;s programming in 1080p, as well as a 4K demo loop.
;Structure/ATSC 3.0 System Layers
# Bootstrap: System Discovery and Signalling
# Physical Layer: Transmission (OFDM)
# Protocols: IP, MMT
# Presentation: Audio and Video standards (to be determined), Ultra HD with High Definition and standard-definition multicast, Immersive Audio

* 2018
* On December 14, 2011, the Bahamas&#x27; national public broadcaster ZNS-TV announced that it would adopt ATSC, in line with the United States and its territories.
* opened in digital television on December 4, 2024.
* adopted ATSC, with full-power analog stations in specified &quot;mandatory markets&quot; (which included provincial capitals, and cities with a population of 300,000 or higher) shutting down on August 31, 2011. The CBC only converted its originating stations to digital; it was given permission to operate its repeaters in mandatory markets (such as CBKST in Saskatoon) for an additional year, but later announced that it would shut down all of its analog repeaters on July 31, 2012—citing budget issues and their distribution network as being obsolete. 
* The Dominican Republic announced its adoption on August 10, 2010, completing the transition on September 24, 2015, but most companies were not able to meet the deadline and the government had to move it forward to the year 2021.
*
* Will convert to ATSC 3.0 instead of 1.0. The conversion will begin in 2022 and is expected to be completed by 2023.
* began converting to ATSC in 2013; a full transition was scheduled for December 31, 2015, but due to technical and economic issues for some transmitters, the full transition was extended to December 31, 2016.
* opened on Saint Lucia on ATSC on March 5, 2024.
* will convert to ATSC 3.0 instead of ATSC 1.0. The conversion process will begin in March 2023 and is expected to be completed by 2026.
* Full-power television stations in the United States ended analog television service on June 12, 2009. Analog low-power stations and translators were all wound down by July 13, 2021.

=== South America ===
* Suriname has undergone transitioning from analogue NTSC broadcasts to digital ATSC broadcasts. Channel ATV started with ATSC broadcasts in the Paramaribo area in June 2014, which was followed by ATSC broadcasts from stations in Brokopondo, Wageningen and Albina. The stations in Brokopondo, Wageningen and Albina broadcast both the channels of ATV (i.e., ATV and TV2) and STVS. In 2016 all channels in Suriname had already made the switch to ATSC.

=== Asia/Pacific ===
* South Korea completed its transition to ATSC on December 31, 2012, although it still operates some analog signals along its northern border for reception in North Korea. 
* territories in the Pacific, including American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands have adopted ATSC, as with the mainland.

<text>Permutation City is a 1994 science-fiction novel by Greg Egan that explores many concepts, including quantum ontology, through various philosophical aspects of artificial life and simulated reality. Sections of the story were adapted from Egan&#x27;s 1992 short story &quot;Dust&quot;, which dealt with many of the same philosophical themes. &quot;Permutation City&quot; won the John W. Campbell Award for the best science-fiction novel of the year in 1995 and was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award the same year. The novel was also cited in a 2003 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article on multiverses by Max Tegmark.

==Themes and setting==
&quot;Permutation City&quot; asks whether there is a difference between a computer simulation of a person and a &quot;real&quot; person. It focuses on a model of consciousness and reality, the &quot;Dust Theory&quot;, similar to the Ultimate Ensemble Mathematical Universe hypothesis proposed by Max Tegmark. It uses the assumption that human consciousness is Turing-computable: that consciousness can be produced by a computer program. The book deals with consequences of human consciousness being amenable to mathematical manipulation, as well as some consequences of simulated realities. In this way, Egan attempts to deconstruct notions of self, memory, and mortality, and of physical reality.

The Autoverse is an artificial life simulator based on a cellular automaton complex enough to represent the substratum of an artificial chemistry. It is deterministic, internally consistent and vaguely resembles real chemistry. Tiny environments, simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, &quot;Autobacterium lamberti&quot;, are maintained by a community of enthusiasts obsessed with getting &quot;A. lamberti&quot; to evolve, something the Autoverse chemistry seems to make extremely difficult.

Related explorations go on in virtual realities (VR), which make extensive use of patchwork heuristics to crudely simulate immersive and convincing physical environments, albeit at a maximal speed of seventeen times slower than &quot;real&quot; time, limited by the optical crystal computing technology used at the time of the story. Larger VR environments, covering a greater internal volume in greater detail, are cost-prohibitive even though VR worlds are computed selectively for inhabitants, reducing redundancy and extraneous objects and places to the minimal details required to provide a convincing experience to those inhabitants; for example, a mirror not being looked at would be reduced to a reflection value, with details being &quot;filled in&quot; as necessary if its owner were to turn their model-of-a-head towards it.

Within the story, &quot;Copies&quot; – digital renderings of human brains with complete subjective consciousness, the technical descendants of ever more comprehensive medical simulations – live within VR environments after a process of &quot;scanning&quot;. Copies are the only objects within VR environments that are simulated in full detail, everything else being produced with varying levels of generalisation, lossy compression, and hashing at all times.

Copies form the conceptual spine of the story, and much of the plot deals directly with the &quot;lived&quot; experience of Copies, most of whom are copies of billionaires suffering terminal illnesses or fatal accidents, who spend their existences in VR worlds of their creating, usually maintained by trust funds, which independently own and operate large computing resources for their sakes, separated physically and economically from most of the rest of the world&#x27;s computing power, which is privatized as a fungible commodity. Although the wealthiest copies face no financial difficulties, they can still be threatened because copies lack political and legal rights (they are considered software), especially where the global economy is in recession. Hence they cannot afford to retreat into solipsism and ignore what is happening in the real world.

At the opposite end from the wealthy Copies are those who can only afford to live in the virtual equivalent of &quot;Slums&quot;, being bounced around the globe to the cheapest physical computing available at any given time in order to save money, while running at much slower speeds compared to the wealthy Copies. Their slowdown rate depends on how much computer power their meager assets can afford, as computer power is traded on a global exchange and goes to the highest bidder at any point in time. When they cannot afford to be &quot;run&quot; at all, they can be frozen as a &quot;snapshot&quot; until computer power is relatively affordable again. A Copy whose financial assets can only generate sufficient interest to run at a very slow rate is stuck in a rut because he/she/it becomes unemployable and is unable to generate new income, which may lead to a downward spiral.

By creating this scenario, Egan postulates a world where economic inequality can persist even in one&#x27;s (virtual) afterlife.

The concept of solipsism is also examined prominently, with many less-wealthy Copies attending social functions called Slow Clubs, where socialising Copies agree to synchronise with the slowest person present. Many of these less-wealthy Copies become completely deracinated from their former lives and from world events, or else become &quot;Witnesses&quot;, who spend their time observing (at considerable time lapse) world events unfold, at the cost of any meaningful relationships with their fellow Copies. A subculture of lower/middle-class Copies, calling themselves &quot;Solipsist Nation&quot; after a philosophical work by their nominal founder, choose to completely repudiate the &quot;real&quot; world and any Copies still attached to it, reprogramming their models-of-brains and their VR environments in order to design themselves into their own personal vision of paradise, of whatever size and detail, disregarding slowdown in the process.

Egan&#x27;s later novels &quot;Diaspora&quot; and &quot;Schild&#x27;s Ladder&quot; deal with related issues from other perspectives.

==Story==
The plot of Permutation City follows the lives of several people in a near future reality where the Earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change, the economy and culture are largely globalised, and civilisation has accumulated vast amounts of cloud computing power and memory which is distributed internationally and is traded in a public market called the QIPS Exchange (Quadrillion Instructions Per Second, see MIPS).

Most importantly, this great computing capacity has enabled the creation of Copies, whole brain emulations of &quot;scanned&quot; humans which are detailed enough to allow for subjective conscious experience on the part of the emulation. Scanning has become safe enough and common enough to allow for a few wealthy or dedicated humans to afford to create backups of themselves. Copies do not yet possess human rights under the laws of any nation or international body.

===Part one===
In 2050, Paul Durham, a Sydney man having experimented on Copies of himself, offers wealthy Copies prime real estate in an advanced supercomputer which, according to his pitch, will never be shut down and never experience any slowdown whatsoever. Durham predicts that efforts to utilise chaotic effects will clash with Copy rights, as both Copies and weather simulations will demand increasing QIPS Exchange shares. All that each Copy must do is to make the comparatively small investment of &quot;two million ecus&quot; in order to bring Durham&#x27;s fantasy computer into existence.

Durham hires Maria Deluca, an Autoverse enthusiast, to design an Autoverse program which, given a powerful enough computer, could generate a planet&#x27;s worth of evolvable Autoverse life. He also clandestinely commissions a famous virtual reality architect, Malcolm Carter, to build a full scale VR city; outside of Durham&#x27;s knowledge, Carter secretly hacks two Slum-dwelling Solipsist Nation Copies (Peer and Kate) into this city&#x27;s machine code. When Maria learns of a computer fraud investigation on Durham, she confronts him.

Durham reveals that his self-experiments convinced him that there is no difference, even in principle, between physics and mathematics, and that all mathematically possible structures exist, among them our physics and therefore our spacetime, a belief he refers to as &quot;Dust Theory&quot;. The dust theory implies that all possible universes exist and are equally real, emerging spontaneously from their own mathematical self-consistency. Because Copies exist in virtual realities held together by heuristics merely for the sake of their experience, it should be the case that when a Copy is terminated and deleted, its own conscious experience will continue. Indeed, Durham himself claims to have been through such a process dozens of times.

Durham uses the money from his financial backing to simulate a minute or two of a &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; configuration of an infinitely-expanding, massively complex cellular automaton universe, in which each iteration of the expansion serves to &quot;manufacture&quot; an extra layer of blocks of a computing configuration. According to his Dust Theory, such a simulation would create a self-consistent &quot;TVC universe&quot; to persist in its own terms even after its termination and deletion. His and his investors&#x27; Copies would therefore persist indefinitely in the simulation. The Autoverse planetary seed program designed by Maria is included in the TVC universe package for his investors to explore once life had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the TVC universe (referred to as &quot;Planet Lambert&quot;).

After a successful launch, simulation, termination, and deletion of the TVC universe, Durham and Maria have uncomfortable sex in awkward celebration, and later that night, while Maria is asleep, Durham disembowels himself with a kitchen knife in his bathtub, believing his role as the springboard for his deleted TVC Copy to discover its true identity to be fulfilled.

===Part two===
Maria wakes in Permutation City seven thousand years of subjective time after the launch, furious at Durham for awakening her. He explains to her that intelligent life has arisen on Planet Lambert in the form of complex swarms of insect-like eusocial beings, evolved from Maria&#x27;s original &quot;Autobacterium hydrophilus&quot;. He wishes to use Maria&#x27;s slice of the universe&#x27;s processing power (as a founder of the world she was given de facto control of a continuously-growing zone of the processor network as well) to make forbidden first contact with Lambertians. He believes this is necessary because he has lost the ability to pause the Autoverse simulation or slow it down past a constant multiple of the size of the processor network it occupies. Durham is worried that the rules of their simulated universe are breaking down.

They discover that the combined intelligence of Lambertians has exceeded that of Permutation City; as such, the TVC universe is being overwritten into a system existing solely as a byproduct of the self-perpetuation of the Autoverse. Durham, Maria, and some other companions quickly launch an emergency expedition into the Autoverse to attempt to convince the Lambertians of the validity of the creator hypothesis and its methodological preferentiality over their own newly formulated theory. Unfortunately, the Lambertians reject the creator theory, prompting Permutation City and the entirety of TVC processor-networks to begin collapsing into nothing. Durham and Maria inform the inhabitants of Permutation City, who launch a new TVC Garden of Eden in their universe&#x27;s final moments. Maria convinces a reluctant Durham to come along to a new universe, pledging to work with her to discover the underlying rules that governed the Autoverse&#x27;s takeover of Permutation City.

<doc id="272329" wikidata="Q348789" url="?curid=272329" title="Environment and Climate Change Canada">
<text>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC; ) is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for coordinating environmental policies and programs, as well as preserving and enhancing the natural environment and renewable resources. It is also colloquially known by its former name, Environment Canada (EC; ).

The minister of environment and climate change has been Steven Guilbeault since October 26, 2021; Environment and Climate Change Canada supports the minister&#x27;s mandate to: &quot;preserve and enhance the quality of the natural environment, including water, air, soil, flora and fauna; conserve Canada&#x27;s renewable resources; conserve and protect Canada&#x27;s water resources; forecast daily weather conditions and warnings, and provide detailed meteorological information to all of Canada; enforce rules relating to boundary waters; and coordinate environmental policies and programs for the federal government.&quot; The minister provides political direction and is responsible for the department to Parliament, with the day-to-day operations being managed by the deputy minister.

== History ==
=== Federal role ===
Under the Constitution of Canada, responsibility for environmental management in Canada is a shared responsibility between the federal government and provincial governments. For example, provincial governments have primary authority for resource management including permitting industrial waste discharges (e.g., to the air). The federal government is responsible for the management of toxic substances in the country (e.g., benzene). The department provides stewardship of the Environmental Choice Program, which provides consumers with an eco-labelling for products manufactured within Canada or services that meet international label standards of (GEN) Global Ecolabelling Network.

Under the &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot; (CEPA 1999) (R.S., 1999, c. 33), ECCC became the lead federal department to ensure the cleanup of hazardous waste and oil spills for which the government is responsible, and to provide technical assistance to other jurisdictions and the private sector as required. The department is also responsible for international environmental issues (e.g., Canada-US air issues). CEPA was the central piece of Canada&#x27;s environmental legislation but was replaced when budget implementation Bill C-38 entered into effect in June 2012.

=== &quot;Canada Water Act&quot; and creation of department ===
&quot;Recognizing the need for better environmental management, the federal government passed the &quot;Canada Water Act&quot; in 1970 and created the Department of the Environment in 1971, entrusting the Inland Waters Directorate with providing national leadership for freshwater management. Under the &quot;Constitution Act&quot;, &quot;1867&quot;, the provinces are &quot;owners&quot; of the water resources and have wide responsibilities in their day-to-day management. The federal government has certain specific responsibilities relating to water, such as fisheries and navigation, as well as exercising certain overall responsibilities such as the conduct of external affairs.&quot;

The &quot;Canada Water Act&quot; (proclaimed on September 30, 1970) provides the framework for cooperation with provinces and territories in the conservation, development, and utilization of Canada&#x27;s water resources. The &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot;, 1999, completes the framework for the protection and of water resources. Environment and Climate Change Canada is the federal department in charge of conserving and protecting Canada&#x27;s water resources. The &quot;Water Act&quot; (2000), a federal legislation, &quot;supports and promotes the conservation and management of water, including the wise allocation and use of water.&quot;. The provinces are responsible for administering the &quot;Water Act&quot; (2000). In Alberta for example, Alberta Environment and Water is responsible for administering the &quot;Water Act&quot; (2000) and the &quot;Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act&quot; (2000). Provinces environmental ministries primarily lead Water for Life (2003) programs. Provinces also implement and oversee &quot;regulation of municipal drinking water, wastewater, and storm drainage systems.&quot;

=== Kyoto Accord and aftermath ===
The 1997 Kyoto Accord caused Minister David Anderson and the Chretien government to launch the &quot;Government of Canada Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change&quot;, which was mentioned in passing by the Governor-General in her January 30, 2000 Speech from the Throne. Despite strong objections from the governments of Saskatchewan, Alberta and Ontario and the federal Official Opposition, in securing Canadian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in December 2002.

In 2004 Anderson was successful in getting the Species at Risk Act passed by Parliament and signed into law. Other initiatives involved improving air and water quality and established improved federal provincial cooperation on environmental issues.

In December 2011, Stephen Harper&#x27;s Minister of the Environment Peter Kent announced Canada&#x27;s withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol one day after negotiators from nearly 200 countries meeting in Durban, South Africa at the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference (November 28 – December 11), completed a marathon of climate talks to establish a new treaty to limit carbon emissions. The Durban talks were leading to a new binding treaty with targets for all countries to take effect in 2020.

Kent argued that, &quot;The Kyoto protocol does not cover the world&#x27;s largest two emitters, the United States and China, and therefore cannot work.&quot; In 2010 Canada, Japan and Russia said they would not accept new Kyoto commitments. Canada is the only country to repudiate the Kyoto Accord. Kent argued that since Canada could not meet targets, it needed to avoid the $14 billion in penalties for not achieving its goals. This decision drew widespread international response. States for which the emissions are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol (the US and China) have the largest emissions, being responsible for 41% of the Kyoto Protocol. China&#x27;s emissions increased by over 200% from 1990 to 2009 as canny industrialists moved there to avoid taxation. By 2011 the magnesium industry in Canada, which had been ranked second in 2000, had been regulated out of existence.

Harper and Jim Flaherty&#x27;s 2012 federal budget&#x27;s &quot;Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act&quot; replaced the &quot;Canadian Environmental Assessment Act&quot; (CEAA 1992, 1999) with the&quot; Canadian Environmental Assessment Act&quot;, 2012. &quot;The Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot;, &quot;Species at Risk Act&quot;, &quot;The National Energy Board Act&quot;, the &quot;Canadian Oil and Gas Operations Act&quot;, the &quot;Nuclear Safety and Control Act&quot;, the &quot;Fisheries Act&quot; (for example, closing the Experimental Lakes Area) all underwent major changes under Bill C-38 of the 41st Canadian Parliament. By placing the emphasis on jobs, growth and prosperity significant changes have been made to the federal environmental assessment regime (EA) and environmental regulatory framework.

In 2015, the newly elected Trudeau government changed the applied title of the department under the Federal Identity Program from &quot;Environment Canada&quot; to &quot;Environment and Climate Change Canada&quot;. The new administration said this change was made in order to &quot;reflect the government&#x27;s priorities&quot;.

In early 2018, the government of Justin Trudeau passed the &quot;Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act&quot; (GHGPPA). In early 2019, the government of Justin Trudeau passed the &quot;Impact Assessment Act&quot; and &quot;Canadian Energy Regulator Act&quot;s (IAA and CERA) under minister Catherine McKenna.

On March 25, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the 2019 appeal of the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, and Saskatchewan and ruled in &quot;Reference re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act&quot; that the GHGPPA was constitutional.

On April 6, 2022, Equinor&#x27;s project on the Bay du Nord property was approved under Section 54 of the &quot;Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012&quot; by the federal cabinet and Minister Guilbeault. The CEAA was used because the assessment was initiated before that law was voided by the IAA.

== Operations ==

The department is divided into several geographic regions:

* National Capital
* Atlantic and Quebec Region (Atlantic Canada, Maritimes, Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec)
* Ontario
* West and North (Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, British Columbia, and Prairies)

The department has several organizations which carry out specific tasks:

* Enforcement Branch
** Environmental Enforcement
** Wildlife Enforcement
* Environmental Protection Branch
** Canadian Wildlife Service
** Chemical Sectors
** Energy and Transportation
** Environmental Protection Operations
** Legislative and Regulatory Affairs
** Strategic Priorities
* Meteorological Service of Canada (for weather forecasting; climate, air quality and water monitoring)
** Weather and environmental monitoring (Climate Monitoring, Water Survey of Canada)

=== Weather and Environmental Operations (Regional Weather Operations) ===
** Weather and Environmental Prediction and Services (Defence Weather Services, Marine and Ice Services (Canadian Ice Service), National Weather Predictions, Weatheradio Canada, a national system of emergency weather broadcast transmitters)
** Canadian Hurricane Centre
* Science and Technology Branch
** Atmospheric and Climate Science
** Water Science and Technology Directorate (including the National Water Research Institute)
** National Pollutant Release Inventory
** Wildlife and Landscape Science
**Air Quality Mobile Source Emissions Measurement and Research

=== Agencies ===
The Impact Assessment Agency of Canada is an arms-length agency that reports to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change.

Parks Canada, which manages the Canadian National Parks system, was removed from Environment Canada and became an agency reporting to the minister of Canadian heritage in 1998. In 2003, responsibility for Parks Canada was returned to the minister of the environment&#x27;s portfolio.

=== Enforcement activities ===
The Enforcement Branch is responsible for ensuring compliance with several federal statutes. Enforcement officers are appointed pursuant to section 217(3) of the &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot;, having all the powers of peace officers.

There are two designations of enforcement officers: Environmental Enforcement and Wildlife Enforcement. The former administers the &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot; and pollution provisions of the &quot;Fisheries Act&quot; and corresponding regulations. The latter enforces &quot;Migratory Birds Convention Act&quot;, &quot;Canada Wildlife Act&quot;, &quot;Species at Risk Act&quot; and &quot;The Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act&quot;. All officers wear dark green uniform with black ties and a badge (appear on the right). Environmental Enforcement Officers only carry baton and OC spray whereas Wildlife Enforcement Officers are also equipped with firearm.

The minister may also appoint members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, fishery officers, parks officers, customs officers and conservation officers of provincial and territorial governments as enforcement officers and to allow them to exercise the powers of Department of Environment officers.

==== Electronic waste ====

The Export and Import of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations (EIHWHRMR) operates with a few basic premises, one of which being that electronic waste is either &quot;intact&quot; or &quot;not intact&quot;. The various annexes define hazardous waste in Canada, and also deem any waste that is &quot;...considered or defined as hazardous under the legislation of the country receiving it and is prohibited by that country from being imported or conveyed in transit&quot; to be covered under Canadian regulation and therefore subject to prior informed consent procedures.

Since Canada ratified the Basel Convention on August 28, 1992, and as of August 2011, the Enforcement Branch has initiated 176 investigations for violations under EIHWHRMR, some of which are still in progress. There have been 19 prosecutions undertaken for non-compliance with the provisions of the EIHWHRMR some of which are still before the courts.

== Notable related legislation ==
The department administers and assists in the administration of nearly c. 24 acts through regulations and through &quot;voluntary and regulated agreements with individuals or multiple parties in Canada and elsewhere to define mutual commitments, roles and responsibilities and actions on specific environmental issues.&quot;

=== &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot; ===
The &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot; governs Parks Canada Agency.

=== &quot;Canada Wildlife Act&quot; ===
&quot;Canada Wildlife Act&quot; (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-9) Amended in June 2012 by Bill C-38 &#x27;allows for the creation, management and protection of wildlife areas&#x27; to preserve habitats, particularly for at risk species and requires permits for specified activities in designated wildlife areas.

=== &quot;Impact Assessment Act&quot; (2019) ===

The &quot;Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act&quot; (2000) &quot;supports and promotes the protection, enhancement, and wise use of the environment. The Act&#x27;s individual regulations cover a wide range of activities, from beverage container recycling and pesticide sales, potable water, to wastewater and storm drainage.&quot;

=== &quot;Migratory Birds Convention Act&quot; ===
First enacted in 1917, the &quot;Migratory Birds Convention Act&quot; protects most species of birds in Canada through regulations surrounding hunting, culling, and scientific research.

<doc id="272350" wikidata="Q497378" url="?curid=272350" title="PC bang">
<text>A PC bang () is a type of internet cafe or LAN gaming center in South Korea. Patrons can use computers, often to play video games in person with friends, for an hourly fee.

Although the per capita penetration of personal computers and broadband internet access in South Korea is one of the highest in the world, PC &quot;bangs&quot; remain popular as they provide a social meeting place for gamers (especially school-aged gamers) to play together with their peers. Aside from the social aspect, PC &quot;bangs&quot;&#x27; ability to offer access to expensive and powerful high-end personal computers (better known as gaming PCs), designed specifically for video gaming, at a comparatively low price has also bolstered their popularity.

==History==
The origin of PC &quot;bang&quot; starts with &#x27;전자카페&#x27; (&#x27;Jeonja Kape&#x27;, which literally translates to &#x27;Electronic Cafe&#x27;) in South Korea opened in March 1988, which was then closed in 1991. The original creators of the &#x27;전자카페&#x27;, Ahn Sang-soo (Professor of Hongik University) and Gum Nu-ri (Professor of Kookmin University), launched this electronic cafe next to Hongik University.

At the time, people were able to use two 16-bit computers, which were connected by a telephone line. However, it was only known to locals and not widely known, yet.

==Industry==

The most played games in PC &quot;bangs&quot; are known as massively multiplayer online role-playing games, in which more than 100,000 people around the globe can play at the same time. PC &quot;bangs&quot; rose to popularity following the release of the PC game &quot;StarCraft&quot; in 1998. At the time South Korea had a thriving computer industry with Internet use reaching over 50% of the population. , 25 million citizens were using the Internet, and 14.4 million Korean homes were equipped with Internet access. Accompanying this high rate of home Internet access it is estimated the number of PC &quot;bangs&quot; grew from 100 to 25,000 between 1997 and 2011. Many popular South Korean multiplayer games provide players with incentives which encourage them to play from a PC &quot;bang&quot;. For example, the Nexon games Kart Rider and BnB reward players with bonus &quot;Lucci&quot; — the games&#x27; virtual currencies — when they log on from a PC &quot;bang&quot;.

==Demographics==

Although PC &quot;bangs&quot; are used by all ages and genders, they are most popular with male gamers in their teens and twenties. Throughout the day, the demographics of the PC room change. Most PC rooms are open 24 hours. In the mornings, the primary type of user is an adult male, between 30 and 50. During the afternoons, young males come in groups between 1-3 pm. During this time is when PC &quot;bangs&quot; are the noisiest. Around dinner time, teenagers and young adults come in. They usually play online card games, arcade games, or MMORPGs. Competitive game players (ages 18 and up) start coming in at 8pm and usually stay for several hours or all night. &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Lineage II&quot;, &quot;Sudden Attack&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot; are the most popular games for late-night players.

==Social aspect==
PC &quot;bang&quot; industry has created a culture that is participated in by most youth in South Korea. Gamers have turned the PC &quot;bang&quot; into a socialization facility, becoming a huge part in the lives of South Korean youths today. Many students have suggested that the PC-Bang provides a stress free, fun and youth dominated environment where groups of friends can meet and engage in a cooperative game. They have suggested that the games themselves may promote a social environment by promoting the development of squads or groups of players to play the game more effectively.

==Addiction==
With computer and Internet access so readily available to the public, both at home and at PC &quot;bangs&quot;, gaming addiction has become a concern. The consequences of several hours spent at the PC &quot;bang&quot; gaming and the strong need to compete causes increased addiction and displacement problems of South Korean PC &quot;bang&quot; users. The biggest displacements due to addiction include sleep, school, homework, promises to meet with friends and time spent with friends. As part of its efforts to battle online game addictions among teenagers, South Korea introduced a law in 2011 that prohibits those aged 16 and under from playing online games between midnight and 6 a.m. The law mainly targets PC online games as well as consoles with online features. It allows a two-year grace period for smartphone and tablet PC games before reconsidering if they should be included, as online game addictions on those platforms are not currently considered a serious problem.

==Industry impact==
South Korean PC &quot;bangs&quot; have been identified as the source of a large number of players that use software tools to cheat in the video game &quot;Overwatch&quot;, effectively making play on Asian servers for the game unenjoyable for others. The game&#x27;s publisher Blizzard Entertainment has arranged deals with many PC &quot;bangs&quot; to allow anyone using the site to play &quot;Overwatch&quot; without purchasing the game as part of the hourly fee. Because of the competitive and youthful nature of the average PC &quot;bang&quot; user, many of these players use tools like aimbots to gain the upper edge in &quot;Overwatch&quot; matches as to show off to friends. While Blizzard does ban accounts from using these types of hacks, PC &quot;bang&quot; users can quickly make a new Battle.net account and jump back into the game, using the same tools. Blizzard reports handling thousands of such bans a day from South Korea. From February 2017 onward, Blizzard requires South Korean players to log into a Battle.net account in order to play &quot;Overwatch&quot; and other Blizzard games. As creating a Battle.net account requires unique personal information including difficult-to-spoof South Korean social security numbers, Blizzard anticipates this will limit creation of throwaway accounts and alleviate the situation.

* December 8 – A Peruvian Naval Aviation Fokker F27 chartered by the Peruvian association football club Alianza Lima crashes into the Pacific Ocean off the Ventanilla District of Callao, Peru, killing 43 of the 44 people on board. Among the dead are José Casanova, Luis Antonio Escobar, José González Ganoza, Alfredo Tomassini, Johnny Watson, and 11 other players; head coach Marcos Calderon and nine other coaches and team staff; eight cheerleaders; three referees; two Peruvian Navy passengers; and five crew members. The pilot is the only survivor.
* December 15 – Since December 1, Iraq has conducted eight airstrikes against shipping in the Persian Gulf and seven against urban and economic targets in Iran. Iran has carried out five airstrikes against Persian Gulf shipping and two against urban and economic targets in Iraq.
* December 21 – Air Littoral Flight 1919, an Embraer EMB 120 of Air Littoral (operating for Air France), crashed in Bordeaux-Mérignac Airport, France, during landing killing all 16 occupants on board.
* December 22 – The Iraqi Air Force conducts an unusually long-range raid, striking shipping around Iran″s Larak Island. The raid hits four supertankers employed as storage ships there, including the world″s largest ship, &quot;Seawise Giant&quot;.
* December 31 – Iraq claims that it has hit four ships in the Persian Gulf since December 26, although none actually have been damaged. Since December 16, Iraq has conducted nine airstrikes against shipping in the Persian Gulf and a single airstrike against urban and economic targets in Iran. Iran has carried out 10 airstrikes against Persian Gulf shipping, but none against urban and economic targets in Iraq. During 1987, Iraq has conducted 83 attacks – mostly by air – on shipping in the Persian Gulf, an increase from 65 in 1986, while Iran has conducted 80, mostly by using surface warships, speedboats, and naval mines. Since 1984, Iraq has attacked 215 ships in the Persian Gulf, destroying 49 and badly damaging nine, while Iran has destroyed 16. Despite the Iraqi and Iranian antishipping campaigns, Iranian oil exports for 1987 are 40 percent higher in 1987 than in 1986 and both Iranian and Iraqi oil exports have increased during the second half of 1987.

<doc id="272376" wikidata="Q1347798" url="?curid=272376" title="Abyssinia Crisis">
<text>The Abyssinia Crisis, also known in Italy as the Walwal incident, was an international crisis in 1935 that originated in a dispute over the town of Walwal, which then turned into a conflict between Fascist Italy and the Ethiopian Empire (then commonly known as &quot;Abyssinia&quot;). The League of Nations ruled against Italy and voted for economic sanctions, but they were never fully applied. Italy ignored the sanctions, quit the League, made special deals with the United Kingdom and France and ultimately annexed and occupied Abyssinia after it had won the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The crisis is generally regarded as having discredited the League.

==Walwal incident==

The Italo–Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 stated that the border between Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was 21 leagues from and parallel to the Banaadir coast (approximately ). In 1930, Italy built a fort at the Walwal oasis in the eastern Ogaden, well beyond the 21-league limit. The fort was in a boundary zone between the nations, which was not well defined, and is now about inside Ethiopia.

On 29 September 1934, Italy and Abyssinia released a joint statement renouncing any aggression against each other.

On 22 November 1934, a force of 1,000 Ethiopian militia with three &quot;fitaurari&quot; (Ethiopian military-political commanders) arrived near Walwal and formally asked the Dubats garrison stationed there (comprising about 60 soldiers) to withdraw from the area. The Somali NCO leading the garrison refused to withdraw and alerted Captain Cimmaruta, the commander of the garrison of Uarder, away, to what had happened.

The next day, in the course of surveying the border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia, an Anglo–Ethiopian boundary commission arrived at Walwal. The commission was confronted by a newly-arrived Italian force. The British members of the boundary commission protested but withdrew to avoid an international incident. The Ethiopian members of the boundary commission, however, stayed at Walwal.

From the 5th of December to the 7th, for reasons which have never been clearly determined, there was a skirmish between the garrison of Somalis, who were in Italian service, and a force of armed Ethiopians. According to the Italians, the Ethiopians attacked the Somalis with rifle and machine-gun fire. According to the Ethiopians, the Italians attacked them and were supported by two tanks and three aircraft. In the end, approximately 107 Ethiopians and 50 Italians and Somalis were killed.

Neither side did anything to avoid confrontation; the Ethiopians repeatedly menaced the Italian garrison with the threat of an armed attack, and the Italians sent two planes over the Ethiopian camp. One of them fired a short machine-gun burst, which no one on the ground noticed, after the pilot saw Captain Cimmaruta in the midst of the Ethiopians and thought that he had been taken prisoner by them.

==International response and subsequent actions==
On 6 December 1934, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia protested the Italian aggression at Walwal. On 8 December, Italy demanded an apology for Ethiopian aggression, and on 11 December, it followed up that demand with another for financial and strategic compensation.

On 3 January 1935, Ethiopia appealed to the League of Nations for arbitration of the dispute arising from the Walwal incident. However, the League&#x27;s response was inconclusive. A subsequent analysis by an arbitration committee of the League of Nations absolved both parties of any culpability from all events.

Shortly after Ethiopia&#x27;s initial appeal, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Pierre Laval and British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare met with the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, in Rome.

On 7 January 1935, a meeting between Laval and Mussolini resulted in the Franco-Italian Agreement, which gave Italy parts of French Somaliland (now Djibouti), redefined the official status of Italians in French-held Tunisia and essentially gave Italy a free hand in dealing with Ethiopia. In exchange, France hoped for Italian support against Germany.

On 25 January, five Italian askaris were killed by Ethiopian forces near Walwal.

On 10 February 1935, Mussolini mobilised two divisions. On 23 February, Mussolini began to send large numbers of troops to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, the Italian colonies that bordered Ethiopia to the northeast and the southeast respectively. There was little international protest in response to the military build-up.

On 8 March, Ethiopia again requested arbitration and noted the Italian military build-up. Three days later, Italy and Ethiopia agreed on a neutral zone in the Ogaden. On 17 March, in response to the continued Italian build-up, Ethiopia again appealed to the League for help. On 22 March, the Italians yielded to pressure from the League to submit to arbitration on the dispute arising from the Walwal incident but continued to mobilise its troops in the region. On 11 May, Ethiopia again protested the ongoing Italian mobilisation.

Between 20 and 21 May, the League held a special session to discuss the crisis in Ethiopia. On 25 May, a League council resolved that it would meet if no fifth arbitrator had been selected by 25 June or if a settlement had not been reached by 25 August. On 19 June, Ethiopia requested neutral observers.

From 23 to 24 June, the United Kingdom tried to quell the crisis by sending Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Anthony Eden to try to broker a peace agreement. The attempt was unsuccessful, and it became clear that Mussolini was intent on conquest. On 25 July, the United Kingdom imposed an embargo on arms sales to both Italy and Ethiopia. Many historians believe that the embargo was a response to Italy&#x27;s decree that it would view arms sales to Ethiopia as an act of unfriendliness toward Italy, but other observers believe that the United Kingdom was protecting its economic interests in East Africa. The United Kingdom also cleared its warships from the Mediterranean Sea, which allowed Italy further unhindered access to East Africa.

On 25 June, Italian and Ethiopian officials met in The Hague to discuss arbitration. By 9 July, the discussions had failed.

On 26 July, the League confirmed that no fifth member of the arbitration panel had been selected. On 3 August, the League prevented arbitration talks from being held on the sovereignty of Walwal.

On 12 August, Ethiopia pleaded for the arms embargo to be lifted. On 16 August, France and the United Kingdom offered Italy large concessions in Ethiopia to try to avert war, but Italy rejected the offers. On 22 August, the United Kingdom reaffirmed its commitment to the arms embargo.

On 4 September, the League met again and exonerated Italy and Ethiopia of any culpability in the Walwal incident on the ground that each nation had believed Walwal to be in its own territorial borders. On 10 September, Laval, Eden and even Hoare agreed on limitations to sanctions against Italy.

On 25 September, Ethiopia again asked for neutral observers.

On 27 September, the British Parliament supported the initiative of Konni Zilliacus and unanimously authorised the imposition of sanctions against Italy if it continued its policy towards Ethiopia.

On 28 September, Ethiopia began to mobilize its large but poorly-equipped army.

On 7 November, the Irish Free State passed the League of Nations Bill, which placed sanctions on Italy.

The League of Nations had described Ethiopia as follows:

At places where there is not a single Italian national, a consul establishes himself in an area known as consular territory with a guard of about ninety men, for whom he claims jurisdictional immunity. This is an obvious abuse of consular privileges. The abuse is all the greater that the consul&#x27;s duties, apart from the supplying of information of a military character, take the form of assembling stocks of arms, which constitute a threat to the peace of the country, whether from the internal or the international point of view.

==War and occupation==

On 3 October 1935, shortly after the League had exonerated both parties in the Walwal incident, Italian armed forces from Eritrea invaded Ethiopia without a declaration of war, which prompted Ethiopia to declare war on Italy and thus started the Second Italo–Ethiopian War.

On 7 October in what would come to be known as the &quot;Riddell Incident&quot;, the League of Nations declared Italy to be the aggressor and started the slow process of imposing economic sanctions on Italy. The sanctions were limited, however, since they did not prohibit the provision of several vital materials, such as oil, and were not carried out by all members of the League. The Canadian delegate to the League, Walter Alexander Riddell, suggested for the League to add steel and oil to the sanctions, which caused the world press to speak of the &quot;Canadian initiative&quot; and of the bold decision taken by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in pressing for oil sanctions against Italy. Riddell, who had acted on his own, was promptly disavowed by Mackenzie King, who characteristically announced that it was absolutely untrue that he made a decision, he had made no decision about anything and he had never heard of the &quot;Canadian initiative&quot; in Geneva. Mackenzie King&#x27;s opposition to Riddell&#x27;s &quot;Canadian initiative&quot; was motivated by domestic politics since Mussolini was widely admired in Catholic Quebec, especially by its nationalistic intelligentsia, and Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberal Party had just won the majority of the seats in Quebec in the 1935 election. Mackenzie King was terrified of the possibility of Canada taking the lead in imposing oil sanctions against Italy would cause the Liberals to lose their seats in Quebec in the next election. Thus, no more was heard of the &quot;Canadian initiative&quot;.

The United States, which was generally indifferent to the League&#x27;s weak sanctions, increased its exports to Italy, and the United Kingdom and France did not take any serious action against Italy, such as blocking Italian access to the Suez Canal. Even Italy&#x27;s use of chemical weapons and other actions that violated international norms did little to change the League&#x27;s passive approach to the situation.

In late December 1935, Hoare of the United Kingdom and Laval of France proposed the secret Hoare-Laval Pact, which would have ended the war but allowed Italy to control large areas of Ethiopia. Mussolini agreed to consider the plan to buy time for fear of oil sanctions against Italy, but he had no intention of accepting it. The plan caused an outcry and heavy public criticism in the United Kingdom and France when the plan was leaked to the media. Hoare and Laval were accused of betraying the Abyssinians, and both resigned. The pact was dropped, but the perception spread that the United Kingdom and France were not serious about the League&#x27;s principles. The war continued, and Mussolini turned to the German dictator, Adolf Hitler, for an alliance.

In March 1936, Hitler marched troops into the Rhineland, which had been prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles. The French were now so desperate to get Italian support against German aggression directly on their border that they would not take any further action with sanctions. Since France was prepared to give Abyssinia to Mussolini, his troops were able to continue their war relatively unchallenged by the rest of Europe.

Haile Selassie was forced into exile on 2 May. All of the sanctions that had been put in place by the League were dropped after the Italian capture of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on 5 May 1936. Ethiopia was then merged with the other Italian colonies to become Italian East Africa (&quot;Africa Orientale Italiana&quot;, or AOI).

Ethiopia never officially surrendered and pleaded for help from foreign nations, such as Haile Selassie&#x27;s . As a result, six nations did not recognize Italy&#x27;s occupation in 1937: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, Spain, Mexico and the United States. Italian control of Ethiopia was never total because of continued guerrilla activity, which the British would later use to their advantage during World War II.

==Aftermath==

The end of the AOI came quickly during World War II. In early 1941, as part of the East African Campaign, Allied forces launched offensive actions against the isolated Italian colony. On 5 May 1941, exactly five years after the Italians had captured his capital, Emperor Haile Selassie entered Addis Ababa.

There were also major impacts on the League of Nations:
* The Hoare-Laval Pact showed distrust of Britain and France toward the League.
* Hitler began reversing the Treaty of Versailles, such as by the Rhineland remilitarisation.
* Britain and France looked weaker still as seen by Germany, Italy and the United States.

<doc id="272387" wikidata="Q1399304" url="?curid=272387" title="Michael O'Kennedy">
<text>Michael O&#x27;Kennedy (21 February 1936 – 15 April 2022) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served in a range of cabinet positions, including Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Finance and Irish European Commissioner. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary North constituency and was also a member of Seanad Éireann.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Kennedy was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary, into a family that had strong links to Sinn Féin and the Old IRA. He was educated locally at St. Mary&#x27;s National School before later attending St Flannan&#x27;s College in Ennis, County Clare. He briefly studied for the priesthood at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, where he was a contemporary of future Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume. After securing first place in a university scholarship in 1953, O&#x27;Kennedy obtained an MA degree from University College Dublin. He taught in Switzerland for a while before resuming his legal studies; he was called to the Bar in 1961. Twelve years later, he was appointed Senior Counsel.

==Political career==
===Beginnings===
O&#x27;Kennedy joined Fianna Fáil in 1957 and became an active party member. He contested the 1965 general election in Tipperary North; however, he narrowly failed to win a seat. He was elected to the 11th Seanad, where he became the party spokesperson on various issues, including finance and education.

O&#x27;Kennedy contested the 1969 general election and was successful in securing a seat in Dáil Éireann. He remained on the backbenches until 1970 when the Arms Crisis resulted in a major reshuffle at cabinet and junior ministerial levels. O&#x27;Kennedy became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education.

In December 1972, a cabinet reshuffle by Taoiseach Jack Lynch saw O&#x27;Kennedy join the cabinet as minister without portfolio. There was much speculation as to what portfolio he would take; however, the new year saw him become Minister for Transport and Power. His tenure was short-lived, for the 1973 general election saw a Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government come to power.

Immediately after Fianna Fáil&#x27;s loss of power, O&#x27;Kennedy was appointed Spokesperson on Foreign Affairs. He retained the same brief in a 1975 front bench reshuffle. After this reshuffle, he revealed his future leadership aspirations as he became associated with a hardline policy document regarding Northern Ireland. The paper called for a complete and immediate withdrawal of the British Government from Northern Ireland. This new policy opened up the old divisions in Fianna Fáil that had come to light during the Arms Crisis in 1970. It was also against the party&#x27;s wishes and was at odds with party policy; however, O&#x27;Kennedy&#x27;s new policy was welcomed by the hardline Republican element at the grassroots level within the party.

===Cabinet minister and European commissioner===
The 1977 general election saw Fianna Fáil return to government with a twenty-seat majority in the Dáil. O&#x27;Kennedy was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Jack Lynch&#x27;s new cabinet.

In 1979, Lynch resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. The subsequent leadership election was a contest between George Colley and Charles Haughey. Colley was the favoured choice of the outgoing leadership and the majority of the cabinet, while Haughey had the backing of a large rump of backbench TDs who had become disillusioned with the party leadership. On the day before the crucial vote, O&#x27;Kennedy was the only cabinet minister to publicly endorse Haughey. Many believe that it was because of this support that Haughey was successful in becoming Taoiseach, albeit by a narrow margin of just six votes. O&#x27;Kennedy&#x27;s loyalty was rewarded when he was appointed Minister for Finance in the new government.

O&#x27;Kennedy&#x27;s tenure as Minister for Finance was short-lived, delivering a stringent budget, as he took the position of European commissioner in January 1981. Because of his new appointment in Brussels, he also resigned from his Dáil seat. O&#x27;Kennedy took over as European Commissioner for Personnel, Administration and the Statistics Office and was disappointed not to be made vice-president in the Thorn Commission. He was, however, made a delegate to the president.

O&#x27;Kennedy&#x27;s tenure in the European Commission was unhappy. He quickly grew bored of the mundane day-to-day work as a commissioner and missed the cut-and-thrust nature of Irish politics, which was going through a volatile period. A general election was called for February 1982, and O&#x27;Kennedy returned to contest his old seat. He was elected for Tipperary North once again and resigned as a European commissioner. O&#x27;Kennedy&#x27;s return was seen as an attempt to assert his claim to the future leadership of Fianna Fáil, something that had been a contentious issue under Haughey and his failure to secure an overall majority in two elections. Fianna Fáil returned to power with the help of several Independent TDs, and O&#x27;Kennedy demanded a senior government position. His request was refused. Haughey offered him the post of Attorney General, but O&#x27;Kennedy declined. As a result, he was left out of the short-lived administration.

The government fell in October that same year, and Fianna Fáil lost power at the subsequent general election. A period of instability followed within Fianna Fáil as several TDs attempted to oust Charles Haughey as party leader. Desmond O&#x27;Malley was seen as the clear front-runner to succeed Haughey; however, O&#x27;Kennedy&#x27;s name was also mentioned alongside other party stalwarts like Gerry Collins and Brian Lenihan. In the end, Haughey survived as party leader.

===Return to cabinet===
Following the 1987 general election, Haughey was again Taoiseach and O&#x27;Kennedy returned to the cabinet as Minister for Agriculture and Food. This may have seemed like a demotion for someone with the experience of O&#x27;Kennedy; however, his nearly five-year tenure received praise from farming circles.

In November 1991, tensions arose within Fianna Fáil regarding the continued leadership of Haughey. Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds directly challenged the party leader and Taoiseach; however, the challenge failed. O&#x27;Kennedy supported the incumbent leader throughout the heave and took over as Minister for Labour in the subsequent reshuffle. Once again, this was viewed as a demotion; however, O&#x27;Kennedy viewed his role as one of the most important in the cabinet, considering the high unemployment rate.

In February 1992, Haughey stepped down as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader, and Albert Reynolds won the subsequent leadership election by a large majority. The formation of his new cabinet caused widespread shock as O&#x27;Kennedy and seven of his cabinet colleagues were effectively sacked in favour of supporters of the new Taoiseach. This brought his cabinet career to an end.

===Later years===
O&#x27;Kennedy lost his seat at the 1992 general election, in what turned out to be a disaster for Fianna Fáil. He subsequently secured election to Seanad Éireann for the second time in his career.

O&#x27;Kennedy was re-elected to the Dáil at the 1997 general election. He sought the Fianna Fáil nomination in the 1997 presidential election, but received only 21 votes out of a total of 112, as Mary McAleese became the party&#x27;s nominee and eventual victor of the election.

After the 2002 general election, O&#x27;Kennedy retired from national politics. He returned to work as a barrister and subsequently became a member of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.

O&#x27;Kennedy died on 15 April 2022, aged 86.

<doc id="272456" wikidata="Q1545619" url="?curid=272456" title="Aspect ratio (aeronautics)">
<text>In aeronautics, the aspect ratio of a wing is the ratio of its span to its mean chord. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.

Aspect ratio and other features of the planform are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the lift-to-drag ratio increases with aspect ratio, improving the fuel economy in powered airplanes and the gliding angle of sailplanes.

== Definition ==
The aspect ratio formula_1 is the ratio of the square of the wingspan formula_2 to the projected wing area formula_3, which is equal to the ratio of the wingspan formula_2 to the standard mean chord formula_5:

formula_6

== Mechanism ==
As a useful simplification, an airplane in flight can be imagined to affect a cylinder of air with a diameter equal to the wingspan. A large wingspan affects a large cylinder of air, and a small wingspan affects a small cylinder of air. A small air cylinder must be pushed down with a greater power (energy change per unit time) than a large cylinder in order to produce an equal upward force (momentum change per unit time). This is because giving the same momentum change to a smaller mass of air requires giving it a greater velocity change, and a much greater energy change because energy is proportional to the square of the velocity while momentum is only linearly proportional to the velocity. The aft-leaning component of this change in velocity is proportional to the induced drag, which is the force needed to take up that power at that airspeed.

It is important to keep in mind that this is a drastic oversimplification, and an airplane wing affects a very large area around itself.

==In aircraft==


Although a long, narrow wing with a high aspect ratio has aerodynamic advantages like better lift-to-drag-ratio (see also details below), there are several reasons why not &quot;all&quot; aircraft have high aspect-ratio wings:

* Structural: A long wing has higher bending stress for a given load than a short one and therefore requires higher structural-design (architectural and/or material) specifications. Also, longer wings may have some torsion for a given load, and in some applications this torsion is undesirable (e.g. if the warped wing interferes with aileron effect).
* Maneuverability: a low aspect-ratio wing will have a higher roll angular acceleration than one with high aspect ratio, because a high aspect-ratio wing has a higher moment of inertia to overcome. In a steady roll, the longer wing gives a higher roll moment because of the longer moment arm of the aileron. Low aspect-ratio wings are usually used on fighter aircraft, not only for the higher roll rates, but especially for longer chord and thinner airfoils involved in supersonic flight.
* Parasitic drag: While high aspect wings create less induced drag, they have greater parasitic drag (drag due to shape, frontal area, and surface friction). This is because, for an equal wing &quot;area&quot;, the average chord (length in the direction of wind travel over the wing) is smaller. Due to the effects of Reynolds number, the value of the section drag coefficient is an inverse logarithmic function of the characteristic length of the surface, which means that, even if two wings of the same area are flying at equal speeds and equal angles of attack, the section drag coefficient is slightly higher on the wing with the smaller chord. However, this variation is very small when compared to the variation in induced drag with changing wingspan.For example, the section drag coefficient formula_7 of a NACA 23012 airfoil (at typical lift coefficients) is inversely proportional to chord length to the power 0.129: formula_8 
:A 20% increase in chord length would decrease the section drag coefficient by 2.38%.
* Practicality: low aspect ratios have a greater useful internal volume, since the maximum thickness is greater, which can be used to house the fuel tanks, retractable landing gear and other systems.
* Airfield size: Airfields, hangars, and other ground equipment define a maximum wingspan, which cannot be exceeded. To generate enough lift at a given wingspan, the aircraft designer must increase wing area by lengthening the chord, thus lowering the aspect ratio. This limits the Airbus A380 to 80m wide with an aspect ratio of 7.8, while the Boeing 787 or Airbus A350 have an aspect ratio of 9.5, influencing flight economy.

===Variable aspect ratio===

Aircraft which approach or exceed the speed of sound sometimes incorporate variable-sweep wings. These wings give a high aspect ratio when unswept and a low aspect ratio at maximum sweep.

In subsonic flow, steeply swept and narrow wings are inefficient compared to a high-aspect-ratio wing. However, as the flow becomes transonic and then supersonic, the shock wave first generated along the wing&#x27;s upper surface causes wave drag on the aircraft, and this drag is proportional to the span of the wing. Thus a long span, valuable at low speeds, causes excessive drag at transonic and supersonic speeds.

By varying the sweep the wing can be optimised for the current flight speed. However, the extra weight and complexity of a moveable wing mean that such a system is not included in many designs.

==Birds and bats==

The aspect ratios of birds&#x27; and bats&#x27; wings vary considerably. Birds that fly long distances or spend long periods soaring such as albatrosses and eagles often have wings of high aspect ratio. By contrast, birds which require good maneuverability, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, have wings of low aspect ratio.

==Details==
For a constant-chord wing of chord &quot;c&quot; and span &quot;b&quot;, the aspect ratio is given by:
:formula_9

If the wing is swept, &quot;c&quot; is measured parallel to the direction of forward flight.

For most wings the length of the chord is not a constant but varies along the wing, so the aspect ratio &quot;AR&quot; is defined as the square of the wingspan &quot;b&quot; divided by the wing area &quot;S&quot;. In symbols,
:formula_10.

For such a wing with varying chord, the standard mean chord &quot;SMC&quot; is defined as 
:formula_11

The performance of aspect ratio AR related to the lift-to-drag-ratio and wingtip vortices is illustrated in the formula used to calculate the drag coefficient of an aircraft formula_12

:formula_13

where

===Wetted aspect ratio===
The wetted aspect ratio considers the whole wetted surface area of the airframe, formula_14, rather than just the wing. It is a better measure of the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft than the wing aspect ratio. It is defined as:

:formula_15

where formula_2 is span and formula_14 is the wetted surface.

Illustrative examples are provided by the Boeing B-47 and Avro Vulcan. Both aircraft have very similar performance although they are radically different. The B-47 has a high aspect ratio wing, while the Avro Vulcan has a low aspect ratio wing. They have, however, a very similar wetted aspect ratio.

<text>Low-power broadcasting is broadcasting by a broadcast station at a low transmitter power output to a smaller service area than &quot;full power&quot; stations within the same region. It is often distinguished from &quot;micropower broadcasting&quot; (more commonly &quot;microbroadcasting&quot;) and broadcast translators. LPAM, LPFM and LPTV are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the laws and their enforcement.
==Canada==
Radio communications in Canada are regulated by the Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, a branch of Industry Canada, in conjunction with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Interested parties must apply for both a certificate from Industry Canada and a license from CRTC in order to operate a radio station. Industry Canada manages the technicalities of spectrum space and technological requirements whereas content regulation is conducted more so by CRTC.

LPAM stations are authorized to operate with less than 100 watts of power.

LPFM is broken up into two classes in Canada, Low (50 watts) and Very Low (10 watts). The transmitters therefore range from 1 to 50 watts, as opposed to 1 to 100 watts in the U.S. , 500 licenses (very low and low-power FM) have been issued. These transmitters are generally only allowed in remote areas.

Stations in the low-power class are subject to the same CRTC licensing requirements, and will generally follow the same call sign format, as full-power stations. Stations in the very low-power class formerly had to have CRTC licenses as well, although a series of CRTC regulation changes in the early 2000s exempted most such stations from licensing; a station in this class will usually not have a conventional call sign, but will instead be identified in a naming format consisting of a four-digit number preceded by the letters CH for a television station or VF for a radio station.

The regulation of spectrum space is strict in Canada, as well having restrictions on second and third adjacent channels, along with other protections for AM and FM commercial radio. In addition, because there have been a few cases that found that FM frequencies have caused interference to the aeronautical navigation and communications (NAV/COM) spectrum (though evidence is not very concrete presently), pirate radio regulation has remained very strict as well. However, the two regulating bodies do have certain exemptions. For example, low-power announcement transmitters that meet the requirement of Broadcasting Equipment Technical Standards 1, Limited Duration Special Events Distribution Undertakings, Temporary Resource Development Distribution Undertakings, and Public Emergency Radio Undertakings are a few instances, which according to certain criteria, may be exempt from certificate/license requirements.

A television station is considered very low power if its power does not exceed 2 watts for a VHF station, or 10 watts for a UHF station. Low-power analog &amp; digital television stations are authorized to operate with up to 50 watts in VHF, or 500 watts for a UHF station.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand residents are allowed a broadcast license (free-of-charge) at a maximum of 1 watt EIRP in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7 MHz under a General User Radio License (GURL), which is issued by Radio Spectrum Management, managed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500 mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour.

Further restrictions are in place for the protection of aeronautical services. Use of the following frequencies is not permitted within certain boundaries approaching Auckland and Wellington airports: 107.5 to 107.7, and 107.0 to 107.3 MHz, respectively.

There exists a 25 km broadcast translator rule: one licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25 km away from at least one of the first two transmitters.

There are efforts on self-regulation of the broadcasters themselves. The NZRSM Radio Inspectors do, however, regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection.

==United Kingdom==

Temporary low-power stations are allowed at times via a Restricted Service Licence. Since 2001, long-term LPFM licenses have been available in remote areas of the country. These are currently used for many establishments, including military bases, universities and hospitals with fixed boundaries. On the 18th of June 2021, Ofcom (Office of Communications) began a trial of expanding the number of LPFM stations in the United Kingdom by issuing licenses to broadcast to many more hospitals and military bases. This was done in order to see if such broadcasts could be feasibly achieved in events where they would be needed without interfering with other broadcasts.

==United States==
===FM radio===
Low Power FM (LPFM) is a non-commercial educational broadcast radio service created by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States in 2000. LPFM licenses, which are limited to a maximum effective radiated power (ERP) of 100 watts, may be issued to non-commercial educational entities, as well as public safety and transportation organizations. Individuals and holders of other types of broadcast licenses are not eligible. In addition, LPFM stations are not protected from interference from other classes of FM stations.

====LPFM classes====
* Class L1 (LP100) is to 100 watts effective radiated power (ERP). ()
* Class L2 (L10) is at least 1 and up to 10 watts ERP. ()

In addition, Class D educational licenses exist for stations of 10 watts transmitter power output (TPO) or less, regardless of ERP. These stations are all grandfathered operations, as no new licenses of this type have been issued since 1978, except in Alaska. They are not considered to be LPFM stations, although they operate noncommercially and have similar coverage areas to Class L2 stations.

====Legislation====

=====Origins of LPFM=====
In January 2000, the Federal Communications Commission established Low Power FM (LPFM) as a new designated class of radio station. These stations were allowed to operate at 1–10 or 50–100 watts of power, compared to the minimum requirement for commercial stations at 100 watts. (). Originally, it was supported by activists and groups associated with American progressivism; music artists (such as Bonnie Raitt); religious leaders/churches (such as the United Church of Christ); and educators (for example, American Library Association, the Communication Workers of America labor union, the National League of Cities).

The original purpose of LPFM was to serve as an alternative to &quot;radio homogenization&quot;, described in 2001 in the &quot;J &amp; MC Quarterly&quot;, as &quot;... Necessary to offset the growing consolidation of station ownership in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed caps on radio ownership, as well as the decline of locally produced radio programming.&quot; The main opposition to LPFMs came from the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), which opposed the act on grounds to &quot;maintain spectrum integrity&quot; for commercial broadcasting, according to NAB President Edward O. Fritts.

=====Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000=====
Pressure from the National Association of Broadcasters urged Congress to slip the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 into a general spending bill then moving through Congress. President Bill Clinton signed the bill in December 2000. The bill passed by Congress (H.R.567) was meant to tighten standards for LPFM stations, making it harder for them to be approved, to protect full-power FM stations through certain provisions:
# The FCC has the ability and jurisdiction to license LPFM stations.
# Third adjacent channel interference protections require LPFM stations to be separated by at least 0.6 MHz from all other stations, to prevent signal interference.
# Applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station cannot receive LPFM licenses.
# The FCC agreed to commission studies on the interference by, and economic impact of, LPFM on full-power stations (the findings, later published in the &quot;MITRE Corporation Report&quot;, suggest that third adjacent channel interference protections may not be necessary).

This act shifted policy making from the FCC to Congress, which was considered an insult against the FCC.

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2005=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2005 was introduced by Senators John McCain, Maria Cantwell and Patrick Leahy. After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning the MITRE Report to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full-power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and would not have a significant effect on other stations. According to Sen. Leahy, &quot;This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind.&quot;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2007=====
Sponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressmen Mike Doyle and Lee Terry and in the United States Senate by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 never came to a vote. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007. Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as &quot;Never Passed&quot;.

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2009=====
This bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It would have required the FCC to alter current rules by removing the minimum frequency separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent channel stations. Previously, there was a minimum frequency separation; however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.

The Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also would have required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a radio reading service (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired). This protection will ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.

The final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make sure that these licenses are also available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions are made with regard to local community needs. The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership. It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2010=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon the legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011, as , after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski said, &quot;Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country.&quot; The Act states that the Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, should ensure that licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.

In general, the FCC was to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum frequency separation requirements between low-power FM stations; and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.

====Arguments for LPFM====
*Free Press, a non-partisan advocacy organization pushing for media reform, promoting &quot;diversity and independent media ownership, strong public media, and universal access to communications,&quot; voiced its support of LPFM for a variety of reasons:
** It strengthens community identity.
** It creates an outlet for amateur musicians to have their music heard.
** It promotes diversity on the air because more women and racial minorities are represented.
** It creates an opportunity for young people, especially college students, who are interested in radio to learn about the business.
** It provides farmers with up to date agricultural information.
*Prometheus Radio Project, a non-profit organization that &quot;builds, supports, and advocates for community radio stations which empower participatory community voices and movements for social change,&quot; also supported LPFM, citing these reasons:
** The media should not limit democratic participation but should provide a way for communities and movements to express themselves
** Public airwaves shouldn&#x27;t be concentrated in private/corporate hands
** Low Power FM gives a voice to communities
** Low Power FM needs to be protected from big broadcasters

A &quot;New York Times&quot; article focusing on a LPFM station, KOCZ-LP, highlights a number of key arguments favoring low-powered broadcasting:
* &quot;In Louisiana, a large African-American community appreciates how LPFM plays a genre of music called zydeco, a potent blend of Cajun, rhythm and blues and, among a younger generation, hip-hop, often features accordion and washboard.“
* LPFM influences commercial radio to offer listeners a wider range of music. &quot;Commercial stations had started playing more zydeco since KOCZ started broadcasting in 2002. &#x27;They know that we make them better,&#x27; an advocate said.&quot;
* Because LPFM is non-commercial, schools and organizations are able to promote many projects that help serve the local community. &quot;KOCZ is licensed to the Southern Development Foundation, a civil rights group that grants scholarships and runs a business incubator but has fallen on hard times. The foundation treats the station as a 24-hour form of community outreach. &quot;
* LPFM promotes a very close community. &quot;A woman walked into the station ... asked for an announcement to be broadcast about her lost dog... &#x27;She was able to get her dog back the next day’”
* LPFM is crucial for small communities in times of emergencies. “A low power FM radio station can stay on the air even if the power goes out. Low power FM saved lives during Katrina.”

Former President Bill Clinton has also become an advocate of LPFM for &quot;giving voice to the voiceless&quot;, including schools, community-based organizations, churches, and ethnic groups.

Brown Paper Tickets CEO Steve Butcher supports LPFM, stating in a letter to the FCC, &quot;We hear from event producers frequently who can&#x27;t afford radio ad buys on commercial stations. These local entrepreneurs can afford underwriting on smaller stations that can help build awareness about their events.&quot;

LPFM stations are considered to be affordable compared to an average FM station, whose operating costs can run up to a million dollars, and could only afforded by businesses and the very wealthy. An antenna and transmitter can cost between $2,000 and $5,000.

====Arguments against LPFM====
* Signal interference on FM station – High-power FM stations express concern that LPFM stations may cause interference with their signals if third adjacent-channel interference protections are not observed. While the Mitre Report suggests that the likelihood for interference is not as threatening as previously thought, high-power FM stations question the methodology, scope and validity of the study and its results.
* FM translators – These devices allow a radio station to rebroadcast its signal to reach a greater area. FM translators could benefit religious broadcasters wishing to reach a larger audience, as well as many AM radio stations who, due to ionospheric refraction, are required to emit weaker signals during the night. FM translators are low-power, so compete with LPFM for limited space on the airwaves.
* In some states, the local Department of Transportation operates large networks of LPFM stations that act as highway advisory radio stations – a service traditionally operated at the fringes of the AM band – restricting the number of available channels (these systems can be licensed to the entire AM band, but the LPFM service provides considerably greater coverage at 100 watts than the 10-watt limit on AM – hence the considerable appeal for government agencies).
* Some investors in radio believe LPFM services prevent the development of digital radio.
* NPR is a major opponent to low-power FM. Their stance is that allowing more flexible rules for LPFM would burden other stations by forcing them to deal with interference problems and because full-power broadcasters reach a broader audience and provide a greater service, they should be favored regarding spectrum availability.
* The National Association of Broadcasters is the other major source of opposition. Its stance is that full-power FM broadcasters “enhance localism” by providing community-responsive information such as emergency information. Allowing low-power FM stations to have equal spectrum rights could be detrimental to these necessary programs.

====LPFM vs. broadcast translators====

Unlike the former FM class D license, an LPFM station has no priority over broadcast translators in the allocation of available spectrum. This is problematic insofar as the regulations for broadcast translators exempts non-commercial stations from the requirement that translators be within the coverage area of the original station that they rebroadcast. However, this provision only affects translators in the non-commercial portion of the band. Stations in the commercial part of the spectrum must be fed over the air unless they are within the actual service area of the primary station. Since the translator window of 2003 was only open for commercial channels, the use of directly-fed via satellite FM translators, commonly called &quot;Satellators&quot;, was never a factor in the 2003 window.

The FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed, most of them coming from a few religious broadcasters. However even though all translators on commercial frequencies must be fed by a direct, over-the-air source, regardless of who owns the translator per FCC rule 74.1231(b), the actual over-the-air source (the primary station) can be satellite fed, just as commercial stations can be fed by satellite. This leads to programming from a single station (retransmitted by many others) ending up on several hundred different translators. One station cannot apply for hundreds or thousands of translators nationwide, using automated means to generate license applications for all available channels, unless all of their applications are exclusively on the non-commercial part of the broadcast band (88–91.9 MHz). () As with any new service that shares the FM spectrum, when translators are added to an area, they can reduce or eliminate the availability of channels both for new LPFM applicants and for relocation of any existing LPFM stations displaced by full-service broadcasters. Unlike an LPFM station, a translator is not required to (and legally not authorized to) originate any local content except as permitted by . Thus there is competition for spectrum in some locations between the LPFM service and the FM translator service.

In May 2018, several groups supporting community-based low-power FM stations filed objections with the FCC, citing the Local Community Radio Act, accusing it of favoring existing station coverage expansion with translator licenses - &quot;a spectrum grab&quot; - over new LPFM spectrum licenses.

===AM radio===

The acronym &#x27;LPAM&#x27; is not a legal term in the United States and is only used as an acronym. Unlike LPFM stations, which have legal and regulatory status, FCC rules do not define &quot;LPAM&quot; nor issue licenses for low-power AM transmission. LPAM is only an acronym applied to licensed low-power AM operations and to Part 15 transmissions as well.

Any use of the term &quot;low power AM&quot; in FCC licensing for United States stations is the requirement for higher-power licensed AM stations to reduce their transmit power at nighttime – post-sunset / pre-sunrise – as a condition of their high-power broadcast authorization. There is a category &quot;class D&quot; for AM broadcast licenses, which limited stations to daytime-only transmission before regulations changed in the 1980s. Many, but not all, class D stations have been granted authority to broadcast at night with enough power to be heard within a few miles of their transmitters.

Other LPAM operations are known as Travelers&#x27; Information Stations (TIS), sometimes also called highway advisory radio (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as national parks. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations.

Music is not allowed on TIS/HAR stations, and they are restricted to only 3 kHz wide, &quot;low-fidelity audio&quot;, compared to the 10 kHz audio for standard AM broadcasters and 15 kHz audio permitted on FM stations. (Modern AM stations in the US actually restrict their audio from 5 kHz down to 2.5 kHz - roughly the same as to TIS stations. TIS transmissions are normally authorized for 10 watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60–watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680 kHz at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport have the highest licensed power among full-time TIS stations.

===Television===

There are more than 2,450 licensed low-power television (LPTV) stations in the U.S., which are located in markets of all sizes, from New York City (five stations, though more exist in the market from other cities of license) down to Junction City, Kansas (two stations).

LPTV (-LP) and LPTV Digital (-LD) are common in the U.S., Canada and most of the Americas, where most stations originate their own programming. Stations that do not originate their own programming are designated as translators (-TX). The Community Broadcasters Act of 1998 directed the FCC to create a classification of LPTV licenses called Class A (-CA) and Class A Digital (-CD). Digital low-power and Class-A television stations have an ERP limit of 3,000 watts (3 kW) for VHF, and 15 kilowatts for UHF.

The LPTV service is considered a secondary service by the FCC, which means the licensee is not guaranteed protection from interference or displacement. An LPTV station must accept harmful interference from full-service television stations and may not cause harmful interference to any full-service television station (the FCC defines interference levels deemed to be &quot;harmful&quot;). The problem with potential displacement was made evident during the transition of broadcasting in the United States from analog to digital. All television stations operating on UHF channels 38 and above were required to move to channel 36 or below. Full-service stations were guaranteed a place to land in the new compressed band while LPTV stations operating on channels 38 and above were required to either enter a channel-sharing agreement with another station or lose their license.

====Class A LPTV stations====
The FCC provided a one-time filing opportunity for existing LPTV stations to become Class A stations. The designation was only available to LPTV stations that were producing two hours per week of local programming. Class A stations had to maintain a production studio within their Grade B contour, and comply with many of the requirements placed on full-service television stations. This allowed them to obtain protected channel status.

====Must-carry====
One of the key distinctions between full-service television stations and low-power stations is cable television and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) carriage. Full-service stations are guaranteed carriage in their local television market through &quot;must-carry&quot; whereas LPTV stations are not. In 2008, there was an effort put forward by FCC chairman Kevin Martin to grant must-carry rights to Class A LPTV stations. The effort failed due to a lack of support from the other FCC commissioners.

====Network affiliates====
Though many low-power television stations are either unaffiliated, or broadcast programming from small networks meant for their use, some LPTV stations are affiliated with minor broadcast networks like The CW or MyNetworkTV. Examples include in Boston, Massachusetts with NBC on WBTS-CD; Youngstown, Ohio, where a pair of LPTV stations based at WYFX-LD broadcast Fox programming, along with the digital subchannel of the co-owned CBS affiliate, WKBN-TV; or in the Lima, Ohio area, whose low-power stations are affiliates of major networks, such as CBS and ABC.

====Digital transition====

On July 15, 2011, the FCC issued an order to low-power broadcasters that effectively required all remaining television transmitters to vacate channels 52 to 69 by December 31, 2011. Originally, all low power analog TV stations were required to shut off by September 1, 2015, however, the deadline for low-power television stations and translators was postponed due to a spectrum auction that took place. While Class-A television stations were required to sign off on September 1, 2015, the last remaining low-powered analog television stations had signed off by July 13, 2021.

Unlike AM and FM, unlicensed use of television bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The amateur television channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some repeaters airing NASA TV during Space Shuttle missions when they are not in local use.

The low-power television industry was represented by the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), which held its annual convention each year in October and an annual meeting each year in April at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention in Las Vegas. The meeting was open to anyone interested in the low-power television industry. On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the &quot;restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential&quot;. Another was the inability to reach most viewers, partly due to multichannel video programming distributors refusing to carry these channels. In addition, Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, &quot;some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition.&quot;

In February 2006, the FCC released its Notices of Proposed Rules for Digital Radio. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to provide broadcasters with the opportunity to take advantage of digital audio broadcasting (DAB) technology, proposed criteria for evaluating models and systems, such as the In-band on-channel (IBOC) system, and inquired on the needs for a mandatory DAB transmission standard.

In section 39 of the Notice, the FCC inquires as how to balance incentives for broadcasters to switch to digital systems with incumbents of new entrance opportunities, stating that they “seek analyses of the minimum power levels that would preserve service within protected service areas in an all-digital environment, and alternatively, the levels that would not result in significant disruptions to current listening patterns.”

The DAB system that was identified as the best fit for LPFM was IBOC. This hybrid system uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the digital carriers require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. , imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.

<doc id="272483" wikidata="Q1295986" url="?curid=272483" title="Effective radiated power">
<text>Effective radiated power (ERP), synonymous with equivalent radiated power, is an IEEE standardized definition of directional radio frequency (RF) power, such as that emitted by a radio transmitter. It is the total power in watts that would have to be radiated by a half-wave dipole antenna to give the same radiation intensity (signal strength or power flux density in watts per square meter) as the actual source antenna at a distant receiver located in the direction of the antenna&#x27;s strongest beam (main lobe). ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction. It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna. It is used in electronics and telecommunications, particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area.
An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). Effective isotropic radiated power is the hypothetical power that would have to be radiated by an isotropic antenna to give the same (&quot;equivalent&quot;) signal strength as the actual source antenna in the direction of the antenna&#x27;s strongest beam. The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna, while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna. Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64 (or 2.15 dB) compared to an isotropic radiator, if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is
formula_1
If they are expressed in decibels
formula_2

== Definitions ==
Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both measure the power density a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of electromagnetic waves) radiate in a specific direction: in the direction of maximum signal strength (the &quot;main lobe&quot;) of its radiation pattern.
This apparent power is dependent on two factors: The total power output and the radiation pattern of the antenna – how much of that power is radiated in the direction of maximal intensity. The latter factor is quantified by the antenna gain, which is the ratio of the signal strength radiated by an antenna in its direction of maximum radiation to that radiated by a standard antenna. For example, a 1,000 watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 4× (equiv. 6 dBi) will have the same signal strength in the direction of its main lobe, and thus the same ERP and EIRP, as a 4,000 watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1× (equiv. 0 dBi). So ERP and EIRP are measures of radiated power that can compare different combinations of transmitters and antennas on an equal basis.

In spite of the names, ERP and EIRP do not measure transmitter power, or total power radiated by the antenna, they are just a measure of signal strength along the main lobe. They give no information about power radiated in other directions, or total power. ERP and EIRP are always greater than the actual total power radiated by the antenna.

The difference between ERP and EIRP is that antenna gain has traditionally been measured in two different units, comparing the antenna to two different standard antennas; an isotropic antenna and a half-wave dipole antenna:

* &quot;Isotropic gain&quot; is the ratio of the power density formula_3 (signal strength in watts per square meter) received at a point far from the antenna (in the far field) in the direction of its maximum radiation (main lobe), to the power formula_4 received at the same point from a hypothetical lossless isotropic antenna, which radiates equal power in all directions formula_5 Gain is often expressed in logarithmic units of decibels (dB). The decibel gain relative to an isotropic antenna (dB) is given by
: formula_6

* &quot;Dipole gain&quot; is the ratio of the power density received from the antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation to the power density formula_7 received from a lossless half-wave dipole antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation formula_8 The decibel gain relative to a dipole (dB) is given by formula_9
In contrast to an isotropic antenna, the dipole has a &quot;donut-shaped&quot; radiation pattern, its radiated power is maximum in directions perpendicular to the antenna, declining to zero on the antenna axis. Since the radiation of the dipole is concentrated in horizontal directions, the gain of a half-wave dipole is greater than that of an isotropic antenna. The isotropic gain of a half-wave dipole is 1.64, or in decibels formula_10 so
formula_11
In decibels
formula_12

The two measures EIRP and ERP are based on the two different standard antennas above:

* EIRP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless isotropic antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter&#x27;s antenna multiplied by the isotropic antenna gain formula_13 The ERP and EIRP are also often expressed in decibels (dB). The input power in decibels is usually calculated with comparison to a reference level of one watt (W): formula_14 Since multiplication of two factors is equivalent to addition of their decibel values formula_15

* ERP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless half-wave dipole antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter&#x27;s antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave dipole: formula_16 In decibels formula_17

Since the two definitions of gain only differ by a constant factor, so do ERP and EIRP
formula_18
In decibels
formula_19

== Relation to transmitter output power ==
The transmitter is usually connected to the antenna through a transmission line and impedance matching network. Since these components may have significant losses formula_20 the power applied to the antenna is usually less than the output power of the transmitter formula_21 The relation of ERP and EIRP to transmitter output power is
formula_22
formula_23
Losses in the antenna itself are included in the gain.

== Relation to signal strength ==
If the signal path is in free space (line-of-sight propagation with no multipath) the signal strength (power flux density in watts per square meter) formula_24 of the radio signal on the main lobe axis at any particular distance formula_25 from the antenna can be calculated from the EIRP or ERP. Since an isotropic antenna radiates equal power flux density over a sphere centered on the antenna, and the area of a sphere with radius formula_26 is formula_27 then
formula_28
Since formula_29
formula_30
After dividing out the factor of formula_31 we get:
formula_32

However, if the radio waves travel by ground wave as is typical for medium or longwave broadcasting, skywave, or indirect paths play a part in transmission, the waves will suffer additional attenuation which depends on the terrain between the antennas, so these formulas are not valid.

== Dipole vs. isotropic radiators ==
Because ERP is calculated as antenna gain (in a given direction) as compared with the maximum directivity of a half-wave dipole antenna, it creates a mathematically virtual effective dipole antenna oriented in the direction of the receiver. In other words, a notional receiver in a given direction from the transmitter would receive the same power if the source were replaced with an ideal dipole oriented with maximum directivity and matched polarization towards the receiver and with an antenna input power equal to the ERP. The receiver would not be able to determine a difference. Maximum directivity of an ideal half-wave dipole is a constant, i.e., Therefore, ERP is always 2.15 dB less than EIRP. The ideal dipole antenna could be further replaced by an isotropic radiator (a purely mathematical device which cannot exist in the real world), and the receiver cannot know the difference so long as the input power is increased by 2.15 dB.

The distinction between dB and dB is often left unstated and the reader is sometimes forced to infer which was used. For example, a Yagi–Uda antenna is constructed from several dipoles arranged at precise intervals to create greater energy focusing (directivity) than a simple dipole. Since it is constructed from dipoles, often its antenna gain is expressed in dB, but listed only as dB. This ambiguity is undesirable with respect to engineering specifications. A Yagi–Uda antenna&#x27;s maximum directivity is Its gain necessarily must be less than this by the factor η, which must be negative in units of dB. Neither ERP nor EIRP can be calculated without knowledge of the power accepted by the antenna, i.e., it is not correct to use units of dB or dB with ERP and EIRP. Let us assume a 100 watt (20 dB) transmitter with losses of 6 dB prior to the antenna. ERP &lt; 22.77 dB and EIRP &lt; 24.92 dB, both less than ideal by in dB. Assuming that the receiver is in the first side-lobe of the transmitting antenna, and each value is further reduced by 7.2 dB, which is the decrease in directivity from the main to side-lobe of a Yagi–Uda. Therefore, anywhere along the side-lobe direction from this transmitter, a blind receiver could not tell the difference if a Yagi–Uda was replaced with either an ideal dipole (oriented towards the receiver) or an isotropic radiator with antenna input power increased by 1.57 dB.

== Polarization ==
Polarization has not been taken into account so far, but it must be properly clarified. When considering the dipole radiator previously we assumed that it was perfectly aligned with the receiver. Now assume, however, that the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, and there will be a minimum 3 dB polarization loss &quot;regardless&quot; of antenna orientation. If the receiver is also a dipole, it is possible to align it orthogonally to the transmitter such that theoretically zero energy is received. However, this polarization loss is not accounted for in the calculation of ERP or EIRP. Rather, the receiving system designer must account for this loss as appropriate. For example, a cellular telephone tower has a fixed linear polarization, but the mobile handset must function well at any arbitrary orientation. Therefore, a handset design might provide dual polarization receive on the handset so that captured energy is maximized regardless of orientation, or the designer might use a circularly polarized antenna and account for the extra 3 dB of loss with amplification.

== FM example ==

For example, an FM radio station which advertises that it has 100,000 watts of power actually has 100,000 watts ERP, and &quot;not&quot; an actual 100,000-watt transmitter. The transmitter power output (TPO) of such a station typically may be 10,000–20,000 watts, with a gain factor of 5–10× (5–10×, or 7–10 dB). In most antenna designs, gain is realized primarily by concentrating power toward the horizontal plane and suppressing it at upward and downward angles, through the use of phased arrays of antenna elements. The distribution of power versus elevation angle is known as the &quot;vertical pattern&quot;. When an antenna is also directional horizontally, gain and ERP will vary with azimuth (compass direction). Rather than the average power over all directions, it is the apparent power in the direction of the peak of the antenna&#x27;s main lobe that is quoted as a station&#x27;s ERP (this statement is just another way of stating the definition of ERP). This is particularly applicable to the huge ERPs reported for shortwave broadcasting stations, which use very narrow beam widths to get their signals across continents and oceans.

=== United States regulatory usage ===
ERP for FM radio in the United States is always relative to a theoretical reference half-wave dipole antenna. (That is, when calculating ERP, the most direct approach is to work with antenna gain in dB). To deal with antenna polarization, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lists ERP in both the horizontal and vertical measurements for FM and TV. Horizontal is the standard for both, but if the vertical ERP is larger it will be used instead.

The maximum ERP for US FM broadcasting is usually 100,000 watts (FM Zone II) or 50,000 watts (in the generally more densely populated Zones I and I-A), though exact restrictions vary depending on the class of license and the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT). Some stations have been grandfathered in or, very infrequently, been given a waiver, and can exceed normal restrictions.

== Microwave band issues ==
For most microwave systems, a completely non-directional isotropic antenna (one which radiates equally and perfectly well in every direction – a physical impossibility) is used as a reference antenna, and then one speaks of EIRP (effective &quot;isotropic&quot; radiated power) rather than ERP. This includes satellite transponders, radar, and other systems which use microwave dishes and reflectors rather than dipole-style antennas.

== Lower-frequency issues ==
In the case of medium wave (AM) stations in the United States, power limits are set to the actual transmitter power output, and ERP is not used in normal calculations. Omnidirectional antennas used by a number of stations radiate the signal equally in all horizontal directions. Directional arrays are used to protect co- or adjacent channel stations, usually at night, but some run directionally continuously. While antenna efficiency and ground conductivity are taken into account when designing such an array, the FCC database shows the station&#x27;s transmitter power output, not ERP.

== Related terms ==
According to the Institution of Electrical Engineers (UK), ERP is often used as a general reference term for radiated power, but strictly speaking should only be used when the antenna is a half-wave dipole, and is used when referring to FM transmission.

===EMRP===
Effective monopole radiated power (EMRP) may be used in Europe, particularly in relation to medium wave broadcasting antennas. This is the same as ERP, except that a short vertical antenna (i.e. a short monopole) is used as the reference antenna instead of a half-wave dipole.

===CMF===
Cymomotive force (CMF) is an alternative term used for expressing radiation intensity in volts, particularly at the lower frequencies. It is used in Australian legislation regulating AM broadcasting services, which describes it as: &quot;for a transmitter, [it] means the product, expressed in volts, of:
: (a) the electric field strength at a given point in space, due to the operation of the transmitter; and
: (b) the distance of that point from the transmitter&#x27;s antenna&quot;.

It relates to AM broadcasting only, and expresses the field strength in &quot;microvolts per metre at a distance of 1 kilometre from the transmitting antenna&quot;.

== HAAT ==

The height above average terrain for VHF and higher frequencies is extremely important when considering ERP, as the signal coverage (broadcast range) produced by a given ERP dramatically increases with antenna height. Because of this, it is possible for a station of only a few hundred watts ERP to cover more area than a station of a few thousand watts ERP, if its signal travels above obstructions on the ground.

<text>Kingfisher plc is a British multinational retailing company headquartered in London, England.

It has over 1,300 stores in nine countries, and its brands include B&amp;Q, Castorama, Brico Dépôt and Screwfix. Kingfisher is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1982 as Paternoster Stores Ltd, to conduct a buyout of the British Woolworths chain. In March 1983, Paternoster changed its name to Woolworth Holdings plc. Woolworths already owned B&amp;Q, and the company expanded through subsequent acquisitions of companies such as Superdrug and Comet.

The business acquired Screwfix in July 1999, which is now the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest multi channel retailer of trade tools, accessories and hardware products. The company was led from January 1984, until his retirement in December 2002, by Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy. Largely through his influence, the company became the major sponsor of British sailor Ellen MacArthur.

Woolworth Holdings was renamed Kingfisher plc in December 1989. Further acquisitions included European companies such as Castorama, BUT S.A. and Wegert. In July 1999, Kingfisher attempted a takeover of Asda, one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest supermarket chains, only to be beaten by Walmart.

In August 2001, coupled with an acrimonious battle for control of Castorama, the resultant share price pressure forced the sale and demerger of several parts of the company, including Woolworths (forming the Woolworths Group), and the demerger of the electricals business to form Kesa Electricals in July 2003 – causing the company to refocus entirely around DIY.

The company was led by Gerry Murphy from December 2002 to November 2007. In January 2008, Kingfisher appointed Ian Cheshire as group chief executive. Cheshire was formerly B&amp;Q&#x27;s chief executive; his B&amp;Q role was taken over in April 2009, by Euan Sutherland, who also headed up the United Kingdom division of Kingfisher.

In September 2014, it was announced that the head of Castorama Véronique Laury would replace Ian Cheshire as Kingfisher group CEO in February 2015. Laury had worked at Kingfisher for eleven years, including roles at B&amp;Q. In June 2017, Andy Cosslett succeeded Daniel Bernard as chairman.

In March 2019, it was announced that Laury would be leaving the business at a date to be announced, following the failure of her &quot;One Kingfisher&quot; plan, and a 52.8% collapse in pre tax profits. In September 2019, Thierry Garnier was appointed as CEO.

In March 2021, following a franchise agreement with Al-Futtaim Group, Kingfisher will expand its B&amp;Q market to the Middle East. The Al-Futtaim Group will run and staff the stores in Saudi Arabia entirely.

==Operations==
Kingfisher currently operates over 1,300 stores in eight countries in Europe and in Turkey. Its main retail brands are B&amp;Q, Castorama, Brico Dépôt and Screwfix.

The companies now part of the Kingfisher group are:
* B&amp;Q; operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland
* Brico Dépôt; in France, Spain, Portugal and Romania
* Castorama; in France and Poland
* Koçtaş; 50% joint venture in Turkey
* Screwfix; in the United Kingdom and Ireland

===Former operations===
* Woolworths Group; spun off June 2001, closed in December 2008.
* Comet Group; spun off July 2003, closed in December 2012.
* Superdrug; sold to Kruidvat Beheer BV in July 2001, then A.S. Watson Group in October 2002.
* MVC; spun off with the Woolworths Group, in July 2005, ceased trading January 2006.

<text>Sir George Grey, KCB (14 April 1812 – 19 September 1898) was a British soldier, explorer, colonial administrator and writer. He served in a succession of governing positions: Governor of South Australia, twice Governor of New Zealand, Governor of Cape Colony, and the 11th premier of New Zealand. He played a key role in the colonisation of New Zealand, and both the purchase and annexation of Māori land.

Grey was born in Lisbon, Portugal, just a few days after his father, Lieutenant-Colonel George Grey, was killed at the Battle of Badajoz in Spain. He was educated in England. After military service (1829–37) and two explorations in Western Australia (1837–39), Grey became Governor of South Australia in 1841. He oversaw the colony during a difficult formative period. Despite being less hands-on than his predecessor George Gawler, his fiscally responsible measures ensured the colony was in good shape by the time he departed for New Zealand in 1845.

Grey was the most influential figure during the European settlement of New Zealand. Governor of New Zealand initially from 1845 to 1853, he was governor during the initial stages of the New Zealand Wars. Learning Māori to fluency, he became a scholar of Māori culture, compiling Māori mythology and oral history and publishing it in translation in London. He developed a cordial relationship with the powerful rangatira Pōtatau Te Wherowhero of Tainui, in order to deter Ngāpuhi from invading Auckland. He was knighted in 1848. In 1854, Grey was appointed Governor of Cape Colony in South Africa, where his resolution of hostilities between indigenous South Africans and European settlers was praised by both sides. After separating from his wife and developing a severe opium addiction, Grey was again appointed Governor of New Zealand in 1861, three years after Te Wherowhero, who had established himself the first Māori King in Grey’s absence, had died. The Kiingitanga (Maori King) posed a significant challenge to the British push for sovereignty, and with his Ngāpuhi absent from the movement, Grey found himself challenged on two sides. He struggled to reuse his skills in negotiation to maintain peace with Māori, and his relationship with Te Wherowhero&#x27;s successor Tāwhiao deeply soured. Turning on his former allies, Grey began an aggressive crackdown on Tainui and launched the Invasion of the Waikato in 1863, with 14,000 Imperial and colonial troops attacking 4,000 Māori and their families. Appointed in 1877, he served as Premier of New Zealand until 1879, where he remained a symbol of colonialism.

By political philosophy a Gladstonian liberal and Georgist, Grey eschewed the class system to be part of Auckland&#x27;s new governance he helped to establish. Cyril Hamshere argues that Grey was a &quot;great British proconsul&quot;, although he was also temperamental, demanding of associates, and lacking in some managerial abilities. For the wars of territorial expansion against Māori which he started, he remains a controversial and divisive figure in New Zealand.

==Early life ==
Grey was born in Lisbon, Portugal, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel George Grey, of the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot, who was killed at the Battle of Badajoz in Spain just a few days before. His mother, Elizabeth Anne , on the balcony of her hotel in Lisbon, overheard two officers speak of her husband&#x27;s death and this brought on the premature birth of the child. She was the daughter of a retired soldier turned Irish clergyman, Major later Reverend John Vignoles. Grey&#x27;s grandfather was Owen Wynne Gray ( 1745 – 6 January 1819). Grey&#x27;s uncle was John Gray, who was Owen Wynne Gray&#x27;s son from his second marriage.

Grey was sent to the Royal Grammar School, Guildford in Surrey, and was admitted to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1826. Early in 1830, he was gazetted ensign in the 83rd Regiment of Foot. In 1830, his regiment having been sent to Ireland, he developed much sympathy with the Irish peasantry whose misery made a great impression on him. He was promoted lieutenant in 1833 and obtained a first-class certificate at the examinations of the Royal Military College, in 1836.

==Exploration==
In 1837, at the age of 25, Grey led an ill-prepared expedition that explored North-West Australia. British settlers in Australia at the time knew little of the region and only one member of Grey&#x27;s party had been there before. It was believed possible at that time that one of the world&#x27;s largest rivers might drain into the Indian Ocean in North-West Australia; if that were found to be the case, the region it flowed through might be suitable for colonisation. Grey, with Lieutenant Franklin Lushington, of the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot, offered to explore the region. On 5 July 1837, they sailed from Plymouth in command of a party of five, the others being Lushington; Dr William Walker, a surgeon and naturalist; and Corporals John Coles and Richard Auger of the Royal Sappers and Miners. Joining the party at Cape Town were Sapper Private Robert Mustard, J.C. Cox, Thomas Ruston, Evan Edwards, Henry Williams, and Robert Inglesby. In December they landed at Hanover Bay (west of Uwins Island in the Bonaparte Archipelago). Travelling south, the party traced the course of the Glenelg River. After experiencing boat wrecks, near-drowning, becoming completely lost, and Grey himself being speared in the hip during a skirmish with Aboriginal people, the party gave up. After being picked up by HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; and the schooner &quot;Lynher&quot;, they were taken to Mauritius to recover. Lieutenant Lushington was then mobilised to rejoin his regiment in the First Anglo-Afghan War. In September 1838 Grey sailed to Perth hoping to resume his adventures.

In February 1839 Grey embarked on a second exploration expedition to the north, where he was again wrecked with his party, again including Surgeon Walker, at Kalbarri. They were the first Europeans to see the Murchison River, but then had to walk to Perth, surviving the journey through the efforts of Kaiber, a Whadjuk Noongar man (that is, indigenous to the Perth region), who organised food and what water could be found (they survived by drinking liquid mud). At about this time, Grey learnt the Noongar language.

Due to his interest in Aboriginal culture in July 1839, Grey was promoted to captain and appointed temporary Resident Magistrate at King George Sound, Western Australia, following the death of Sir Richard Spencer, the previous Resident Magistrate.

==Marriage and children==
On 2 November 1839 at King George Sound, Grey married Eliza Lucy Spencer (1822–1898), daughter of the late Government Resident, Sir Richard Spencer. Their only child, born in 1841 in South Australia, died aged five months and was buried at the West Terrace Cemetery. It was not a happy marriage. Grey, obstinate in his domestic affairs as in his first expedition, accused his wife unjustly of flirting with Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Keppel on the voyage to Cape Town taken in 1860, and sent her away. Per her obituary, she was an avid walker, reader of literature, devout churchwoman, exceptional hostess and valued friend in her life away from him. It was noted that she had keen insight into character. After their separation, Grey began the habitual abuse of opium, and struggled to regain his tenacity in maintaining peace between indigenous people and British colonisers.

Grey adopted Annie Maria Matthews (1853–1938) in 1861, following the death of her father, his half-brother, Sir Godfrey Thomas. She married Seymour Thorne George on 3 December 1872 on Kawau Island.

==Governor of South Australia==
Grey was the third Governor of South Australia, from May 1841 to October 1845. Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord John Russell, was impressed by Grey&#x27;s report on governing indigenous people. This led to Grey&#x27;s appointment as governor.

Grey replaced George Gawler, under whose stewardship the colony had become bankrupt through massive spending on public infrastructure. Gawler was also held responsible for the illegal retribution exacted by Major Thomas Shuldham O&#x27;Halloran on an Aboriginal tribe, some of whose members had murdered all 25 survivors of the &quot;Maria&quot; shipwreck. Grey was governor during another mass murder: the Rufus River Massacre, of at least 30 Aboriginals, by Europeans, on 27 August 1841.

Governor Grey sharply cut spending. The colony soon had full employment, and exports of primary products were increasing. Systematic emigration was resumed at the end of 1844. Gawler, to whom Grey ascribed every problem in the colony, undertook projects to alleviate unemployment that were of lasting value. The real salvation of the colony&#x27;s finances was the discovery of copper at Burra Burra in 1845.

===Aboriginal Witnesses Act===
In 1844, Grey enacted a series ordinances and amendments first entitled the Aborigines&#x27; Evidence Act and later known as the Aboriginal Witnesses Act. The act, which was created to &quot;facilitate the admission of the unsworn testimony of Aboriginal inhabitants of South Australia and parts adjacent&quot;, stipulated that unsworn testimony given by Australian Aboriginals would be inadmissible in court. A major consequence of the act in the following decades in Australian history was the frequent dismissal of evidence given by Indigenous Australians in massacres perpetrated against them by European settlers.

==First term as governor of New Zealand==
Grey served as Governor of New Zealand twice: from 1845 to 1853, and from 1861 to 1868.

During this time, European settlement accelerated, and in 1859 the number of Pākehā came to equal the number of Māori, at around 60,000 each. Settlers were keen to obtain land and some Māori were willing to sell, but there were also strong pressures to retain land – in particular from the Māori King Movement. Grey had to manage the demand for land for the settlers to farm and the commitments in the Treaty of Waitangi that the Māori chiefs retained full &quot;exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties.&quot; The treaty also specifies that Māori will sell land only to the Crown. The potential for conflict between the Māori and settlers was exacerbated as the British authorities progressively eased restrictions on land sales after an agreement at the end of 1840 between the company and Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell, which provided for land purchases by the New Zealand Company from the Crown at a discount price, and a charter to buy and sell land under government supervision. Money raised by the government from sales to the company would be spent on assisting migration to New Zealand. The agreement was hailed by the company as &quot;all that we could desire ... our Company is really to be the agent of the state for colonizing NZ.&quot; The Government waived its right of pre-emption in the Wellington region, Wanganui and New Plymouth in September 1841.

Following his term as Governor of South Australia, Grey was appointed the third Governor of New Zealand in 1845. During the tenure of his predecessor, Robert FitzRoy, violence over land ownership had broken out in the Wairau Valley in the South Island in June 1843, in what became known as the Wairau Affray (FitzRoy was later dismissed from office by the Colonial Office for his handling of land issues). It was only in 1846 that the war leader Te Rauparaha was arrested and imprisoned by Governor Grey without charge, which remained controversial amongst the Ngāti Toa people.

=== Hōne Heke and the Flagstaff War ===

In March 1845, Māori chief Hōne Heke began the Flagstaff War, the causes of which can be attributed to the conflict between what the Ngāpuhi understood to be the meaning of the Treaty of Waitangi (1840) and the actions of succeeding governors of asserting authority over the Māori. On 18 November 1845 George Grey arrived in New Zealand to take up his appointment as governor, where he was greeted by outgoing Governor FitzRoy, who worked amicably with Grey before departing in January 1846. At this time, Hōne Heke challenged the British authorities, beginning by cutting down the flagstaff on Flagstaff Hill at Kororareka. On this flagstaff the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand had previously flown; now the Union Jack was hoisted; hence the flagstaff symbolised the grievances of Heke and his ally Te Ruki Kawiti, as to changes that had followed the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

There were many causes of the Flagstaff War and Heke had a number of grievances in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi. While land acquisition by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) were politicised, the rebellion led by Heke was directed against the colonial forces with the CMS missionaries trying to persuade Heke to end the fighting. Despite the fact that Tāmati Wāka Nene and most of Ngāpuhi sided with the government, the small and ineptly led British had been beaten at Battle of Ohaeawai. Backed by financial support, far more troops, armed with 32-pounder cannons that had been denied to FitzRoy, Grey ordered the attack on Kawiti&#x27;s fortress at Ruapekapeka on 31 December 1845. This forced Kawiti to retreat. Ngāpuhi were astonished that the British could keep an army of nearly 1,000 soldiers in the field continuously. Heke&#x27;s confidence waned after he was wounded in battle with Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors, and by the realisation that the British had far more resources than he could muster; his enemies included some Pākehā Māori supporting colonial forces.

After the Battle of Ruapekapeka, Heke and Kawiti were ready for peace. It was Tāmati Wāka Nene they approached to act as intermediary in negotiations with Governor Grey, who accepted the advice of Nene that Heke and Kawiti should not be punished for their rebellion. The fighting in the north ended and there was no punitive confiscation of Ngāpuhi land.

=== Ngati Rangatahi and Hutt Valley campaign ===
Colonists arrived at Port Nicholson, Wellington in November 1839 in ships charted by the New Zealand Company. Within months the New Zealand Company purported to purchase approximately 20 million acres (8 million hectares) in Nelson, Wellington, Whanganui and Taranaki. Disputes arose as to the validity of purchases of land, which remained unresolved when Grey became governor.

The company saw itself as a prospective government of New Zealand and in 1845 and 1846 proposed splitting the colony in two, along a line from Mokau in the west to Cape Kidnappers in the east – with the north reserved for Māori and missionaries. The south would become a self-governing province, known as &quot;New Victoria&quot; and managed by the company for that purpose. Britain&#x27;s Colonial Secretary rejected the proposal. The company was known for its vigorous attacks on those it perceived as its opponents – the British Colonial Office, successive governors of New Zealand, and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) that was led by the Reverend Henry Williams. Williams attempted to interfere with the land purchasing practices of the company, which exacerbated the ill-will that was directed at the CMS by the Company in Wellington and the promoters of colonisation in Auckland who had access to the Governor and to the newspapers that had started publication.

Unresolved land disputes that had resulted from New Zealand Company operations erupted into fighting in the Hutt Valley in 1846. The Ngati Rangatahi were determined to retain possession of their land. They assembled a force of about 200 warriors led by Te Rangihaeata, Te Rauparaha&#x27;s nephew (son of his sister Waitohi, died 1839), also the person who had killed unarmed captives in Wairau Affray. Governor Grey moved troops into the area and by February had assembled nearly a thousand men together with some Māori allies from the Te Āti Awa hapu to begin the Hutt Valley campaign.

Māori attacked Taita on 3 March 1846, but were repulsed by a company of the 96th Regiment. The same day Grey declared martial law in the Wellington area.

Richard Taylor, a CMS missionary from Whanganui, attempted to persuade the Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Rangatahi to leave the disputed land. Eventually Grey paid compensation for the potato crop they had planted on the land. He also gave them 300 acres at Kaiwharawhara by the modern ferry terminal. Chief Taringakuri agreed to these terms. But when the settlers tried to move onto the land they were frightened off. On 27 February the British and their Te Ati Awa allies burnt the Māori Pā at Maraenuku in the Hutt Valley, which had been built on land that the settlers claimed to own. The Ngati Rangatahi retaliated on 1 and 3 March by raiding settlers&#x27; farms, destroying furniture, smashing windows, killing pigs, and threatening the settlers with death if they gave the alarm. They murdered Andrew Gillespie and his son. 13 families of settlers moved into Wellington for safety. Governor Grey proclaimed martial law on 3 March. Sporadic fighting continued, including a major attack on a defended position at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm on 6 May. On 6 August 1846, one of the last engagements was fought – the Battle of Battle Hill – after which Te Rangihaeata left the area. The Hutt Valley campaign was followed by the Wanganui campaign from April to July 1847.

In January 1846 fifteen chiefs of the area, including Te Rauparaha, had sent a combined letter to the newly arrived Governor Grey, pledging their loyalty to the British Crown. After intercepting letters from Te Rauparaha, Grey realised he was playing a double game. He was receiving and sending secret instructions to the local Māori who were attacking settlers. In a surprise attack on his pā at Taupo (now named Plimmerton) at dawn on 23 July, Te Rauparaha, who was now quite elderly, was captured and taken prisoner. The justification given for his arrest was weapons supplied to Māori deemed to be in open rebellion against the Crown. However, charges were never laid against Te Rauparaha so his detention was declared unlawful. While Grey&#x27;s declaration of Martial law was within his authority, internment without trial would only be lawful if it had been authorised by statute. Te Rauparaha was held prisoner on &quot;HMS Driver&quot;, then he was taken to Auckland on HMS &quot;Calliope&quot; where he remained imprisoned until January 1848.

His son Tāmihana was studying Christianity in Auckland and Te Rauparaha gave him a solemn message that their iwi should not take utu against the government. Tāmihana returned to his rohe to stop a planned uprising. Tāmihana sold the Wairau land to the government for 3,000 pounds. Grey spoke to Te Rauaparaha and persuaded him to give up all outstanding claims to land in the Wairau valley. Then, realising he was old and sick he allowed Te Rauparaha to return to his people at Ōtaki in 1848.

===Government at Auckland===

Auckland was made the new capital in March 1841 and by the time Grey was appointed governor in 1845, it had become a commercial centre as well as including the administrative institutions such as the Supreme Court. After the conclusion of the war in the north, government policy was to place a buffer zone of European settlement between the Ngāpuhi and the city of Auckland. The background to the Invasion of Waikato in 1863 also, in part, reflected a belief that the Auckland was at risk from attack by the Waikato Māori.

Governor Grey had to contend with newspapers that were unequivocal to their support of the interests of the settlers: the &quot;Auckland Times&quot;, &quot;Auckland Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Southern Cross&quot;, which started by William Brown as a weekly paper in 1843 and &quot;The New Zealander&quot;, which was started in 1845 by John Williamson. These newspapers were known for their partisan editorial policies – both William Brown and John Williamson were aspiring politicians. &quot;The Southern Cross&quot; supported the land claimants, such as the New Zealand Company, and vigorously attacked Governor Grey&#x27;s administration, while &quot;The New Zealander&quot;, supported the ordinary settler and the Māori. The northern war adversely affected business in Auckland, such that &quot;The Southern Cross&quot; stopped publishing from April 1845 to July 1847. Hugh Carleton, who also became a politician, was the editor of &quot;The New Zealander&quot; then later established the &quot;Anglo-Maori Warder&quot;, which followed an editorial policy in opposition to Governor Grey.

At the time of the northern war &quot;The Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;The New Zealander&quot; blamed Henry Williams and the other CMS missionaries for the Flagstaff War. The &quot;New Zealander&quot; newspaper in a thinly disguised reference to Henry Williams, with the reference to &quot;their Rangatira pakeha [gentlemen] correspondents&quot;, went on to state: We consider these English traitors far more guilty and deserving of severe punishment than the brave natives whom they have advised and misled. Cowards and knaves in the full sense of the terms, they have pursued their traitorous schemes, afraid to risk their own persons, yet artfully sacrificing others for their own aggrandizement, while, probably at the same time, they were most hypocritically professing most zealous loyalty.

Official communications also blamed the CMS missionaries for the Flagstaff War. In a letter of 25 June 1846 to William Ewart Gladstone, the Colonial Secretary in Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s government, Governor Grey referred to the land acquired by the CMS missionaries and commented that &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Government may also rest satisfied that these individuals cannot be put in possession of these tracts of land without a large expenditure of British blood and money&quot;. By the end of his first term as governor, Grey had changed his opinion as to the role of the CMS missionaries, which was limited to attempts to persuade Hōne Heke bring an end to the fighting with the British soldiers and the Ngāpuhi, led by Tāmati Wāka Nene, who remained loyal to the Crown.

Grey was &quot;shrewd and manipulative&quot; and his main objective was to impose British sovereignty over New Zealand, which he did by force when he felt it necessary. But his first strategy to attain land was to attack the close relationship between missionaries and Māori, including Henry Williams who had relationships with chiefs.

In 1847 William Williams published a pamphlet that defended the role of the CMS in the years leading up to the war in the north. The first Anglican bishop of New Zealand, George Selwyn, took the side of Grey in relation to the purchase of the land. Grey twice failed to recover the land in the Supreme Court, and when Williams refused to give up the land unless the charges were retracted, he was dismissed from the CMS in November 1849. Governor Grey&#x27;s first term of office ended in 1853. In 1854 Williams was reinstated to CMS after Bishop Selwyn later regretted the position and George Grey addressed the committee of the CMS and requested his reinstatement.

When he returned to New Zealand in 1861 for his second term as governor, Sir George and Henry Williams meet at the Waimate Mission Station in November 1861. Also in 1861 Henry Williams&#x27; son Edward Marsh Williams was appointed by Sir George to be the Resident Magistrate for the Bay of Islands and Northern Districts.

=== Self-government and Constitution Acts ===
Following a campaign for self-government by settlers in 1846, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846, granting the colony self-government for the first time, requiring Māori to pass an English-language test to be able to participate in the new colonial government. In his instructions to Grey, Colonial Secretary Earl Grey (no relation to George Grey) sent the 1846 Constitution Act with instructions to implement self-government. George Grey responded to Earl Grey that the Act would lead to further hostilities and that the settlers were not ready for self-government. In a dispatch to Earl Grey, Governor Grey stated that in implementing the Act, Her Majesty would not be giving the self-government that was intended, instead:
&quot;...she will give to a small fraction of her subjects of one race the power of governing the large majority of her subjects of a different race... there is no reason to think that they would be satisfied with, and submit to, the rule of a minority&quot;

Earl Grey agreed and in December 1847 introduced an Act suspending most of the 1846 Constitution Act. Grey wrote a draft of a new Constitution Act while camping on Mount Ruapehu in 1851, forwarding this draft to the Colonial Office later that year. Grey&#x27;s draft established both provincial and central representative assemblies, allowed for Māori districts and a Governor elected by the General Assembly. Only the latter proposal was rejected by the Parliament of the United Kingdom when it adopted Grey&#x27;s constitution, the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852.

Grey was briefly appointed Governor-in-Chief on 1 January 1848, while he oversaw the establishment of the first provinces of New Zealand, New Ulster and New Munster.

====Treaty obligations====

In 1846, Lord Stanley, the British Colonial Secretary, who was a devout Anglican, three times British Prime Minister and oversaw the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, was asked by Governor Grey how far he was expected to abide by the Treaty of Waitangi. The direct response in the Queen&#x27;s name was:

Following the election of the first parliament in 1853, responsible government was instituted in 1856. The direction of &quot;native affairs&quot; was kept at the sole discretion of the governor, meaning control of Māori affairs and land remained outside of the elected ministry. This quickly became a point of contention between the Governor and the colonial parliament, who retained their own &quot;Native Secretary&quot; to advise them on &quot;native affairs&quot;. In 1861, Governor Grey agreed to consult the ministers in relation to native affairs, but this position only lasted until his recall from office in 1867. Grey&#x27;s successor as governor, George Bowen, took direct control of native affairs until his term ended in 1870. From then on, the elected ministry, led by the Premier, controlled the colonial government&#x27;s policy on Māori land.

The short-term effect of the treaty was to prevent the sale of Māori land to anyone other than the Crown. This was intended to protect Māori from the kinds of shady land purchases which had alienated indigenous peoples in other parts of the world from their land with minimal compensation. Before the treaty had been finalised the New Zealand Company had made several hasty land deals and shipped settlers from Great Britain to New Zealand, hoping the British would be forced to accept its land claims as a fait accompli, in which it was largely successful.

In part, the treaty was an attempt to establish a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse. Initially, this worked well with the Governor and his representatives having the sole right to buy and sell land from the Māori. Māori were eager to sell land, and settlers eager to buy.

===Legacy of Grey&#x27;s first term as Governor===
Grey took pains to tell Māori that he had observed the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi, assuring them that their land rights would be fully recognised. In the Taranaki district, Māori were very reluctant to sell their land, but elsewhere Grey was much more successful, and nearly 33 million acres (130,000 km2) were purchased from Māori, with the result that British settlements expanded quickly. Grey was less successful in his efforts to assimilate Māori; he lacked the financial means to realise his plans. Although he subsidised mission schools, requiring them to teach in English, only a few hundred Māori children attended them at any one time.

During Grey&#x27;s first tenure as Governor of New Zealand, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (1848). When Grey was knighted he chose Tāmati Wāka Nene as one of his esquires.

Grey gave land for the establishment of Auckland Grammar School in Newmarket, Auckland in 1850. The school was officially recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 through the Auckland Grammar School Appropriation Act of the Provincial Government. Chris Laidlaw concludes that Grey ran a &quot;ramshackle&quot; administration marked by &quot;broken promises and outright betrayal&quot; of Māori people. Grey&#x27;s collection of Māori artefacts, one of the earliest from New Zealand and assembled during his first governorship, was donated to the British Museum in 1854.

Much of Grey&#x27;s manuscript collections were donated to the Auckland Free Public Library in 1887, one of the first substantial donations to the library. Grey&#x27;s Māori manuscript collections held at Auckland Libraries were added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2011.

==Governor of Cape Colony==

Grey was Governor of Cape Colony from 5 December 1854 to 15 August 1861. He founded Grey College, Bloemfontein in 1855 and Grey High School in Port Elizabeth in 1856. In 1859 he laid the foundation stone of the New Somerset Hospital, Cape Town. When he left the Cape in 1861 he presented the National Library of South Africa with a remarkable personal collection of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and rare books.

During his term as governor, Grey faced a growing rivalry between the eastern and western halves of the Cape Colony, as well as a small, but also growing, movement for local democracy (&quot;responsible government&quot;) and greater independence from British rule. 
&quot;There were moves for responsible government in the Cape Parliament in 1855 and 1856 but they were defeated by a combination of Western conservatives and Easterners anxious about the defence of the frontier under a responsible system. But undoubtedly Sir George Grey&#x27;s political ability, charm and force of personality – aided by the parliamentary leadership of liberal-minded Attorney-General, William Porter – contributed to this result.&quot; 
In South Africa Grey dealt firmly with the natives, endeavouring to &quot;protect&quot; them from white settlement while simultaneously using reservations to coercively demilitarize them, using natives, in his own words, &quot;as real though unavowed hostages for the tranquillity of their kindred and connections.&quot; On more than one occasion, Grey acted as arbitrator between the government of the Orange Free State and the natives, eventually drawing the conclusion that a federated South Africa would be a good thing for everyone. The Orange Free State would have been willing to join the federation, and it is probable that the Transvaal would also have agreed. However, Grey was 50 years before his time: the Colonial Office would not agree to his proposals. In spite of their instructions, Grey continued to advocate union, and, in connection with other matters, such as the attempt to settle soldiers in South Africa after the Crimean War, instructions were ignored.

Sir George was recalled in 1859. He had, however, scarcely reached England before a change of government led to the offer of another term, on the understanding that he abandon schemes for the federation of South Africa and, in future obey his instructions. Grey was convinced that the boundaries of the South African colonies should be widened, but could not obtain support from the British government. He was still working for this support when, war with the Māori having broken out, it was decided that Grey should again be appointed governor of New Zealand. When he left his popularity among the people of Cape Colony was unbounded, and the statue erected at Cape Town during his lifetime described him asa governor who by his high character as a Christian, a statesman, and a gentleman, had endeared himself to all classes of the community, and who by his zealous devotion to the best interests of South Africa and his able and just administration, has secured the approbation and gratitude of all Her Majesty&#x27;s subjects in this part of her dominions.
==Second term as governor of New Zealand==

Grey was again appointed governor in 1861, to replace Governor Thomas Gore Browne, serving until 1868. His second term as governor was greatly different from the first, as he had to deal with the demands of an elected parliament, which had been established in 1852.

===Invasion of the Waikato===

Immediately prior to Grey&#x27;s re-appointment as governor, there were rising tensions in Taranaki over land ownership and sovereignty that eventually led to the involvement of British military forces at Waitara, in what is called the First Taranaki War, from March 1860 until the fighting subsided in 1862.

The leaders of the King movement or Kīngitanga had written a letter to Governor Browne stating that the Waikato tribes had never signed the Treaty of Waitangi and that they were a separate nation. Browne regarded the stance of the Kīngitanga as an act of disloyalty; and prepared plans for the invasion of Waikato, in part to uphold &quot;the Queen&#x27;s supremacy&quot; in the face of the Kīngitanga challenge.

Grey launched the invasion of the Waikato in June 1863 amid mounting tension between Kingites and the colonial government and fears of a violent raid on Auckland by Kingite Māori. Grey used as the trigger for the invasion Kingite rejection of his ultimatum on 9 July 1863 that all Māori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River.

The war brought thousands of Imperial British troops to New Zealand: 18,000 men served in the British forces at some point during the campaign, with a peak of about 14,000 troops in March 1864.

The subsequent invasion included the Battle of Rangiriri (November 1863)—which cost both sides more men than any other engagement of the New Zealand Wars—and the attack on Rangiaowhia (February 1864) a village largely occupied by women, children and older men.

The campaign ended with the retreat of the Kingitanga Māori into the rugged interior of the North Island and the colonial government confiscating about 12,000 km2 of Māori land. The defeat and confiscations left the King Movement tribes with a legacy of poverty and bitterness that was partly assuaged in 1995 when the government conceded that the 1863 invasion and confiscation was wrongful and apologised for its actions.

In the later 1860s, the British government determined to withdraw Imperial troops from New Zealand. At the time the Māori chiefs Te Kooti and Tītokowaru had the colonial government and settlers extremely alarmed with a series of military successes. With the support of the Premier Edward Stafford, Grey evaded instructions from the Colonial Office to finalise the return of the regiments, which had commenced in 1865 and 1866. In the end, the British government recalled (removed) Grey from the office of governor in February 1868. He was replaced by Sir George Bowen and during his term hostilities concluded with the abandoned pursuit of war leader Riwha Tītokowaru – again in Taranaki – in 1869.

=== Legacy ===
Grey was greatly respected by some Māori and often travelled with a company of chiefs. He induced leading chiefs to write down their accounts of Māori traditions, legends and customs. His principal informant, Te Rangikāheke, taught Grey to speak Māori. Historian Michael King noted: He learned Māori and persuaded Māori authorities to commit their legends and traditions to writing, some of which were subsequently published ... His collected papers would turn out to be the largest single repository of Māori-language manuscripts.

Grey bought Kawau Island in 1862, on his return to New Zealand for a second term as governor. For 25 years, he lavished large amounts of his personal wealth on developing the island. He enlarged and remodeled Mansion House, the former residence of the copper mine superintendent. Here he planted a huge array of native and non-native trees and shrubs, and acclimatised many exotic birds and other animal species. The invasive species he introduced included pine trees and Australian marsupials (possum and wallabies), which went on to become significant weeds and pests. He also amassed a celebrated collection of rare books and manuscripts, many purchased from the Auckland bibliophile Henry Shaw, artworks and curiosities, plus artefacts from Māori.

== Return to England ==
On his return journey to England from New Zealand, Grey worked on preparing previously compiled Māori myths for publication; this work led to &quot;Ko Nga Mahinga a Nga Tupuna Maori&quot; and the English translation &quot;Polynesian Mythology and Ancient Traditional History of the New Zealand Race as Furnished by Their Priests and Chiefs&quot;. &quot;Polynesian Mythology&quot; was well received by the European public, with Grey receiving many letters of praise. In particular, the story of Hinemoa was popular enough to inspire Alfred Domett&#x27;s novel &quot;Ranolf and Amohia&quot;, Nicholas Chevalier&#x27;s painting &quot;Hinemoa&quot;, and New Zealand&#x27;s first feature film in 1914.

Although by philosophy Grey was a liberal, his extremist views on the questions of the British Empire, of emigration, of Home Rule for Ireland and the cause of the English poor were contrary to the interests of Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal government. Grey was marked as a &quot;dangerous man&quot;. In 1870, at a parliamentary by-election for the Borough of Newark that followed the death of the sitting Liberal MP, Grey stood as an independent liberal against Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal candidate Sir Henry Knight Storks. Determined that Grey should not be elected and seeing that splitting the Liberal vote would result in both Grey and Storks losing to the Conservative candidate, the Liberal government engineered an arrangement where both would withdraw, leaving another Liberal candidate, Samuel Boteler Bristowe, to take the seat. Storks was rewarded with the post of Surveyor-General of the Ordnance and Grey returned to New Zealand later that year.

== Premier of New Zealand==



In 1875 Sir George was elected Superintendent of Auckland Province (24 March 1875 – 31 October 1875). He stood in the general election for both the Auckland West and the Thames electorates in the 1875–1876 general election. In the two-member Auckland electorate, only Grey and Patrick Dignan were put forward as candidates, and were thus declared elected on 22 December 1875. The two-member Thames electorate was contested by six candidates, including Julius Vogel (who was Premier in 1875), William Rowe and Charles Featherstone Mitchell. On election day (6 January 1876), Grey attracted the highest number of votes and, unexpectedly, Rowe beat Vogel into second place (Vogel also stood in Wanganui, where he was returned). Hence Grey and Rowe were declared elected for Thames. A protest against Grey&#x27;s election was lodged with the returning officer the following day, protesting that Grey had not been eligible to stand in Thames as he had already been elected in Auckland West. This petition was filed to the House of Representatives at the end of January.

With this controversy going on for several months unresolved, Grey advised in mid-June 1876 in a series of telegrams that he had chosen to represent Auckland West. On 8 July, the report of the committee inquiring into his election for Thames was read to the House. It was found that this was in accordance with the law, but that he had to make a decision for which electorate he would sit. On 15 July 1876, Grey announced that he would represent Thames, and he moved that a by-election be held in Auckland West for the seat that he would vacate there.
Grey opposed the abolition of the provinces, but his opposition proved ineffective; the provincial system was abolished in 1876. On defeating Harry Atkinson on 13 October 1877 in a vote of no confidence, he was elected Premier by Parliament. He asked Governor Lord Normanby for a dissolution of parliament but was flatly refused. Grey thought New Zealand&#x27;s unique constitutional provincialism was under threat, so championed radical causes, such as one man-one vote. An economic downturn in 1878 put pressure on incomes; defection across the floor of the house of four Auckland members defeated Grey on a vote in October 1879. He resigned as prime minister. Grey described his philosophical radicalism: This is a revolt against despotism…. What I am resolved to maintain is this, that there shall be equal justice in representation and in the distribution of land and revenue to every class in New Zealand … equal rights to all – equal rights in education, equal rights in taxation, equal rights in representation … equal rights in every respect.
His government did not operate particularly well, with Grey seeking to dominate the government came into conflict with the governor. His term as premier is regarded by historians as a failure. Towards the end of 1879, Grey&#x27;s government got into difficulties over land tax. Eventually, Grey asked for an early election, in 1879.

Grey was elected in both the Thames and the City of Christchurch electorates in September 1879. Grey came first in the three-member Christchurch electorate (Samuel Paull Andrews and Edward Stevens came second with equal numbers of votes, 23 votes ahead of Edward Richardson). Richardson petitioned against Grey&#x27;s return on technical grounds, as Grey had already been elected in the Thames electorate. The electoral commission unseated Grey on 24 October, effective 28 October, with Richardson declared elected to the vacancy on that date. Grey kept the Thames seat and remained a member of parliament through that electorate.

In the 1881 election, Grey was elected in Auckland East and re-elected in the 1884 election. In the 1887 election Grey was returned for the electorate.
In 1889, recalling his earlier proposal for the Governor to be elected from his first draft of the 1852 Constitution Act, Grey put forward the Election of Governor Bill, which would have allowed for a &quot;British subject&quot; to be elected to the office of Governor &quot;precisely as an ordinary parliamentary election in each district.&quot;

By now Grey was suffering from ill health and he retired from politics in 1890, leaving for Australia to recuperate. While in Australia, he took part in the Australian Federal Convention. On returning to New Zealand, a deputation requested him to contest the Newton seat in Auckland in the 1891 by-election. The retiring member, David Goldie, also asked Grey to take his seat. Grey was prepared to put his name forward only if the election was unopposed, as he did not want to suffer the excitement of a contested election. Grey declared his candidacy on 25 March 1891. On 6 April 1891, he was declared elected, as he was unopposed. In December 1893, Grey was again elected, this time to Auckland City. He left for England in 1894 and did not return to New Zealand. He resigned his seat in 1895.

==Death==
Grey died at his residence at the Norfolk Hotel, Harrington Road, South Kensington, London, on 19 September 1898, aged 86 years, and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Places and institutions named after Grey==

Places named after Grey include Greytown in the Wairarapa region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, the Grey River in the South Island&#x27;s West Coast region (and thus indirectly the town of Greymouth at the river&#x27;s mouth), and the Auckland suburb of Grey Lynn; the Division of Grey, an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia and the town of Grey in Western Australia. Grey Street, Melbourne, Grey Street, Wellington and Grey Street, Onehunga are also believed to have been named after George Edward Grey. Grey&#x27;s Bay in Geraldton, Western Australia, is also named after him.

In South Africa, Grey was instrumental in the founding of the Grey Institute, later named the Grey High School, Port Elizabeth, Grey College, Bloemfontein and Grey&#x27;s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. Grey&#x27;s Pass near Citrusdal and the towns of Greytown, KwaZulu-Natal and Greyton, Western Cape are named for him, while Lady Grey, Eastern Cape is named after his wife. The main business thoroughfare in the town of Paarl (Western Cape) is named Lady Grey Street after his wife, while Cape Town has Sir George Grey Street in the inner city suburb of Oranjezicht draped over the foothills of Table Mountain.

Grey&#x27;s Spring, sometimes called Grey&#x27;s Well, is a historic site in Kalbarri, Western Australia.

The Rhodesian Grey’s Scouts was also named after George Grey.

==Taxa named after Grey==
&quot;Menetia greyii&quot;, a species of lizard, is named after Grey. Other animal taxa named in his honour include two mammals and a bird.

The genus &quot;Greyia&quot; (wild bottlebrush) which is endemic to southern Africa was also named after him.

==Popular culture and depiction in art==
A Statue of George Grey created by William Calder Marshall was unveiled at the Company&#x27;s Garden in Cape Town, South Africa in 1863. Sculptor Anton Teutenberg created a relief sculpture of Grey as a part of his commission for the Auckland High Court in 1866. In 1904, a statue of George Grey was erected on the corner of Greys Avenue and Queen Street, later moved to Albert Park in 1922. Grey&#x27;s statue has been the target of vandalism and activism, including in 1987, when the head of the statue was broken off on Waitangi Day.

&quot; The Governor&quot;, an historical drama miniseries based on Grey&#x27;s life, was made by TVNZ and the National Film Unit in 1977, featuring Corin Redgrave in the title role. Despite critical acclaim, the miniseries attracted controversy at the time because of its then-large budget.

<text>Height above average terrain (HAAT), or (less popularly) effective height above average terrain (EHAAT), is the vertical position of an antenna site above the surrounding landscape. HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this).

The FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station. The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, is the HAAT. This can create some unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions—it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT (the transmitter would not be located underground, but rather in a valley, with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself, for example).

The FCC has divided the Contiguous United States into three zones for the determination of spacing between FM and TV stations using the same frequencies. FM and TV stations are assigned maximum ERP and HAAT values, depending on their assigned zones, to prevent co-channel interference.
The FCC regulations for ERP and HAAT are listed under Title 47, Part 73 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

==FM==
===Zones I and I-A===
*Maximum HAAT: 
*Maximum ERP: 50 kilowatts (47dBW)
*Minimum co-channel separation: 

===Zones II and III===
*Maximum HAAT: 
*Maximum ERP: 100 kilowatts (50dBW)
*Minimum co-channel separation: .

==TV==
In all zones, maximum ERP for analog TV transmitters is as follows:

*VHF 2-6: 100 kilowatts (50dBW) (analog); 45 kilowatts (46.5dBW) (digital)
*VHF 7-13: 316 kilowatts (55dBW) (analog); 160 kilowatts (52dBW) (digital)
*UHF: 5,000 kilowatts (67dBW) (analog); 1,000 kilowatts (60dBW) (digital)

===Maximum HAAT===
*Zone I: 
*Zones II and III: 

===Minimum co-channel separation===
==Zone layouts==
Zone I (the most densely populated zone) consists of the entire land masses of the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia; in addition to the northern and eastern portions of Virginia; the areas of Michigan and southeastern Wisconsin south of 43° 30&#x27; north latitude; the coastal strip of Maine; the areas of New Hampshire and Vermont south of 45° north latitude; and the areas of western New York south of 43° 30&#x27; north latitude and eastern New York south of 45° north latitude. In addition, Zone I-A (FM only) consists of all of California south of 40° north latitude, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (If the dividing line between Zones I and II runs through a city, that city is considered to be in Zone I.).

Zones I and I-A have the most &quot;grandfathered&quot; overpowered stations, which are allowed the same extended coverage areas that they had before the zones were established. One of the most powerful of these stations is WBCT in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which operates at 320,000 watts and 238 meters (781 ft) HAAT.

Zone III (the zone with the flattest terrain) consists of all of Florida and the areas of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas within approximately of the Gulf of Mexico.

Zone II is all the rest of the Continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.

<text>The Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are Centrally Funded Business Schools for management offering undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral and executive programmes along with some additional courses in the field of business administration. The establishment of IIMs was initiated by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, based on the recommendation of the Planning Commission of India.

IIMs were declared institutions of national importance by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) after the passage of Indian Institutes of Management Act, 2017. By this act, IIMs were given more autonomy in handling their day-to-day operations. The act changed the IIM governing body from the IIM council to an IIM coordination forum. IIMs were granted much leeway to decide their courses, fees and other related matters. Top IIMs — such as IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta, IIM Indore and IIM Lucknow — have featured in top 100 global b-schools by FT MBA Ranking, as well as achieved top 10 rankings among management schools in India, according to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) used by the HRD minister of India.

The full time Master of Business Administration (MBA) programmes, are the flagship programs across all IIMs. The full time MBA degree is offered as a two-year Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP) or the one-year global MBA (EPGP, PGPX, MBAEx, PGPEX-VLM, PGP-BL &amp; IPMX). Seven leading IIMs IIM Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Indore, Shillong, Lucknow and Kozhikode offer the one year MBA as a full-time programme that follows the global MBA norms. Some IIMs also offer a two-year part time (executive) MBA for graduates with more work experience.

IIMs only offered diplomas at the end of the full time programmes However, since the passage of IIM Act 2017, all IIMs have started offering Master of Business Administration (MBA). Some IIMs offer the Fellow Programme in Management (FPM), a doctoral programme. The fellowship is considered to be equivalent to a DBA globally. Most IIMs also offer short-term Executive MBA courses and part-time programmes. Some IIMs also offer unique programs, like IIM Bodh Gaya, IIM Rohtak, IIM Ranchi and IIM Indore&#x27;s Five Year Integrated Programme in Management and IIM Lucknow&#x27;s Working Managers&#x27; Programme of two years. IIM Rohtak is the only IIM which offers a Five Year Integrated Program in Law (BBA+LLB).

== History ==
After India became independent in 1947, the Planning Commission was entrusted to oversee and direct the development of the nation. India grew rapidly in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of public sector enterprises that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of UCLA to help in setting up an All India Institute of Management Studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named &quot;Indian Institutes of Management&quot;. Calcutta and Ahmedabad were chosen as the locations for the two new institutes.

The institute at Calcutta was established first, on 13 November 1961, and was named &quot;Indian Institute of Management Calcutta&quot; or &quot;IIM Calcutta&quot;. It was set up in collaboration with the MIT Sloan School of Management, the government of West Bengal, the Ford Foundation, and Indian industry. The institute at Ahmedabad was established in the following month and was named the &quot;Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad&quot;. Like MIT Sloan in the case of IIM Calcutta, Harvard Business School played an important role in the initial stages of IIM Ahmedabad.

In 1972, a committee headed by Ravi J. Matthai took note of the success of the two established IIMs and recommended the setting up of two more IIMs. Based on the committee&#x27;s recommendation, a new IIM, originally intended to cater exclusively to the needs of public sector enterprises, was established in Bangalore (IIM Bangalore) the next year. In 1981, the first IIM Review Committee was convened to examine the progress of the three existing IIMs and to make recommendations. The committee noted that the three IIMs were producing around 400 PGP graduates every year and that they had reached their optimum capacity. It proposed the opening of two more IIMs to meet the rising demand for management professionals. It also recommended expanding the Fellowship programmes, similar to PhD programmes, to meet the growing demand for faculty in management schools in India. The fourth IIM, IIM Lucknow, was established in 1984 based on the committee&#x27;s recommendation.

Two more IIMs, the fifth and sixth, were established at Kozhikode and Indore in 1996. IIM Shillong was the seventh IIM to be established, following a 2005 decision by the Government of India; its foundation stone was laid on 1 December 2007; and its first academic session was 2008–09. Since 2007, fourteen new IIMs have been set up, bringing the total number of IIMs to 20, IIM-Jammu being the latest one, starting in 2016. In 2023, prestigious National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Mumbai, was converted into an IIM, making for a total of 21 IIMs.

The Union Cabinet, on 24 January 2017, approved the bill that became the Indian Institutes of Management Act, 2017, which declares IIMs as Institutes of National Importance and enables them to grant degrees and to further make other important changes to the institute. The IIM bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 28 July 2017 and by the Rajya Sabha on 19 December 2017. After receiving presidential assent, the IIM bill became an Act on 31 December 2017.

In the 2023 Union Budget grants to the IIMs were cut in half. Heads of IIMs and B-schools said this would effect the newer IIMs disproportionately.

== Academics ==
The IIMs mainly offer undergraduate/ postgraduate, postgraduate, doctoral, and executive education programs. Some programs offered by all IIMs are similar; however, some IIMs offer unique programs for specialized purposes.

===Postgraduate Management Program===

==== Two-year MBA (Post Graduate Program) ====
All IIMs offer a two-year full-time Post Graduate Program in Management (PGP), equivalent to a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. The program is considered the flagship program of IIMs, and awards the Master of Business Administration (MBA) to successful candidates. Since 2018, all the IIMs have started granting MBA degrees for this flagship program.

This program is usually structured into six trimesters spread across two years, starting in June and running until April of the second year. The first-year coursework generally consists of core courses in various management disciplines, while in the second year, students are allowed to select courses from an exhaustive list of electives. The PGP is a general, fully integrated management program with no specialization, and typically includes courses in:
** accounting,
** behavioral science,
** finance,
** economics,
** human resource management (HRM),
** management sciences and information technology,
** marketing,
** business operations,
** business mathematics,
** public policy,
** statistics and decision analysis,
** strategy, and
** general management.
The 2-year MBA programs offered by IIMs at:
** Bangalore,
** Ahmedabad,
** Calcutta,
** Udaipur,
** Lucknow and
** Indore
are often termed as Master&#x27;s in Management (MIM) internationally and are often placed around top 100 Master&#x27;s in Management programs across the world since inception.

==== One-year full time MBA ====
To compete on the global stage, the premier IIMs found the necessity to start MBA programs that would be ranked globally at par with the MBA programs of Harvard (Harvard Business School of Harvard University) and Wharton (The Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania). Within a decade of their inception, the one-year MBA programs have catapulted the position of the top IIMs to within the top 50 global MBA list. Since 2006, IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta, IIM Lucknow, IIM Indore, IIM Kozhikode, IIM Shillong and IIM Udaipur have started offering the one-year, full-time postgraduate programs for professionals having approximately 5 years or more of work experience, which are a unique addition to the bucket of flagship programs which adds experienced professionals who add valued experience to the system of full-time MBA.

The one-year program was necessitated because the normal 2-year program is primarily aimed at new graduates or graduates with less than 4–5 years of work experience. The 1-year programs are general, fully integrated management programs with no specialization, and typically include the same courses as offered in a typical 2-year MBA program. These intensive programs typically require 75 credits or around 750 hours of classroom teaching along with projects and other coursework as in a normal 2-year MBA program. The flagship 1-year MBA programs offered by IIMs at Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Calcutta are often termed as Global MBAs internationally and have been ranked within the top 50 Global MBA programs across the world since their inception.

Designed as a regular MBA program, which focuses on using the prior work experience of the students, the one-year Executive MBA is named differently by different IIMs. It is called Post Graduate Program for Executives at IIM Calcutta and IIM Shillong (PGPEX for short), and at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Udaipur (PGPX for short). It is called an Executive Post Graduate Program (EPGP) at IIM Bangalore and IIM Indore, and International Program in Management for Executives (IPMX) at IIM Lucknow. All these programs admit only candidates with 5 or more years of professional experience and usually use a combination of GMAT score, essays, and personal interviews as entry criteria, similar to other globally reputed MBA programs. The median GMAT score of the batches at IIM Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Indore and IIM Udaipur is usually above 700 and compares with the best in the world.

==== Other specialty full time MBA programmes ====
Other than these general variants, many IIMs offer specialty programmes built which focus on different areas, e.g. Post Graduate Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) at IIM Lucknow, Post Graduate Programme in Human Resource Management (PGPHRM) at IIM Ranchi and many more.

=== Five-year Integrated Management Programme (Undergraduate/Postgraduate Education) ===

Five IIMs, IIM Indore and IIM Rohtak, IIM Jammu, IIM Bodh Gaya and IIM Ranchi also offer five-year integrated programs. Students join this program after high school (class XII). The program is called IPM (Integrated Programme in Management) at both the institutes. The course structures are similar though not same at both the institutes. For three years, students focus on &quot;statistics, economics and humanities&quot;, joining the post-graduate cohort in years 4 and 5. IIM Indore established its program in 2011 and IIM Rohtak in 2019. They were followed by IIM Ranchi, IIM Jammu and IIM Bodhgaya in 2021. IIM Indore awards program graduates both BA (Foundations of Management) and MBA. IIM Rohtak awards the BBA/MBA to five-year graduates and BBA to students who opt-out after three years.

=== Fellow Programme in Management (DBA) ===
IIMs offer a Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) as a full-time DBA Programme . This programme is aimed at preparing students for careers in teaching or research in different disciplines of management, as well as for careers outside academics that demand a high degree of investigative and analytical ability. A student who completes this programme at any IIM, where (s)he is registered as a doctoral scholar, is awarded the title of &quot;Fellow Member&quot; (e.g. &quot;Fellow Member of the Indian Institutes of Management&quot;). This Fellow Programme is equivalent to the DBA degree. Students receiving such a fellowship every year, across all IIMs, work in close association with one another in specific research areas of their choice.

=== Executive Management Programme ===
Many IIMs offer Executive MBA programme targeted at working professionals. These are often short-term or part-time programmes and are known by various names such as &quot;Management Development Programme&quot; (MDP), &quot;Advanced Masters Program in Management of Global Enterprises&quot; (AMPM), and &quot;Executive General Management Programme&quot; (EGMP). The certificate programmes at IIMs are not considered equivalent to an Executive MBA offered by the IIMs . Only the diploma-level programmes are considered equivalent, depending on whether it is full-time or part-time. Many IIMs—such as IIMC, IIMB, IIMK, IIM Kashipur, and IIM Rohtak—have partnered with third-party companies to enable these courses to be provided under a distributed model.

=== Other programmes ===
Some IIMs offer specialised programmes targeted at various management segments. IIM Ahmedabad offers a six-month, full-time programme called the &quot;Armed Forces Programme&quot; (AFP) aimed at military personnel. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore offer full-time programmes in public administration and public policy are called the &quot;Post Graduate Programme in Public Management and Policy&quot; (PGP-PMP) and &quot;Post Graduate Programme in Public Policy Management&quot; (PGPPM), respectively for civil servants of the Indian Administrative Service cadre. IIM Bangalore offers a two-year, part-time programme called the &quot;Post-Graduate Programme in Software Enterprise Management&quot; (PGPSEM), an executive general-management education programme designed for the specific needs of professionals working in the software and information technology industry. IIM Indore offers a 5-year &quot;Integrated Programme in Management&quot; (IPM) that leads to a combined undergraduate-cum-graduate diploma. IIM Ranchi is the first and only IIM to offer a full-time &quot;Post Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management&quot; (PGDHRM) programme. IIM Bangalore offers a two-year Mahatma Gandhi National Fellowship to &quot;promote skill development in district economies&quot;.

== Admission process ==
Different programmes of IIMs follow different admission processes. Admission for residents of India to the two-year PGP programmes at all IIMs is based on the Common Admission Test (CAT). CAT scores are often used as the primary short-listing criteria for admissions. International/overseas applicants have the option to apply using GMAT scores in lieu of CAT scores. GMAT scores are a prerequisite short-listing criteria used for admission to the one-year full-time programme for experienced executives. Test requirements for doctoral programmes vary. Some IIMs require candidates to make a presentation of a broad research idea or take a Research Aptitude Test (RAT) followed by a round of interviews while all are compelled to accept scores on standardised tests such as the CAT, GATE, GMAT, and GRE. The overall profiles of candidates, including past academic and professional accomplishments, are considered for all programmes, along with valid standard test scores. Some programmes require essays and academic or professional recommendations. The final round of admission evaluations involves an interview, before which some IIMs conduct other evaluation processes like written assessment tests and group discussions.

=== Entrance exam ===

The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a management aptitude test conducted by the IIMs primarily as an evaluation tool for admission to their two-year PGP programmes. It is widely considered one of the most competitive exams in the world, with a success rate of around one in two hundred. Even with the recent addition of new colleges, in 2013 the acceptance rate at IIMs was 1.714%, one of the lowest in the world.

Originally conducted as a paper-and-pencil test given on a particular date all over India, in 2009 CAT began being given as a computer-based assessment operated by Prometric. In 2014, TCS received a 5-year contract to conduct the test. The online test is now given over a period of a few weeks.

In August 2011, the six newer IIMs (Raipur, Rohtak, Ranchi, Udaipur, Trichy and Kashipur) announced that in the coming year they will replace the group-discussion round with a common written analysis test to evaluate communication and comprehension skill. The seven older IIMs did not announce plans to change the admission process.

The admissions for the two-year full-time programme is done by shortlisting based on CAT scores in conjunction with candidate profile suitability. This is followed by evaluation of essays and a panel-interview round. The quality of prior work experience and future leadership potential is a critical factor in the selections.

=== Reservation policy ===
IIMs also follow a quota system, as per the provisions of the Indian constitution. As per the provisions, 15% of the seats are reserved for students of Scheduled Castes, and 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes. Since 2008, the Other Backward Classes have also been given 27% reservation and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) have up to 10% reservation, after the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of relevant government regulation. The provisions are being implemented in a phased manner due to resource constraints. All aspirants have to take the Common Admission Test which consists of an objective-type exam, a group-discussion round, and personal interviews, with the cut-off for reserved-category candidates being possibly lower than for general-category candidates. Once admitted to a programme, a reserved category student has to meet all the criteria for completing the programme as a general-category student. Regular counselling sessions, extra classes, and tutorials, by senior students, for needy students are a regular feature of the IIMs. IIMs provide financial support to needy and deserving students in the form of scholarships.

== Course Fees ==

=== Post-graduate program fees ===
In 2004, IIM fees were adjusted by the HRE to annually.

However as of 2023 the total fees for the 2-year program, ranged from to Inflation in India has been cited as one of the reasons for the fee hikes at IIMs.

The fees of the college is influenced by the age and performance of the institute. For example IIM C, the oldest IIM in the country had a total course fees of for the academic year 2022-24. While IIM Jammu, the youngest IIM had a total course fees of .

=== Executive program fees ===
The IIMs also have several executive programs for working executives and professionals. The full-time executive program at IIM Udaipur launched in 2019 had a fees of while the data analytics program was . The same year IIM Lucknow&#x27;s 6-month data analytics program costs while its analytics program for finance professionals costed .

=== Profit Margin of the IIMs===

The following data pertains to the older six IIMs (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Kolkatta, Lucknow, Indore, Kozhikode):
As IIMs are considered as not-for-profit institutions, IIMs do not pay any &#x27;corporate tax&#x27; to the Income Tax Department, Government of India. In 2023, the corporate tax in India was approximately 25% in the 2020s.

In 2023, the fee charged by the older six IIMs (ABCLIK) were in the range of approximately 21 - 26 lakhs for the two year full-time PG programme/ MBA. The fee charged by these IIMs were 22-26 times India&#x27;s annual per capita income (Rs. 96,522 in 2022-23, at constant prices). Globally, this places IIMs amongst any of the institutions that charge the highest fee from its citizens, with reference to the annual per capita income of the nation.

In 2016, a constitution bench of the Supreme Court of India mentioned that “&quot;Education is... ...a noble ‘occupation’... those who establish and are managing the educational institutions are not expected to indulge in profiteering or commercialise this noble activity.&quot;” The Supreme Court also mentioned that “&quot;... the occupation of education cannot be treated at par with other economic activities.&quot;”.

<doc id="272510" wikidata="Q358527" url="?curid=272510" title="Transmitter power output">
<text>In radio transmission, transmitter power output (TPO) is the actual amount of power (in watts) of radio frequency (RF) energy that a transmitter produces at its output.

TPO is a concept related to effective radiated power (ERP), but refers to the power output of a transmitter, without accounting for antenna gain.
The ERP for VHF/UHF transmitters is normally more than the TPO, for LF/MF transmitters it has nearly the same value, while for VLF transmitters it may be less.

==Signal formula==
The radio antenna&#x27;s design focuses the signal, creating gain and increasing the ERP. There is also some loss (negative gain) from the feedline, which reduces some of the TPO to the antenna by both resistance and by radiating a small part of the signal.

The basic equation relating transmitter to effective power is: 

::formula_1
Note that in this formula the Antenna Gain is expressed with reference to a tuned dipole (dBd)

<text>The FM broadcast band is a range of radio frequencies used for FM broadcasting by radio stations. The range of frequencies used differs between different parts of the world. In Europe and Africa (defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1) and in Australia and New Zealand, it spans from 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the Americas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in Japan uses 76 to 95 MHz, and in Brazil, 76 to 108 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.9 to 74.0 MHz, although these countries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of Russia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have changed to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band.

Narrow band Frequency Modulation was developed and demonstrated by Hanso Idzerda in 1919.

Wide band Frequency modulation radio originated in the United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American electrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not become widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s.

Frequency-modulated radio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this article are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to 300 MHz.

==CCIR band plan==

===Center frequencies===
While all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz.

An ITU conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz channel spacings throughout Europe.
* Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.
* Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad or importing receivers, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.
* A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.
* The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM&#x27;s capture effect and receiver selectivity.

===ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering===
The original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong used the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was changed to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from &quot;200&quot; (center frequency 87.9 MHz) to &quot;300&quot; (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers are rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government.
The center frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The frequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz), is used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio tuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and sold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7 MHz, so that TV channel 6&#x27;s audio at 87.75 MHz (±10 kHz) could be received while driving. This is largely no longer possible due to the 2009 digital television transition, though in 2023 the FCC authorized fourteen low-powered Channel 6 television stations to continue to operate radio services indefinitely.

In the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of 87.9–91.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the &quot;reserved band&quot;, exclusively for non-commercial educational (&quot;NCE&quot;) stations. The other channels (92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221–300) may be used by both commercial and non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this reservation does not apply; Mexico introduced a reservation of 106.1–107.9 MHz for community and indigenous stations in 2014, though dozens of stations are grandfathered due to lack of space to relocate them.)

Originally, the American Federal Communications Commission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be assigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one geographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7, etc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7 etc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM broadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated power (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300 feet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other frequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW, 2,000 feet), depending on which zone it was in.

In the late 1980s, the FCC switched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently operating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and change antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six kilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late 2004, a station can be &quot;squeezed in&quot; anywhere as long as the location and class conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-adjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.

In 2017, Brazil laid the groundwork to reclaim channels 5 and 6 (76.1–87.5 MHz) for sound broadcasting use and required new radio receivers to be able to tune into the new extended band (, abbreviated eFM). Five transmitters of public broadcaster Brazil Communication Company were the first extended-band stations to begin broadcasts on May 7, 2021.

In 2023, Chile announced the expansion of the FM band to 76-108 MHz as part of the analog TV shutdown, scheduled for April 2024.

===Deviation and bandpass===
Normally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and subcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150 kHz total (±75 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent-channel interference on the band. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-stereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by the subcarriers. Some stations may limited to (±50 kHz) deviation in order to reduce transmitted bandwidth so that additional stations can be squeezed in.

==OIRT bandplan==
The OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.8 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Soviet Union and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries of the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe (OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100 (later 104) MHz broadcast band—in line with Western Europe.

The lower portion of the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer reach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for reaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception. In a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate interference from skywaves.

Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as early as the 1980s in some East European countries. Following the collapse of the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as private stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of equipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission networks.

Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM band, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the USSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the lack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia.

Countries which still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, and Turkmenistan.

In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning of the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally coordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in the VHF band in Geneva, 1984. Allocated frequencies are still valid and are used in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into operation on 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984. Three years later, there were eleven transmitters in service across the country, including three in the Prague neighborhood of Žižkov. In 1988, the plan was to set up 270 transmitters in 45 locations eventually. The transition was finished in 1993.

In Poland all OIRT broadcast transmitters were closed down at the end of 1999.

Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in 2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur radio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform propagation and interference experiments in the 70–70.5 MHz band.

In Belarus, only government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All stations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main purpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment.

In 2014, Russia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the &quot;western&quot;) FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to reach more listeners.

Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based on 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to reduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other atmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However, multipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band.

Stereo is generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process called polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25 kHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal structure: L + R --&gt; 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R.

The 4-meter band (70–70.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is entirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band (50–54 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there is an &quot;opening&quot; into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing because the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single broadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the band.

The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within the 87.5–108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D therefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to make full use of this band for audio broadcasting.

==Japanese bandplan==

The FM band in Japan is 76–95 MHz (previously 76–90). The 90–108 MHz section was used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel is 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to slightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations that can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial radio stations are forced to use AM.

Many Japanese radios are capable of receiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same model can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz, the frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the radio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode or other internal component.

Conventional analog-tuned (dial &amp; pointer) radios were formerly marked with &quot;TV Sound&quot; in the 76–88 section. If these radios were sold in the US, for example, the 76–88 section would be marked TV sound for VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88–108 section band as normal FM. The compatibility of &quot;TV sound&quot; with conventional FM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception of the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use analog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021.

Second-hand automobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM band, and importers often fit a &quot;converter&quot; to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9 MHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing an incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in undesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular international FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese band (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert modes), and the car&#x27;s antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some converters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical frequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the 102–108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car radios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow pass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better solution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the country where the car will be used.
Australia had a similar situation with Australian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was intending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due to CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in Australia for 76 to 90 MHz.

==Historic U.S. bandplan==

In the 1930s investigations were begun into establishing radio stations transmitting on &quot;Very High Frequency&quot; (VHF) assignments above 30 MHz. In October 1937, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced new frequency allocations, which included a band of experimental and educational &quot;Apex&quot; stations, that consisted of 75 channels spanning from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz. Like the existing AM band these stations employed amplitude modulation, however the 40 kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times as much as the 10 kHz spacing on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming.

Also during the 1930s Edwin Howard Armstrong developed a competing transmission technology, &quot;wide-band frequency modulation&quot;, which was promoted as being superior to AM transmissions, in particular due to its high-fidelity and near immunity to static interference. In May 1940, largely as the result of Armstrong&#x27;s efforts, the FCC decided to eliminate the Apex band, and authorized an FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50 MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. There was significant interest in the new FM band by station owners, however, construction restrictions that went into place during World War II limited the growth of the new service.

Following the end of the war, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of tropospheric and Sporadic E propagation, which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which was headed by David Sarnoff, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies in order to avoid this potential problem. Armstrong charged that this reassignment had the covert goal of disrupting FM radio development, however RCA&#x27;s proposal prevailed, and on June 27, 1945 the FCC announced the reassignment of the FM band to 90 channels from 88–106 MHz, which was soon expanded to 100 channels from 88–108 MHz, with the first 20 channels reserved for educational stations. A period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both the original &quot;low&quot; and new &quot;high&quot; FM bands followed, which ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time all low band transmissions had to end.

In 1978 one additional frequency reserved for educational stations, 87.9 MHz, was allocated. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76–88 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009). This proposed allocation would have effectively assigned frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76 MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band. Several low-power television stations colloquially known as &quot;Franken-FMs&quot; operated primarily as radio stations on channel 6, using the 87.7 MHz audio carrier of that channel as a radio station receivable on most FM receivers configured to cover the whole of Band II, from 2009 to 2021; since then, a reduced number have received special temporary authority to carry a special audio carrier on their ATSC 3.0 signals to continue the status quo.

==FM radio switch-off==
With the gradual adoption of digital radio broadcasting (e.g. HD Radio, DAB+) radio, some countries have planned and started an FM radio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to discontinue FM as a result.

<text>The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) is a trade association and lobby group representing the interests of commercial and non-commercial over-the-air radio and television broadcasters in the United States. The NAB represents more than 8,300 terrestrial radio and television stations as well as broadcast networks.

As of 2022, the president and CEO of the NAB is Curtis LeGeyt.

==Founding==

The NAB was founded as the National Association of Radio Broadcasters (NARB) in April 1923 at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. The association&#x27;s founder and first president was Eugene F. McDonald Jr., who also launched the Zenith corporation. In 1951 it changed its name to the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (NARTB) to include the television industry. In 1958 it adopted its current name, &quot;National Association of Broadcasters&quot;.

==Commercial radio==
The NAB worked to establish a commercial radio system in the United States. The system was set up in August 1928 with the establishment of General Order 40—a radio reallocation scheme by the Federal Radio Commission which awarded the choicest frequencies and broadcast times to the then-emerging commercial radio industry. In the wake of General Order 40, a loose coalition of educators, nonprofit broadcasters, labor unions, and religious groups coalesced to oppose the NAB and their allies through the 1920s and 1930s, and to develop a public, nonprofit, license-funded radio system without commercials (similar to what happened with the BBC). The coalition claimed that the commercial industry would only promote profitable programming, thereby reducing the quality and future potential of radio broadcasting.

Not having the political connections, resources, or publicity of the NAB and the commercial radio industry, the non-profit coalition eventually lost the fight with the passage of the Communications Act of 1934.

The National Independent Broadcasters were formed in 1939 as part of the NAB, to represent stations that were not associated with any network, but the group split off in 1941.

==Satellite radio==
Many satellite radio enthusiasts have criticized the NAB for lobbying against legislation approvals for those services. The NAB protested the FCC&#x27;s approval of both satellite radio services in the United States—XM and Sirius—and furthermore criticized the 2008 merger of the two companies, calling the merged company a &quot;potential monopoly&quot;.

==Digital transition==
In 2005, the NAB, together with the Association for Maximum Service Television Stations, Inc. (MSTV), commenced development of a prototype high quality, low cost digital-to-analog converter box for terrestrial digital television reception. The result of this project was a specification for the converter box, which was then adopted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as a technical requirement for eligible converter boxes for the Administration&#x27;s Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Coupon Program.

==White space==
The NAB has lobbied against the use of white spaces, unused broadcast spectrum lying between broadcast channels, for wireless broadband internet and other digital use. The NAB has claimed that use of white space will interfere with existing broadcast spectrum, even though tests by the Federal Communications Commission at levels far stronger than that being advocated for in policy circles have not supported such claims. Indeed, the FCC has recommended the use of white spaces for broadband and other digital use.
In 2011 the NAB funded an advertising campaign titled &quot;The Future of TV&quot;, advocating for the private ownership of the spectrum, framed as a threat to free television.

==Free TV campaign==
In mid-2014, an NAB advertising campaign against a Congressional threat appeared, advocating viewers to defeat a cable-TV lobby.

==Gatherings==

NAB&#x27;s annual spring convention is the NAB Show. It typically draws over 100,000 industry professionals. NAB also manages the NAB Radio Show which is held each autumn and draws over 3,000 radio professionals. At the 2010 and 2011 NAB shows, popular technology included stereoscopic video and editing software—a demand inspired by James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;; point-of-view cameras, and DSLR cameras boasting shallow Depth of Field. Other strides in nonlinear editing technology included archival film restoration, digital audio mixing improvements, motion stabilization of hand-held footage and rotoscoping with one click. 

The annual NAB Show returned to Las Vegas April 23-27, 2022, after a two-year absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary attendance figures indicated the show attracted more than 50,000 visitors from 155 countries.

==Censorship==

In 1952, the NAB created the Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters, which banned profanity, the negative portrayal of family life, irreverence for God and religion, illicit sex, drunkenness and biochemical addiction, presentation of cruelty, detailed techniques of crime, the use of horror for its own sake, and the negative portrayal of law enforcement officials, among others. It was enforced by a committee appointed by President of the NAB.

After the courts struck down the Code as unconstitutional in 1983, the NAB board of directors issued a brief &quot;Statement of Principles of Radio and Television Broadcasters&quot; that encourages broadcasters to &quot;exercise responsible and careful judgment&quot; in the selection of material relating to violence, drug abuse, and sex. 

On March 1, 2022 the NAB called &quot;on broadcasters to cease carrying any state-sponsored programming with ties to the Russian government&quot; in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine the week prior.

==Hall of Fame inductees==

==NAB awards==
The NAB presents several annual awards:
* NAB Marconi Radio Awards, to the country&#x27;s top radio stations and personalities
* NAB National Radio Award, to an outstanding individual leader in the radio industry
* NAB Crystal Radio Awards, to radio stations achieving excellence in community service
* NAB Engineering Achievement Awards, to an individual for their outstanding accomplishments in the broadcast industry
*NAB Distinguished Service Award, for broadcasters who have made a significant and lasting contribution to American broadcasting.

Organizations similar to the NAB exist in individual U.S. states, including Georgia Association of Broadcasters (GAB) in Georgia, and the Illinois Broadcasters Association (IBA), in Illinois. In Canada, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) has a similar role.

<doc id="272536" wikidata="Q1854601" url="?curid=272536" title="North London line">
<text>The North London line is a railway line which passes through the inner suburbs of London, England between Richmond in the south-west and Stratford in the east, avoiding central London. Its route is a rough semicircle.

Although much of it originated as part of the North London Railway, the current route is the result of a series of amalgamations, closures and reopenings, and has a mix of third-rail and overhead electrical power supply. It remains heavily used by freight services in addition to the Mildmay line passenger service on the London Overground. Between Richmond and Gunnersbury, London Underground&#x27;s District line shares tracks with the Mildmay line; the entire route is owned and maintained by Network Rail.

TfL took over the line in 2007 and introduced new stock as well as putting the line on the Tube map. It closed for four months in 2010 between and and had a reduced service for another year to allow platform extensions and signalling upgrades.

In November 2024, the North London and West London sections of the London Overground were named the &quot;Mildmay line&quot; (to honour the Mildmay Mission Hospital which treated victims of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s) and are coloured light blue on the Tube map.

== History ==

=== Formation ===

The North London line between Richmond and North Woolwich derived from five connecting sections which were opened over 25 years from 1846:

* The easternmost section opened as the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway in 1846/7 between Stratford and North Woolwich. The later construction of the Royal Victoria Dock necessitated a swing-bridge on the original route south of Canning Town which was rerouted in 1850 via Custom House and the Connaught Tunnel. The original route was retained as the Silvertown Tramway, a local freight line connected at both ends to the new main line.
* The main central section opened from 1850 to 1852 as the East &amp; West India Docks &amp; Birmingham Junction Railway (renamed the North London Railway (NLR) in 1853). This gave a link from the Euston main line near Primrose Hill to the docks at Poplar via Bow.
* In the west, the North &amp; South Western Junction Railway was opened in 1853 from to a junction with the Hounslow Loop Line near .
* The last link in the east was opened between the NLR near Victoria Park and Stratford in 1854.
* To obviate NLR trains running on the busy Euston main line, the Hampstead Junction Railway was opened from the NLR at to Willesden via in 1860.
* To give the NLR direct access to the City of London, the City extension to Broad Street was opened from in 1865.
* The final part of the route was the opening of a link from to Richmond by the London &amp; South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1869.

=== Developments ===
The line from Broad Street to Kew Bridge and Richmond was electrified by the LNWR in 1916 on the fourth-rail DC system.

In 1944, passenger services on the NLR Poplar branch ceased. Freight traffic continued on the branch to the docks on the Isle of Dogs until 1980. The trackbed of the southern part of the branch, from Poplar to Bow, was used for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) branch to Stratford.

The service was listed for closure in the 1963 Beeching Report, with losses claimed as being £69,000 per year (). It was saved after a huge campaign. The line was Grant Aided under the Transport Act 1968 and came under threat when the Conservative Government of 1970–71 proposed to reduce Grant Aid funding. That threat, eventually lifted, led to the founding of a new campaign group, the North London Line Committee, which tried to work with British Rail management to promote the service.

In 1979, the North Woolwich to Stratford service was extended to Camden Road as the Crosstown Linkline service, using the same Cravens-built diesel multiple unit trains. There were no intermediate stations until, in 1980, Hackney Wick was opened, near the site of the former Victoria Park station and Hackney Central was re-opened; then Homerton re-opened in 1985 (the two latter stations had closed in 1944). New platforms were built at West Ham for interchange with the adjacent Underground station.

The part of the line between the West London and East Coast Main Lines was proposed in the mid-1990s to be used for Regional Eurostar services, which would travel from the lines into Waterloo International station to points north of London. A proposed link to Heathrow Airport would have also used the line between Willesden Junction and Acton. Regional Eurostar was eventually cancelled.

=== Rolling stock ===
The line was originally operated by steam-hauled trains which were replaced after electrification by London and North Western Railway EMUs built from 1914 and augmented by later EMUs built in the 1930s by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. These had all been replaced by the early 1960s with dedicated short-wheelbase trains (shared with the Watford DC line) built by the Southern Region at Eastleigh (using underframes built at Ashford) from 1957 which were later designated by British Railways as Class 501. These were succeeded by Southern Region Class 416 EMU for a short period, these units being allocated to Selhurst depot in south London. Class 416 trains were in turn succeeded by Class 313 EMUs, which worked the route until 2010 when London Overground introduced Class 378 &quot;Capitalstar&quot; four-car dual-voltage electric trains compatible with both 750 V DC third-rail and 25 kV AC overhead power sources, and all of these units were by 2017 operating in 5-car formations to address the additional demand on the route.

=== Closures ===

In 1986, Broad Street station closed and the Tottenham Hale–Stratford link and the station at Lea Bridge ceased to be used by regular passenger trains. The line between Dalston and North Woolwich was electrified on the third-rail system and Broad Street services were diverted to North Woolwich using former Southern Region 2-EPB types built in the 1950s. The two-car trains soon proved too small and were replaced by three-car Class 313 electric multiple units. The new service was branded by British Rail as the &quot;North London Link&quot;, and some signs using this name still exist.

In December 2006, as with the Poplar branch (see above), the line between Stratford and North Woolwich was permanently closed to make a way for a future DLR extension from to Stratford International (which opened on February 2011). The section south of Canning Town was not used by the DLR, as it is largely duplicated by the DLR King George V branch. Instead, the section became part of the Elizabeth line&#x27;s branch to , which opened in May 2022. The section south of Stratford had always been the &#x27;Cinderella&#x27; end of the line, in that when there were operating problems it was common for trains to be turned short at Stratford.

=== Poor performance before the TfL takeover ===
Despite favourable performance figures, the North London line used to be regarded by frequent travellers as offering a poor and unreliable service with extremely congested trains which were often cancelled shortly before they were due to arrive. A 2006 London Assembly report described the current service as &quot;shabby, unreliable, unsafe and overcrowded&quot;, proposing the transfer of the service to Transport for London (TfL) as a solution to improve the quality of the service due to upgrade plans which coincided with the extension of the East London line.

=== TfL ===
The North London line, as part of Silverlink, along with the West London line, Gospel Oak to Barking line and the Watford DC line, was transferred to Transport for London (TfL) in 2007 to form its new London Overground service. TfL began to remodel stations, integrate lines and, following the transfer and extension of the East London line, created an orbital rail service. TfL also brought in new trains and the lines, which previously appeared on tube maps following a public campaign, gained their own colour.

TfL closed the line in February 2010 between and for the installation of a new signalling system and the rebuilding or extension of platforms to allow four-car trains to run on the line; most NLL platforms had been reduced in usable length (where they had not been originally short) in the late 1960s when services were reduced to three-carriage trains only. The line reopened on 1 June 2010 with a reduced service and none on Sundays, and with the upgrade work completed, the full seven-day service resumed on 22 May 2011.

=== Former services ===
In addition to the primary – Richmond service, there were services that linked Broad Street with and on the Watford DC line. Most of these were routed via the line between and Camden Road, calling at although some travelled via and joined the DC line at . Prior to electrification in the 1960s, other services ran as far as Tring on the West Coast Main Line via Primrose Hill and Willesden Junction Main Line (now demolished). By the time that Broad Street closed in 1986, the Watford services operated only in the rush hours; they were diverted to Liverpool Street by way of a new link in Hackney, known as the Graham Road Curve. Trains were frequently cancelled owing to rolling stock shortages; these circumstances had begun some years earlier with service reductions and scrapping of trains in the late 1960s, followed in later years by closure of depots at Croxley Green and Stonebridge Park preventing stabling of spare stock. Along with what eventually became a lack of trains timetabled to serve Liverpool Street to match the needs of rush-hour passengers, this inevitably led to falling patronage. British Rail applied to close the service in 1990, and the last trains ran two years later.

In 2000, Anglia Railways started a service between and , utilising parts of the North London line. The service was called London Crosslink and ran up to five times a day at roughly two-hourly intervals. The service called only at principal stations such as , and . On the North London line, the trains called only at , , Camden Road (some services), and Willesden Junction. The service was withdrawn in 2002.

The AC electrification of the eastern part of the North London line uses the previously unelectrified northern pair of tracks, which were also partially singled at the same time. Between and Highbury &amp; Islington, there is a line which links to the East Coast Main Line at . This used to carry passenger trains to and from various main line stations (such as Edgware, Alexandra Palace, , and others) over part of the North London line to Broad Street Station; however, with the electrification of the Great Northern Electrics suburban lines in 1976, trains were diverted into and London King&#x27;s Cross stations, so since then this link has only been used for freight trains. It too was singled concurrent with the AC electrification of the eastern part of the North London line.

== Route ==
=== Stations ===
=== Track ===
Most of the line runs in a curve across north London. Only and stations at the western end are south of the River Thames. The river crossing is made by Kew Railway Bridge on tracks which are shared with the London Underground District line. The location of the eastern extremity has varied over the years. Between 1944 and 1986, it was at Broad Street station; then it was switched to . Later, it was cut back to . A tunnel, the Hampstead Heath tunnel, runs under Hampstead between and . The line is double track throughout, with quadruple track between York Way (near St. Pancras) and Arundel Square (near Highbury and Islington). The former North Woolwich branch included a section of single track between Custom House and North Woolwich stations, and the Broad Street branch was at one time formed of quadruple track.

During the February–May 2010 blockade, the , and stations were rebuilt to allow the extended East London line to serve Highbury &amp; Islington on fully segregated tracks on the south side of the cutting. Under the reinstated four-track arrangement, the North London line runs parallel to the double-track East London line from Dalston Kingsland to Highbury and Islington. The line then becomes quadruple-track at Arundel Square, with passenger services using the inner pair of tracks and freight services using the outer pair, before the line reduces to double track at York Way, near St. Pancras.

=== Traction current supply ===
Originally, the line was electrified in 1914–15 using the fourth rail +420 V / -210 V system, as used by London Underground. This was changed in the 1970s to +630 V / 0 V; the trains (then EMUs of a design unique to this and the DC line) were modified to the same basic traction supply arrangements as SR 3rd rail EMUs; the centre/negative current rail was removed except where coincident four-rail running was required between Richmond and Gunnersbury for the Underground trains that share this section, the centre rail there being bonded to the running rail used for current return. The line is now electrified using that same third rail system from Richmond to , but with overhead lines now used from Acton Central to Stratford. The line into Broad Street used third-rail supply and, when the through service to North Woolwich started in 1985, trains used the third rail throughout. When the trains were replaced a few years later by dual-voltage Class 313 trains, it became possible to use the overhead line equipment which had been added to parts of the line for the benefit of freight trains; there had been some unexpected difficulties with earth currents from the third rail system which this overcame. This use was steadily extended, and trains had to make a number of changes between traction current supplies during their short journey; these were at Hackney Wick, Dalston Kingsland, Camden Road and Acton Central. With the final upgrade of the line between Camden Road and Stratford, the need to change traction current systems on this stretch was eliminated, and now the only changeover takes place at Acton Central for the short section to Richmond. The line ran on third rail throughout the 1980s until 1996 when it was closed for conversion to overhead lines. In 2010, the last of the third-rail sections around Camden Road station were completely removed.

== Connections ==
The line crosses, or comes into contact with, a very large number of other railway lines, especially lines radiating from central London. This does provide opportunities to move between different sectors of suburban London without having to enter the central zone.

=== Interchanges shown on the tube map ===
* at , to and from South Western Railway services including the Kingston loop line.
* at , connecting NLL services north of the station to District line services east of the station.
* at , with the Bakerloo line, Watford DC line and West London line.
* at , with the Jubilee line and Thameslink stations, each situated a short walk either side of the NLL station.
* at , to and from the Suffragette line of London Overground.
* at , to and from the Victoria line, the East London line and Great Northern services to Moorgate, Finsbury Park and the Great Northern Line.
* at , with the East London line.
* at which is linked via direct passenger walkway to Hackney Downs station for London Overground and Greater Anglia services to and from Liverpool Street.
* at , to and from the Central line, Great Eastern Main line Greater Anglia services between East Anglia and , the Jubilee line, and Docklands Light Railway.

=== Other interchanges ===
* at , 220 m south of on the Jubilee line
* at , about 400 m north of on the Metropolitan and Jubilee lines
* at , about 400 m north-east of on the Northern line
* at , 670 m north of on the Piccadilly line
* at , 1 km south-east of on the Piccadilly and District lines.

==== Alternative stations – lines merge nearby ====
* is 225 m north of ; the two lines converge at the next station west (Canonbury)

=== Former interchanges ===
* At North Woolwich, passengers could cross the Thames via the Woolwich foot tunnel or take the free ferry to Woolwich Arsenal station for connections on the North Kent line to the Medway towns, Gravesend, Dartford, Sidcup, Abbey Wood, Blackheath, Lewisham, Greenwich and Central London. This service is now provided by King George V DLR station which offers direct rail services to Woolwich Arsenal from North Woolwich, providing quick interchange to services on the North Kent line.

== Current operations ==

=== Service levels ===
Trains run seven days a week, from approximately 06:00 (09:00 Sundays) until 23:30. There are eight trains per hour between Stratford and Willesden Junction, four of which continue to Clapham Junction and four to Richmond.

The introduction of new four-car, air-conditioned trains, combined with improved signalling and passenger information, has dramatically overhauled the service, making it an effective alternative to travelling through central London for many orbital journeys.

=== East London line extension ===
From March 2011, the extended East London line connects to the NLL, with ELL services joining the line west of , running to .

=== Five-car operation ===
Transport for London extended platforms at some stations along the route to prepare the line for five-car operations in 2015, a project aimed at combating overcrowding on the line. The project was successfully completed and the first five-car trains started to run in summer 2015.

=== Renaming ===
In July 2023, TFL announced that it would be giving each of the six Overground services unique names by the end of 2024. In February 2024, it was confirmed that the North London / West London section would be named the &quot;Mildmay line&quot; (to honour the Mildmay Hospital in Bethnal Green, which treated victims of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s) and would be coloured sky blue on the updated network map. The renaming was implemented in November 2024.

== Proposed developments ==
=== Maiden Lane ===
Maiden Lane station may be reopened by Camden Council; however, the Office of Rail Regulation has not included this in the current plans.

=== Crossrail to Hounslow ===
Hounslow council has proposed that part of the North London line be used as a branch of Crossrail to , which would see Crossrail services serving and . It was not included in the initial Crossrail bill but could form part of a later extension.

=== Old Oak Common Lane ===

Under the former government&#x27;s plans for High Speed 2 line from London Euston to Birmingham, a new station called was to be built by 2025 serving the North London line, West London line, High Speed 2 and Crossrail. The new government supports the idea after it had been opposed at first.

=== North Acton ===
Another new station at is proposed for interchange with the Central line, but it might require the Central line station being moved to the east.

=== High Speed 2 ===
The planned link between the proposed High Speed 2 line and the existing High Speed 1 line would have used the North London line alignment around Camden Road station, which might have reduced the existing or future capacity of the line. Its heavy investment in the line and the passenger growth on it has made Transport for London against the alignment&#x27;s use as a link between the two High Speed lines. That link has now been removed from the parliamentary bill.

=== Camden Highline ===

A new park utilising the former railway alignment between Camden Town and King&#x27;s Cross was given planning permission in January 2023.

== Closed stations ==

Closed stations apart from those on the closed sections of the line are:
* 
* 

=== City Extension ===
On 1 November 1865 the NLR opened its City Extension, mostly on a viaduct from a triangular junction at Dalston to Broad Street in the city, with these stations:
* 
* 

The extension closed on 30 June 1986, but although the track was lifted the viaduct remained in place. The route was re-opened in 2010 as part of the extended East London line, which, like the North London line, is operated by London Overground.

=== North Woolwich section ===
On 10 December 2006, the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway line between Stratford and North Woolwich was closed to allow building of a Docklands Light Railway line to Stratford International between and . Part of the south end of the closed section is used by the Elizabeth line.

NLL stations closed were:
* 
* 

DLR and Jubilee line services are not affected at the first three of those stations.

The DLR line to Stratford International uses the former NLL low-level platforms at Stratford. NLL trains now terminate at new platforms on the north side of the high-level station.

<doc id="272541" wikidata="Q1505689" url="?curid=272541" title="Tenosynovitis">
<text>Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the fluid-filled sheath (called the synovium) that surrounds a tendon, typically leading to joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Tenosynovitis can be either infectious or noninfectious. Common clinical manifestations of noninfectious tenosynovitis include de Quervain tendinopathy and stenosing tenosynovitis (more commonly known as trigger finger).

==Signs and symptoms==

Infectious tenosynovitis in 2.5% to 9.4% of all hand infections. Kanavel&#x27;s cardinal signs are used to diagnose infectious tenosynovitis. They are: tenderness to touch along the flexor aspect of the finger, fusiform enlargement of the affected finger, the finger being held in slight flexion at rest, and severe pain with passive extension. Fever may also be present, but is uncommon.

==Pathogenesis==

Infectious tenosynovitis is the infection of closed synovial sheaths in the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is usually caused by trauma, but bacteria can spread from other sites of the body. Although tenosynovitis usually affects the flexor tendon of the fingers, the disease can also affect the extensor tendons occasionally. The clinical presentation is therefore as acute infection following trauma. The infection can be mono- or polymicrobial and can vary depending on the nature of the trauma. The most common pathogenic agent is &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; introduced from the skin. Other bacteria linked to infectious tenosynovitis include &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot; (associated with animal bites), &quot;Eikenella&quot; spp. (associated with IV drug use), and &quot;Mycobacterium marinum&quot; (associated with wounds exposed to fresh or salt water). Additionally, sexually active patients are at risk for hematogenous spread due to &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; (see infectious arthritis).

Common noninfectious tenosynovitis are: stenosing tenosynovitis, intersection syndrome, extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tenosynovitis, de Quervain&#x27;s and fourth compartment tenosynovitis.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of tenosynovitis is typically made clinically after a thorough patient history and physical exam. Aspirated fluid can also be cultured to identify the infectious organism. X-rays are typically unremarkable but can help rule out a broken bone or a foreign body

==Treatment==

The mainstay of treatment for infectious tenosynovitis includes symptom relief, antibiotic therapy, and surgery. Early recognition of the disease with early initiation of antibiotics are important for better range of movement of the affected finger. Minimally invasive procedures into the flexor tendon sheath such as catheter irrigation give better outcomes (74% chance of good outcome) when compared to open surgery (26% chance of good outcome). However, wound irrigation with antibiotics has no clear benefits. Most infectious tenosynovitis cases should be managed with tendon sheath irrigation and drainage, with or without debridement of surrounding necrotic tissue, along with treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In severe cases, amputation may even be necessary to prevent the further spread of infection. Following surgical intervention, antibiotic therapy is continued and adjusted based on the results of the fluid culture.

==Prognosis==

The earlier the condition is identified, the better the chance of getting full range of motion of the finger. However, finger stiffness, Boutonniere deformity, deep space infection, tendon necrosis, adhesions, persistent infection, and need for amputation of the finger can occur. Tendon adhesion and finger stiffness are caused by the violation of the flexor tendon sheath.

<text>Trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, is a disorder characterized by catching or locking of the involved finger in full or near full flexion, typically with force. There may be tenderness in the palm of the hand near the last skin crease (distal palmar crease). The name &quot;trigger finger&quot; may refer to the motion of &quot;catching&quot; like a trigger on a gun. The ring finger and thumb are most commonly affected.
The problem is generally idiopathic (no known cause). People with diabetes might be relatively prone to trigger finger. The pathophysiology is enlargement of the flexor tendon and the A1 pulley of the tendon sheath. While often referred to as a type of stenosing tenosynovitis (which implies inflammation) the pathology is mucoid degeneration. Mucoid degeneration is when fibrous tissue, such as tendon, has less organized collagen, more abundant extracellular matrix, and changes in the cells (fibrocytes) to act and look more like cartilage cells (chondroid metaplasia). Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and signs after excluding other possible causes.
Trigger digits can resolve without treatment. Treatment options that are disease modifying include steroid injections and surgery. Splinting immobilization of the finger may or may not be disease modifying.

Symptoms include catching or locking of the involved finger when it is forcefully flexed. There may be tenderness in the palm of the hand near the last skin crease (distal palmar crease). Often a nodule can be felt in this area. There is some evidence that idiopathic trigger finger behaves differently in people with diabetes.

==Causes==
It is important to distinguish association and causation. The vast majority of trigger digits are idiopathic, meaning there is no known cause. However, recent publications indicate that diabetes and high blood sugar levels increases the risk of developing trigger finger.

Some speculate that repetitive forceful use of a digit leads to narrowing of the fibrous digital sheath in which it runs, but there is little scientific data to support this theory. The relationship of trigger finger to work activities is debatable and there are arguments for and against a relationship to hand use with no experimental evidence supporting a relationship.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is made on interview and physical examination. More than one finger may be affected at a time. It is most common in the thumb and ring finger. The triggering more often occurs while gripping an object firmly or during sleep when the palm of the subject’s hand remains closed for an extended period of time, presumably because the enlargement of the tendon is maximum when the finger is not being used. Upon waking, the affected person may have to force the triggered fingers open with their other hand. In some, this can be a daily occurrence.

==Treatment==

Depending on the number of affected digits and the clinical severity of the condition, Corticosteroid injections can cure trigger digits.

Treatment consists of injection of a corticosteroid such as methylprednisolone often combined with a local anesthetic (lidocaine) at the A1 pulley in the palm. The infiltration of the affected site is straightforward using standard anatomic landmarks. There is evidence that the steroid does not need to enter the sheath. The role of sonographic guidance is therefore debatable.

Injection of the tendon sheath with a corticosteroid is effective over weeks to months in more than half of people. Steroid injection is not effective in people with Type 1 diabetes. If triggering persists 2 months after injection, a second injection can be considered. Most specialists recommend no more than 3 injections because corticosteroids can weaken the tendon and there is a possibility of tendon rupture. 

Triggering is predictably resolved by a relatively simple surgical procedure under local anesthesia. The surgeon will cut the sheath that is restricting the tendon. The patient should be awake in order to confirm adequate release. On occasion, triggering does not resolve until a slip of the FDS (flexor digitorum superficialis) tendon is resected. 

One study suggests that the most cost-effective treatment is up to two corticosteroid injections followed by open release of the first annular pulley. Choosing surgery immediately is an option and can be affordable if done in the office under local anesthesia.

===Surgery===
Trigger digits can be released percutaneously using a needle. This is not used for the thumb where the digital nerves are at greater risk.

====Postoperative outcome====
In some trigger finger patients, tenderness is found in the dorsal proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Dorsal PIP joint tenderness is more common in trigger fingers than previously thought. It is also associated with higher and prolonged levels of postoperative pain after A1 pulley release. Therefore, patients with pre-existing PIP tenderness should be informed about the possibility of sustaining residual minor pain for up to 3 months after surgery.

<text>The little pied cormorant, little shag or kawaupaka (Microcarbo melanoleucos) is a common species of Australasian waterbird, found around the coasts, islands, estuaries, and inland waters of Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Timor-Leste and Indonesia, and around the islands of the south-western Pacific and the subantarctic. It is a small short-billed cormorant usually black above and white below with a yellow bill and small crest, although a mostly black white-throated form predominates in New Zealand. Three subspecies are recognised. Until recently most authorities referred to this species as &quot;Phalacrocorax melanoleucos&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The species is known as the little pied cormorant in Australia, and as the little shag or by the Māori name of kawaupaka in New Zealand. The term white-throated shag is also reserved for the melanistic form there.

The little pied cormorant was originally described by French naturalist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1817. In 1931, American ornithologist James Lee Peters was the first to consider this in a separate genus along with the pygmy cormorant (&quot;M. pygmaeus&quot;), little cormorant (&quot;M. niger&quot;), and the long-tailed cormorant (&quot;M. africanus&quot;). Since then, molecular work by Sibley and Ahlquist showed the little pied and long-tailed cormorants formed a group which had diverged early on from other cormorants. This group of &quot;micro-cormorants&quot; assumed the genus name &quot;Microcarbo&quot;, initially described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;mikros&quot; &quot;small&quot;, and Latin &quot;carbo&quot; &quot;black&quot;. However, most older authorities refer to this species as &quot;Phalacrocorax melanoleucus&quot;.

In the now-extinct Waray language spoken along the Adelaide River in North Arnhem Land, the species was known as mawa.

Three subspecies are commonly recognised:
*&quot;M. m. melanoleucos&quot;. Resident throughout the species range except in New Zealand and the sub-Antarctic islands
*&quot;M. m. brevicauda&quot; Mayr 1931. Endemic to Rennell Island, in the Solomon Islands
*&quot;M. m. brevirostris&quot; Gould 1837 (little shag). Resident throughout New Zealand and regularly seen on sub-Antarctic islands; has bred on Campbell Island. Some authorities treat this form as a distinct species, &quot;P. brevirostris&quot;.

==Description==

The little pied cormorant is a small cormorant measuring with a shorter bill and longer tail than the little black cormorant; it has a small black crest. It is found in two morphs in New Zealand. Subspecies &quot;melanoleucos&quot; and &quot;brevicauda&quot; are found only in a pied morph, black (with a slight green tinge) above and white beneath. This is also found in subspecies &quot;brevirostris&quot;, but in this form the melanistic morph is much more common. In this form the entire plumage is black with a greenish tinge except for the sides of the head, chin, throat and upper neck; the bill is yellow with black on top. Intermediate forms are also found.

The pied form is glossy black above with white face, underparts and thighs. The bill and bare skin around the face are yellow. In both forms the legs and feet are black. The pied form is rare in New Zealand, and is most common there in Northland, where it makes up one in every four birds or so.

Chicks have dark brown down, with pied morph having patches of paler down. Immature birds are a dull blackish brown, with pied morph birds having paler underparts.

The little pied cormorant makes a low cooing during courtship.

Similar species include the black-faced cormorant (slightly larger) and the Australian pied cormorant (substantially larger).

==Distribution and habitat==
The species ranges across New Zealand, from Stewart Island to Northland, and across mainland Australia (although not in the arid interior of the west of the country) and Tasmania. It is also present in Papua New Guinea, Palau, Timor-Leste, the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, and Vanuatu. In eastern Indonesia, the little pied cormorant&#x27;s range includes Sulawesi, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku Islands, and Western New Guinea, with non-breeding birds recorded in Java, Bali, and once off the coast of East Kalimantan. Widespread and common, it lives near bodies of water such as swamps, lakes, lagoons, estuaries and the coastline.

==Feeding==
The little pied cormorant is a benthic feeder, i.e. it finds its prey on the sea floor. It is a solitary feeder, normally diving in relatively shallow water, often near the shore. Dive times are short, around 15 to 20 seconds, with recovery times on the surface of 5 to 10 seconds unless prey are being swallowed. It takes a variety of fish prey but an unusually high proportion (nearly 30% by weight on average, and up to 80% in some individuals) of crustaceans. In New Zealand waters it is most often seen preying on the local flounder and other small flatfish. Eels and insect larvae are also consumed. These are brought to the surface to be swallowed: the bird will sometimes put a fish down on the surface of the water in order to re-orient it and swallow it head first. Because of this habit, they suffer some kleptoparasitism from red-billed gulls.

==Breeding==
Breeding occurs once a year in spring or early summer in southern areas of its range (southern Australia and New Zealand), and after the monsoon in tropical regions. The nest is a platform built of branches and sticks, often still green with leaves in the forks of trees, usually eucalypts that are standing in water. Nests are often located near other waterbirds such as other cormorants, herons, ibises or spoonbills. Four or five pale blue oval eggs measuring 46 x 31 mm are laid. The eggs are covered with a thin layer of lime, giving them a matte white coated appearance. They become increasingly stained with faeces, as does the nest, over the duration of the breeding season.
