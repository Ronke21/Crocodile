<text>The National Firearms Act (NFA), 73rd Congress, Sess. 2, ch. 757, was enacted on June 26, 1934, and currently codified and amended as . The law is an Act of Congress in the United States that, in general, imposes an excise tax on the manufacture and transfer of certain firearms and mandates the registration of those firearms. The NFA is also referred to as Title II of the federal firearms laws, with the Gun Control Act of 1968 (&quot;GCA&quot;) as Title I.

All transfers of ownership of registered NFA firearms must be done through the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record (the &quot;NFA registry&quot;). The NFA also requires that the permanent transport of NFA firearms across state lines by the owner must be reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Temporary transports of some items, most notably suppressors (also referred to as silencers), do not need to be reported.

==Background==
The ostensible impetus for the National Firearms Act of 1934 was the self-imposed gangland crime of the Prohibition era, such as the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre of 1929, and the attempted assassination of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, brought about by alcohol being illegal. Like the current National Firearms Act (NFA), the 1934 Act required NFA firearms to be registered and taxed. The $200 tax was quite prohibitive at the time (). With a few exceptions, the tax amount is unchanged.

Originally, pistols and revolvers were to be regulated as strictly as machine guns; towards that end, cutting down a rifle or shotgun to circumvent the handgun restrictions by making a concealable weapon was taxed as strictly as a machine gun.

Conventional pistols and revolvers were ultimately excluded from the Act before passage, but other concealable weapons were not. Regarding the definition of &quot;firearm&quot;, the language of the statute as originally enacted was as follows:

::The term &quot;firearm&quot; means a shotgun or rifle having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length, or any other weapon, except a pistol or revolver, from which a shot is discharged by an explosive if such weapon is capable of being concealed on the person, or a machine gun, and includes a muffler or silencer for any firearm whether or not such firearm is included within the foregoing definition.

Under the original Act, NFA weapons were machine guns, short-barreled rifles (SBR), short-barreled shotguns (SBS), any other weapons (AOW, i.e., concealable weapons other than pistols or revolvers), and silencers for any type of NFA or non-NFA weapon. Minimum barrel length was soon amended to 16 inches for rimfire rifles and by 1960 had been amended to 16 inches for centerfire rifles as well.

NFA categories have been modified by laws passed by Congress, rulings by the Department of the Treasury, and regulations promulgated by the enforcement agency assigned, known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or ATF.

==Categories of regulated firearms==
The current National Firearms Act (NFA) defines a number of categories of regulated firearms. These weapons are collectively known as NFA firearms and include the following:

;Machine guns: &quot;any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.&quot;

;Short-barreled rifles (SBRs): Includes any firearm with a buttstock and either a rifled barrel less than 16″ long or an overall length under 26&quot;. The overall length is measured with any folding or collapsing stocks in the extended position. The category also includes firearms which came from the factory with a buttstock that was later removed by a third party.

;Short-barreled shotguns (SBSs): Similarly to SBRs, but with either a smoothbore barrel less than 18″ long or a minimum overall length under 26&quot;.

;Suppressors: The legal term for a suppressor is &quot;silencer&quot;, and includes any portable device designed to muffle or disguise the report of a portable firearm, but does not include non-portable devices, such as sound traps used by gunsmiths in their shops which are large and usually bolted to the floor.

;Destructive devices (DDs) – (added to the NFA of 1934 by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968): There are two broad classes of destructive devices: 

=== Any other weapon (AOW) ===

Firearms meeting the definition of &quot;any other weapon&quot;, or AOW, are weapons or devices that can be concealed on the person and from which a shot can be discharged by the energy of an explosive. Many AOWs are disguised devices such as pens, cigarette lighters, knives, cane guns, and umbrella guns. AOWs can be pistols and revolvers with smooth bore barrels (e.g., H&amp;R Handy-Gun, Serbu Super-Shorty) designed or redesigned to fire a fixed shotgun shell. While the above weapons are similar in appearance to weapons made from shotguns, they were originally manufactured in the described configuration rather than modified from existing shotguns. As a result, such weapons do not fit within the definition of shotgun or weapons made from a shotgun.

The AOW definition includes specifically described weapons with combination shotgun and rifle barrels 12 inches or more but less than 18 inches in length from which only a single discharge can be made from either barrel without manual reloading.

The ATF Firearms Technology Branch has issued opinions that when a pistol (such as an AR-type pistol) under 26&quot; in overall length is fitted with a vertical fore-grip, it is no longer &quot;designed, made and intended to fire ... when held in one hand,&quot; and therefore no longer meets the definition of a pistol. Such a firearm then falls only within the definition of &quot;any other weapon&quot; under the NFA.

In 1938, Congress recognized that the Marble Game Getter, a short .22/.410 sporting firearm, had &quot;legitimate use&quot; and did not deserve the stigma of a &quot;gangster weapon&quot; and reduced the $200 tax to one dollar for the Game Getter. In 1960 Congress changed the transfer tax for all AOW category firearms to $5. The transfer tax for machine guns, silencers, SBR and SBS remained at $200.

===Parts associated with NFA items===
In general, certain components that make up an NFA item are considered as regulated. For example, the components of a silencer are considered as &quot;silencers&quot; by themselves and the replacement parts are regulated. However, the repair of original parts without replacement can be done by the original manufacturer, FFL gunsmith, or by the registered owner without being subjected to new registration as long as the serial number and the dimension (caliber) are maintained. The length may be reduced in repair, but cannot be increased. Increasing the length is considered as making a new silencer. &quot;Suppressor&quot; is the term used within the trade/industry literature while the term &quot;silencer&quot; is the commonly used term that appears in the actual wording of the NFA. The terms are often used interchangeably depending on the source quoted.

Suppressors and machine guns are the most heavily regulated. For example, in Ruling 81-4, ATF declared that any AR-15 Drop-in Auto-Sear (DIAS) made after November 1, 1981 is itself a machine gun, and is therefore subject to regulation. While this might seem to mean that pre-1981 sears are legal to possess without registration, ATF closes this loophole in other publications, stating,Regardless of the date of manufacture of a drop in auto sear, possession of such a sear and certain M-16 fire control parts is possession of a machine gun as defined by the NFA. Specifically, these parts are listed as &quot;(a) combination(s) of parts&quot; designed &quot;Solely and exclusively&quot; for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun and are a machine gun as defined in the NFA.ATF machine gun technology letters written between 1980 and 1996 by Edward M. Owen—the then-chief of the ATF technology division defined &quot;solely and exclusively&quot; in all of his published and unpublished machine gun rulings with specific non-ambiguous language.

Owning for the parts needed to assemble other NFA firearms is generally restricted. One individual cannot own or manufacture certain machine gun sear (fire-control) components, unless, he owns a registered machine gun. The M2 carbine trigger pack is such an example of a &quot;combination of parts&quot; that is a machine gun in and of itself. Most of these have been registered as they were pulled from stores of surplus rifles in the early 1960s. In some special cases, exceptions have been determined to these rules by ATF. A semiautomatic firearm which could have a string or shoelace looped around the cocking handle of and then behind and in front of the trigger in such a way as to allow the firearm to be fired automatically is no longer considered a machine gun unless the string is attached in this manner.

Most current fully automatic trigger groups will not fit their semi-automatic firearm look-alike counterparts—the semi-automatic version is specifically constructed to reject the fully automatic trigger group by adding metal in critical places. This addition is required by ATF to prevent easy conversion of Title I firearms into machine guns.

For the civilian possession, all machine guns must have been manufactured and registered with ATF prior to May 19, 1986, to be transferable between citizens. These machine gun prices have drastically escalated in value, especially items like registered sears and conversion-kits. Only a Class-II manufacturer (a FFL holder licensed to manufacture firearms or Type-07 license that has paid a Special Occupational Tax Stamp or SOT) could manufacture machine guns after that date, and they can only be sold to government, law-enforcement, and military entities. Transfer can only be done to other SOT FFL-holders, and such FFL-holders must have a &quot;demonstration letter&quot; from a respective government agency to receive such machine guns. Falsification and/or misuse of the &quot;demo-letter&quot; process can and has resulted in long jail sentences and felony convictions for violators.

Owning both a short barrel and a legal-length rifle could be construed as intent to build an illegal, unregistered SBR. This possibility was contested and won in the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;United States v. Thompson-Center Arms Company&quot;. ATF lost the case, and was unable to prove that possession of a short barrel for the specific pistol configuration of a Thompson Contender is illegal. ATF later released ruling 2011-4 to clarify the legal status of owning such conversion kits.

Removal of a weapon from classification as an NFA firearm, such as the reclassification of the original Broomhandle Mauser with shoulder stock from &quot;short barrel rifle&quot; (SBR) to a curio or relic handgun, changed its status as a Title II NFA firearm but did not change its status as a Title I Gun Control Act firearm.

Muzzle-loading firearms are exempt from the Act (as they are defined as &quot;antique firearms&quot; and are not considered &quot;firearms&quot; under either the GCA or the NFA). Thus, though common muzzle-loading hunting rifles are available in calibers over 0.50 inch, they are not regulated as destructive devices. Muzzle-loading cannon are similarly exempt since the law makes no distinction about the size of muzzle-loading weapons. Thus it is legal for a civilian to build muzzle-loading rifles, pistols, cannon, and mortars with no paperwork. However, ammunition for these weapons can still be classified as destructive devices themselves, such as explosive shells. While an &#x27;antique firearm&#x27; is not considered a &#x27;firearm&#x27; under the NFA, some states (such as Oregon) have laws that specifically prohibit anyone that could not otherwise own/obtain an GCA or NFA defined &#x27;firearm&#x27; (i.e., felons, recipients of dishonorable discharge from military service, the mentally adjudicated, etc.) from owning/obtaining an &#x27;antique firearm&#x27;.

Individuals or companies seeking to market large-bore firearms may apply to ATF for a &quot;sporting clause exception&quot;. If granted, ATF acknowledges that the firearm has a legitimate sporting use and is therefore not a destructive device. Certain large safari rifle calibers, such as .585 Nyati and .577 Tyrannosaur, have such exceptions.

The phrase &quot;all NFA rules apply&quot; is commonplace. This disclaimer is usually posted in bold print from firearm dealers holding an FFL license.

== Registration, purchases, taxes and transfers ==

It is a common misconception that an individual must have a &quot;Class 3&quot; license in order to own an NFA weapon. A federal firearms license (FFL) is not required to be an individual owner, although it is required as a prerequisite to become a Special Occupation Taxpayer (SOT, see Special Occupational Taxpayers): Class 1 importer, Class 2 manufacturer-dealer or Class 3 dealer in NFA weapons. There are generally three ways to own an NFA weapon: as an individual, through a gun trust, or as a Limited Liability Company (LLC). Legal possession of an NFA firearm by an individual requires transfer of registration within the NFA registry. An individual owner does not need to be an NFA dealer to buy Title II weapons. The sale and purchase of an NFA weapon is, however, taxed and regulated, as follows:

All NFA items must be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Private owners wishing to purchase an NFA item must obtain approval from the ATF, pass an extensive background check to include submitting a photograph and fingerprints, fully register the firearm, receive ATF written permission before moving the firearm across state lines, and pay a tax. The request to transfer ownership of an NFA item is made on an ATF Form 4. There have been several unfavorable lawsuits where plaintiffs have been denied NFA approval for a transfer. These lawsuits include: &quot;Lomont v. O&#x27;Neill&quot;, &quot;Westfall v. Miller&quot;, and &quot;Steele v. National Branch&quot;.

NFA items may also be transferred to corporations (or other legal entities such as a trust). When the paperwork to request transfer of an NFA item is initiated by an officer of a corporation, fingerprint cards and photographs of the official need to be submitted with the transfer request. This method has downsides, since it is the corporation (and not the principal) that owns the firearm. Thus, if the corporation dissolves, it must transfer its NFA weapon to the owners. This event would be considered a new transfer and would be subject to a new transfer tax.

The tax for privately manufacturing any NFA firearm (other than machine guns, which are illegal for individuals to manufacture) is $200. Transferring requires a $200 tax for all NFA weapons except AOWs, for which the transfer tax is $5 (although the manufacturing tax remains $200).

All NFA weapons made by individuals must be legal in the State or municipality where the individual lives. The payment of a $200 &quot;making tax&quot; prior to manufacture of the weapon, although a subsequent transfer of AOWs after they are legally &quot;made&quot; is only $5. Only a Class-II manufacturer (a FFL holder licensed as a &quot;Manufacture of Firearms&quot; or Type-07 license that has paid a Special Occupational Tax Stamp or SOT) can manufacture NFA firearms (other than destructive devices) tax free, but they pay a larger annual tax which ranges from $500 to $1000 to cover manufacturing.

A Destructive Device manufacturing license (Type-10 FFL) holder can manufacture destructive devices tax-free. However, a type-07 license costs $150 for three years –– whereas a Type-10 destructive manufacturing license costs $3000 for three years. Both licenses still require the payment of the $500 (reduced-rate) Special Occupational Tax Stamp or SOT, (or the $1000 full tax) per year to conduct manufacturing of NFA weapons that they are respectively qualified to manufacturer. The SOT &quot;reduced rate&quot; applies to a business whose sales are less than $500,000 per year.

Transferable machine guns made or registered before May 19, 1986, are worth far more than their original, pre-1986 value and items like registered &quot;auto-sears&quot;, &quot;lightning-links&quot;, trigger-packs, trunnions, and other &quot;combination of parts&quot; registered as machine guns before the aforementioned date are often worth nearly as much as a full registered machine gun. For instance, as of September 2008, a transferable M16 rifle costs approximately $11,000 to $18,000, while a transferable &quot;lightning-link&quot; for the AR-15 can sell for $8,000 to $10,000. New manufacture M-16s sell to law enforcement and the military for around $600 to $1000.

Upon the request of any ATF agent or investigator, or the Attorney General, the registered owner must provide proof of registration of the firearm.

In a number of situations, an NFA item may be transferred without a transfer tax. These include sales to government agencies, temporary transfers of an NFA firearm to a gunsmith for repairs, and transfer of an NFA firearm to a lawful heir after the death of its owner. A permanent transfer, even if tax-free, must be approved by ATF. The proper form should be submitted to ATF before the transfer occurs. For example, lawful heirs must submit a Form 5 and wait for approval before taking possession of any NFA item willed to them. Temporary transfers, such as those to a gunsmith or to the original manufacturer for repair, are not subject to ATF approval since they are not legally considered transfers. ATF does, however, recommend filing tax-free transfer paperwork on all such temporary transfers, to confer an extra layer of legal protection on both the owner and the gunsmith.

==Criminal conduct==

The Act makes certain conduct a criminal offense, in relation to engaging in business as a manufacturer, importer, or dealer with respect to (NFA) firearms without having registered or paid a Special Occupational Tax (SOT); receiving or possessing a firearm transferred to oneself in violation of the NFA; receiving or possessing a firearm made in violation of the NFA; receiving or possessing a firearm not registered to oneself in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record; transferring or making a firearm in violation of the NFA; or obliterating, removing, changing, or altering the serial number of the firearm.

==Criminal penalties==

Violations of the Act are punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison and forfeiture of all devices or firearms in violation, and the individual&#x27;s right to own or possess firearms in the future. The Act provides for a penalty of $10,000 for certain violations. A willful attempt to evade or defeat a tax imposed by the Act is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $100,000 fine ($500,000 in the case of a corporation or trust), under the general tax evasion statute. For an individual, the felony fine of $100,000 for tax evasion could be increased to $250,000.

==Exceptions==

The United States Supreme Court has ruled in &quot;Haynes v. United States&quot; that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution exempts felons—and, by extrapolation, all other prohibited possessors—from the registration requirements of the Act. The prohibited person who violates the possession prohibition can, however, be convicted under the Gun Control Act of 1968 for being a prohibited person in possession of a (any) firearm.

The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was amended in 2005 and includes a provision (42 U.S.C. § 2201a) to allow Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees and authorized contractors to possess machine guns for the purpose of providing security.

== The market for NFA items ==

Importation of NFA firearms was banned by the 1968 Gun Control Act which implemented a &quot;sporting&quot; clause. Only firearms judged by ATF to have feasible sporting applications can be imported for civilian use. Licensed manufacturers of NFA firearms may still, with the proper paperwork, import foreign NFA firearms for research and development purposes, or for government use.

The domestic manufacture of new machine guns that civilians could purchase was effectively banned by language in the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (also known as &quot;McClure-Volkmer&quot;). The language was added in an amendment from William J. Hughes and referred to as the Hughes Amendment. Machine guns legally registered prior to the date of enactment (i.e. May 1986) are still legal for possession by and transfer among civilians where permitted by state law. The static and relatively small number of transferable machine guns has caused their price to rise, often over $10,000, although transferable MAC-10 and MAC-11 submachine guns can still be purchased for around $8,000. Machine guns manufactured after the FOPA&#x27;s enactment can be sold only to law enforcement and government agencies, exported, or held as inventory or &quot;dealer samples&quot; by licensed manufacturers and dealers. Machine guns made after 1986 for law enforcement but not transferable to civilian registration are usually priced only a few hundred dollars more than their semi-automatic counterparts, whereas a pre-Hughes Amendment registered machine gun that can be legally transferred commands a huge premium.

The Hughes Amendment affected only machine guns. All other NFA firearms are still legal for manufacture and registration by civilians under Form 1, and transfer of registration to civilians via Form 4 (though some states have their own laws governing which NFA firearms are legal to own there). Silencers and Short-Barreled Rifles are generally the most popular NFA firearms among civilians, followed by Short-Barreled Shotguns, Destructive Devices, and &quot;Any Other Weapons&quot;. While most NFA firearms are bought from manufacturers and transferred to civilians through a dealer, many are made by civilians themselves after they file a Form 1 and pay the $200 tax. Some types of NFA firearms can be relatively simple to make: a Short-Barreled Rifle can be made by swapping out the upper receiver for one containing a short barrel, and a Short-Barreled Shotgun can be created by using a pipe cutter to shorten the barrel length. Other NFA firearms, such as suppressors, require more technical skill.

== NFA trust ==
An NFA trust (also known as a gun trust, Title II trust, ATF trust, or Class 3 trust) is a legal trust that is used in the United States to register and own NFA firearms. Under regulations, use of a trust allows prospective purchasers of NFA items to avoid some of the federal transfer requirements that would otherwise be imposed on an individual. Like other trusts, it allows for estate planning in inheriting firearms. In 2013, ATF proposed new rules, often referred to as ATF Proposed Rule 41p, which, if adopted, would require all &quot;responsible persons&quot; of an entity being used to purchase NFA items to comply with the same procedures as individuals in obtaining NFA items. In an NFA trust, a responsible person is defined as &quot;any grantor, trustee, beneficiary, ... who possesses, directly or indirectly, the power or authority under any trust instrument, ... to receive, possess, ship, transport, deliver, transfer, or otherwise dispose of a firearm for, or on behalf of, the entity.&quot; ATF finalized the rule on January 15, 2016, to become effective 180 days later. The previous requirement for &quot;chief law enforcement officer&quot; approval was eliminated, while all responsible people for a trust must now comply with the same restrictions as individual owners.

==&quot;Miller&quot; case==

In 1938, the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas ruled the statute unconstitutional in &quot;United States v. Miller&quot;. The defendant Miller had been arrested for possession of an unregistered short double-barreled shotgun, and for &quot;unlawfully ... transporting [it] in interstate commerce from Claremore, Oklahoma to Siloam Springs, Arkansas&quot; which perfected the crime. The government&#x27;s argument was that the short barreled shotgun was not a military-type weapon and thus not a &quot;militia&quot; weapon protected by the Second Amendment, from federal infringement. The District Court agreed with Miller&#x27;s argument that the shotgun was legal under the Second Amendment.

The District Court ruling was overturned on a direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court (see &quot;United States v. Miller&quot;). No brief was filed on behalf of the defendants, and the defendants themselves did not appear before the Supreme Court. Miller himself had been murdered one month prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. No evidence that such a firearm was &quot;ordinary military equipment&quot; had been presented at the trial court (apparently because the case had been thrown out—at the defendants&#x27; request—before evidence could be presented), although two Supreme Court justices at the time had been United States Army officers during World War I and may have had personal knowledge of the use of such weapons in combat. The Supreme Court indicated it could not take judicial notice of such a contention.

The Supreme Court reversed the District Court and held that the NFA provision (criminalizing possession of certain firearms) was not in violation of the Second Amendment&#x27;s restriction and therefore was constitutional.

Subsequent rulings have been allowed to stand, indicating that short-barreled shotguns are generally recognized as ordinary military equipment if briefs are filed (e.g., see: &quot;Cases v. United States&quot;), describing use of short-barreled shotguns in specialized military units.

<text>Sonia Rolland (born 11 February 1981) is a French-Rwandan actress and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss France 2000 and represented her country at Miss Universe 2000 where she placed Top 10. She was the first African-born winner of the Miss France pageant.

Born in Kigali, Rwanda, to a Rwandan mother and a French father, Rolland and her family fled the country due to safety concerns with the Rwandan genocide instigating, especially since her mother is Tutsi. In 1990 they moved to the neighboring country of Burundi. With the growing unrest that led to the Burundi Civil War, they moved to France in 1994. At the age of 13, Rolland settled with her family in Burgundy in the small town of Cluny.

In October 1999, Sonia Rolland won the &quot;Miss Burgundy&quot; beauty contest that allowed her to compete for the Miss France 2000 title and at the age of 18 she was the first woman of African descent to win. At the Miss Universe 2000 pageant, which took place in Cyprus, Rolland was a top 10 semi-finalist, placing 9th overall.

Rolland once lived in Paris with Christophe Rocancourt, an impostor, confidence man and gentleman thief who scammed affluent people by masquerading as a French member of the Rockefeller family. They had a daughter together, named Tess. They announced their split on 10 April 2008. Rolland has another daughter, Kahina, with actor and director Jalil Lespert, who is her partner since 2009.

At twenty years old after serious acting lessons with renowned actor Alain Delon, Rolland embarked on a new career as an actress. Following an unsettling incident during which she was attacked in the metro she took kickboxing classes that later proved advantageous as they helped her land the role of Léa in the television series &quot;Léa Parker&quot; that ran for two seasons from 2004 to 2006.

==Literary work==

Rolland&#x27;s first book was published in 2007 titled &quot;Les gazelles n&#x27;ont pas peur du noir&quot; which in English translates to &quot;Gazelles are not afraid of the dark&quot;. The book is her testimony to her childhood in Rwanda, transition to a different culture, her modeling and acting career, her philanthropic work and her family. Her next book was &quot;Beauté Black&quot; which was collaboration with Sandrine Jeanne-Rose, an expert in ethnic and black cosmetics and hair care. This collection of practical guidelines is mainly meant to reach women of African descent. The two beauty enthusiasts focus on three areas: the face, the body and most importantly the hair essentially afro-textured hair as it is an important subject in the black community.

== Philanthropy ==

Rolland&#x27;s work is mostly concentrated in Rwanda where she focuses a lot on education, as it is one of the things children survivors of the Genocide have missed out on.
She is currently collecting funds that will go towards building a school. With her new documentary &quot;Rwanda Mon Amour&quot; (&quot;Rwanda My Love&quot;) in the works the former Miss France is hoping to inspire other African nations to follow the example of Rwanda by encourage the people to participate in the ongoing changes but at the same time Rolland promises to be impartial and objective about the achievements of the country over the last 20 years. The documentary is expected to make an appearance at the Cannes film festival.

<doc id="285227" wikidata="Q7909549" url="?curid=285227" title="Vale of Leven">
<text>The Vale of Leven () is an area of West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, in the valley of the River Leven. Historically, it was part of The Lennox, the name of which derives from the Gaelic term &quot;Leamhnach&quot;, meaning &quot;field of the Leven&quot;. &quot;Leamnha&quot; is thought to mean elm-water.

Geographically the valley of the Vale of Leven runs from Loch Lomond in the north to Dumbarton in the south. However, the term &quot;Vale of Leven&quot; or just &quot;The Vale&quot; is commonly used locally to refer to the urban area towards the north of the valley that consists of a number of communities. These were historically separate villages but have expanded into one conurbation. The largest of these communities is the town of Alexandria, which sits on the west bank of the Leven. Alexandria is connected to the village of Renton to the south and to the village of Balloch in the north. Across the river from Alexandria Is Bonhill which is connected to Jamestown to the north. The combined population of these areas in 2020 was approximately 22000.

The area&#x27;s name lends itself to Alexandria&#x27;s local football club, Vale of Leven F.C.; the secondary school, Vale of Leven Academy; the Vale of Leven District General Hospital and other local organisations.

==Geography==
The Vale of Leven is the valley of the River Leven between Loch Lomond in the north and the River Clyde at Dumbarton in the south. To the east are the Kilpatrick Hills. The western hills form a minor off-shoot of the Scottish Highlands, comprising Ben Bouie, Mount Mallow and Carman muir. The valley was shaped by glacial action associated with the last glacial period in Britain, the Loch Lomond Readvance.

== History ==
Carman Hill is a large hillfort sitting west of Renton. Despite its impressive size, a lack of detailed archaeological investigations make the timing of its inhabitation and many other basic details uncertain, but its close geographical proximity to the major fortress of Alcluith at Dumbarton Rock (sited where the River Leven meets the River Clyde) suggests a relationship with this important iron age centre. After incorporation of Alcluith&#x27;s successor state, Strathclyde, into the kingdom of Scotland, the Vale of Leven became the political centre of the Earldom of Lennox. By the 13th century nearby Dumbarton was centrally controlled by the crown as a royal burgh, however the Vale of Leven remained a relatively wild area. As an example, in 1230 when the Earl of Lennox granted valuable fishing rights on the River Leven to local monks, he had to promise them protection to enable them to work there. After the Wars of Independence, Robert the Bruce purchased land in Cardross and the Vale of Leven. He lived and ruled from there until his death in 1329. There is a small King Robert the Bruce Heritage Centre situated at the train station in Renton.

The Vale of Leven was an area of small farms and relatively low population until industrialisation started with the establishment of a bleach-field at Dalquhurn, Renton in 1715. Both dyeing and bleaching industries were attracted to the area by the reliable and fast flowing waters of the River Leven. By the 1830&#x27;s dye works had spread along the river from Renton to Balloch. Individual works included those at Dalquhurn, Cordale, Bonhill, Alexandria, Milton, Dalmonach, Dillichip, Ferryfield and Levenbank. People emigrated from the Highlands, from Ireland and from northern England to staff this industry, and the five villages of The Vale grew. In 1897 several of these works amalgamated as the United Turkey Red Company. The last dyeworks in the area was the British Silk Factory which closed in 1980. Current notable employers include Loch Lomond Distilleries, Chivas Brothers distillers, and Aggreko Generators. The tourism and hospitality industries are also important local employers. 

==Politics==
The area is traditionally industrial, based particularly on the dyeing industry, but with the decline of manufacturing in Scotland has had to look to new areas for employment. The area had exceptionally high levels of unemployment in the 1920s and 1930s, which gave it a radical reputation, with Communism and Socialism being popular political philosophies in particular. During that time it was known as one of the &quot;Little Moscows&quot; in Britain i.e. an area where the Communist Party of Great Britain had exceptional strength. The Vale of Leven District Council (which disappeared in the local government reorganisation of the 1970s) could have had the distinction of being the only local council in Great Britain where the Communist Party were ever the largest single party, although unlike most of the &quot;little Moscows&quot; it was not a coal mining area. The Communist Party went into serious decline locally in the 1950s under the influence of the Cold War, more quickly than in some other &quot;little Moscows&quot;. However, there was an important industrial struggle during the early 1970s when the Plessey factory experienced a lengthy sit-in, objecting to its proposed closure.

In recent years the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party have been the dominant parties in the area, though Jim Bollan of the West Dunbartonshire Community Party and formerly the Scottish Socialist Party has been a councillor for the Leven ward of West Dunbartonshire council since 2007.

== Sport ==
The Vale of Leven was a hotspot for the early development of Scottish football. This relatively small area gave birth to numerous football clubs, of which the most successful were Vale of Leven FC and Renton FC. Neither is currently a senior team, but by 1888 the 2 clubs had won 5 Scottish Cup finals between them. As well as football teams, The Vale currently is home to the Vale of Leven Golf Club, the Vale of Leven Cricket Club, the Loch Lomond Rugby Club, a swimming pool, several bowling clubs, and the Vale of Leven &amp; District Angling Club. The latter reflects the River Leven&#x27;s historic recognition as a salmon and trout river.

== Walking and cycling ==
Two major walking and/or cycling routes cross the Vale of Leven. National Cycling Network route 7 (Glasgow to Balloch) runs along the length of the River Leven and the John Muir Way crosses the northern end of the valley. There are also many local hill walking routes leading to Cardross, Helensburgh and Glen Fruin to the west and into the Kilpatrick hills to the east.

== Transport ==
Train links to Glasgow with railway stations at Balloch, Alexandria and Renton. Bus links to Glasgow via Dumbarton and Clydebank. Also bus routes to Drymen, Helensburgh, and Luss. The A82 trunk road from Glasgow to Fort William runs through the Vale of Leven.

<text>The Crișul Repede (Romanian Crișul Repede (&quot;the rapid Criș&quot;); Hungarian Sebes-Körös) is a river in Bihor County, Crișana, Romania and in southeastern Hungary (Körösvidek). Together with the rivers Crișul Alb (&quot;the white Criș&quot;) and Crișul Negru (&quot;the black Criș&quot;), it makes up the Three Criș rivers (&quot;Cele Trei Crișuri&quot;). These are considered the main rivers in the Crișana region of Romania. Historically, when Crișana was recognised as an official region (today, Romania is divided into 40 counties), the Criș rivers were the most important in the region.

<doc id="285234" wikidata="Q3367083" url="?curid=285234" title="Beautiful Dreamer">
<text>&quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; is a parlor song by American songwriter Stephen Foster. It was published posthumously in March 1864, by Wm. A. Pond &amp; Co. of New York. The first edition states on its title page that it is &quot;the last song ever written by Stephen C. Foster, composed but a few days prior to his death.&quot; However, Carol Kimball, the author of &quot;Song&quot;, points out that the first edition&#x27;s copyright is dated 1862, which suggests, she writes, that the song was composed and readied for publication two years before Foster&#x27;s death. There are at least 20 songs, she observes, that claim to be Foster&#x27;s last, and it is unknown which is indeed his last. The song is set in time with a broken chord accompaniment.

The song tells of a lover serenading a &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; who is oblivious to worldly cares and may actually be dead. Foster&#x27;s works feature many dead young women, including his sister Charlotte and &quot;Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair&quot;. Helen Lightner writes, &quot;This sentimental ballad is folk-like in character with its repetitious but lovely melody and its basic harmonic accompaniment ... The quiet and calm of this mood is portrayed by the monotony of the arpeggiated accompaniment, by the repetitiveness of the melodic pattern, and by the strophic form itself.&quot;

==Lyrics==
==Recordings, film, and literature==
===Recordings===

The song has been recorded by Bing Crosby with John Scott Trotter &amp; his Orchestra (March 22, 1940); The Nutmegs; Steve Conway with Jack Byfield &amp; His Orchestra; Thomas Hampson with Jay Ungar (mandolin), David Alpher (piano), and Molly Mason (guitar); John Leyton (with revised lyrics by Ken Lewis and John Carter); Jerry Lee Lewis; Slim Whitman; and Roy Orbison on the album &quot;In Dreams&quot; (a top ten Australian single in 1964).

According to the 1991 DVD, &#x27;Gentleman Jim Reeves - The Story of a Legend&#x27;, the US singer recorded the song while on tour in South Africa in 1962, sung in Afrikaans under the title &quot;Bolandse Nooientjie&quot;. (A brief translation is fraught; &quot;lass of the hinterland&quot; is one possibility.) Although Reeves could not speak Afrikaans, this was remedied by South African composer and songwriter Gilbert Gibson, who stood behind Reeves and whispered the words of the song to him, who would then sing the same words into the microphone. The song appeared on the 33 rpm LP &#x27;The Jim Reeves Way&#x27; a 1965 UK &#x27;red spot&#x27; label 12-track &#x27;Dynagroove&#x27; Mono LP, co-produced by Chet Atkins &amp; including two tracks sung in Afrikaans; one of which was Bolandse Nooientjie.

Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller wrote a doo-wop version for Tony Orlando which took considerable liberties with the original; the opening quatrain, for instance is &quot;Beautiful Dreamer/Wake unto me/Can&#x27;t you see me, baby/I&#x27;m on my bended knee.&quot; Orlando released this version as a single in 1962 and it quickly became a regular part of the Beatles&#x27; set list, from 1962 through the Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour in early 1963. A recording of a 1963 Beatles performance of the song on the BBC was released in 2013 on their album &quot;On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2&quot;. Rory Storm and The Hurricanes also featured the song in their live performances. This version has been recorded by Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas.

Udo Jürgens recorded a German language version as &quot;Beautiful Dreamgirl&quot; in 1964. Wolfgang Roloff aka &quot;Ronny&quot; (1930-2011) another one in 1975: &quot;Träumendes Mädchen&quot; (&quot;Dreaming Girl&quot;).

Bobby Darin recorded a bluesy version of the song with all-new lyrics, but the song was unreleased until 1999 (on the album &quot;Bobby Darin: The Unreleased Capitol Sides&quot;). No attribution is given for the new lyrics; one possibility is that Darin might have written these himself. These lyrics tell about a lonely woman who dreams of a love of her own, and a lonely man who dreams of love too. The reference to a queen is retained in Darin&#x27;s version, asking if the woman is a &quot;queen without a throne&quot;.

The song is also featured on Marty Robbins&#x27; posthumous album &quot;Long, Long Ago&quot; (1984) and on Ray Price&#x27;s posthumous farewell album &quot;Beauty Is... Ray Price, the Final Sessions&quot; (2014).

The documentary &quot;Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of Smile&quot; is named after the song, and in the documentary Brian Wilson quips that the first letters of the words &quot;Beautiful Dreamer, Wake&quot; compare with his own initials, Brian Douglas Wilson.

===Film===
Bette Davis hums the song in her Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance of 1938, &quot;Jezebel&quot;.

The song is central to the plot of the 1949 film &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;, as it is used throughout the film to calm the title character, a large gorilla.

The tune is a motif in the 1947 film &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, where Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo) plays it at key points.

In the 1952 biopic of Stephen Foster entitled &quot;I Dream of Jeanie&quot;, there is a scene where Stephen Foster, played by Bill Shirley, sings this song as a serenade to one of his two love interests in the film.

The song is touched on repeatedly relating to the subliminal stimuli throughout the 2018 film &quot;Distorted&quot;.
The song is used as a recurring theme in &quot;Winchester&quot; (2018) with Helen Mirren.

The song is used as a theme song in the 2020 Netflix movie &quot;Lost Girls&quot;.

In &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), the song is referenced, when the ghoulish Igor (Marty Feldman), hears a shrill and anguished female wail from a remote dungeon, he smiles and (almost) sings &quot;Beautiful screamer...&quot;.

In &quot;Lorelei&quot; (2021), the song is featured in several scenes and gives the film its title.

A cover version of the song with lyrics written by Rafael Jaime and titled &quot;Brave Angel&quot; is prominently featured in the final scene of the 2024 live-action Mexican independent short film &quot;Mi Hermano Lobo (My Brother Wolf)&quot;. It is used as a hopeful and uplifting lullaby and performed by Mowgli (Héctor Mateo García Díaz Infante) to comfort his young protégé Rafael (Jorge Luis Jiménez Avilés).

===Literature===
The song is pivotal to E. B. White&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;The Trumpet of the Swan&quot;. Louis the trumpeter swan learns the tune during his long journey to find his voice via a stolen trumpet and a chalk slate. In a climactic scene, he belts out its poetry on his trumpet at dawn, declaring his love in the Philadelphia Zoo to the beautiful swan Serena, the object of his long unrequited love. White also includes the public domain sheet music in the novel, perhaps to encourage similarly dramatic loving gestures. The song was also used in &quot;The Diviners&quot; book 2, &quot;Lair of Dreams&quot; by Libba Bray.

<doc id="285235" wikidata="Q466481" url="?curid=285235" title="Dacite">
<text>Dacite () is a volcanic rock formed by rapid solidification of lava that is high in silica and low in alkali metal oxides. It has a fine-grained (aphanitic) to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. It is composed predominantly of plagioclase feldspar and quartz.

Dacite is relatively common, occurring in many tectonic settings. It is associated with andesite and rhyolite as part of the subalkaline tholeiitic and calc-alkaline magma series.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dacite&quot; comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.

The term &quot;dacite&quot; was used for the first time in the scientific literature in the book &quot;Geologie Siebenbürgens&quot; (&quot;The Geology of Transylvania&quot;) by Austrian geologists Franz Ritter von Hauer and Guido Stache. Dacite was originally defined as a new rock type to separate calc-alkaline rocks with oligoclase phenocrysts (dacites) from rocks with orthoclase phenocrysts (rhyolites).

==Composition==
Dacite consists mostly of plagioclase feldspar and quartz with biotite, hornblende, and pyroxene (augite or enstatite). The quartz appears as rounded, corroded phenocrysts, or as an element of the ground-mass. The plagioclase in dacite ranges from oligoclase to andesine and labradorite. Sanidine occurs, although in small proportions, in some dacites, and when abundant gives rise to rocks that form transitions to the rhyolites.

The relative proportions of feldspars and quartz in dacite, and in many other volcanic rocks, are illustrated in the QAPF diagram. This defines dacite as having a content of 20% to 60% quartz, with plagioclase making up 65% or more of its feldspar content. However, while the IUGS recommends classifying volcanic rocks on the basis of their mineral composition whenever possible, dacites are often so fine-grained that mineral identification is impractical. The rock must then be classified chemically based on its content of silica and alkali metal oxides (K2O plus Na2O). The TAS classification puts dacite in the O3 sector.

==Texture==

In hand specimen, many of the hornblende and biotite dacites are grey or pale brown and yellow rocks with white feldspars, and black crystals of biotite and hornblende. Other dacites, especially pyroxene-bearing dacites, are darker colored.

In thin section, dacites may have an aphanitic to porphyritic texture. Porphyritic dacites contain blocky highly zoned plagioclase phenocrysts and/or rounded corroded quartz phenocrysts. Subhedral hornblende and elongated biotite grains are present. Sanidine phenocrysts and augite (or enstatite) are found in some samples. The groundmass of these rocks is often aphanitic microcrystalline, with a web of minute feldspars mixed with interstitial grains of quartz or tridymite; but in many dacites it is largely vitreous, while in others it is felsitic or cryptocrystalline.

==Geological context and formation==

Dacite usually forms as an intrusive rock such as a dike or sill. Examples of this type of dacite outcrop are found in northwestern Montana and northeastern Bulgaria. Nevertheless, because of the moderately high silica content, dacitic magma is quite viscous and therefore prone to explosive eruption. A notorious example of this is Mount St. Helens in which dacite domes formed from previous eruptions. Pyroclastic flows may also be of dacitic composition as is the case with the Fish Canyon Tuff of La Garita Caldera.

Dacitic magma is formed by the subduction of young oceanic crust under a thick felsic continental plate. Oceanic crust is hydrothermally altered causing addition of quartz and sodium. As the young, hot oceanic plate is subducted under continental crust, the subducted slab partially melts and interacts with the upper mantle through convection and dehydration reactions. The process of subduction creates metamorphism in the subducting slab. When this slab reaches the mantle and initiates the dehydration reactions, minerals such as talc, serpentine, mica and amphiboles break down generating a more sodic melt. The magma then continues to migrate upwards causing differentiation and becomes even more sodic and silicic as it rises. Once at the cold surface, the sodium rich magma crystallizes plagioclase, quartz and hornblende. Accessory minerals like pyroxenes provide insight to the history of the magma.

The formation of dacite provides a great deal of information about the connection between oceanic crust and continental crust. It provides a model for the generation of felsic, buoyant, perennial rock from a mafic, dense, short-lived one.

===Dacite&#x27;s role in the formation of Archean continental crust===
The process by which dacite forms has been used to explain the generation of continental crust during the Archean eon. At that time, the production of dacitic magma was more ubiquitous, due to the availability of young, hot oceanic crust. Today, the colder oceanic crust that subducts under most plates is not able to melt prior to the dehydration reactions, thus inhibiting the process.

===Molten dacite magma at Kīlauea===
Dacitic magma was encountered in a drillhole during geothermal exploration on Kīlauea in 2005. At a depth of 2488 m, the magma flowed up the wellbore. This produced several kilograms of clear, colorless vitric (glassy, non-crystalline) cuttings at the surface. The dacite magma is a residual melt of the typical basalt magma of Kīlauea.

== Distribution ==

Dacite is relatively common and occurs in various tectonic and magmatic contexts:
* In oceanic volcanic series. Examples: Iceland (Heiðarsporður ridge), Juan de Fuca Ridge.
* In calc-alkaline and tholeiitic volcanic series of the subduction zones of island arcs and active continental margins. Examples of dacitic magmatism in island arcs are Japan, the Philippines, the Aleutians, the Antilles, the Sunda Arc (Mount Batur), Tonga and the South Sandwich Islands. Examples of dacitic magmatism in active continental margins are the Cascade Range, Guatemala and the Andes (Ecuador, Peru and Chile).
* In continental volcanic series, often in association with tholeiitic basalts and intermediary rocks

The type locality of dacite is Gizella quarry near Poieni, Cluj in Romania. Other occurrences of dacite in Europe are Germany (Weiselberg), Greece (Nisyros and Thera), Italy (in Bozen quartz porphyry, and Sardinia), Austria (Styrian Volcano Arc), Scotland (Argyll), Slovakia, Spain (El Hoyazo near Almería), France (Massif de l&#x27;Esterel) and Hungary (Csódi Hill).

Sites outside Europe include Iran, Morocco, New Zealand (volcanic region of Taupo), Turkey, USA and Zambia.

Dacite is found extraterrestrially at Nili Patera caldera of Syrtis Major Planum on Mars.

<doc id="285236" wikidata="Q332748" url="?curid=285236" title="Trachyte">
<text>Trachyte () is an extrusive igneous rock composed mostly of alkali feldspar. It is usually light-colored and aphanitic (fine-grained), with minor amounts of mafic minerals, and is formed by the rapid cooling of lava (or shallow intrusions) enriched with silica and alkali metals. It is the volcanic equivalent of syenite.

Trachyte is common wherever alkali magma is erupted, including in late stages of ocean island volcanism and in continental rift valleys, above mantle plumes, and in areas of back-arc extension. Trachyte has also been found in Gale crater on Mars.

Trachyte has been used as decorative building stone and was extensively used as dimension stone in the Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice.

==Chemical composition==

Trachyte has a silica content of 60 to 65% and an alkali oxide content of over 7%. This gives it less SiO2 than rhyolite and more (Na2O plus K2O) than dacite. These chemical differences are consistent with the position of trachyte in the TAS classification, and they account for the feldspar-rich mineralogy of the rock type. Trachydacite occupies the same field in the TAS diagram as trachyte, but is distinguished from trachyte by a normative quartz content over 20%. Trachydacite is not a recognized rock type in the QAPF classification, where rocks rich in alkali feldspar and with quartz over 20% would be classified as rhyolites.

==Mineralogy==
The mineral assemblage of trachytes consists of essential alkali feldspar. Relatively minor plagioclase and quartz or a feldspathoid such as nepheline may also be present. This is reflected in the position of the trachyte fields in the QAPF diagram. Biotite, clinopyroxene and olivine are common accessory minerals. The plagioclase is typically sodium-rich oligoclase. The alkali feldspar is typically also sodium-rich sanidine (anorthoclase) and is often cryptoperthitic, with alternating microscopic bands of sodium feldspar (albite) and potassium feldspar (sanidine).

Trachytes are typically fine-grained and light-colored, but can be black if they consist mostly of glass. They are often porphyritic, with large well-shaped crystals of sanidine in a groundmass containing much smaller imperfect sanidine laths. Rhomb porphyry is an example with usually large porphyritic rhomb shaped phenocrysts embedded in a very fine-grained matrix. Some of the best known trachytes, such as the trachyte of Drachenfels on the Rhine, show striking porphyritic character, having large sanidine crystals of tabular form an inch or two in length scattered through their fine-grained groundmass. In many trachytes, however, the phenocrysts are few and small, and the groundmass comparatively coarse. The ferromagnesian minerals rarely occur in large crystals, and are usually not conspicuous in hand-sized specimens of these rocks. Two types of groundmass are generally recognized: the trachytic, composed mainly of long, narrow, subparallel rods of sanidine, and the orthophyric, consisting of small squarish or rectangular prisms of the same mineral. Sometimes granular augite or spongy riebeckite occurs in the groundmass, but as a rule this part of the rock is highly feldspathic.

Trachytes very often have minute irregular vesicles which make the broken surfaces of specimens of these rocks rough and irregular, and it is from this distinctive texture that they received their name. It was first given to rocks of this class from Auvergne, and was long used in a much wider sense than that defined above, so that it included quartz-trachytes (now known as liparites and rhyolites) and oligoclase-trachytes, which are now classified as andesites.

Quartz is rare in trachyte, but tridymite (which likewise consists of silica) is not uncommon. It is rarely in crystals large enough to be visible without the aid of the microscope, but in thin sections it may appear as small hexagonal plates, which overlap and form dense aggregates, like a mosaic or like the tiles on a roof. They often cover the surfaces of the larger feldspars or line the vesicles of the rock, where they may be mingled with amorphous opal or fibrous chalcedony. In the older trachytes, secondary quartz from the recrystallization of tridymite is not rare.

Of the mafic minerals present, augite is the most common. It is usually of pale green color, and its small crystals are often very perfect in form. Brown hornblende and biotite occur also, and are usually surrounded by black corrosion borders composed of magnetite and pyroxene; sometimes the replacement is complete and no hornblende or biotite is left, though the outlines of the cluster of magnetite and augite may clearly indicate from which of these minerals it was derived. Olivine is unusual, though found in some trachytes, for example those of the Arso in Ischia. Basic varieties of plagioclase, such as labradorite, are known also as phenocrysts in some Italian trachytes. Dark brown varieties of augite and rhombic pyroxene (hypersthene or bronzite) have been observed but are not common. Apatite, zircon and magnetite are practically always present as accessory minerals.

Occasionally minerals of the feldspathoid group, such as nepheline, sodalite and leucite, are present in trachytes, and rocks of this kind are known as foid-bearing trachytes. The sodium-bearing amphiboles and pyroxenes so characteristic of the phonolites may also be found in some trachytes; thus aegirine or aegirine augite forms outgrowths on diopside crystals, and riebeckite may be present in spongy growths among the feldspars of the groundmass (as in the trachyte of Berkum on the Rhine). Glassy forms of trachyte (obsidian) occur, as in Iceland, and pumiceous varieties are known (in Tenerife and elsewhere), but these rocks as contrasted with the rhyolites have a remarkably strong tendency to crystallize, and are rarely to any considerable extent vitreous.

==Geographic distribution==
Trachyte is the usual silica-rich end member of the alkaline magma series, in which alkaline basaltic magma experiences fractional crystallization while still underground. This process removes calcium, magnesium, and iron from the magma to give it a composition close to that of alkali feldspar. As a result, trachyte is common wherever alkali magma is erupted, including late eruptions of ocean islands and in continental rift valleys and mantle plumes. Only rarely does magmatic differentiation proceed beyond trachyte to phonolite or even more evolved alkaline magmas. Trachyte also occurs in areas of back-arc extension, such as the northern Aegean Sea and the Aeolian arc of Italy. The Aeolian back-arc includes the Campi Flegrei volcanic field, where trachytes have been erupted.

Trachytes are well represented among the Cenozoic volcanic rocks of Europe. In Britain they occur in Skye as lava flows and as dikes or intrusions, but they are much more common on the continent of Europe, as in the Rhine district and the Eifel, also in Auvergne, Bohemia and the Euganean Hills. In the neighborhood of Rome, Naples and the island of Ischia trachytic lavas and tuffs are of common occurrence. Trachytes are also found on the island of Pantelleria. In the United States, trachytes crop out extensively in the Davis Mountains, Chisos Mountains, and Big Bend Ranch State Park in the Big Bend (Texas) region, as well as southern Nevada and South Dakota (Black Hills). There is one known voluminous flow from Puʻu Waʻawaʻa on the north flank of Hualālai in Hawaiʻi. Here the trachyte is glassy and black in color. In Iceland, the Azores, Tenerife and Ascension there are recent trachytic lavas, and rocks of this kind occur also in New South Wales (Cambewarra Range), Queensland (Main Range), East Africa, Madagascar, Yemen and in many other districts.

Among the older volcanic rocks trachytes also are not scarce, though they have often been described under the names orthophyre and orthoclase-porphyry, while trachyte was reserved for Tertiary and recent rocks of similar composition. In England there are Permian trachytes in the Exeter district, and Carboniferous trachytes are found in many parts of the central valley of Scotland. The latter differ in no essential respect from their modern representatives in Italy and the Rhine valley, but their augite and biotite are often replaced by chlorite and other secondary products. Permian trachytes occur also in Thuringia and the Saar district in Germany.

Alkaline rocks such as trachyte are rare in the Archean, but become common in the Proterozoic. Alkaline rocks with an age close to 570 million years are common around the perimeters of many continental shields and are evidence of worldwide rifting at that time.

Closely allied to trachyte is the rock type called keratophyre, which is the sodium-rich-plagioclase equivalent of trachyte.

<text>The trudgen is a swimming stroke sometimes known as the &quot;racing stroke&quot;, or the &quot;East Indian stroke&quot;. It is named after the English swimmer John Trudgen (1852–1902) and evolved out of sidestroke.

One swims mostly upon one side, making an overhand movement, lifting the arms alternately out of the water. When the left arm is above the head, the legs spread apart for a kick; as the left arm comes down the legs extend and are then brought together with a sharp scissor kick. The right arm is now brought forward over the water, and as it comes down the left arm is extended again. The scissor kick comes every second stroke; it involves spreading the legs, then bringing them together with a sudden &quot;snap&quot; movement.

The swimmer&#x27;s face is underwater most of the time; the only chance to breathe is when the hand is coming back and just as the elbow passes the face. The trudgen developed into the front crawl.

<text>Latite is an igneous, volcanic rock, with aphanitic-aphyric to aphyric-porphyritic texture. It is the volcanic equivalent of monzonite. Its mineral assemblage is usually alkali feldspar and plagioclase in approximately equal amounts. Quartz is less than five percent and is absent in a feldspathoid-bearing latite, and olivine is absent in a quartz-bearing latite. When quartz content is greater than five percent the rock is classified as quartz latite. Biotite, hornblende, pyroxene and scarce olivine or quartz are common accessory minerals. Feldspathoid-bearing latite is sometimes referred to as tristanite.

Rhomb porphyries are an unusual variety with gray-white porphyritic rhomb shaped phenocrysts embedded in a very fine grained red-brown matrix. The composition of rhomb porphyry places it in the trachyte - latite classification of the QAPF diagram.

Latite is found, for example, as lavas in Bulgaria and as intrusive laccoliths and sills in South Dakota, USA.

<doc id="285239" wikidata="Q181908" url="?curid=285239" title="Andesite">
<text>Andesite () is a volcanic rock of intermediate composition. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between silica-poor basalt and silica-rich rhyolite. It is fine-grained (aphanitic) to porphyritic in texture, and is composed predominantly of sodium-rich plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende.

Andesite is the extrusive equivalent of plutonic diorite. Characteristic of subduction zones, andesite represents the dominant rock type in island arcs. The average composition of the continental crust is andesitic. Along with basalts, andesites are a component of the Martian crust.

The name &quot;andesite&quot; is derived from the Andes mountain range, where this rock type is found in abundance. It was first applied by Christian Leopold von Buch in 1826.

== Description ==
Andesite is an aphanitic (fine-grained) to porphyritic (coarse-grained) igneous rock that is intermediate in its content of silica and low in alkali metals. It has less than 20% quartz and 10% feldspathoid by volume, with at least 65% of the feldspar in the rock consisting of plagioclase. This places andesite in the basalt/andesite field of the QAPF diagram. Andesite is further distinguished from basalt by its silica content of over 52%. However, it is often not possible to determine the mineral composition of volcanic rocks, due to their very fine grain size, and andesite is then defined chemically as volcanic rock with a content of 57% to 63% silica and not more than about 6% alkali metal oxides. This places the andesite in the O2 field of the TAS classification. Basaltic andesite, with a content of 52% to 57% silica, is represented by the O1 field of the TAS classification but is not a distinct rock type in the QAPF classification.

Andesite is usually light to dark grey in colour, due to its content of hornblende or pyroxene minerals. but can exhibit a wide range of shading. Darker andesite can be challenging to distinguish from basalt, but a common , used away from the laboratory, is that andesite has a color index less than 35.

The plagioclase in andesite varies widely in sodium content, from anorthite to oligoclase, but is typically andesine, in which anorthite makes up about 40 mol% of the plagioclase. The pyroxene minerals that may be present include augite, pigeonite, or orthopyroxene. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts.

Andesite is usually porphyritic, containing larger crystals (phenocrysts) of plagioclase formed prior to the extrusion that brought the magma to the surface, embedded in a finer-grained matrix. Phenocrysts of pyroxene or hornblende are also common. These minerals have the highest melting temperatures of the typical minerals that can crystallize from the melt and are therefore the first to form solid crystals. Classification of andesites may be refined according to the most abundant phenocryst. For example, if hornblende is the principal phenocryst mineral, the andesite will be described as a &quot;hornblende andesite&quot;.

== Andesitic volcanism ==
Andesite lava typically has a viscosity of 3.5 × 106 cP (3.5 × 103 Pa⋅s) at . This is slightly greater than the viscosity of smooth peanut butter. As a result, andesitic volcanism is often explosive, forming tuffs and agglomerates. Andesite vents tend to build up composite volcanoes rather than the shield volcanoes characteristic of basalt, with its much lower viscosity resulting from its lower silica content and higher eruption temperature.
Block lava flows are typical of andesitic lavas from composite volcanoes. They behave in a similar manner to ʻaʻā flows but their more viscous nature causes the surface to be covered in smooth-sided angular fragments (blocks) of solidified lava instead of clinkers. As with ʻaʻā flows, the molten interior of the flow, which is kept insulated by the solidified blocky surface, advances over the rubble that falls off the flow front. They also move much more slowly downhill and are thicker in depth than ʻaʻā flows.


== Generation of melts in island arcs ==
Though andesite is common in other tectonic settings, it is particularly characteristic of convergent plate margins. Even before the Plate Tectonics Revolution, geologists had defined an &quot;andesite line&quot; in the western Pacific that separated basalt of the central Pacific from andesite further west. This coincides with the subduction zones at the western boundary of the Pacific Plate. Magmatism in island arc regions comes from the interplay of the subducting plate and the &quot;mantle wedge&quot;, the wedge-shaped region between the subducting and overriding plates. The presence of convergent margins dominated by andesite is so characteristic of the Earth&#x27;s unique plate tectonics that the Earth has been described as an &quot;andesite planet&quot;.

During subduction, the subducted oceanic crust is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature, leading to metamorphism. Hydrous minerals such as amphibole, zeolites, or chlorite (which are present in the oceanic lithosphere) dehydrate as they change to more stable, anhydrous forms, releasing water and soluble elements into the overlying wedge of mantle. Fluxing water into the wedge lowers the solidus of the mantle material and causes partial melting. Due to the lower density of the partially molten material, it rises through the wedge until it reaches the lower boundary of the overriding plate. Melts generated in the mantle wedge are of basaltic composition, but they have a distinctive enrichment of soluble elements (e.g. potassium (K), barium (Ba), and lead (Pb)) which are contributed from sediment that lies at the top of the subducting plate. Although there is evidence to suggest that the subducting oceanic crust may also melt during this process, the relative contribution of the three components (crust, sediment, and wedge) to the generated basalts is still a matter of debate.

Basalt thus formed can contribute to the formation of andesite through fractional crystallization, partial melting of crust, or magma mixing, all of which are discussed next.

==Genesis ==
Intermediate volcanic rocks are created via several processes:

* Fractional crystallization of a mafic parent magma.
* Partial melting of crustal material.
* Magma mixing between felsic rhyolitic and mafic basaltic magmas in a magma reservoir
* Partial melting of metasomatized mantle

=== Fractional crystallization ===

To achieve andesitic composition via fractional crystallization, a basaltic magma must crystallize specific minerals that are then removed from the melt. This removal can take place in a variety of ways, but most commonly this occurs by crystal settling. The first minerals to crystallize and be removed from a basaltic parent are olivines and amphiboles. These mafic minerals settle out of the magma, forming mafic cumulates. There is geophysical evidence from several arcs that large layers of mafic cumulates lie at the base of the crust. Once these mafic minerals have been removed, the melt no longer has a basaltic composition. The silica content of the residual melt is enriched relative to the starting composition. The iron and magnesium contents are depleted. As this process continues, the melt becomes more and more evolved eventually becoming andesitic. Without continued addition of mafic material, however, the melt will eventually reach a rhyolitic composition. This produces the characteristic basalt-andesite-rhyolite association of island arcs, with andesite the most distinctive rock type.

=== Partial melting of the crust ===
Partially molten basalt in the mantle wedge moves upwards until it reaches the base of the overriding crust. Once there, the basaltic melt can either underplate the crust, creating a layer of molten material at its base, or it can move into the overriding plate in the form of dykes. If it underplates the crust, the basalt can (in theory) cause partial melting of the lower crust due to the transfer of heat and volatiles. Models of heat transfer, however, show that arc basalts emplaced at temperatures 1100–1240 °C cannot provide enough heat to melt lower crustal amphibolite. Basalt can, however, melt pelitic upper crustal material.

=== Magma mixing ===
In continental arcs, such as the Andes, magma often pools in the shallow crust creating magma chambers. Magmas in these reservoirs become evolved in composition (dacitic to rhyolitic) through both the process of fractional crystallization and partial melting of the surrounding country rock. Over time as crystallization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool. In order to remain active, magma chambers must have continued recharge of hot basaltic melt into the system. When this basaltic material mixes with the evolved rhyolitic magma, the composition is returned to andesite, its intermediate phase. Evidence of magma mixing is provided by the presence of phenocrysts in some andesites that are not in chemical equilibrium with the melt in which they are found.

=== Partial melting of metasomatized mantle ===
High-magnesium andesites (&quot;boninites&quot;) in island arcs may be primitive andesites, generated from metasomatized mantle.
 Experimental evidence shows that depleted mantle rock exposed to alkali fluids such as might be given off by a subducting slab generates magma resembling high-magnesium andesites.

==Notable andesite structures==

Notable stonemasonry structures built with andesite include:

* Borobudur in Java, Indonesia
* Sacsayhuamán citadel in Peru
* Gate of the Sun in Bolivia
* Templo Mayor ruins and other historic buildings in Mexico City, built from andesite and Tezontle basaltic andesite

==Extraterrestrial samples==
In 2009, researchers revealed that andesite was found in two meteorites (numbered GRA 06128 and GRA 06129) that were discovered in the Graves Nunataks icefield during the US Antarctic Search for Meteorites 2006/2007 field season. This possibly points to a new mechanism to generate andesite crust.

Along with basalts, andesites are a component of the Martian crust. The presence of distinctive steep-sided domes on Venus suggests that andesite may have been erupted from large magma chambers where crystal settling could take place.

<doc id="285241" wikidata="Q1257550" url="?curid=285241" title="Phonolite">
<text>Phonolite is an uncommon shallow intrusive or extrusive rock, of intermediate chemical composition between felsic and mafic, with texture ranging from aphanitic (fine-grained) to porphyritic (mixed fine- and coarse-grained). Phonolite is a variation of the igneous rock trachyte that contains nepheline or leucite rather than quartz. It has an unusually high (12% or more) Na2O + K2O content, defining its position in the TAS classification of igneous rocks. Its coarse grained (phaneritic) intrusive equivalent is nepheline syenite. Phonolite is typically fine grained and compact.
The name &quot;phonolite&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;sounding stone&quot; due to the metallic sound it produces if an unfractured plate is hit; hence, the English name &quot;clinkstone&quot; is given as a synonym.

== Formation ==
Unusually, phonolite forms from magma with a relatively low silica content, generated by low degrees of partial melting (less than 10%) of highly aluminous rocks of the lower crust such as tonalite, monzonite and metamorphic rocks. Melting of such rocks to a very low degree promotes the liberation of aluminium, potassium, sodium and calcium by melting of feldspar, with some involvement of mafic minerals. Because the rock is silica-undersaturated, it has no quartz or other silica crystals, and is dominated by low-silica feldspathoid minerals more than feldspar minerals.

A few geological processes and tectonic events can melt the necessary precursor rocks to form phonolite. These include intracontinental hotspot volcanism, such as may form above mantle plumes covered by thick continental crust. A-type granites and alkaline igneous provinces usually occur alongside phonolites. Low-degree partial melting of underplates of granitic material in collisional orogenic belts may also produce phonolites.

== Mineralogy and petrology ==

Phonolite is a fine-grained equivalent of nepheline syenite. They are products of partial melting, are silica-undersaturated, and have feldspathoids in their normative mineralogy.

Mineral assemblages in phonolite occurrences are usually abundant feldspathoids (nepheline, sodalite, hauyne, leucite and analcite) and alkali feldspar (sanidine, anorthoclase or orthoclase), and rare sodic plagioclase. Biotite, sodium-rich amphiboles and pyroxenes along with iron-rich olivine are common minor minerals. Accessory phases include titanite, apatite, corundum, zircon, magnetite and ilmenite. Phonolite&#x27;s characteristic dark color comes from its concentration of dark pyroxenes such as aegirine and augite.

Blairmorite is an analcite-rich variety of phonolite.

== Occurrence ==

Nepheline syenites and phonolites occur widely distributed throughout the world in Canada, Norway, Greenland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Ural Mountains, the Pyrenees, Italy, Eifel and Kaiserstuhl in Germany, Brazil, the Transvaal region, the Magnet Cove igneous complex of Arkansas, the Beemerville Complex of New Jersey, as well as on oceanic islands such as the Canary Islands.

Phonolite is common across Europe, particularly within the Eifel Plateau and the Laacher See. It is also found in the Czech Republic and the Mediterranean area near Italy. For localities in the United States, phonolite can be found in the Black Hills Forest in South Dakokta. The most well known phonolite-composed natural structure is the Devil&#x27;s Tower, found in Wyoming.

Nepheline-normative rocks occur in close association with the Bushveld Igneous Complex, possibly formed from partial melting of the wall rocks adjacent to that large ultramafic layered intrusion. Phonolite occurs in the related Pilanesberg Complex and Pienaars River Complex.

====North America====

* Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mine phonolite pipe in Colorado
* Baldface Mountain, west-central British Columbia, Canada
* Devils Tower, Wyoming, United States, an example of columnar-jointed phonolite
* Hoodoo Mountain, northwestern British Columbia, Canada
* Missouri Buttes, Crook County, northeast Wyoming, United States

====Europe====
* Bass Rock, North Berwick Law and Traprain Law in southeast Scotland, UK
* Bořeň, northwestern Czech Republic
* Mont Gerbier de Jonc, Ardèche, France 
* Montiferru, Sardinia
* Wolf Rock, Cornwall

====Other====

* Mount Cargill, Dunedin, New Zealand
* Teide, a stratovolcano on the island of Tenerife
* The phonolitic lava lake in Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica
* The &#x27;Bellstone&#x27; in Saint Helena

== Economic importance ==
Phonolites can be of interest as dimension stone or as aggregate for gravels.

Rarely, economically mineralised phonolite-nepheline syenite alkaline complexes can be associated with rare-earth mineralisation, uranium mineralisation and phosphates, such as at Phalaborwa, South Africa.

Phonolite tuff was used as a source of flint for adze heads and such by prehistoric people from Hohentwiel and Hegau, Germany.

Phonolites can be separated into slabs of appropriate dimensions to be used as roofing tiles in place of roofing slate. One such occurrence is in the French Massif Central region such as the Haute Loire département.

<doc id="285242" wikidata="Q266882" url="?curid=285242" title="Cray X-MP">
<text>The Cray X-MP was a supercomputer designed, built and sold by Cray Research. It was announced in 1982 as the &quot;cleaned up&quot; successor to the 1975 Cray-1, and was the world&#x27;s fastest computer from 1983 to 1985 with a quad-processor system performance of 800 MFLOPS. The principal designer was Steve Chen.

==Description==
The X-MP&#x27;s main improvement over the Cray-1 was that it was a shared-memory parallel vector processor, the first such computer from Cray Research. It housed up to four CPUs in a mainframe that was nearly identical in outside appearance to the Cray-1.

The X-MP CPU had a faster 9.5 nanosecond clock cycle (105 MHz), compared to 12.5 ns for the Cray-1A. It was built from bipolar gate-array integrated circuits containing 16 emitter-coupled logic gates each. The CPU was very similar to the Cray-1 CPU in architecture, but had better memory bandwidth (with two read ports and one write port to the main memory instead of only one read/write port) and improved chaining support. Each CPU had a theoretical peak performance of 200 MFLOPS.

The X-MP initially supported 2 million 64-bit words (16 MB) of main memory in 16 banks, respectively. The main memory was built from 4 Kbit bipolar SRAM ICs. CMOS memory versions of the Cray-1M were renamed Cray X-MP/1s. This configuration was first used for Cray Research&#x27;s UNIX port.

In 1984, improved models of the X-MP were announced, consisting of one, two, and four-processor systems with 4 and 8 million word configurations. The top-end system was the X-MP/48, which contained four CPUs with a theoretical peak system performance of over 800 MFLOPS and 8 million words of memory. The CPUs in these models introduced vector gather/scatter memory reference instructions to the product line. The amount of main memory supported was increased to a maximum of 16 million words, depending on the model. The main memory was built from bipolar or MOS SRAM ICs, depending on the model.

The system initially ran the proprietary Cray Operating System (COS) and was object-code compatible with the Cray-1. A UNIX System V derivative initially named CX-OS and finally renamed UNICOS ran through a guest operating system facility. UNICOS became the main OS from 1986 onwards. The DOE ran the Cray Time Sharing System and the NLTSS operating systems instead. See the Software section for the Cray-1 for a more detailed elaboration of software (language compiler, assembler, operating systems, and applications) as X-MPs and Cray-1s were mostly compatible.

==Extended Architecture series==
Cray Research announced the X-MP Extended Architecture series in 1986. The EA series CPU had an 8.5 ns clock cycle (117 MHz), and was built from macrocell array and gate array ICs. The EA series extended the width of the A and B registers to 32 bits and performed 32-bit address arithmetic, increasing the amount of memory theoretically addressable to 2 billion words. The largest configuration produced was 64 million words of MOS SRAM in 64 banks. For compatibility with existing software written for the Cray-1 and older X-MP models, 24-bit addressing was also supported. Each EA series CPU&#x27;s peak performance was 234 MFLOPS. For a four-processor system, the peak performance was 942 MFLOPS.

==I/O subsystem==

The Input/Output (I/O) subsystem could have two to four I/O processors with a total of 2 to 32 disk storage units. The DD-39 and DD-49 hard drives made by Ibis with a raw transfer rate of 13.3 MB/s each stored 1200 megabyte (blocked and formatted) with 5.9 MB/s and 9.8 MB/s transfer rates (unstriped), respectively. Optional solid-state drives were available with 256, 512 or 1024 MB capacities with transfer rates of 100 to 1,000 MB/s per channel. Up to 38 gigabytes of data storage was possible.

For magnetic tape I/O, the system could interface with IBM 3420 and 3480 tape units directly without a lot of CPU processing.

==Pricing==
A 1984 X-MP/48 cost about US$15 million plus the cost of disks. In 1985 Bell Labs purchased a Cray X-MP/24 for $10.5 million along with eight DD-49 1.2 GB drives for an additional $1 million. They received $1.5 million of trade-in credit for their Cray-1.

==Successors==
The Cray-2, a completely new design, was introduced in 1985. A very different compact four-processor design with from 64 MW (megaword) to 512 MW (512 MB to 4 GB) of main memory, it was specified to 500 MFLOPS but was slower than the X-MP on certain calculations due to its high memory latency.

The Cray Y-MP upgrade of the X-MP series was announced in 1988; it also had a new design, replacing the 16-gate ECL gate arrays with a more compact VLSI gate array with larger circuit boards. It was a major improvement of the X-MP supporting up to eight processors.

==Usage==
* The short film &quot;The Adventures of André &amp; Wally B.&quot;, released in 1984 by The Graphics Group, a then-Lucasfilm subsidiary which would later become Pixar, used an X-MP/48 for much of its rendering. Special thanks is given to Cray Research in the short&#x27;s credits for use of the machine.
* The 1984 film &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; depended heavily on high polygon count (for the time) models with complex lighting effects, the rendering of which was made possible by the use of the X-MP.
* The animation for the 1986 Marvel Productions logo, which featured an animated silver-colored Spider-Man, was rendered using this supercomputer.
* Mick Jagger&#x27;s single version of &quot;Hard Woman&quot; extensively utilised the X-MP for rendering its music video animation.

<text>Tephrite is an igneous, volcanic (extrusive) rock, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. Mineral content is usually abundant feldspathoids (leucite or nepheline), plagioclase, and lesser alkali feldspar. Pyroxenes (clinopyroxenes) are common accessory minerals. Quartz and olivine are absent. The absence of olivine distinguishes them from the otherwise similar basanite. It&#x27;s parameters are defined in the QAPF diagram. Occurrences include leucite nepheline tephrite from Hamberg bei Neckarelz near Heidelberg, Germany, phonolite-tephrite at Monte Vulture, Basilicata, Italy and basanite–tephrite intrusions in Namibia.

<text>Basanite () is an igneous, volcanic (extrusive) rock with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. It is composed mostly of feldspathoids, pyroxenes, olivine, and calcic plagioclase and forms from magma low in silica and enriched in alkali metal oxides that solidifies rapidly close to the Earth&#x27;s surface.

==Description==
Basanite is an aphanitic (fine-grained) igneous rock that is low in silica and enriched in alkali metals. Of its total content of quartz, feldspar, and feldspathoid (QAPF), between 10% and 60% by volume is feldspathoid and over 90% of the feldspar is plagioclase. Quartz is never present. This places basanite in the basanite/tephrite field of the QAPF diagram. Basanite is further distinguished from tephrite by having a normative olivine content greater than 10%. While the IUGS recommends classification by mineral content whenever possible, volcanic rock can be glassy or so fine-grained that this is impractical, and then the rock is classified chemically using the TAS classification. Basanite then falls into the U1 (basanite-tephrite) field of the TAS diagram. Basanite is again distinguished from tephrite by its normative olivine content and from nephelinite by a normative albite content of over 5% and a normative nepheline content under 20%.

The mineral assembly in basanite is usually abundant feldspathoids (nepheline or leucite), plagioclase, and augite, together with olivine and lesser iron-titanium oxides such as ilmenite and magnetite-ulvospinel; minor alkali feldspar may be present. Clinopyroxene (augite) and olivine are common as phenocrysts and in the matrix. The augite contains significantly greater titanium, aluminium and sodium than that in typical tholeiitic basalt. Quartz is absent, as are orthopyroxene and pigeonite.

Chemically, basanites are mafic. They are low in silica (42 to 45% SiO2) and high in alkalis (3 to 5.5% Na2O and K2O) compared to basalt, which typically contains more SiO2, as evident on the diagram used for TAS classification. Nephelinite is yet richer in Na2O plus K2O compared to SiO2.

==Occurrences==

Basanite appears early in the alkaline magma series and basanites are found wherever alkaline magma is erupted. This includes both continental and ocean island settings. Together with basalts, they are produced by hotspot volcanism, for example in the Hawaiian Islands, the Comoros Islands and the Canary Islands. They are particularly common in areas of rifting.

During eruption of the Laacher See caldera some 12,900 years ago, the final phase of the eruption, which tapped the deepest part of the magma chamber, produced basanite lapilli mixed with phonolite lapilli. This has been interpreted as fresh magma injected into the magma chamber that may have helped trigger the eruption.

Eruption of basanite and other alkaline magmas characterizes the late alkaline phase (rejuvenation phase) of volcanic islands, which often comes 3 to 5 million years after the main shield-building phase.

<doc id="285245" wikidata="Q1777448" url="?curid=285245" title="Hardcore pornography">
<text>Hardcore pornography or hardcore porn is pornography that features detailed depictions of sexual organs or sexual acts such as vaginal, anal, oral, or manual intercourse; ejaculation; or fetish play. The term is in contrast with less-explicit softcore pornography. Hardcore pornography usually takes the form of photographs, films, and cartoons. Since the mid-1990s, hardcore pornography has become widely available on the internet, much of it without cost, making it more accessible than ever before.

==Etymology==
A distinction between &quot;hardcore pornography&quot; and &quot;borderline pornography&quot; (or &quot;borderline obscenity&quot;) was made in the 1950s and 1960s by American jurists discussing obscenity laws. &quot;Borderline pornography&quot; appealed to sexual prurience, but had other positive qualities, such as literary or artistic merit, and so was arguably permitted by obscenity laws; &quot;hardcore pornography&quot; lacked such merits and was definitely prohibited. In &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; (1957), the government brief distinguished three classes of sexual material: &quot;novels of apparently serious literary intent&quot;; &quot;borderline entertainment ... magazines, cartoons, nudist publications, etc.&quot;; and &quot;hard core pornography, which no one would suggest had literary merit&quot;. Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen in 1959 distinguished &quot;erotic realism&quot; from &quot;pornography&quot;; in the latter &quot;the main purpose is to stimulate erotic response in the reader. And that is all.&quot; Most famously, in &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot; (1964), Potter Stewart wrote:
:I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description [&quot;hard-core pornography&quot;], and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case [&quot;The Lovers&quot;] is not that.

In &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot; and other cases, the United States Supreme Court ruled that only &quot;hardcore&quot; pornography could be prohibited by obscenity laws, with the rest protected by the First Amendment. The category of &quot;borderline obscenity&quot; thus became obsolete. The 1970 report of the President&#x27;s Commission on Obscenity and Pornography said:

From the 1970s, the salient distinction was between hardcore pornography and softcore pornography, which may use simulated sex and limits the range and intensity of depictions of sexual activities. For example, William Rotsler&#x27;s 1973 classification subdivided the X rating for erotic films: &quot;The XXX-rating means hard-core, the XX-rating is for simulation, and an X-rating is for comparatively cool films.&quot;

==History==
The prehistory of modern pornography is the classical American stag film, also known as &quot;blue movies&quot;, a body of clandestine short pornographic films produced during the first two-thirds of the 20th century. While the exact corpus of the distinctive stag film remains unknown, scholars at the Kinsey Institute believe there are approximately 2000 films produced between 1915 and 1968. Stag cinema is a form of hardcore film and is characterized as silent, usually filling a single reel or less, and was illegally made and exhibited because of censorship laws in America. Women were excluded from these private screenings that were shown in American &quot;smoker&quot; houses such as fraternities or other exclusive institutions. In Europe, films of the same kind were screened in brothels. The mode of reception of the all-male audience of stag films was raucous, collective sexual banter and sexual arousal. Film historians describe stag films as a primitive form of cinema because they were produced by anonymous and amateur male artists who failed to achieve narrative coherence and continuity. Today, many of these films have been archived by the Kinsey Institute, but most are in a state of decay and have no copyright, real credits, or acknowledged authorship. The stag film era inevitably ended with the beginnings of the sexual revolution in the fifties in combination with the new technologies of the post-war era, such as 16 mm, 8 mm, and the Super 8. American stag cinema in general received scholarly attention first in the mid-seventies by heterosexual males, e.g. Di Lauro and Gerald Rabkin&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; (1976) and more recently by feminist and queer cultural historians, e.g. Linda M. Williams&#x27; &quot;Hard Core: Power Pleasure, and the &quot;Frenzy of the Visible&quot;&quot; (1989) and Thomas Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Homosociality in the Classical American Stag Film: Off-Screen, On-screen&quot; (2001).

==Legality==
The distribution of hardcore pornography had been widely prohibited in many countries until the second half of the 20th century, when many countries began to allow some dissemination of softcore material. Supply is now usually regulated by a motion picture rating system as well as by direct regulation of points of sale. Restrictions, as applicable, apply to the screening, or rental, sale, or giving of a movie, in the form of a DVD, video, computer file, etc. Public display and advertising of hardcore pornography is often prohibited, as is its supply to minors.

Most countries have eased the restrictions on the distribution of pornography, either by general or restricted legalization or by failure to enforce prohibitive legislation. Most easing of restrictions has been by way of changes to the criteria of a country&#x27;s movie classification system. The anti-pornography movement often vigorously opposes legalization. In 1969, Denmark became the first country in the world to legalize pornography. In the U.S., legal interpretations of pornography in relation to the constitutional right to free speech differ from state to state and from city to city. Hardcore pornography was legalized in the UK in May 2000.

===United Kingdom===
&quot;The Independent&quot; reported in 2006 that Nielsen NetRatings found that more than nine million British male adults used Internet porn services. The study also reported a one-third rise in the number of women visiting X-rated sites, from 1.05 million to 1.38 million. A 2003 study found that one third of all British Internet users accessed hardcore porn.

===United States===
A 2005 study by Eric Schlosser estimated that revenues from hardcore porn matched Hollywood&#x27;s domestic box office takings. Hardcore porn videos, Internet sites, live sex acts and cable TV programming generated US$10 billion, roughly equal to U.S. domestic box office receipts.

== Impact on society ==
Berl Kutchinsky&#x27;s &quot;Studies on Pornography and Sex Crimes in Denmark&quot; (1970), a scientific report commissioned by the United States&#x27; Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, found that the legalizing of pornography in Denmark had not (as had been expected) resulted in an increase of sex crimes.

A study conducted in Denmark in 2003 and later published in &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; found that Danish men and women generally believe that hardcore pornography has a positive influence on their lives.

<text>Dunite (), also known as olivinite (not to be confused with the mineral olivenite), is an intrusive igneous rock of ultramafic composition and with phaneritic (coarse-grained) texture. The mineral assemblage is greater than 90% olivine, with minor amounts of other minerals such as pyroxene, chromite, magnetite, and pyrope. Dunite is the olivine-rich endmember of the peridotite group of mantle-derived rocks.

Dunite and other peridotite rocks are considered the major constituents of the Earth&#x27;s mantle above a depth of about . Dunite is rarely found within continental rocks, but where it is found, it typically occurs at the base of ophiolite sequences where slabs of mantle rock from a subduction zone have been thrust onto continental crust by obduction during continental or island arc collisions (orogeny). It is also found in alpine peridotite massifs that represent slivers of sub-continental mantle exposed during collisional orogeny. Dunite typically undergoes retrograde metamorphism in near-surface environments and is altered to serpentinite and soapstone.

The type of dunite found in the lowermost parts of ophiolites, alpine peridotite massifs, and xenoliths may represent the refractory residue left after the extraction of basaltic magmas in the upper mantle. However, a more likely method of dunite formation in mantle sections is by interaction between lherzolite or harzburgite and percolating silicate melts, which dissolve orthopyroxene from the surrounding rock, leaving a progressively olivine-enriched residue.

Dunite may also form by the accumulation of olivine crystals on the floor of large basaltic or picritic magma chambers. These &quot;cumulate&quot; dunites typically occur in thick layers in layered intrusions, associated with cumulate layers of wehrlite, olivine pyroxenite, harzburgite, and even chromitite (a cumulate rock consisting largely of chromite). Small layered intrusions may be of any geologic age, for example, the Triassic Palisades Sill in New York and the larger Eocene Skaergaard complex in Greenland. The largest layered mafic intrusions are tens of kilometers in size and almost all are Proterozoic in age, e.g. the Stillwater igneous complex (Montana), the Muskox intrusion (Canada), and the Great Dyke (Zimbabwe). Cumulate dunite may also be found in ophiolite complexes, associated with layers of wehrlite, pyroxenite, and gabbro.

Dunite was named by the Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter in 1859, after Dun Mountain near Nelson, New Zealand. Dun Mountain was given its name because of the dun colour of the underlying ultramafic rocks. This color results from surface weathering that oxidizes the iron in olivine in temperate climates (weathering in tropical climates creates a deep red soil). The dunite from Dun Mountain is part of the ultramafic section of the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt.

A massive exposure of dunite in the United States can be found as Twin Sisters Mountain, near Mount Baker in the northern Cascade Range of Washington. In Europe it occurs in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus. In southern British Columbia, Canada dunite rocks form the core of an ultramafic rock complex located near the small community of Tulameen. The rocks are locally enriched in platinum group metals, chromite and magnetite.

==Carbon sequestration potential==

Dunite could be used to sequester CO2 and help mitigate global climate change via accelerated chemical rock weathering. This would involve the mining of dunite rocks in quarries followed by crushing and grinding to create fine ground rock that would react with the atmospheric carbon dioxide. The resulting products are magnesite and silica which could be commercialized.

<doc id="285247" wikidata="Q744630" url="?curid=285247" title="Migmatite">
<text>Migmatite is a composite rock found in medium and high-grade metamorphic environments, commonly within Precambrian cratonic blocks. It consists of two or more constituents often layered repetitively: one layer is an older metamorphic rock that was reconstituted subsequently by partial melting (&quot;paleosome&quot;), while the alternate layer has a pegmatitic, aplitic, granitic or generally plutonic appearance (&quot;neosome&quot;). Commonly, migmatites occur below deformed metamorphic rocks that represent the base of eroded mountain chains.

Migmatites form under extreme temperature and pressure conditions during prograde metamorphism, when partial melting occurs in metamorphic paleosome. Components exsolved by partial melting are called neosome (meaning ‘new body’), which may or may not be heterogeneous at the microscopic to macroscopic scale. Migmatites often appear as tightly, incoherently folded veins (ptygmatic folds). These form segregations of leucosome, light-colored granitic components exsolved within melanosome, a dark colored amphibole- and biotite-rich setting. If present, a mesosome, intermediate in color between a leucosome and melanosome, forms a more or less unmodified remnant of the metamorphic parent rock paleosome. The light-colored components often give the appearance of having been molten and mobilized.

==The diagenesis - metamorphism sequence==

Migmatite is the penultimate member of a sequence of lithology transformations first identified by Lyell, 1837. Lyell had a clear perception of the regional diagenesis sequence in sedimentary rocks that remains valid today. It begins &#x27;A&#x27; with deposition of unconsolidated sediment (protolith for future metamorphic rocks). As temperature and pressure increase with depth, a protolith passes through a diagenetic sequence from porous sedimentary rock through indurated rocks and phyllites &#x27;A2&#x27; to metamorphic schists &#x27;C1&#x27; in which the initial sedimentary components can still be discerned. Deeper still, the schists are reconstituted as gneiss &#x27;C2&#x27; in which folia of residual minerals alternate with quartzo-feldspathic layers; partial melting continues as small batches of leucosome coalesce to form distinct layers in the neosome, and become recognizable migmatite &#x27;D1&#x27;. The resulting leucosome layers in &quot;stromatic&quot; migmatites still retain water and gas in a discontinuous reaction series from the paleosome. This supercritical H2O and CO2 content renders the leucosome extremely mobile.

Bowen 1922, p184 described the process as being ‘In part due to … reactions between already crystallized mineral components of the rock and the remaining still-molten magma, and in part to reactions due to adjustments of equilibrium between the extreme end-stage, highly concentrated, &quot;mother-liquor&quot;, which, by selective freezing, has been enriched with the more volatile gases usually termed &quot;mineralizers,&quot; among which water figures prominently’. J.J. Sederholm (1926) described rocks of this type, demonstrably of mixed origin, as migmatites. He described the granitising &#x27;ichors&#x27; as having properties intermediate between an aqueous solution and a very much diluted magma, with much of it in the gaseous state.

==Partial melting, anatexis and the role of water==
The role of partial melting is demanded by experimental and field evidence. Rocks begin to partially melt when they reach a combination of sufficiently high temperatures (&gt; 650 °C) and pressures (&gt;34MPa). Some rocks have compositions that produce more melt than others at a given temperature, a rock property called &quot;fertility&quot;. Some minerals in a sequence will make more melt than others; some do not melt until a higher temperature is reached. If the temperature attained only just surpasses the solidus, the migmatite will contain a few small patches of melt scattered about in the most fertile rock. Holmquist 1916 called the process whereby metamorphic rocks are transformed into granulite ‘anatexis’.

The segregation of melt during the prograde part of the metamorphic history (temperature &gt; solidus) involves separating the melt fraction from the residuum, which higher specific gravity causes to accumulate at a lower level. The subsequent migration of anatectic melt flows down local pressure gradients with little or no crystallization. The network of channels through which the melt moved at this stage may be lost by compression of the melanosome, leaving isolated lenses of leucosome. The melt product gathers in an underlying channel where it becomes subject to differentiation. 
Conduction is the principal mechanism of heat transfer in the continental crust; where shallow layers have been exhumed or buried rapidly there is a corresponding inflection in the geothermal gradient. Cooling due to surface exposure is conducted very slowly to deeper rocks so the deeper crust is slow to heat up and slow to cool. Numerical models of crustal heating confirm slow cooling in the deep crust. Therefore, once formed, anatectic melt can exist in the middle and lower crust for a very long period of time. It is squeezed laterally to form sills, laccolithic and lopolithic structures of mobile granulite at depths of c. 10–20 km. In outcrop today only stages of this process arrested during its initial rapid uplift are visible. Wherever the resulting fractionated granulite rises steeply in the crust, water exits from its supercriticality phase, the granulite starts to crystallize, becomes firstly fractionated melt + crystals, then solid rock, whilst still at the conditions of temperature and pressure existing beyond 8 km. Water, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and other elements are exsolved under great pressure from the melt as it exits from supercritical conditions. These components rise rapidly towards the surface and contribute to formation of mineral deposits, volcanoes, mud volcanoes, geysers and hot springs.

== Color-banded migmatites==

A leucosome is the lightest-colored part of migmatite. The melanosome is the darker part, and occurs between two leucosomes or, if remnants of the more or less unmodified parent rock (mesosome) are still present, it is arranged in rims around these remnants. When present, the mesosome is intermediate in color between leucosome and melanosome.

The melanosome is a dark, mafic mineral band formed in migmatite which is melting into a eutaxitic texture; often, this leads to the formation of granite. The melanosomes form bands with leucosomes, and in that context may be described as &quot;schlieren&quot; (color banding) or &quot;migmatitic&quot;.

==Migmatite textures==
Migmatite textures are the product of thermal softening of the metamorphic rocks. Schlieren textures are a particularly common example of granite formation in migmatites, and are often seen in restite xenoliths and around the margins of S-type granites.

Ptygmatic folds are formed by highly plastic ductile deformation of the gneissic banding, and thus have little or no relationship to a defined foliation, unlike most regular folds. Ptygmatic folds can occur restricted to compositional zones of the migmatite, for instance in fine-grained shale protoliths versus in coarse granoblastic sandy protolith.

When a rock undergoes partial melting some minerals will melt (neosome, i.e. newly formed), while others remain solid (paleosome, i.e. older formation). The neosome is composed of lightly colored areas (leucosome) and dark areas (melanosome). The leucosome lies in the center of the layers and is mainly composed of quartz and feldspar. The melanosome is composed of cordierite, hornblende and biotite and forms the wall zones of the neosome.

== Early history of migmatite investigations==

In 1795 James Hutton made some of the earliest comments on the relationship between gneiss and granite: “If granite be truly stratified, and those strata connected with the other strata of the earth, it can have no claim to originality; and the idea of primitive mountains, of late so much employed by natural philosophers, must vanish, in a more extensive view of the operations of the globe; but it is certain that granite, or a species of the same kind of stone, is thus found stratified. It is the granit feuilletée of M. de Saussure, and, if I mistake not, what is called gneis by the Germans.” The minute penetration of gneiss, schists and sedimentary deposits altered by contact-metamorphism, alternating with granitic materials along the planes of schistosity was described by Michel-Lévy, in his 1887 paper &#x27; Sur l&#x27;Origine des Terrains Cristallins Primitifs&#x27;. He makes the following observations: “I first drew attention to the phenomenon of intimate penetration, ‘lit par lit’ of eruptive granitic and granulitic rocks that follow the schistosity planes of gneisses and schists ... But in between, in the contact zones Immediately above eruptive rock, quartz and feldspars insert themselves, bed by bed, between the leaves of the micaceous shales; it started from a detrital shale, now we find it definitively transformed into a recent gneiss, very difficult to distinguish from ancient gneiss”.

The coincidence of schistosity with bedding gave rise to the proposals of static or load metamorphism, advanced in 1889 by John Judd and others. In 1894 L. Milch recognized vertical pressure due to the weight of the overlying load to be the controlling factor. In 1896
Home and Greenly agreed that granitic intrusions are closely associated with metamorphic processes &quot; the cause which brought about the introduction of the granite also resulted in these high and peculiar types of crystallization &quot;. A later paper of Edward Greenly in 1903 described the formation of granitic gneisses by solid diffusion, and ascribed the mechanism of lit-par-lit occurrence to the same process. Greenly drew attention to thin and regular seams of injected material, which indicated that these operations took place in hot rocks; also to undisturbed septa of country rocks, which suggested that the expression of the magma occurred by quiet diffusion rather than by forcible injection. In 1907 Sederholm called the migmatite-forming process palingenesis. and (although it specifically included partial melting and dissolution) he considered magma injection and its associated veined and brecciated rocks as fundamental to the process. The upward succession of gneiss, schist and phyllite in the Central European Urgebirge influenced Ulrich Grubenmann in 1910 in his formulation of three depth-zones of metamorphism. 
Holmquist found high-grade gneisses that contained many small patches and veins of granitic material. Granites were absent nearby, so he interpreted the patches and veins to be collection sites for partial melt exuded from the mica-rich parts of the host gneiss. Holmquist gave these migmatites the name ‘venite’ to emphasize their internal origin and to distinguish them from Sederholm&#x27;s ‘arterites’. Which also contained veins of injected material. Sederholm later placed more emphasis on the roles of assimilation and the actions of fluids in the formation of migmatites and used the term ‘ichor’, to describe them.

Persuaded by the close connection between migmatization and granites in outcrop, Sederholm considered migmatites to be an intermediary between igneous and metamorphic rocks. He thought that the granitic partings in banded gneisses originated through the agency of either melt or a nebulous fluid, &quot;the ichor&quot;, both derived from nearby granites. An opposing view, proposed by Holmquist, was that the granitic material came from the adjacent country rock, not the granites, and that it was segregated by fluid transport. Holmquist believed that such replacive migmatites were produced during metamorphism at a relatively low metamorphic grade, with partial melting only intervening at high grade. Thus, the modern view of migmatites corresponds closely to Holmquist&#x27;s concept of ultrametamorphism, and to Sederholm&#x27;s concept of anatexis, but is far from the concept of palingenesis, or the various metasomatic and subsolidus processes proposed during the granitization debate. Read considered that regionally metamorphosed rocks resulted from the passage of waves or fronts of metasomatizing solutions out from the central granitization core, above which arise the zones of metamorphism.

==Agmatite== 
The original name for this phenomenon was defined by Sederholm (1923) as a rock with &quot;fragments of older rock cemented by granite&quot;, and was regarded by him to be a type of migmatite. There is a close connection between migmatites and the occurrence of ‘explosion breccias’ in schists and phyllites adjacent to diorite and granite intrusions. Rocks matching this description can also be found around igneous intrusive bodies in low-grade or unmetamorphosed country-rocks. Brown (1973) argued that agmatites are not migmatites, and should be called ‘intrusion breccias’ or ‘vent agglomerates’. Reynolds (1951) thought the term ‘agmatite’ ought to be abandoned.

==Migmatite melts provide buoyancy for sedimentary isostasy ==
Recent geochronological studies from granulite-facies metamorphic terranes (e.g. Willigers et al. 2001) show that metamorphic temperatures remained above the granite solidus for between 30 and 50 My. This suggests that once formed, anatectic melt can exist in the middle and lower crust for a very long period of time. The resulting granulite is free to move laterally and up along weaknesses in the overburden in directions determined by the pressure gradient.

In areas where it lies beneath a deepening sedimentary basin, a portion of granulite melt will tend to move laterally beneath the base of previously metamorphosed rocks that have not yet reached the migmatic stage of anatexis. It will congregate in areas where pressure is lower. The melt will lose its volatile content when it reaches a level where temperature and pressure is less than the supercritical water phase boundary. The melt will crystallize at that level and prevent following melt from reaching that level until persistent following magma pressure pushes the overburden upwards.

==Other migmatite hypotheses==
For migmatised argillaceous rocks, the partial or fractional melting would first produce a volatile and incompatible-element enriched rich partial melt of granitic composition. Such granites derived from sedimentary rock protoliths would be termed &quot;S-type granite&quot;, are typically potassic, sometimes containing leucite, and would be termed adamellite, granite and syenite. Volcanic equivalents would be rhyolite and rhyodacite.

Migmatised igneous or lower-crustal rocks which melt do so to form a similar granitic &quot;I-type granite&quot; melt, but with distinct geochemical signatures and typically plagioclase dominant mineralogy forming monzonite, tonalite and granodiorite compositions. Volcanic equivalents would be dacite and trachyte.

It is difficult to melt mafic metamorphic rocks except in the lower mantle, so it is rare to see migmatitic textures in such rocks. However, eclogite and granulite are roughly equivalent mafic rocks.

==Etymology==
The Finnish petrologist Jakob Sederholm first used the term in 1907 for rocks within the Scandinavian craton in southern Finland. The term was derived from the Greek word &quot;μιγμα&quot;: , meaning a mixture.

<text>Tonalite is an igneous, plutonic (intrusive) rock, of felsic composition, with phaneritic (coarse-grained) texture. Feldspar is present as plagioclase (typically oligoclase or andesine) with alkali feldspar making up less than 10% of the total feldspar content. Quartz (SiO2) is present as more than 20% of the total quartz-alkali feldspar-plagioclase-feldspathoid (QAPF) content of the rock. Amphiboles and biotite are common in lesser quantities, while accessory minerals include apatite, magnetite and zircon.

In older references tonalite is sometimes used as a synonym for quartz diorite. However the current IUGS classification defines tonalite as having greater than 20% quartz, while quartz diorite varies its quartz content from 5 to 20%.

The name is derived from the type locality of tonalites, adjacent to the Tonale Line, a major structural lineament and mountain pass, Tonale Pass, in the Italian and Austrian Alps. The name was first applied by Gerhard vom Rath in 1864. The term &quot;adamellite&quot; was originally applied by A. Cathrein in 1890 to orthoclase-bearing tonalite (likely a granodiorite) at Monte Adamello, Italy, in 1890, but later came to refer to quartz monzonite, and is now a deprecated term.

Trondhjemite is an orthoclase-deficient variety of sodium-rich tonalite with minor biotite as the only mafic mineral, named after Norway&#x27;s third largest city, Trondheim.

Tonalites, together with granodiorites, are characteristic of calc-alkaline batholiths formed above subduction zones.

<doc id="285249" wikidata="Q1269190" url="?curid=285249" title="Hybristophilia">
<text>Hybristophilia is a paraphilia involving sexual interest in and attraction to those who commit crimes. Many high-profile criminals, particularly those who have committed atrocious crimes, receive &quot;fan mail&quot; in prison that is sometimes amorous or sexual, presumably because of this phenomenon. While less common, hybristophilia can also occur in men with female serial killers. In some cases, admirers of these criminals have gone on to marry the object of their affections in prison. In popular culture, this phenomenon is also known as the &quot;[[Bonnie and Clyde]] syndrome&quot;.

The term &quot;hybristophilia&quot; is coined by John Money in 1986 and is derived from the Greek word (), meaning &quot;to commit an outrage against someone&quot; (ultimately derived from , &quot;hubris&quot;), and &quot;philo&quot;, meaning &quot;having a strong affinity/preference for&quot;.

== Causes ==
Some speculations have been offered as to the cause of hybristophilia. Katherine Ramsland, a professor of forensic psychology at DeSales University, discusses the condition in women and mentions that some of the women who have married or dated male serial killers have offered the following reasons:
* &quot;Some believe they can change a man as cruel and powerful as a serial killer.&quot;
* &quot;Others &#x27;see&#x27; the little boy that the killer once was and seek to nurture him.&quot;
* &quot;A few hoped to share in the media spotlight or get a book or movie deal.&quot;
* &quot;Then there&#x27;s the notion of the &#x27;perfect boyfriend&#x27;. She knows where he is at all times, and she knows he&#x27;s thinking about her. While she can claim that someone loves her, she does not have to endure the day-to-day issues involved in most relationships. There&#x27;s no laundry to do, no cooking for him, and no accountability to him. She can keep the fantasy charged up for a long time.&quot;
Others offered reasons along the lines of: &quot;Some mental health experts have compared infatuation with killers to extreme forms of fanaticism. They view such individuals as insecure people who cannot find love in normal ways or as &#x27;love-avoidant&#x27; females who seek romantic relationships that cannot be consummated.&quot; Psychologist Leon F. Seltzer proposes the condition could be related to the riskiness involved with dating a criminal, the desire to tame or fix them, and primitive instincts based on evolutionary psychology. In the latter theory, he mentions dominance is attractive as it would mean such men could protect women and their offspring, according to evolutionary history. Seltzer says women today may consciously realize that it is unwise to date a serial killer, but they are nevertheless attracted to them; he stated, &quot;as a therapist I&#x27;ve encountered many women who bemoaned their vulnerability toward dominant men who, consciously, they recognized were all wrong for them&quot;.

As evidence of women&#x27;s fantasy preference for dominant men, he refers to the book &quot;A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the World&#x27;s Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire&quot; by Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam. Seltzer discusses Ogas and Gaddam&#x27;s argument that this fantasy is the dominant plot of most erotic/romantic books and movies written for women, but the fantasy always holds that this male dominance is conditional, &quot;it doesn&#x27;t really represent the man&#x27;s innermost reality&quot;. He also says in reality, very few women are actually swayed by these &quot;primitive instincts&quot;.

Elizabeth Gurian wrote that hybristophilia may be a result of an individual being the victim of abuse or having a seeking behavior. Social media contributions for an easier method of showcasing attraction to the criminal hybristophilia have also been noted about; a 2023 paper stated that &quot;If social media platforms including TikTok provide users with the ability to freely express themselves publicly and anonymously, then individuals wanting to showcase and share their affection and admiration for criminal offenders might opt to utilize these platforms for this purpose.&quot; A linkage was also made to the case of it being for the purpose of &#x27;controlling fear&#x27;, in which people consciously or unconsciously deny the threat in accordance with the extended parallel process model.

Women who write love letters to or even pursue men who are incarcerated for a crime are sometimes referred to as a &quot;prison groupie&quot; or a &quot;serial killer groupie&quot;.

== Notable examples ==
* One of the most infamous examples of hybristophilia is the large number of women attracted to Ted Bundy after his arrest. He often drew scores of women at the jammed courtrooms of his trials each day. Bundy allegedly received hundreds of love letters from women while he was incarcerated, and married a woman, Carole Ann Boone, whom he had met while both were working in Washington. He proposed to her in the middle of proceedings while Boone was on the witness stand. Boone gave birth to a daughter whom it was believed Bundy had fathered.
* Jeffrey Dahmer, a serial killer, is said to have had amorous women sending him letters, money, and other gifts during his time in prison despite being a gay man and a cannibal.
* Richard Ramirez, the &quot;Night Stalker&quot; who killed 13 people and had &quot;more than a passing interest&quot; in Satanism, had fans who would write him letters and pay him visits. This included Doreen Lioy, who married him in California&#x27;s San Quentin State Prison on October 3, 1996. However, Lioy eventually broke ties with Ramirez in 2009 after DNA confirmed he had raped and murdered 9-year-old Mei Leung, though it seems she never legally filed for divorce.
* Cult leader orchestrator Charles Manson&#x27;s fangirls are also examples.
* Terrorists such as Ted Kaczynski, Timothy McVeigh, Anders Behring Breivik, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have also been the objects of hybristophilia.
*School shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold have been notable for being posthumously subjected to hybristophilia.
*Karla Homolka, a serial killer who acted as an accomplice to her husband Paul Bernardo, is considered to be a hybristophile by some forensic psychiatrists.
*Jeremy Meeks, following his 2014 arrest for felony weapon charges, went viral on Facebook for his appearance in his mugshot. After his release, he became a fashion model.

<text>Hans Eworth (or Ewouts; ) was a Flemish painter active in England in the mid-16th century. Along with other exiled Flemings, he made a career in Tudor London, painting allegorical images as well as portraits of the gentry and nobility. About 40 paintings are now attributed to Eworth, among them portraits of Mary I and Elizabeth I. Eworth also executed decorative commissions for Elizabeth&#x27;s Office of the Revels in the early 1570s.

==Career==

Nothing is known of Eworth&#x27;s early life or training. As ″Jan Euworts″, he is recorded as a freeman of the artists&#x27; Guild of St Luke in Antwerp in 1540. A ″Jan and Nicholas Ewouts, painter and mercer″ were expelled from Antwerp for heresy in 1544 and scholars generally accept that this Jan is the same individual. By 1545 Eworth was resident in London, where he is well recorded (under a wide variety of spellings) from 1549.

Eworth&#x27;s earliest surviving works also date from 1549 to 1550. These include the allegorical portrait of Sir John Luttrell with the goddess Pax, commemorating Luttrell&#x27;s military exploits and the Treaty of Boulogne (24 March 1550) which finally brought peace between England, Scotland, and France after the long wars known as the Rough Wooing. The original – signed with the &quot;HE&quot; monogram Eworth consistently used
— was donated to the Courtauld Institute of Art by Lord Lee of Farnham in 1932. The painting was in &quot;badly damaged&quot; condition when it was donated to the institute, although it has subsequently been conserved and restored.

Although there is no direct evidence that Eworth&#x27;s most important patron was the Catholic queen Mary I, most scholars now accept this to be the case. All his known portraits of Mary I appear to be variants of a portrait in the National Portrait Gallery, London () which is signed &#x27;HE&#x27; and dated 1554 at the top left. A second portrait, now in the Society of Antiquaries collection, is also signed and dated 1554. Two other portraits show Mary I in later fashions and are thought to have been painted between 1555 and Mary&#x27;s death in 1558. Another is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge. However, after Mary I&#x27;s death and the change of the political and religious atmosphere with the accession of Elizabeth I, Eworth in 1560 painted the Protestant Martyr Anne Askew, burned at the stake on charges of heresy.

Over the next decade, Eworth continued to paint portraits of the aristocracy, including paired portraits of the Duke of Norfolk and his second wife and of the Earl and Countess of Moray.

Despite the frequent appearance of a characteristic &quot;HE&quot; monogram, the attribution of works to Eworth—and the identification of his sitters—remains in flux. A well-known painting identified by George Vertue in 1727 as Lady Frances Brandon and her second husband Adrian Stokes has now been correctly identified as Mary Nevill or Neville, Baroness Dacre and her son Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre. The allegorical painting &quot;Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses&quot; (1569), with its slightly different &quot;HE&quot; monogram, has been variously attributed by Sir Roy Strong as cautiously to &quot;The Monogrammist HE&quot; in 1969 and more confidently to Joris Hoefnagel in 1987; it is now accepted as the work of Eworth. Eworth&#x27;s last known works date from 1570 to 1573.

Like many other artists of the Tudor court, Eworth was also engaged in decorative work; he was involved in the set design for a masque given by Elizabeth I in honor of the French Ambassador in 1572. Payment records show that Eworth was designing for the Office of the Revels as late as 1573, and he is believed to have died in 1574.

<text>The Hypertext Editing System, or HES, was an early hypertext research project conducted at Brown University in 1967 by Andries van Dam, Ted Nelson, and several Brown students. It was the first hypertext system available on commercial equipment that novices could use.

HES organized data into two main types: links and branching text. The branching text could automatically be arranged into menus, and a point within a given area could also have an assigned name, called a label, and be accessed later by that name from the screen. Although HES pioneered many modern hypertext concepts, its emphasis was on text formatting and printing.

HES required an IBM 2250 display console and a large memory partition on Brown&#x27;s IBM System/360 Model 50 campus mainframe computer which limited its use: &quot;Although it was shared with others, it was a multi-million-dollar piece of technology housed in a large machine room that van Dam’s team was able to use as essentially a personal computer between midnight and 4 AM.&quot; The program was used by NASA&#x27;s Houston Manned Spacecraft Center for documentation on the Apollo space program. The project&#x27;s research was funded by IBM but the program was stopped around 1969, and replaced by the FRESS (File Retrieval and Editing System) project.

Ted Nelson claims credit for inventing the “back” button (“undo”) with regard to hypertext, as the Hypertext Editing System was the first system that contained one.

The HES editor was followed by another editing system called the File Retrieval and Editing System (FRESS).

<text>Belgium is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.

Belgium&#x27;s strongly globalized economy and its transport infrastructure are integrated with the rest of Europe. Its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world&#x27;s 15th largest trading nation in 2007. The economy is characterized by a highly productive work force, high GNP and high exports per capita. Belgium&#x27;s main imports are raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemicals, raw diamonds, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, transportation equipment, and oil products. Its main exports are machinery and equipment, chemicals, finished diamonds, metals and metal products, and foodstuffs.

<doc id="285261" wikidata="Q1658505" url="?curid=285261" title="Petrofina">
<text>Petrofina was a Belgian oil company. It merged with Total in 1999 to form TotalFina, which after subsequent mergers has changed its name back to Total. In the United States, Fina&#x27;s former refining and marketing operations are now owned by Delek US.

Petrofina was founded on 25 February 1920 by Auguste Diagre, Hector Carlier his brother Fernand and Aloys Van de Vyvere as an Antwerp-based group called Compagnie Financière Belge des Pétroles, but changed to PetroFina to reflect their telegraphic address name.

In 1981, Petrofina sold its Canadian retail operations in eastern Canada to the Canadian government and became part of Petro-Canada.

Petrofina merged with Total S.A. of France to form TotalFina and with Elf in 2000 to form TotalFinaElf. The company&#x27;s current name is TotalEnergies (since 2021).

==Fina in the United States - &quot;Pink Air&quot; and &quot;Pflash&quot;==

Petrofina expanded its operations to the United States in 1956 with the purchase of Texas-based Panhandle Oil Company, which was headquartered in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the firm operated an oil refinery and marketed gasoline through service stations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. American Petrofina, as the United States operation was called, further expanded its presence in the US through the purchase of several small oil companies, the largest being the Cosden Oil Company from W.R. Grace in 1963, which gave Fina a very large chain of service stations in Texas and New Mexico along with an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas.

The Fina brand appeared on gasoline and other petroleum products at Panhandle stations in 1958, with the service stations rebranded as Fina in 1959 and service stations acquired through purchase of Cosden and other companies also converted to the Fina brand. In 1961, Fina introduced its Pink Air promotional campaign noting that while Fina gasolines were loaded with all the same ingredients that made their fuels &quot;Exactly As Good As The Best&quot; adding that only at Fina stations could motorists get &quot;Pink Air&quot; for their tires to keep them from deteriorating. In its &quot;Pink Air&quot; ads, Fina (then undergoing a major expansion of its marketing territory which encompassed the Mid-Continent region from Texas to Minnesota) noted that Pink Air was arriving at new Fina stations as fast as they could be opened and set a goal of having Pink Air in all of its stations by May 1966 - five years later.

In 1966, when &quot;Pink Air&quot; finally arrived at every Fina station, Fina replaced that campaign with a new one regarding an ingredient in its gasoline called &quot;Pflash.&quot; At a time when other US oil companies were promoting their gasoline products with campaigns such as Exxon/Esso&#x27;s &quot;Put A Tiger in Your Tank!&quot;, Shell&#x27;s &quot;Platformate&quot; additive that they claimed to improve gas mileage, Texaco&#x27;s invitation to &quot;Trust Your Car to the Man Who Wears The Star&quot; and Mobil&#x27;s &quot;Detergent gasoline&quot;; &quot;&quot;PFLASH&quot;, was promoted as an ingredient in Fina gasoline that would improve driving pleasure by &quot;turning red lights green,&quot; &quot;smoothing out rough roads,&quot; &quot;improving the food at roadside restaurants&quot; and &quot;making you feel less sorry you ever got a driver&#x27;s license.&quot; Fina stations even offered free &quot;Pflash&quot; bumper stickers to motorists who pulled in for gasoline purchases.

In 1973, American Petrofina expanded its marketing area to include Florida, Georgia and several other Southeastern states following the purchase of BP&#x27;s marketing assets including service stations, terminals and jobber contracts, converting them to the Fina brand. Another expansion of Fina&#x27;s marketing operations came in 1984, when American Petrofina purchased several thousand service stations from Oklahoma-based Champlin Refining Company following that firm&#x27;s closing of its Enid, Oklahoma refinery. The Champlin assets were rebranded as Fina stations in several Mid-Continent states including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa among others.

Petrofina&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary, Fina Inc., announced that it would move its headquarters to Houston from Plano, Texas in 2000. Fina Inc. planned to occupy in the World Houston Plaza building, near George Bush Intercontinental Airport.

In 2005, Total Petrochemicals USA, Inc., moved to offices in downtown Houston. Petrochemicals USA, Inc. has retained the petrochemicals operations of the former Fina, and the Port Arthur, Texas refinery.

==US Fina assets now owned by Alon USA==
Since the Total-Petrofina merger in 1999, all of Fina&#x27;s former marketing assets and the Big Spring refinery have been owned by Texas-based Alon USA. Alon assets include the former Fina refinery at Big Spring, Texas and the Fina brand name. Alon supplies gasoline and other petroleum products to 1,200 Fina stations directly and through distributors in seven Southwestern states including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Arizona and the southern portion of Colorado. Alon also owns Southwest Convenience Stores, which is the largest franchiser of 7-Eleven convenience stores in the United States. Southwest owns and operates 160 7-Eleven stores in West Texas and New Mexico, each of which sell Fina gasoline.
In 2012, Alon announced it would be converting all of its retail locations to the Alon gasoline brand, rather than extend the contract they had with TotalElf which lasted 12 years to keep using the Fina brand. Doing so would also allow them to expand beyond the original eight state territory they could use the Fina name in (Arizona, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Louisiana, Colorado, and New Mexico). This conversion was completed by the end of 2012 at all former Fina locations.

The Fina Port Arthur refinery is still owned by Total.

==BMW Motorsport==

Fina were BMW&#x27;s primary oil &amp; lubricants partner from 1988 to 1998, featuring on all of BMW Motorsport&#x27;s works team racing cars beginning with the 1988 European Touring Car Championship, through entries in the World Rally Championship, British Touring Car Championship, the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) until 1992 and the German Super Tourenwagen Cup (STW). Fina also supported BMW&#x27;s in the French Touring Car Championship (Supertourisme), and both Rafanelli and Schnitzer Motorsport&#x27;s 24 Hours of Le Mans entries, plus the works McLaren-BMW F1 GTR and GTR Longtail from 1996 to 1998 at Le Mans and the FIA GT Championship.

==NASCAR sponsorship==

Fina was a major sponsor of NASCAR teams in the 1990s, most notably of Randy LaJoie&#x27;s Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) teams. Fina was LaJoie&#x27;s primary sponsor from 1993-1994, and then again from 1996-1998, which included two Busch Series championships in 1996 and 1997 in the #74 Fina Chevrolets owned by Bill Baumgartner.

<doc id="285262" wikidata="Q1505649" url="?curid=285262" title="Elf Aquitaine">
<text>Elf Aquitaine is a French brand of oils and other motor products (such as brake fluids) for automobiles and trucks. Elf is a former petroleum company which merged with TotalFina to form &quot;TotalFinaElf&quot;. The new company changed its name to Total in 2003 and TotalEnergies in 2021. Elf has been as a major brand of TotalEnergies since then.

== History ==
===Founding and mergers (1965–1979)===
Elf Aquitaine&#x27;s heritage is rooted among three French oil companies: &quot;Régie Autonome des Pétroles (RAP),&quot; &quot;Société Nationale des Pétroles d&#x27;Aquitaine (SNPA),&quot; and &quot;Bureau de Recherches de Pétroles (BRP&quot;). These entities were formed to exploit a gas field discovered in Saint-Marcet in the Aquitaine region of south-western France in 1939. 

In the early 1960s, with a view to create a French national champion with oil and gas considered as a strategic resource for economic development, under President de Gaulle&#x27;s leadership, further state-owned companies are set-up with specific objectives. 

* &quot;Union Générale de Distribution de produits pétroliers (UGD)&quot; is established in April 1960 with the aim to regroup and manage smaller, but competing private oil and gas companies such as &quot;Avia, Caltex, Solydit, ButaFrance, ButaLacq, Lacq, La Mure&quot; and &quot;CFPP.&quot;

* To counter the influence in refining activities owned by foreign conglomorerates &quot;Shell, BP, Esso&quot; and &quot;Mobil, Union Générale des Pétroles (UGP)&quot; is born a month later, with the mission to create and operate a network of refining facilities and distribution as well as continuing in oil and gas exploration via &quot;Groupement des exploitants pétroliers (GEP)&quot;.

In December 1965, RAP, SNPA and BRP are merged to form Entreprise de Recherches et d&#x27;Activités Pétrolières (ERAP), later Elf-ERAP, UGP eventually merged with UGD and integrated into the newly formed group. The resulting company achieved vertical integration, owning assets in all phases of the oil and gas business from exploration to production, refinery, distribution and research.

On April 28, 1967, the company&#x27;s disparate brands and products are unified under the Elf brand, &quot;Essence Lubricants France&quot; with Elf the first company to pioneer a completely synthetic racing oil. 

In 1973, Elf diversifies with subsidiary SNPA creating a pharmaceuticals subsidiary Sanofi and acquired the pharmaceutical groups Labaz, Castaigne, and Robilliart as well as the purchase of minor interests in a cosmetics company. 

In 1976, Elf-ERAP merge with Antar Pétroles de l&#x27;Atlantique to become Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine (SNEA), later Elf Aquitaine.

===Hoax and merger (1979–1993)===
In 1979, Elf Aquitaine lost over US$150 million in the Great Oil Sniffer Hoax to develop a new &quot;gravity wave-based oil detection system&quot;, which was later revealed to be a scam.

In 1981, Elf Aquitaine bought Texasgulf for US $3 billion, despite a request by the US government to postpone the merger for time to study the implications. At the time, Texasgulf was the largest producer of sulphur in the world, with Elf Aquitaine gaining majority control. Texasgulf was over one-third owned by the government of Canada. 

In 1991, Elf Aquitaine was listed on the NYSE. 

In 1993, Elf was awarded an exclusive contract to the Iraqi oil fields by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

=== Fraud scandals (1993-1996) ===
The Elf scandal which came to light in 1994 in France was according to &quot;The Guardian;&quot;&#x27;the biggest fraud inquiry in Europe since the Second World War... Elf became a private bank for executives who spent £200 million on political favours, mistresses, jewellery, fine art, villas and apartments&#x27;.
Iraqi-born Nadhmi Auchi, at that time rumoured to be among the ten richest men in Britain, received a 15-month suspended sentence and a £1.5m fine for his involvement taking illegal commissions. Auchi was also linked to the Clearstream scandal. He is BNP Paribas bank&#x27;s main private share-holder; and until 2001, the money for the Oil-for-Food programme transited through the escrow account of BNP Paribas. 

Moreover, magistrate Eva Joly investigated the case.
In the Leuna/Minol deal following German reunification, Elf Aquitaine took over circa 2,500 vacated gas station allottments in the former East Germany without paying the rightful owners.

===Merger and Total S.A. (1996–2022)===
In 1996, the French government sold its stake, retaining a golden share. 

In 2000, Elf Aquitaine merged with Total Fina to form TotalFinaElf, which changed its name to Total in 2003. 

Legal investigations into the company continued after it was purchased by Totalfina.

==Automobile and motorcycle partnerships==
Elf Aquitaine is an official recommended fuel and motor oil for all Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance marques (including Renault (shared with BP, Aral, and Castrol), Nissan, Dacia, Datsun, Alpine, Venucia, Renault Korea Motors and Infiniti) and Brough Superior for automobiles only as well as Kawasaki for motorcycles only.

==Motorsports==

From its very beginnings, Elf used motor racing as a means of promotion. It began with a four-year association with Matra in a French Formula Three program. This resulted in Henri Pescarolo winning the title. The European Formula Two Championship fell to Matra the following year with Jean-Pierre Beltoise. In 1969, the combination won the Formula One World Championship with Tyrrell and Jackie Stewart.

The goal of winning the Le Mans 24 Hours was not achieved until 1972, by which time Elf and Matra had gone their separate ways. Elf, at that time owned by France, then undertook a policy to rebuild and promote French motor racing. began a long-term relationship with Renault, which was also owned by the French government at the time. Renault promoted the use of Elf oils in its road cars, while its Formula One racing cars also carried Elf sponsorship. This changed in 2009, when the Renault Formula One cars replaced the Elf logos with Total logos.

The most famous of the schemes to promote young drivers dates back to the start of the 1970s, when François Guiter of Elf established what was known as the &quot;Volant Elf&quot;. The fastest drivers on each course at the Winfield Racing Schools, Magny Cours and Paul Ricard, were asked to return to the school in the autumn to establish the fastest driver of the year. The two winners were each given a full budget to race the following year in Formula Renault. If they were fast enough they would be retained by Elf in Formula Three and then Formula Two (or later Formula 3000), and eventually they would get a drive in Formula One. The first two &quot;Pilotes Elf&quot; were Patrick Tambay and Didier Pironi. Both went on to win Grands Prix. 
 They were followed over the years by Alain Prost, Pascal Fabre, Olivier Grouillard, Paul Belmondo, Éric Bernard, Érik Comas and Olivier Panis, all of whom became Formula One drivers. In addition, Elf often picked up other good drivers and sponsored them, creating a generation of top French drivers in the 1980s and early 1990s.

When Guiter retired Elf decided to change the policy and a revised program was implemented. This aimed to create a scheme for drivers, mechanics and engineers. Called &quot;La Filière;&quot; it funded as many as eight drivers each year in Formula Renault Elf Campus and four in Formula Three. Budget cuts between 2008 and 2012 reduced the number of French drivers moving on to Formula One positions.

Elf also supplying fuels and lubricants for two Formula One junior feeder open-wheel single-seater formula auto racing tournaments GP2 Series (later rebranded as FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017) since 2005 and GP3 Series since 2010 (later rebranded as FIA Formula 3 Championship in 2019) respectively due to in fact Mecachrome has a long-term technical partnership with Elf since 1969 until 2022.

Elf also supplying standard Ethanol E10 fuels for all SRO-owned GT championships. In 2023, Elf became a series sponsor of the TCR Australia series.

<doc id="285263" wikidata="Q7160526" url="?curid=285263" title="Peg o' My Heart">
<text>&quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; is a popular song written by Alfred Bryan (words) and Fred Fisher (music). It was published on March 15, 1913 and it featured in the 1913 musical &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;.

The song was first performed publicly by Irving Kaufman in 1912 at The College Inn in New York City after he had stumbled across a draft of sheet music on a shelf at the Leo Feist offices. 

The song was inspired by the main character in the very successful Broadway play of the time, &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot;, that debuted December 20, 1912 at the Cort Theatre in NYC. The play was written by J. Hartley Manners and starred Laurette Taylor in the title role. Taylor appeared on the cover of early published sheet music.

==In other media==
&quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; featured in the 1959 film &quot;Oh, You Beautiful Doll&quot;, a fictionalized biography of Fred Fisher, a German-born American writer of Tin Pan Alley songs. (Mark Stevens) turns serious composer Fred Breitenbach (S. Z. Sakall) into songwriter Fred Fisher. Fred Fisher is his assumed name in real life and Breitenbach is his birth surname. In the film, many Fisher songs were given a symphonic arrangement that was performed at Aeolian Hall. Among the other Fisher songs heard were &quot;Chicago,&quot; &quot;Dardanella,&quot; and &quot;Who Paid the Rent for Mrs. Rip Van Winkle&quot;. Mark Stevens (dubbed by Bill Shirley) and June Haver (dubbed by Bonnie Lou Williams) sing &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; as a duet. The film was released on November 11, 1949.

The song, performed by Max Harris and his Novelty Trio (based on the Harmonicats&#x27; 1947 version), was used as the theme of the BBC miniseries &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986). When recording engineer Bill Putnam recorded the Harmonicats&#x27; version of the song, he utilized the bathroom of Universal Recording as an echo chamber and became the first person to use artificial reverberation creatively on a pop recording.

In the 2010 ITV drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, episode 4 season 1 features William, the second footman, playing &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; on the piano in the servants&#x27; hall.

<text>Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham (24 May 1852 – 20 March 1936) was a Scottish politician, writer, journalist and adventurer. He was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP); the first ever socialist member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom; a founder, and the first president, of the Scottish Labour Party; a founder of the National Party of Scotland in 1928; and the first president of the Scottish National Party in 1934.

Cunninghame Graham was the eldest son of Major William Bontine of the Renfrew Militia and formerly a Cornet in the Scots Greys with whom he served in Ireland. His mother was the Hon. Anne Elizabeth Elphinstone-Fleeming, daughter of Admiral Charles Elphinstone-Fleeming of Cumbernauld and a Spanish noblewoman, Doña Catalina Paulina Alessandro de Jiménez, who reputedly, along with her second husband, Admiral James Katon, heavily influenced Cunninghame Graham&#x27;s upbringing. Thus the first language Cunninghame Graham learned was his mother&#x27;s maternal tongue, Spanish.

==Youth==
He spent most of his childhood on the family estate of Finlaystone in Renfrewshire and Ardoch in Dunbartonshire, Scotland, with his younger brothers Charles and Malise.

After being educated at Harrow public school in England, Robert finished his education in Brussels, Belgium, before moving to Argentina to make his fortune cattle ranching. He became known as a great adventurer and gaucho there, and was affectionately known as Don Roberto. He also travelled in Morocco disguised as a Turkish sheikh to find the &quot;forbidden&quot; city of Taroudant but was captured by a Caid (Si Taieb ben Si Ahmed El Hassan El Kintafi), prospected for gold in Spain, befriended Buffalo Bill in Texas, and taught fencing in Mexico City, having travelled there by wagon train from San Antonio de Bexar with his young bride &quot;sic&quot; &quot;Gabrielle Marie de la Balmondiere&quot;, a supposed half-French, half-Chilean poet.

==Convert to socialism==

After the death of his father in 1883 he reverted to the Cunninghame Graham surname. He returned to the UK and became interested in politics. He attended socialist meetings where he heard and met William Morris, George Bernard Shaw, H. M. Hyndman, Keir Hardie and John Burns. Despite his wealthy origins, Graham was converted to socialism and he began to speak at public meetings. He was an impressive orator and was especially good at dealing with hecklers.

==Liberal Party MP==
Although a socialist, in the 1886 general election he stood as a Liberal Party candidate at North West Lanarkshire. His election programme was extremely radical and called for:

*the abolition of the House of Lords
*universal suffrage
*the nationalisation of land, mines and other industries
*free school meals
*disestablishment of the Church of England
*Scottish Home Rule
*the establishment of an eight-hour working day

Supported by liberals and socialists, Graham defeated the Unionist candidate by 322 votes. He had stood against the same candidate at the 1885 general election, in which he was defeated by over 1100 votes.

Robert Cunninghame Graham refused to accept the conventions of the British House of Commons. On 12 September 1887 he was suspended from parliament for making what was called a &quot;disrespectful reference&quot; to the House of Lords. He was the first MP ever to be suspended from the House of Commons for swearing; the word was damn.

Graham&#x27;s main concerns in the House of Commons were the plight of the unemployed and the preservation of civil liberties. He complained about attempts in 1886 and 1887 by the police to prevent public meetings and free speech. He attended the protest demonstration in Trafalgar Square on 13 November 1887 that was broken up by the police and became known as Bloody Sunday. Graham was badly beaten during his arrest and taken to Bow Street Police Station, where his uncle, Col William Hope VC, attempted to post bail. Both Cunninghame Graham, who was defended by H. H. Asquith, and John Burns were found guilty for their involvement in the demonstration and sentenced to six weeks imprisonment.

When Graham was released from Pentonville prison he continued his campaign to improve the rights of working people and to curb their economic exploitation. He was suspended from the House of Commons in December 1888 for protesting about the working conditions of the chain makers of Cradley Heath. His response to the Speaker of the House, &quot;I never withdraw&quot;, was later used by George Bernard Shaw in &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;.

==Scottish independence and the Scottish Labour Party==
Graham was a strong supporter of Scottish independence. In 1886, he helped establish the Scottish Home Rule Association (SHRA), and while in the House of Commons, he made several attempts to persuade fellow MPs of the desirability of a Scottish parliament. On one occasion, Graham joked that he wanted a &quot;national parliament with the pleasure of knowing that the taxes were wasted in Edinburgh instead of London.&quot;

In 1888, Graham attended the SHRA Conference at the Anderton&#x27;s Hotel in Fleet Street and passed a motion &quot;That in the opinion of this Conference the interests of Scotland demand the establishment of a Scotch national Parliament and an Executive Government having control over exclusively Scotch affairs, with a due regard to the integrity of the Empire&quot;. The motion was supported by Mr Cuninghame Graham (as name spelt in article), who said he &quot;wanted a Scotch Parliament to do justice to their crofters and keep them at home, to pass an Eight Hours&#x27; Bill for their miners, to settle the liquor laws, and to nationalise the land.&quot; Peter Esslemont MP attended. Dr G.B Clark Chaired conference MP for Caithness-shire.
While in the House of Commons, Graham became increasingly more radical and went on to found the Scottish Labour Party with Keir Hardie. Graham left the Liberal Party in 1892 to contest the general election in a new constituency as a Labour candidate.

He supported workers in their industrial disputes and was involved with Annie Besant and the Matchgirls Strike and the 1889 Dockers&#x27; Strike. In July 1889, he attended the Marxist Congress of the Second International in Paris with James Keir Hardie, William Morris, Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling. The following year he made a speech in Calais that was considered by the authorities to be so revolutionary that he was arrested and expelled from France.

Graham was a supporter of the eight-hour day and made several attempts to introduce a Bill on the subject. He made some progress with this in the summer of 1892, but he was unable to persuade the Conservative government, headed by Lord Salisbury, to allocate time for the Bill to be fully debated.

At the 1892 general election Graham stood as the Scottish Labour Party candidate for Glasgow Camlachie. He was defeated, bringing his parliamentary career to an end. He remained active in political circles, though, helping his colleague Keir Hardie establish the Independent Labour Party and enter parliament as the MP for West Ham. However, he became disillusioned by the pettiness and dissent of those he called &quot;piss-pot socialists&quot; and increasingly turned to a nascent Scottish nationalism as a means of achieving social justice and cultural revival.

Graham retained a strong belief in Scottish home rule. He played an active part in the establishment of the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in 1928 and was elected the Honorary President of the new Scottish National Party in 1934. He was several times the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association candidate for the Lord Rectorship of the University of Glasgow, which he lost by only sixty-six votes in 1928 to Stanley Baldwin, the Conservative Prime Minister at the time. This event was pivotal in the founding of the National Party, and the eventual creation of the Scottish National Party in the 1930s.

Because of his Scottish nationalism, and criticism of what he saw as the Labour Party&#x27;s timidity and lack of socialist zeal, Graham has been effectively written out of Labour Party history, and the belief has been circulated that after his electoral defeat in 1892, he retired from politics until the late 1920s. This is entirely incorrect; in fact, between 1905 and 1914, Graham, while retaining the position of elder statesman, social commentator, and renowned world-traveller, became more militant, involving himself in many left-wing causes and protests. There is evidence to suggest that he joined the hard-left British Socialist Party, and he was an associate of anarchists and a political assassin. Graham was also a vociferous anti-imperialist at the height of British jingoism as well as a high-profile supporter of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and Home Rule for Ireland and India.

==Author==
Between 1888 and 1892, Graham was a prolific contributor to small-circulation socialist journals, but his literary career took off when he was recruited by Frank Harris to write for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; in 1895, and he continued writing for the &quot;Saturday&quot; until 1926, as well as other journals. His main form was the &#x27;sketch&#x27;, or sketch-tale&#x27;, mostly descriptive, atmospheric works on South America and Scotland, which gave his work a unique aesthetic, which carried a subtext of anti-colonialism, nostalgia, and loss. T. E. Lawrence (of Arabia) described his Scottish sketches as &quot;the rain-in-the-air-and-on-the-roof mournfulness of Scotch music in his time-past style [. . .] snap-shots – the best verbal snapshots ever taken I believe.&quot; His many works were collected into anthologies. Subject matter included history, biography, poetry, essays, politics, travel and seventeen collections of short stories or literary sketches. Titles include &quot;Father Archangel of Scotland&quot; (1896 in conjunction with his wife Gabriela), &quot;Thirteen Stories&quot; (1900), &quot;Success&quot; (1902), &quot;Hope&quot; (1910), &quot;Scottish Stories&quot; (1914), &quot;Brought Forward&quot; (1916) and &quot;Mirages&quot; (1936). Biographies included: &quot;Hernando de Soto&quot; (1903), &quot;Doughty Deeds&quot; (1925), a biography of his great-great-grandfather, Robert Graham of Gartmore and Portrait of a Dictator (1933). His great-niece and biographer, Jean, Lady Polwarth, published a collection of his short stories (or sketches) entitled &quot;Beattock for Moffatt and the Best of Cunninghame Graham&quot; (1979) and Alexander Maitland added his selection under the title &quot;Tales of Horsemen&quot; (1981). Professor John Walker published collections of Cunninghame Graham&#x27;s South American Sketches (1978), Scottish Sketches (1982) and North American Sketches (1986) and Kennedy &amp; Boyd republished the stories and sketches in five volumes (2011 – 2012). In 1988 The Century Travellers reprinted his &quot;Mogreb-el-Acksa&quot; (1898) and &quot;A Vanished Arcadia&quot; (1901). The former was the inspiration for George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;. The latter helped inspire the award-winning film &quot;The Mission&quot;. More recently The Long Riders Guild Press have reprinted his equestrian travel works in their Cunninghame Graham Collection.

He helped his close friend Joseph Conrad, whom he had introduced to his publisher Edward Garnett at Duckworth, with research for his novel &quot;Nostromo&quot;. Other literary friends included Ford Madox Ford, John Galsworthy, W. H. Hudson, George Bernard Shaw (who openly admits his debt to Graham for &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; as well as a key line in &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;) and G. K. Chesterton, who proclaimed him &quot;The Prince of Preface Writers&quot; and famously declared in his autobiography that while Cunninghame Graham would never be allowed to be Prime Minister, he instead &quot;achieved the adventure of being Cunninghame Graham&quot;, which Shaw described as &quot;an achievement so fantastic that it would never be believed in a romance.&quot;

There is a seat dedicated to Cunninghame Graham in the Scottish Storytelling Centre in Edinburgh with the inscription:
&quot;R B &#x27;Don Roberto&#x27; Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore and Ardoch, 1852–1936, A great storyteller&quot;.

== Final years ==

Graham remained sprightly and rode daily even in his eighties. He continued to write, and held the office of President of the Scottish Branch of the P.E.N. Club, and involve himself in politics. He died from pneumonia on 20 March 1936 at the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, following a visit to the birthplace of his friend William Hudson. He lay in state in the Casa del Teatro and received a countrywide tribute led by the President of the Republic before his body was shipped home to be buried beside his wife on 18 April 1936, in the ruined Augustinian Priory on the island of Inchmahome, Lake of Menteith, Stirling.

The following year (June 1937), a monument, the Cunninghame Graham Memorial, was unveiled at Castlehill, Dumbarton, near the family home at Ardoch. Despite the monument being removed to Gartmore in 1981, closer to the principal Graham estate, which he had been forced to sell in 1901 to the shipping magnate and founder of the Clan Line, Sir Charles Cayzer, Bt, the Cunninghame Graham Memorial Park (which is managed by the National Trust for Scotland) is still affectionately locally known as &quot;the Mony&quot;.

His estates at Ardoch and feudal barony of Gartmore passed to his nephew, Captain (later Admiral Sir) Angus Cunninghame Graham, the only son of his brother Cdr. Charles Elphinstone-Fleeming Cunninghame Graham, MVO.

==Cunninghame Graham in art==
Cunninghame Graham was a staunch supporter of the artists of his day and a popular subject. He sat for artists such as Sir William Rothenstein, who painted Don Roberto as &quot;The Fencer&quot;; Sir John Lavery, whose famous &quot;Don Roberto: Commander for the King of Aragon in the Two Sicilies&quot; was on the cover of the Penguin Books edition of Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Nostromo&quot; for many years and who painted the equestrian portrait of Don Roberto on his favourite horse, &quot;Pampa&quot;; and G. P. Jacomb-Hood, who painted his official portrait on entering parliament, with whom, along with Whistler, he was personal friends. George Washington Lambert painted him in oil with his horse Pinto and James McBey portrayed him in old age. There are also busts by Weiss and Jacob Epstein. The Dumbarton born artist, William Strang, used Cunninghame Graham as the model for his series of etchings of Don Quixote. It is unsurprising that he was at the mercy of cartoonists such as Tom Merry, who portrayed him in prison garb, and caricaturists such as Max and Spy.

==Cunninghame Graham as literary inspiration==
Cedric Watts claims that Cunninghame Grahame appears as &#x27;Mr. X&#x27; in Conrad&#x27;s &quot;The Informer&quot;, as &quot;Mr. Courtier&quot; in Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;The Patrician&quot;, and as &#x27;Mr. Graham&#x27; in Wells&#x27;s &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;. Anne Taylor and James Jauncey have argued that his travels in Morocco were one of the inspirations for the character Sandy Arbuthnot, hero of John Buchan&#x27;s novel &quot;Greenmantle&quot; (1916).

<text>Bézier surfaces are a species of mathematical spline used in computer graphics, computer-aided design, and finite element modeling. 
As with Bézier curves, a Bézier surface is defined by a set of control points. Similar to interpolation in many respects, a key difference is that the surface does not, in general, pass through the central control points; rather, it is &quot;stretched&quot; toward them as though each were an attractive force. They are visually intuitive and, for many applications, mathematically convenient.

==History==

Bézier surfaces were first described in 1962 by the French engineer Pierre Bézier who used them to design automobile bodies. Bézier surfaces can be of any degree, but bicubic Bézier surfaces generally provide enough degrees of freedom for most applications.

==Equation==

A given Bézier surface of degree (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) is defined by a set of (&quot;n&quot; + 1)(&quot;m&quot; + 1) control points k&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot; where &quot;i&quot; = 0, ..., &quot;n&quot; and &quot;j&quot; = 0, ..., &quot;m&quot;. It maps the unit square into a smooth-continuous surface embedded within the space containing the k&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot; s – for example, if the k&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot; s are all points in a four-dimensional space, then the surface will be within a four-dimensional space.

A two-dimensional Bézier surface can be defined as a parametric surface where the position of a point p as a function of the parametric coordinates &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; is given by:

:formula_1

evaluated over the unit square, where
:formula_2
is a basis Bernstein polynomial, and 
:formula_3 
is a binomial coefficient.

Some properties of Bézier surfaces:
* A Bézier surface will transform in the same way as its control points under all linear transformations and translations.
* All &quot;u&quot; = constant and &quot;v&quot; = constant lines in the (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) space, and – in particular – all four edges of the deformed (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) unit square are Bézier curves.
* A Bézier surface will lie completely within the convex hull of its control points, and therefore also completely within the bounding box of its control points in any given Cartesian coordinate system.
* The points in the patch corresponding to the corners of the deformed unit square coincide with four of the control points.
* However, a Bézier surface does not generally pass through its other control points.

Generally, the most common use of Bézier surfaces is as nets of bicubic patches (where &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot; = 3). The geometry of a single bicubic patch is thus completely defined by a set of 16 control points. These are typically linked up to form a B-spline surface in a similar way as Bézier curves are linked up to form a B-spline curve.

Simpler Bézier surfaces are formed from biquadratic patches (&quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot; = 2), or Bézier triangles.

==Bézier surfaces in computer graphics==

Bézier patch meshes are superior to triangle meshes as a representation of smooth surfaces. They require fewer points (and thus less memory) to represent curved surfaces, are easier to manipulate, and have much better continuity properties. In addition, other common parametric surfaces such as spheres and cylinders can be well approximated by relatively small numbers of cubic Bézier patches. 

However, Bézier patch meshes are difficult to render directly. One problem with Bézier patches is that calculating their intersections with lines is difficult, making them awkward for pure ray tracing or other direct geometric techniques which do not use subdivision or successive approximation techniques.
They are also difficult to combine directly with perspective projection algorithms.

For this reason, Bézier patch meshes are in general eventually decomposed into meshes of flat triangles by 3D rendering pipelines. In high-quality rendering, the subdivision is adjusted to be so fine that the individual triangle boundaries cannot be seen. To avoid a &quot;blobby&quot; look, fine detail is usually applied to Bézier surfaces at this stage using texture maps, bump maps and other pixel shader techniques.
A Bézier patch of degree (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) may be constructed out of two Bézier triangles of degree &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot;, or out of a single Bézier triangle of degree &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot;, with the input domain as a square instead of a triangle.

A Bézier triangle of degree &quot;m&quot; may also be constructed out of a Bézier surface of degree (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), with the control points so that one edge is squashed to a point, or with the input domain as a triangle instead of a square.

<text>Mildred Bailey (born Mildred Rinker; February 27, 1907 – December 12, 1951) was a Native American jazz singer during the 1930s, known as &quot;The Queen of Swing&quot;, &quot;The Rockin&#x27; Chair Lady&quot;, and &quot;Mrs. Swing&quot;. 

She recorded the songs &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s So Peaceful in the Country&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; The Uptown Lowdown&quot;, &quot;Trust in Me&quot;, &quot;Where Are You?&quot;, &quot;I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Small Fry&quot;, &quot;Please Be Kind&quot;, &quot;Darn That Dream&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;, &quot;Blame It on My Last Affair&quot;, and &quot;Says My Heart&quot;. She had three records that reached number one on the popular charts.

Bailey grew up on the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation in Idaho, where her mother was an enrolled citizen. The family moved to Spokane, Washington, when she was 13. Her younger brothers also became musicians. Her brother, Al Rinker, started to perform as a singer with Bing Crosby in Spokane and became a member of The Rhythm Boys. As adults, Charles Rinker was a lyricist, and Miles Rinker was a clarinet and saxophone player who later became a booking agent.

==Early life==
Bailey was born Mildred Rinker on a farm in rural Tekoa, Washington. Her mother Josephine was a citizen of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe and a devout Roman Catholic. Bailey&#x27;s great-grandfather, Bazil Peone, was a head speaker and song leader of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene at the turn of the 20th century. His ability to create indigenized Catholic hymns helped guide the tribe during difficult times of active colonization by Jesuit missionaries.

Bailey and her siblings grew up near De Smet, Idaho, on the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation. Her father played fiddle and called square dances. Her mother played piano every evening and taught her to play and sing. Her younger brothers included Miles, Al, a vocalist and composer, and Charles, a lyricist. The family often hosted Saturday night gatherings, creating small music and dance hall in the home for local ranchers with both Josephine and Mildred at the piano. Mildred also accompanied her mother to traditional native ceremonies, where she heard and practiced the traditional songs and lyrics that would later influence her unique singing voice.

Josephine died from tuberculosis at the age of 36, threatening Mildred&#x27;s ability to remain connected to her native family and traditions in a way that she was able to while her mother was alive. Soon after Josephine&#x27;s death, Mildred&#x27;s father remarried, bringing a daughter and creating a tumultuous and unhappy house from which Mildred and her siblings were systematically pushed out by her new stepmother. Given an ultimatum to choose his own children or his new wife, Mildred&#x27;s father sided with his wife and Mildred moved out of the home and in with her aunt and uncle in Seattle. She and her aunt were involved in a serious car accident a short time later which killed her aunt and left Mildred with serious physical and emotional scars.

==Music career==
At age 17, Rinker moved to Seattle and worked as a sheet music demonstrator at Woolworth&#x27;s. She married and divorced Ted Bailey, keeping his last name because she thought it sounded more American than Rinker, which was of Swiss (German) origin.

She toured with a West Coast revue and finished in California where she obtained work at radio station KMTR and at a speakeasy in Bakersfield called The Swede&#x27;s. With the help of her second husband Benny Stafford, Bailey became an established blues and jazz singer on the west coast of the United States. According to Gary Giddins in his book &quot;Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams, The Early Years 1903–1940&quot;, she found work for her brother Al Rinker and Bing Crosby, who had started performing in Spokane, Washington. They had traveled from Spokane to join her in Los Angeles. Giddins says Crosby heard about Louis Armstrong from Bailey, who urged him to hear Armstrong if Crosby was to be a serious jazz singer. She also played Crosby records from her collection by Ethel Waters and Bessie Smith.

Crosby helped Bailey in turn by introducing her to Paul Whiteman in Los Angeles. She sang with Whiteman&#x27;s band from 1929 to 1933. Whiteman had a radio program for Old Gold Cigarettes, and when Bailey debuted on it with her version of &quot;Moanin&#x27; Low&quot; on August 6, 1929, favorable public reaction was immediate. However, Bailey&#x27;s first recording with Whiteman did not take place until October 6, 1931, when she recorded a song called &quot;My Goodbye to You&quot;. Her recording of &quot;All of Me&quot; with Whiteman the same year was a hit in 1932.

Her first two records had been as an uncredited vocalist for a 1929 session by the Eddie Lang Orchestra (&quot;What Kind o&#x27; Man Is You?&quot;, a Hoagy Carmichael song that was issued only in the UK), and a recording on May 8, 1930, of &quot;I Like to Do Things for You&quot; for Frankie Trumbauer. She was Whiteman&#x27;s female vocalist through 1932 (recording in a smooth, crooning style) but left the band later that same year over salary disagreements. She recorded four sides for Brunswick in 1931 with the Casa Loma Orchestra. and there were further recordings for the label in 1933 with the Dorsey Brothers as supporting musicians. Bailey was part of an all-star session with Benny Goodman&#x27;s studio band in 1934 featuring Coleman Hawkins, Dick McDonough, and Gene Krupa. After leaving Whiteman, Bailey sang on the radio shows of George Jessel and Willard Robison.

In 1933, Bailey married Red Norvo, a xylophonist, improviser, and band leader who had also worked with Paul Whiteman. A dynamic couple, they remained married until 1942 and were known as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Swing&quot;. They worked much of the time in New York City. They remained friends after their divorce. She worked as a solo act, singing in clubs in New York, such as the Café Society and the Blue Angel. From September 1944, Bailey&#x27;s radio show began on CBS and continued until February 1945. Her last major engagement was with Joe Marsala in Chicago in 1950.

From 1936 to 1939, Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist), and Bailey recorded for Vocalion, often with Norvo&#x27;s band. Some of her other recordings featured members of Count Basie&#x27;s band. The two performers continued to record together intermittently until 1945. Bailey was featured on Benny Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Camel Caravan&quot; radio program and sang on a number of Goodman&#x27;s Columbia recordings in 1939 and 1940, including her version of &quot;Darn That Dream&quot; which was a hit in 1940.

Bailey suffered from diabetes. Due to her health, she was hospitalized in 1938, 1943, and 1949. She went into retirement for a time in 1949 on a farm she owned in Poughkeepsie, New York. Often in financial difficulties, she was bailed out several times by Bing Crosby.

Bailey died of heart failure on December 12, 1951 in St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, New York at the age of 44.

==Awards and honors==
* In 1989, Bailey was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.
* &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz&quot; describes Bailey as &quot;the first white singer to absorb and master the jazz-flavored phrasing...of her black contemporaries.&quot; However, this designation fails to recognize Bailey&#x27;s full heritage, as her mother was &quot;a Coeur d’Alene tribal member,&quot; and &quot;her father of Swiss-Irish stock.&quot; 
* In 1994, a 29-cent stamp was issued by the US Postal Service in Bailey&#x27;s honor; it was designed by Howard Koslow, based on the photograph by jazz photographer William Gottlieb (at the head of this article) of Bailey performing at Carnegie Hall.
* In 2012, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Nation introduced a resolution honoring Bailey to the Idaho state legislature. They were seeking acknowledgement of the singer&#x27;s Coeur d&#x27;Alene ancestry as well as to promote her induction to the Jazz at Lincoln Center Hall of Fame in New York City.

==Number one hits==
In 1938, Bailey had two number one hits with Red Norvo and His Orchestra. &quot;Please Be Kind&quot; reached number one on the Hit Parade chart on May 7. She also sang lead vocals with Norvo on &quot;Says My Heart&quot;, which reached number one during the week of June 18, 1938.

Bailey sang lead vocals on &quot;Darn That Dream&quot;, recorded by Benny Goodman and His Orchestra, which reached number one for one week in March 1940 on the U.S. pop chart.

<text>Altrincham ( , locally ) is a market town in Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, south of the River Mersey. It is southwest of Manchester, southwest of Sale and east of Warrington. At the 2021 census, the built up area had a population of 49,680.

It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. Altrincham developed as a market town following the right to hold a market being granted in 1290; the market continues today. Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham&#x27;s subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park.

Altrincham has good transport links to Manchester, Sale, Stretford and Stockport among other destinations. The town has a strong middle-class presence: there has been a steady increase in Altrincham&#x27;s middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home to Altrincham F.C. and three ice hockey clubs: Manchester Storm, Altrincham Aces and Trafford Tornados.

==History==
Local evidence of prehistoric human activity exists in the form of two Neolithic arrowheads found in Altrincham, and, further afield, a concentration of artefacts around Dunham. The remains of a Roman road, part of one of the major Roman roads in North West England connecting the legionary fortresses of Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), run through the Broadheath area. As it shows signs of having been repaired, the road was in use for a considerable period of time. The name Altrincham first appears as &quot;Aldringeham&quot;, probably meaning &quot;homestead of Aldhere&#x27;s people&quot;. As recently as the 19th century it was spelt both Altrincham and Altringham.
Until the Normans invaded England, the manors surrounding Altrincham were owned by the Saxon thegn Alweard; after the invasion they became the property of Hamon de Massey, though Altrincham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The earliest documented reference to the town is from 1290, when it was granted its charter as a &#x27;free borough&#x27; by Baron Hamon de Massey V. The charter, which still exists and is held by Trafford Council, allowed a weekly market to be held, and it is possible that de Massey established the town to generate income through taxes on trade and tolls. Altrincham was probably chosen as the site of the planned town rather than Dunham – which would have been protected by Dunham Castle – because its good access to roads was important for trade.

Altrincham Fair became St James&#x27;s Fair or Samjam in 1319 and continued until 1895. Fair days had their own court of Pye Powder (a corruption of the French for &quot;dusty feet&quot;), presided over by the mayor and held to settle disputes arising from the day&#x27;s dealings. By 1348 the town had 120 burgage plots – ownership of land used as a measure of status and importance in an area – putting it on a par with the Cheshire town of Macclesfield and above Stockport and Knutsford. The earliest known residence in Altrincham was &quot;the Knoll&quot;, on Stamford Street near the centre of the medieval town. A 1983 excavation on the demolished building, made by South Trafford Archaeological Group, discovered evidence that the house dated from the 13th or 14th century, and that it may have contained a drying kiln or malting floor. During the English Civil War, men from Altrincham fought for the Parliamentarian Sir George Booth. During the war, armies camped on nearby Bowdon Downs on several occasions.

In 1754, a stretch of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed passengers for the maintenance of the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of market gardening, and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, the first step in the development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham&#x27;s industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.

Moves to connect the town to the UK&#x27;s railway network gained pace in 1845, when the Act of Parliament for the construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) was passed. The first train left Altrincham early on 20 July 1849, carrying 65 passengers. The MSJAR had two stations in the town: Altrincham, on Stockport Road, and Bowdon – though not actually in Bowdon – on Lloyd Street/Railway Street. Both were replaced in 1881 by Altrincham &amp; Bowdon railway station on Stamford New Road. The London and North Western Railway&#x27;s station at Broadheath, on the town&#x27;s northern edge, was opened in 1854, while a further connection was created on 12 May 1862 by the Cheshire Midland Railway (later the Cheshire Lines Committee), who opened their line from Altrincham to Knutsford.

With its new railway links, Altrincham and the surrounding areas became desirable places for the middle classes and commuters to live. Professionals and industrialists moved to the town, commuting into Manchester. While some travelled daily by coach, the less well–to–do commuted by express or &quot;flyer&quot; barges from Broadheath. Between 1851 and 1881 the population increased from 4,488 to 11,250. Broadheath&#x27;s industrial area, covering about , was founded in 1885 by Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford, to attract businesses. By 1900 Broadheath had its own docks, warehouses and electricity generating station. The site&#x27;s proximity to rail, canal and road links proved attractive to companies making machine tools, cameras and grinding machines. The presence of companies like Tilghmans Sand Blast, and the Linotype and Machinery Company, established Broadheath as an industrial area of national standing. By 1914, 14 companies operated in Broadheath, employing thousands of workers. One of those was the Budenberg Gauge Company. Linotype also created 172 workers&#x27; homes near its factory, helping cater for the population boom created by Broadheath&#x27;s industrialisation. Between 1891 and 1901 the population of Altrincham increased by 35 per cent, from 12,440 to 16,831.

From the turn of the 20th century to the start of the Second World War, there were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s raids on the Manchester area in the latter war, it emerged from the war relatively unscathed having lost only 23 civilian residents through enemy action, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40 per cent.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Altrincham, at metropolitan borough level: Trafford Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester.

===Administrative history===
Altrincham was historically a township in the ancient parish of Bowdon, which formed part of the Bucklow Hundred of Cheshire.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Bowdon, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Altrincham became a civil parish. In ecclesiastical terms, Altrincham became a chapelry in 1799 after St George&#x27;s Church was built as a chapel of ease to St Mary&#x27;s, Bowdon. Altrincham subsequently became its own ecclesiastical parish separate from Bowdon in 1860.

Altrincham was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de MasseyV. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants&#x27; guild, run by the town&#x27;s burgesses, to tax people passing through the borough and to regulate the market. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a court leet and elected a mayor from at least 1452. Amongst the court&#x27;s responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs. Although described as a &#x27;free borough&#x27;, a government survey of boroughs in 1835 found that in practice the town was a seigneurial borough, remaining subservient to the lord of the manor, with the borough authorities having very few functions. The borough was therefore left unreformed when the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed most ancient boroughs across the country into municipal boroughs.
As such, the old borough authorities continued to exist with the few functions they had, but were ineligible to take on any new powers. A new town hall was built on Church Street in 1849, commissioned by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford, as lord of the manor, for holding the court leet and other public meetings. It replaced an earlier town hall which had stood in the middle of Old Market Place. In order to provide more modern local government functions, the Altrincham township was made a local board district in 1851, administered by an elected local board with powers including the provision of sewers and water supply, overseeing public health, and other functions. From 1851 to 1886, the old borough and its officers existed alongside the local board. In 1886, the old borough was finally abolished. In recognition of the fact that Altrincham&#x27;s mayor had been a purely honorary position for many years, the court leet was allowed to continue to appoint an honorary mayor, but with no powers or jurisdiction.

Local board districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. A new Altrincham Town Hall on Market Street was commissioned for the urban district council. It was designed by Charles Albert Hindle and was completed in November 1901. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey civil parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936 when Timperley civil parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham Urban District. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey civil parish was added. In 1937 the Altrincham Urban District was incorporated to become a municipal borough. The new borough was granted a coat of arms which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford.

The Municipal Borough of Altrincham was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester.

For parliamentary representation, an Altrincham constituency was created in 1885. It was replaced by the Altrincham and Sale constituency in 1945. In 1997, this in turn became part of the newly created constituency of Altrincham and Sale West. Since 2024, Altrincham and Sale West has been represented in the House of Commons by the Labour MP, Connor Rand.

==Geography==
At (53.3838, −2.3547), Altrincham is on the southwestern edge of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, immediately south of the town of Sale, and southwest of Manchester city centre. It lies in the northwest corner of the Cheshire Plain, just south of the River Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal passes through the Broadheath area of the town. Altrincham&#x27;s drinking water is supplied by United Utilities. The local bedrock consists mainly of Keuper Waterstone, a type of sandstone, and water retrieved from those rocks is very hard and often saline, making it undrinkable. The town&#x27;s climate is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom; whereas both annual rainfall and average hours of sunshine are slightly below the average for the UK.

Along with Sale, Stretford and Urmston, Altrincham is one of the four major urban areas in Trafford. The Altrincham area, as defined by Trafford Council, comprises the south of Trafford. In addition to the town of Altrincham, it includes the villages of Timperley, Bowdon, Hale and Hale Barns. The Broadheath area of the town was a light industrial centre until the 1970s and is now a retail park. The most densely populated part of the town is around the town centre, with the less populated areas and more green space further from the centre of town in villages such as Bowdon and Hale. The Oldfield Brow area lies on the outskirts of the town beside the Bridgewater Canal and close to Dunham Massey.

==Demography==

As of the 2011 UK census, the town of Altrincham had a total population of 52,419. Of its 41,530 residents aged 16 and over, 62.1 per cent were couples living together.
The town&#x27;s population density is 37.4 inhabitants per hectare, with the population consisting of 49.0% males and 51.0% females. Of those aged 16 and over, 15.2 per cent had no academic qualifications, similar to the 18.6 per cent in all of Trafford. At 8.4 percent, Altrincham has a low proportion of non-white people. Asians are the area&#x27;s largest ethnic minority, at 4.9 per cent of the population.

In 1931, 14.6 per cent of Altrincham&#x27;s population was middle class, slightly higher than the figure for England and Wales, which was 14 per cent. By 1971 this gap had increased to 28.8 per cent compared to 24 per cent nationally, while the town&#x27;s working class population had declined, from 30.3 per cent in 1931 (36 per cent in England and Wales) to 18.6 per cent (26 per cent nationwide). The remainder comprised clerical and skilled manual workers. This change in social structure was similar to that seen across the nation – although biased towards the middle classes – making Altrincham the middle-class town it is today.

===Population change===
According to the hearth tax returns from 1664, the township of Altrincham had a population of about 636, making it the largest of the local settlements; this had increased to 1,692 in 1801. In the first half of the 19th century, the town&#x27;s population increased by 165 per cent, higher than 89 per cent across England and 98 per cent in the Trafford area. The growth of the settlement was a result of the Industrial Revolution, and although Altrincham was one of the fastest-growing townships in the Trafford area, but paled in comparison to new industrial areas such as Ashton-under-Lyne, Hyde, and Manchester. In the second half of the 19th century, Altrincham&#x27;s population grew by 275 per cent, higher than the 235 per cent for Trafford and 69 per cent nationally in the same period. This was due to the late industrialisation of the area and the introduction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849.


==Economy==

Historically, Altrincham was a market town and the two main areas of employment were agriculture and market trade. Although the town went into decline in the 15th century, it recovered and the annual fairs lasted until the mid-19th century and the market still continues. During the Industrial Revolution, Altrincham grew as an industrial town, particularly the Broadheath area, which was developed into an industrial estate. In 1801 there were four cotton mills in Altrincham, although they had closed by the 1851 census. The decline of the textile industry in Altrincham mirrored the decline of the industry in the Trafford area as a result of a lack of investment and the development of more established industrial areas such as Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Oldham. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, heavier industries moved into Broadheath, providing local employment. The area steadily declined during the second half of the 20th century, with employment at Broadheath falling from 8,000 to 5,000 between 1960 and 1970. Despite the presence of retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Marks &amp; Spencer in the town, a new Asda superstore in Broadheath, and redevelopment schemes costing over £100 million, Altrincham&#x27;s 15.5 per cent level of employment in retail is below the national average of 16.9 per cent. Altrincham, with its neighbours Bowdon and Hale, is said to constitute a &quot;stockbroker belt&quot;, with well-appointed dwellings in an area of opulence.

The historic market town developed as a residential area in the 19th century although it retains its retail heritage in the Old Market Place (a conservation area) and a new pedestrianised shopping centre. The retail districts of the town have more recently fallen victim to decline due to competition from the nearby Trafford Centre and a regenerated Manchester city centre. In 2006 Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council unveiled plans for a £1.5 million redevelopment for the town centre. The renovation will create of new retail space and of refurbished space, providing in total.

Construction on Altair, a £100 million development on Oakfield Road, began in September 2019 after many years of delay. The scheme includes apartments, shops and eating places and will create a new public square linking it to the nearby Altrincham Interchange, which underwent a £19million refurbishment in 2015. A 2010 survey found that despite being in one of the country&#x27;s most affluent areas, nearly a third of the shops in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) to the effects of the recession and plans to refurbish Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.

According to the 2011 UK census, the main industries of employment of residents in Altrincham were wholesale and retail trade (14.8%), human health and social work activities (13.0%), and professional, scientific and technical activities (11.6%). The census recorded the economic inactivity of residents aged 16–74 as 3.5 per cent looking after home or family, 2.8 per cent long-term sick or disabled, 4.1 per cent students, and 1.5 per cent economically inactive for other reasons. The 3.1 per cent unemployment rate of Altrincham was low compared with the national rate of 4.4 per cent.

===Landmarks and attractions===

The Old Market Place is thought to stand on the site of the original town settlement. Now a registered conservation area it consists of a series of part timber-framed buildings echoing the wattle and daube constructions of the original houses and burgage plots. The cobblestone paving was replaced in 1896. The Buttermarket which stood in the area near the Old Market Place from the 17th century until the late 19th century was also the site for dispensing early local justice. A courtroom, stocks and whipping post saw public floggings take place there until the early 19th century. The whipping post and stocks were restored as a tourist attraction by local traders in the 1990s. However, the Buttermarket area was also a site of religious importance, since prospective brides and grooms are thought to have declared their intentions here. In 1814 Thomas de Quincey described the Old Market Place in his &quot;Confessions of an English Opium Eater&quot; while travelling from Manchester to Chester. He noted how little the place had changed since his visit 14 years earlier at the age of three, and that &quot;fruits, such as can be had in July, and flowers were scattered about in profusion: even the stalls of the butchers, from their brilliant cleanliness, appeared attractive: and bonny young women of Altrincham were all tripping about in caps and aprons coquettishly disposed&quot; In 1974 Altrincham artist George Allen was approached by Trafford Council to paint a picture of The Old Market Place. This picture was used to produce postcards which were sold to promote Altrincham, and are still sold today to raise funds for a local charity.
Another of Altrincham&#x27;s attractions is the historic market, set up over 700 years ago when the town was first established.
Of the 21 conservation areas in Trafford, ten are in Altrincham: The Downs, The Devisdale, Bowdon, Ashley Heath, Goose Green, Old Market Place, Sandiway, George Street, the Linotype Housing Estate and Stamford New Road. On the town&#x27;s outskirts is the 18th-century Dunham Massey Hall, surrounded by its deer park, both now owned by the National Trust. The hall is early Georgian in style, and along with its stables and carriage house, is a Grade I listed building.

Royd House was built between 1914 and 1916, by local architect Edgar Wood, as his own residence. It has a flat concrete roof, a concave façade, and is faced in Portland red stone and Lancashire brick. It is regarded as one of the most advanced examples of early 20th-century domestic architecture, and is referenced in architectural digests. It has been a Grade I listed building since 1975, one of six such buildings in Trafford. The Grade II listed clock outside the main transport interchange was built in 1880.

The Stamford Park was designed by landscape gardener John Shaw. It opened to the public in 1880, as a sports park with areas for cricket and football. The land was donated by George Grey, the 7th Earl of Stamford, and is now owned and run by Trafford Council. The park is listed as Grade II on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England, and has won a bronze award from the Greenspace award scheme.

John Leigh Park, located in the area of Oldfield Brow, was the site of Oldfield Hall until 1917 when it fell into disrepair after being purchased by the Earl of Stamford. That year Mr John Leigh purchased the land from the widowed Countess of Stamford and gifted it to the local council to be used as a park for soldiers and workers. The park was named &#x27;John Leigh Park&#x27; and opened on 22 July 1917.

===Events and venues===

Altrincham has its own annual festival that has taken place for over 40 years (except during Covid). The event takes place at the end of June/Early July. The festival, which is entirely self funded and arranged by volunteers, consists of a Parade through the town and culminates in a 2-day music and family event at Beechfields. The family event consists of a stage showcasing local music and culture, together with a fun fair, food village and community stalls. The event is the largest free family event in the Borough of Trafford.
Altrincham has two theatres, the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse and the Club Theatre (latterly known as the Altrincham Little Theatre). The Altrincham Garrick group was formed in 1913. The Garrick held the world stage premiere of &quot;Psycho&quot; in 1982. In 1998, it received a grant of £675,000 from the National Lottery as part of a £900,000 redevelopment of the theatre, which was completed in 1999. The Club Theatre group began in 1896, as the St Margaret&#x27;s Church Institute Amateur Dramatics Society. It provides a venue for the Trafford Youth Theatre production each year, and it runs the Hale One Act Festival, an annual week-long event started in 1972. The club has received awards from both the Greater Manchester Drama Federation and the Cheshire Theatre Guild. Altrincham also had Greater Manchester&#x27;s only Michelin starred restaurant, the Juniper.

===Sport===
Altrincham F.C., nicknamed &quot;The Robins&quot;, was founded in 1903 and play home matches at Moss Lane. The club plays in the National League. In the 1970s and 1980s, Altrincham F.C. built a reputation for &quot;&quot; acts against Football League teams in FA Cup matches. The club has knocked out Football League opposition on a record 16 occasions, including a 1986 victory against top-flight Birmingham City. Altrincham won the forerunner of the Football Conference in its first two seasons, but was denied election to the Football League on both occasions, falling a single vote short in 1980. Altrincham have since had mixed fortunes. Relegated to the Northern Premier League in 1997, the club has since earned 5 promotions and suffered 5 relegations, most recently gaining promotion to the National League in the 2019-20 season. The club&#x27;s main rivals are Macclesfield Town and Northwich Victoria.
Altrincham is one of the few towns in north-west England with an ice rink and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham Ice Rink was built in Broadheath. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham Ice Rink closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until construction of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham Ice Dome was completed. Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the Ice Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester&#x27;s MEN Arena. In 2009, the Manchester Phoenix English National Ice Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team&#x27;s name back into use. When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to the public for ice skating.

Founded in 1897, Altrincham Kersal RUFC plays rugby union. They have played at level 6 since being relegated from North One in 2012. Following the withdrawal of a number of Lancashire clubs from the county&#x27;s union, they have been level transferred to play in the North Lancashire and Cumbria League for 2018–19. The club has produced England and Sale Sharks players Mark Cueto and Chris Jones and continues to produce players for the Sale Jets.

Altrincham and District Athletics Club was founded in 1961 and provides training facilities for track and field, road running, cross-country running and fell running.

Seamons Cycling Club was formed in 1948 in the area of Altrincham known locally as Seamons Moss.

==Education==

As Altrincham was part of the Bowdon parish, children from the township may have gone to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system. A salt merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40 boys aged 8–11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Altrincham&#x27;s increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9 schools, 1 college, and 23 teachers. The introduction of compulsory education during the second half of the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12 church schools and 8 private schools.

Responsibility for local education fell to Cheshire County Council in 1903. Loreto Convent, the County High School for Girls, and Altrincham County High School for Boys, were founded in 1909, 1910, and 1912 respectively. Although still open these schools have since changed their names to Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, and Loreto Grammar School. Altrincham received evacuees during the Second World War, and it was in this period that St. Ambrose College was founded.

Altrincham now has eighteen primary schools, one special school and eight secondary schools, including five grammar schools; the Trafford district maintains a selective education system assessed by entrance exams set by each school. Several of Altrincham&#x27;s secondary schools have specialist status: Altrincham College (arts); Altrincham Grammar School for Boys (language); Altrincham Grammar School for Girls (language); Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College (maths and computing); Loreto Grammar School (science and maths); and St. Ambrose College (maths and computing). Altrincham College of Arts, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College, Loreto Grammar School and St. Ambrose College were all rated as outstanding in 2011–12 Ofsted reports. Brentwood Special School is a mixed school for 11- to 19-year-olds who have special needs or learning difficulties.

Altrincham is home to one of the longest established, family-owned nursery schools in the UK, Oakfield Nursery School. Oakfield was voted &#x27;UK Nursery of the Year&#x27; in 2014 and &#x27;Best Individual Nursery&#x27; in 2008.

==Religion==
During the medieval and post-medieval periods the township of Altrincham was part of Bowdon parish. Low population density meant that the town did not have a church until the Anglican church established a chapel of ease in 1799. Nonconformists were also present in Altrincham; Methodists set up a chapel in 1790, and Baptists built one in the 1870s. Irish immigrants in the 1830s and 1840s also returned Roman Catholicism to the area, the first Roman Catholic church built in Altrincham being St Vincent&#x27;s, in 1860.

Several churches in Altrincham are deemed architecturally important enough to be designated Grade II listed buildings. These are Christ Church, the Church of St Alban, the Church of St George, the Church of St John the Evangelist and Trinity United Reformed Church. Of the nine Grade II* listed buildings in Trafford, three are in Altrincham: the Church of St Margaret, the Church of St John the Divine and Hale Chapel in Hale Barns. As of the 2001 UK census, 78.8 per cent of Altrincham&#x27;s residents reported themselves as being Christian, 1.1 per cent Jewish, 1.1 per cent Muslim, 0.4 per cent Hindu, 0.2 per cent Buddhist and 0.1 per cent Sikh. The census recorded 12.1 per cent as having no religion, 0.2 per cent with an alternative religion, while 6.1 per cent did not state a religion. Altrincham is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury, and the Church of England Diocese of Chester. The nearest synagogue, belonging to Hale and District Hebrew Congregation, is on Shay Lane in Hale Barns.

==Transport==

Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931, it became one of Great Britain&#x27;s first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time, a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm, to Warrington.

Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink&#x27;s termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16) and now includes a brand new footbridge, with three lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger-scale ticket office and a modern bus interchange. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury; the service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester (via Northwich) and with Manchester (via Stockport). Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is to the south-east of the town and is connected via the Manchester Piccadilly–Crewe line. There are plans to create a new link between Manchester Airport and the Mid-Cheshire Line, which Altrincham Interchange is a station on. Recently the Metrolink completed connections to this airport and opened the line 12 months early, but this is not a direct connection from the Metrolink line at Altrincham Interchange.

<text>Dame Florence Marjorie Wilcox (&quot;née&quot; Robertson; 20 October 1904 – 3 June 1986), known professionally as Anna Neagle, was an English stage and film actress, singer, and dancer.

She was a successful box-office draw in British cinema for 20 years and was voted the most popular star in Britain in 1949. She was known for providing glamour and sophistication to war-torn London audiences with her lightweight musicals, comedies, and historical dramas. Almost all of her films were produced and directed by Herbert Wilcox, whom she married in 1943.

In her historical dramas, Neagle was renowned for her portrayals of British historical figures, including Nell Gwyn (&quot;Nell Gwyn&quot;, 1934), Queen Victoria (&quot;Victoria the Great&quot;, 1937 and &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot;, 1938), Edith Cavell (&quot;Nurse Edith Cavell&quot;, 1939), and Florence Nightingale (&quot;The Lady with a Lamp&quot;, 1951).

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Florence Marjorie Robertson was born in Forest Gate, Essex, the daughter of Merchant Navy captain Herbert William Robertson and Florence, née Neagle. Her elder brother was the bass-baritone and actor Stuart Robertson (1901–1958). She made her stage debut as a dancer in 1917, and later appeared in the chorus of C.B. Cochran&#x27;s revues and also André Charlot&#x27;s revue &quot;Bubbly&quot;. While with Cochran, she understudied Jessie Matthews.

In 1931, she starred in the West End musical &quot;Stand Up and Sing&quot; with actor Jack Buchanan, who encouraged her to take a featured role. For this play, she began using the professional name Anna Neagle (the surname being her mother&#x27;s maiden name). The play was a success with a total run of 604 performances. &quot;Stand Up and Sing&quot; provided her big break when film producer and director Herbert Wilcox caught the show to consider Buchanan for an upcoming film, but also took note of her cinematic potential.

=== Cinematic beginnings ===

Forming a professional alliance with Wilcox, Neagle played her first starring film role in the musical &quot;Goodnight, Vienna&quot; (1932), again with Jack Buchanan. With this film, Neagle became an overnight favourite. Although the film cost a mere £23,000 to produce, it was a hit at the box office, with profits from its Australian release alone being £150,000.

After her starring role in &quot;The Flag Lieutenant&quot; (also 1932), directed by and co-starring Henry Edwards, she worked exclusively under Wilcox&#x27;s direction for all but one of her subsequent films, becoming one of Britain&#x27;s biggest stars.

She continued in the musical genre, co-starring with Fernand Gravey (later known as Fernand Gravet) in &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; (1933). This first version of Noël Coward&#x27;s tale of ill-fated lovers was later obscured by the better-known Jeanette MacDonald–Nelson Eddy remake in 1940.

Neagle had her first major success with &quot;Nell Gwyn&quot; (1934), which Wilcox had previously shot as a silent starring Dorothy Gish in 1926. Neagle&#x27;s performance as Gwyn, who became the mistress of Charles II (played by Cedric Hardwicke) prompted some censorship in the United States. The Hays Office had Wilcox add an (historically false) scene featuring the two leads getting married and also a &quot;framing&quot; story resulting in an entirely different ending. Graham Greene, then a film critic, said of &quot;Nell Gwyn&quot;: &quot;I have seen few things more attractive than Miss Neagle in breeches&quot;.

Two years after &quot;Nell Gwyn&quot;, she followed up with another real-life figure, portraying Irish actress Peg Woffington in &quot;Peg of Old Drury&quot; (1936). That same year, she appeared in &quot;Limelight&quot;, a backstage film musical in which she played a chorus girl. Her co-star was Arthur Tracy, who had gained fame in the United States as a radio performer known as the Street Singer. The film also featured Jack Buchanan in an uncredited cameo. performing &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot;.

Neagle and Wilcox followed with a circus trapeze fable &quot;Three Maxims&quot; (1937), which was released in the United States as &quot;The Show Goes On&quot;. The film, with a script featuring a contribution from Herman J. Mankiewicz (later to co-write &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; with Orson Welles), had Neagle performing her own high-wire acrobatics. Although now highly successful in films, Neagle continued acting on the stage. In 1934, while working under director Robert Atkins, she performed as Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; and Olivia in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Both productions earned her critical accolades, despite the fact that she had never performed Shakespearean roles before.

In 1937, Neagle gave her most prestigious performance so far – as Queen Victoria in the historical drama &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; (1937), co-starring Anton Walbrook as Prince Albert. The script by Robert Vansittart and Miles Malleson (from Laurence Housman&#x27;s play &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;) alternated between the political and the personal lives of the royal couple. The Diamond Jubilee sequence that climaxed the film was shot in Technicolor. &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; was such an international success that it resulted in Neagle and Walbrook playing their roles again in an all-Technicolor sequel entitled &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot; (1938), co-starring C. Aubrey Smith as the Duke of Wellington. While the first of these films was in release, Neagle returned to the London stage and entertained audiences with her portrayal of the title role in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

=== An American Excursion ===

The success of &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; and &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot; caused Hollywood studios to take notice. Neagle and Wilcox began an association with RKO Radio Pictures. Their first American film was &quot;Nurse Edith Cavell&quot; (1939), a remake of &quot;Dawn&quot;, a Wilcox silent that starred Sybil Thorndike. In this, another Neagle role based on an actual British heroine, she played the role of the nurse who was shot by the Germans in World War I, for allegedly aiding Allied PoWs to escape and for spying. The resulting effort had a significant impact for audiences on the eve of the WWII.

In a turnabout from this serious drama, the couple followed with three musical comedies, all based on once-popular stage plays. The first of these was &quot;Irene&quot; (1940), co-starring Ray Milland. It included a Technicolor sequence, which featured Neagle singing the play&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;Alice Blue Gown&quot;. She followed this film with &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; (1940) with Victor Mature, in which she sang &quot;Tea For Two&quot;, and &quot;Sunny&quot; (1941), with Ray Bolger.

Neagle and Wilcox&#x27;s final American film was &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943), a tale of a London family house from 1804 to the 1940 blitz. This film boasts 80 performers (mostly expatriate British), including Ray Milland, C. Aubrey Smith, Claude Rains, Charles Laughton, and – among the few North Americans – Buster Keaton. Wilcox directed the sequence featuring Neagle, Milland, Smith, and Rains, while other directors who worked on the film included René Clair, Edmund Goulding, Frank Lloyd, Victor Saville, and Robert Stevenson. During the war, the profits and salaries were given to war relief. After the war, prints were intended to be destroyed, so that no one could profit from them, but this never occurred.

=== Return to the UK ===

Returning to the UK, Neagle and Wilcox commenced with &quot;They Flew Alone&quot; (1942; shot after but released before &quot;Forever and a Day&quot;). Neagle this time played aviator Amy Johnson, who had recently died in a flying accident. Robert Newton co-starred as Johnson&#x27;s husband, Jim Mollison. The film intercut the action with newsreel footage.

Neagle and Wilcox married in August 1943 at London&#x27;s Caxton Hall.

They continued with &quot;Yellow Canary&quot; (1943), co-starring Richard Greene and Margaret Rutherford. In this spy story, Neagle plays a German-sympathiser (or at least that is what she seems to be at first), who is forced to go to Canada for her own safety. In reality, of course, she is working as an undercover agent out to expose a plot to blow up Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia. &quot;Yellow Canary&quot; received positive comments for its atmospheric recreation of wartime conditions.

In 1945, Neagle appeared on stage in &quot;Emma&quot;, a dramatisation of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel. That same year, she was seen in the film &quot;I Live in Grosvenor Square&quot;, co-starring Rex Harrison. She wanted Harrison for the lead in her next film, &quot;Piccadilly Incident&quot; (1946). However, he (as well as John Mills) proved to be unavailable at the time, so Wilcox cast Michael Wilding in the lead. Thus was born what film critic Godfrey Winn called &quot;the greatest team in British films&quot;. The story – of a wife, presumed dead, returning to her (remarried) husband – bears a resemblance to the Irene Dunne–Cary Grant comedy &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot;. &quot;Piccadilly Incident&quot; was chosen as &quot;Picturegoer&#x27;s&quot; Best Film of 1947. Despite the fact that Neagle was some eight years senior than Wilding, they proved to be an extremely bankable romantic pairing at the British box office. By now in her mid-40s, Neagle continued to have success in youthful and romantic lead roles.

Neagle and Wilding were reunited in &quot;The Courtneys of Curzon Street&quot; (1947), a period drama that became the year&#x27;s top box-office attraction. The film featured Wilding as an upper-class dandy and Neagle as the maid he marries, only to have the two of them driven apart by Victorian society.

The third pairing of Neagle and Wilding in the &quot;London Films&quot;, as the series of films came to be called, was in &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; (1948). A comedy, this depicted the romance between a millionaire&#x27;s niece and a footman (actually a nobleman who has seen better days). The script was written by Nicholas Phipps, who also played Wilding&#x27;s brother. Although not a musical, it contains a dream sequence featuring the song &quot;The Moment I Saw You&quot;. &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; was the 1949 &quot;Picturegoer&quot; winner for Best Film, Actor, and Actress. Neagle and Wilding were together for a fourth time in the Technicolor romance &quot;Maytime in Mayfair&quot; (1949). The plot is reminiscent of &quot;Roberta&quot;, as it had Wilding inheriting a dress shop owned by Neagle.

By now, Neagle was at her peak as Britain&#x27;s top box-office actress, and she made what reputedly became her own favourite film, &quot;Odette&quot; (1950), co-starring Trevor Howard, Peter Ustinov, and Marius Goring. As Odette Sansom, she was the Anglo-French resistance fighter who was pushed to the edge of betrayal by the Nazis. In 1950, Neagle and Wilcox moved to the top-floor flat in Aldford House overlooking Park Lane, which was their home until 1964. She played Florence Nightingale in &quot;The Lady with a Lamp&quot; (1951), based on the 1929 play by Reginald Berkeley.

Returning to the stage in 1953, she scored a success with &quot;The Glorious Days&quot;, which had a run of 476 performances. Neagle and Wilcox brought the play to the screen under the title &quot;Lilacs in the Spring&quot; (1954), co-starring Errol Flynn. In the film, she plays an actress knocked out by a bomb, who dreams she is Queen Victoria and Nell Gwyn, as well as her own mother. As she begins dreaming, the film switches from black-and-white to colour. In Britain, where Neagle had top billing, the film was reasonably successful. In the United States, however, where Flynn had top billing, the title was changed to &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Up&quot;, and it flopped, with limited bookings.

=== On the wane ===

Neagle and Flynn reteamed for a second film, &quot;King&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; (1955), based on an Ivor Novello musical and also starring Patrice Wymore (Flynn&#x27;s wife at the time). Although Neagle performed several musical numbers for the film, most of them were cut from the final release, leaving her with essentially a supporting role. Shot in Eastmancolor and CinemaScope with location work near Barcelona, Spain, &quot;King&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; was a major flop everywhere. Neagle&#x27;s (and Flynn&#x27;s) box-office appeal, it seemed, was fading.

Neagle&#x27;s last box-office hit was &quot;My Teenage Daughter&quot; (1956), which featured her as a mother trying to prevent her daughter (Sylvia Syms) from lapsing into juvenile delinquency.

Neagle and Syms worked together again on &quot;No Time for Tears&quot; (1957), also starring Anthony Quayle and Flora Robson. As directed by Cyril Frankel, this was the first film for over 20 years where Neagle was directed by someone other than Herbert Wilcox. Set in a children&#x27;s hospital, the film features Neagle as a matron dealing with the problems of the patients and the staff, notably a nurse (Syms) infatuated with one of the doctors (George Baker).

With her husband, Neagle began producing films starring Frankie Vaughan, but these were out of touch with changing tastes, and lost money, resulting in Wilcox going heavily into debt. Neagle herself made her final film appearance in &quot;The Lady Is a Square&quot; (1959), also Wilcox&#x27;s last film as director.

Neagle was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in February 1958 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre, and in March 1983, when Andrews surprised her at London&#x27;s Royal National Hotel.

=== Final years ===

Herbert Wilcox was bankrupt by 1964, but his wife soon revived his fortunes. She returned to the stage the following year and made a comeback in the West End musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot;. In it, she played the role of a former &quot;Cochran Young Lady&quot; who marries a peer of the realm. &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; was not a critical success, but it ran for six years and 2,047 performances. It earned Neagle an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for her enduring popularity.

Two years after &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; – which she also performed in Australia and New Zealand – Neagle was asked to appear in a revival of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, having appeared in the screen version three decades earlier. Later, in 1975, she replaced Celia Johnson in &quot;The Dame of Sark&quot; and, in 1978 (the year after her husband&#x27;s death), she was acting in &quot;Most Gracious Lady&quot;, which was written for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

Although affected by Parkinson&#x27;s disease in her last years, Neagle continued to be active. She appeared in Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and in 1985 she appeared as the Fairy Godmother in a pantomime of &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the London Palladium.

Neagle&#x27;s grand-nephew is actor Nicholas Hoult, through Hoult&#x27;s father&#x27;s side.
Neagle died aged 81 from breast cancer on 3 June 1986. A memorial service at Westminster Abbey followed on 20 October 1986. She was interred alongside her husband in the City of London Cemetery. Their grave was recommemorated by Princess Anne, the Princess Royal on 6 March 2014.

A memorial plaque on her former home at Aldford House, Park Lane was unveiled on 30 May 1996, by Princess Anne and Lana Morris. She also has a memorial plaque in St Paul&#x27;s Church, the Actors&#x27; Church in Covent Garden.

A street named in her honour, Anna Neagle Close, is situated in Forest Gate, east London.

==Awards==

Neagle was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1952 New Year Honours and, for her contributions to the theatre, a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1969 Birthday Honours.

==Filmography==

The following list contains all of Neagle&#x27;s acting credits in feature-length films with the exception of &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; (1942), which is actually a compilation of two earlier films, &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; and &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot;. All of her films were directed by Herbert Wilcox and produced in the United Kingdom unless otherwise noted.

In addition, Neagle also appeared briefly as herself in a documentary short entitled &quot;The Volunteer&quot; (1943), and served as narrator for the films &quot;The Prams Break Through&quot; (1945) and &quot;Princess&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot; (1947). Neagle also produced, but did not appear in, three films starring Frankie Vaughan: &quot;These Dangerous Years&quot; (1957), &quot;Wonderful Things&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Heart of a Man&quot; (1959).

<text>The International Energy Agency (IEA) is a Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization, established in 1974, that provides policy recommendations, analysis and data on the global energy sector. The 31 member countries and 13 association countries of the IEA represent 75% of global energy demand.

The IEA was set up under the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis to respond to physical disruptions in global oil supplies, provide data and statistics about the global oil market and energy sector, promote energy savings and conservation, and establish international technical collaboration. Since its founding, the IEA has also coordinated use of the oil reserves that its members are required to hold.

In subsequent decades, the IEA&#x27;s role expanded to cover the entire global energy system, encompassing traditional fuels such as gas, and coal as well as cleaner and fast-growing energy sources and technologies including renewable energy sources; solar photovoltaics, wind power, biofuels as well as nuclear power, and hydrogen, and the critical minerals needed for these technologies.

The core activity of the IEA is providing policy advice to its member states and Associated countries to support their energy security and advance their transition to clean energy. Recently, it has focused in particular on supporting global efforts to accelerate clean energy transition, mitigate climate change, reach net zero emissions, and prevent global temperatures from rising above 1.5 °C. All IEA member countries have signed the Paris Agreement which aims to limit warming to 1.5 °C, and two thirds of IEA member governments have made commitments to emission neutrality by 2050.

The IEA&#x27;s current executive director is Fatih Birol, who took office in late 2015. IEA publishes a range of reports and other information including its flagship publication, the annual &quot;World Energy Outlook&quot;, as well as the &quot;Net Zero by 2050&quot; report.

== History ==
The IEA was founded on November 18, 1974, after the 1973 oil crisis, to avoid future shocks by helping to ensure reliable energy supplies, promote energy efficiency, ensure energy security and encourage technological research and innovation.

The Agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP Agreement) established the mandates and structure of the IEA, chartering it as an autonomous organisation under the umbrella of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In 1996, the IEA relocated its headquarters from the Château de la Muette, which it shared with the OECD, to commercially leased space located within the Embassy of Australia, Paris.

The IEA operates autonomously, with its own budget and governance structure. The organization began with 16 founding member countries and has since expanded to 31, with the latest addition being Lithuania in 2022. Full members of the IEA must also be members of the OECD and are required to hold 90 days worth of oil imports as emergency stocks. These emergency stocks can be released to stabilize oil markets worldwide and have been activated five times: January 1991 due to the Gulf War, 2005 after devastation in the Gulf of Mexico from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, 2011 during the Libyan crisis, and twice in 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In addition to the emergency release mechanism, the IEA&#x27;s initial mandates include reducing dependence on oil, developing alternative energy sources, energy research and development, and collaboration with oil-producing companies and countries to create a stable energy market. Members are expected to draw up plans on demand reduction and efficiency measures that can be implemented during energy emergencies.

In 2015, the IEA&#x27;s chief economist Fatih Birol was appointed executive director, the first time an official from within the organization was picked to lead it. They have a mandate to modernize the agency on three major pillars: broadening the IEA&#x27;s mandate on energy security beyond oil to include natural gas and electricity; increasing engagement in emerging economies through new Association partnerships; and expanding the IEA&#x27;s core focus on clean energy technology and energy efficiency.

The new category of &quot;Association countries&quot; was created in 2015, allowing countries that do not fit the criteria for IEA membership to become affiliated with the organization and participate in its work. China, Indonesia, and Thailand were the first to join and the IEA now has thirteen Association countries, including Ukraine since July 2022. IEA member and Association countries represent over 75% of global energy consumption.

In 2021, IEA chief Fatih Birol called on policymakers to do more to accelerate the clean energy transition and reduce emissions, saying that &quot;Clean-energy technologies are slowly but surely going to replace the existing energy industry.&quot;

After the IEA&#x27;s 2022 Ministerial meeting, a bi-annual high-level meeting of IEA countries, member countries once again expanded the organisation&#x27;s mandate to include accelerating the global clean energy transition by &quot;supporting countries in the global effort to attain net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector by mid-century.&quot; The &quot;IEA 3.0&quot; mandate also doubles down on strengthening energy security and recognizes the importance of tracking critical minerals and materials to the clean energy transition.

== Leadership ==
== Structure ==
The IEA&#x27;s structure includes a Governing Board, Ministerial Meetings, and Standing Groups and Committees.

The Governing Board constitutes the main decision-making body of the organisation. It is composed of member country representatives and meets three to four times a year. The Governing Board is responsible for the IEA&#x27;s administrative proceedings and approving binding decisions in relation to energy developments.

The IEA Ministerial Meeting is the biennial gathering of energy ministers who determine the broad direction of the IEA. The Ministerial allows for the development of ideas which are subsequently put to the Governing Board.

Standing Groups meet multiple times a year and are made up of officials from member states. The IEA has several Standing Groups and Committees, focusing on energy research and technology, long-term cooperation, emergency preparedness, and other topics.

== Membership ==
The 31 member countries and 13 association countries of the IEA represent 75% of global energy demand.

=== Member countries ===
Only OECD member states may join the IEA. Members are required to maintain total oil stock levels equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year&#x27;s net imports. Member countries commit to respond to significant oil disruptions through a collective action to allow more crude oil to enter the global market.
=== Accession countries ===
Accession countries are those going through the process of becoming full members. The process involves authorisation by the Governing Board, discussions with the executive director, and the sharing of information related to the criteria for membership with the Secretariat.

The following countries are currently undergoing the accession process:
* 
* 

=== Association countries ===
Association was formally launched in 2015 and currently includes 13 countries. The IEA collaborates with Association countries on a wide range of energy-related issues determined through joint programmes of work. Association countries may also participate in most Standing Groups and Ministerial meetings. Egypt and Argentina joined as Association countries in March 2022, and Ukraine was formally invited on 16 June 2022, and joined in July 2022.

== Areas of work ==
The IEA produces analyses on all energy sources and technologies, on global and regional markets, as well as specific country-level reports and studies on key technologies, minerals, and materials for the clean energy transition. It also produces comprehensive data and statistics for over 150 countries.

The IEA&#x27;s analytical work is split into various categories including policy recommendations, tracking, market forecasts, technical roadmapping, and scenario analysis.

=== Data ===
The IEA publishes comprehensive data, statistics, and analysis that inform national energy policies and support long-term planning for energy sector investments. The IEA analyses and releases data and information on trends in energy supply, demand, prices, public research and development, and energy efficiency metrics. The data also serves to track short- and long-term trends in countries energy transitions.

The Policies and Measures Database (PAMS) makes available to the public data on government policies and programs to reduce carbon emissions, support energy efficiency, and improve the development and use of renewable and clean energy sources. The database compiles data from several IEA and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) data sources dating back to 1999 and includes information on past, current, and planned policy measures.

=== Scenarios ===
IEA publications give projections based on sets of assumptions called &quot;scenarios&quot;. Currently-used scenarios include:

* Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS): Assumes implementation of governments&#x27; existing policies and firm commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
* Announced Pledges Scenario (APS): Assumes implementation of policies as in the STEPS, and also assumes fulfillment of looser pledges that are not yet backed by policy and legislation.
* Net Zero Scenario (NZE): Assumes implementation of the IEA&#x27;s pathway to net zero emissions by 2050 while minimising cost and meeting key UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Older scenarios include:

* 450 Scenario: Environmental groups have become critical of the IEA&#x27;s 450 Scenario (created to align with the 2009 Copenhagen Accord), contending it does not align with up-to-date climate science, nor is it consistent with the Paris climate agreement that aspires to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In March 2017, the IEA (along with IRENA) published a report that considers a safer climate scenario than their current 450S. This scenario offers improved chances of limiting global warming to less than two degrees, but – according to research organization Oil Change International – still falls short of adequately addressing climate science and the decarbonization required to reach agreed upon global climate limits. The IEA has stopped updating this safer climate scenario
* Sustainable Development Scenario: Concerns regarding the IEA&#x27;s Sustainable Development Scenario (the successor to the 450 scenario) has also been raised by climate scientists and key financial institutions, who have called for 1.5°C scenario placed centrally in the World Energy Outlook. The IEA&#x27;s Sustainable Development Scenario only gets to net-zero by 2070, two decades too late.

=== Key publications ===
World Energy Outlook (WEO)

Net Zero by 2050: a roadmap for the global energy sector

Net Zero by 2050 was published in May 2021 and presented the first comprehensive pathway for the global energy sector to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The report introduced the Net Zero Emissions scenario, showing how to transition to net zero by 2050 while maintaining secure and affordable energy supplies, extending energy access, and encouraging robust economic growth. The report was the basis for a game created by the IEA and the Financial Times in which players compete to see if they can reduce emissions to net zero. 

Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 

First issued in 2006, ETP is a bi-annual guidebook on clean energy technology. The publication focuses on challenges, growth areas, and strengths of emerging clean energy technologies and their contribution to global energy and environmental policy-making.

Global EV Outlook (GEVO)

Published annually with the support of the members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative, GEVO highlights and analyses recent developments in EVs and electric mobility. The publication combines historical analysis with projections to 2030 for topics such as charging infrastructure, emissions, energy use, and related policy developments.

Country Reviews

Since 1976, the IEA has published in-depth energy policy reviews. These country policy reviews are typically conducted every five years for member countries, and cover the full range of the country&#x27;s energy systems and policies, with recent reports placing particular focus on progress towards reaching climate goals. The most recent reports were on Norway, Poland, Belgium, and Canada. The IEA also produces in-depth energy reviews of its accession and association countries, as well as partner countries.

=== Energy Efficiency ===
In its focus on energy efficiency, the IEA convenes policy leaders and other stakeholders with an eye toward scaling up progress on energy efficiency as a way to mitigate climate change, contribute to energy security, and deliver economic, and support economies and communities. The IEA has created Energy Efficiency Indicators based on over ten years of data to highlight the drivers of individual nations&#x27; energy use in order to track energy efficiency and improve national policies. The data covers major sectors such as residential services, industry, and transport.

=== Clean Energy Transitions Programme ===
CETP&#x27;s focus is to &quot;accelerate global clean energy transitions, particularly in major emerging economies.&quot; The program supports governments whose energy policies will be key to the global energy transition and involves collaborative analytics, technology cooperation, stakeholder convenings, and training and capacity-building. CETP has identified Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa as priority countries as well as the regions of Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa.

=== People-Centered Clean Energy Transition ===
As part of its work on the energy transition, the IEA convenes the Global Commission for People-Centred Clean Energy Transitions to &quot;ensure the benefits and costs involved in the transformation of our energy system are distributed fairly and in a way that protects the most vulnerable in society.&quot; The approach focuses on skill development, jobs, worker protections, economic development, equity and fairness, social inclusion, and engaging individuals as stakeholders in the process. The commission is composed of national leaders, government ministers, and representatives from civil society. In October 2021, the Commission published a report for twelve recommendations for a people-centered approach to the clean energy transition.

=== Resilience of the Energy Sector to Climate Change Impacts ===
Given the implications of climate change impacts for energy security, the IEA also works to understand climate impacts on energy systems and provide guidance on measures to improve their resilience to these impacts. This includes an assessment of hydropower under different climate scenarios and a report focused on climate hazards for power systems and measures to enhance their climate resilience. The IEA also provides an overview of the level of climate hazards in its member countries, along with key planning and policy documents to address energy sector climate resilience.

=== Technology Collaboration Programs (TCPs) ===
TCPs provide support to independent, international groups of government and industry experts to research, develop, and commercialise energy technologies and related issues. Over 6,000 experts are involved in TCPs across approximately 300 organisations in 55 countries. Examples of TCPs include the Energy in Buildings and Communities (EBC), Photovoltaic Power Systems (PVPS), and Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (HEV).

== Criticism ==

=== Bias against renewable energy ===

The IEA has been criticised for systematically underestimating the role of renewable energy sources in future energy systems such as photovoltaics and their cost reductions.

In the past, the IEA has been criticized by environmental groups for underplaying the role of renewable energy technologies in favor of nuclear and fossil fuels. In 2009, Guy Pearse stated that the IEA has consistently underestimated the potential for renewable energy alternatives.

The Energy Watch Group (EWG), a coalition of scientists and politicians which analyses official energy industry predictions, claims that the IEA has had an institutional bias towards traditional energy sources and has been using &quot;misleading data&quot; to undermine the case for renewable energy, such as wind and solar. A 2008 EWG report compares IEA projections about the growth of wind power capacity and finds that it has consistently underestimated the amount of energy the wind power industry can deliver.

For example, in 1998, the IEA predicted global wind electricity generation would total 47.4 GW by 2020, but EWG&#x27;s report states that this level was reached by the end of 2004. The report also said that the IEA has not learned the lesson of previous underestimates, and last year net additions of wind power globally were four times greater than the average IEA estimate from its 1995–2004 predictions. This pattern seems to have continued through 2016.

Amid discontent from across the renewables sector at the IEA&#x27;s performance as a global energy watchdog, the International Renewable Energy Agency was formed on January 26, 2009. The aim is to have the agency fully operational by 2010 with an initial annual budget of €25M.

The IEA&#x27;s current forecasts for solar power do not accord with the exponential growth in the sector. The misleading projections have perpetuated the impression that the growth of solar power requires huge subsidies, and has the potential to discourage investment in solar energy market and consequently, hold back even faster growth.

=== Accuracy of forecasting ===
Ahead of the launch of the &quot;2009 World Energy Outlook&quot;, the British daily newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, referring to an unidentified senior IEA official, alleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of peak oil under pressures from the US. According to a second unidentified former senior IEA official it was &quot;imperative not to anger the Americans&quot; and that the world has already entered the &quot;peak oil zone&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; also referred to a team of scientists from Uppsala University in Sweden who studied the 2008 World Energy Outlook and concluded the forecasts of the IEA were unattainable. According to their peer-reviewed report, oil production in 2030 would not exceed while the IEA forecasts a production of . The lead author of the report, Kjell Aleklett, has claimed that IEA&#x27;s reports are &quot;political documents&quot;. Other research from the same group has thoroughly reviewed oil projections done by the IEA World Energy Outlook.

The anticorruption NGO Global Witness wrote in its report &quot;Heads in the Sand&quot; that &quot;Global Witness&#x27; analysis demonstrates that the Agency continues to retain an overly-optimistic, and therefore misleading, view about potential future oil production.&quot; According to Global Witness, &quot;the Agency&#x27;s over-confidence, despite credible data, external analysis and underlying fundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach, has had a disastrous global impact.&quot;

In 2023, the IEA predicted that demand for fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal would reach an all-time high by 2030. OPEC rejected the IEA&#x27;s forecast, saying &quot;what makes such predictions so dangerous, is that they are often accompanied by calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects.&quot; The IEA forecasts that ammonia will meet approximately 45% of shipping fuel demands by 2050.

=== Restricting access to data ===
In 2021, the IEA was publicly criticized by more than 30 international academics and researchers at Our World in Data for publishing its detailed, global energy data behind paywalls, &quot;[making] it unusable in the public discourse and [preventing] many researchers from accessing it&quot;. The authors of the Our World in Data open letter suggested that &quot;countries that fund the IEA drop the requirement to place data behind paywalls and increase their funding&quot;.

In January 2022, the IEA announced plans to make all its data and analyses freely available and open-access, a move endorsed by its executive director and governing board. This initiative was awaiting final endorsement from IEA member countries to become effective.

In October 2023, the IEA made the World Energy Outlook 2023 dataset available for non-commercial use under a Creative Commons license. This dataset encompasses global aggregated data for various scenarios, alongside detailed regional and country-specific data up to 2050.

===US shale===
In 2018, the IEA was criticized at the World Economic Forum by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Oil Minister Al-Falih, for hyping the US shale oil industry amid forecasts of oversupply for the oil market in their January Oil Market Report. Al-Falih was exasperated with those claims, arguing that natural depletion, and strong demand growth meant that there was plenty of room for new supplies, while the shale drillers would not crash the market. He further said that the IEA is overstating the role of shale in a global market, and how the core job of the IEA, is not to take things out of context.

<doc id="285293" wikidata="Q3106761" url="?curid=285293" title="Necrotizing gingivitis">
<text>Necrotizing gingivitis (NG) is a common, non-contagious infection of the gums with sudden onset. The main features are painful, bleeding gums, and ulceration of interdental papillae (the sections of gum between adjacent teeth). This disease, along with necrotizing periodontitis (NP) and necrotizing stomatitis, is classified as a necrotizing periodontal disease, one of the three general types of gum disease caused by inflammation of the gums (periodontitis).

The often severe gum pain that characterizes NG distinguishes it from the more common gingivitis or chronic periodontitis which is rarely painful. If NG is improperly treated or neglected, it may become chronic and/or recurrent. The causative organisms are mostly anaerobic bacteria, particularly Fusobacteriota and spirochete species.

Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, poor nutrition, psychological stress, and a weakened immune system. When the attachments of the teeth to the bone are involved, the term NP is used. Treatment of NG is by removal of dead gum tissue and antibiotics (usually metronidazole) in the acute phase, and improving oral hygiene to prevent recurrence. Although the condition has a rapid onset and is debilitating, it usually resolves quickly and does no serious harm. The informal name trench mouth arose during World War I as many soldiers developed the disease, probably because of the poor conditions and extreme psychological stress.

==Signs and symptoms==
In the early stages some affected people may complain of a feeling of tightness around the teeth. Three signs/symptoms must be present to diagnose this condition: 
* Severe gum pain.
* Profuse gum bleeding that requires little or no provocation.
* Interdental papillae are ulcerated with dead tissue. The papillary necrosis of NG has been described as &quot;punched out&quot;.

Other signs and symptoms may be present, but not always.
* Foul breath.
* Bad taste (metallic taste).

Malaise, fever and/or cervical lymph node enlargement are rare (unlike the typical features of herpetic stomatitis). Pain is fairly well localized to the affected areas. Systemic reactions may be more pronounced in children. Cancrum oris (noma) is a very rare complication, usually in debilitated children. Similar features but with more intense pain may be seen in necrotizing periodontitis in HIV/AIDS.

==Causes==
Necrotizing periodontal diseases are caused by a mixed bacterial infection that includes anaerobes such as &quot;P. intermedia&quot; and &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; as well as spirochetes, such as &quot;Treponema&quot;.

Necrotizing gingivitis may also be associated with diseases in which the immune system is compromised, including HIV/AIDS.
Necrotizing gingivitis is an opportunistic infection that occurs on a background of impaired local or systemic host defenses. The predisposing factors for necrotizing gingivitis are smoking, psychological stress, malnutrition, and immunosuppression. Regarding malnutrition, the fact that vitamin C deficiency is associated with gum disease, loosening of teeth, and poor wound healing shows how poor nutrition can predispose to oral disease; in such a circumstance, immune defenses against bacterial attack are most likely lower than usual. It is thus plausible that poor rations and supply line interruptions in World War I contributed to the incidence of trench mouth.

The following zones of infection have been described (superficial to deep): the bacterial zone, the neutrophil rich zone, the necrotic zone and the spirochetal zone.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually clinical. Smear for fusospirochaetal bacteria and leukocytes; blood picture occasionally. The important differentiation is with acute leukemia or herpetic stomatitis.

===Classification===
Necrotizing gingivitis is part of a spectrum of disease termed necrotizing periodontal diseases. It is the most minor form of this spectrum, with more advanced stages being termed necrotizing periodontitis, necrotizing stomatitis, and the most extreme, cancrum oris.

Necrotizing periodontitis (NP) is where the infection leads to attachment loss, and involves only the gingiva, periodontal ligament and alveolar ligament. Progression of the disease into tissue beyond the mucogingival junction characterizes necrotizing stomatitis.

== Treatment ==
Treatment includes irrigation and debridement of necrotic areas (areas of dead and/or dying gum tissue), oral hygiene instruction and the uses of mouth rinses and pain medication. If there is systemic involvement, then oral antibiotics may be given, such as metronidazole. As these diseases are often associated with systemic medical issues, proper management of the systemic disorders is appropriate.

== Prognosis ==
Untreated, the infection may lead to rapid destruction of the periodontium and can spread, as necrotizing stomatitis or noma, into neighbouring tissues in the cheeks, lips or the bones of the jaw. As stated, the condition can occur and be especially dangerous in people with weakened immune systems. This progression to noma is possible in malnourished susceptible individuals, with severe disfigurement possible.

==Epidemiology==
In developed countries, this disease occurs mostly in young adults. In developing countries, NUG may occur in children of low socioeconomic status, usually occurring with malnutrition (especially inadequate protein intake) and shortly after the onset of viral infections (e.g. measles).

Predisposing factors include smoking, viral respiratory infections and immune defects, such as in HIV/AIDS. Uncommon, except in lower socioeconomic classes, this typically affects adolescents and young adults, especially in institutions, armed forces, etc., or people with HIV/AIDS. The disease has occurred in epidemic-like patterns, but it is not contagious.

==History==
Necrotizing gingivitis has been observed for centuries. Xenophon observes sore mouth and foul smelling breath in Greek soldiers in the 4th century BC. Hunter describes the clinical features of necrotizing gingivitis in 1778, differentiating it from scurvy (avitaminosis C) and chronic periodontitis. Jean Hyacinthe Vincent, a French physician working at the Paris Pasteur Institute describes a fusospirochetal infection of the pharynx and palatine tonsils, causing &quot;ulcero-membranous pharyngitis and tonsillitis&quot;, which later became known as Vincent&#x27;s angina. Later in 1904, Vincent describes the same pathogenic organisms in &quot;ulceronecrotic gingivitis&quot;. Vincent&#x27;s angina is sometimes confused with NUG, however the former is tonsillitis and pharyngitis, and the latter involves the gums, and usually the two conditions occur in isolation from each other.

The term trench mouth evolved because the disease was observed in front line soldiers during World War I, thought to be a result at least partly because of extreme psychologic stress they were exposed to. The same condition was appearing in civilians during periods of bombing raids, who were away from the front line, and who had relatively good diets during wartime due to rationing, so it is assumed that psychologic stress was the significant causative factor. It has also been associated with high tobacco use in the army.

Many other historical names for this condition (and Vincent&#x27;s angina) have occurred, including: &quot;acute membranous gingivitis&quot;, &quot;fusospirillary gingivitis&quot;, &quot; fusospirillosis&quot;, &quot;fusospirochetal gingivitis&quot;, &quot;phagedenic gingivitis&quot;, &quot;Vincent stomatitis&quot;, &quot;Vincent gingivitis&quot;, and &quot;Vincent infection&quot;.

In the late 1980s-early 1990s, it was originally thought that some necrotizing periodontal diseases seen in severely affected AIDS patients were strictly a sequela of HIV, and it was even called HIV-associated periodontitis. It is now understood that its association with HIV/AIDS was due to the immunocompromised status of such patients; it also occurs with higher prevalence in association with other diseases in which the immune system is compromised.

The 1999 American Academy of Periodontology Classification termed the condition &quot;necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis&quot;. The &quot;ulcerative&quot; descriptor was removed from the name, because ulceration is considered to be secondary to the necrosis.

<doc id="285294" wikidata="Q1969172" url="?curid=285294" title="Facial feminization surgery">
<text>Facial feminization surgery (FFS) is a set of reconstructive surgical procedures that alter typically male facial features to bring them closer in shape and size to typical female facial features. FFS can include various bony and soft tissue procedures such as brow lift, rhinoplasty, cheek implantation, and lip augmentation.

Faces contain secondary sex characteristics that make male and female faces readily distinguishable, including the shape of the forehead, nose, lips, cheeks, chin, and jawline; the features in the upper third of the face seem to be the most important, and subtle changes in the lips can have a strong effect.

==Candidates==
For some transgender women and non binary people, FFS is medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria. It can be just as important or even more important than genital forms of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in reducing gender dysphoria and helping trans women integrate socially as women; data on these sorts of outcomes are limited by small study size and confounding variables like other feminization procedures. While most FFS patients are transgender women, some cisgender women who feel that their faces are too masculine will also undergo FFS.

FFS candidates should wait until the bones of their skull have stopped growing before undergoing FFS. The way to determine if the bones of the skull have stopped growing is to take successive radiographs of the mandible and wrist bones to make sure that bone growth has stopped.

==Surgical procedures==
The surgical procedures most frequently performed during FFS include the following.

===Upper third of face===
Some studies have shown that the shape of the forehead is one of the key differences between cisgender males and cisgender females. Hairline correction, forehead recontouring, eye socket recontouring, and brow lift are procedures often performed at the same time, with rhinoplasty in mind.

;Hairline correction
In males, the hairline is often higher than in females and usually has receded corners above the temples that give it an &quot;M&quot; shape. The hairline can be moved forward and given a more rounded shape, either with a procedure called a &quot;scalp advance&quot; wherein the scalp is lifted and repositioned, or with hair transplantation.

;Forehead recontouring
Cisgender males tend to have a horizontal ridge of bone running across the forehead just above eyebrow level called the brow ridge (or &quot;brow bossing&quot;), which includes the &quot;supraorbital rims&quot; (the lower edge, on which the eyebrows sit). Cisgender males also tend to have indented temples and a flatter forehead than females.

The brow ridge is usually solid bone and can simply be ground down. The section of bossing between the eyebrows (the glabella) sits over a hollow area called the frontal sinus. The frontal sinus is hollow, and thus it can be more difficult to remove bossing there. If the bone over the frontal sinus is thick enough the bossing can be removed by simply grinding down the bone. However, in some people, the wall of bone is so thin that it is not possible to grind the bossing away completely without breaking through the wall into the frontal sinus.

FFS surgeons have taken two main approaches to resolving this problem. The most conservative approach is to grind down the wall of bone as far as possible without breaking through, and then build up the area around any remaining bossing with hydroxyapatite bone cement which can smooth out any visible step between remaining bossing and the rest of the forehead. In these cases, some additional reduction in the bossing can sometimes be achieved by thinning the soft tissues that sit over it. Alternatively, FFS surgeons can perform a procedure called a forehead reconstruction or cranioplasty where the glabella bone is taken apart, thinned and re-shaped, and reassembled in the new feminine position with small titanium wires or titanium orthopedic plate and screws. The data on which approach is better is limited and does not provide guidance. The risks of cranioplasty include the skull not healing properly, movement of the bone fragments, and the formation of cysts; these can usually be corrected by another procedure.

;Brow lift
Cisgender men tend to have lower eyebrows relative to the position of their brow ridges when compared to cisgender women. Cis men&#x27;s eyebrows tend to be below their brow ridges while cis women&#x27;s eyebrows tend to be above their brow ridges. Accordingly, FFS to raise the eyebrows results in a face with a more womanly appearance.

;Orbit recontouring
In some studies, the eye shape has been shown to be the key differentiating feature between cis males and females. Cis female eye sockets tend to be smaller, located higher on the face, to have more sharply angled outer edges, and to be closer together at their inner edges (the intercanthal distance). Some FFS alter the orbit shape; data on outcomes is limited.

===Rhinoplasty===
Cis males tend to have larger, longer, and wider noses than cis females; also, the tip of the female nose will more often visibly point slightly upwards than that of a male. Hence, the procedure involves removing bone and cartilage and remodelling what remains. In most cases this is performed in an open procedure, but endonasal procedures have been used; in all cases when reducing the nose there is a risk of interfering with nasal valve function. Standard rhinoplasty procedures are generally used. There is limited data on outcomes.

===Cheek implants===
Cis females often have more forward projection in their cheekbones as well as fuller cheeks overall, with a triangle formed by the cheekbones and the point of the chin. Planning of cheek contouring is done while planning reshaping of the chin. The cheeks are reshaped by cutting away bone and repositioning the facial bones. Augmenting the cheeks with implants or with fat harvested from other parts of the body is common. Risks of implants include infection, and the implant moving and becoming asymmetrical; fat can eventually be absorbed.

===Lips===
Subtle changes to the shape and structure of lips can have a strong influence on feminization. The distance between the base of the nose and the top of the upper lip tends to be longer in males than in females and the upper lip is longer; when a female mouth is open and relaxed, the upper incisors are often exposed by a few millimeters.

An incision is usually made just under the base of the nose and a section of skin is removed. When the gap is closed it has the effect of lifting the top lip, placing it in a more feminine position and often exposing a little of the upper incisors. The surgeon can also use a lip lift to roll the top lip out a little, making it appear fuller.

Cis females often have fuller lips than cis males, so lip filling is often used in feminization. Injectable fillers are low-risk but tend to be absorbed after six months or so, and many implants have higher complication rates like infection or rejection. Use of fat harvested from the person can result in lumps and does not last long. The longest lasting and least risky results appear to arise from use of acellular dermis products.

===Chin and jaw contouring===
The chins of cis males tend to be longer and wider than those of cis females, with a more square base, and to project outward more than female chins. Cis male jawlines tend to extend outward from the chin at a wider angle than those of cis females, and to have a sharp corner at the back. 

The chin can be reduced in length either by bone shaving or with a procedure called a &quot;sliding genioplasty&quot;, where a section of bone is removed. The jaw can be reshaped through jaw reduction surgery; sometimes this is done through the mouth. The chewing muscles can also be reduced to make the jaw appear narrower.

The biggest risk in these procedures is damage to the mental nerve that runs through the chin and jaw; other risks include damage to tooth roots, infection, nonunion, and damage to the mentalis muscle that controls the lower lip and is at the edges of the chin.

===Adam&#x27;s apple reduction===
Males tend to have a much more prominent Adam&#x27;s apple than females following puberty. The Adam&#x27;s apple can be reduced with a procedure called a chondrolaryngoplasty; the goal of the procedure is to reduce the size without leaving a scar. There are risks of damage to the vocal cords and destabilization of the epiglottis.

===Associated procedures===
Beautification and rejuvenation procedures are often performed at the same time as facial feminisation. For example, it is common for eye bags and sagging eyelids to be corrected with a procedure called &quot;blepharoplasty&quot; and many feminization patients undergo a face and neck lift.

==History==
FFS techniques are derived from maxillofacial, otolaryngology, and plastic aesthetic and reconstructive surgery.

FFS began in 1982 when Darrell Pratt, a plastic surgeon who performed sex reassignment surgeries, approached Douglas Ousterhout with a request from a transgender woman patient of Pratt&#x27;s; the patient wanted plastic surgery to make her face appear more feminine, since people still reacted to her as though she were a man. Ousterhout&#x27;s prior practice had involved reconstructing faces and skulls of people who had had birth defects, accidents, or other trauma. Ousterhout was interested in helping but knew that he did not know what a &quot;female face&quot; was, so he investigated by first reading the physical anthropology from the early 20th century to identify what features were &quot;female&quot;, then deriving measurements defining those features from a series of cephalograms taken in the 1970s, and then working with a set of several hundred skulls to see if he could reliably differentiate which were females and which were males using those measurements. Ousterhout then began working out what surgical techniques and materials he already used could be applied in order to transform a male face into a female face. He pioneered most of the procedures involved in FFS and was involved in their subsequent improvements as well.

<doc id="285296" wikidata="Q333569" url="?curid=285296" title="Willie Gallacher (politician)">
<text>William Gallacher (25 December 1881 – 12 August 1965) was a Scottish trade unionist, activist and communist. He was one of the leading figures of the Shop Stewards&#x27; Movement in wartime Glasgow (the &#x27;Red Clydeside&#x27; period) and a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He served two terms in the House of Commons as one of the last Communist Members of Parliament.

== Early career ==
Gallacher was born in Paisley, Scotland, on 25 December 1881, the son of an Irish father and a Scottish mother. His father died when he was seven years old, and one of his earliest ambitions was to earn enough money so that his mother would no longer have to work as a washerwoman. With his sisters, he finally achieved that goal at the age of 19, but his mother died shortly afterwards at the age of 54.

He began working at 10 years old, and left school at 12. After a spell as a delivery boy for a grocer, where he had his first dispute with an employer, he found work in a sanitary engineering workshop. He later had a spell as a steward on some transatlantic crossings before he began work at Albion Motor Works, Glasgow, in 1912. After spending 1913 in the United States to visit his sisters in Chicago, he erected scaffolding in Belfast. Returning to Glasgow, he again found work at Albion Motor Works in 1914, just before the First World War broke out.

The &quot;weakness for alcohol&quot; shown by his father and elder brother, and the suffering that it caused his mother, led him to become involved with the Temperance movement in his mid-adolescence. However, on discovering that colleagues had canvassed support for a director of a Trust Public House in the 1906 general election, Gallacher ended his association with the organised Temperance movement. He remained a lifelong teetotaller.

A subsequent period as a member of the Independent Labour Party ended quickly, and he joined the Social Democratic Federation, which brought him into contact with John MacLean. In common with many socialists in mid-west Scotland, Gallacher was greatly influenced by MacLean though they were later to have an acrimonious falling out. The Paisley branch of the SDF introduced him to John Ross Campbell, who would also become a prominent British Communist and the editor of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; from 1949 to 1959.

== Wartime activities ==
Gallacher was opposed to British involvement in World War I. He was Chairman of the Clyde Workers&#x27; Committee, an organisation that was formed to organise Clydeside workers and, in particular, to campaign against the Munitions of War Act 1915, which forbade engineers to leave the works in which they were employed. David Lloyd George and Arthur Henderson met Gallacher and the Clyde Workers&#x27; Committee in Glasgow, but they were unwilling to back down on the issue. In 1916, the Clyde Workers&#x27; Committee journal, &quot;The Worker&quot;, was prosecuted under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 for an article criticising the war. Gallacher and the editor John Muir were both found guilty and sent to prison, Gallacher for six months and Muir for one year.

== Gallacher and the 40 Hours Movement ==
After the war, Gallacher was involved in the struggle for improving workers&#x27; conditions. It was widely expected that the end of the war would be followed by widespread unemployment because of the re-entry of large numbers of demobilised soldiers and seamen into the workforce. Glasgow was expected to be particularly badly affected because a large proportion of its workforce was employed in war-related areas such as munitions and shipbuilding, which would suddenly contract with the end of the war. Gallacher and the Clyde Workers&#x27; Committee proposed a campaign to limit working hours to thirty hours per week, which was altered to forty hours per week after the Glasgow Trades Council became involved. In January 1919, the CWC and Trades Council launched a mass strike in support of the demand for a 40-hour working week.

During the course of the agitation, the police broke up the mass rally of striking workers at George Square, Glasgow, on 31 January 1919. The Coalition government greatly overreacted to the strike since it thought that a Bolshevik insurrection was about to begin on Clydeside. It sent British Army troops onto the streets of Glasgow to control the situation. Revolution was the furthest thing from the minds of the trade union leaders of the day, but Gallacher later claimed that they should have marched to the barracks in the Maryhill district of the city and encouraged the Scottish troops there to leave them and join the workers against the government. The union leaders of the strike were arrested and charged with &quot;instigating and inciting large crowds of persons to form part of a riotous mob&quot;. Gallacher was sent back to jail and was sentenced to five months.

== Political career ==
In 1920, Gallacher became a leading figure of the Communist Labour Party. He led the grouping into the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and stood for election to the House of Commons at Dundee (both in 1922 and 1923), West Fife (1929 and 1931) and Shipley (1930). He was eventually elected to represent the West Fife constituency at the 1935 general election.

In 1925, Gallacher was one of twelve members of the Communist Party convicted at the Old Bailey under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797, and one of the five defendants sentenced to twelve months&#x27; imprisonment. In 1936, Gallacher supported the views of members of the Labour Party such as Stafford Cripps and Aneurin Bevan, who were arguing in favour of giving military assistance to the Spanish Popular Front government fighting against Franco&#x27;s Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. He criticized appeasement and attacked the National Government for considering inviting Hermann Göring to London.

Gallacher lost his West Fife seat to the Labour Party at the 1950 general election, coming third behind the National Liberal candidate. He remained politically active serving as President of the CPGB from 1956 to 1963. In an article published in the party&#x27;s &quot;Labour Monthly&quot; in April 1953 he appraised the career of Joseph Stalin; the Soviet First Secretary had died the previous month, concluding with the assertion that &quot;his life ended with his work completed, for the Party and the Soviet people still under his wise guidance will go forward, resolute as he was resolute—to the new truly free society of Marx and Engels, of Lenin and of Stalin&quot;.

Gallacher was the author of several books, including &quot;The Case for Communism&quot; (1949), his autobiography, &quot;The Chosen Few&quot; (1940), and &quot;The Tyrant&#x27;s Might is Passing&quot; (1954). He also wrote a book about his experiences during the First World War, &quot;Revolt on the Clyde&quot;, and &quot;The Last Memoirs of William Gallacher&quot;.

Gallacher died in Paisley on 12 August 1965, aged 83.

<doc id="285297" wikidata="Q661995" url="?curid=285297" title="Morgenthau Plan">
<text>The Morgenthau Plan was a proposal to weaken Germany following World War II by eliminating its arms industry and removing or destroying other key industries basic to military strength. This included the removal or destruction of all industrial plants and equipment in the Ruhr. It was first proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. in a 1944 memorandum entitled &quot;Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany&quot;.

While the Morgenthau Plan had some influence until 10 July 1947 (adoption of JCS 1779) on Allied planning for the occupation of Germany, it was not adopted. US occupation policies aimed at &quot;industrial disarmament&quot;, but contained a number of deliberate loopholes, limiting any action to short-term military measures and preventing large-scale destruction of mines and industrial plants, giving wide-ranging discretion to the military governor and Morgenthau&#x27;s opponents at the War Department. An investigation by Herbert Hoover concluded the plan was unworkable, and would result in up to 25 million Germans dying from starvation. From 1947, US policies aimed at restoring a &quot;stable and productive Germany&quot; and were soon followed by the Marshall Plan.

When the Morgenthau Plan was published by the US press in September 1944, it was immediately seized upon by the Nazi German government and used as part of propaganda efforts in the final seven months of the war in Europe that aimed to convince Germans to fight on.

==Proposals==
===Morgenthau&#x27;s memorandum===

The original memorandum, written some time between January and early September 1944, signed by Morgenthau, and headed &quot;Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany&quot;, is preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. According to Morgenthau&#x27;s son, senior U.S. Treasury Department official and alleged Soviet spy Harry Dexter White was influential in drafting the memorandum.

The main provisions can be summarized as follows:
The Morgenthau Plan, in the sense of the plan drafted by Morgenthau or the plan initialed by Roosevelt, was never implemented. Germany was not made &quot;primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character&quot;. However, some commentators, such as Gareau, extend the term to mean &quot;any postwar program designed to effect and preserve German disarmament by significantly reducing German industrial might&quot;. JCS-1067, the April 1945 &quot;Directive to Commander-in-Chief of United States Forces of Occupation Regarding the Military Government of Germany&quot; specified the Allied objective as being &quot;to prevent Germany from ever again becoming a threat to the peace of the world&quot;, including, as an essential step, &quot;the industrial disarmament and demilitarization of Germany&quot;.

===United States===

As Secretary of the Treasury, Morgenthau was initially not involved in the drafting of the plans for Germany. On a trip to Europe at the beginning of August, Harry Dexter White, his most trusted collaborator in the Treasury Department, presented him the memorandum from the State Department. This memorandum left Morgenthau with the impression that the main aim was to rebuild Germany economically to such an extent that after a few years they would be able to pay reparations. For him, it came down to the supposition that after 10 years they would be ready to start World War III.

After his return from Europe, Morgenthau informed Secretary of State Cordell Hull that he would immediately take care of Germany&#x27;s affairs with the following words: &quot;I appreciate the fact that this isn&#x27;t my responsibility, but I&#x27;m doing this as an American citizen, and I&#x27;m going to continue to do so, and I&#x27;m going to stick my nose into it until I know it is all right.&quot; He right away informed the President of his observations and the dangers he saw in the existing memorandum drawn up by Hull. The President showed increased interest in what had been accomplished, but despite all of Morgenthau&#x27;s hopes, Roosevelt initially did not officially invite him to take part in the drafting of the plans.

Morgenthau now tried to achieve his objective in another way. In a meeting with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson shortly thereafter, he suggested that a committee consisting of Stimson, Hull, and himself should meet to work out a memorandum for the upcoming conference in Quebec. In his next attempt at the President, he once again made clear that implementing the plan as it stood would have undesirable consequences. He also exclusively showed excerpts that he knew would displease the President. The lecture did not miss its aim. Morgenthau&#x27;s explanations persuaded Roosevelt to write to Hull and Stimson that US occupation policy, which anticipated that &quot;Germany is to be restored just as much as the Netherlands or Belgium&quot;, was excessively lenient. A better policy would have the Germans &quot;fed three times a day with soup from Army soup kitchens&quot;, so &quot;they will remember that experience the rest of their lives&quot;.

In addition, Roosevelt officially set up a committee consisting of Morgenthau, Stimson, and Hull to deal with the future of Germany. However, due to serious disagreement, the committee was unable to draw up a collaborative memorandum. Morgenthau on one side was drafting plans for how Germany could be ruined industrially, while other parts of the US government were already forging plans for how the country could be rebuilt after Nazi rule. Above all, the American business elite, which was still closely intertwined with German companies during the war, was interested in getting back to business as soon as possible. Hull, on the other hand, was outraged by Morgenthau&#x27;s &quot;inconceivable intrusion&quot; into foreign policy. Hull told Roosevelt that the plan would inspire last-ditch resistance and cost thousands of American lives. Hull was so upset over the plan that he suffered from insomnia and eating problems and was hospitalized. He said that nothing would be left to Germany but land, and only 60% of the Germans could live off the land, meaning 40% of the population would die. Stimson expressed his opposition even more forcefully to Roosevelt. Hull later resigned for health reasons, though there were anecdotal reports that his resignation was brought about by &quot;the Morgenthau business&quot;. So it came about that the Cabinet Committee on Germany met with Roosevelt on September 6, 1944, and discussed three different memoranda prepared by the State, War, and Treasury Departments.

===Second Quebec Conference (September 1944)===

At the Second Quebec Conference, a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, 12–16 September 1944, the British and United States governments, represented by Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt respectively, reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany, based on Morgenthau&#x27;s original proposal. The memorandum drafted by Churchill provided for &quot;eliminating the warmaking industries in the Ruhr and the Saar ... looking forward to converting Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character&quot;. However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states. This memorandum is also referred to as the Morgenthau Plan.

The fact that Morgenthau was able to present his plans in Quebec despite the great resistance within the US government is precisely due to Hull&#x27;s poor health. In fact, Roosevelt had asked Hull to accompany him to Quebec, but he was unable to do so for health reasons. It was only at the last minute, when the conference was on, that Roosevelt asked Morgenthau to follow him to Quebec. Ultimately, Roosevelt&#x27;s motivations for agreeing to Morgenthau&#x27;s proposal may be attributed to his desire to be on good terms with Joseph Stalin and to a personal conviction that Germany must be treated harshly. In a 26 August 1944 letter to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Roosevelt wrote that &quot;There are two schools of thought, those who would be altruistic in regard to the Germans, hoping by loving kindness to make them Christians againand those who would adopt a much &#x27;tougher&#x27; attitude. Most decidedly I belong to the latter school, for though I am not bloodthirsty, I want the Germans to know that this time at least they have definitely lost the war&quot;.

===British reaction===
Churchill was not initially inclined to support the proposal, saying &quot;England would be chained to a dead body&quot;. Roosevelt reminded Churchill of Stalin&#x27;s comments at the Tehran Conference, and asked &quot;Are you going to let Germany produce modern metal furniture? The manufacture of metal furniture can be quickly turned into the manufacture of armament.&quot; The meeting broke up on Churchill&#x27;s disagreement but Roosevelt suggested that Morgenthau and White continue to discuss with Lord Cherwell, Churchill&#x27;s personal assistant.

Lord Cherwell has been described as having &quot;an almost pathological hatred for Nazi Germany, and an almost medieval desire for revenge was a part of his character&quot;. Morgenthau is quoted as saying to his staff that &quot;I can&#x27;t overemphasize how helpful Lord Cherwell was because he could advise how to handle Churchill&quot;. In any case, Cherwell was able to persuade Churchill to change his mind. Churchill later said that &quot;At first I was violently opposed to the idea. But the President and Mr. Morgenthau from whom we had much to askwere so insistent that in the end we agreed to consider it&quot;.

Some have read into the clause &quot;from whom we had much to ask&quot; that Churchill was bought off, and note a September 15 memo from Roosevelt to Hull stating that &quot;Morgenthau has presented at Quebec, in conjunction with his plan for Germany, a proposal of credits to Britain totalling six and half billion dollars&quot;. Hull&#x27;s comment on this was that &quot;this might suggest to some the quid pro quo with which the Secretary of the Treasury was able to get Mr. Churchill&#x27;s adherence to his cataclysmic plan for Germany&quot;.

At Quebec, White made sure that Lord Cherwell understood that economic aid to Britain was dependent on British approval of the plan. During the signing of the plan, which coincided with the signing of a loan agreement, President Roosevelt proposed that they sign the plan first. This prompted Churchill to exclaim: &quot;What do you want me to do? Get on my hind legs and beg like Fala?&quot;

Anthony Eden expressed his strong opposition to the plan and, with the support of some others, was able to get the Morgenthau Plan set aside in Britain.

==Impact on the war==
Journalist Drew Pearson publicized the plan on 21 September 1944. Although Pearson himself was sympathetic to it, more critical stories in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; quickly followed. Joseph Goebbels used the Morgenthau Plan in his propaganda. Goebbels said that &quot;The Jew Morgenthau&quot; wanted to make Germany into a giant potato patch. The headline of the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; stated, &quot;Roosevelt and Churchill Agree to Jewish Murder Plan!&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; urged a stop to helping Dr. Goebbels: if the Germans suspect that nothing but complete destruction lies ahead, then they will fight on. Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey complained in his campaign that the plan had terrified the Germans into fanatical resistance: &quot;Now they are fighting with the frenzy of despair.&quot;

General George Marshall complained to Morgenthau that German resistance had strengthened. Hoping to get Morgenthau to relent on his plan for Germany, President Roosevelt&#x27;s son-in-law Lt. Colonel John Boettiger, who worked in the War Department, explained to Morgenthau how the American troops who had to fight for five weeks against fierce German resistance to capture the city of Aachen had complained to him that the Morgenthau Plan was &quot;worth thirty divisions to the Germans&quot;. Morgenthau refused to relent.

On 11 December 1944, OSS operative William Donovan sent Roosevelt a telegraph message from Bern, warning him of the consequences that the knowledge of the Morgenthau plan had had on German resistance. The message was a translation of a recent article in the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;.
Following the negative public reaction to the publishing of the Morgenthau plan, President Roosevelt disowned it, saying &quot;About this pastoral, agricultural Germany, that is just nonsense. I have not approved anything like that. I am sure I have not. ... I have no recollection of this at all&quot;. According to Stimson, the President said that he just wanted to help Britain get a share of the Ruhr and denied that he intended to fully deindustrialize Germany. Stimson replied, &quot;Mr. President, I don&#x27;t like you to dissemble to me&quot; and read back to Roosevelt what he had signed. Struck by this, Roosevelt said he had &quot;no idea how he could have initialed this&quot;. The theory that Roosevelt was not truly rejecting the plan is supported by later remarks by Eleanor Roosevelt, who stated that she never heard him disagree with the basics of the plan, and who believed that &quot;the repercussions brought about by the press stories made him feel that it was wise to abandon any final solution at that time&quot;. However, other sources suggest that Roosevelt &quot;had not realized the devastating nature of the program he had initialed&quot;.

==Morgenthau&#x27;s book &quot;Germany is Our Problem&quot;==

In October 1945, Harper and Brother published Morgenthau&#x27;s book &quot;Germany is Our Problem&quot;, where Morgenthau described his plan and the rationale for it in greater detail. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had granted permission for the publication of the book the evening before his death, when dining with Morgenthau at Warm Springs.

A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 7 October 1945 felt that the book was important to the survival of the American people and would help prevent World War III. A review by Orville Prescott on 5 October 1945 in the same newspaper concluded that the whole world would benefit if copies of the book reached the key US decisionmakers responsible for policy about Germany.

In November 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the military governor of the US Occupation Zone, approved the distribution of 1,000 free copies of the book to American military officials in occupied Germany. Historian Stephen Ambrose draws the conclusion that, despite Eisenhower&#x27;s later claims that the act was not an endorsement of the Morgenthau plan, Eisenhower both approved of the plan and had previously given Morgenthau at least some of his ideas on how Germany should be treated.

==Occupation policy==
===JCS 1067===
A &quot;Handbook for Military Government in Germany&quot; was ready in August 1944: it advocated a quick restoration of normal life for the German people and reconstruction of Germany. Henry Morgenthau Jr. brought it to the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who, after reading it, rejected it with the words:


A new document was drafted, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directive 1067 (JCS 1067), which directed the US forces of occupation in Germany to &quot;take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [nor steps] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy&quot;. It was also ordered that starvation, disease and civil unrest were to be kept below such levels where they would pose a danger to the troops of occupation. The directive was approved by President Truman on 10 May 1945, then formally issued to Eisenhower, and was the basis for US occupation policy until July 1947. It applied only to the US zone (although attempts had been made to get the other Allies to accept it). The occupation directive remained secret until 17 October 1945. It was made known to the public two months after the US had succeeded in incorporating much of it into the Potsdam Agreement.

Morgenthau had been able to wield considerable influence over JCS 1067 and, like the Morgenthau Plan, intended to reduce German living standards. The production of oil, rubber, merchant ships, and aircraft were prohibited. Occupation forces were not to assist with economic development apart from the agricultural sector. Ignoring the amendments to JCS 1067 that had been inserted by John J. McCloy of the War Department, Morgenthau told his staff that it was a big day for the Treasury, and that he hoped that &quot;someone doesn&#x27;t recognize it as the Morgenthau Plan&quot;.

In occupied Germany, Morgenthau left a direct legacy through what in OMGUS commonly were called &quot;Morgenthau boys&quot;. These were US Treasury officials whom Dwight D. Eisenhower had &quot;loaned&quot; to the Army of occupation. These people ensured that JCS 1067 was interpreted as strictly as possible. They were most active in the first crucial months of the occupation, but continued their activities for almost two years following the resignation of Morgenthau in mid-1945 and, some time later, also of their leader Colonel Bernard Bernstein, who was &quot;the repository of the Morgenthau spirit in the army of occupation&quot;.

===Consequences===
The problems brought on by the execution of these types of policies were eventually apparent to most American officials in Germany. Germany had long been the industrial giant of Europe, and its poverty held back the general European recovery. The continued scarcity in Germany also led to considerable expenses for the occupying powers, which were obligated to try to make up the most important shortfalls through the GARIOA (Government and Relief in Occupied Areas) program. 

General Lucius D. Clay, US High Commissioner, later wrote in his 1950 book &quot;Decision in Germany&quot;, &quot;It seemed obvious to us even then that Germany would starve unless it could produce for export and that immediate steps would have to be taken to revive industrial production&quot;. Lewis Douglas, chief adviser to General Clay, denounced JCS Directive 1067 saying, &quot;This thing was assembled by economic idiots. It makes no sense to forbid the most skilled workers in Europe from producing as much as they can in a continent that is desperately short of everything&quot;. Douglas went to Washington in the hopes of having the directive revised but was unable to do so. However, American policy slowly drifted away from &quot;industrial disarmament&quot;. Herbert Hoover&#x27;s situation reports from 1947, and &quot;A Report on Germany&quot; also served to help change occupation policy, among other things through speaking frankly of the expected consequences:

According to Alan S. Milward, in 1946–1947 the average kilocalorie intake per day in Germany was only 1,080, an amount insufficient for long-term health. Other sources state that the kilocalorie intake in those years varied between as low as 1,000 and 1,500. William Clayton reported to Dean Acheson in Washington on May 27, 1947: &quot;Millions of people in the cities are slowly starving.&quot; The Western powers&#x27; worst fear by now was that the poverty and hunger would drive the Germans to Communism. General Lucius Clay stated &quot;There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand&quot;.

In view of the continued poverty and famine in Europe, and with the onset of the Cold War which made it important not to lose all of Germany to the communists, it was apparent by 1947 that a change of policy was required. After lobbying by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Generals Clay and Marshall, the Truman administration realized that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent.

===Revocation of JCS 1067 and replacement with JCS 1779===
In July 1947, President Truman rescinded on &quot;national security grounds&quot; the punitive JCS 1067, which had directed the US forces of occupation in Germany to &quot;take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany&quot;. It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that &quot;[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany&quot;. JCS 1067 had then been in effect for over two years.

The change was heralded by &quot;Restatement of Policy on Germany&quot;, a famous speech by James F. Byrnes, then United States Secretary of State, held in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946. Also known as the &quot;Speech of hope&quot;, it set the tone of future US policy as it repudiated the Morgenthau Plan economic policies and with its message of change to a policy of economic reconstruction gave the Germans hope for the future. The most notable example of this change of policy was that the Marshall Plan was extended to West Germany, although in the form of loans instead of the free aid granted to other countries.

It took over two months for General Clay to overcome continued resistance to the new directive JCS 1779, but on 10 July 1947 it was approved at a meeting of the SWNCC (State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee). The final version of the document &quot;was purged of the most important elements of the Morgenthau plan&quot;. The &quot;Morgenthau boys&quot; resigned &quot;en masse&quot; when JCS 1779 was approved, but before they went, the Morgenthau followers in the decartelization division of OMGUS accomplished one last task in the spring of 1947: the destruction of the old German banking system. By breaking the relationships between German banks, they cut off the flow of credit between them, limiting them to short-term financing only, thus preventing the rehabilitation of German industry and with immediate adverse effects on the economy in the US occupation zone.

With the change of occupation policy, most significantly thanks to the currency reform of 1948, Germany eventually made an impressive recovery, later known as the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; (&quot;economic miracle&quot;).

== Actions taken under JCS 1067 ==
In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production; the maximum allowed was set at about 25% of the prewar production level. Steel plants thus made redundant were dismantled. Also as a consequence of the Potsdam Conference, the occupation forces of all nations were obliged to ensure that German standards of living could not exceed the average level of European neighbors with which it had been at war, France in particular. Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known in 1932. The first &quot;level of industry&quot; plan, signed in 1946, stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the closing of 1,500 manufacturing plants.

On 2 February 1946, a dispatch from Berlin reported:
By 28 February 1947, it was estimated that 4,160,000 German former prisoners of war, by General Dwight D. Eisenhower relabeled as Disarmed Enemy Forces in order to negate the Geneva Convention, were used as forced labor by the various Allied countries to work in camps outside Germany: 3,000,000 in Russia, 750,000 in France, 400,000 in Britain, and 10,000 in Belgium. Meanwhile in Germany, large parts of the population were starving, at a time when according to a study done by former US President Herbert Hoover the nutritional condition in countries in Western Europe was nearly pre-war normal. German prisoners engaged in dangerous tasks, such as clearing mine fields.

A draft report from The President&#x27;s Economic Mission to Germany and Austria stated:
All armaments plants, including some that could have been converted to civilian operation, were dismantled or destroyed. A large proportion of operational civilian plants were dismantled and transported to the victorious nations, mainly France and Russia. As Germany was allowed neither airplane production nor any shipbuilding capacity to supply a merchant navy, all facilities of this type were destroyed over a period of several years. A typical example of this activity by the allies was the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg, where explosive demolition was still taking place as late as 1949. Everything that could not be dismantled was blown up or otherwise destroyed. A small-scale attempt to revive the company in 1948 ended with the owners and a number of employees being thrown in jail by the British. It was not until 1953 that the situation gradually started to improve for Blohm &amp; Voss, thanks in part to repeated pleas by German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to the Allied High Commissioners.

Early US plans for &quot;industrial disarmament&quot; included detaching the Saarland and the Ruhr from Germany in order to remove much of the remaining industrial potential. As late as March 1947 there were still active plans to let France annex the Ruhr, noted by Charles P. Kindleberger of the United States Department of State, who said: &quot;The Times&#x27; article and editorial on the breach in the U.S. ranks on the subject of the Ruhr were accurate, and the latter excellent. I have been disturbed over the arena in which the debate has been carried out. Clay and Draper claim that Germany will go communist shortly after any proposal to infringe on its sovereignty over the Ruhr is carried out.&quot; The Saar Protectorate, another important source of coal and industry for Germany, was likewise to be lost by the Germans. It was cut out from Germany and its resources put under French control. In 1955, the French, under pressure from West Germany and her newfound allies, held a plebiscite in the Saar Protectorate on the question of reunification or independence. Reunification won overwhelmingly, and on January 1, 1957, it rejoined West Germany as the state of Saarland.

Timber exports from the US occupation zone were particularly heavy. Sources in the US government stated that the purpose of this was the &quot;ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests&quot;. As a consequence of the practiced clear-felling, extensive deforestation resulted which could &quot;be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century&quot;.

In addition to the physical barriers that had to be overcome, for the German economic recovery there were also intellectual challenges. The Allies confiscated intellectual property of great value, all German patents both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies. Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the US pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel comes to the conclusion, in his book &quot;Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany&quot;, that the &quot;intellectual reparations&quot; taken by the US and the UK amounted to close to $10 billion. During the more than two years that this policy was in place, no industrial research in Germany could take place without any results being automatically available to overseas competitors who were encouraged by the occupation authorities to access all records and facilities. Meanwhile, thousands of the best German researchers were being put to work in the Soviet Union (Operation Osoaviakhim) and in the UK and US (see also Operation Paperclip).

In 1949, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer wrote to the Allies requesting that the policy of industrial dismantling end, citing the inherent contradiction between encouraging industrial growth and removing factories and also the unpopularity of the policy.

In 1953, it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971. In a largely symbolic 2004 resolution by the lower house of the Polish Parliament, reparations of $640 billion were demanded from Germany, mainly as a weapon in an ongoing argument regarding German property claims on formerly German territory. However, at the Potsdam Conference the Soviet Union undertook to settle the reparation claims of Poland from its own share of reparations from Germany. In 1953 Poland agreed to forego further reparations claims against Germany. Meanwhile, Poland was now in possession of almost a quarter of pre-war German territory, including the important industrial centers in Silesia and the richest coal fields in Europe. In addition, many ethnic Germans living within the Polish pre-war borders were, for years prior to their expulsion, used as forced labor in camps such as that run by Salomon Morel, Central Labour Camp Jaworzno, Central Labour Camp Potulice, Łambinowice, Zgoda labor camp and others.

== Historical assessments ==
Historical assessments differ with regard to the nature, duration and effects of Morgenthau&#x27;s plan and JCS 1067 on American and Allied policies. US diplomat James Dobbins writes that an early draft of JCS 1067 had been written while the plan was still understood to be US policy, and &quot;[b]ecause nothing replaced the Morgenthau plan once it had been disavowed, the final version of JCS 1067 contained many of the harsh measures and all the intent of a hard peace toward Germany&quot;. However, according to Dobbins, in May 1945 – shortly after its approval in April 1945 – the newly appointed deputy military governor, General Clay, implied that the directive was unworkable and initially wanted it to be revised; after the deliberate loopholes were pointed out to him, General Clay did not press further for a revision but &quot;took great liberties in interpreting and implementing JCS 1067&quot;. Clay&#x27;s well-intentioned effort did meet obstacles, like General Marshall forbidding him from relaxing the strict non-fraternization policy to a more reasonable level. Dobbins remarks that the harsh punitive measures shifted toward reform over time as the US faced the problem of feeding millions of Germans and the Soviet expansion. 

 mentions that the American military government was, until 1947, operating under JCS 1067, which he describes as &quot;a framework that had its origin in the Morgenthau Plan&quot;. also mentions that,
 talks of the policy of &quot;Never again a strong Germany!&quot; that found its expression in the infamous JCS 1067 (which was influenced by the Morgenthau Plan), but this principle was abandoned by the USA soon after the Potsdam Conference, though it was not until 1947 that JCS 1067 was replaced by JCS 1779 and its related &quot;European Recovery Program&quot;. Kindleberger describes this time:
In May 1946, General Clay&#x27;s stop-order on the dismantling of plants (for reparations) marked the first open recognition of the failure of Potsdam. After 1947, when conflicting policies began to be reconciled, economic and social conditions began to be improved.

Henry Burke Wend refers to JCS 1067, as approved on 14 May 1945, as a compromise document which, &quot;together with Truman&#x27;s ascension to the presidency [on 12 April 1945], spelled the demise of the Morgenthau Plan&quot;. Despite this, &quot;denazification, deconcentration and dismantling had a profound, if varied, impact on German industrial recovery&quot;. Even with the introduction of the Marshall Plan, self-defeating policies that simultaneously industrialized Germany (by investing billions of dollars) and deindustrialized it (through heavy dismantling of its industry) continued until 1948–1949. Walter M. Hudson describes JCS 1067 as less harsh than Morgenthau&#x27;s plan: while core elements of the Morgenthau Plan were incorporated in JCS 1067, it was deliberately diluted, and permitted the military government to be more flexible than envisaged by the Morgenthau Plan.

The German Federal Agency for Civic Education (BPD) asserts that the Morgenthau Plan was never implemented and was only briefly supported by Roosevelt, and that JCS 1067, while treating Germany as a defeated enemy state instead of a liberated nation and aiming at the dismantling of German industries, also left loopholes that allowed a military governor to later implement more lenient policies. The agency states that the purpose of JCS 1779, which replaced JCS 1067, was to increase German self-government at the regional level, limit dismantling of war industries, raise living standards, and remove dependence on subsidies.

German historian talks of the failure of Morgenthau and the backward-looking political minority that supported him, stating that by the end of 1945 Morgenthau&#x27;s staff had returned to the USA despondent, and those then in charge were not interested in &quot;industrial disarmament&quot;. However, according to Greiner, the &quot;Morgenthau myth&quot; () was perpetuated in West Germany by right-wing extremist historians echoing Nazi propaganda and railing against an &quot;extermination plan&quot; for Germany by Jews and the left-wing intelligentsia in America, while in Communist East Germany the Morgenthau Plan was presented as a western imperialist plot to destroy Germany.

Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at Technische Universität Berlin, states that the plan had no significance for the later occupation and Germany policy, though Nazi propaganda on the subject had a lasting effect and is still used for propaganda purposes by extreme right-wing organizations. Benz also states that Morgenthau had romantic agrarianist ideals which might mean that the intentions of his plan could have been beyond preventing conflicts. German historian Rainer Gömmel criticizes the common claim by historians, including Benz, that the Morgenthau Plan was never implemented, arguing that core elements of the plan, namely the proposals for deindustrialization, were adopted in August 1945 and became part of Allied policy.

A number of historians considered the possibility that Morgenthau may have been influenced by Harry Dexter White, an alleged Soviet agent based on Venona evidence, to develop the Morgenthau Plan – as the weakening of industry in Western Allied occupied territory would be beneficial to the Soviet Union&#x27;s campaign for influence in postwar Germany. The hypothesis is based on White&#x27;s previous pro-Soviet actions such as advocating virtually unlimited Soviet printing of AM-Marks which transferred wealth to East Germany. Critics of the hypothesis, such as historian James C. Van Hook, state that the Morgenthau Plan rejected reparations that were part of official Soviet demands, and Harry Dexter White&#x27;s other economic initiatives at Bretton Woods were so in favor of postwar capitalism that it is difficult to see him as entirely a Soviet agent.

The relevant volume of the British official history of the Second World War states that the Morgenthau Plan &quot;exercised little influence upon Allied policy after the Potsdam Conference ... where more realistic views were adopted&quot;. The history argues, though, that prior to the conference the plan &quot;disastrously bedevilled much military government planning&quot; and led to an ill-judged hardening of Allied plans for occupied Germany as well as disagreements between the US and British governments.

<doc id="285300" wikidata="Q904646" url="?curid=285300" title="Qanun (instrument)">
<text>The qanun, kanun, ganoun or kanoon (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) is a Middle Eastern string instrument played either solo, or more often as part of an ensemble, in much of Iran, Arab East, and Arab Maghreb region of North Africa, later it reached West Africa, Central Asia due to Arab migration. It was also common in ancient (and modern-day) Armenia, and Greece. The name derives ultimately from Ancient Greek: κανών kanōn, meaning &quot;rule, law, norm, principle&quot;. The qanun traces one of its origins to a stringed Assyrian instrument from the Old Assyrian Empire, specifically from the nineteenth century BC in Mesopotamia. This instrument came inscribed on a box of elephant ivory found in the old Assyrian capital Nimrud (ancient name: &quot;Caleh&quot;). The instrument is a type of large zither with a thin trapezoidal soundboard that is famous for its unique melodramatic sound.

==Regional variants and technical specifications==
Arabic qanuns are usually constructed with five skin insets that support a single long bridge resting on five arching pillars, whereas the somewhat smaller Turkish qanuns are based on just four. This allows Arabic variants of the instrument to have more room for the installation of extreme bass and treble strings. Kanuns manufactured in Turkey generally feature 26 courses of strings, with three strings per course in the case of all regional variants. Contemporary Arabic designs use Nylon or PVF strings that are stretched over the bridge poised on fish-skins as described on one end, and attached to wooden tuning pegs at the other end.

Ornamental sound holes called &quot;kafes&quot; are a critical component of what constitutes the accustomed timbre of qanun. However, they normally occupy different locations on the soundboard of Turkish kanuns compared to Arabic qanuns, and may also vary in shape, size and number depending on geography or personal taste.

The dimensions of a Turkish kanun are typically 95 to 100 cm (37–39&quot;) in length, 38 to 40 cm (15–16&quot;) in width, and 4 to 6 cm (1.5–2.3&quot;) in height. In contrast, an Arabic qanun measures a bit larger as mentioned.

Qanun is played on the lap while sitting or squatting, or sometimes on trestle support, by plucking the strings with two tortoise-shell picks (one for each hand) or with fingernails, and has a standard range of three and a half octaves from A2 to E6 that can be extended down to F2 and up to G6 in the case of Arabic designs.

The instrument also features special metallic levers or latches under each course called &quot;mandals&quot;. These small levers, which can be raised or lowered quickly by the performer while the instrument is being played, serve to slightly change the pitch of a particular course by altering effective string lengths.

==Tuning and temperament==
On the regular diatonically tuned qanun, &quot;mandal&quot; technology was first implemented, according to Turkish musicologist Rauf Yekta, some 30 years prior to his submission of his invited monograph on Turkish Music to the 1922 edition of Albert Lavignac&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie de la Musique et Dictionnaire du Conservatoire&quot;. Levantine qanuns, prior to that time, remained rather inflexible and cumbersome to perform on (especially as demanding modulations/transpositions came into vogue that were increasingly emulating Western tonality and key changes), requiring the player to use the fingernail of the thumb to depress on the leftmost ends of the courses to achieve on-the-fly intervallic alterations.

With the advent of electronic tuners some decades later, standardization of the placement of &quot;reference mandals&quot; on the qanun began. While Armenian kanuns now employ only equidistant half-tones and Arabic qanuns exact quarter-tones as a result, Turkish kanun-makers went so far as dividing the electroacoustically referenced equal-tempered semitone of 100 cents into 6 equal parts, yielding – for all intents and purposes – 72 equal divisions (or commas) of the octave pitch resolution. Not all pitches of 72-tone equal temperament are available on the Turkish kanun, however, since kanun-makers affix mandals that only accommodate modulations/transpositions popularly demanded by performers. This has subsequently led to the familiar interrupted and irregular pattern of mandals on the Turkish kanun becoming a visual guide for players, in facilitating modal and intonational navigation on an instrument which is ordinarily bereft of pitch markers. Some kanun-makers may also choose to divide the semitone distance from the nut of the lower registers into 7 parts instead for microtonal subtlety (and the highest registers, conversely, into 5 parts due to spacing constraints); but do so at the expense of octave equivalences. Despite the mentioned discrepancies, hundreds of mandal configurations are at the player&#x27;s disposal when performing on an ordinary Turkish kanun.

On the other hand, the nowadays widespread application of equidistant 24-tones on Arabic and 72-tones on Turkish qanun models presents an ongoing source of controversy. This is particularly in regards to how adequate such Eurocentric octave divisions are in faithfully reproducing the traditionally or classically understood fluid pitches and inflexions of Arabic music or Ottoman classical music scales. Pitch measurement analyses of relevant audio recordings reveal that, equal temperaments based on bike-chained &quot;multiples of twelve&quot; are essentially not compatible with authentic Middle Eastern performances; substantiating the notion instruments strictly based on them would clash audibly with a justly tuned/intoned tanbur, oud, ney, or kemenche.

Alternate tuning approaches for the qanun thus also exist. Turkish music theorist Ozan Yarman has proposed, for example, an academical 79-tone temperament for the expression within tolerable error-margins of Maqamat / Makamlar / Dastgaha at all pitch levels, that was implemented by the renowned late luthier Ejder Güleç (1939–2014) on a Turkish kanun. Likewise, the late Swiss-French qānūn performer Julien Jalâl Ed-Dine Weiss (1953–2015), who was critical of the tuning deficiency of Eurocentric octave divisions in approximating just intervals, is known to have conceived, since 1990, a number of prototypes that were entirely based on low prime-limit or simple integer ratio Pythagorean and harmonic intervals; which were once again built, on instructions from Weiss, by Ejder Güleç.

<text>Lytchett Minster is a village in Dorset, England. It lies around north-west of Poole town centre. The village forms part of the civil parish of Lytchett Minster and Upton, Upton now being a suburb of Poole.

==Etymology==
The name of Lytchett Minster is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Lichet&quot;. This name comes from the Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;grey&quot;) and (&quot;wood&quot;). The name is first attested with addition of &quot;Minster&quot; in 1244, in forms such as &quot;Licheminster&quot;. This was used to distinguish the settlement from Lytchett Matravers and arose because the estate was a chapelry of the minster Sturminster Marshall.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Lytchett Minster lies on low-lying farmland around west of the Poole district of Upton, southeast of the village of Lytchett Matravers, and 1.2 miles east-northeast of Organford. To the northeast are Lytchett Heath, Beacon Hill and Upton Heath; to the southwest are Gore Heath and Holton Heath. The A35 dual carriageway bypasses the village to the east and south.

== History and culture ==
Lytchett Minster is home to a number of manor houses, one of which now hosts the local secondary school.

=== South Lytchett Manor ===
In 1890 Baronet and MP Sir Elliott Lees bought land in Dorset and moved into South Lytchett Manor. The Manor was requisitioned in WW2, serving as the battery headquarters of an anti-aircraft defence regiment. After Sir John Lees&#x27; death in 1955, his heir, Sir Thomas Lees, decided to sell rather than renovate, and the Lees family moved to Post Green House, then a farmhouse on the estate. It was bought by the local Council and became Lytchett Minster Secondary Modern School, now Lytchett Minster School.

=== Post Green ===
In July 1942 Lieutenant Colonel Sir Francis Younghusband, explorer and spiritual writer, suffered a stroke. He then retired to Post Green House, as a guest of Lady Madeline Lees, where he died shortly after. He was buried in the village churchyard.

Lady Madeline Lees (née Pelly) was a passionate Christian with a desire to communicate the story of Jesus. After the local school Nativity play for many years, she decided it was time to produce something that could be shown around the world. So she roped in the whole village as actors, retired actor Gerald Rawlinson as a narrator, plus extras from Poole, Upton and other villages to create two successful amateur religious films, &quot;A Voice Crying in the Wilderness&quot; (1958) and &quot;Messiah&quot;, released in 1960.

In the mid-1960s, Sir Thomas Lees and his wife, Lady Faith, started offering hospitality to people in need, accommodating up to 25 people at a time in their home and later expanding this community support using local homes they owned, to form the Post Green Community. The Post Green Community organized camps, retreats and seminars that attracted Christians from all over UK and abroad. It was associated with David Watson, Graham Pulkingham and the Charismatic movement, while remaining under the umbrella of the Church of England.

Sir Tom, realising how precious the land at Holton was, turned down a multi-million pound offer from a developer and designated it for charitable use as the East Holton Charity, renamed Holton Lee in 1992, had charitable trust status to develop an environmental and arts centre for disabled people. Since 2015 the charity has been taken over by UK charity Livability.

<text>Ubuntu () (meaning &quot;humanity&quot; in some Bantu languages, such as Zulu) describes a set of closely related Bantu African-origin value systems that emphasize the interconnectedness of individuals with their surrounding societal and physical worlds. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is sometimes translated as &quot;I am because we are&quot; (also &quot;I am because you are&quot;), or &quot;humanity towards others&quot; (Zulu &quot;&quot;). In Xhosa, the latter term is used, but is often meant in a more philosophical sense to mean &quot;the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity&quot;.

==Different names in other Bantu languages==

Although the most popular term referring to the philosophy today is &quot;ubuntu&quot; (Zulu language, South Africa), the philosophy is believed to stretch back to the beginning of proto-Bantu language and has many other names in other Bantu languages.

It is also found in other Bantu countries not mentioned here.

==Definitions==
There are various definitions of the word &quot;Ubuntu&quot;. The most recent definition was provided by the &quot;African Journal of Social Work&quot; (&quot;AJSW&quot;). The journal defined &quot;Ubuntu&quot; as:

There are many different (and not always compatible) definitions of what Ubuntu is. Even with the various definitions, Ubuntu encompasses the interdependence of humans on one another and the acknowledgment of one&#x27;s responsibility to their fellow humans and the world around them. It is a philosophy that supports collectivism over individualism. 

Ubuntu asserts that society gives human beings their humanity. An example is a Zulu-speaking person who when commanding to speak in Zulu would say &quot;khuluma isintu&quot;, which means &quot;speak the language of people&quot;. When someone behaves according to custom, a Sotho-speaking person would say &quot;ke motho&quot;, which means &quot;he/she is a human&quot;. The aspect of this that would be exemplified by a tale told (often, in private quarters) in Nguni &quot;&quot;kushone abantu ababili ne Shangaan&quot;, in Sepedi &quot;go tlhokofetje batho ba babedi le leShangane&quot;&quot;, in English (two people died and one Shangaan). In each of these examples, humanity comes from conforming to or being part of the tribe.

According to Michael Onyebuchi Eze, the core of Ubuntu can best be summarised as follows:

&quot;A person is a person through other people&quot; strikes an affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an &quot;other&quot; in his or her uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative intersubjective formation in which the &quot;other&quot; becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each other and need to sustain this &quot;otherness&quot; creation. And if we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: &quot;we are because you are, and since you are, definitely I am&quot;. The &quot;I am&quot; is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution dependent on this &quot;otherness&quot; creation of relation and distance.

An &quot;extroverted communities&quot; aspect is the most visible part of this ideology. There is sincere warmth with which people treat both strangers and members of the community. This overt display of warmth is not merely aesthetic but enables the formation of spontaneous communities. The resultant collaborative work within these spontaneous communities transcends the aesthetic and gives functional significance to the value of warmth. Warmth is not the sine qua non of community formation but guards against instrumentalist relationships. Unfortunately, sincere warmth may leave one vulnerable to those with ulterior motives.

&quot;Ubuntu&quot; as political philosophy encourages community equality, propagating the distribution of wealth. This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, have a vested interest in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued, however, that this idea of &quot;collective responsibility&quot; must not be understood as absolute in which the community&#x27;s good is prior to the individual&#x27;s good. On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a community&#x27;s good through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of individual uniqueness and difference. Audrey Tang has suggested that Ubuntu &quot;implies that everyone has different skills and strengths; people are not isolated, and through mutual support they can help each other to complete themselves.&quot;

&quot;Redemption&quot; relates to how people deal with errant, deviant, and dissident members of the community. The belief is that man is born formless like a lump of clay. It is up to the community, as a whole, to use the fire of experience and the wheel of social control to mould him into a pot that may contribute to society. Any imperfections should be borne by the community and the community should always seek to redeem man. An example of this is the statement by the African National Congress (in South Africa) that it does not throw out its own but rather redeems.

Other scholars such as Mboti (2015) argue that the normative definition of Ubuntu, notwithstanding its intuitive appeal, is still open to doubt. The definition of Ubuntu, contends Mboti, has remained consistently and purposely fuzzy, inadequate and inconsistent. Mboti rejects the interpretation that Africans are &quot;naturally&quot; interdependent and harmony-seeking, and that humanity is given to a person by and through other persons. He sees a philosophical trap in attempts to elevate harmony to a moral duty – a sort of categorical imperative – that Africans must simply uphold. Mboti cautions against relying on intuitions in attempts to say what Ubuntu is or is not. He concludes that the phrase &quot;umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu&quot; references a messier, undisciplined relationship between persons, stating that: &quot;First, there is value in regarding a broken relationship as being authentically human as much as a harmonious relationship. Second, a broken relationship can be as ethically desirable as a harmonious one. For instance, freedom follows from a break from oppression. Finally, harmonious relations can be as oppressive and false as disharmonious ones. For instance, the cowboy and his horse are in a harmonious relationship.&quot;

==Ubuntu maxims or short statements==

Ubuntu is often presented in short statements called maxims by Samkange (1980). Some of these are:
* &quot;Motho ke motho ka batho&quot; (Sotho/Tswana). A person is a person through other people.
* &quot;Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu&quot; (Zulu). A person is a person through other people.
* &quot;Umntu ngumntu ngabantu&quot; (Xhosa). A person is a person through other people.
* &quot;Munhu munhu nevanhu&quot; (Shona). A person through other people.
* &quot;Ndiri nekuti tiri&quot; (Shona). I am because we are.
* &quot;Munhu i munhu hivanwani vanhu&quot; (Xitsonga). A person is a person through other people.
* &quot;Muthu ndi muthu nga vhathu&quot; (Venda). A person is a person through other people.

==History of the concept in African written sources==
Ubuntu has been in existence in orature (oral literature) and in the culture of Bantu peoples. It appeared in South African written sources from as early as the mid-19th century. Reported translations covered the semantic field of &quot;human nature, humanness, humanity; virtue, goodness, kindness&quot;. Grammatically, the word combines the root &quot;-ntʊ̀&quot; &quot;person, human being&quot; with the class 14 &quot;ubu-&quot; prefix forming abstract nouns, so that the term is exactly parallel in formation to the abstract noun &quot;humanity&quot;.

The concept was popularised in terms of a &quot;philosophy&quot; or &quot;world view&quot; (as opposed to a quality attributed to an individual) beginning in the 1950s, notably in the writings of Jordan Kush Ngubane published in the &quot;African Drum&quot; magazine. From the 1970s, the &quot;ubuntu&quot; began to be described as a specific kind of &quot;African humanism&quot;. Based on the context of Africanisation propagated by the political thinkers in the 1960s period of decolonisation, &quot;ubuntu&quot; was used as a term for a specifically African (or Southern African) kind of humanism found in the context of the transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe and South Africa.

The first publication dedicated to &quot;ubuntu&quot; as a philosophical concept appeared in 1980, &quot;Hunhuism or Ubuntuism: A Zimbabwe Indigenous Political Philosophy&quot; (&quot;hunhu&quot; being the Shona equivalent of Nguni &quot;ubuntu&quot;) by Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange. Hunhuism or Ubuntuism is presented as political ideology for the new Zimbabwe, as Southern Rhodesia attained independence from the United Kingdom.

The concept was used in South Africa in the 1990s as a guiding ideal for the transition from apartheid to majority rule. The term appears in the Epilogue of the Interim Constitution of South Africa (1993): &quot;there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for &quot;ubuntu&quot; but not for victimisation&quot;.

In South Africa, it has come to be used as a contested term for a kind of humanist philosophy, ethic, or ideology, also known as Ubuntuism propagated in the Africanisation (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s. New research has begun to question the exclusive &quot;humanism&quot; framing, and thus to suggest that &quot;ubuntu&quot; can have a &quot;militaristic&quot; angle – an &quot;ubuntu&quot; for warriors.

In Uganda the term is used in people&#x27;s everyday language as a way to relate to one another and call for community. The term can also be used to criticize another&#x27;s actions if one states that they have lost &quot;Obuuntu&quot; (their humanity).

Since the transition to democracy in South Africa with the Nelson Mandela presidency in 1994, the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularised to English-language readers through the ubuntu theology of Desmond Tutu. Tutu was the chairman of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), and many have argued that &quot;ubuntu&quot; was a formative influence on the TRC.

== By country ==

===Zimbabwe===

In the Shona language, the majority spoken language in Zimbabwe, ubuntu is &quot;unhu&quot; or &quot;hunhu&quot;. In Ndebele, it is known as ubuntu. The concept of ubuntu is viewed the same in Zimbabwe as in other African cultures. The Shona phrase &quot;munhu munhu nekuda kwevanhu&quot; means a person is human through others while &quot;ndiri nekuti tiri&quot; means I am because we are.

Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange (1980) highlights the three maxims of Hunhuism or Ubuntuism that shape this philosophy: The first maxim asserts that &#x27;To be human is to affirm one&#x27;s humanity by recognizing the humanity of others and, on that basis, establish respectful human relations with them.&#x27; And &#x27;the second maxim means that if and when one is faced with a decisive choice between wealth and the preservation of the life of another human being, then one should opt for the preservation of life&#x27;. The third &#x27;maxim&#x27; as a &#x27;principle deeply embedded in traditional African political philosophy&#x27; says &#x27;that the king owed his status, including all the powers associated with it, to the will of the people under him&#x27;.

===South Africa===
Ubuntu: &quot;I am what I am because of who we all are.&quot; (From a definition offered by Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee.)

Archbishop Desmond Tutu offered a definition in a 1999 book:
Tutu further explained Ubuntu in 2008:.
Nelson Mandela explained Ubuntu as follows:
Tim Jackson refers to Ubuntu as a philosophy that supports the changes he says are necessary to create a future that is economically and environmentally sustainable. Judge Colin Lamont expanded on the definition during his ruling on the hate speech trial of Julius Malema.

At Nelson Mandela&#x27;s memorial, United States President Barack Obama spoke about Ubuntu, saying,

===Malawi===
In Malawi, the same philosophy is called &quot;uMunthu&quot; in the local Chewa language. According to the Catholic Diocese of Zomba bishop Rt. Rev. Fr. Thomas Msusa, &quot;The African worldview is about living as one family, belonging to God&quot;. Msusa noted that in Africa &quot;We say &#x27;I am because we are&#x27;, or in Chichewa &quot;kali kokha nkanyama, tili awiri ntiwanthu&quot; (when you are on your own you are as good as an animal of the wild; when there are two of you, you form a community).&quot;

The philosophy of uMunthu has been passed on through proverbs such as &quot;Mwana wa mnzako ngwako yemwe, ukachenjera manja udya naye&quot; (your neighbor&#x27;s child is your own, his/her success is your success too). Some notable Malawian uMunthu philosophers and intellectuals who have written about this worldview are Augustine Musopole, Gerard Chigona, Chiwoza Bandawe, Richard Tambulasi, Harvey Kwiyani and Happy Kayuni. This includes Malawian philosopher and theologist Harvey Sindima’s treatment of uMunthu as an important African philosophy is highlighted in his 1995 book &quot;Africa’s Agenda: The legacy of liberalism and colonialism in the crisis of African values&quot;. In film, the English translation of the proverb lent its hand to forming the title of Madonna&#x27;s 2008 documentary, &quot;I Am Because We Are&quot;, about Malawian orphans.

== Applications ==

=== In diplomacy ===
In June 2009, in her swearing-in remarks as US Department of State Special Representative for Global Partnerships, Global Partnership Initiative, Office of the Secretary of State, Elizabeth Frawley Bagley discussed ubuntu in the context of American foreign policy, stating: &quot;In understanding the responsibilities that come with our interconnectedness, we realize that we must rely on each other to lift our World from where it is now to where we want it to be in our lifetime, while casting aside our worn out preconceptions, and our outdated modes of statecraft.&quot; She then introduced the notion of &quot;Ubuntu Diplomacy&quot; with the following words:

=== In education ===
In education, Ubuntu has been used to guide and promote African education, and to decolonise it from Western educational philosophies. Ubuntu education uses the family, community, society, environment and spirituality as sources of knowledge but also as teaching and learning media. The essence of education is family, community, societal and environmental well-being. Ubuntu education is about learners becoming critical about their social conditions. Interaction, participation, recognition, respect and inclusion are important aspects of ubuntu education. Methods of teaching and learning include groups and community approaches. The objectives, content, methodology and outcomes of education are shaped by Ubuntu.

=== In social work, welfare and development ===
This refers to Afrocentric ways of providing a social safety net to vulnerable members of society. Common elements include collectivity. The approach helps to &quot;validate worldview and traditions suppressed by Western Eurocentric cultural hegemony&quot;. It is against materialism and individualism. It looks at an individual person as holistically. The social interventions done by social workers, welfare workers and development workers should strengthen, not weaken families, communities, society, the environment and peoples&#x27;s spirituality. These are the five pillars of ubuntu intervention: family, community, society, environment and spirituality. Ubuntu is the current theme for the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development and represents the highest level of global messaging within social work profession for the years 2020–2030. Utilising the biopsychosocial and ecological system approaches, ubuntu is a philosophy that is applicable in clinical social work in mental health.

=== In research ===
Ubuntu can guide research objectives, ethics and methodology. Using ubuntu research approach provides researchers with an African oriented tool that decolonises research agenda and methodology. The objectives of ubuntu research are to empower families, communities and society at large. In doing ubuntu research, the position of the researcher is important because it helps create research relationships. The agenda of the research belongs to the community, and true participation is highly valued. &quot;&quot; is valued, it means pulling together or collaboration.

=== In moral philosophy ===
According to this philosophy, &quot;actions are right roughly insofar as they are a matter of living harmoniously with others or honouring communal relationships&quot;, &quot;One&#x27;s ultimate goal should be to become a full person, a real self or a genuine human being&quot;. &quot;&quot;, i.e. relationships are important. Among the Shona people, for example, when a person dies, his or her property is shared amongst relatives and there are culturally approved ways of doing this. The practice is called &quot;&quot;. Samkange (1980)&#x27;s maxim on morality says &quot;If and when one is faced with a decisive choice between wealth and the preservation of the life of another human being, then one should opt for the preservation of life&quot;.

=== In politics and leadership ===
Samkange (1980) said no foreign political philosophy can be useful in a country more than the indigenous philosophies. &quot;Is there a philosophy or ideology indigenous to (a) country that can serve its people just as well, if not better than, foreign ideologies?&quot;, asked Samkange in the book &quot;Hunhuism or Ubuntuism&quot;. His maxim for leadership is &quot;The king owes his status, including all the powers associated with it, to the will of the people under him&quot;.

=== In social justice, criminal justice and jurisprudence ===
Ubuntu justice has elements different from western societies: it values repairing relationships. Ubuntu justice emphasises these elements:
# Deterrence which can be done socially, physically, economically or spiritually
# Returning and Replacement – meaning bring back what has been stolen, replacing it or compensating. In Shona language this is called &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;
# Apology, Forgiveness and Reconciliation (restoration of &quot;&quot; or relations) after meeting the above
# Warnings and Punishments (retribution) from leaders and elders if the above have not been achieved or ignored
# Warnings and Punishments from spiritual beings if the above have not been met. In Shona culture, these are called &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;

Families, and at times community are involved in the process of justice.

African scholars have noted that while some elements of Ubuntu are liberating to women, others &quot;marginalize and disempower&quot; them, and &quot;can be seen as engendering patriarchy&quot;.

Ubuntu has also been associated with restorative justice. Some scholars have argued that restorative justice practices are embedded in the Ubuntu philosophy which shares similarities with their philosophy, values and practices. Within the restorative justice context, ubuntu is understood as African humanism, a philosophy, an ethic, and as a worldview. The underlying restorative justice value of power sharing is very much aligned with the Ubuntu philosophy which &quot;sees&quot; the other through their humanity.

==In popular culture==

Ubuntu was a major theme in John Boorman&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;In My Country&quot;. Former US president Bill Clinton used the term at the 2006 Labour Party conference in the UK to explain why society is important.

The Boston Celtics, the 2008 NBA champions, have chanted &quot;ubuntu&quot; when breaking a huddle since the start of the 2007–2008 season. The first episode of the 2020 Netflix docuseries &quot;The Playbook&quot; shows how Boston Celtic&#x27;s coach, Glenn Anton &quot;Doc&quot; Rivers learned of the Ubuntu philosophy. The documentary then explores the impact of the philosophy on the team members and how it became their guiding principle.

At the 2002 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), there was an Ubuntu Village exposition centre. Ubuntu was the theme of the 76th General Convention of the American Episcopal Church. The logo includes the text &quot;I in You and You in Me&quot;.

First released in October 2004, a prominent computer software package is called the Ubuntu operating system. The operating system development was led by Mark Shuttleworth, a South African entrepreneur and owner of the UK-based company Canonical Ltd.

In film, the English translation of the proverb was used for the title of pop singer Madonna&#x27;s 2008 documentary film &quot;I Am Because We Are&quot; about Malawian orphans. An accompanying book of the same name was published in 2009.

A character in the 2008 animated comedy &quot;The Goode Family&quot; is named Ubuntu Goode.

Ubuntu was the title and theme of an EP released by British band Clockwork Radio in 2012.

Ubuntu was the title of an EP released by American rapper Sage Francis in 2012.

Ubuntu was chosen as the name of a clan of meerkats in the 2021 season of &quot;Meerkat Manor: Rise of the Dynasty&quot;.

<text>Sondra Gotlieb (née Kaufman; 30 December 1936 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian journalist and novelist who lives in Toronto, Ontario.

She married Allan Gotlieb, Canadian ambassador to the United States during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Her book &quot;Washington Rollercoaster&quot; recounted the Gotliebs&#x27; years as glamorous hosts in Washington during the Reagan Era, when she wrote a much-read column for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine called her a &quot;sparkling hostess&quot;, and in Washington she quickly became known for her irreverent attitude and sharp tongue. She often attracted attention with remarks considered out-of-character for diplomatic wives. Referring to Canada&#x27;s image in America as a dull northern neighbour, she remarked: &quot;Maybe we should invade South Dakota&quot;.

In 1986, she attracted a blaze of international publicity when reporter Juliet O&#x27;Neill caught her slapping her social secretary Connie Gibson Connors at an official dinner she and her husband were hosting in honour of the Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and U.S. Vice-President George H. W. Bush. The incident, while criticized, made her one of the most talked-about women in Washington, and invitations to the Gotliebs&#x27; parties became highly coveted. 

After she and her husband returned to Canada in the early 1990s, they moved to Toronto&#x27;s exclusive Rosedale neighbourhood and became the centre of establishment society in that city. Allan joined numerous corporate boards, including Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger Inc., while Sondra began writing columns for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and later the &quot;National Post&quot;, which was owned by Conrad Black.

She won the Stephen Leacock Prize for her 1978 novel, &quot;True Confections&quot;, which was subtitled, &quot;Or How My Family Arranged My Marriage&quot;.

In 2001, she alluded to the infamous &quot;Slap Flap&quot; incident in a series of articles about her recent facelift, published in the &quot;National Post&quot;. Gotlieb recounted how the idea for cosmetic surgery first came to her after a visit with friends in Washington D.C. &quot;One of them said to me, &#x27;It must be nice living in Toronto. You can slop around without having to bother too much about your appearance. Canadians have such old-fashioned values.&#x27; For the second time in my life I felt like slapping someone&#x27;s face.&quot;

Her regular column in the &quot;National Post&quot; continued until 2015. 

She resides in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale.

==Family==

Sondra Gotlieb (née Kaufman) and husband Allan were married in 1955. They had three children: Rebecca (1958-2003), Marc (born 1959), and Rachel (born 1962).

Rebecca, a lawyer, was married to Keith Ham, also a lawyer, but they separated and divorced a few years after the adoption of son David in 1992. She subsequently married journalist Matthew Fraser, former Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;National Post&quot; and television host. In early 2003, she died suddenly after a recurrence of liver cancer.

Marc, an art historian and former University of Toronto professor, is married to Lauren Freeman. They have three children.

Rachel is married to lawyer Rob Dickson and they have two children. They live in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale.

<text>Ibrahim Abdul Karim al-Eshaiker (; born 25 March 1947), better known as Ibrahim al-Jaafari, is an Iraqi politician who was Prime Minister of Iraq in the Iraqi Transitional Government from 2005 to 2006, following the January 2005 election. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2014 to 2018.

He was one of the two Vice Presidents of Iraq under the Iraqi Interim Government from 2004 to 2005, and he was the main spokesman for the Islamic Dawa Party. He withdrew his nomination for premiership for the permanent government.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Karbala to Shia parents Abd al-Karim al-Eshaiker and Rahmah al-Eshaiker on March 25, 1947. He hails from the noble Al Zheek family that claims descent from Ibrahim al-Asghar bin Musa al-Kadhim, the seventh Shia Imam. The family settled in Karbala in the early 11th-century. His great-grandfather, Mahdi bin Ali bin Baqir al-Eshaiker, led the al-Eshaiker revolt in Karbala in 1876 against the Ottoman Empire. 

al-Jaafari was educated at Mosul university as a medical doctor. He moved with his family to Iran where he lived and worked with the Islamic Revolution Council of Iraq, an Iran backed Iraqi opposition until 1989. He then moved to London where he continued his political activities by eventually heading the Dawa Islamic Party.

==Member of Council of Representatives==
He joined the Islamic Dawa Party in 1968. Upon graduation from school in 1974 he worked actively for the party in Iraq which was trying to overthrow the Ba&#x27;athist secular Sunni-dominated government. He left for Iran in 1980 and became involved in the movement against Saddam Hussein there as part of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq where he represented the Islamic Dawa Party. He adopted the name &quot;al-Jaafari&quot; in exile to protect his family in Iraq from retribution by Saddam. He moved to London in 1989 where he became the al-Dawa spokesman in the UK and an important participant in the wider anti-Saddam movement. While in the UK he attended many Iraqi Events giving religious sermons.

==Iraq War and the fall of Saddam Hussein==

He opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq but returned to Iraq soon after. He was picked in July 2003 as member of the U.S.-backed Iraqi Governing Council, and served as its first chairman and Iraq&#x27;s first post-Saddam interim President for one month. On 1 June 2004, he was selected to be one of the two vice-presidents in the Iraqi Interim Government.

He brought al-Dawa into the United Iraqi Alliance coalition of Shi&#x27;ite parties and was second on the party&#x27;s list after SCIRI leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim.

==Elections==

===January 2005 elections===

Following the January 2005 Iraqi elections the strength of the UIA in the parliament made him a likely candidate to become the nation&#x27;s new Prime Minister. Only Ahmed Chalabi challenged him for the position. Chalabi later dropped out of the race, being less than a favourite for a majority of the parties in the UIA, partly tainted by several scandals, thus leaving al-Jaafari unchallenged to become the alliance&#x27;s candidate for the post. He was designated as Prime Minister on 7 April 2005, following the election of a Presidency Council the day before. After a long period of negotiations aimed at establishing a broad-based government, he and his cabinet were finally approved by the National Assembly of Iraq on 28 April.

===December 2005 elections===
In the national election of December 2005, the UIA once again won the majority of the votes, which according to the new Iraqi constitution, gets to pick the Prime Minister. UIA members voted for the Prime Minister with only two main candidates. Al-Jaafari was one and the SCIRI member Adel Abdul Mahdi, an economist. Jaafari won the vote only by one (64–63). His win was credited to the support of Muqtada Al Sadr&#x27;s members of UIA, who all voted for him.

Despite this win, however, he became increasingly associated with the failure to end the violence in Iraq and to improve services. Because of this, the Sunni, Kurdish and secular groups in the parliament refused to agree to him continuing as Prime Minister, leading to deadlock. His refusal to stand down began to alienate even those who had backed him up to that point, but it is believed that only when Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani intervened that he finally stepped down. The US government had expressed dissatisfaction with him in two months earlier, with George W. Bush stating that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t want, doesn&#x27;t support, doesn&#x27;t accept&quot; his retention as Prime Minister.

He was succeeded by al-Maliki as Dawa Party secretary-general in May 2007.

==National Reform==
In May 2008, al-Jaafari launched a new political party called the National Reform Trend. He was formally expelled from the Dawa party as a consequence, and his new party was widely seen as a vehicle for an attempt at regaining power.

==Appointment as Foreign Minister==

He was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs by newly-elect Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on 8 September 2014.

In February 2018, al-Jaafari condemned the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin. He stated: &quot;We reject any foreign nation from intervening in the affairs of another country.&quot;

<doc id="285319" wikidata="Q1048242" url="?curid=285319" title="Islamic Dawa Party">
<text>The Islamic Dawa Party (), is an Iraqi Shia Islamist political movement that was formed in 1957 by seminarians in Najaf, Iraq, and later formed branches in Lebanon and Kuwait. The Party backed the Iranian Revolution and also Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the Iran–Iraq War. It supported the invasion of Iraq. Iran played a crucial role in the development of the movement, especially its Lebanese branch which later became Hezbollah. In 2019, the Dawa Party was reportedly suffering from internal divisions and is in danger of losing its &quot;political relevance&quot;. The Islamic Dawa Party is led by Nouri Al-Maliki.

==History==
The Dawa party coalesced in the years around 1960 in Shia holy cities in southern Iraq. At the time, its primary goal was to counterbalance the intellectual hold that Marxism and other secular ideologies had on Iraqi Shia. Seminarian Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr quickly emerged as its leading figure and wrote its manifesto, al-Usus, probably in 1960. The group argued for the creation of an Islamic polity and a modern political movement, with a disciplined, cell-based structure inspired by Leninist organizational ideas, to propagate its beliefs. It defined its mission as to &quot;establish an Islamic government and install a ruling apparatus until favorable conditions arise to enable the nation to give its opinion in a referendum.&quot;. Party leaders and scholars have given different dates for the foundation of the movement, with estimates ranging from 1957 through the late 1960s. They also differ on when it adopted its name, when it started to be considered a party, and in which city - Najaf, or Karbala - it was founded.

A twin party was also founded in Lebanon by clerics who had studied in Najaf and supported Muhammad Baqr al-Sadr&#x27;s vision of a resurgent Islam.

Hizb Al-Dawa gained strength in the 1970s recruiting from among the Shi&#x27;a ulama and youth. During the 1970s, the government shut down the Shi&#x27;a journal &quot;Risalat al-Islam&quot; and closed several religious educational institutions. The government passed a law obligating Iraqi students of the hawza to undertake national military service. The Ba&#x27;athists then began specifically targeting Al-Dawa members, arresting and imprisoning them from 1972 onwards. 

In 1973, someone killed the alleged head of Al-Dawa&#x27;s Baghdad branch in prison. 

In 1974, 75 members of the party, were arrested and sentenced to death by the Ba&#x27;athist revolutionary court. This included 5 of the party&#x27;s most preeminent members, who were Shaykh Aref al-Basri, Sayyid Izz al-Din al-Qubanchi, Sayyid Imad al-Din al-Tabatabaei, and the two Fa&#x27;izids, Nuri Tumah, and Husayn Jelokhan. They were sentenced to death in December of that year. 

In 1975, the government canceled the annual procession from Najaf to Karbala, known as marad al-ras. Although subject to repressive measures throughout the 1970s, large-scale opposition to the government by Al-Dawa goes back to the Safar Intifada of February 1977. 

Despite the government&#x27;s ban on the celebration of marad al-ras, Al-Dawa organized the procession in 1977. They were subsequently attacked by police. After this period it also interacted with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the future dictator of Iran, during his exile in Najaf in Iraq.

Widely viewed in the West as a terrorist organization at the time, the Dawa party was banned in 1980 and its members sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council.

===Iranian Islamic Revolution and US Embassy Bombing===
Dawa supported the Islamic Revolution in Iran and in turn received support from the Iranian government. During the Iran–Iraq War, Iran backed a Dawa insurgency against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist government in Iraq. In 1979, Dawa moved its headquarters to Tehran, the capital of Iran. It bombed the Iraqi Embassy in Beirut in December 1981, the first of its international attacks. Dawa party was thought to have been behind the bombing of the US embassy in Kuwait as well as other installations as punishment of Kuwait, America and France&#x27;s military and financial assistance to Iraq in its war against Iran (see 1983 Kuwait bombings). One of those convicted for the bombing was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a member of Iraq&#x27;s parliament and military commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces.

Despite this cooperation, al-Sadr&#x27;s and Khomeini&#x27;s visions of an Islamic Republic differed sharply in certain respects. While Khomeini argued the power of the state should rest with the ulema, Al-Dawa supported the notion of power resting with the ummah, or in other words, the people. This disagreement was one factor that led to the formation of SCIRI as a separate group from Al-Dawa. Al-Dawa claimed to have many Sunni members in the 1980s and coordinated with several Sunni Islamist groups at that stage. On 31 March 1980, the Ba&#x27;athist regime&#x27;s Revolutionary Command Council passed a law sentencing to death all past and present members of the Dawa party, its affiliated organizations, and people working for its goals. This was soon followed by a renewed and relentless purge of alleged and actual party members, with estimates varying on the numbers executed due to the secretive nature of the Iraqi regime.

In the West, Al-Dawa was widely viewed as a terrorist organization during the Iran–Iraq War, especially since the West tended to be more supportive of Iraq during that conflict. It is thought responsible for a host of assassination attempts in Iraq against the president, prime minister and others, as well as attacks against Western and Sunni targets elsewhere. In 1980 it attempted to assassinate Tariq Aziz, Hussein&#x27;s longtime loyalist. In 1982 and 1987 it also attempted to assassinate Saddam Hussein. Following Saddam&#x27;s 2003 overthrow, the former president was ultimately hanged for the Dujail Massacre, the judicial reprisals and torture carried out following a Dawa assassination attempt on himself in 1982.

===Dawa versus Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr in the &#x27;80s===
Tensions between Al-Sadr and Dawa came to light when Al-Sadr forbade his students at the seminary (Hawza) from joining the Dawa party. Amongst the retaliatory steps taken, Dawa switched their allegiance to Abu Al-Qassim Al-Khoei another leading scholar in Najaf.

===1990s===
After the Gulf War, the interests of Al-Dawa and the United States became more closely aligned. The efforts of Al-Dawa representatives and other opponents of Saddam Hussein led to the founding of the Iraqi National Congress, which relied heavily on United States funding. INC&#x27;s political platform promised &quot;human rights and rule of law within a constitutional, democratic, and pluralistic Iraq&quot;. The Dawa Party itself participated in the congress between 1992 and 1995, withdrawing because of disagreements with Kurdish parties over how Iraq should be governed after Hussein&#x27;s eventual ouster.

===2003 American invasion===
Most leaders of Al-Dawa remained in exile in Iran and elsewhere until the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. During this period, some of its factions moved to SCIRI. Al-Dawa Party, took part in the 2002 Iraqi opposition’s London conference in support of the invasion.

=== Recent development ===

The Iraqi Islamic Dawa Party re-elected Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister of Iraq between 2006 and 2014, as its secretary-general in July 2019.

According to Harith Hassan of the Carnegie Middle East Center, Islamic Dawa was Iraq&#x27;s leading party from 2003 to 2018, but during this time &quot;its commitment to building an Islamic state waned and its priorities were shaped increasingly by the challenges of governance and the pursuit of clientelist politics&quot;. It has felt compelled to focus on ethnosectarian (Shia) identity, political patronage, and the division of petroleum export spoils to win support, instead of selling its ideology and political programs to voters. As of 2019, it has become &quot;divided by internal factions&quot; and lost its &quot;political relevance&quot;.

==Ideology==
The political ideology of Al-Dawa is heavily influenced by work done by Baqr al-Sadr, who laid out four mandatory principles of governance in his 1975 work, &quot;Islamic Political System&quot;. These are:

# Absolute sovereignty belongs to God.
# Islamic injunctions are the basis of legislation. The legislative authority may enact any law not repugnant to Islam.
#The people, as vice-regents of Allah, are entrusted with legislative and executive powers.
# The jurist holding religious authority represents Islam. By confirming legislative and executive actions, he gives them legality.

In his Islamic political system, Sadr sought &quot;a balance&quot; between the two forces of &quot;consultation&quot; (&quot;shura&quot;, the role of &quot;the people&quot;) and the oversight role of the ‘ulama, specifically &quot;the jurist holding religious authority represents Islam&quot;. He thought that political control should be 

Upon joining the party, allegiance must be sworn to the party.

<text>Yonge Street ( &quot;&quot;) is a major arterial route in the Canadian province of Ontario connecting the shores of Lake Ontario in Toronto to Lake Simcoe, a gateway to the Upper Great Lakes. Ontario&#x27;s first colonial administrator, John Graves Simcoe, named the street for his friend Sir George Yonge, an expert on ancient Roman roads.

Once the southernmost leg of provincial Highway 11, linking the provincial capital with northern Ontario, Yonge Street has been referred to as &quot;Main Street Ontario&quot;. Until 1999, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; repeated the popular misconception that Yonge Street was long, making it the longest street in the world; this was due to a conflation of Yonge Street with the rest of Ontario&#x27;s Highway 11. The street (including the Bradford-to-Barrie extension) is only long. Due to provincial downgrading in the 1990s, no section of Yonge Street is marked as a provincial highway.

Its construction has been designated as an Event of National Historic Significance in Canada. Yonge Street was integral to the original planning and settlement of western Upper Canada in the 1790s, forming the basis of the concession roads in Ontario today. In Toronto and York Region, Yonge Street is the north–south baseline from which street numbering is reckoned east and west. The eastern branch of the subway Line 1 Yonge–University serves nearly the entire length of the street in Toronto; it serves as the spine of the Toronto subway system, linking to suburban commuter systems such as the Viva Blue BRT. The street is a commercial main thoroughfare rather than a ceremonial one, with the Downtown Yonge shopping and entertainment district containing landmarks such as the Eaton Centre and Yonge–Dundas Square.

==Route description==

Yonge Street originates on the northern shore of Toronto Bay at Queens Quay as a four-lane arterial road (speed limit 40 km/h) proceeding north. Toronto&#x27;s Harbourfront is built on landfill extended into the bay. The former industrial area has been converted from port, rail and industrial uses to a dense, residential, high-rise community. Indeed, Canada&#x27;s future tallest building, SkyTower at Pinnacle One Yonge, is located near the beginning of the street and has the address 1 Yonge Street. The elevated Gardiner Expressway and the congested rail lines of the Toronto railway viaduct on their approach to Union Station pass over Yonge Street. The road rises slightly near Front Street, marking the pre-landfill shoreline. Here, at the southern edge of the central business district, is the Dominion Public Building, the Meridian Hall and the Hockey Hall of Fame, the latter housed in a former Bank of Montreal office, once Canada&#x27;s largest bank branch. Beyond Front Street, the road passes through the east side of the Financial District, which holds many of Canada&#x27;s tallest buildings, and passes an entrance to the Allen Lambert Galleria.

Between Front and Queen Streets, Yonge Street is bounded by historic and commercial buildings, many serving the large weekday workforce concentrated here. These include the flagship Toronto locations of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and Saks Fifth Avenue, both in the historic Simpson&#x27;s building. Yonge Street&#x27;s entire west side, from Queen to Dundas Streets, is occupied by the Eaton Centre, a multi-storey indoor mall featuring shops along its Yonge Street frontage. The east side has two historic performance venues, the Ed Mirvish Theatre (formerly the Canon Theatre and before that, the Pantages) and the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres. In addition, Massey Hall is just to the east on Shuter Street.

Opposite the north end of the Eaton Centre lies Yonge–Dundas Square. The area now comprising the square was cleared of several small commercial buildings and redeveloped in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It has been outfitted with large video screens, and developed with retail shopping arcades, fountains and seating in a bid to become &quot;Toronto&#x27;s Times Square&quot;. It is the site of numerous public events.

Another stretch of busy retail lines both sides of Yonge Street north of Dundas Street. The density of businesses diminishes north of Gerrard Street; residential towers with some ground-floor commercial uses flank this section. The Art Deco College Park building, a former shopping complex of the T. Eaton Company, occupies much of the west side of the street from Gerrard Street north to College Street. It was converted into a residential and commercial complex after the building of the Eaton Centre.

From College Street north to Bloor Street, Yonge Street serves smaller street-level retail, mostly in two- to three-storey buildings of a hundred years&#x27; vintage. The businesses here, unlike the large chains that dominate south of Gerrard Street, are mostly small independent shops and serve a dense residential community on either side of Yonge Street.

The intersection of Yonge and Bloor streets is a major crossroads of Toronto, informally considered the northern edge of the downtown core. Subway Line 2 Bloor–Danforth intersects the Yonge line here, with the resulting transfers between lines making Bloor–Yonge station the busiest in the city. The northeast quadrant features the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Centre office and retail complex, including a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Hudson&#x27;s Bay store. The northwest quadrant has the Two Bloor West office tower. The southeast quadrant has a condominium tower constructed in the early 21st century, and the southwestern quadrant is being developed for a condominium. The Mink Mile&#x27;s borders extend from Yonge to Avenue Road along Bloor. The intersection of Yonge and Bloor streets is a &quot;scramble&quot;-type intersection, which allows pedestrians to cross from any corner to any other corner.

Immediately north of Bloor, the street is part of the old town of Yorkville, today a major shopping district extending west of Yonge Street along Cumberland and Bloor streets. North of Yorkville, densities and traffic decrease somewhat and the speed limit increases slightly (to 50 km/h, which it remains for most of its urban length) as Yonge Street forms the main street of Summerhill, which together with Rosedale to the east is noted for its opulent residences. The area is marked by the historic North Toronto railway station, formerly served by the Canadian Pacific Railway and now the location of a Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) store. The CPR route parallels the foot of the Iroquois shoreline escarpment, which Yonge Street ascends here toward Midtown. Development along Yonge to St. Clair Avenue is mostly two- and three-storey buildings with ground-floor commercial uses of varying types. South of St. Clair once stood the Deer Park carhouse for the Metropolitan Street Railway Metropolitan line. It was sold by the Toronto Transportation Commission to the Badminton and Racquet Club of Toronto in 1924 and mostly destroyed by a fire in 2017.

From approximately St. Clair Avenue to Yonge Boulevard, Yonge Street is central to the former suburb municipality of North Toronto, now widely referred to as Midtown, which is divided into several local neighbourhoods. Yonge Street along this stretch features mixed low-scale residential, retail, and commercial buildings. The intersection at Eglinton Avenue has become a focal point, serving as a high-density residential, commercial and transit hub. The site of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern is nearby, the location of a significant clash in the Upper Canada Rebellion and is marked as a National Historic Site. The tavern was later replaced by the Postal Station K Building, now a podium for Montgomery Square condominium complex.

North of Yonge Boulevard, Yonge Street traverses the deep forested ravine of the West Don Valley at Hoggs Hollow, a formidable obstacle in pioneer days and the site of one of the last of the former toll gates. The lower-density residential community and park-like setting here represent an interlude between North Toronto and the newer high-rise district beyond, towering over the valley. Canada&#x27;s busiest section of highway (Highway 401) spans the valley via the Hogg&#x27;s Hollow Bridge (exit 369). Leaving the valley north of Highway 401, densities and traffic both significantly increase on entering North York City Centre, the downtown core of the former suburban city of North York. North York Centre features numerous residential and office towers, most with ground-floor commercial uses, with some stretches of older two-storey buildings, many slated for redevelopment. Slightly under halfway up Yonge Street from Sheppard to Finch on the west side is the North York Civic Centre complex and the adjacent North York Centre office and retail towers. These lands contain Mel Lastman Square, the actual North York district municipal offices, the North York Central Library and the Toronto Centre for the Performing Arts. The street widens to a six-lane urban arterial road through North York Centre (although north of Sheppard Avenue the outer lanes are for parking outside of rush hours), passing inner-suburb transit hubs at Sheppard and Avenues.

From Finch Avenue to Stouffville Road (acquiring the York Regional Road 1 designation north of the Toronto city limits at Steeles Avenue in York Region), Yonge Street is a suburban commercial strip, passing Highway 407 (exit 77) two kilometres north of Steeles. This segment is a busy suburban arterial, interrupted by the original town centres of suburban communities such as Thornhill (where the route crosses the East Don Valley in the upper part of its watershed) and Richmond Hill. Various stretches of Yonge Street throughout this area contain residential high-rise buildings of varying ages, with some currently under development. Continuous urbanization ends just south of Stouffville Road, and the street passes through brief semi-rural exurban stretches between Richmond Hill, Aurora, Newmarket, and Holland Landing, passing a number of kettle lakes and traversing the crest of the Oak Ridges Moraine, thence leaving the Lake Ontario basin. Yonge passes through the core of Aurora, and in the regional seat of Newmarket, Yonge serves as the town&#x27;s main suburban artery, passing through low-density residential and commercial areas, bypassing its core to the west. North of Green Lane, Regional Road 1 deviates from the original baseline north of Lake Ontario, bypassing the centre of Holland Landing with a northwest heading and thereby circumnavigating Cook&#x27;s Bay and the lower Holland Marsh, through exurban areas en route to Bradford. The bypass was constructed in 1959.

=== York Regional Road 51 ===
Regional Road 51 is the original route of the main section. Yonge Street branches off Regional Road 1 at the foot of the bypass to continue north through Holland Landing. This short section, known locally as the &quot;Yonge Street Extension&quot;, is co-signed with Regional Road 13. At Queensville Side Road, the road breaks, and resumes again slightly to the west for before it ends in the upper Holland Marsh with an unopened road clearance signed with trees next to the Silver Lakes Golf and Country Club.

=== Simcoe Road 4 ===

Yonge resumes to the northwest in Bradford (reached via Regional Road 1), at a right turn at an intersection in downtown Bradford, where it is initially named Barrie Street before the name Yonge resumes, roughly paralleling Lake Simcoe&#x27;s western shore through rural countryside, traversing the rolling hills of southeast Simcoe County, and is signed Simcoe Road 4. The street officially ends in Barrie at a rail spur, where its name changes to Burton Avenue at Garden Drive, which itself ends less than a kilometre from Kempenfelt Bay, at a T-intersection with Essa Road.

==History==
===Establishment of the route===
With the outbreak of hostilities between France and Great Britain in 1793, part of the War of the First Coalition, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada (now Ontario), John Graves Simcoe, was concerned about the possibility of the United States entering British North America in support of their French allies. In particular, the location of Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake), the first and former capital of Upper Canada, was in danger of being attacked by the Americans from the nearby border. Additionally, U.S. forces could easily sever British access to the upper lakes at Lake St. Clair or the Detroit River, cutting the colony off from the important trading post at Michilimackinac.

Simcoe planned to move the capital to a better-protected location and build overland routes to the upper lakes as soon as possible. He established York, as Toronto was originally called, with its naturally enclosed harbour, as a defensible site for a new capital. To provide communications between the site and the upper lakes, he planned two connected roads, the first running north from York to Lake Simcoe, (then named &quot;Lake aux Claies&quot;), the second joining Lake Simcoe with Georgian Bay. This would allow overland transport to the upper lakes, bypassing U.S. strongholds. The route from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe is still known as Yonge Street, and the second leg to Georgian Bay was long known as the Penetanguishene Road.

Before the construction of Yonge Street, a portage route, the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, had already linked Lakes Ontario and Simcoe. On September 25, 1793, Simcoe and a small party of soldiers and native guides started northward along the trail, establishing the Pine Fort on the western branch of the Holland River, near the modern location of Bradford. Stopping only to rename Lake aux Claies &quot;Lake Simcoe&quot; in memory of his father, the party continued north to Lake Couchiching, and then down the Severn River to Georgian Bay. Here he selected the site of Penetanguishene as the location for a new naval base and port.

On his return, he met with an Ojibway named &#x27;Old Sail&#x27; and was shown a new route along another arm of the trail, this one starting on the eastern branch of the Holland River and thereby avoiding the marshes of the western branch (today&#x27;s Holland Marsh). They left Pine Fort on October 11 and reached York on the 15th. Simcoe selected this eastern route for his new road, moving the southern end from the Rouge River to the western outskirts of the settled area in York, and the northern end to a proposed new town on the Holland River, St. Albans.

The road was actually called Concession 1 at first with Concessions 2 etc. on either side. For instance Concession 1 Whitchurch Township faces Yonge St. and goes east to Concession 2, which starts at Bayview Ave. Concession 1 King Township faces Yonge St. and goes west to Concession 2, which starts at Bathurst St. There are 10 concessions in York County going east and west from Concession 1, Yonge Street. The east side ending at then-Ontario County, now Durham Region, and the west side ending at Peel County (now Peel Region).

===Construction of Yonge Street===

The following spring, Simcoe instructed Deputy Surveyor General Augustus Jones to blaze a small trail marking the route. Simcoe initiated construction of the road by granting land to settlers, who in exchange were required to clear 33 feet of frontage on the road passing their lot. Certain seasons saw the muddy sidewalks of York in deplorable condition, and Yonge Street was renowned as being particularly bad, making it difficult to transport loads along it. The first Toronto resident known to have introduced sidewalks was Jesse Ketchum, who used tanned bark.

In the summer of 1794, William Berczy was the first to take up the offer, leading a group of 64 families northeast of Toronto to found the town of German Mills, in modern Markham. By the end of 1794, Berczy&#x27;s settlers had cleared the route around Thornhill. However, the settlement was hit by a series of setbacks and road construction stalled.

Work on the road started again in 1795 when the Queen&#x27;s Rangers took over. They began their work at Eglinton Avenue and proceeded north, reaching the site of St. Albans on 16 February 1796. Expansion of the trail into a road was a condition of settlement for farmers along the route, who were required to spend 12 days a year to clear the road of logs, subsequently removed by convicted drunks as part of their sentences. The southern end of the road was in use in the first decade of the 19th century, and became passable all the way to the northern end in 1816.

The road was extended south from Eglinton to Bloor Street in 1796 by Berczy, who needed a route to his warehouse on the Toronto lakeshore. The area south of Bloor Street proved too swampy for a major road. A path did exist between Queen and Bloor Streets, but was called the &quot;road to Yonge Street&quot;, rather than being considered part of the street itself due to its poor condition. Over time the creeks were rerouted and the swamps drained. In 1812 the route was extended from Queen Street to the harbour, and in 1828 the entire southern portion was solidified with gravel.

St. Albans never developed as Simcoe had hoped, but the town of Holland Landing eventually grew up on the site, a somewhat more descriptive name. Holland Landing was settled by Quakers who moved into the area after having left the United States in the aftermath of the American Revolution. The settlers were branching out from their initial town of &quot;Upper Yonge Street&quot;, which later became Newmarket.

The road almost served its original military purpose during the War of 1812, when construction of a new fleet of first-rate ships began on the Lakes, necessitating the shipment of a large anchor from England for use on a frigate under construction on Lake Huron. The war ended while the anchor was still being moved, and now lies just outside Holland Landing in a park named in its honour.

===Evolution of Yonge Street===
Bears were known to wander onto Yonge Street in the early days of Toronto. In 1809 Lieutenant Fawcett, of the 100th Regiment, came across a large bear on the street and cut its head open with his sword.

In 1824, work began to extend Yonge Street to Kempenfelt Bay near Barrie. A northwestern extension was branched off the original Yonge Street in Holland Landing (present-day Holland Landing Road and the stretch of York Road 1 running northwest of Bathurst Street) and ran into the new settlement of Bradford before turning north towards Barrie (with the Bradford-Barrie stretch being the only part of the later Highway 11 apart from the original section ever to be named Yonge). Work was completed by 1827, making connections with the Penetanguishene Road. In 1833, the legislature voted to &quot;macadamise&quot; some portions of the dirt road.
The decision was made to withdraw the military garrison in Penetanguishene in 1852. A year later, the Northern Railway of Canada was built along this established route, between Toronto and Kempenfelt Bay and extended to Collingwood by 1855. Settlement along the Penetanguishene Road pre-dated the road itself. Subsequent extensions of Yonge Street (though never named as such) which later became the more northerly parts of Highway 11, built in the 1830s (some with military strategy in mind), pushed settlement northeast along the shores of Lake Simcoe. By 1860 the Muskoka Road penetrated the southern skirts of the Canadian Shield, advancing towards Lake Nipissing.

The government of Upper Canada had a limited tax base and a vast area to settle, so they asked private individuals to build and maintain roads in exchange for the right to toll wayfarers. This was a commonplace arrangement at the time: For example, a 13-km stretch of Davenport Road between the Humber River and the Don River had no less than five tollbooths spaced along its length. In the 1830s, the tollbooth near York Mills&#x27; Miller Tavern and north of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern was &quot;a tiny two-storey building on the west side of Yonge&quot; at the top of the hill &quot;with a roof stretched over the roadway to a support on the far side.&quot;

In 1850, Yonge Street together with a number of other local roads was purchased at auction by James Beatty and his Toronto Road Company for £75,100. Beatty was out of pocket in September 1863, and the legislature once more assumed control until April 1865, when it was able to pass control (also at auction) to York County Council for $72,500.

The tolls in effect in 1875 ranged from 1 cent for each pig, sheep, or goat to 10 cents for every vehicle with a load drawn by a horse. The tolls were designed to tax those that had money: Farmers on their way to market.
A horse-drawn streetcar line was completed on Yonge Street in Toronto in September 1861 and operated by the Toronto Street Railway. The line went from Scollard Street to King Street. Streetcar service would be electrified in Toronto by 1892.

Confederation and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway further diminished the importance of Yonge Street, as the new Dominion of Canada heralded the construction of east–west trade routes spanning the continent. By the 1870s, Henry Scadding, author of &quot;Toronto of Old&quot;, declared that Penetanguishene did not have the importance to need an approach such as the &quot;extension of the Yonge Street Road.&quot;

During the late 1800s, the Toronto and York Radial Railway used the Yonge Street right-of-way, originally to the town of North Toronto, but expanding over the years all the way to Sutton, on southern Lake Simcoe. The Radial Railway ran along the eastern side of the street, allowing the prevailing westerly winds to remove snow from the slightly raised rails. The arrival of the Canadian Northern Railway in 1906 lessened traffic on the Radial, but it was not until Yonge became a major route for cars that the Radial truly fell into disuse. The last TYRR train north from Toronto ran on March 16, 1930. The line was then purchased by the townships north of the city and re-incorporated as North Yonge Railways, running service for another eighteen years before operations ended, along with service on numerous other portions of the Radial lines, in 1948. The space it formerly occupied was used to expand the road between Aurora and Newmarket.

===Yonge Street Corridor===
The Yonge Street corridor has evolved significantly over the past century, and is currently seeing a new wave of mixed-use high rise developments. The everlasting construction of office buildings, high-rise residential towers, along with a variety of shops populating the major corridor across the towns and cities it traverses. This unique and extensive built-form encourages residents from the East and Western sections of the region to unite in the heart of the GTA.

Stretching through the center of the Greater Toronto Area, Yonge Street has transformed into a vital route, accommodating not only vehicular traffic but also serving as a central hub for transportation and commerce. The corridor is home to the Yonge-University Subway Line, serving Toronto,Vaughan, and soon Richmond Hill as the government of Ontario prepares for the construction of the Yonge North Subway Extension. In addition, the Yonge Street Rapidway located North of Toronto, is a comprehensive BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) in York Region allowing for convenient access to Finch Subway Station, in Toronto. Moreover, Yonge Street hosts numerous modes of public transportation, which connects people to major infrastructure spanning over 30 kilometres.

=== Canada&#x27;s first Subway ===

From the early 1900s onwards, there were several proposals to build a subway for streetcars on Yonge Street, given the high demand for north–south travel within downtown Toronto. Following World War 2, the Toronto Transit Commission proposed a north–south subway line along the Yonge Street corridor between Union Station and Eglinton Avenue. Approved by voters in 1946, construction began in September 1949, with disruptive cut-and-cover construction on Yonge Street taking place between College Avenue and Front Street. The Yonge Subway was opened in 1954 as Canada&#x27;s first subway line at a cost of $59m. The line has subsequently been extended several times, most recently to Vaughan, York Region in 2017. The line – now Line 1 Yonge–University – is the busiest subway line in Canada, and one of the busiest in North America.

=== Yonge Street as the &quot;longest street in the world&quot; ===

Yonge Street was formerly a part of Highway 11, which led to claims that Yonge Street was the longest street in the world. Running (mostly) concurrent with Yonge as far north as Barrie, then continuing beyond through central and northern Ontario to the Ontario–Minnesota border at Rainy River, the highway was over long. But Yonge Street could only be called the longest street in the world if it were fully synonymous with Highway 11 over the highway&#x27;s entire length, which has never been the case.

The original historic alignment of Yonge Street diverges from the former Highway 11 (now York Regional 1) in East Gwillimbury, one kilometre north of Green Lane; at this junction, York Road 1 diverts northwest, while Yonge Street turns right at the intersection and then loops back to continue the straight alignment. It then continues, ending at Queensville Side Road in Holland Landing. Approximately 350 metres further west at a jog, it runs north for about 1.8 kilometres, stopping at a dead end just past the Silver Lakes Golf and Country Club; further north, the name picks up again as an unpaved farm road which ends at Ravenshoe Road west of Keswick and just south of Lake Simcoe. The diversion running from Holland Landing to Bradford does not carry the Yonge name but instead was named Bradford Street in Holland Landing, and Holland Landing Road in Bradford. The latter was later extended as a bypass was added, curving off the original alignment. A second bypass was later constructed, bypassing the entirety of Holland Landing Road and joining Bradford at Bridge Street. At its intersection with 8th Line in Bradford, the former Highway 11 route does pick up the name Yonge again (the only stretch of the former highway aside from the original Yonge Street to carry it), retaining it through Innisfil until transitioning into Burton Avenue in the Allandale neighbourhood of Barrie, which ends shortly after at Essa Road.

From that point, no other part of the highway any further north ever carried the Yonge Street name, and it makes several turns in Barrie itself as it follows various streets. At its terminus in Rainy River, Highway 11&#x27;s street name is Atwood Avenue rather than Yonge Street. When the final leg of Highway 11 between Atikokan and Rainy River was completed in 1965, the Rainy River Chamber of Commerce responded with a publicity stunt requesting that Toronto change the name of Yonge Street to Atwood Avenue so that the highway could have the same street name at both ends, but this did not occur.
The claim was first added by the Guinness Book of Records in 1977 at the request of Toronto writer Jay Myers, supplanting Figueroa Street in Los Angeles. Myers had sought the designation after writing and publishing a book about the history of the street. Earlier claims that Yonge was the longest street in the world also existed, with &quot;The Globe&quot; asserting it about the original Toronto to Lake Simcoe alignment in 1895, at a time when the rest of Highway 11 did not even exist yet, and later claiming in 1953 that Yonge was the longest street in the world because it purportedly extended to Cochrane, which was then and still is the point at which Highway 11 switches from a north–south alignment to an east–west alignment toward Nipigon. It continued to be listed by Guinness until 1999, when it was dropped in favour of recognizing the Pan-American Highway as the world&#x27;s longest motorable road.

Provincial downloading separated Yonge Street from Highway 11 in the late 1990s. As a result, Highway 11 does not start until Crown Hill just outside Barrie, several kilometres north of where the name Yonge Street ends.

Although current tourist campaigns do not make much of Yonge Street&#x27;s length, its status as an urban myth was bolstered by an art installation at the foot of Yonge Street and a map of its purported length laid out into the sidewalk in bronze at the southwest corner of Yonge and Dundas Streets. However, possibly due to wider recognition of the street&#x27;s actual length, the map inlay has now been removed.

Interestingly, the true longest &quot;named street&quot; in the world may be another street originating in Toronto; Dundas Street. It runs west from the city (crossing Yonge) to London, Ontario; with that name throughout most of its length, including at both ends. It was conceived and constructed as a single street, although it has several bypasses and discontinuous sections today.

===2000s===
In 2008, Toronto&#x27;s first pedestrian scramble was opened at the intersection of Yonge and Dundas Streets.

On April 23, 2018, a driver intentionally struck numerous pedestrians, killing 11 and injuring 15 others. The attack started at the intersection of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue and proceeded south along the sidewalks of Yonge Street to near Sheppard Avenue.

==Cultural significance==
As Toronto&#x27;s main street, Yonge hosts parades, street performances, and protests. After major sporting victories thousands of people will gather on its downtown portions, particularly near Dundas Square, to celebrate, and the street will be closed to vehicular traffic. Streetcars on routes crossing Yonge in that area (Carlton, Dundas, Queen, King) during those celebrations will often have to cease operations a few hundred metres east or west of Yonge Street due to the crowds. In recent times, these celebrations particularly occurred after the Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series of Baseball in 1992 and 1993, when the Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team won the Olympic gold medal in 2002, 2010 and 2014, and when the Toronto Raptors won the NBA championship in 2019. During these celebrations motorists drive up and down the other portions of the street honking their horns and flying flags and during lesser celebrations (when the crowds have not closed down the street), they will do this along the downtown portions of the street as well.

Sections of the street are often closed for other events, such as an annual street festival. In 1999 Ricky Martin held an autograph session at Sunrise Records and had a large section of the street closed for the day. The intersection of Yonge and Dundas Streets, centred on the plaza at Yonge-Dundas Square, has been closed on occasion to host free concerts, including performances by R.E.M. on 17 May 2001, by Beyoncé on 15 September 2006 and by John Mayer on 16 September of the same year.

Five-pin bowling was invented and first played at the Toronto Bowling Club at Yonge and Temperance Streets.

Ken Westerfield and Jim Kenner are credited with introducing ultimate and other disc sports (frisbee) to Canada. They did nightly Frisbee shows on the Yonge Street Mall between Gerrard and Dundas in 1971–1974.

Toronto&#x27;s annual LGBTQ Pride, Orange Order, and Santa Claus parades also use Yonge Street for a significant portion of their routes.

===Cultural references===
The early works of Canadian singer-songwriters such as Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot were featured at the Yonge Street location of Sam the Record Man, just north of Dundas Street, at a time when records by Canadian musicians were not widely available. Lightfoot has a song about Yonge Street, titled &quot;On Yonge Street,&quot; on his album &quot;A Painter Passing Through&quot;.

Yonge Street was also the subject or setting for an SCTV comedy sketch featuring John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Andrea Martin, and Jayne Eastwood. The sketch, &quot;Garth &amp; Gord &amp; Fiona &amp; Alice,&quot; was a parody of the Canadian film &quot;Goin&#x27; Down the Road,&quot; about young men from the provinces discovering the bright lights of Yonge Street.

The Canadian singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn makes this reference in his song &quot;Coldest Night of the Year,&quot; in his 1981 album &quot;Mummy Dust&quot;: &quot;I took in Yonge Street at a glance / Heard the punkers playing / Watched the bikers dance / Everybody wishing they could go to the south of France / And you&#x27;re not here / On the coldest night of the year.&quot;

Singer and rapper K-os also references the street in the lyrics of his 2004 single &quot;Crabbuckit&quot;: &quot;Walking down Yonge Street on a Friday / Can&#x27;t follow them, gotta do it my way / No fast lane, still on a highway&quot;.

==Public transit==
In Toronto, Yonge Street is served by the eastern half of the Line 1 Yonge–University subway, which runs north from Union Station at Front Street to Finch Avenue. The first section of the &quot;Yonge subway&quot; opened in 1954 as Canada&#x27;s first subway line, and is now the busiest rapid transit route in Canada, and one of the busiest in North America. There is also a supplementary bus route running along the street, as well as an overnight Blue Night bus route which operates after the subway closes.

In York Region, the street is served by Viva Blue, a bus rapid transit route which connects with Finch station at the northern terminus of the subway, using the Yonge Street Rapidway, a dedicated median bus right-of-way (with separate sections), serving stops named &quot;Vivastations&quot;, from Highway 7 in Richmond Hill to Newmarket. The subway is proposed to be extended north to Highway 7. Viva Blue is also supplemented by two local-service routes. In Holland Landing, there are transit services as well. In Simcoe County, GO Transit runs a bus route along Yonge from Newmarket to Barrie. Barrie Transit operates Route 8 (8A RVH/Yonge and 8B Crosstown/Essa), a circular route with directional branches that serve Yonge for a portion of their respective routes.

=== Yonge North Subway Extension (YNSE) ===
The Yonge North Subway Extension (YNSE) is a significant transit project aimed at connecting the TTC&#x27;s Line 1 subway service to New Downtown Richmond Hill by approximately 8 kilometers from Finch Station into York Region. This expansion project will cover areas within the cities of Markham, Vaughan, and Richmond Hill.

Upon completion, the YNSE will integrate with local and GO transit services, assuring the strong transit connectivity in the region. The project commenced on October 6, 2022, with construction activities initiated by Metrolinx in Spring 2023. Although no specific completion date has been announced, it&#x27;s anticipated that approximately 6.3 kilometres of tunnelling will be required for the full 8-kilometre extension. The Yonge North Subway Extension represents a long-anticipated development, first included in York Region&#x27;s plans since 1994 and subsequently integrated into the Province&#x27;s transportation agenda in 2007.

The trunk routes serving the street are:

Toronto (TTC):

York Region (YRT):

Simcoe County (GO Transit):

Barrie (Barrie Transit):

<text>Travel blending is a technique, developed in Australia, for encouraging people to make more efficient and environmentally sound transportation choices. The technique involves governments encouraging citizens to undertake a greater number of tasks on one trip, rather than making several trips to multiple locations at different times, thus improving travel efficiency and decreasing the strain on transportation networks.

The technique originated in Sydney, as an effort to reduce air pollution before the 2000 Summer Olympics.

<text>The Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (; FE de las JONS) was a fascist political party founded in Spain in 1934 as merger of the Falange Española and the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista. FE de las JONS, which became the main fascist group during the Second Spanish Republic, ceased to exist as such when, during the Civil War, General Francisco Franco merged it with the Traditionalist Communion in April 1937 to form the similarly named Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS (FET y de las JONS).

== History ==
=== Early history ===
In 1934, Falange Española (FE) merged with the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (JONS) of Onésimo Redondo and Ramiro Ledesma, becoming the &#x27;Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista&#x27;. During and after the 1933 election campaign, members of both the Falange and JONS had been killed; on 9 February 1934, Matías Montero was murdered while selling Falangist newspapers, becoming a martyr for the small movement. By June 1934, ten of them were dead, killed primarily by the Socialists but also with an anarchist contribution; the Socialists had no intention of allowing a fascist movement to develop in Spain, fearing such a movement would crush them as had happened in Germany and Italy. The Falangists initially fought back ineffectively (resulting in their being ridiculed by the rest of the political right) but eventually they formed their own death squads. After the tenth fascist, Juan Cuéllar, was killed and had his corpse abused in Madrid on 10 June 1934 during a confrontation with socialists, the Falangists attacked a group of Socialist Youth, killing a young woman, Juanita Rico, who was alleged to have abused the corpse, and seriously wounding two other socialists. Rico received a large funeral and was hailed as &quot;the first victim of fascism in Spain.&quot; Rico&#x27;s killers seemed to have acted on their own initiative without informing their superiors and an escalation of violence soon followed; José Antonio had to put his foot down to prevent some Falangists from assassinating Indalecio Prieto and from blowing up the Socialists&#x27; headquarters in Madrid.

The party was initially organised as a triumvirate formed by Ramiro Ledesma, Ruiz de Alda and José Antonio Primo de Rivera, while the secondary General Secretary position was given to Raimundo Fernández-Cuesta. It attracted a considerable number of prominent intellectuals, including Pedro Mourlane Michelena, Rafael Sánchez Mazas, Ernesto Giménez Caballero, Eugenio Montes, José María Alfaro, Agustín de Foxa, Luys Santa Marina, Samuel Ros, Jacinto Miquelarena and Dionisio Ridruejo.

 has recognised at least four different ideological strands within the Falange, a somewhat ecumenical party, from the fusion until the expulsion of Ledesma: conservatism espoused by monarchists such as Francisco Moreno Herrera, marquis of Eliseda; the authoritarian Catholicism of Onésimo Redondo; the radical (and anti-clerical) national syndicalism of Ramiro Ledesma; and the distinctive elitist regenerationism of José Antonio Primo de Rivera.

In October 1934, the direction unified under a &quot;Jefe Nacional&quot; (National Chief) in the person of José Antonio and developed the political program known as &quot;the 27 Points&quot;.

In November 1934, the marquis of Eliseda, a financial backer of the party, left the Falange over disagreements with party proposals in regards to state-church relations, which he deemed &quot;frankly heretical&quot;. His departure left the party without its main income and propaganda apparatus.

Inner tensions over the draft of the political program continued. The power struggle between Ramiro Ledesma, who espoused a radical and anti-capitalist vision; and José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who held a more conservative and aristocratic one, eventually led to the expulsion of Ledesma in January 1935. The party also had difficulties in achieving in economic solvency. Although, in principle, it received support from large financiers and landowners, this was not enough until in 1935, it was subsidized monthly with 50,000 lire by the Italian Fascist regime. The subsidy was reduced by half and withdrawn after the poor electoral results of 1936.

The party was republican, modernist, championed the lower classes and opposed both oligarchy and communism, but it never garnered the kind of popular following demonstrated by fascist movements elsewhere in Europe. For these reasons, the Falange was shunned by other right-leaning parties in the Spanish general election of 1936. Its candidates ran in 19 electoral districts (out of 60). There were some 83,000 people voting for Falangist candidates, but given 1 voter was entitled to a number of votes, the party obtained 0.11% of all votes cast. The only district where FE exceeded 1% of votes was Valladolid (1.63%); in three other districts (Caceres, Cadiz and La Coruna) it gained more than 0.5% of votes. Primo de Rivera (who was running in 13 districts) obtained a total of 24,017 votes; Manuel López Sendón received 18,704 votes and Raimundo Fernández-Cuesta got 10,438 votes.

Having likely never exceeded ten thousand members in the early 1930s, the Falange lost supporters in the run-up to the Spanish Civil War, leaving a core of young, dedicated activists, many in the organization&#x27;s student organization, the Sindicato Español Universitario. The Falangist program was heavily influenced by Catholicism but the party desired a separation between church and state; the Falange had no intention of forcing Catholicism upon millions of Spanish non-believers. The Falangist were in some ways anti-conservative, as while most of the Spanish conservative right refused any reform and defended private property at all levels, the Falange favoured some nationalisations (such as banking and public services), as well as economic and social reform; the Falange defended &quot;legitimate&quot; productive capitalism while denouncing what they regarded usurious, financial and speculative capitalism. This view was compatible with private property but not with the abuses perpetrate against the lower classes, whom the Falange believed should be saved from the misery in which they lived (referring specifically to landless peasants and day labourers). The party thus did not desire a left-wing revolution but poverty alleviation and to end class struggle by using a new, vertical, syndicalist structure under the Falange. The party desired to attract people from all social classes, whether or not they had been members of left-wing organisations; the Falange viewed conflict between political parties as a consequence of liberalism and democracy. They hoped this unification would make Spain powerful again and allow Spain to launch further imperial acquisitions. However, historian Stanley Payne argues that the Falange had no desire to actually conquer territory (with de Rivera viewing the age of conquest as at an end) but instead their idea of an empire actually meant increasing Spanish cultural power, particularly in Latin America where Spain could act as a kind of Hispanic cultural leader. There was also the prospect of forming a type of federation with Portugal.

The party had a militia, the (&quot;first line&quot;), and it had a detailed training manual, probably prepared by the retired Lieutenant Colonel Luis Arrendondo, which carried instructions for guerilla warfare. While the Falange was not prepared for such a serious activity at the time, the document was well-publicised and convinced the Spanish Left that fascism was a serious threat in Spain. The Falange also had its own intelligence service, the (&quot;Information service of the movement&quot;).
The group had access to a variety of weapons, firearms and explosives. A few months before the war began, several artillery officers began providing military training to Falangist militants.

The Falange&#x27;s male membership was accompanied by a female auxiliary, the (&quot;female section&quot;). Led by the José Antonio&#x27;s sister Pilar, this latter subsidiary organization claimed more than a half million members by the end of the civil war and provided nursing and support services for the Nationalist forces. During the spring of 1936, when police persecution of the Falange (including the Women&#x27;s Section) was at its height, the organisation was described by Rivera as the only Falangist section that was still largely intact and it proved crucial in the reorganisation of the Falange into a true underground movement. The Women&#x27;s Section raised money for Falangist prisoners and their families and distributed clandestine propaganda, as well as carrying messages from imprisoned leaders to outside militants.

Following the 1936 elections, more violence erupted between the Falange and its enemies. While Rivera initially thought that the new government might implement the &quot;national revolution&quot; and ordered his militants to abstain from hostile acts against the government, it was not to last. On 6 March, four members of the Falangist trade union, CONS, who failed to support a leftist strike were killed. On 11 March, two law students, one Falangist and the other Carlist, were shot to death, allegedly by the Socialist Youth of Spain. Since there had been six Falange-affiliated deaths in five days, the Falange retaliated and on 13 March, several fascist gunman attempted to kill Luis Jiménez de Asúa, a well-known Socialist leader and law professor who was also one of the authors of the Republican Constitution. While he survived, a member of his police escort was fatally wounded. On 16 April, Falangists opened fire with submachineguns against workers in the centre of Madrid, killing three and wounding forty. During the Popular Front government, sixty-seven Falangists were killed, compared to forty-one during the previous two years. In turn, the Falange killed sixty-four leftists, mostly socialists and communists. To survive against increased government persecution, the movement adopted a communist-style cell structure of three members per cell. One of the reasons the organisation survived was due to a large influx of new members, with 15,000 members of the CEDA youth organisation, JAP, joining the Falange (though this was a small number compared to JAP&#x27;s total membership of 225,000).

The left-wing Popular Front government persecuted the Falange and imprisoned the Marqués de Estella on 6 July 1936. In turn, the Falange joined the conspiracy to overthrow the Second Spanish Republic, supporting the military revolt ultimately led by Francisco Franco and continuing to do so throughout the ensuing Spanish Civil War.

=== Spanish Civil War ===
With the eruption of the Civil War in July 1936, the Falange fought on the side of the Nationalist faction against the Second Spanish Republic, expanding rapidly from several thousand to several hundred thousand. Many people joined the Falange out of fear of persecution – former leftists and centrists rushed to join and tried to avert suspicion of their loyalties by being more fascist than the actual fascists. The massive influx of opportunists swamped the &quot;old shirts&quot; – nearly half of the pre-war veterans had died during the initial stages of the rebellion and several of its key leaders were either dead or captured, thus the swollen membership proved extremely awkward for the organisation.
Other Nationalist later mocked the influx of former leftists in &quot;&quot; (a portmanteau with , the Iberian Anarchist Federation).

The Falange, through its leader and co-founder, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, collaborated in the different conspiracies and military attempts to overthrow the Republic. In the last months, with the conspiracy that would lead to the uprising that was already underway, and with the Falange virtually excluded, Primo de Rivera was actively trying to get it to play a more decisive role. In contact with the conspirators from the prison of Alicante, where he was imprisoned, he alternated communiqués begging for a prompt uprising, with conditions to join the conspiracy that the military did not meet. Finally, an announcement on 17 July called on his organizations to join the coup, accepting an auxiliary role. The command of the party rested upon Manuel Hedilla, a former mechanic, as many of the first generation leaders were dead or incarcerated by the Republicans. Among them was Primo de Rivera, who was a government prisoner. As a result, he was referred to among the leadership as , (&quot;the Absent One&quot;). After being sentenced to death on 18 November 1936, José Antonio Primo de Rivera was executed on 20 November 1936 (a date since known as 20-N in Spain) in a Republican prison, giving him martyr status among the Falangists. This conviction and sentence was possible because he had lost his parliamentary immunity after his party did not have enough votes during the last elections. Hedilla played an important role in seizing the town of Corunna, bringing in well-armed Falangists to help rebels secure the town and partaking in some of the worst repression of the war there. Yet he later became one of the most outspoken critics of nationalist killings, arguing it alienated the workers from their cause – on Christmas Eve 1936 he told the Falange not to persecute workers who had &quot;voted for the left out of hunger or despair. We all know that in many towns there were – and are – right-wingers who are worse than the reds.&quot; These statements, however, made Hedilla and other left-wing Falangists highly suspect in the eyes of the Spanish right. Tension arose between the left and right wings of the Falange and the German ambassador encouraged Hedilla to resist the middle-class take over of the organisation. On the night of 16 April 1937, Hedilla&#x27;s followers (though not Hedilla himself) attempted to seize the Falangist&#x27;s headquarters in Salamanca from the rightists led by Sancho Dávila, resulting in a gun battle around the Plaza Mayor that left two Falangists dead and order had to be restored by the Civil Guard. On 18 April, Hedilla arranged a meeting at the Falange council in which he was elected leader.

After Francisco Franco seized power on 19 April 1937, he united under his command the Falange with the Carlist &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista&quot; with the Unification Decree, forming the &quot;Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS&quot; (&quot;FET y de las JONS&quot;), whose official ideology was the Falangists&#x27; —reduced after the unification to 26. While the Carlists came off worse in this forced union, Franco had correctly deduced that they would be more obedient and less politically minded, making it less of a concern. Despite this, the party was in fact a wide-ranging nationalist coalition, closely controlled by Franco. Parts of the original Falange (including Hedilla) and many Carlists did not join the unified party. Franco had sought to control the Falange after a clash between Hedilla and his main critics within the group, the of Agustín Aznar and Sancho Dávila y Fernández de Celis, that threatened to derail the Nationalist war effort. The new uniform consisted of the Carlist red beret and the Falangist blue shirt. While the Falange was increasingly integrated into the Nationalist military, it did manage to maintain its own identity; their uniforms and correspondence maintained their own Falangist insignia, while the traditional term was used to refer to fallen comrades in reports and logs.

None of the vanquished parties in the war suffered such a toll of deaths among their leaders as did the Falange. 60% of the pre-war Falangist membership lost their lives in the war.

However, most of the property of all other parties and trade unions were assigned to the party. In 1938, all trade unions were unified under Falangist command.

<doc id="285337" wikidata="Q233997" url="?curid=285337" title="Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge">
<text>Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge (Mary Adelaide Wilhelmina Elizabeth; 27 November 1833 – 27 October 1897), later known as the Duchess of Teck, was a member of the British royal family. She was one of the first royals to patronise a wide range of charities and was a first cousin of Queen Victoria.

Mary Adelaide was the daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel. Her father was the seventh son of King George III and Queen Charlotte. Mary Adelaide married Francis, Duke of Teck, with whom she had four children. The Duke and Duchess of Teck&#x27;s daughter, Victoria Mary, commonly known as &quot;May&quot;, was the wife of George V and became known as Queen Mary. Through her daughter, Mary Adelaide was the grandmother of the British kings Edward VIII and George VI.

==Early life==

Mary Adelaide was born on 27 November 1833 in the Kingdom of Hanover, German Confederation. Her father was Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the youngest surviving son of George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her mother was Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, the daughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel. As a male-line granddaughter of a British monarch, she was styled as a British princess with the prefix of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

The young Princess was baptised on 9 January 1834 at Cambridge House, Hanover, by Revd John Ryle Wood, Chaplain to the Duke of Cambridge. Her godmother and paternal aunt Princess Elizabeth, Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg, was the only godparent who was present. The others were William IV and Queen Adelaide (her paternal uncle and aunt), Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh (her paternal aunt), Princess Marie of Hesse-Kassel (her maternal aunt) and Princess Marie Luise Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel (her maternal first cousin). She was named Mary Adelaide Wilhelmina Elizabeth for her aunts and uncle.

Mary Adelaide spent the early years of her life in Hanover, where her father acted as viceroy, in place of her uncles George IV and later William IV.

After the death of William IV in 1837, Mary Adelaide&#x27;s first cousin, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, ascended the throne. However, under Salic law, only patrilineal succession was allowed and this prevented Victoria from also ascending the throne of Hanover, which instead passed to Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. Thus, the personal union between Britain and Hanover, which had existed for over a century, came to an end along with the arrangement of Hanover&#x27;s ruler living in England as the British monarch and using a viceroy to represent him in Hanover. The Duke of Cumberland moved to Hanover as king and Mary Adelaide&#x27;s father, no longer needed in Hanover, returned to London with his family, setting up residence in Kensington Palace.

==Marriage==
By the age of 30, Mary Adelaide was still unmarried. At one point, King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy was thought of as possible husband for Mary Adelaide. He had a scandalous reputation and was a notorious womaniser; it was said that whenever he visited a country he went to the theatre and music halls and sent notes propositioning the chorus girls. His behaviour in England did little to enhance his reputation. Mary Adelaide&#x27;s above-average weight (earning her the disparaging epithet of &quot;Fat Mary&quot;) and lack of income were also considered to deter potential suitors, as was her advancing age.

Eventually, a suitable candidate was found by the Prince of Wales and his wife Princess Alexandra on a visit to the Austrian court at Vienna in 1865. During the visit, they met and took a liking to a young officer in the Austrian Army, Prince Francis of Teck, a minor member of the royal family of Württemberg. Francis was of lower rank than Mary Adelaide, was the product of a morganatic marriage and had no succession rights to the throne of Württemberg, but was at least of princely title and of royal blood. He was also considered to be &quot;the most handsome man at the Austrian court&quot;, where he was known as , &quot;the handsome cavalry officer&quot;. The Prince of Wales invited the young officer to visit the royal court in Britain, and upon Francis&#x27;s arrival on 6 March 1866 arranged for him to meet Mary Adelaide. &quot;The wooing was but a short affair&quot;, according to Mary Adelaide: the pair were introduced on 7 March 1866, and a month later were engaged, much to the satisfaction of Mary Adelaide&#x27;s family. &quot;Everyone seemed to think it would &quot;do&quot;&quot;, Mary Adelaide&#x27;s daughter May would later say, &quot;and it did&quot;. The couple were married on 12 June 1866 at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew, Surrey.

The Duke and Duchess of Teck chose to reside in London rather than abroad, mainly because Mary Adelaide received £5,000 per annum as a parliamentary annuity and carried out royal duties. Her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, also provided her with supplementary income. Requests to Queen Victoria for extra funds were generally refused; however, the Queen did provide the Tecks with apartments at Kensington Palace and White Lodge in Richmond Park as a country house.

Mary Adelaide requested that her new husband be granted the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, but this was refused by Queen Victoria. The Queen did, however, promote Francis to the rank of &quot;Highness&quot; in 1887 in celebration of her Golden Jubilee.

===Children===
The Tecks had one daughter and three sons:
==Life abroad==
Despite the couple&#x27;s modest income, Mary Adelaide had expensive tastes and lived an extravagant life of parties, expensive food and clothes and holidays abroad. In 1883 they were forced to live more cheaply abroad in order to reduce their debts. With their children, they travelled to Florence, Italy, and also stayed with relatives in Germany and Austria. Initially, they travelled under the names of the Count and Countess von Hohenstein. However, Mary Adelaide wished to travel in more style and reverted to her actual title, which commanded significantly more attention and better service.

==Later life and death==
The Tecks returned from their self-imposed exile in 1885 and continued to live at Kensington Palace and White Lodge in Richmond Park. Mary Adelaide began devoting her life to charity, serving as patron to Barnardo&#x27;s and other children&#x27;s charities.

In 1891, Mary Adelaide was keen for her daughter, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (known as &quot;May&quot;), to marry one of the sons of the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII. At the same time, Queen Victoria wanted a British-born bride for the future king, though of course one of royal rank and ancestry, and Mary Adelaide&#x27;s daughter fulfilled the rank criteria. After Queen Victoria&#x27;s approval, May became engaged to Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, second in line to the British throne. He died suddenly six weeks later. Queen Victoria was fond of Princess Mary and persuaded the Duke of Clarence&#x27;s brother and next in the line of succession, Prince George, Duke of York, to marry her instead. They married in the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace, on 6 July 1893.

Mary Adelaide never lived to see her daughter become Princess of Wales or Queen, as she died on 27 October 1897 at White Lodge, following an emergency operation. She was buried on 3 November 1897 in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

Mary Adelaide Close in Kingston Vale, on the edge of Richmond Park, is named after her.

<doc id="285343" wikidata="Q1161179" url="?curid=285343" title="MacLife">
<text>MacLife (stylized as Mac|Life) is an American monthly magazine published by Future US. It focuses on products produced by Apple, including the Macintosh personal computer, iPad, and iPhone. It was sold as a print product on newsstands, but is now a digital-only product distributed through Magazines Direct and the Mac|Life app, the latter of which can be obtained via the App Store. From September 1996 until February 2007, the magazine was known as MacAddict.

==History==
&quot;MacLife&quot; is one of two successor magazines to the defunct &quot;CD-ROM Today&quot;. First published in 1993 by Imagine Publishing (now Future US), &quot;CD-ROM Today&quot; was targeted at both Windows and Macintosh users, and each issue shipped with a CD-ROM of shareware and demo programs. In August 1996, &quot;CD-ROM Today&quot; ceased publication, with two magazines taking its place: &quot;MacAddict&quot; for Macintosh users, and &quot;boot&quot; (now &quot;Maximum PC&quot;) for Windows users.

As was the case with &quot;CD-ROM Today&quot;, &quot;MacAddict&quot;&#x27;s discs included shareware and demo programs, but also came with other added features, such as staff videos and previews of content inside the magazine&#x27;s hard copy. The &quot;MacAddict&quot; website was updated daily with news relevant to Apple products. &quot;MacAddict&quot; also had a mascot, a stick-figure named Max. By 1998, &quot;MacAddict&quot; had surpassed &quot;Macworld&quot; as the Macintosh magazine with the highest consumer newsstand spending due to its $7.99 cover price.

In February 2007, &quot;MacAddict&quot; was relaunched as &quot;MacLife&quot;. The new magazine had physically larger print editions than the old magazine, was focused on the creativity of Mac users, and no longer came with a CD-ROM.

In April 2023, &quot;MacLife&quot; issued its last print edition and switched to a digital-only format.

In Germany, an unrelated magazine of the same name is published by &quot;Falkemedia&quot; from Kiel ().

==Reviewing system==
From 1996 to mid-2002, there were four rating icons, which depicted Max. There was &quot;Blech&quot; (the lowest), &quot;Yeah, Whatever&quot; (a mediocre product), &quot;Spiffy&quot; (a solid yet imperfect product), and &quot;Freakin&#x27; Awesome&quot; (the highest). From 2002 to 2009, it was replaced with a more conventional five-point system. In 2010, &quot;MacLife&quot; adopted a 10-point system that included half stars.

<doc id="285344" wikidata="Q865867" url="?curid=285344" title="Dining philosophers problem">
<text>In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.

It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals.
Soon after, Tony Hoare gave the problem its present form.

==Problem statement==
Five philosophers dine together at the same table. Each philosopher has their own plate at the table. There is a fork between each plate. The dish served is a kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with two forks. Each philosopher can only alternately think and eat. Moreover, a philosopher can only eat their spaghetti when they have both a left and right fork. Thus two forks will only be available when their two nearest neighbors are thinking, not eating. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they will put down both forks.
The problem is how to design a regimen (a concurrent algorithm) such that any philosopher will not starve; &quot;i.e.&quot;, each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think (an issue of incomplete information).

===Problems===

The problem was designed to illustrate the challenges of avoiding deadlock, a system state in which no progress is possible. To see that a proper solution to this problem is not obvious, consider a proposal in which each philosopher is instructed to behave as follows:

* think unless the left fork is available; when it is, pick it up;
* think unless the right fork is available; when it is, pick it up;
* when both forks are held, eat for a fixed amount of time;
* put the left fork down;
* put the right fork down;
* repeat from the beginning.

With these instructions, the situation may arise where each philosopher holds the fork to their left; in that situation, they will all be stuck forever, waiting for the other fork to be available: it is a deadlock.

Resource starvation, mutual exclusion and livelock are other types of sequence and access problems.

==Solutions==
These four conditions are necessary for a deadlock to occur: &quot;mutual exclusion&quot; (no fork can be simultaneously used by multiple philosophers), &quot;resource holding&quot; (the philosophers hold a fork while waiting for the second), &quot;non-preemption&quot; (no philosopher can take a fork from another), and &quot;circular wait&quot; (each philosopher may be waiting on the philosopher to their left). A solution must negate at least one of those four conditions. In practice, negating mutual exclusion or non-preemption somehow can give a valid solution, but most theoretical treatments assume that those assumptions are non-negotiable, instead attacking resource holding or circular waiting (often both).

=== Dijkstra&#x27;s solution ===

Dijkstra&#x27;s solution negates resource holding; the philosophers atomically pick up both forks or wait, never holding exactly one fork outside of a critical section. To accomplish this, Dijkstra&#x27;s solution uses one mutex, one semaphore per philosopher and one state variable per philosopher. This solution is more complex than the resource hierarchy solution. This is a C++20 version of Dijkstra&#x27;s solution with Tanenbaum&#x27;s changes:

#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;mutex&gt;
#include &lt;random&gt;
#include &lt;semaphore&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;

constexpr const size_t N = 5; // number of philosophers (and forks)
enum class State 
 THINKING = 0, // philosopher is THINKING
 HUNGRY = 1, // philosopher is trying to get forks
 EATING = 2, // philosopher is EATING

size_t inline left(size_t i) 
 // number of the left neighbor of philosopher i, for whom both forks are available
 return (i - 1 + N) % N; // N is added for the case when i - 1 is negative

size_t inline right(size_t i) 
 // number of the right neighbor of the philosopher i, for whom both forks are available
 return (i + 1) % N;

State state[N]; // array to keep track of everyone&#x27;s both_forks_available state

std::mutex critical_region_mtx; // mutual exclusion for critical regions for 
// (picking up and putting down the forks)
std::mutex output_mtx; // for synchronized cout (printing THINKING/HUNGRY/EATING status)

// array of binary semaphors, one semaphore per philosopher.
// Acquired semaphore means philosopher i has acquired (blocked) two forks
std::binary_semaphore both_forks_available[N]
 std::binary_semaphore{0}, std::binary_semaphore{0},
 std::binary_semaphore{0}, std::binary_semaphore{0},
 std::binary_semaphore{0}

size_t my_rand(size_t min, size_t max) 
 static std::mt19937 rnd(std::time(nullptr));
 return std::uniform_int_distribution&lt;&gt;(min, max)(rnd);

void test(size_t i) 
// if philosopher i is hungry and both neighbors are not eating then eat
 // i: philosopher number, from 0 to N-1
 if (state[i] == State::HUNGRY &amp;&amp;
 state[left(i)] != State::EATING &amp;&amp;
 state[right(i)] != State::EATING) 
 state[i] = State::EATING;
 both_forks_available[i].release(); // forks are no longer needed for this eat session
}

void think(size_t i) 
 size_t duration = my_rand(400, 800);
 std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lk(output_mtx); // critical section for uninterrupted print
 std::cout « i « &quot; is thinking &quot; « duration « &quot;ms\n&quot;;
 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(duration));

void take_forks(size_t i)
 {
 std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lk{critical_region_mtx}; // enter critical region
 state[i] = State::HUNGRY; // record fact that philosopher i is State::HUNGRY
 std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lk(output_mtx); // critical section for uninterrupted print
 std::cout « &quot;\t\t&quot; « i « &quot; is State::HUNGRY\n&quot;;
 test(i); // try to acquire (a permit for) 2 forks
 } // exit critical region
 both_forks_available[i].acquire(); // block if forks were not acquired

void eat(size_t i)
 size_t duration = my_rand(400, 800);
 std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lk(output_mtx); // critical section for uninterrupted print
 std::cout « &quot;\t\t\t\t&quot; « i « &quot; is eating &quot; « duration « &quot;ms\n&quot;;
 std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(duration));

void put_forks(size_t i) 
 
 std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lk{critical_region_mtx}; // enter critical region
 state[i] = State::THINKING; // philosopher has finished State::EATING
 test(left(i)); // see if left neighbor can now eat
 test(right(i)); // see if right neighbor can now eat
 // exit critical region by exiting the function

void philosopher(size_t i)
 while (true) 
 { // repeat forever
 think(i); // philosopher is State::THINKING
 take_forks(i); // acquire two forks or block
 eat(i); // yum-yum, spaghetti
 put_forks(i); // put both forks back on table and check if neighbors can eat
}

int main() {
 std::cout « &quot;dp_14\n&quot;;

 std::jthread t0([&amp;] { philosopher(0); }); // [&amp;] means every variable outside the ensuing lambda 
 std::jthread t1([&amp;] { philosopher(1); }); // is captured by reference
 std::jthread t2([&amp;] { philosopher(2); });
 std::jthread t3([&amp;] { philosopher(3); });
 std::jthread t4([&amp;] { philosopher(4); });

The function test() and its use in take_forks() and put_forks() make the Dijkstra solution deadlock-free.

=== Resource hierarchy solution ===

This solution negates circular waiting by assigning a partial order to the resources (the forks, in this case), and establishes the convention that all resources will be requested in order, and that no two resources unrelated by order will ever be used by a single unit of work at the same time. Here, the resources (forks) will be numbered 1 through 5 and each unit of work (philosopher) will always pick up the lower-numbered fork first, and then the higher-numbered fork, from among the two forks he plans to use. The order in which each philosopher puts down the forks does not matter. In this case, if four of the five philosophers simultaneously pick up their lower-numbered forks, only the highest-numbered fork will remain on the table, so the fifth philosopher will not be able to pick up any fork. Moreover, only one philosopher will have access to that highest-numbered fork, so he will be able to eat using two forks. This can intuitively be thought of as having one &quot;left-handed&quot; philosopher at the table, who – unlike all the other philosophers – takes his fork from the left first.

While the resource hierarchy solution avoids deadlocks, it is not always practical, especially when the list of required resources is not completely known in advance. For example, if a unit of work holds resources 3 and 5 and then determines it needs resource 2, it must release 5, then 3 before acquiring 2, and then it must re-acquire 3 and 5 in that order. Computer programs that access large numbers of database records would not run efficiently if they were required to release all higher-numbered records before accessing a new record, making the method impractical for that purpose.

The resource hierarchy solution is not &quot;fair&quot;. If philosopher 1 is slow to take a fork, and if philosopher 2 is quick to think and pick its forks back up, then philosopher 1 will never get to pick up both forks. A fair solution must guarantee that each philosopher will eventually eat, no matter how slowly that philosopher moves relative to the others.

The following source code is a C++11 implementation of the resource hierarchy solution for five philosophers. The sleep_for() function simulates the time normally spent with business logic.

For GCC: compile with g++ src.cpp -std=c++11 -lpthread
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;mutex&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;random&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;

using namespace std;

int myrand(int min, int max) {
 static mt19937 rnd(time(nullptr));
 return uniform_int_distribution&lt;&gt;(min,max)(rnd);

void philosopher(int ph, mutex&amp; ma, mutex&amp; mb, mutex&amp; mo) {
 for (;;) { // prevent thread from termination
 int duration = myrand(200, 800);
 // Block { } limits scope of lock
 lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; gmo(mo);
 cout«ph«&quot; thinks &quot;«duration«&quot;ms\n&quot;;
 this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(duration));
 lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; gmo(mo);
 cout«&quot;\t\t&quot;«ph«&quot; is hungry\n&quot;;
 lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; gma(ma);
 // sleep_for() Delay before seeking second fork can be added here but should not be required.
 lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; gmb(mb);
 duration = myrand(200, 800);
 lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; gmo(mo);
 cout«&quot;\t\t\t\t&quot;«ph«&quot; eats &quot;«duration«&quot;ms\n&quot;;
 this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(duration));
}

int main() {
 cout«&quot;dining Philosophers C++11 with Resource hierarchy\n&quot;;
 mutex m1, m2, m3, m4, m5; // 5 forks are 5 mutexes
 mutex mo; // for proper output
 // 5 philosophers are 5 threads
 thread t1([&amp;] {philosopher(1, m1, m2, mo);});
 thread t2([&amp;] {philosopher(2, m2, m3, mo);});
 thread t3([&amp;] {philosopher(3, m3, m4, mo);}); 
 thread t4([&amp;] {philosopher(4, m4, m5, mo);}); 
 thread t5([&amp;] {philosopher(5, m1, m5, mo);}); // Force a resource hierarchy
 t1.join(); // prevent threads from termination
 t2.join();
 t3.join();
 t4.join();
 t5.join();

=== Arbitrator solution ===
Another approach is to guarantee that a philosopher can only pick up both forks or none by introducing an arbitrator to replace circular waiting, e.g., a waiter. In order to pick up the forks, a philosopher must ask permission of the waiter. The waiter gives permission to only one philosopher at a time until the philosopher has picked up both of his forks. Putting down a fork is always allowed. The waiter can be implemented as a mutex.
In addition to introducing a new central entity (the waiter), this approach can result in reduced parallelism: if a philosopher is eating and one of his neighbors is requesting the forks, all other philosophers must wait until this request has been fulfilled even if forks for them are still available.
=== Limiting the number of diners in the table ===
A solution presented by William Stallings is to allow a maximum of &quot;n-1&quot; philosophers to sit down at any time. The last philosopher would have to wait (for example, using a semaphore) for someone to finish dining before he &quot;sits down&quot; and requests access to any fork. This negates circular wait, guaranteeing at least one philosopher may always acquire both forks, allowing the system to make progress.

=== Chandy/Misra solution ===
In 1984, K. Mani Chandy and J. Misra proposed a different solution to the dining philosophers problem to allow for arbitrary agents (numbered &quot;P&quot;1, ..., &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;) to contend for an arbitrary number of resources, unlike Dijkstra&#x27;s solution. It is also completely distributed and requires no central authority after initialization. However, it violates the requirement that &quot;the philosophers do not speak to each other&quot; (due to the request messages).

#For every pair of philosophers contending for a resource, create a fork and give it to the philosopher with the lower ID (&quot;n&quot; for agent &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Each fork can either be &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;clean.&quot; Initially, all forks are dirty.
#When a philosopher wants to use a set of resources (&quot;i.e.&quot;, eat), said philosopher must obtain the forks from his contending neighbors. For all such forks the philosopher does not have, he sends a request message.
#When a philosopher with a fork receives a request message, he keeps the fork if it is clean, but give it up when it is dirty. If the philosopher sends the fork over, he cleans the fork before doing so.
#After a philosopher is done eating, all his forks become dirty. If another philosopher had previously requested one of the forks, the philosopher that has just finished eating cleans the fork and sends it.

This solution also allows for a large degree of concurrency, and will solve an arbitrarily large problem.

It also solves the starvation problem. The clean/dirty labels act as a way of giving preference to the most &quot;starved&quot; processes, and a disadvantage to processes that have just &quot;eaten&quot;. One could compare their solution to one where philosophers are not allowed to eat twice in a row without letting others use the forks in between. Chandy and Misra&#x27;s solution is more flexible than that, but has an element tending in that direction.

In their analysis, they derive a system of preference levels from the distribution of the forks and their clean/dirty states. They show that this system may describe a directed acyclic graph, and if so, the operations in their protocol cannot turn that graph into a cyclic one. This guarantees that deadlock cannot occur by negating circular waiting. However, if the system is initialized to a perfectly symmetric state, like all philosophers holding their left side forks, then the graph is cyclic at the outset, and their solution cannot prevent a deadlock. Initializing the system so that philosophers with lower IDs have dirty forks ensures the graph is initially acyclic.

<text>Shadworth Hollway Hodgson, FBA (25 December 1832 – 13 June 1912) was an English philosopher.

==Biography==
He worked independently, without academic affiliation. He was acknowledged by William James as a forerunner of Pragmatism, although he viewed his work as a completion of Kant&#x27;s project. Hodgson was a member of a London philosophy club with James, called the &quot;Scratch Eight&quot;. Hodgson regarded the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as his chief inspirations, and had no academic background, though he was a member of the Metaphysical Society.

He was the first president of the Aristotelian Society and held that post from 1880 to 1894.

His principal work was &quot;The Metaphysic of Experience&quot; (1898) which prepared the way for New Realism. He objected to the stance of empiricism in its postulating of persons and things, and insisted that neither subject nor object are warranted as initial considerations of philosophy.

He died on 13 June 1912.

Hodgson believed in what he called the principle of reflective consciousness, namely that &quot;A thing is what it is known as, this is the principle in its objective formula; &#x27;the objective and subjective aspects are inseparable,&#x27; this is its subjective formula, expressing the way in which the same truth appears in reflection itself.&quot;.

Attention to Hodgson was briefly enlivened by an article by Wolfe Mays in a British phenomenology journal in the 1970s.

The volumes of Hodgson&#x27;s principal work were often shipped with uncut pages and visits to libraries with these volumes has revealed that sometimes most pages of all 4 volumes remained uncut even one hundred years later.

<text>Katherine Mary Govier (born July 4, 1948) is a Canadian novelist and essayist.

==Biography==
Katherine Govier was born in Edmonton, Alberta, and was educated at the University of Alberta and York University. She has been made a Distinguished Alumna of the University of Alberta and is one of York University&#x27;s &quot;Famous Fifty&quot; graduates. She has been Chair of the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada and President of PEN Canada. Govier has published essays in major newspapers and magazines, including Maclean&#x27;s, Saturday Night, The Globe and Mail, Harper&#x27;s, Queen, and The Toronto Star.

Govier was shortlisted for the Trillium Award in 1994, and won the City of Toronto Book Award in 1992. In 1997, she was awarded the Marian Engel Award for a woman writer in mid-career. Her novel &quot;Creation&quot; was a New York Times Notable Book of 2003. Her 2010 novel, &quot;The Ghost Brush&quot;, focusing on the life of Katsushika Oi, has been published in translation in French as &quot;La Femme Hokusai&quot;, in Japanese as &quot;Hokusai Tu Oi&quot;, in Spanish as &quot;La Hija del Dibujante&quot;, in Romanian as &quot;Fiica Lui Hokusai&quot;, and in the United States under the title &quot;The Printmaker&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In 2014, Lori Saint-Martin and Paul Gagne were nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s award for translation 2014 for their translation of &quot;The Ghost Brush&quot; into French as &quot;La Femme Hokusai&quot;, published by Quebec-Amerique.

In 2011, she wrote an article for the Ottawa Citizen about a New York Times article on the disparity of female to male writers who contribute to the writing and editing of Wikipedia. Govier also founded The Shoe Project, a writing workshop for immigrant women, with sponsorship from Heather Gardiner and hosting by The Bata Shoe Museum. The group publishes stories on the web, creates &#x27;snapshot&#x27; exhibits for The Bata Shoe Museum, and offers public performances. It has been the subject of two one-hour documentaries on CBC Ideas, In Their Shoes I (February 27, 2012), and In Their Shoes II (June 10, 2013), and a Toronto Star article.

In April 2014, Govier&#x27;s anthology &quot;Half for You and Half For Me: Nursery Rhymes and the Stories Behind Them&quot;, with illustrations by Sarah Clement, was published by Whitecap Publishers.

==Personal life==

<text>The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is an open communication protocol that enables chess engines to communicate with user interfaces.

==History==
In November 2000, the UCI protocol was released. Designed by Rudolf Huber and Stefan Meyer-Kahlen, the author of Shredder, UCI rivals the older &quot;Chess Engine Communication Protocol&quot; introduced with XBoard/WinBoard.

In 2002, Chessbase, the chess software company which markets Fritz, began to support UCI, which had previously been supported by only a few interfaces and engines.

, well over 300 engines are known to directly support UCI.

==Design==
By design, UCI assigns some tasks to the user interface (i.e., presentation layer) which have traditionally been handled by the engine (at the business layer) itself.

Most notably, the opening book is usually expected to be handled by the UI, by simply selecting moves to play until it is out of book, and only then starting up the engine for calculation in the resulting position. UCI does not specify any on-disk format for the opening book. Different UIs usually have their own proprietary formats.

While the UI can also take responsibility for handling endgame tablebases, this is arguably better handled in the engine itself, as having tablebase information can be useful for considering possible future positions.

Stefan-Meyer Kahlen&#x27;s UCI protocol in Shredder uses a variation of long algebraic notation for moves. A &quot;nullmove&quot; from an engine to a GUI should be sent as 0000.

;Examples:
*e2e4
*e7e5
*e1g1 (white short castling)
*e7e8q (for promotion)

==Features==
The uci_limitstrength parameter tells engines with this feature to play at a lower level. The uci_elo parameter specifies the Elo rating at which the engine will aim to play. Engines that have implemented uci_elo include Delfi, Fritz, Hiarcs, Houdini, Junior, Rybka, Shredder, Sjeng and Stockfish.

==Variants==
The UCI has been modified to play some chess variants. Some of these are:
* Universal Shogi Interface (USI), a dialect for shogi;
* Universal Chinese Chess Interface (UCCI), a dialect for xiangqi.

Each of these protocols may also define variants of Portable Game Notation (PGN) and Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN). The XBoard CECP is said to require far fewer changes to support variants.

<text>James Bolivar diGriz, alias &quot;Slippery Jim&quot; and &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, is a fictional character and a series of comic science fiction novels written by Harry Harrison.

==Description==
James Bolivar diGriz goes by many aliases, including &quot;Slippery Jim&quot; and &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;. He is a futuristic con man, thief, and all-round rascal. He is charming and quick-witted. He is also a master of disguise and martial arts, an accomplished bank robber, a criminal mastermind, an expert on breaking and entering, and (perhaps most usefully) a skilled liar. Master of self-rationalization, the Rat frequently justifies his crimes by arguing that he is providing society with entertainment; and besides which, he only steals from institutions that he believes have insurance coverage and so will be able to recoup their losses. He displays a strong sense of morality, albeit in a much more restricted sense than is traditional. For example, diGriz will steal without compunction, but deplores killing.

The character was introduced in Harrison&#x27;s short story &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, first published in 1957 in &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine. The story introduces the Rat, who has just carried out a successful larceny operation, and subsequently details a complex bank robbery the Rat pulls off with ease; however, he is outfoxed by the mysterious &quot;Special Corps&quot;—a crime-fighting organization staffed with former criminals—and recruited by them in order to fight crime. Harrison used the story, with minor modifications, as the introduction to the series&#x27;s first full-length novel, also called &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;. Like other characters created by Harrison, the Rat is a speaker of Esperanto and advocates atheism.

==Books==
There are 12 works in the Stainless Steel Rat series.

: &quot;The Adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat&quot; (1978) anthologized the first three books: 
: &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Omnibus&quot; (2008) anthologized the first three books: (Gollancz)

The series takes place in the far future (to the point where the name of the original homeworld of humankind has been lost.) According to professor Coypu, the Gregorian calendar is no longer in use (with no mention of what replaced it), but &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World&quot; provides a timeframe for the Rat&#x27;s life and adventures when DiGriz is sent 32,598 years into the past and arrives in 1975 A.D., which would place the events of the series around the late 346th century.

==Spin-offs==

===Comics===
&quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World&quot; and &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat for President&quot; were adapted into comic strip form in early issues of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, written by Kelvin Gosnell and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra. Ezquerra drew Jim with an appearance modelled on the actor James Coburn. They appeared in the following issues of &quot;2000 AD&quot;:

* &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, 12 episodes, 2000 AD progs 140–151 (Nov. 1979 to Feb. 1980).
* &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World&quot;, 12 episodes, 2000 AD progs 166–177 (June to Sep. 1980).
* &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat for President&quot;, 12 episodes, 2000 AD progs 393–404 (Nov. 1984 to Feb. 1985).

The first appearance of The Stainless Steel Rat in prog 140 was supposed to be preceded with a brief panel of explanation of who Jim was. However, an editorial error meant that the panel actually appeared at the end of the first episode, not the beginning. This prompted a letter to be printed in prog 148 from Harry Harrison himself pointing out the error, for which he won £3.

These three stories were colorized and reprinted by Eagle Comics in 1985 and 1986 as a six-issue limited series. They were also collected in a trade paperback in July 2010 ().

The &quot;2000 AD&quot; comic versions were collected into a paperback () and hardcover edition in August 2021 which includes the colour centre spreads as they originally appeared.

===Books===

====Gamebook====
Harrison also produced a gamebook in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy series, called &quot;You Can Be the Stainless Steel Rat&quot; (), the reader being told that their decisions would &quot;determine whether he or she can find Prof. Geisteskrank on the planet Skraldespand and bring him back before he activates a lethal new weapon&quot;. The reader generally cannot fail in this mission, regardless of his or her choices, although it is possible to get caught in an inescapable at one point.

====Cameos====
In the tribute anthology &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends&quot;, Harrison wrote a story, &quot;The Fourth Law of Robotics&quot;, which featured the Stainless Steel Rat in the setting of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot; Robot&quot; series.

===Board game===
&quot;The Return of the Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, a board game inspired by the character, was published by SPI in their magazine &quot;Ares&quot; in the late 1970s. Designed by Greg Costikyan, the game involved the Rat infiltrating a space station under hostile control. The game was accompanied by a 6,000-word short story.

===Video games===
In 1984 a &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; video game was developed by Mosaic Publishing for the ZX Spectrum, co-written by Harrison with programmer Sean O&#x27;Connell.

A text adventure game titled &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World&quot; was released in 1984 for the Commodore 64.

==Characters==
===Angelina diGriz===
Angelina diGriz is a criminal mastermind much like the Rat, only less ethical and more willing to kill. As the Rat&#x27;s first case for the Special Corps, he tracks Angelina down and ends up falling in love with her. After her capture, she undergoes psycho surgery (not to be mistaken for &quot;psychic surgery&quot;) to lessen her homicidal tendencies and she also joins the Corps; during that time she begins a relationship with the Rat that ends with them marrying in the last trimester of her pregnancy. She later assists on many of the Rat&#x27;s adventures, often providing advice and solutions that Jim himself is unable to see. While she is no longer a heartless killer, her suppressed homicidal tendencies occasionally come out, especially when she sees another woman near her husband.

===James and Bolivar diGriz===
James and Bolivar diGriz are the twin sons of the Rat and Angelina. The Rat missed most of the first six years of their life because of his adventures in time (he briefly sees them as babies at the end of &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&#x27;s Revenge&quot;), but they share their father&#x27;s attitudes and many of his skills. They end up marrying the same woman, who falls in love with both of them and gets herself duplicated into two identical women sharing one mind.

===Harold Peters Inskipp===
Harold Peters Inskipp is the director of the Special Corps and one of the most powerful men in the Galaxy. He recruits the Rat, but is frequently infuriated by his insubordinate attitude and tendency to go rogue – committing independent crimes for sheer enjoyment. The Special Corps is composed almost entirely of former criminals – Inskipp himself was a legendary fugitive known as &quot;Inskipp the Uncatchable&quot; before being recruited and eventually becoming the Corps&#x27;s commander.

===Professor Coypu===
One of the few Special Corps members not taken from the criminal fraternity, Professor Coypu is a boffin who had developed a Time Helix device permitting time travel as well as a portal to alternate realities. He also has a great deal of general scientific knowledge, and sent a copy of his mind with the Rat on his excursion to the 20th century to enable Jim to build a time helix and return to his native time. The only descriptions given of Coypu are his prominent buck teeth - a trait he shares with his namesake, the coypu - and a large nose. 

===The Bishop===
The Bishop was a master criminal on &quot;Bit O&#x27;Heaven&quot;, the Stainless Steel Rat&#x27;s home planet. He was a lot less physical in his capers than Jim but undertook robberies, always leaving as his calling card a picture of the bishop chess piece. He retired from robbery before Jim was born, focusing instead on computer crime, and Jim only learned of his existence from a fellow prisoner while briefly in jail. Jim then contacted The Bishop by using his calling card in a robbery. As a result, The Bishop was forced out of retirement when he underestimated the police&#x27;s computer security systems after running a check on Jim himself. The Bishop eventually became Jim&#x27;s mentor and taught him a great deal about their trade, as well as a code of ethics. Eventually Jim and The Bishop had to leave &quot;Bit O&#x27;Heaven&quot; and on their first off-planet adventure The Bishop was killed. As a parting gift he left Jim a note that he signed with his real name, although the name is not revealed to the reader.

===The Kekkonshiki===
The Kekkonshiki, also known as &quot;The Gray Men&quot;, are a human culture who initially prefer domination to coexistence. Their expertise lies in using technology to manipulate sentient minds, and they have manipulated both humans and aliens on a grand scale. Jim has experienced one of their techniques, in which the subject is convinced, via an implanted memory and faked surgical scars, that their hands were severed by an axe and then reattached while they were unconscious from the shock; he later becomes aware of their involvement in the alien invasion when he sees the same marks on the wrists of another prisoner. Jim has knowingly opposed them on two separate occasions (&quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You&quot;), but in the latter novel he is informed that he has in fact thwarted their plans twice already, making this their third encounter. (An alternate reading of the text is that finding and infiltrating their homeworld, in the second half of the novel, is counted separately from stopping the alien invasion in the first half.) They live on a harsh, icy world, which forced them to eliminate all emotion from their culture. This society is completely patriarchal, with women being treated as nothing more than property. During Jim&#x27;s interactions with Hanasu - a disgraced Kekkonshiki council leader - he persuades them to reinterpret their teachings, and they embark on a more peaceful co-existence with the rest of humanity. (&quot;Kekkonshiki&quot; is the romanization of the Japanese word for &quot;Marriage Ceremony&quot; 結婚式. Also, while on their homeworld, Jim follows a technician into a room marked &quot;Benjo&quot;, which turns out to be a bathroom; &quot;Benjo&quot; is Japanese for water closet/toilet.)

==In popular culture==
The MIT class ring, commonly referred to as &quot;The Brass Rat&quot;, when cast in Celestrium (also known as jeweler&#x27;s steel), is often referred to as &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot;.

The Chinese activist Liu Di, writing under the screen name &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; (不锈钢老鼠), became a high-profile symbol for democracy and free speech in China since her detention in November 2002. Her screen name is often translated as Stainless Steel Mouse.

In &quot;The Librarians&quot; episode &quot;And the Happily Ever Afters&quot;, Flynn Carsen refers to Ezekiel Jones, a thief, &quot;master of technologies&quot; as the &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot;.

In Obsidian&#x27;s The Outer Worlds a side quest is titled &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat.&quot;

A character in Digital Extremes&#x27; Warframe refers to the exoskeleton-wearing player characters as &quot;stainless steel rats.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the first novel four stars out of five, saying &quot;though pure entertainment, [it] underlines SF&#x27;s role in providing speculative thought about potential problems.&quot;

&quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot; has been cited as Julian Assange&#x27;s favourite novel, and having influenced the real-life outlaw Jim Clay &quot;Ether&quot; Harper VI.

<doc id="285362" wikidata="Q1190923" url="?curid=285362" title="Squash (drink)">
<text>Squash (sometimes known as cordial in British English, dilute in Hiberno English, diluting juice in Scottish English, and water juice in the Northern Isles of Scotland), is a non-alcoholic beverage with syrup used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and sugar or a sugar substitute. Modern squashes may also contain food colouring and additional flavouring. Some traditional squashes contain herbal extracts, most notably elderflower and ginger.

==Drinks==
Squash is mixed with a certain amount of water or carbonated water before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a drink mixer, it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a cocktail.

Citrus fruits (particularly orange, lime and lemon) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.

Traditional squashes in Britain are usually flavoured with elderflower, orange, lemon, or blackcurrant. Raspberry and blackberry are popular in Eastern Europe, and currants is a common ingredient in the Low Countries.

==Preparation==
Squash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water (carbonated or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are mixed with nine parts water to one part concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water.

===Storage===
Most cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators.

==Ingredients==
Ingredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5–10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.

===Flavourings===
Traditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry.

Modern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon.

==Terminology==
&quot;Cordial&quot;, &quot;diluting juice&quot;, and &quot;squash&quot; are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended. In British English, &quot;cordial&quot; refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup). &quot;High juice&quot; is a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%.

Squash is often colloquially known as &quot;juice&quot;. However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called &quot;fruit drink&quot;, especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., Fruit Shoot).

==Fruit juice content==
Squashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as &quot;high juice&quot;, and squashes are quite often called &quot;juice&quot; when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5–10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state &quot;with real fruit juice&quot; on the label.

==World markets==

Cordial is popular in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. It is not widely consumed in the United States.

Notable companies producing squash include Britvic (under the Robinsons, MiWadi and Teisseire brands), Hamdard (under the Rooh Afza brand in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), Nichols (under the Vimto brand), Suntory (under the Ribena brand) and Coca-Cola (under the Kia-Ora brand). Australian brands include Cottee&#x27;s, Bickford&#x27;s, P&amp;N Beverages and Golden Circle cordials. Indian brands include Rasna. In Israel, fruit squashes are produced by such companies as Prigat.

==Animal consumption==
The gorillas at London Zoo are given both squash and cold fruit tea to drink. When a silverback called Kumbuka escaped from his enclosure in 2016, he drank of undiluted blackcurrant squash that was in the keepers&#x27; area.

<text>The River Dart is a river in Devon, England, that rises high on Dartmoor and flows for to the sea at Dartmouth.

==Name==
Most hydronyms in England derive from the Brythonic language (from which the river&#x27;s subsequent names ultimately derive from an original Celtic etymology. As the lower stretches of the river are still covered in ancient oak woodlands, it is accepted that the first element derives from *Dar-, meaning oak (derow&quot;, Welsh &quot;derw&quot;). However the second element (evident in the hard consonantal termination of &quot;Dar-t&quot;) is less certain, with postulated etymologies from &quot;Darwent&quot; / &quot;Derventio&quot; (Sacred place of Oak) or &quot;Darnant&quot; / &quot;Darant&quot; (Oak stream).

The Ravenna Cosmography records a number of Latinised names for the area, &quot;Devionisso Statio&quot; and &quot;Deventiasteno&quot; may represent corrupted doublets of a &quot;Statio&quot; (Station) on a river named &quot;Derventio&quot;. Although the name &quot;Derventio&quot; is otherwise unattested for the river, it is an established etymology throughout Britain, found at the River Darent, Derwentwater, and a number of rivers named Derwent. Anna Eliza Bray recorded that a version of the name, &quot;Darant&quot; was still in common usage as late as 1832.

==Watercourse==
The river begins as two separate branches (the East Dart and West Dart), which join at Dartmeet. The paths along these rivers offer very attractive walking, and there are several small waterfalls. The rivers are crossed by a number of clapper bridges, notably at the hamlet of Postbridge.

After leaving the moor, the Dart flows southwards past Buckfast Abbey and through the towns of Buckfastleigh, Dartington and Totnes. At Totnes, where there is a seventeenth-century weir (rebuilt in the 1960s), it becomes tidal, and there are no bridges below the town.

A passenger ferry operates across the river from the village of Dittisham to a point adjacent to the Greenway Estate. Formerly the home of the crime writer Agatha Christie, this has views across the river, and the house and gardens are now owned by the National Trust and are open to the public.

The entrance to the river from the sea is a rocky entrance with cliffs either side. On the East side Kingswear Castle sits very close to the water&#x27;s edge, and on the west side Dartmouth Castle is built on a rocky promontory at sea level. The castles once operated a defensive chain across the estuary, which was raised at dusk to destroy enemy ships attempting to attack the harbour.

==Crossings==

The flooded ria that forms the lower reaches of the Dart, with its deep water and steeply sloping valley sides, is a considerable barrier to crossing traffic. There are no bridges below Totnes.

At the mouth of the river, it separates the communities of Dartmouth and Kingswear. There have been proposals to bridge the river here, but these have come to nothing. Instead the two places are linked by, in order going upstream, the Lower Ferry, Passenger Ferry and Higher Ferry. The Lower and Higher ferries both carry vehicles, the Higher one linking the A379 road.

Some upstream of Dartmouth, the Greenway Ferry carries pedestrians across the river from the village of Dittisham to Greenway Quay.

A further upstream is Totnes, where the river is spanned by two road bridges, a railway bridge and a footbridge over. Totnes Bridge is the nearest bridge to the sea and is a road bridge built in 1826–1828 by Charles Fowler. Some upstream is Brutus Bridge, constructed in 1982 as part of a road traffic-relief scheme and carrying the concurrent A385 and A381 roads. A further upstream, the railway bridge carries the National Rail Exeter to Plymouth line over the river. Immediately upstream of the railway bridge is a footbridge, built in 1993 to provide access to the terminus of the South Devon Railway.

==Navigation==
The lower section of the River Dart forms Dartmouth Harbour, a deep water natural harbour with a long history of maritime usage. In modern times, the port&#x27;s commercial activity has declined, but it is still a busy port for local fishing vessels and a wide variety of yachts and other private boats. Several local companies specialise in shipbuilding and repairs to small tonnage craft.

Dartmouth is also the home of the Britannia Royal Naval College and as a result is routinely visited by sizeable naval ships. Smaller naval tenders are often seen carrying out training exercises in the harbour and river. Large cruise ships are occasional visitors, with the largest visitor to date being the ().

Upstream, the Dart is navigable to seagoing vessels as far as the weir in Totnes. The river almost dries out for below Totnes at spring tide low water, but vessels drawing up to can proceed to Totnes from one and a half hours after low water. Above the weir, the river is navigable only to small craft such as kayaks and canoes.

Several companies operate trips on the river, including Dart Pleasure Craft Limited, who also trade as &quot;River Link&quot; and operate the passenger ferry between Dartmouth and Kingswear. These include cruises from Dartmouth to Totnes, which can be combined with journeys on the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway and an open-top bus between the towns of Totnes and Paignton to create a circular trip.

The harbour and port are both leisure boating locations, and several marinas and boat yards are located on the river. The Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta takes place annually over three days at the end of August.

==Canoeing and kayaking==

The upper reaches of Dartmoor, especially those on the Dart, are a focal point for whitewater kayakers and canoeists. The best known sections of the river are:
* &quot;Upper Dart&quot; from Dartmeet to Newbridge (Grade 3/4 (higher in high water), advanced run).
* &quot;The Loop&quot; from Newbridge to Holne Bridge (Grade 2/3, beginner/intermediate run).
* &quot;The Lower&quot; from Holne Bridge to Buckfastleigh (Grade 2, beginner section).
Sections of the East and West Dart above Dartmeet, as well as the Webburn are also paddled when conditions permit. This is somewhat controversial, as riparian landowners and those responsible for local fisheries maintain that the East and West Dart should not be paddled.

The lower reaches of the Dart, including the estuary are suitable for flat water touring.

<doc id="285370" wikidata="Q1151304" url="?curid=285370" title="Low-noise amplifier">
<text>A low-noise amplifier (LNA) is an electronic component that amplifies a very low-power signal without significantly degrading its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Any electronic amplifier will increase the power of both the signal and the noise present at its input, but the amplifier will also introduce some additional noise. LNAs are designed to minimize that additional noise, by choosing special components, operating points, and circuit topologies. Minimizing additional noise must balance with other design goals such as power gain and impedance matching.

LNAs are found in radio communications systems, Amateur Radio stations, medical instruments and electronic test equipment. A typical LNA may supply a power gain of 100 (20 decibels (dB)) while decreasing the SNR by less than a factor of two (a 3 dB noise figure (NF)). Although LNAs are primarily concerned with weak signals that are just above the noise floor, they must also consider the presence of larger signals that cause intermodulation distortion.

== Communications ==
Antennas are a common source of weak signals. An outdoor antenna is often connected to its receiver by a transmission line called a &quot;feed line&quot;. Losses in the feed line lower the received signal-to-noise ratio: a feed line loss of degrades the receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by .

An example is a feed line made from of RG-174 coaxial cable and used with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. The loss in that feed line is at ; approximately at the GPS frequency (). This feed line loss can be avoided by placing an LNA at the antenna, which supplies enough gain to offset the loss.

An LNA is a key component at the front-end of a radio receiver circuit to help reduce unwanted noise in particular. Friis&#x27; formulas for noise models the noise in a multi-stage signal collection circuit. In most receivers, the overall NF is dominated by the first few stages of the RF front end.

By using an LNA close to the signal source, the effect of noise from subsequent stages of the receive chain in the circuit is reduced by the signal gain created by the LNA, while the noise created by the LNA itself is injected directly into the received signal. The LNA boosts the desired signals&#x27; power while adding as little noise and distortion as possible. The work done by the LNA enables optimum retrieval of the desired signal in the later stages of the system.

== Design considerations ==
Low noise amplifiers are the building blocks of communication systems and instruments. The most important LNA specifications or attributes are:
* Gain
* Noise figure
* Linearity
* Maximum RF input

A good LNA has a low NF (e.g. ), enough gain to boost the signal (e.g. ) and a large enough inter-modulation and compression point (IP3 and P1dB) to do the work required of it. Further specifications are the LNA&#x27;s operating bandwidth, gain flatness, stability, input and output voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR).

For low noise, a high amplification is required for the amplifier in the first stage. Therefore, junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) and high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are often used. They are driven in a high-current regime, which is not energy-efficient but reduces the relative amount of shot noise. It also requires input and output impedance matching circuits for narrow-band circuits to enhance the gain (&quot;see Gain-bandwidth product&quot;).

=== Gain ===
Amplifiers need a device to provide gain. In the 1940s, that device was a vacuum tube, but now it is usually a transistor. The transistor may be one of many varieties of bipolar transistors or field-effect transistors. Other devices producing gain, such as tunnel diodes, may be used.

Broadly speaking, two categories of transistor models are used in LNA design: Small-signal models use quasi-linear models of noise and large-signal models consider non-linear mixing.

The amount of gain applied is often a compromise. On the one hand, high gain makes weak signals strong. On the other hand, high gain means higher-level signals, and such high-level signals with high gain may exceed the amplifier&#x27;s dynamic range or cause other types of noise such as harmonic distortion or nonlinear mixing.

===Noise figure===
The noise figure helps determine the efficiency of a particular LNA. LNA suitability for a particular application is typically based on its noise figure. In general, a low noise figure results in better signal reception.

=== Impedance ===
The circuit topology affects input and output impedance. In general, the source impedance is matched to the input impedance because that will maximize the power transfer from the source to the device. If the source impedance is low, then a common base or common gate circuit topology may be appropriate. For a medium source impedance, a common emitter or common source topology may be used. With a high source resistance, a common collector or common drain topology may be appropriate. An input impedance match may not produce the lowest noise figure. 

=== Biasing ===

Another design issue is the noise introduced by biasing networks. In communication circuits, biasing networks play a critical role in establishing stable operating points for active components, but they also introduce noise. The primary types of noise introduced by these networks are thermal noise and flicker noise. Thermal noise arises from resistive elements in the network, which is inevitable as any resistive component generates noise due to the random motion of charge carriers. This type of noise is especially problematic at high frequencies. Flicker noise, also known as 1/f noise, is related to the current flow through devices like transistors and becomes more significant at lower frequencies.

For instance, in low-noise amplifiers (LNA), the biasing network must be carefully designed to minimize the impact of noise on the overall performance. Improper biasing can lead to increased noise figures, compromising the signal-to-noise ratio and degrading communication system performance. The design and selection of components within the bias network are therefore crucial to ensuring low-noise operation, particularly in systems that rely on amplifying weak signals.

In addition, matching networks and careful biasing techniques, such as using low-noise transistors and optimizing impedance matching, help mitigate the noise effects introduced by bias circuits

== Applications ==
LNAs are used in communications receivers such as in radio telescopes, cellular telephones, GPS receivers, wireless LANs (WiFi), and satellite communications.

In a satellite communications system, the ground station receiving antenna uses an LNA because the received signal is weak since satellites have limited power and therefore use low-power transmitters. The satellites are also distant and suffer path loss: low Earth orbit satellites might be away; a geosynchronous satellite is away.

The LNA boosts the antenna signal to overcome feed line losses between the antenna and the receiver.

LNAs can enhance the performance of software-defined radio (SDR) receiver systems. SDRs are typically designed to be general purpose and therefore the noise figure is not optimized for any one particular application. With an LNA and appropriate filter, performance is improved over a range of frequencies.

<doc id="285374" wikidata="Q117553" url="?curid=285374" title="Modigliani–Miller theorem">
<text>The Modigliani–Miller theorem (of Franco Modigliani, Merton Miller) is an influential element of economic theory; it forms the basis for modern thinking on capital structure. The basic theorem states that in the absence of taxes, bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information, and in an efficient market, the enterprise value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed. This is not to be confused with the value of the equity of the firm. Since the value of the firm depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing shares or selling debt, the Modigliani–Miller theorem is often called the capital structure irrelevance principle.

The key Modigliani–Miller theorem was developed for a world without taxes. However, if we move to a world where there are taxes, when the interest on debt is tax-deductible, and ignoring other frictions, the value of the company increases in proportion to the amount of debt used. The additional value equals the total discounted value of future taxes saved by issuing debt instead of equity.

Modigliani was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Economics for this and other contributions.

Miller was a professor at the University of Chicago when he was awarded the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics, along with Harry Markowitz and William F. Sharpe, for their &quot;work in the theory of financial economics&quot;, with Miller specifically cited for &quot;fundamental contributions to the theory of corporate finance&quot;.

==Historical background==
Miller and Modigliani derived and published their theorem when they were both professors at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA) of Carnegie Mellon University. Despite limited prior experience in corporate finance, Miller and Modigliani were assigned to teach the subject to current business students. Finding the published material on the topic lacking, the professors created the theorem based on their own research. The result of this was the article in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; and what has later been known as the M&amp;M theorem.

Miller and Modigliani published a number of follow-up papers discussing some of these issues. The theorem was first proposed by F. Modigliani and M. Miller in 1958.

==The theorem==

Consider two firms which are identical except for their financial structures. The first (Firm U) is unlevered: that is, it is financed by equity only. The other (Firm L) is levered: it is financed partly by equity, and partly by debt. The Modigliani–Miller theorem states that the enterprise value of the two firms is the same. Enterprise value encompasses claims by both creditors and shareholders, and is not to be confused with the value of the equity of the firm.

The operational justification of the theorem can be visualized using the working of arbitrage. Consider that the two firms operate in a perfect capital market: both the firms are identical in all aspects except, one of the firms employ debt in its capital structure while the other doesn&#x27;t. Investors of the firm which has higher overall value can sell their stake and buy the stake in the firm whose value is lower. They will be able to earn the same return at a lower capital outlay and hence, lower perceived risk. Due to arbitrage, there would be an excess selling of the stake in the higher value firm bringing its price down, meanwhile for the lower value firm, due to the increased buying the price of its stake will rise. This corrects the market distortion, created by unequal risk amount and ultimately the value of both the firms will be leveled.

According to MM Hypothesis, the value of levered firm can never be higher than that of the unlevered firm. The two must be equal. There is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage in using debt in a firm&#x27;s capital structure.

==Without taxes==
===Proposition I===
formula_1

where

formula_2 &quot;is the value of an unlevered firm&quot; = price of buying a firm composed only of equity, and formula_3 &quot;is the value of a levered firm&quot; = price of buying a firm that is composed of some mix of debt and equity. Another word for levered is &quot;geared&quot;, which has the same meaning.

To see why this should be true, suppose an investor is considering buying one of the two firms, U or L. Instead of purchasing the shares of the levered firm L, he could purchase the shares of firm U and borrow the same amount of money B that firm L does. The eventual returns to either of these investments would be the same. Therefore the price of L must be the same as the price of U minus the money borrowed B, which is the value of L&#x27;s debt.

This discussion also clarifies the role of some of the theorem&#x27;s assumptions. We have implicitly assumed that the investor&#x27;s cost of borrowing money is the same as that of the firm, which need not be true in the presence of asymmetric information, in the absence of efficient markets, or if the investor has a different risk profile than the firm.

===Proposition II===
:formula_4

where

* formula_5 &quot;is the expected rate of return on equity of a leveraged firm, or cost of equity.&quot;
* formula_6 &quot;is the company cost of equity capital with no leverage (unlevered cost of equity, or return on assets with D/E = 0).&quot;
* formula_7 &quot;is the expected rate of return on borrowings, or cost of debt.&quot;
* formula_8 &quot;is the debt-to-equity ratio.&quot;

A higher debt-to-equity ratio leads to a higher required return on equity, because of the higher risk involved for equity-holders in a company with debt. The formula is derived from the theory of weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

These propositions are true under the following assumptions:
* no transaction costs exist, and
* individuals and corporations borrow at the same rates.

These results might seem irrelevant (after all, none of the conditions are met in the real world), but the theorem is still taught and studied because it tells something very important. That is, capital structure matters precisely because one or more of these assumptions is violated. It tells where to look for determinants of optimal capital structure and how those factors might affect optimal capital structure.

==With taxes==
===Proposition I===

:formula_9

where

* formula_3 &quot;is the value of a levered firm.&quot;
* formula_2 &quot;is the value of an unlevered firm.&quot;
* formula_12 &quot;is the tax rate (formula_13) x the value of debt (D)&quot;
 Derivation of formula_12- 
 Amount of Annual Interest= Debt x Interest Rate
 Annual Tax Shield= Debt x Interest Rate x Tax Rate
 Capitalisation Value (Perpetual Firm) = (Debt × Interest Rate x Tax Rate) ÷ Cost of Debt
* the term formula_12 assumes debt is perpetual

This means that there are advantages for firms to be levered, since corporations can deduct interest payments. Therefore leverage lowers tax payments. Dividend payments are non-deductible.

===Proposition II===
:formula_16

where:

* formula_5 &quot;is the required rate of return on equity, or cost of levered equity = unlevered equity + financing premium.&quot;
* formula_6 &quot;is the company cost of equity capital with no leverage (unlevered cost of equity, or return on assets with D/E = 0).&quot;
* formula_7 &quot;is the required rate of return on borrowings, or cost of debt.&quot;
* formula_20 &quot;is the debt-to-equity ratio.&quot;
* formula_21 &quot;is the tax rate.&quot;

The same relationship as earlier described stating that the cost of equity rises with leverage, because the risk to equity rises, still holds. The formula, however, has implications for the difference with the WACC. Their second attempt on capital structure included taxes has identified that as the level of gearing increases by replacing equity with cheap debt the level of the WACC drops and an optimal capital structure does indeed exist at a point where debt is 100%.

The following assumptions are made in the propositions with taxes:
* corporations are taxed at the rate formula_13 on earnings after interest,
* no transaction costs exist, and
* individuals and corporations borrow at the same rate.

Leiren-Young has frequently written for and about young audiences. His Theatre for Young Audiences scripts include &quot;Basically Good Kids&quot; (about teens caught up in a riot) and &quot;Jim&quot; (a solo show about a teen runaway obsessed with The Doors frontman Jim Morrison).

===Memoirs===
Twenty years after his stint at &quot;The Williams Lake Tribune&quot;, Leiren-Young turned his experiences into a comic memoir, &quot;Never Shoot A Stampede Queen&quot; (Heritage House, 2009), which won the 2009 Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour. Leiren-Young adapted the memoir for stage, where it received its world premiere with the Western Canada Theatre company in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada in 2013. A second production debuted at Vancouver&#x27;s Granville Island Stage in May, 2013. The book was adapted for the stage by Leiren-Young and directed and dramaturged by TJ Dawe.
His latest memoir, &quot;Free Magic Secrets Revealed&quot; (Harbour Publishing, 2013), tells the story of his high school misadventures staging a disastrous magic show. 
Leiren-Young is currently adapting both memoirs for film.

Leiren-Young is a passionate environmentalist. He hosts the Skaana podcast where he interviews experts like Paul Watson, David Suzuki and Elizabeth May about orcas, oceans and the environment. He has written and spoken about how Canada&#x27;s Trans Mountain Pipeline could lead to the extinction of the endangered Southern resident killer whales.
He hosted a podcast for Vancouver&#x27;s independent online news site &quot;The Tyee&quot;, where he often addressed issues facing British Columbia&#x27;s old growth forests. His Tyee interviews provided the content for his book, &quot;The Green Chain: Nothing Is Ever Clear Cut&quot; (Heritage House, 2009), which examines the logging industry. Described by the National Post as &quot;Canada&#x27;s go to guy for dolphins, whales and trees&quot;, Leiren-Young has also been dubbed &quot;Canada&#x27;s greenest writer&quot;.

===Moby Doll===
In October 2014, Leiren-Young wrote the article &quot;Moby Doll&quot; for &quot;The Walrus&quot;. The Walrus feature tells the story of the first killer whale displayed in captivity, Moby Doll, who was harpooned in the summer of 1964 off the coast of British Columbia&#x27;s Saturna Island. Moby Doll survived just eighty-seven days in a waterfront pen but, during that time, changed the world&#x27;s attitude towards orcas. The Walrus article was a finalist for the 2015 National Magazine Awards. 
Leiren-Young wrote &quot;Moby Doll: The Whale that Changed the World&quot;, which aired as a radio broadcast November 7, 2014 on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Ideas&quot; with Paul Kennedy. The documentary won the 2014 Jack Webster Award for Best Feature Story in radio for the broadcast. 
In 2016, the book &quot;The Killer Whale Who Changed the World&quot; was published. It spent four weeks on the Maclean&#x27;s bestseller list and was long-listed for the 2017 RBC Taylor Prize, and short-listed for the Hubert Evans Prize. It was the winner of the Science Writers and Communicators of Canada award for the best &quot;general interest&quot; book.

A feature-length film documentary of &quot;The Killer Whale Who Changed the World&quot; is currently in post-production (2020). The movie is set to be distributed by Kinosmith (the Canadian distributors of &quot;Blackfish&quot;).

===Awards===
Leiren-Young won the 2017 Writers Guild of Canada Award for Best Documentary for his movie, &quot;The Hundred-Year-Old Whale.&quot; He has received three other Writers Guild of Canada nominations for his work in radio and film. He received the 2017 Bron Iris Award in 2017 for his &quot;commitment to the promotion of female creators&quot; in film and television. 
He won the 2009 Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour for his comic memoir, &quot;Never Shoot a Stampede Queen.&quot; Leiren-Young was the 1993 recipient of a National Magazine award for his &quot;Theatrum&quot; column and has received two Western Magazine Awards, the latest presented in 2013.

<doc id="285382" wikidata="Q863812" url="?curid=285382" title="Lamborghini Countach">
<text>The Lamborghini Countach ( ) is a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini from 1974 until 1990. It is one of the many exotic designs developed by Italian design house Bertone, which pioneered and popularized the sharply angled &quot;Italian Wedge&quot; shape.

The style was introduced to the public in 1970 as the Lancia Stratos Zero concept car. The first showing of the Countach prototype was at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show, as the Lamborghini LP500 concept.

The &quot;Countach&quot; nameplate was reused for the Sián-based limited-production hybrid-electric model called the Countach LPI 800-4 in 2021.

==Design and development==
The development of the Countach was initiated by Ferruccio Lamborghini with the goal of creating a successor to the Miura. The Miura was widely acclaimed after its introduction in 1966, but by 1970 new competitors including the Ferrari Daytona had been introduced to the market, and the Miura was showing its age. Chief engineer Paolo Stanzani and his staff began work on the Miura successor in 1970 under the project name &quot;LP112.&quot; From the beginning of the project, Stanzani&#x27;s collaborators included test driver Bob Wallace, assistant engineer Massimo Parenti and designer Marcello Gandini of Bertone.

Stanzani and Ferruccio Lamborghini agreed that the Miura&#x27;s successor required a mechanical design that enabled the greatest possible performance as well as a body that was both aerodynamically efficient and aesthetically daring. These principles had formed the Miura&#x27;s development and enabled the commercial success of that model. Despite Mr. Lamborghini&#x27;s preference for comfortable grand tourers, he recognized the commercial value of a more uncompromising sports car like the Miura and gave Stanzani&#x27;s team permission to further push boundaries with the LP112 project. The resulting Countach incorporated successful aspects of the Miura, such as the rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive layout along with many new engineering and styling innovations. Lamborghini&#x27;s engineering team addressed several flaws in the Miura design, improving high-speed stability and reducing lift-off oversteer as well as addressing the limited maintenance access, uneven weight distribution and cooling issues endemic to the Miura&#x27;s transverse engine layout.

After a year of intensive development work, the first Countach prototype, designated LP500, was shown to the public at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show. Subsequently, the Lamborghini engineering team spent three years refining this radical prototype into the production-ready LP400 Countach, which debuted in 1974.

===Name===
The Countach name originated in late 1970 or 1971, near the beginning of the LP112 project. Most previous and subsequent Lamborghini car names are associated with famous bulls and bullfighting, but the Countach broke with this tradition. The name originated from the word (), an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese language.

Marcello Gandini, the designer of the Countach, explained the origin of the name:

Lamborghini used a system of alphanumeric designations in order to further delineate Countach models. This designation begins with &quot;LP&quot;, an abbreviation of the Italian , meaning &quot;longitudinal rear&quot;. This refers to the engine orientation and placement shared by all Countach models. For the prototype and early production models, &quot;LP&quot; was followed by a three digit number designating nominal engine displacement, &quot;400&quot; for 3.9-litre engines and &quot;500&quot; for 4.8 and 5-litre engines. Therefore, the full name of the first production Countach was the Lamborghini Countach LP400. As in the Miura, the letter &quot;S&quot; (short for Sport) was added for later high performance variants. This naming scheme was disrupted by the 1985 LP5000 Quattrovalvole equipped with a 5.2-litre engine, also called the 5000QV. The LP- designation was dropped entirely for the 1988 25th Anniversary Edition, also called the Anniversary.

===Styling===
The Countach was styled by Marcello Gandini of the Bertone design studio. His design for the Countach&#x27;s predecessor, the Miura, achieved commercial success and critical acclaim from the automotive press when it was introduced in March 1966. Following the Miura&#x27;s debut, Gandini began experimenting with a new, more angular and geometric design language in a series of concept cars for Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo and Lancia. In particular, the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo and 1970 Lancia Stratos Zero were direct styling precursors to the Countach. Like the Countach, they were both entirely wedge-shaped, mid-engine designs with a low, flat front, truncated tail and angular details. Both of these concept cars featured unconventional methods of entry into the passenger compartment—a hinged windshield for the Stratos Zero and scissor doors for the Carabo—foreshadowing the scissor doors used on the Countach.

At the start of the LP112 project in 1970, Lamborghini commissioned Gandini and his team at Bertone to develop a body for the then-unnamed prototype. Chief engineer Paolo Stanzani supplied the design team with chassis information so that body design could proceed while the mechanical details of the prototype were finalised. Shortly before the 1971 Geneva Auto Show, the finished chassis was shipped to Bertone, where the prototype bodywork and interior were installed. The resulting Countach LP500 prototype was unveiled at the 1971 Geneva Auto show, where its unconventional design drew great public interest and extensive press coverage. The LP500 prototype had a crisp, wedge-shaped design that, compared to the Miura, was wide and very low but shorter in overall length. Overall dimensions of the prototype were wide, tall, and long. The nose of the prototype tapered sharply to a thin grille, an uninterrupted slope enabled by headlights in retractable housings that flipped down inside the body when not in use. The prototype&#x27;s body lacked bumpers, aerodynamic spoilers, side mirrors and any other addition that would have interrupted the lines of Gandini&#x27;s design. Trapezoidal shapes appeared throughout the body, including in the windshield, side windows, door openings, hood and engine covers and taillights. Air was supplied to the engine and side-mounted radiators through louvered vents immediately behind the side windows, although road testing quickly demonstrated these vents alone were inadequate to control engine temperatures.

The interior of the prototype was equally notable to contemporary audiences as the exterior, as it incorporated new technologies and bold styling decisions. Gandini initially sketched a dashboard with all-digital readouts for the Countach. This dashboard design was not fully realised in time for the debut, the LP500 prototype instead used a conventional analog speedometer and tachometer. However, the LP500 dashboard incorporated other innovations from Gandini&#x27;s original sketches, including aircraft or spaceship-inspired warning lights placed centrally on the steering column, within the arc of the steering wheel. One of these warning lights served a similar purpose as a modern automatic cruise control system, illuminating when a set speed was exceeded. Another innovation was the inclusion of an on-board diagnostic system (long before their standardization and widespread adoption) that displayed the status of the car&#x27;s individual subsystems superimposed on a schematic view of the entire car, located on the dashboard to the driver&#x27;s left. Due to the poor rearward visibility inherent in the Countach design, a periscope was integrated into the passenger compartment roof, instead of a conventional rear-view mirror. This periscope system was obtained from Donnelly Mirrors, who had first developed it for an ESV project. Gandini also used a single-spoke steering wheel and deeply recessed bucket seats, which shared a stylised motif of segmented blocks. The low seating position, prominent transmission tunnel and wide door sills all contributed to the sensation of being inside a race car cockpit.

The scissor doors of the Countach prototype were a prominent design feature carried over to the production Countach as well as many subsequent Lamborghini models. First appearing on Gandini&#x27;s 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept car, they attached to the vehicle structure at the front of the door using horizontal hinges, so that they lifted up and tilted forward when opened. The mechanism was assisted by gas struts, which supported the weight of the doors and smoothed the opening and closing motion. Gandini incorporated this door design as both a styling gesture and to facilitate entry. The car&#x27;s wide chassis and high and wide doorsills made entry using conventional doors difficult in narrow spaces. Conversely, care needed to be taken in opening the scissor doors under low ceilings. Due to poor rearward visibility and the wide sills, many Countach drivers park by opening the door, sitting on the sill, and reversing into the parking spot while looking over the back of the car from outside. The scissor doors made it difficult to exit the car following a rollover accident. Lamborghini engineers studied solutions to this problem including an easily removable &quot;kick-out&quot; windscreen or using explosive bolts to remove the doors following an accident, although neither were incorporated into the production Countach.

Following the LP500 prototype&#x27;s public debut, the body design was progressively altered during pre-production testing to improve aerodynamic performance, high speed stability, engine cooling and ability to meet mandated safety requirements. This resulted in many differences between the LP500 prototype and the production LP400. The most visible change was the addition of several vents to improve engine cooling and air intake. These included NACA ducts spanning the doors and rear wings on each side and protruding air intake boxes, which replaced the louvered vents behind the side windows. The slope of the nose was made shallower to reduce excessive front-end downforce that destabilized the prototype during braking. The side windows inset with small trapezoidal glass sections were changed to horizontally split two-piece windows with a retractable lower half. Additional small windows were added behind the side windows, slightly improving rearward visibility. The futuristic dashboard and diagnostic displays seen on the prototype were replaced with a conventionally styled dashboard using Stewart-Warner analog gauges, while the single-spoke steering wheel was replaced with a three spoke wheel similar to those used on other production Lamborghinis. The periscope rear-view mirror was retained for the LP400, but for subsequent Countach models it was replaced with conventional rear view mirrors. The overall dimensions of the LP400 were slightly larger than the prototype, at wide, tall, and long.

The styling of the Countach was continually altered as new production models were introduced. Later additions—including flared arches, spoilers, carburetor covers and bumpers—progressively changed the Countach body in order to improve the model&#x27;s performance, safety and appearance. Despite these updates, the basic shape of the first Countach prototype revealed in 1971 remained virtually unchanged over its 19-year lifespan.

===Engine and transmission===
The Countach was designed around the existing Lamborghini V12 engine in a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. In contrast to the Miura&#x27;s transversely mounted engine, the engine in the Countach was longitudinally mounted. This layout was a first for a road-going V12, previously used only in the Ferrari P-series racing cars. However, chief engineer Paolo Stanzani wanted to improve the weight distribution of the car even further and devised a new type of longitudinal layout that would avoid placing the mass of the transmission at the rear of the car. The resulting configuration had the output shaft at the front of the engine, immediately connecting through the clutch assembly to the transmission. The transmission itself was a 5-speed manual with Porsche-type synchromesh and was mounted in the middle of the car between the two seats. The driveshaft ran from the transmission through the engine&#x27;s oil sump to a differential at the rear. This arrangement effectively sandwiched the length of the engine between the mid-mounted transmission and the rear-mounted differential. This configuration had numerous advantages over the Miura&#x27;s transverse engine, including an increase in stability from placing more mass near the car&#x27;s center, a shorter overall wheelbase, a more direct gear-shift linkage for easier and faster shifting, better cooling and easier maintenance access to engine components.

The Lamborghini V12 used in the Countach originated in 1963 and was designed by Giotto Bizzarrini. Versions of this engine were used in preceding and then currently produced Lamborghini models including the 350 GT, 400 GT, Islero, Espada and Miura. As used in the Miura, this engine had a displacement, a 60º cylinder bank angle, double overhead camshafts per bank, two valves per cylinder, lubrication and distributor ignition. Paolo Stanzani&#x27;s engineering team wished to increase the Countach engine&#x27;s power over the maximum of as seen on the Miura SV. The 3.9-litre version had been tuned to be rated approximately between in the experimental P400 Jota, but an engine of this specification was expensive to manufacture and was difficult to handle in normal city driving due to lack of low-RPM power. Therefore, the engineers decided to increase the engine&#x27;s displacement to 5-litre, in order to extract more power while avoiding the usability problems of a race-tuned engine. This increase in displacement would require a major redesign of the existing V12. Lamborghini&#x27;s plan was to produce the 5-litre engine in time for series production and published specification sheets for the proposed production 5-litre engine at the 1971 debut of the prototype. Lamborghini reported this engine would be rated at at 7,400 rpm. One experimental engine was constructed by boring out a conventional 3.9-litre engine block and was fitted to the Countach LP500 prototype for testing purposes. It incorporated many lightweight castings made from Elektron, an expensive magnesium alloy. This engine self-destructed during a 1971 road test by Bob Wallace. This made it clear that further revisions to the basic engine design were required to improve durability. The LP500 prototype was subsequently fitted with a 3.9-litre engine for the remainder of pre-production testing.

The first production cars used a 3.9-litre engine as durability issues with the new 5-litre engine could not be resolved in time. As equipped to the 1974 Countach LP400, the engine was rated at at 8,000 rpm. The stated power output was less than that of the Miura SV, which was blamed on the use of side-draft Weber 45 DCOE carburetors instead of the down-draft carburetors used on the Miura. Later engine development eventually increased the engine displacement to in the 1982 LP500S, and then to with four valves per cylinder in the 1985 LP5000 Quattrovalvole. All variants of the Countach were equipped with six Weber carburetors until the arrival of the LP5000 QV model, some of which used Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection to meet US emissions regulations. European-specification cars continued to use carburetors until the arrival of the succeeding Diablo.
===Chassis and body construction===
Paolo Stanzani and the Lamborghini engineering team developed an all-steel partial space frame chassis for the LP500 Countach prototype. This prototype chassis was constructed of both a steel sheet and square-section steel tubing, with wall thicknesses between . The front section primarily used stamped and spot-welded sheet steel, with certain areas stiffened by stamped ribs and welded reinforcement panels. Stiffening frames constructed of sheet steel and tubing extended through the center of the car, along both door sills and around the central transmission tunnel. The rear section of the chassis consisted of almost entirely square-section tubing and included diagonal bracing and multiple cross-members for strength. This prototype chassis was constructed by Marchesi of Modena, which had produced chassis for earlier Lamborghini models.

The prototype chassis was stiffer and heavier than the Miura chassis. It weighed , while the Miura&#x27;s chassis weighed . The additional weight was partially due to the lack of the lightening holes used in the Miura and partially due to the need to construct an extra-durable chassis for pre-production testing. In addition to the strength and stiffness improvements over the Miura design, engineers believed that greater use of steel tubing would result in a chassis that was easier for the factory to fabricate and easier to protect from corrosion.

Following testing of the LP500 prototype during 1971, Stanzani and his team decided to further revise the chassis design. The dimensions and layout were similar, but the steel sheet and square tube construction used in the prototype was entirely disregarded in favor of a full space frame constructed of welded round-section steel tubing. Compared to the prototype, this design used a much more complex welded assembly of cross-braced tubular frames and was reinforced with sheet metal gussets in a few key areas. Tubes of , , and diameter were used, all with wall thickness. Overall, this new design was stiffer and weighed less, at . At the time, this construction technique was used in Formula One but was extremely advanced for a road-going automobile. In addition to the performance benefits of this design, engineers recognized that building a technologically advanced and visually complex chassis would align with Lamborghini&#x27;s marketing strategy and sell better than a conventional design. The full space frame chassis was tested in a second Countach prototype and would be used basically unchanged on subsequent production cars. Chassis fabrication added a significant amount to the cost of the car as each chassis required laborious hand-welding, first by Marchesi then again during final assembly at the Lamborghini factory. However, logistically this method of fabrication was relatively easy to incorporate into the low-volume, manually skilled production line.

Prototype and production Countach bodies were constructed primarily of unstressed aluminum panels. Stanzani had initially considered fabricating body panels from the lightweight alloy Avional, primarily used in aircraft construction, but found it expensive and difficult to obtain. A more conventional aluminum alloy was used instead. Prototypes used aluminum panels between 1–1.2 mm thick, increased to for the production LP400. The aluminum body panels were fabricated by Bertone. These panels were supported by thin steel frames welded to the main chassis. Once the panels were in place, factory workers would then hand-form them in order to adjust the final body shape, surface smoothness and gaps between panels. As the spaceframe chassis did not have an integrated floor panel, a separate fiberglass and aluminum panel was installed underneath the passenger compartment. Although the LP400 used an all-aluminum body, later versions of the Countach would incorporate body components made of fiberglass and carbon composites.

===Prototypes===
Lamborghini created three pre-production Countach prototypes prior to the introduction of the LP400 production model.

The first prototype was the LP500, which was displayed at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show and later used for pre-production testing and development by the factory. This car had many mechanical and styling differences compared to the production LP400. It was built on a partial spaceframe steel chassis which was heavier and simpler compared to the production version&#x27;s full tubular spaceframe. The bright yellow bodywork closely followed Gandini&#x27;s original design for the car but was modified during testing with additional air inlets to improve engine cooling. The 5.0 liter V12 engine initially fitted to the LP500 was destroyed during testing and replaced with a 3.9 liter V12, similar to the engine used on the production LP400. The LP500 prototype was destroyed in a crash test on March 21, 1974 at the MIRA facility in England to gain European type approval, even though its construction method was utterly unlike production vehicles. In 2017, a recreation of the LP500 prototype was constructed by Lamborghini Polo Storico, the Lamborghini factory&#x27;s restoration division. The completed recreation was first displayed to the public at the 2021 Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este.

The second Countach prototype (chassis number 1120001) was shown to the public at the 1973 Geneva Motor Show (painted red) and at the 1973 Paris Motor Show (painted green). The bodywork of this car was much closer to that of the LP400 production model, and now incorporated the side NACA ducts and air intake boxes tested on the first prototype. This car showed some styling details from the first prototype that would not carry over into production, including trapezoidal windows and a bumperless nose with silver, recessed grill. This was the first car to be equipped with the tubular full spaceframe chassis used on production models. This car was fitted with the 3.9-litre engine, although contemporary press releases still designated it as an &quot;LP500&quot;, possibly because Lamborghini engineers still intended to use a 5.0-litre engine in the production version. In addition to appearing at motor shows, Lamborghini engineers used the second prototype for road testing and as a reference to create the wooden master pattern for all body panels. This car currently resides in the Lamborghini factory museum.

The third Countach prototype (chassis number 1120002) was shown at the 1974 Geneva Motor Show and was the first to be constructed entirely in the Lamborghini factory, except for the chassis built by Marchesi. It is sometimes called the first pre-production or first production LP400 Countach. This car was painted bright yellow and had the finalized production LP400 body style, which was longer than the previous prototype bodies to increase interior space. The trapezoidal side windows seen in the first prototypes were replaced with a three-panel design, which was easier to manufacture. The wheel arch shape was slightly changed to prevent the rear tyres from rubbing when the suspension was compressed. To improve long-term durability, the thickness of the body sheet metal was increased from 1.2 mm to 1.5 mm and the suspension and gearbox mounting points were made from tubing with a greater wall thickness. The interior was changed to final production form, losing Gandini&#x27;s electronic diagnostic displays from the first prototype and using instead conventional gauges manufactured by Stewart-Warner.

==Production history==

===LP400===


The first production model of the Countach was the LP400, produced from 1974 until 1978. It was first offered for sale at the 1974 Geneva Auto Show, where 50 orders were placed. The LP400 was equipped with a engine delivering . This engine was given the type designation &quot;L 406.&quot;

Externally, little had changed from the second prototype. The nose panel was altered, the side windows now split horizontally, and various details of interior trim were changed. The LP400 was equipped with Michelin XWX tires, sized front 205/70R14 and rear 215/70R14. The narrow tires and the slick styling meant that this version had the lowest drag coefficient of any Countach model. The emblems at the rear simply read &quot;Lamborghini&quot; and &quot;Countach&quot;, with no engine displacement or valve arrangement markings as is found on later variants.

The LP400 chassis was constructed by Marchesi, then delivered to the Lamborghini factory at Sant&#x27;Agata where the car was assembled and painted. The engine and transmission were also manufactured at Sant&#x27;Agata. Each engine was run for a total of 5 hours and inspected before being installed in the car. The LP400 production line was developed and supervised by Giancarlo Guerra, a former Scaglietti employee who worked closely with Stanzani. By the end of production in 1978, the company had produced 157 Countach LP400s.

===LP400 S===
In 1978, a new LP400 S model was introduced. Though the engine was slightly downgraded from the LP400 model at , the most radical changes were on the exterior, where , and fiberglass wheel arch extensions were added, giving the car the fundamental look it kept until the end of its production run. An optional V-shaped rear wing was available over the rear deck following the popularity generated from the rear wing of the Walter Wolf Countach, which, while improving high-speed stability, reduced the top speed by at least . Most owners ordered the car with the wing despite this disadvantage. The LP400 S&#x27; handling was improved by the wider tyres, which made the car more stable while cornering. The standard emblems (&quot;Lamborghini&quot; and &quot;Countach&quot;) were kept at the rear, but an angular &quot;S&quot; emblem was added after the &quot;Countach&quot; on the right side.

There are three distinct Countach LP400 S Series:
* Series One: 50 were produced. The final chassis number of this series was 1121100. Series I cars can be identified by distinctive Campagnolo &quot;Bravo&quot; wheels with protruding hole edges, carburetors and a lowered suspension ride height. Early series one cars used small Stewart-Warner dashboard gauges, which were changed to larger versions halfway through 1979. The very early 1978 cars had the original, unpadded LP400 steering wheel, while later cars used a different, padded style.
* Series Two: 105 were produced. The final chassis number of this series was 1121310. Series II cars can be identified by their smooth, concave wheels and lowered (&quot;lowbody&quot;) suspension ride height.
* Series Three: 82 were produced. The first chassis number of this series was 1121312 and the final chassis number was 1121468. Series III cars can be identified by their increased suspension ride height compared to series I and II cars. The usable interior space was also increased by .
===LP500 S===
1982 saw another update to the Countach, with a larger displacement, more powerful engine. The bodywork was unaltered, however, the interior was given an update. This variant is sometimes called the 5000 S in some markets, which may cause confusion with the later 5000 QV. 321 cars were built.

===LP5000 Quattrovalvole===

In 1985, the engine design evolved again, as it was bored and stroked to and given 4 valves per cylinder—&quot;quattro valvole&quot; in Italian, hence the model&#x27;s name, Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole or 5000 QV in short. The carburetors were moved from the sides to the top of the engine for better cooling—unfortunately this created a hump on the engine cover, reducing the already poor rear visibility to almost zero. Some body panels were also replaced by Kevlar. In later versions of the engine, the carburetors were replaced with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system. The Fuel injected engine was rated at . The European carbureted (also known as &quot;Downdraft&quot; or &quot;DD&quot;) versions used six Weber carburetors and were rated at at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 5,200 rpm. 610 cars were built in this specification, with 66 having the fuel injection system.

On the 26th of June 2024, a Lego set of the car was made.

===25th Anniversary Edition===
Named to honour the company&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary in 1988, the 25th Anniversary Countach, although mechanically very similar to the 5000QV, sported considerable restyling done by Horacio Pagani. Notably, enlargement and extension of the rear &#x27;air-box&#x27; intake-ducts was among other refinements undertaken (extending them to a more gradual incline further in-keeping with aerodynamic-streamlining), while the secondary pair of debossed ducts, originally situated further behind them, were brought forward and relocated directly on top, encompassing refashioned fins now running longitudinally rather than transversely. This allowed the airboxes, before located behind the radiators, to be rotated from a transverse to a longitudinal position, allowing better airflow from the radiators out through the secondary fins. Additionally, further reconstruction of an already modified engine-bay cover, from a concept consisting of dual-raised sections and tri-ducting, to one that embodies a centre-raised section incorporating dual-ducting become another feature. Various redevelopments to the rear were made; most notably the introduction of a rear bumper extending outwardly from the lower-portion.

These styling changes, particularly features such as the fin strakes within the primary rear-intake-ducts openings, appeared to mimic the Ferrari Testarossa, though providing crucial improved engine cooling. Nonetheless it was only outsold by the QV model. It continued to feature 345/35R15 tyres. The Anniversary edition was produced up until 1990 before being superseded by the Lamborghini Diablo.

The 25th Anniversary Edition was the most refined and possibly the fastest variant of the Lamborghini Countach, accelerating from in 4.7 seconds and achieving a top speed of .

== North America ==
The United States is Lamborghini&#x27;s biggest market and has traditionally been the largest market in the world for expensive cars such as exotic sports cars. However neither the Countach, nor its closest competitor, the Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer, were built from the factory to meet United States or Canadian safety and emissions regulations.

Americans purchased the Countach anyway, and individual consumers paid to modify each vehicle to meet United States Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of Transportation regulations. This was known as the &quot;grey market era (1976-1988)&quot;. While the Countach, Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer, and Range Rover were among the first such vehicles, the infrastructure they created allowed the &quot;grey market&quot; to reach 66,900 vehicles in 1985.

In 1985, with the introduction of the 5000 QV, a U.S. specification model was produced by the factory, meeting United States federal safety and emissions regulations. Changes to the American specification models included larger energy-absorbing bumpers, as the original bumper design did not meet the American &quot;5 mile per hour&quot; regulation (1974–1981), and a Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system. Many owners removed the bumpers immediately or received their new cars without bumpers installed.

American federal law exempts all vehicles older than 25 years from all design, safety, and emission regulations. Therefore, any original Countach can be freely imported into the US and registered for unrestricted road use in states that permit such activity.

==Special versions==

===Walter Wolf Countach===

In 1975, Walter Wolf, a wealthy Canadian businessman and owner of the Wolf F1 Racing team in the 1970s, purchased an LP400; however, he was not satisfied with the LP400&#x27;s engine and asked Giampaolo Dallara to create a special high-power version of the Countach. Dallara was the former chief engineer at Lamborghini and had founded his own company, Dallara Automobili, in 1972. Dallara modified chassis 1120148 to create the &quot;Walter Wolf Special&quot; with an engine identical to the engine from the original 1971 LP500 prototype, which generated at 7,900 rpm and enabled the car to attain a theoretical maximum speed of . This model also featured upgraded wheels, Pirelli P7 tyres, flared arches, and front and rear spoilers, all features that would become integrated on future Countach&#x27;s starting with the LP400 S. Wolf&#x27;s car was painted red with black flared arches, was designated &quot;LP500 S&quot; like the standard Countach model from the 1980s, and was the key stepping stone that led to the development of these later production models.

Two subsequent Wolf Specials were produced, the first, painted Bugatti blue, No. 1120202 was kept by the factory, and the last, a darker navy blue, No. 1121210 was the very first LP400 S and presented at the 1978 Geneva Motor Show. Both of the later Wolf cars used the original 5.0-litre engine commissioned by Wolf, transplanted to each car in turn.

===Countach Turbo S===
During the early 1980s, two modified turbocharged Countachs were commissioned by Max Bobnar, the official Lamborghini distributor in Switzerland. Bobnar hired Master Technician Franz Albert to convert the cars to a twin-turbo configuration and to make other performance modifications unique to the two prototypes; this was accomplished between 1980 and 1982. One was based on an LP500 S and was painted black, while the other was based on a Series I LP400 S and painted metallic red. The LP500 S Turbo was presented to the public at the 1984 Geneva Motor Show.

The LP500 S twin turbo weighed , while its 4.8 litre twin-turbocharged V12 engine had a claimed maximum power output of and of torque, enabling the car to accelerate from in 3.7 seconds and attain a top speed of . A manual boost controller, located beneath the steering wheel, could be used to adjust the boost pressure from 0.7 bar to 1.5 bar at which the engine generated its maximum power output. The Turbo S has 15&quot; wheels with 255/45 tyres on the front and 345/35 on the rear.

===Countach QVX===
The Countach QVX was a short-lived Group C sports racing car built in 1985. It was not built or designed by the Lamborghini factory, but instead used a Spice Engineering and CC engineering built chassis and an engine derived from the Lamborghini Countach&#x27;s V12 having a displacement of 5.7-litres. This engine was reported to generate a maximum power output between depending on track conditions and utilised a Hewland VG-C racing transmission. The engine was built under the direction of Luigi Marmiroli and used data derived from Lamborghini&#x27;s marine engines. Lamborghini&#x27;s British importer David Jolliffe commissioned the car. The car was entered in the 1985 season of LeMans but didn&#x27;t have any success despite keeping up with the winning Jaguar. It was entered again in the 1986 season by its sponsor, Unipart, but the funding soon ran out and the car was pulled out of competition.

===F1 safety car===
Between 1980 and 1983, Formula One employed the Countach as its safety car during the Monaco Grand Prix.

===Countach Evoluzione===
The Countach Evoluzione was a one-off prototype and testbed car built by Lamborghini in 1987. It was developed by Lamborghini&#x27;s engineering team in order to test multiple technologies for the Countach&#x27;s successor. The Evoluzione used a substantially different chassis and body than the production Countach and lacked interior trim, soundproofing and air-conditioning. It was continually modified for testing purposes and all body panels were left unpainted. Although there was no production version of the Evoluzione, the Countach Anniversary Edition and the Diablo would incorporate some of its engineering, including carbon fibre/Kevlar composite body panels.

The Evoluzione was built on an all-new chassis but used engine, suspension and wheels from the Countach LP5000QV production model, although all these components would be modified during testing. While based on the production engine, the Evoluzione engine was blueprinted for greater performance and generated approximately . The transmission was modified with a short throw shifter but was otherwise the same as the production version. The Evoluzione accelerated from in approximately 4 seconds and had a reported top speed around .

The most radical change from the production Countach was a new chassis and body incorporating many composite materials, including Kevlar and carbon fibre-reinforced plastics and aluminum honeycomb panels. The tubular steel space frame chassis of the production Countach was completely replaced with a new composite unibody structure. The front boot lid, rear engine cover, front air dam and wheel arches were made of carbon/Kevlar composite, while the wings and doors used more conventional but still lightweight aluminum panels. Aerodynamic wheel covers made from composite materials were also tested but were found to increase heat build-up and brake fade. These changes resulted in a radical weight reduction of approximately compared to the contemporary LP5000QV production model. The new body also reduced the drag coefficient by approximately 10%. The 1988 Countach Anniversary edition incorporated features of the Evoluzione body, including several composite panels and air intakes integrated into the lower door sills.

Lamborghini engineers used the Evoluzione as a testbed for many other technologies during its existence. These included a 4WD drivetrain, electronically controlled ride height, active suspension, ABS, and retractable, low-drag windscreen wipers.

Although contemporary publications mention the possibility of a limited production run based on the Evoluzione, the car never entered production. The single Countach Evoluzione prototype was destroyed by the Lamborghini factory during crash testing and no longer exists.

=== Countach L150 ===

The Countach L150 was a one-off prototype developed between 1984 and 1987 under the supervision of engineer Giulio Alfieri. The L150 was intended to represent a new Countach-based production model. It was developed into a fully functional prototype at the request of Lamborghini owner and CEO Patrick Mimran. Mimran was presented with two approaches for future Lamborghini models in the mid 1980s: Alfieri wished to continue developing the Countach, while newly hired engineer Luigi Marmiroli began designing a new model which would become the Diablo. The L150 represented Alfieri&#x27;s approach, and included many body panels intended to improve engine cooling and update the car&#x27;s styling. Efforts were also taken to improve the car&#x27;s comfort, such as installing electric windows. Mimran eventually rejected the L150 due to cost concerns, instead choosing a less ambitious update of the Countach with the 25th Anniversary Edition while also approving further development of Marmiroli&#x27;s Diablo concept. In 1987, Mimran acquired the L150 for his personal collection. In 1989, it was sold to Lamborghini collector Minoru Miura and still remains in his collection as of 2021.

==Production figures==
A total of 1,983 cars were built during the Countach&#x27;s sixteen-year lifetime:

Substantially more than half were built in the final five years of production, as Lamborghini&#x27;s new corporate owners increased production.

A small number of new Countachs were assembled in Cape Town, South Africa during the mid-1970s by local dealer and importer Intermotormakers (IMM). IMM imported Countachs and other Lamborghini models from the Lamborghini factory as complete knock-down kits. This import arrangement was active until the South African government revoked IMM&#x27;s exemption to phase V of the local content programme, which took effect in 1980 and mandated that cars manufactured in South Africa incorporate a minimum of 66% locally produced content. The total number of Intermotormakers-assembled Countachs is unknown, but they constitute a very small fraction of Countach production.

== Countach LPI 800-4 ==


In order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Countach in 2021, the nameplate is reused on a limited-production hybrid-electric model called the Countach LPI 800-4 which has a naturally aspirated 6.5-litre V12 engine with a 48-volt electric motor based on the technology of the Sián FKP 37.

Lent&#x27;s fiction and poetry have appeared for years in magazines across Canada, including: &quot;The Malahat Review&quot;, &quot;Event&quot;, &quot;Dandelion&quot;, &quot;Grain&quot;, &quot;The Wascana Review&quot;, &quot;NeWest Review&quot;, &quot;Prairie Fire&quot;, &quot;CV2&quot;, &quot;New Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Waves&quot;, &quot;Matrix&quot;, &quot;The Fiddlehead&quot;, and &quot;The Antigonish Review&quot;. Lent has read from his work in many cities in Canada, and internationally. Lent has also published critical articles on the work of Malcolm Lowry, Thomas DeQuincey, Wyndham Lewis, Tom Wayman, Kristjana Gunnars, Mavis Gallant, Dennis Brutus and Wilfred Watson.

&quot;My continuing interest,&quot; Lent says, &quot;is the relationship between consciousness and notions of &#x27;narrative&#x27; in both fiction and poetry. So I&#x27;m fascinated by what happens when you take a person in a very ordinary, textured world and the story that surfaces actually mimics the process of awareness that is right at the heart of that world...so it&#x27;s this wonderful, crazy mix of subjectivity and things that keeps drawing me to more open, more flexible forms of story. I find that whole process nervy and exciting.&quot;

Lent is also a singer-songwriter and plays in a roots/jazz trio, The Lent/Fraser/Wall Trio, which performs in British Columbia, and has opened for groups as various as Leahey, Chilliwack, Campbell Ryga, Long John Baldry, UHF and others. John Lent lives with his wife, Jude Clarke (painter and writer) in Vernon, British Columbia. Lent is a member of the Writers Union of Canada, SOCAN, the Canadian Songwriters Association, and the Associated Writing Programs (USA).

==Biography==
John Lent was born on July 8, 1948, in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He is the son of Harry and Adrienne (Brown) Lent and is one of seven siblings (Susan, Michael, Harry, Francis, Timothy, Mary-Lou). Lent married the painter Jude Clarke in 1981. Educated at the University of Alberta, B.A. (with honors), 1969, M.A., 1971, where he was a student of Sheila Watson, Lent pursued doctoral studies at York University, 1971–75, including field work in British Columbia, on Malcolm Lowry and Spatial Form.

Prior to joining Okanagan College, Lent taught at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, and Notre Dame University College in Nelson, British Columbia. Starting in 1979, he taught creative writing and literature courses at Okanagan College in Vernon, British Columbia. He retired from the position of Dean, North Okanagan Region, Okanagan College, in April 2011. He was influential in the creation of the Ryga Award for Social Responsibility in Canadian Literature, &quot;Ryga a Journal of Provocations&quot;, the Mackie Lecture and Reading Series, the Kalamalka Press, &quot;KIdsWWwrite&quot; (a creative writing ezine) and the KIWW Digital Archives, as well as several radio programs and newsprint collaborations such as &quot;The Kalamalka Chronicles&quot;. John Lent&#x27;s participation in and authoring of the opening chapter of the, initially, serialised &quot;Kalamalka Chronicles&quot;, a community writing project initiated by &quot;The Sun Review&quot; newspaper and the Kalamalka Institute for Working Writers, emphasises the degree to which he experiments with narrative form and authorship. In this instance, the characters and their opening maneuvers were controlled by Lent, then re-authored and re-plotted by eight other writers. That the &#x27;contest&#x27; was quite lively and that the newspaper folded after the publication of chapter nine is, perhaps, indicative of a community of writers rather than readers. In addition to these services to the literary arts and promotion of quality writing, Lent has engendered careers in writing through his work as a teacher and as an editor. He was a writer in residence at Sage Hill, Saskatchewan from 2009 to 2011. Lent reads his work in many cities in Canada, the United States, France, and England. He is a founding member of the Kalamalka Press, the Kalamalka Institute for working writers, and the annual Mackie Lecture and Reading series at Okanagan College. Lent is also a singer-songwriter and played in the roots/jazz trio Lent Fraser Wall.

Lent lives in Vernon, British Columbia, where he has finished revising a novel, &quot;The Path to Ardroe&quot;, a multi-voiced narrative set in Vernon, Strasbourg and the Scottish highlands, scheduled for publication in Spring 2012. He is also at work on a sequence of essays on consciousness and form, covering, among others, the writings of DeQuincey, Gunnars and Lowry.

==Critical response==
John Lent is an academic, essayist, poet, short story writer and musician. His work is marked by a mixing of genres that aims to produce a literary equivalent of jazz music. Lent also draws on art (especially the Impressionists) and has been influenced by the pioneering work of Joseph Frank in spatial form.

&quot;A Rock Solid&quot; plays off the various senses of the term rock: geological, musical, and etymological, with emphasis on its derivation from the Old High German rucken: &quot;to cause to move&quot;. The term solid relates to the Cubist-influenced geometric structure, an insight prompted by the epigraph from Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Du Cubisme&quot; (1912). Combined, the &quot;rock solid&quot; signposts an emphasis on fluidity and stasis. The title&#x27;s indefinite article foregrounds this rock solid as one petite narrative among many; that is, the structure and sense are not a univocal, universalising &quot;truth&quot;. The relationship between words and painting, tied to the acoustic suggestion in the volume&#x27;s title, stress the poet&#x27;s inter-related concerns with a totality of experience. &quot;A Rock Solid&quot; &quot;has captured a sense of experimentation with form [...] It is rare in literature for a reader to have a glimpse of the poet chipping through the rock solid of experience in order to see the poem&quot; (Meyer, 88–90). Meyer&#x27;s sole review of the book also comments on its packaging and how the reader is &quot;sorting through a pile of debris&quot;. This comment underlines the reader&#x27;s engagement, where sorting through the cards enforces reflection upon the experience and the reading process.

&quot;Wood Lake Music&quot; continues the emphasis on landscape, but a greater sense of mood is evoked. In tune with the sense of foreboding, the narrator&#x27;s consciousness penetrates day-to-day rituals of renewal. The narrative employs a simple plot—the protagonist&#x27;s drive (from Vernon) past Kalamalka Lake, then Wood Lake, and finally Duck Lake and into Kelowna. Temporal structure runs from &quot;Monday, September 8, 3:30 pm&quot; through &quot;Monday, October 13, 7:00 am; 1:00 pm&quot; Time represents the specific chronological frame of the trips, while their incremental repetition offers an accretion of being in place.

In subsequent writing (&quot;Frieze&quot; and &quot;The Face in the Garden&quot;), Lent loosens his aesthetic through the application of lessons taken from Joseph Frank&#x27;s concept, spatial form, as well as its deconstructive developments—in particular the emphasis on space/place. Reviews of &quot;Frieze&quot; have been positive. Andrew Vasius, for example, applauds Lent&#x27;s use of &quot;end-line, internal, vowel and consonant rhyme for his own designs. The effect is not, as one might think, poetic conservatism, since he creates new forms through rhythmic change-ups, diction, caesura and sustained imagery&quot; (110). Yet Vasius is critical of what he perceives to be &quot;some poems [that] are so self-centred they leave a fleeting impression that Lent is translating experience into poetry&quot; (110) rather than vice versa. Further to this claim, Vasius contends that the &quot;&#x27;how&#x27; is exciting [...] whereas the &#x27;what&#x27; is often only as new and unusual as the coffee, cigarettes and booze&quot; (110) that punctuate these poems. Christopher Wiseman differs from Vasius in Wiseman&#x27;s recognition of the regional place and the vernacular that is attendant to it: &quot;The poems are rooted in real places, but these are turned into places of the mind, way-stations of the migrant heart, touchstones in the poet&#x27;s search for meaning. The search is intensified by the tonal range of the poetry, from the high serious to the most colloquial, blended smoothly and always at the poet&#x27;s service&quot; (190). Michael Estok presses further, highlighting a motif in Lent&#x27;s aesthetic: &quot;Primarily, however, Lent is an artist of the &#x27;negative space&#x27; of unadorned day-to-day existence. The stress of his rhythms is clearly on the banal, rather than on the sensational [...] The poet&#x27;s careful structure of imagery and his muscular tone—his powerful expression of the hypnotic rhythm of the ordinary—elicit our confidence in his ability to redeem the commonplace&quot; (9). Cheryl Sutherland, in a fine, close reading of several poems, evokes the volume&#x27;s core: &quot;he finds precision satisfying [and so] the task he has taken upon himself is to release the petrified voices of those who have lacked the vocabulary; he fashions a frieze from their silence&quot; (Sutherland, np).

&quot;The Face in the Garden&quot; explores subjectivity by using prose and poetry to refer to external and internal states of consciousness. The author&#x27;s linguistic dexterity underscores the sense of mobility as a theme in life and in literature. The volume is, however, a transitional moment in the writer&#x27;s career. On the one hand it presents his first published stories; while, on the other, it consolidates his accomplishments as a poet. Reviews of this experimental book range from the journalistic boorishness of John Moore to academic criticism. Elizabeth St. Jacques, in &quot;Freelance&quot;, sees the work as the story of Peter Bendy, wherein &quot;Boredom [...] has become his companion enemy that follows him on the long search to find his own &#x27;face in the garden&#x27; of life&quot; (38). St. Jacques faults the weakness of Bendy&#x27;s character, the prose stories, that &quot;come across as mini-lectures&quot; and applauds the poetry, where &quot;Lent allows his sensitivity and calm spirit to surface&quot; (38). Professor R. G. Moyles concentrates on the title, offering an explication of &quot;face&quot; as many and &quot;garden&quot; as metaphor for life. He views &quot;Towards the Gardens&quot; as about &quot;family upbringing and its emotional energy&quot;, while &quot;In the Gardens&quot; and &quot;Facing the Gardens&quot; present &quot;physical and psychical&quot; (n.p.) terrain. John Le Blanc&#x27;s review is the most considered, though readers are likely to find room for argument with his conclusion: &quot;[T]he shift to poetry in the last third of the work [exchanges] an analyzing consciousness [with] a verse that, in its imagistic terseness, is more coldly remote than engagingly elemental&quot; (180). While there is much to agree with in Le Blanc&#x27;s piece, the shift to poetry, far from being remote, is an imagistic expression that complements the analyzing consciousness. The point is not body versus mind, but rather body and mind—a fusion and a &#x27;return&#x27; to that originary garden, Eden, where humans could be.

&quot;Monet&#x27;s Garden&quot; is a discontinuous narrative of asymmetrical structure – an interweaving of connected stories with elliptical, interconnected pieces on the narrator of the book. The injection of a jazzy structure forcefully creates a three-dimensional literary space, perhaps at the expense of character, while in &quot;Black Horses, Cobalt Suns&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; (a poetic broadsheet, 2003), the poet opens out to societal concerns. The reviews are plentiful and consistently positive for &quot;Monet&#x27;s Garden&quot;, Lent&#x27;s major prose achievement prior to the publication of &quot;So It Won&#x27;t Go Away&quot;. For example, Britt Hagarty writes of the &quot;many descriptive passages worthy of quotation&quot; (G6). Hagarty also notes that the book &quot;succeeds powerfully at first. But its initial promise is not kept&quot; (G6). Allan Brown perceptively parallels &quot;Monet&#x27;s Garden&quot; &quot;both of intention and general effect, to his poetry collection &quot;Wood Lake Music&quot;&quot;. Thematically, Brown observes: &quot;There is some sadness in the new book with its tactful yet poignant descriptions of the ravages of alcoholism and the uncertain emotional relationships of an over-extended family. But there are moments of secure joy as well: moments, rather, that isolate, emphasize, and partly recreate a repeated joyfulness, often caught up in the perception of things.&quot; In his review of five new BC books, Brown concludes that, comparatively, &quot;Lent has probably come closest of all these authors to what Charles Lillard [...] called &#x27;a coming-to-terms with the landscape&#x27;—of B.C., or anywhere else.&quot; Dallas Harrison&#x27;s observations are similar, though high praise of Lent&#x27;s descriptive power is forthcoming in Harrison&#x27;s summary of Jane&#x27;s narrative as &quot;a crisis of selfhood in London worthy of Antoine Roquentin in Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Nausea&quot;&quot; (113). Harrison misses the point with respect to the Roof sequence when he suggests their deletion, &quot;abstract meditations that add little to the portrait of the family&quot; (113); however, he rightly notes that &quot;[t]hese autobiographically influenced stories suffer somewhat from John Lent&#x27;s controlling consciousness, evident in the similarity of characters [...]&quot; (113). Valerie Compton&#x27;s review in &quot;The Edmonton Journal&quot; displays the inattentiveness of the reviewer, especially to the book&#x27;s structural experiment. See McLuckie&#x27;s review for a contrasting perspective. Susan Patrick&#x27;s capsule review emphasises the predominantly &quot;psychological&quot; nature of the stories, while also joining the chorus of reviewers who applaud Lent&#x27;s &quot;strong sense of place [that] has the ability to put the reader into both the emotional and physical landscapes of his characters&quot; (3123).

&quot;Black Horses, Cobalt Suns: new poems&quot; is John Lent&#x27;s sixth published book, his fourth of poetry. Based on revisions to a &quot;sonnet cycle&quot; completed in 1995, this chapbook contains the original twelve poems reworked as ten free verse lyrics, with a reflective &quot;prologue&quot;. The new edition incorporates a governing epigraph from Robert Kroetsch&#x27;s &quot;The Crow Journals&quot; (1980). &quot;Abandonment&quot; is the catalyst, where &quot;People without names&quot; is the thematic core (i.e., to exist outside the rational labelling consciousness). The question governs Lent&#x27;s investigation of self in place. Historically, the sonnet cycle has some provenance in a varied number of poems governed by an intellectual pattern. The question posed in the epigraph is that pattern, with a movement from loss and depression to a slow renewal of an expressive vision and cautious hope. For Lent, cultural critique is central to the cycle, as his &quot;Prologue&quot; makes clear. Lent sees the horses as a metaphor for human (dis)connectedness: &quot;hooves thundering through the reader&#x27;s veins, racing over the planet with a passion that is out of us, sometimes turned against itself, sadly&quot;. The second metaphor, also foregrounded in the title, is the representation of place: &quot;In the summer here in the Okanagan [...] there is a shade of cobalt blue that can be so intense it&#x27;s overwhelming, and you get this gold and silver of the sun shredding it, shattering it, burnishing it, as it goes down.&quot; The interconnection of the horses moving out to meet the in-coming sun creates a crease, a physical epiphany that assures humanity is in the right place.

&quot;So It Won&#x27;t Go Away&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Monet&#x27;s Garden&quot;, dazzles with its open, looser structure, inviting the reader—as do each of Lent&#x27;s works by different means—to an engaged participation in text and in life. Devastating critiques of late capitalism, with an attendant and demonstrable human agency, bring the writer&#x27;s aesthetic, calmly, quietly, forcefully to fruition. Cherie Thiessen writes that &quot;The short stories in &quot;So It Won&#x27;t Go Away&quot; are not plot-driven narratives. Instead they flip around in time, place and point of view, incorporating first, second and third-person perspectives. Lent&#x27;s dozen stories get as close to three-dimensional writing as is possible.&quot; Paul Denham, notes the struggle a critic faces with the book and labels but also sees that struggle as an impediment &quot;from its real emotional power of a story (or series of stories, if you prefer) about the joy and pain of being a family.&quot; Two reviews in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; concentrate on structure and theme. Wiersema places emphasis on structure: &quot;Interestingly, the creator never creates a position of privilege for himself; his story is as fictive, and as truthful-feeling, as the &quot;bigger, impossible story&quot; of the Connelly siblings, and becomes another strand in the complex and utterly winning tale Lent is spinning.&quot; While Sandborn offers a thematic overview: &quot;The book works both as a straightforward story of family pain, addiction, love and redemption, and as a highly intelligent meditation on the process of writing itself.&quot;

Lent&#x27;s recent novel, &quot;The Path to Ardroe&quot; (2012) embodies Lent&#x27;s interests in jazz, being, consciousness, landscape and the self. The thematic core is, for lack of better phrasing, a spiritual existentialism—how a human can just be in the world. Another way to cast the theme and, in several respects, the approach may be likened to the following: &quot;It is, of course, an operation to unblock the heart but a tricky one, where you have to go in through the head without getting trapped there.&quot; Steven W. Beattie, in his &quot;National Post&quot; review of the novel has caught its place in Lent&#x27;s oeuvre: &quot;If &quot;So It Won&#x27;t Go Away&quot; is a series of distinct riffs and trills, &quot;The Path to Ardroe&quot; more closely resembles a symphony, with a number of different movements circling around a central theme.&quot;

Lengthier analyses of Lent&#x27;s work are found in Craig McLuckie&#x27;s &quot;Improvisation of Self and Other in John Lent&#x27;s Developing Aesthetic&quot;, which offers coverage of the published work (excluding songs) up to &quot;Black Horses, Cobalt Suns&quot;, and the book length conversation on writing conducted with Robert Kroetsch, &quot;Abundance&quot;, which offers significant insight to Lent&#x27;s creative praxis generally and to &quot;So It Won&#x27;t Go Away&quot; specifically. Kootenay writer Angie Abdou, reviewing the book, remarks &quot; In &quot;Abundance&quot;, readers are immersed in an intimate conversation between two greats of Canadian literature—great teachers, great writers, great minds.&quot;
