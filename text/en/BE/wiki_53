<text>The Cardiff Giant was one of the most famous archaeological hoaxes in American history. It was a , roughly 3,000 pound purported &quot;petrified man&quot;, uncovered on October 16, 1869, by workers digging a well behind the barn of William C. &quot;Stub&quot; Newell, in Cardiff, New York. He covered the giant with a tent and it soon became an attraction site. Both it and an unauthorized copy made by P. T. Barnum are still being displayed. P. T. Barnum&#x27;s is on display at Marvin&#x27;s Marvelous Mechanical Museum in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

==Creation and discovery==
The giant was the creation of a New York tobacconist named George Hull. He was deeply attracted to science and especially to the theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. Hull got into an argument with Reverend Turk and his supporters at a Methodist revival meeting about Genesis 6:4, which states that there were giants who once lived on Earth. Hull, a skeptic, being the minority party, lost the argument. Angered by his defeat and the credulity of people, Hull wanted to prove how easily he could fool people with a fake giant.

The idea of a petrified man did not originate with Hull, however. During 1858, the newspaper &quot;Alta California&quot; had published a fake letter claiming that a prospector had been petrified when he had drunk a liquid within a geode. Other newspapers had also published stories of supposedly petrified people.

In 1868, Hull, accompanied by a man named H. B. Martin, hired men to quarry out a block of gypsum in Fort Dodge, Iowa, telling them it was intended for a monument to Abraham Lincoln in New York. He shipped the block to Edward Burkhardt in Chicago, a German stonecutter. Burkhardt hired two sculptors named Henry Salle and Fred Mohrmann to create the giant. While it is not clear if Burkhardt was aware of Hull&#x27;s intentions, it is reported that they took steps to cover up their work during the carving, putting up quilts to lessen the sound of carving.

The giant was designed to imitate the form of Hull himself. Hull consulted a geologist and learned that hairs would not be petrified, so he removed the hair and beard from the giant. The length of the giant was and it weighed .

Various stains and acids were used to make the giant appear to be old and weathered. In order for the giant to look ancient, Hull first wiped the giant using a sponge soaked with sand and water. The giant&#x27;s surface was beaten with steel knitting needles embedded in a board to simulate pores. The giant was also rubbed with sulphuric acid to create a deeper, vintage-like color. During November 1868, Hull transported the giant by railroad to the farm of his cousin, William Newell. By then, he had spent for the hoax.

On a night in late November 1868, the giant was buried in a hole in Newell&#x27;s farm. Nearly a year later, Newell hired Gideon Emmons and Henry Nichols, ostensibly to dig a well, and on October 16, 1869, they found the giant. One of the men reportedly exclaimed, &quot;I declare, some old Indian has been buried here!&quot;

==Exhibition and exposure as fraud==
On the first day, visitors were able to view the giant with no fee charged. The next day, a tent was set up on the discovery site and Newell charged each visitor fifty cents for a fifteen-minute session of viewing the giant. The number of visitors went to about three to five hundred per day as the demand for wagons and carriages dramatically increased. The townspeople also gained huge profit because of the Cardiff Giant. The hotels and restaurants in Cardiff saw more customers in those four days than they had ever seen before.

Some believed this giant was a petrified man, while some believed it was a statue. Those who believed it was a petrified man thought it was one of the giants mentioned in the aforementioned Genesis verse. On the other hand, John F. Boynton, the first geologist to examine the giant, declared that it could not be a fossilized man, but hypothesized that it was a statue that was carved by a French Jesuit in the 16th or 17th century in order to impress the local Native Americans.

Andrew D. White, the first president of Cornell University, made a close inspection of the Cardiff Giant. He noticed that there was no good reason to try to dig a well in the exact spot the giant had been found.

However, he was taken aback by the channels on the bottom part of the giant, stating that for such grooving to be created on local Onondaga grey limestone would require years.

Yale paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh examined the statue, pointing out that it was made of soluble gypsum, which, had it been buried in its blanket of wet earth for centuries, would not still have fresh tool marks on it (which it did), and termed it &quot;a most decided humbug&quot;. Some theologians and preachers, however, defended its authenticity.

Eventually, Hull sold his part-interest for to a syndicate of five men headed by David Hannum. They moved it to Syracuse, New York, for exhibition. The giant drew such crowds that showman P. T. Barnum offered $50,000 for the giant. When the syndicate refused, he hired a man to model the giant&#x27;s shape covertly in wax and create a plaster copy. He displayed his giant in New York, claiming that his was the real giant, and the Cardiff Giant was a fake.

As the newspapers reported Barnum&#x27;s version of the story, David Hannum was quoted as saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute&quot; in reference to spectators paying to see Barnum&#x27;s giant. Since then, the quotation has often been misattributed to Barnum himself.

Hannum sued Barnum for calling his giant a fake, but the judge told him to get his giant to swear on his own genuineness in court if he wanted a favorable injunction.

On December 10, 1869, Hull confessed everything to the press, and on February 2, 1870, both giants were revealed as fakes in court; the judge also ruled that Barnum could not be sued for terming a fake giant a fake. Hull proclaimed that he did not confess because of the pressing criticism, but confessed proudly that he intended for the hoax to be exposed to reveal the tendency of the Christian community to believe in things too easily and to counter the fundamentalist belief that giants once roamed the earth.

==Subsequent and current resting places==
The Cardiff Giant was displayed at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, but did not attract much attention.
Iowa publisher Gardner Cowles, Jr., bought it later to adorn his basement rumpus room as a coffee table and conversation piece. In 1947, he sold it to the Farmers&#x27; Museum in Cooperstown, New York, where it is still displayed.

The owner of Marvin&#x27;s Marvelous Mechanical Museum, a coin-operated game arcade and museum of oddities in Farmington Hills, Michigan, has said that the copy displayed there is Barnum&#x27;s.

A copy of the Giant is displayed at The Fort Museum and Frontier Village in Fort Dodge, Iowa.

==Imitators==
The Cardiff Giant has inspired a number of similar hoaxes.
* In 1876, the Solid Muldoon was exhibited in Beulah, Colorado, at 50 cents a ticket. There was also a rumor that Barnum had offered to buy it for $20,000. One employer later revealed that this was also a creation of George Hull, aided by Willian Conant. The Solid Muldoon was made of clay, ground bones, meat, rock dust, and plaster.
* In 1879, the owner of a hotel at what is now Taughannock Falls State Park hired men to create a fake petrified man and place it where workmen would dig it up. One of the men who had buried the giant later revealed the truth when drunk.
* During 1897, a petrified man found downriver from Fort Benton, Montana, was claimed by promoters to be the remains of former territorial governor and U.S. Civil War General Thomas Francis Meagher. Meagher had drowned in the Missouri River during 1867. The petrified man was displayed across Montana as a novelty and exhibited in New York and Chicago.

== In popular culture ==

* In &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;, the fictional Cardiff Giant personal computer is named after the petrified man.
* &quot;Cardiff Giant&quot; is a song on the 2012 album &quot;Ten Stories&quot; by the band mewithoutYou.
* Mark Twain&#x27;s 1869 short story &quot;The Legend of the Capitoline Venus&quot; was inspired by the Cardiff Giant, and the ghost of the Giant is a character in Twain&#x27;s 1870 short story &quot;A Ghost Story&quot;.
* A character called the Cardiff Giant appeared occasionally in the early years of the newspaper comic &quot;Alley Oop&quot;.
* The 1997 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot; was inspired by the Cardiff Giant, the Piltdown Man, and the Scopes trial.
* Myron Edward Batesole was a professional wrestler during the 1940s and 50s billed as &quot;The Cardiff Giant&quot;.
* Power-violence band Spazz used an image of the Cardiff Giant for their album &quot;Dwarf Jester Rising&quot;.

<doc id="284882" wikidata="Q364890" url="?curid=284882" title="Dave Davies">
<text>David Russell Gordon Davies ( &quot;&quot;; born 3 February 1947) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the English rock band the Kinks, led by his older brother (and principal writer and singer) Ray. Davies also sometimes undertook writing and/or lead vocals duties within the band, for example on songs such as &quot;Death of a Clown&quot;, &quot;Party Line&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Rats&quot;. He has also embarked on a solo career, releasing several singles during the late 1960s and has since released eight solo albums.

Davies is prolific with his innovative nature on the electric guitar, specifically in being one of the first to use electric guitar distortion and exposing the effect to the mainstream. His signature distorted power chord riffs on songs would heavily influence future heavy metal and punk rock acts. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a member of the Kinks and, in 2003, was ranked 91st in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

==Early life==

David Russell Gordon Davies was born at 6 Denmark Terrace, Muswell Hill, North London. He was born the last of eight children, including six older sisters and an elder brother, later bandmate Ray. As children, the Davies brothers were immersed in a world of different musical styles, from the music hall of their parents&#x27; generation, to the jazz and early rock n&#x27; roll that their older sisters listened to. The siblings developed a rivalry early on, with both brothers competing for their parents&#x27; and sisters&#x27; attention.

His father, Frederick George Davies, was a slaughterhouse worker. Frederick liked to hang out in pubs and was considered a ladies&#x27; man. He was born in Islington and his registered birth name was Frederick George Kelly.

Frederick&#x27;s father, Henry Kelly, was a greengrocer who married Amy Elizabeth Smith at St Luke&#x27;s Church in Kentish Town in 1887, and they had two children, Charles Henry and Frederick George. However, the marriage failed and Amy moved in with Harry Davies, bringing her two small children and her mother. Harry Davies, born in Minsterley in 1878, was an ostler who had moved with his family from Shropshire to Islington. Frederick George had changed his surname to Davies by the time he married Annie Florence Willmore (1905–1987) in Islington in 1924. Annie came from a &quot;sprawling family&quot;. She had a sharp tongue and could be crude and forceful.

When Davies was still a small child, one of his older sisters became a star of the dance halls, and soon had a child out of wedlock by an African man, an undocumented immigrant who subsequently disappeared from her life. The child, a daughter, was ultimately raised by Ray&#x27;s mother. The oldest Davies daughter, Rene, died at the age of 31 from a heart attack on the day before Ray&#x27;s 13th birthday, while she was out dancing at the Lyceum Ballroom in the Strand, London in June 1957.

Davies grew up playing skiffle, but soon bought an electric guitar and started experimenting with rock. The Davies brothers and friend Pete Quaife jammed together in the front room of their house. Activities in the Davies household centred around this front room, culminating in large parties, where the parents would sing and play piano together. The front room and these parties were musically nurturing to the Davies brothers, later influencing the Kinks&#x27; interpretations of the traditional British music hall style. Dave and his brother worked out the famous two-chord riff of their 1964 hit &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; on the piano in the front room.

==Career==

Davies founded the Kinks with Pete Quaife in 1963. His brother Ray, who became the best-known member and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the band, joined soon after. The quartet was formed when drummer Mick Avory joined. Dave Davies had a turbulent relationship with Avory, one of the reasons behind the latter&#x27;s departure from the band in the mid-1980s, although the two had been housemates together in the mid-1960s.

Ray and Dave Davies remained the only two steady members of the band. They were accompanied by an oft-changing roster of bassists and keyboardists. Dave played a largely subordinate role to his brother, often staying behind the scenes. Dave would make occasional contributions on Kinks records as lead vocalist and songwriter, with classics such as &quot;Party Line&quot; (the lyrics were written by Ray and the song has been attributed to Ray on many editions of &quot;Face to Face&quot;), &quot;Death of a Clown&quot; and &quot;Strangers&quot;.

===Early years (1963–1966)===
The Kinks were signed to Pye Records in late 1963, and Dave Davies turned 17 three days before the first Kinks single (a version of &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;) was issued in early 1964. Davies was solely responsible for the signature distorted power chord sound on the Kinks&#x27; first hit, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. He achieved the sound by using a razor blade to slit the speaker cone on his Elpico amplifier, which he then ran through a larger Vox as a &quot;pre-amp&quot;. This sound was one of the first mainstream appearances of distortion, which was to have a major influence on many later musicians, especially in heavy metal and punk rock.

&quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was the band&#x27;s third released single, the two previous recordings having failed to chart. They had a three-single contract with Pye Records, and needed a hit to get another. Pye didn&#x27;t like the song and refused to pay for studio time. The band arranged other financial support to cut the single, which became a hit, topping the charts in the UK and reaching number 7 in the US.

The Kinks released three albums and several EPs in the next two years. They also performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours with the likes of The Yardbirds and The Mickey Finn, which caused tension within the band. Some legendary on-stage fights erupted during this time as well. The most notorious incident was at the Capitol Theatre in Cardiff in May 1965, involving drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies. The fight broke out during the second number of the set, &quot;Beautiful Delilah&quot;. It culminated with Davies insulting Avory and kicking over his drum set after finishing the first song, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. Avory responded by knocking down Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious. He then fled from the scene and Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to the head. Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.

During the late 1960s the group steadily evolved, as Ray&#x27;s songwriting skills developed and he began to lead the group in a new direction. The group abandoned the traditional R&amp;B/blues sound and adopted a more nostalgic, reflective style of music, as showcased on songs like &quot;Autumn Almanac&quot; and &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, as well as their albums, such as &quot;Something Else by the Kinks&quot; and &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot;.

===Late 1960s and solo career===

In July 1967, Dave Davies released his first solo single, &quot;Death of a Clown&quot;, credited entirely under his name as the recording artist, though it was co-written by his brother. Previously, as a member of the Kinks, Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on B-sides and albums. Pye Records, the Kinks&#x27; label, sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies and issued &quot;Death of a Clown&quot; as his debut. Although the single was credited to Davies, the backing band was the Kinks, and the track also appeared on &quot;Something Else by the Kinks&quot;.

&quot;Death of a Clown&quot; rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart. Wanting to profit from the new buzz suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was slated for release sometime in 1968 or 1969. The follow-up single, &quot;Susannah&#x27;s Still Alive&quot;, was released in November 1967; however, it only reached number 20 on the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; chart. The release of the solo album was held back, and it was decided to wait and see how another single would fare. As anticipation grew for the release of the new LP, it was nicknamed &quot;A Hole in the Sock Of&quot;. &quot;Lincoln County&quot; was chosen as the next single, but it failed to chart. By the time a fourth single, &quot;Hold My Hand&quot;, met with the same result, a combination of his own lack of interest in continuing and Pye&#x27;s decision to stop killed off any hopes of an album.

Eventually, the tracks intended for his first solo album were assembled for a 2011 compilation by Russell Smith &amp; Andrew Sandoval entitled &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot;. It combined the singles, B-sides that were released for various Kinks singles and a handful of album tracks that Davies had recorded for Kinks albums. Many of these tracks had been assembled previously for &quot;The Album That Never Was&quot;, released in 1987.

&quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; and &quot;Arthur&quot; were released in 1968 and 1969, respectively. Although they received unanimous acclaim, &quot;Village Green&quot; failed to chart internationally, and &quot;Arthur&quot; was met with a mediocre commercial reception. These records, although praised by critics and the rock press, were commercial failures.

===&quot;Lola&quot;, &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot;, and theatrical incarnation===
After &quot;Arthur&quot;, the Kinks made a comeback with their hit single &quot;Lola&quot; and the accompanying concept album &quot;Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; in 1970. Dave recorded two songs of his own for this LP, the acoustic &quot;Strangers&quot; and the hard-rocking &quot;Rats&quot;. The rootsy &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot;, themed on country-rock and Americana, was released in late 1971 and was well-received with critics, but failed to sell strongly. The band&#x27;s next five albums, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s in Show-Biz&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Kinks Present A Soap Opera&quot; and &quot;Schoolboys in Disgrace&quot;, which added a large theatrical ensemble, were critical and commercial failures.

The Kinks left RCA Records in 1977, switching to Arista. The group shed all of the extra backing vocalists and brass instrumentalists that had accompanied them throughout their theatrical years, and reverted to a five-piece rock group again. Their debut LP for Arista was entitled &quot;Sleepwalker&quot;, and was a commercial and critical comeback for the group. It was the first album in what critics usually call the &quot;arena rock&quot; phase of the group, in which more commercial and mainstream production techniques would be employed. Dave later commented that he was glad to be back to more guitar-oriented songs, and he has listed &quot;Sleepwalker&quot; as one of his favourites.

===1980s and onward===

Davies saw the band through both success and failure, as they reached their commercial peak in the early 1980s. The group began adjusting their commercial methods, embracing the MTV culture that was selling records at the time. The music video for their 1982/83 single &quot;Come Dancing&quot; helped hoist the record to number 12 on the UK chart, and number 6 in the US – their biggest hit since &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot; in 1965.

The Kinks&#x27; popularity faltered in 1985, and soon their records ceased to chart altogether. Mick Avory left the band after the Kinks&#x27; last album for Arista, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, mainly due to the growing animosity between him and Dave Davies. Bob Henrit was brought in to take Avory&#x27;s place. At the invitation of Ray Davies, Avory agreed to manage Konk Studios, where he also served as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.

The group switched to MCA (US) and London (UK) records in late 1985, and began work on their next album, &quot;Think Visual&quot;. The record was released in 1986, but only reached number 81 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Critics were lukewarm towards it, and it did not receive significant radio play. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic.com later commented that the album &quot;represented an artistic dead end for the Kinks, as Ray Davies continued to crank out a series of competent, but undistinguished hard rockers.&quot; Dave Davies contributed two songs to &quot;Think Visual&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Cities&quot; and &quot;When You were a Child&quot;.

The group recorded several more records for MCA, their last studio effort for them being 1989&#x27;s &quot;UK Jive&quot;. It was received slightly better than &quot;Think Visual&quot;, but it failed to enter into the Top 100. Dave Davies contributed the song &quot;Dear Margaret&quot; to the vinyl record – the cassette and CD of the album also contained two further Dave Davies songs, &quot;Bright Lights&quot; and &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;.

The group left MCA and struggled to find a record label that would accept them. All four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, but this failed to revive their career. Eventually the Kinks signed to Columbia Records, who released their final studio album together, &quot;Phobia&quot;, on 13 April 1993. Despite publicity and press attention, the record was unsuccessful, peaking at number 166. Singles released failed to chart as well. To &quot;Phobia&quot; Davies contributed the songs &quot;It&#x27;s Alright (Don&#x27;t Think About It)&quot; and &quot;Close to the Wire&quot;.

Columbia dropped the group in 1994, forcing them to retreat to their old Konk Records. The group released &quot;To The Bone&quot; on the small independent Grapevine Records in 1994.

The Kinks took a break from recording and touring in 1996. Ray and Dave reunited onstage to perform &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; at the Islington Assembly Hall in London on 18 December 2015. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called their performance &quot;rousing&quot;.

====Solo work, 1980s–present day====
After the aborted solo effort, Davies&#x27;s solo career was not revived until 1980, with the release of &quot;Dave Davies (AFL1-3603)&quot;, which featured Davies performing all the instruments himself. The album, named after its own catalog number, peaked at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. He went on to release &quot;Glamour&quot; (1981), which charted at number 152. Davies brought in a back-up band to play with him on this record. &quot;Chosen People&quot; was released in 1983, but failed to crack the Billboard 200.

Davies released his first true solo studio album in twenty years, &quot;Bug&quot;, in 2002. &quot;Fractured Mindz&quot; followed in January 2007. It was also his first new studio effort since his stroke in the summer of 2004 besides the track &quot;God in my Brain&quot; (which was recorded and released on the compilation album &quot;Kinked&quot; in January 2006).

&quot;Two Worlds&quot; was recorded throughout 2010 by The Aschere Project, the production team of Dave Davies and his son Russ. Both members wrote, produced, and recorded all the tracks. About the album&#x27;s genre, Dave stated &quot;it&#x27;s a mixture of rock, kinda classical and electronic music.&quot; In February 2010, Davies released an autobiographical DVD filmed by his other son, titled &quot;Mystical Journey&quot;. His planned US tour in support of the release was postponed per doctor&#x27;s advice. It was announced in February 2013 that on 4 June 2013, Davies would be releasing his sixth studio album entitled &quot;I Will Be Me&quot; worldwide. Davies undertook a short tour of the US to promote the album. Davies performed his first UK show in thirteen years in February 2014. In October 2014, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Kinks, a new album by Davies, with many tracks looking back to the start of the band, titled &quot;Rippin&#x27; Up Time&quot; was released. Davies appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; to promote the album in 2014. This episode was the highest rated &quot;Tonight Show&quot; episode in 2014.

In 2015, the Dave Davies solo album &quot;Rippin Up New York City&quot; was released on Red River Entertainment. He embarked on a solo tour to promote the album in the US in October and November. On 18 December, at his concert at the Islington Assembly Hall in London, he was joined onstage by Ray to perform the Kinks&#x27; hit &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; together. This marked the first time in nearly 20 years that the brothers had appeared and performed together.

==Signature instruments==
Davies has played a number of guitars over time, the most recognizable of which is his Gibson Flying V. Davies bought it in 1965, and soon began appearing live and on TV performances with it. Davies was one of the few guitarists who played Flying Vs at the time. It was, in that period, out of issue due to lack of interest upon its 1958 test release, and models were numbered. Guitarists such as Lonnie Mack, Jimi Hendrix, Albert King and Davies himself helped stir interest in the instrument, and it would eventually become one of the signature guitars of the heavy metal era.

Davies commented on his Flying V:

Davies has played many other guitars throughout his career. He has played several models of Gibson Les Pauls over time, including a &quot;Goldtop&quot; model with P90 pickups and a black &#x27;78 model. On his website he lists the following:
* Gibson Les Paul – Standard, Custom, Deluxe, Artisan and Goldtop models
* Fender Elite Telecaster
* Fender American Standard Telecaster
* &#x27;63 Fender Telecaster sunburst (owned by Ray, used as Dave&#x27;s main guitar between 1967 and 1969)
* &#x27;54 Fender Stratocaster
* Gibson Flying V
* Gibson L5-S
* Gibson L6-S
* Guild F-512 NT 12-string acoustic
* Harmony Meteor

==Personal life and health==
Davies was expelled from school at the age of 15 after being caught having sex with his girlfriend, Sue Sheehan, on Hampstead Heath. Shortly thereafter, they were forced to separate by their respective families after Sheehan found out she was pregnant. Their relationship had a profound impact on Davies, who wrote a number of songs about their separation including &quot;Funny Face&quot;, &quot;Susannah&#x27;s Still Alive&quot;, and &quot;Mindless Child of Motherhood&quot;. In 1967, Davies married Lisbet (a cousin of Pete Quaife&#x27;s first wife, Annette) and they divorced in 1990. From that marriage, Davies has four sons: Martin, Simon, Christian, and Russell. His three children Daniel, Lana, and Eddie are from a relationship with Nancy Evans. Davies briefly reunited with Sue Sheehan in the late 1990s.

Davies published an autobiography, entitled &quot;Kink&quot; in 1996, in which he discussed his bisexuality and brief relationships with Long John Baldry and music producer Michael Aldred in the late 1960s. He also wrote of the tense professional relationship with his brother over the Kinks&#x27; career.

Davies has been vegetarian since the late 1960s, and has said that he does not think meat is good for the nervous system.

On 30 June 2004, Davies suffered a stroke while exiting a lift at Broadcasting House, where he had been promoting his album, &quot;Bug&quot;. He was taken to University College Hospital near Euston Square tube station. Davies was released from the hospital on 27 August. By 2006, Davies had recovered enough to be able to walk, talk and play the guitar.

In September 2013 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote about Davies and his girlfriend Rebecca G. Wilson. She contributed backing vocals to the songs &quot;Front Room&quot; and &quot;King of Karaoke&quot;. Since 2014, Wilson has gone on tour as Davies&#x27; backup singer.

A second autobiography, &quot;Living on a Thin Line&quot; (), was released in July 2022. The book&#x27;s title is shared by a Kinks track released in 1984. Davies details in the book how in 1982, while on tour in the US, he started hearing voices. He claims that those voices were alien in origin and the aliens, who he named &quot;the intelligences&quot;, controlled both his body and mind. Davies also discussed his leaving of wives and children when relationships were outgrown.

<text>Local government in Scotland comprises thirty-two local authorities, commonly referred to as &quot;councils&quot;. Each council provides public services, including education, social care, waste management, libraries and planning. Councils receive the majority of their funding from the Scottish Government, but operate independently and are accountable to their local electorates. Councils raise additional income via the Council Tax, a locally variable domestic property tax, and Business rates, a non-domestic property tax.

Councils are made up of councillors who are directly elected by the residents of the area they represent. Each council area is divided into a number of wards, and three or four councillors are elected for each ward. There are currently 1,227 elected councillors in Scotland. Local elections are normally held every five years and use the single transferable vote electoral system. The most recent election was the 2022 Scottish local elections and the next election will be the 2027 Scottish local elections.

Council administrations typically comprise a group of councillors within the council who are able to command majority support. Minority administrations and majority administrations may be formed. Although coalition administrations are more typical, occasionally a majority administration is formed by a single political party, but this is uncommon due to the proportional voting system used in Scottish local elections. Despite being uncommon on the Scottish mainland, it is possible for independent politicians to form an administration.

The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) is an umbrella organisation formed in 1975 to represent the views of Scotland&#x27;s thirty-two councils to central government.

==History==
===Origins===
The history of Scottish local government mainly surrounds involves the counties of Scotland. The counties have their origins in the sheriffdoms or shires over which a sheriff (a contraction of &quot;shire reeve&quot;) exercised jurisdiction.

Malcolm III appears to have introduced sheriffs as part of a policy of replacing native &quot;Celtic&quot; forms of government with Anglo Saxon and French feudal structures. This was continued by his sons Edgar, Alexander I and in particular David I. David completed the division of the country into sheriffdoms by the conversion of existing thanedoms.

From the seventeenth century the shires started to be used for local administration apart from judicial functions. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom to collect the land tax. The commissioners eventually assumed other duties in the county. In 1858, police forces were established in each county under the Police (Scotland) Act 1857.

As a result of the dual system of local government, burghs (of which there were various types) often had a high degree of autonomy.

===Modern history===

Between 1890 and 1975 local government in Scotland was organised with county councils (including four &quot;counties of cities&quot;) and various lower-level units. Between 1890 and 1929, there were parish councils and town councils, but with the passing of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929, the functions of parish councils were passed to larger district councils and a distinction was made between large burghs (i.e. those with a population of 20,000 or more) and small burghs. This system was further refined by the passing of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947.

Effective from 1975, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 passed by the Conservative government of Edward Heath introduced a system of two-tier local government in Scotland (see Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996), divided between large regional councils and smaller district councils. The only exceptions to this were the three island councils, Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney which had the combined powers of regions and districts. The Conservative government of John Major (1990–1997) decided to abolish this system and merge their powers into new unitary authorities. The new councils vary wildly in size – some are the same as counties, such as Clackmannanshire, some are the same as former districts, such as Inverclyde, and some are the same as the former regions, such as Highland. The changes took effect in 1996 with shadow councillors elected in 1995 to oversee the smooth transition of control.

In 2007, council elections moved to the single transferable vote system, with wards represented by either three or four councillors. The transition has resulted in no uncontested seats and has ended single-party controlled councils.

In 2016 there were ward boundary changes in 25 local authority areas, following the Scottish Government accepting some of the recommendations of Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland.

The Islands (Scotland) Act 2018 and the Scottish Elections (Reform) Act 2020 have given Boundaries Scotland increased flexibility to vary the size of wards. Mainland wards may now have between 2 and 5 councillors, and single councillor wards are permitted where such a ward includes an inhabited island.

==Governance and administration==
The power vested in local authorities is administered by elected councillors. There are currently 1,227 councillors, each paid a part-time salary for the undertaking of their duties. In total, there are 32 unitary authorities, the largest being the Glasgow City with more than 600,000 inhabitants, the smallest, Orkney, with just over 20,000 people living there (population of 21,670 in 2015).

Councillors are subject to a Code of Conduct instituted by the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 and enforced by the Standards Commission for Scotland. If a person believes that a councillor has broken the code of conduct they make a complaint to the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland (CESPLS). The Commissioner makes a determination on whether there is a need for an investigation, and then whether or not to refer the matter to the Standards Commission.

===Provost===

Each council elects a provost from among the members of the council to chair meetings and to act as a figurehead for the area. A council may also elect a depute provost, though this is not required. In the four cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee the provost is called a Lord Provost, whilst in other councils the council may choose another title for their provost or conveners. Most councils use the term &#x27;provost&#x27;, some use the term &#x27;convener&#x27;.

The office of provost or convener is roughly equivalent to that of a mayor in other parts of the United Kingdom. Traditionally these roles are ceremonial and have no significant administrative functions. Lord provosts in the four city councils have the additional duty of acting as Lord Lieutenant for their respective city.

===Leader of the Council===
Since 2007 each council has been required to designate a &quot;leader of the council&quot; and a &quot;civic head&quot;, who receive additional remuneration for holding those roles. The regulations direct that unless a council decides otherwise the leader is the convener and the civic head is the depute convener. In practice, most authorities appoint someone other than the convener as leader of the council, such that the political leader of the council is not also presiding over the debate at council meetings. The convener or provost usually takes the civic head role. The leader of the council is usually the leader of the largest political group, or in a coalition the leader of the largest party in that coalition. The Leader of the Council has no executive or administrative powers designated by statute. Prior to 2007 many authorities recognised the leader of the largest political group or coalition administration as being leader of the council, but there was no legislative basis for the role.

===Officers===
Officers of a council are administrative, non-political staff of the council. Generally the composition of the council&#x27;s officers are a matter for the council, but there are a number of statutory officers whose roles are defined by the central government.

The most significant of these officers is the Head of Paid Service, usually titled the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive is similar in function to a city manager, though certain councillors have executive authority and there is no clear division of powers.

There is also a statutory Monitoring Officer, who usually heads the Legal Services division of the council, as well as a Chief Financial Officer.

Note: There were boundary changes in many of these councils. Notional seats and seat change are based on a notional 2012 result calculated by the BBC. The methodology was officially revealed on 9 May 2017. The relevant explanation is available on the BBC Website. Comparisons with the actual results from 2012 are inconsistent, as the number of seats and seat changes will be different because of an increase in council seats across the country from 1,223 to 1,227 and the different boundaries.

===Council control===
Political control may be held by minority governments (min), coalitions (co), joint leadership arrangements (j.l.) or partnership working arrangements (p.w.).

==2012 election results==
===Council control===
The 32 unitary authorities were controlled as follows. The figures incorporate the results from the 2012 local government election, plus gains and losses from subsequent local by-elections, and party defections. 
==2007 election results==

Following the introduction of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 local elections are held using the single transferable vote, with this taking place for the first time in 2007. This change in voting system saw all but five councils end up with no one party in control. Labour retained control of Glasgow City and North Lanarkshire, while Orkney, Shetland and Na h-Eileanan Siar continue to be controlled by Independent councillors.

==Community councils==

Community councils represent the interests of local people. Local authorities have a statutory duty to consult community councils on planning, development and other issues directly affecting that local community. However, the community council has no direct say in the delivery of services. In many areas they do not function at all, but some work very effectively at improving their local area. Elections for community councils are determined by the local authority but the law does state that candidates cannot stand on a party-political ticket.

<text>Harvey Samuel Firestone Sr. (December 20, 1868 February 7, 1938) was an American businessman, and the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, one of the first global makers of automobile tires.

==Family background==
Firestone was born in 1868 in Columbiana, Ohio, and grew up on the farm built by his grandfather. The family name was originally ; Nicholas Feuerstein, Firestone&#x27;s paternal ancestor, immigrated from Alsace in 1752 and settled in Pennsylvania. He was the second of Benjamin and Catherine (née Flickinger) Firestone&#x27;s three sons; Benjamin also had a son and a daughter by his first wife. In 1983, the original farm was disassembled and moved to Greenfield Village, a historical site in Michigan founded by Henry Ford, and is now part of a larger outdoor museum.

On November 20, 1895, Firestone married Idabelle Smith. They eventually had seven children. Notable greatgrandchildren include: Andrew Firestone, Nick Firestone, and William Clay Ford, Jr. (the son of Henry Ford&#x27;s grandson and Harvey and Idabelle&#x27;s granddaughter Martha).

==Education and career==
After graduating from Columbiana High School, Firestone worked for the Columbus Buggy Company in Columbus, Ohio before starting his own company in 1890, making rubber tires for carriages. In 1900, he founded the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. In 1926, he published a book, &quot;Men and Rubber: The Story of Business&quot;, which was written in collaboration with Samuel Crowther.

== Liberia ==

According to a joint investigation from ProPublica and PBS, Firestone - while directly working as the head of his eponymous company - orchestrated a deal with Liberia to lease over 1 million acres of land to establish a rubber plantation, the largest in the world. This plantation took up over 10% of the country&#x27;s fertile land, and the deal was set to last for 99 years. It was during this time that the Liberian government had forced indigenous villagers to work on the plantation, although investigators with the League of Nations found no evidence that Firestone itself “consciously employs labor which has been forcibly impressed&quot;. The town of Harbel was directly made as a company town for this plantation, named after Firestone and his wife, Idabelle.

This incident led his son, Harvey S. Firestone Jr., to run a public relations campaign to repair the public image of the company, portraying themselves as providing healthcare, job opportunities, and financial betterment to the region. This established an image that prevailed for decades while the company directly aided Liberian government officials in owning rubber plantations themselves, including the country&#x27;s former dictator, William V.S. Tubman, who Firestone maintained close ties with.

This farm would later be compared to “an old Southern plantation&quot; by Firestone executives. This is due to the plantation consisting of poorly paid workers who would live on company property in small, one-room dwellings with their wives and children. These dwellings lacked electricity, running water, and kitchens - with instead outhouses and communal kitchens relied on for sustenance. The workers&#x27; wives and children would often be employed as well due to a labor shortage. 

==Death==
Firestone died of coronary thrombosis at Harbel Villa, the beach front estate he acquired in Miami Beach, Florida. He was 69 years old.

==The Vagabonds ==
Firestone, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison were generally considered the three leaders in American industry at the time, and often worked and vacationed together, calling themselves the Vagabonds, along with naturalist John Burroughs and, sometimes, President Herbert Hoover.

==Legacy==
The main library of Princeton University is named Firestone Library in his honor. It is among the largest university libraries in the world. On August 3, 1950, The Harvey S. Firestone Memorial, a large sculpture ensemble dedicated to Firestone, created by sculptors James Earle Fraser and Donald De Lue was dedicated at the old Firestone Tire and Rubber Company Headquarters at 1200 Firestone Parkway. It currently located at the Bridgestone Americas Technology Center in Akron, Ohio. 

In 1974, Firestone was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. Firestone High School in Akron, Ohio, is named in his honor. There is a Harvey S. Firestone Park in Columbiana, Ohio. The Links at Firestone Farms, a golf course in Columbiana that opened in 2003, sits on the site of the former family homestead. 

He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2013.

<doc id="284891" wikidata="Q3567536" url="?curid=284891" title="Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament">
<text>The presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament (, ) is the presiding officer and speaker of the Scottish Parliament. The office of presiding officer was established by the Scotland Act 1998, and the elected presiding officer is a member of the Scottish Parliament who is elected by the Scottish Parliament by means of an exhaustive ballot, and is &quot;ex officio&quot; the head of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. The presiding officer is considered a figurehead of the Scottish Parliament and has an office in Queensberry House.

Appointments to the Privy Council are made by the monarch, although in practice they are made only on the advice of the UK government. To date all presiding officers have been appointed members of the Privy Council, and therefore entitled to use the style &#x27;Right Honourable&#x27;.

The current presiding officer is Alison Johnstone, who was elected on 13 May 2021, following the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. A member of the Scottish Greens, she was sworn in as presiding officer at the opening of the 6th session of the Scottish Parliament and is the second woman to hold the office and the first former member of the Scottish Greens to do so.

==Responsibilities of office==
===Parliamentary responsibilities===
The presiding officer presides over the Parliament&#x27;s debates, determining which members may speak, and maintains order during debate. The presiding officer is expected to be strictly non-partisan, with some similarities in this respect to the tradition of the Speaker of the House of Commons. For this reason, they renounce all affiliation with their former political party for the duration of their term. They do not take part in debate, or vote except to break ties. Even then, the convention is that when the presiding officer uses their tie-breaking vote, they do so in favour of advancing debate, but on final ballots, retaining the status quo. The presiding officer is also assisted in their duties by 2 deputies. They have the same powers as the presiding officer; they keep their party affiliation but remain impartial when presiding.

In 2006 the St Andrews Fund for Scots Heraldry commemorated the hosting of the Heraldic &amp; Genealogical Congress in Scotland by commissioning a ceremonial robe for the presiding officer to wear, however as of May 2017, it appears no presiding officer has worn the robe.

===Governmental responsibilities===

As well as being the presiding officer and speaker of the Scottish Parliament, the Presiding Officer represents Scotland and the Scottish Government and parliament within Scotland and during international visits. The Presiding Officer welcomes dignitaries from other national parliaments to study policy issues of the Scottish Government, share information on ways of working as well as exchanging ideas and knowledge. The Presiding Officer, along with other members of the Scottish Parliament, may visit other national parliaments in order to improve understanding on shared interests and developing and strengthening good working relationships.

===Legal responsibilities===

The overall responsibilities and functions of the office of the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament were detailed in the passing of the Scotland Act 1998. The act set out the responsibilities of the office in four areas; Purpose and Effect, General, Parliamentary Consideration and Details of Provisions. 

====Purpose and effect====

The purpose and effect section under Section 19 of the Scotland Act 1998 provides for the election of a Presiding Officer to the Scottish Parliament and requires two deputies to preside over the parliament. It outlines the details for the term of office of the Presiding Officer and deputies; the exercise of the Presiding Officer&#x27;s functions by a deputy if the Presiding Officer is unable to act or the office of Presiding Officer is vacant, the delegation of the Presiding Officer’s functions to a deputy and participation of the Presiding Officer and deputies in proceedings of the Parliament.

====General====

The General section of Section 19 of the Scotland Act 1998 highlight the general functions and responsibilities of the office of Presiding Officer. The Scotland Act 1998 highlights the general responsibilities of the Presiding Officer as being:

* Sections 2, 3 and 9 - recommending to the monarch the date for holding general elections and fixing the dates of by-elections;
* Sections 10 and 14 - receiving notification of a member’s resignation and of the filling of a vacancy in a regional seat;
* Section 21 - membership of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body;
* Section 26 - administering oaths to witnesses before the Parliament;
* Sections 31 to 35 - scrutiny of Bills and submission of Bills for Royal Assent; and
* Sections 45 and 46 - recommending to the monarch the Parliament&#x27;s choice of First Minister and the appointment of another member to exercise the First Minister&#x27;s functions in certain circumstances.
* The Standing Orders of the Parliament also provide that the Presiding Officer shall have such other functions as may be conferred upon him or her by the Parliament or by the Standing Orders.

====Details of provision====

Subsection (1) of Section 19 of the Scotland Act 1998 requires the Parliament following its first meeting after a general election to the Scottish Parliament has taken place, to elect from amongst its membership a Presiding Officer and two deputies. The elections have to take place after members take their oath of allegiance due to the fact that the members cannot take part in any proceedings until they have done so under section 84(2) of the Scotland Act 1998.

Subsection (2) of the Section 19 of the Scotland Act 1998 provides for the office holder of either the Presiding Officer or Deputy Presiding Officer to hold office until: 

* a new Presiding Officer is elected;
* the Presiding Officer resigns;
* the Presiding Officer ceases to be a member otherwise than by virtue of a dissolution; or
* the incumbent Presiding Officer is removed from office by resolution of the Parliament.

In Law, the Presiding Officer and the deputies will not cease to hold the office of Presiding Officer merely because of the dissolution of the Parliament before a general election. The incumbent office holders will continue to serve office until such time as the new Parliament elects a Presiding Officer (and the deputies) under subsection (1).

Subsection (3) requires members of the Scottish Parliament to elect a replacement for the Presiding Officer or a deputy who ceases to hold office for any reason before dissolution of the Parliament that may result in the Presiding Officer or a deputy leaving or being removed from the office. Subsection (4) highlights that the Presiding Officer’s functions may be exercised by a deputy if the office is vacant for whatever reason, or alternatively if the Presiding Officer is for any reason unable to act and fulfil the duties of office. Subsection (5) empowers the Presiding Officer, subject to standing orders, to authorise any deputy to exercise functions on their behalf.

Subsection (6) gives the presiding officer the power through standing orders to regulate the participation of the Presiding Officer and deputies in proceedings of the Parliament. They may cover any constraints on the way in which the Presiding Officer and deputies may vote in proceedings which they chair. Subsection (7) provides that the validity of any act of the Presiding Officer or a deputy is not affected by any defect in the election.

===Future of the role===

The Scottish National Party proposes that in the event of independence, the presiding officer&#x27;s post be replaced with that of chancellor of Scotland. In addition to presiding over the Scottish Parliament, the chancellor would possess additional constitutional powers during the absence of the monarch from Scotland; chiefly, the chancellor should act in a role similar to a governor-general in the other Commonwealth realms.

<text>The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of . The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the most massive living non-cetacean animal. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae, which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. Before 1984 it was classified as &quot;Rhiniodon&quot; into Rhinodontidae.

Whale sharks inhabit the open waters of all tropical oceans. They are rarely found in water below . Whale sharks&#x27; lifespans are estimated to be between 80 and 130 years, based on studies of their vertebral growth bands and the growth rates of free-swimming sharks. Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes, and do not pose any threat to humans.

The species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a specimen in Table Bay, South Africa. Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town, described it the following year. The name &quot;whale shark&quot; refers to the animal&#x27;s appearance and large size; it is a fish, not a mammal, and (like all sharks) is not closely related to whales.

==Description==
Whale sharks possess a broad, flattened head with a large mouth and two small eyes located at the front corners. Unlike many other sharks, whale shark mouths are located at the front of the head rather than on the underside of the head. A whale shark was reported to have a mouth across. Whale shark mouths can contain over 300 rows of tiny teeth and 20 filter pads which it uses to filter feed. The spiracles are located just behind the eyes. Whale sharks have five large pairs of gills. Their skin is dark grey with a white belly marked with an arrangement of pale grey or white spots and stripes that is unique to each individual. The skin can be up to thick and is very hard and rough to the touch. The whale shark has three prominent ridges along its sides, which start above and behind the head and end at the caudal peduncle. The shark has two dorsal fins set relatively far back on the body, a pair of pectoral fins, a pair of pelvic fins and a single medial anal fin. The caudal fin has a larger upper lobe than the lower lobe ().

Whale sharks have been found to possess dermal denticles on the surface of their eyeballs that are structured differently from their body denticles. The dermal denticles, as well as the whale shark&#x27;s ability to retract its eyes deep into their sockets, serve to protect the eyes from damage.

Evidence suggests that whale sharks can recover from major injuries and may be able to regenerate small sections of their fins. Their spot markings have also been shown to reform over a previously wounded area.

The complete and annotated genome of the whale shark was published in 2017.

Rhodopsin, the light-sensing pigment in the rod cells of the retina, is normally sensitive to green and used to see in dim light, but in the whale shark (and the bottom-dwelling cloudy catshark) two amino acid substitutions make the pigment more sensitive to blue light instead, the light that dominates the deep ocean. One of these mutations also makes rhodopsin vulnerable to higher temperatures. In humans, a similar mutation leads to congenital stationary night blindness, as the human body temperature makes the pigment decay. This pigment becomes unstable in shallow water, where the temperature is higher and the full spectrum of light is present. To protect from this instability, the whale shark deactivates the pigment when in shallow water (as otherwise the pigment would hinder full color vision). In the colder environment at 2,000 meters below the surface where the shark dives, it is activated again. The mutations thus allow the shark to see well at both ends of its great vertical range. The eyes have also lost all cone opsins except LWS.

=== Size ===
The whale shark is the largest non-cetacean animal in the world. However, the maximum size and growth patterns of the species are not well understood.

Limited evidence, mostly from males, suggests that sexual maturity occurs around in length, with the possibility of females sexually maturing at a similar size or larger.

Various studies have aimed to estimate the growth and longevity of whale sharks, either by analysing evidence from vertebral growth rings or measurements taken from re-sighted sharks over several years. This information is used to model growth curves, which can predict asymptotic length. The growth curves produced from these studies have estimated asymptotic lengths ranging from . 

A 2020 study looked at the growth of whale shark individuals over a 10-year period around the Ningaloo Reef and concluded the species exhibits sexual dimorphism with regard to size, with females growing larger than males. The study found that males on average reach in length. The same study had less female data but estimated an average length of around . However, this value dropped to if data from aquarium whale sharks was included. The authors noted that these estimates represent average asymptotic size and are not the maximum sizes possible. Additionally, they acknowledged the potential for regional size variation.

Most previous growth studies have had data predominately from males and none have data from sharks over ~. Not all previous studies created separate growth curves for males and females, instead combining data from both sexes. Those studies that made sex-specific growth curves have estimated large asymptotic length estimates for males, with lengths of or more. However, mostly immature males were available in these studies, with few adults to constrain the upper portion of the growth curves.

The largest total length for the species is uncertain due to a lack of detailed documentation of the largest reported individuals. Whale sharks as large as in length have been reported in scientific literature. However, most whale sharks observed are smaller.

Large whale sharks are difficult to measure accurately, both on the land and in the water. When on land, the total length measurement can be affected by how the tail is positioned, either angled as it would be in life or stretched as far as possible. Historically, techniques such as comparisons to objects of known size and knotted ropes have been used for in-water measurements, but these techniques may be inaccurate. Various forms of photogrammetry have been used to improve the accuracy of in-water measurements, including underwater and aerial techniques.

=== Reports of large whale sharks ===
Since the 1800s, there have been accounts of very large whale sharks. Some of these are as follows:

In 1868, the Irish natural scientist Edward Perceval Wright obtained several small whale shark specimens in the Seychelles. Wright was informed of one whale shark that was measured as exceeding . Wright claimed to have observed specimens over and was told of specimens upwards of .

Hugh M. Smith described a huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919. The shark was too heavy to pull ashore, and no measurements were taken. Smith learned through independent sources that it was at least 10 wa (a Thai unit of length measuring between a person&#x27;s outstretched arms). Smith noted that one wa could be interpreted as either or the approximate average of , based on the local fishermen. Later sources have stated this whale shark as approximately , but the accuracy of the estimate has been questioned.

In 1934, a ship named the &quot;Maunganui&quot; came across a whale shark in the southern Pacific Ocean and rammed it. The shark became stuck on the prow of the ship, supposedly with on one side and on the other, suggesting a total length of about .

Scott A. Eckert &amp; Brent S. Stewart reported on satellite tracking of whale sharks from 1994 to 1996. Out of the 15 individuals tracked, two females were reported as measuring and . A long whale shark was reported as being stranded along the Ratnagiri coast in 1995. A female individual with a standard length of and an estimated total length at was reported from the Arabian Sea in 2001. In a 2015 study reviewing the size of marine megafauna, McClain and colleagues considered this female as being the most reliable and accurately measured.

On 7 February 2012, a large whale shark was found floating off the coast of Karachi, Pakistan. The length of the specimen was said to be between , with a weight of around .

==Distribution and habitat==
The whale shark inhabits all tropical and warm-temperate seas. The fish is primarily pelagic, and can be found in both coastal and oceanic habitats. Tracking devices have shown that the whale shark displays dynamic patterns of habitat utilization, likely in response to availability of prey. Whale sharks observed off the northeast Yucatan Peninsula tend to engage in inshore surface swimming between sunrise and mid-afternoon, followed by regular vertical oscillations in oceanic waters during the afternoon and overnight. About 95% of the oscillating period was spent in epipelagic depths (&lt;), but whale sharks also took regular deep dives (&gt;), often descending in brief &quot;stutter steps&quot;, perhaps for foraging. The deepest recorded dive was . Whale sharks were also observed to remain continuously at depths of greater than for three days or more.

The whale shark is migratory and has two distinct subpopulations: an Atlantic subpopulation, from Maine and the Azores to Cape Agulhas, South Africa, and an Indo-Pacific subpopulation which holds 75% of the entire whale shark population. It usually roams between 30°N and 35°S where water temperatures are higher than but have been spotted as far north as the Bay of Fundy, Canada and the Sea of Okhotsk north of Japan and as far south as Victoria, Australia.

Seasonal feeding aggregations occur at several coastal sites such as the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia, Darwin Island in the Galápagos, Quintana Roo in Mexico, Mafia Island of Pwani Region in Tanzania, Inhambane province in Mozambique, the Philippines, around Mahe in the Seychelles, the Gujarat and Kerala coasts of India, Taiwan, southern China and Qatar.

In 2011, more than 400 whale sharks gathered off the Yucatan Coast. It was one of the largest gatherings of whale sharks recorded. Aggregations in that area are among the most reliable seasonal gatherings known for whale sharks, with large numbers occurring in most years between May and September. Associated ecotourism has grown rapidly to unsustainable levels.

==Growth and reproduction==
Growth, longevity, and reproduction of the whale shark are poorly understood. 

Vertebral growth bands have been used to estimate the age, growth, and longevity of whale sharks. However, there was uncertainty as to whether vertebrae growth bands are formed annually or biannually. A 2020 study compared the ratio of Carbon-14 isotopes found in growth bands of whale shark vertebrae to nuclear testing events in the 1950–60s, finding that growth bands are laid down annually. The study found an age of 50 years for a female and 35 years for a male. Various studies looking at vertebrae growth bands and measuring whale sharks in the wild have estimated their lifespans from ~80 years and up to ~130 years.

Evidence suggests that males grow faster than females in the earlier stages of life but ultimately reach a smaller maximum size. Whale sharks exhibit late sexual maturity. One study looking at free-swimming whale sharks estimated the age at maturity in males at ~25 years.

Pupping of whale sharks has not been observed, but mating has been witnessed twice in St Helena. Mating in this species was filmed for the first time in whale sharks off Ningaloo Reef via airplane in Australia in 2019, when a larger male unsuccessfully attempted to mate with a smaller, immature female.

The capture of a ~ female in July 1996 that was pregnant with ~300 pups indicated that whale sharks are ovoviviparous. The eggs remain in the body and the females give birth to live young which are long. Evidence indicates the pups are not all born at once, but rather the female retains sperm from one mating and produces a steady stream of pups over a prolonged period.

On 7 March 2009, marine scientists in the Philippines discovered what is believed to be the smallest living specimen of the whale shark. The young shark, measuring only , was found with its tail tied to a stake at a beach in Pilar, Sorsogon, Philippines, and was released into the wild. Based on this discovery, some scientists no longer believe this area is just a feeding ground; this site may be a birthing ground, as well. Both young whale sharks and pregnant females have been seen in the waters of St Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, where numerous whale sharks can be spotted during the summer.

In a report from Rappler last August 2019, whale sharks were sighted during WWF Philippines&#x27; photo identification activities in the first half of the year. There were a total 168 sightings – 64 of them &quot;re-sightings&quot; or reappearances of previously recorded whale sharks. WWF noted that &quot;very young whale shark juveniles&quot; were identified among the 168 individuals spotted in the first half of 2019. Their presence suggests that the Ticao Pass may be a pupping ground for whale sharks, further increasing the ecological significance of the area.

Large adult females, often pregnant, are a seasonal presence around the Galapagos Islands, which may have reproductive significance. One study between 2011 and 2013 found that 91.5% of the whale sharks observed around Darwin Island were adult females.

==Diet==

The whale shark is a filter feeder – one of only three known filter-feeding shark species (along with the basking shark and the megamouth shark). It feeds on plankton including copepods, krill, fish eggs, Christmas Island red crab larvae and small nektonic life, such as small squid or fish. It also feeds on clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals. The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding. Feeding occurs either by ram filtration, in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward, pushing water and food into the mouth, or by active suction feeding, in which the animal opens and closes its mouth, sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills. In both cases, the filter pads serve to separate food from water. These unique, black sieve-like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers. Food separation in whale sharks is by cross-flow filtration, in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface, not perpendicularly through it, before passing to the outside, while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat. This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimizes fouling of the filter pad surface. Whale sharks have been observed &quot;coughing&quot;, presumably to clear a build-up of particles from the filter pads. Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed.

The whale shark is an active feeder, targeting concentrations of plankton or fish. It is able to ram filter feed or can gulp in a stationary position. This is in contrast to the passive feeding basking shark, which does not pump water. Instead, it swims to force water across its gills.

A juvenile whale shark is estimated to eat 21 kg (46 pounds) of plankton per day.

The BBC program &quot;Planet Earth&quot; filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish. The same documentary showed footage of a whale shark timing its arrival to coincide with the mass spawning of fish shoals and feeding on the resultant clouds of eggs and sperm.

Due their mode of feeding, whale sharks are susceptible to the ingestion of microplastics. As such, the presence of microplastics in whale shark scat was recently confirmed.

==Relationship with humans==
===Behavior toward divers===

Despite its size, the whale shark does not pose any danger to humans. Younger whale sharks are gentle and can play with divers. Underwater photographers such as Fiona Ayerst have photographed them swimming close to humans without any danger. Although whale sharks are docile fish, touching or riding the sharks is strictly forbidden and fineable in most countries, as it can cause serious harm to the animal. 
The shark is seen by divers in many places, including the Bay Islands in Honduras, Thailand, Indonesia (Bone Bolango, Cendrawasih Bay), the Philippines, the Maldives close to Maamigili (South Ari Atoll), the Red Sea, Western Australia (Ningaloo Reef, Christmas Island), Taiwan, Panama (Coiba Island), Belize, Tofo Beach in Mozambique, Sodwana Bay (Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park) in South Africa, the Galapagos Islands, Saint Helena, Isla Mujeres (Caribbean Sea), La Paz, Baja California Sur and Bahía de los Ángeles in Mexico, the Seychelles, West Malaysia, islands off eastern peninsular Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Oman, Fujairah, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the Caribbean. Juveniles can be found near the shore in the Gulf of Tadjoura, near Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa.

===Conservation status===
There is currently no robust estimate of the global whale shark population. The species is considered endangered by the IUCN due to the impacts of fisheries, by-catch losses, and vessel strikes, combined with its long lifespan and late maturation. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the whale shark as &quot;Migrant&quot; with the qualifier &quot;Secure Overseas&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

It is listed, along with six other species of sharks, under the CMS Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. In 1998, the Philippines banned all fishing, selling, importing, and exporting of whale sharks for commercial purposes, followed by India in May 2001 and Taiwan in May 2007.

In 2010, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill resulted in of oil flowing into an area south of the Mississippi River Delta, where one-third of all whale shark sightings in the northern part of the gulf have occurred in recent years. Sightings confirmed that the whale sharks were unable to avoid the oil slick, which was situated on the surface of the sea where the whale sharks feed for several hours at a time. No dead whale sharks were found.

This species was also added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2003 to regulate the international trade of live specimens and its parts.

It was reported in 2014 that hundreds of whale sharks were illegally killed every year in China for their fins, skins, and oil.

===In captivity===
The whale shark is popular in the few public aquariums that keep it, but its large size means that a very large tank is required and it has specialized feeding requirements. Their large size and iconic status have also fueled an opposition to keeping the species in captivity, especially after the early death of some whale sharks in captivity and certain Chinese aquariums keeping the species in relatively small tanks.
The first attempt at keeping whale sharks in captivity was in 1934 when an individual was kept for about four months in a netted-off natural bay in Izu, Japan. The first attempt of keeping whale sharks in an aquarium was initiated in 1980 by the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium (then known as Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium) in Japan. Since 1980, several have been kept at Okinawa, mostly obtained from incidental catches in coastal nets set by fishers (none after 2009), but two were strandings. Several of these were already weak from the capture/stranding and some were released, but initial captive survival rates were low. After the initial difficulties in maintaining the species had been resolved, some have survived long-term in captivity. The record for a whale shark in captivity is an individual that, as of 2021, has lived for more than 26 years in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium from Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium. Following Okinawa, Osaka Aquarium started keeping whale sharks and most of the basic research on the keeping of the species was made at these two institutions.

Since the mid-1990s, several other aquariums have kept the species in Japan (Kagoshima Aquarium, Kinosaki Marine World, Notojima Aquarium, Oita Marine Palace Aquarium, and Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise), South Korea (Aqua Planet Jeju), China (Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, Dalian Aquarium, Guangzhou Aquarium in Guangzhou Zoo, Qingdao Polar Ocean World and Yantai Aquarium), Taiwan (National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium), India (Thiruvananthapuram Aquarium) and Dubai (Atlantis, The Palm), with some maintaining whale sharks for years and others only for a very short period. The whale shark kept at Dubai&#x27;s Atlantis, The Palm was rescued from shallow waters in 2008 with extensive abrasions to the fins and after rehabilitation it was released in 2010, having lived 19 months in captivity. Marine Life Park in Singapore had planned on keeping whale sharks but scrapped this idea in 2009.

Outside Asia, the first and so far only place to keep whale sharks is Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, United States. This is unusual because of the comparatively long transport time and complex logistics required to bring the sharks to the aquarium, ranging between 28 and 36 hours. Georgia keeps two whale sharks: two males, Taroko and Yushan, who both arrived in 2007. Two earlier males at Georgia Aquarium, Ralph and Norton, both died in 2007. Trixie died in 2020. Alice died in 2021. Georgia&#x27;s whale sharks were all imported from Taiwan and were taken from the commercial fishing quota for the species, usually used locally for food. Taiwan closed this fishery entirely in 2008.

===Human culture===

In Madagascar, whale sharks are called in Malagasy, meaning &quot;many stars&quot;, after the appearance of the markings on the shark&#x27;s back.

In the Philippines, it is called and . The whale shark is featured on the reverse of the Philippine 100-peso bill. By law snorkelers must maintain a distance of from the sharks and there is a fine and possible prison sentence for anyone who touches the animals.

Whale sharks are also known as in Japan (because the markings resemble patterns typically seen on ); (roughly &quot;star from the East&quot;) in Indonesia; and (literally &quot;sir fish&quot;) in Vietnam.

The whale shark is also featured on the latest 2015–2017 edition of the Maldivian 1000 rufiyaa banknote, along with the green turtle.

<text>Michael Gwyl Bevan (born 8 May 1970) is an Australian former international cricketer. He played as a left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm wrist spin bowler. For several years, he was considered the world&#x27;s finest One Day International batsman, and topped the International Cricket Council&#x27;s batting rankings in the format on numerous occasions. He was the first Canberra-born player to represent Australia at international level. He played 232 ODIs for Australia, and was a part of the Australian squads which won the 1999 and 2003 Cricket World Cups. He represented Australia at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, where cricket was included in the Games for the first time.

Bevan was an Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1989. He scored a total of 15,103 runs in List A cricket at an average of 57.86 runs per innings. This is the highest batting average for any player who has batted in 50 or more innings. In 2007 he was named in Australia&#x27;s greatest ODI team, while in 2025, he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. The Michael Bevan Medal, for the player of the match in the Australian Domestic One-Day Cricket Final, is named after him.

==Playing career==
Michael Bevan&#x27;s first senior club was Weston Creek Cricket Club in Canberra. He made his first-class debut during the 1989-90 domestic season for South Australia, scoring a century on debut against Western Australia.

After a single season with South Australia, Bevan moved to play for New South Wales, where he spent the majority of his career. He played in English County Cricket for Yorkshire, Leicestershire, Sussex and Kent County Cricket Clubs. After 14 seasons, he moved to play for Tasmania ahead of the 2004–05 season Sheffield Shield season, scoring a then-record 1,464 first-class runs in the season. He retired from cricket at the end of the 2006–07 season.

===ODI career===

He made his ODI debut on 14 April 1994 against Sri Lanka in the 1994 Austral-Asia Cup at Sharjah and was not required to bat as Australia chased down 155 comfortably with nine wickets to spare. By the 1995–96 season, he became a regular in the side. He proved a reliable anchor at the bottom of the middle order, and he would often patiently guide Australia to victory following a rare top-order collapse – leading to him being nicknamed &quot;The Finisher&quot;. By the end of his ODI career, Bevan was known as the &quot;Pyjama Picasso&quot;. During his ODI career, he managed to hit just 21 sixes in 232 ODI matches. He batted 45 times in successful ODI run chases for Australia and out of those 45 outings, he remained unbeaten at the crease on 25 occasions.

One of his most famous &quot;anchor&quot; innings was in the New Year&#x27;s Day One Day International at the Sydney Cricket Ground against the West Indies in 1996 during the Benson &amp; Hedges World Series. With the Australians at one stage 6/38 chasing 173, his unbeaten 150-minute 78 got the Australians over the line with a four on the last ball of the innings. He was the second leading run scorer in the 1995/96 Benson &amp; Hedges World Series only behind Mark Taylor with an aggregate of 389 runs in 10 innings at an average of 194.50, bolstered by eight not-outs in his 10 innings.

He featured in his first World Cup tournament during the 1996 Cricket World Cup and played a crucial role to help Australia to reach the final of the tournament by scoring 69 runs in the semi-final clash against the West Indies, a match which is highly remembered and known due to the dramatic collapse of the West Indies in a low scoring run chase of 208. He also played an important cameo of unbeaten 36 off 49 balls in the 1996 World Cup final which propelled Australia to a decent total of 241/7 on the board. However, his efforts went in vain as Sri Lanka chased down 242 to win their maiden World Cup title.

He was selected to the Australian squad for the 50 over cricket tournament at the 1998 Commonwealth Games where Australia became runners-up in the competition to South Africa. He was a key member of the Australian side which lifted the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

On 8 April 2000, he played arguably the best knock of his career where he steered the mammoth epic run chase of 321 by scoring an unbeaten 185 off just 132 deliveries in an unofficial ODI held in Dhaka which almost guaranteed Rest of the World XI for an unlikely victory against the Asia XI. Rest of the World XI at one stage were reeling at 7/196 in the 37th over and was staring at a big defeat before Bevan came to the rescue who smashed 19 fours and five sixes to provide a glimmer of hope. He alongside Andy Caddick put on a 119 run partnership for the eighth wicket which led to a great recovery for the chasing side. However, Rest of the World XI lost by just one run in the end despite the heroics of Bevan. Caddick was involved in a brainfade moment in the critical juncture of the match as he was run out on the penultimate delivery effectively denying Rest of the World XI a famous win given the circumstances on how the game had panned out. However, his knock of 185 not out could not be realised as Bevan&#x27;s highest ODI or even List A score due to the fact that the match did not have any status as it was deemed as an unofficial ODI meaning the match does not even count as a List A match.

In January 2002, he scored a crucial unbeaten 95 ball 102 in a match against New Zealand in a modest run chase of 246 at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. He arrived to the crease as he once again had to do the bulk of scoring runs after all familiar Aussie top-order collapse as Australia were reeling at 82/6 at one point to then reduced to 143/7. His knock guaranteed Australia a thrilling two wicket win over New Zealand with three balls to spare.

Bevan entered the 2003 Cricket World Cup injured. He played his first game in the group stage against India. He didn&#x27;t bat until the fifth group game against Namibia and he registered a rusty 17 before being caught and bowled by Louis Burger. In the final group game against England, he came in with Australia struggling at 48–4. He then was joined by Andy Bichel at 135–8 with 70 runs still required to win. Bevan finished on 74 not out and Bichel 34 not out as Australia won in the final over. An unbeaten group stage was followed by an unbeaten Super Six stage. He made 56 against New Zealand helping Australia recover from 84–7 again batting with Bichel to help Australia win. His last knock was an unfortunate golden duck in the semi-final against Sri Lanka and he was not required to bat in the final which Australia won.

===Test career===

Despite his ODI success, Bevan&#x27;s Test career was not nearly as successful. Thought to be susceptible to short-pitched deliveries, he had limited success as a Test batsman, with an average of only 29. He ended up his topsy-turvy Test career without a career century to his name. However he scored heavily in domestic first-class cricket for New South Wales, averaging almost 60 with the bat. He performed well during his limited time as a bowler in Test matches, with his bowling style of left-arm unorthodox spin, which included taking ten wickets in a Test match against the West Indies at the Adelaide Oval.

The retirement of Allan Border opened doors for his arrival to international cricket. He made his Test debut against Pakistan on 28 September 1994 as the 360th Test cap for Australia. He had a promising start to his Test career scoring 82 batting at no 5 on his debut in Australia&#x27;s first innings and just fell short of 18 runs which would have brought him in an elite list of Test centurions on debut. He continued his momentum in his debut Test series which was against Pakistan by making two more half-centuries. During the Test series against the West Indies in 1997-98, he showed his all-round prowess both with the bat and ball scoring two unbeaten 80s when batting down the order and often ran out of partners during the course of those knocks while also picking up 15 wickets.

He admitted that the reason why his Test career never really took off is mainly due to the psychological reasons and not the technical reasons.

===Retirement===
On 17 January 2007, due to injuries Bevan announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. &quot;It got to the stage where injuries and pain were holding back my motivation, and it got to the stage where I was finding it hard to get up for matches and that was probably a pretty clear indication that it was time to move on,&quot; Bevan said.

==Post-playing career==
===Coaching===
Apart from coaching the Chennai Superstars in the Indian Cricket League, Bevan participated in the Beach Cricket Tri-Nations series for Australia. In January 2011, Bevan was announced the coach for Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab.

===Television===
In 2020, Bevan was revealed to be the &#x27;Hammerhead&#x27; in the second season of &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot; and was the second contestant eliminated, placing 11th overall.

===Professional career===
Bevan later started a mortgage broking franchise and features on the Australian speaking circuit.

<text>Howard Engel CM (April 2, 1931 – July 16, 2019) was a Canadian mystery author and CBC producer who resided in Toronto, Ontario. He was famous for his Benny Cooperman detective series, set in the Niagara Region in and around the city of Grantham, Ontario, mirroring St. Catharines, Ontario, where he was born. He was one of the founding authors of Crime Writers of Canada in 1982.

==Personal life==
From 1962 to 1978 he was married to Marian Engel, a noted Canadian author of literary fiction, who died in 1985. They had two children, twins Charlotte and William, born in 1965. Charlotte currently is an independent television producer. Engel married Canadian novelist Janet Hamilton. The couple have one son, Jacob Engel, born in 1989.

In 2001, he unknowingly suffered a stroke that left him with alexia sine agraphia, a condition that prevented him from understanding written words without a major effort without affecting his ability to write. He was later able to write a new novel, &quot;Memory Book&quot; (2005), in which his character Benny Cooperman suffers a blow to the head and is similarly affected. He later published &quot;The Man Who Forgot How To Read&quot; (2007), a memoir of the time he spent recovering from the stroke, with an afterword by Oliver Sacks (who wrote about Engel&#x27;s reading problems in the book &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;), and another novel, &quot;East of Suez&quot;, in 2008.

In February 2007, Engel was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada, receiving it at the 100th investiture. In 2013, Engel received a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee medal. He died in Toronto on July 16, 2019, of pneumonia that arose from a stroke, at the age of 88.

<doc id="284925" wikidata="Q193705" url="?curid=284925" title="The Nutcracker">
<text>The Nutcracker (, ), Op. 71, is an 1892 two-act classical ballet (conceived as a &quot;&quot;; ) by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, set on Christmas Eve at the foot of a Christmas tree in a child&#x27;s imagination featuring a Nutcracker doll. The plot is an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; 1844 short story &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, itself a retelling of E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s 1816 short story &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot;. The ballet&#x27;s first choreographer was Marius Petipa, with whom Tchaikovsky had worked three years earlier on &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, assisted by Lev Ivanov. Although the complete and staged &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; ballet was not initially as successful as the 20-minute &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; that Tchaikovsky had premiered nine months earlier, it became popular in later years.

Since the late 1960s, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; has been danced by many ballet companies, especially in North America. Major American ballet companies generate around 40% of their annual ticket revenues from performances of the ballet. Its score has been used in several film adaptations of Hoffmann&#x27;s story.

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score has become one of his most famous compositions. Among other things, the score is noted for its use of the celesta, an instrument the composer had already employed in his much lesser known symphonic ballad &quot;The Voyevoda&quot; (1891).

==Composition==
After the success of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; in 1890, Ivan Vsevolozhsky, the director of the Imperial Theatres, commissioned Tchaikovsky to compose a double-bill program featuring both an opera and a ballet. The opera would be &quot;Iolanta&quot;. For the ballet, Tchaikovsky would again join forces with Marius Petipa, with whom he had collaborated on &quot;The Sleeping Beauty.&quot; The material Vsevolozhsky chose was an adaptation of E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s story &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot;, by Alexandre Dumas called &quot;The Story of a Nutcracker&quot;. The plot of Hoffmann&#x27;s story (and Dumas&#x27; adaptation) was greatly simplified for the two-act ballet. Hoffmann&#x27;s tale contains a long flashback story within its main plot titled &quot;The Tale of the Hard Nut&quot;, which explains how the Prince was turned into the Nutcracker. This had to be excised for the ballet.

Petipa gave Tchaikovsky extremely detailed instructions for the composition of each number, down to the tempo and number of bars. The completion of the work was interrupted for a short time when Tchaikovsky visited the United States for twenty-five days to conduct concerts for the opening of Carnegie Hall. Tchaikovsky composed parts of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in Rouen, France.

==History==
===Saint Petersburg premiere===

The first performance of the ballet was held as a double premiere together with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s last opera, &quot;Iolanta&quot;, on , at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Although the libretto was by Marius Petipa, who exactly choreographed the first production has been debated. Petipa began work on the choreography in August 1892; however, illness removed him from its completion and his assistant of seven years, Lev Ivanov, was brought in. Although Ivanov is often credited as the choreographer, some contemporary accounts credit Petipa. The performance was conducted by Italian composer Riccardo Drigo, with Antonietta Dell&#x27;Era as the Sugar Plum Fairy, Pavel Gerdt as Prince Coqueluche, Stanislava Belinskaya as Clara, Sergei Legat as the Nutcracker-Prince, and Timofey Stukolkin as Drosselmeyer. Unlike in many later productions, the children&#x27;s roles were performed by real children – students of the Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg, with Belinskaya as Clara, and Vassily Stukolkin as Fritz – rather than adults.

The first performance of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; was not deemed a success. The reaction to the dancers themselves was ambivalent. Although some critics praised Dell&#x27;Era on her pointework as the Sugar Plum Fairy (she allegedly received five curtain-calls), one critic called her &quot;corpulent&quot; and &quot;podgy&quot;. Olga Preobrajenskaya as the Columbine doll was panned by one critic as &quot;completely insipid&quot; and praised as &quot;charming&quot; by another.

Alexandre Benois described the choreography of the battle scene as confusing: &quot;One can not understand anything. Disorderly pushing about from corner to corner and running backwards and forwards – quite amateurish.&quot;

The libretto was criticized as &quot;lopsided&quot; and for not being faithful to the Hoffmann tale. Much of the criticism focused on the featuring of children so prominently in the ballet, and many bemoaned the fact that the ballerina did not dance until the &quot;Grand Pas de Deux&quot; near the end of the second act (which did not occur until nearly midnight during the program). Some found the transition between the mundane world of the first scene and the fantasy world of the second act too abrupt. Reception was better for Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score. Some critics called it &quot;astonishingly rich in detailed inspiration&quot; and &quot;from beginning to end, beautiful, melodious, original, and characteristic&quot;. But this also was not unanimous, as some critics found the party scene &quot;ponderous&quot; and the &quot;Grand Pas de Deux&quot; &quot;insipid&quot;.

===Subsequent productions===

In 1919, choreographer Alexander Gorsky staged a production which eliminated the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier and gave their dances to Clara and the Nutcracker Prince, who were played by adults instead of children. This was the first production to do so. An abridged version of the ballet was first performed outside Russia in Budapest (Royal Opera House) in 1927, with choreography by Ede Brada. In 1934, choreographer Vasili Vainonen staged a version of the work that addressed many of the criticisms of the original 1892 production by casting adult dancers in the roles of Clara and the Prince, as Gorsky had. The Vainonen version influenced several later productions.

The first complete performance outside Russia took place in England in 1934, staged by Nicholas Sergeyev after Petipa&#x27;s original choreography. Annual performances of the ballet have been staged there since 1952. Another abridged version of the ballet, performed by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staged in New York City in 1940, Alexandra Fedorova – again, after Petipa&#x27;s version. The ballet&#x27;s first complete United States performance was on 24 December 1944 by the San Francisco Ballet, staged by its artistic director, Willam Christensen, and starring Gisella Caccialanza as the Sugar Plum Fairy, and Jocelyn Vollmar as the Snow Queen. After the enormous success of this production, San Francisco Ballet has presented &quot;Nutcracker&quot; every Christmas Eve and throughout the winter season, debuting new productions in 1944, 1954, 1967, and 2004. The original Christensen version continues in Salt Lake City, where Christensen relocated in 1948. It has been performed every year since 1963 by the Christensen-founded Ballet West.

The New York City Ballet gave its first annual performance of George Balanchine&#x27;s reworked staging of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in 1954. The performance of Maria Tallchief in the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy helped elevate the work from obscurity into an annual Christmas classic and the industry&#x27;s most reliable box-office draw. Critic Walter Terry remarked that &quot;Maria Tallchief, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, is herself a creature of magic, dancing the seemingly impossible with effortless beauty of movement, electrifying us with her brilliance, enchanting us with her radiance of being. Does she have any equals anywhere, inside or outside of fairyland? While watching her in &quot;The Nutcracker,&quot; one is tempted to doubt it.&quot;

Since Gorsky, Vainonen and Balanchine&#x27;s productions, many other choreographers have made their own versions. Some institute the changes made by Gorsky and Vainonen while others, like Balanchine, utilize the original libretto. Some notable productions include Rudolf Nureyev&#x27;s 1963 production for the Royal Ballet, Yury Grigorovich for the Bolshoi Ballet, Mikhail Baryshnikov for the American Ballet Theatre, Fernand Nault for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens starting in 1964, Kent Stowell for Pacific Northwest Ballet starting in 1983, and Peter Wright for the Royal Ballet and the Birmingham Royal Ballet. In recent years, revisionist productions, including those by Mark Morris, Matthew Bourne, and Mikhail Chemiakin have appeared; these depart radically from both the original 1892 libretto and Vainonen&#x27;s revival, while Maurice Béjart&#x27;s version completely discards the original plot and characters. In addition to annual live stagings of the work, many productions have also been televised or released on home video.

==Roles==
The following extrapolation of the characters (in order of appearance) is drawn from an examination of the stage directions in the score.

===Act I===
===Act II===

==Plot ==
Below is a synopsis based on the original 1892 libretto by Marius Petipa. The story varies from production to production, though most follow the basic outline. The names of the characters also vary. In the original Hoffmann story, the young heroine is called Marie Stahlbaum and Clara (Klärchen) is her doll&#x27;s name. In the adaptation by Dumas on which Petipa based his libretto, her name is Marie Silberhaus. In still other productions, such as Balanchine&#x27;s, Clara is Marie Stahlbaum rather than Clara Silberhaus.

=== Act I ===
Scene 1: The Stahlbaum Home
 In Nuremberg, Germany on Christmas Eve in the 1820s, a family and their friends gather in the parlor to decorate the Christmas tree in preparation for the party. Once the tree is finished, the children are summoned.

When the party begins, presents are given out to the children. When the owl-topped grandfather clock strikes eight, a mysterious figure enters the room. It is Drosselmeyer—a councilman, magician, and Clara&#x27;s godfather. He is also a talented toymaker who has brought with him gifts for the children, including four lifelike dolls who dance to the delight of all. He then has them put away for safekeeping.

Clara and her brother Fritz are sad to see the dolls being taken away, but Drosselmeyer has yet another toy for them: a wooden nutcracker doll, which the other children ignore. Clara immediately takes a liking to it, but Fritz accidentally breaks it. Clara is heartbroken, but Drosselmeyer fixes the nutcracker, much to everyone&#x27;s relief.

During the night, after everyone else has gone to bed, Clara returns to the parlor to check on the nutcracker. As she reaches the small bed, the clock strikes midnight and she looks up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself in the midst of a battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king.

The nutcracker appears to lead the gingerbread men, who are joined by tin soldiers, and by dolls who serve as doctors to carry away the wounded. As the seven-headed Mouse King advances on the still-wounded nutcracker, Clara throws her slipper at him, distracting him long enough for the nutcracker to stab him.

Scene 2: A Pine Forest

The mice retreat and the nutcracker is transformed into a human prince. He leads Clara through the moonlit night to a pine forest in which the snowflakes dance around them, beckoning them on to his kingdom as the first act ends.

=== Act II ===
The Land of Sweets

Clara and the Prince travel to the beautiful Land of Sweets, ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy in the Prince&#x27;s place until his return. He recounts for her how he had been saved from the Mouse King by Clara and transformed back into himself.
In honor of the young heroine, a celebration of sweets from around the world is produced: chocolate from Spain, coffee from Arabia, tea from China, and candy canes from Russia all dance for their amusement; Marzipan shepherdesses perform on their flutes; Mother Ginger has her children, the Polichinelles, emerge from under her enormous hoop skirt to dance; a string of beautiful flowers performs a waltz. To conclude the night, the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier perform a dance.

A final waltz is performed by all the sweets, after which the Sugar Plum Fairy ushers Clara and the Prince down from their throne. He bows to her, she kisses Clara goodbye, and leads them to a reindeer-drawn sleigh. It takes off as they wave goodbye to all the subjects who wave back.

In the original libretto, the ballet&#x27;s apotheosis &quot;represents a large beehive with flying bees, closely guarding their riches&quot;. Just like &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, there have been various alternative endings created in productions subsequent to the original.

==Musical sources and influences==
&quot;The Nutcracker&quot; is one of the composer&#x27;s most popular compositions. The music belongs to the Romantic period and contains some of his most memorable melodies, several of which are frequently used in television and film. (They are often heard in TV commercials shown during the Christmas season.)

Tchaikovsky is said to have argued with a friend who wagered that the composer could not write a melody based on a one-octave scale in sequence. Tchaikovsky asked if it mattered whether the notes were in ascending or descending order and was assured it did not. This resulted in the Adagio from the , which, in the ballet, nearly always immediately follows the &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot;. A story is also told that Tchaikovsky&#x27;s sister Alexandra (9 January 1842 — 9 April 1891) had died shortly before he began composition of the ballet and that his sister&#x27;s death influenced him to compose a melancholy, descending scale melody for the adagio of the Grand Pas de Deux. However, it is more naturally perceived as a dreams-come-true theme because of another celebrated scale use, the ascending one in the &quot;Barcarolle&quot; from &quot;The Seasons&quot;.

Tchaikovsky was less satisfied with &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; than with &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;. (In the film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, commentator Deems Taylor observes that he &quot;really detested&quot; the score.) Tchaikovsky accepted the commission from Vsevolozhsky but did not particularly want to write the ballet (though he did write to a friend while composing it, &quot;I am daily becoming more and more attuned to my task&quot;).

==Concert excerpts and arrangements==

===Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a===

Tchaikovsky made a selection of eight of the numbers from the ballet before the ballet&#x27;s December 1892 première, forming &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;, Op. 71a, intended for concert performance. The suite was first performed, under the composer&#x27;s direction, on 19 March 1892 at an assembly of the Saint Petersburg branch of the Musical Society. The suite became instantly popular, with almost every number encored at its premiere, while the complete ballet did not begin to achieve its great popularity until after the George Balanchine staging became a hit in New York City. The suite became very popular on the concert stage, and was excerpted in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;, omitting the two movements prior to the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. The outline below represents the selection and sequence of the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; made by the composer:

===Grainger: &quot;Paraphrase on Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Flower Waltz&quot;, for solo piano===
The &quot;Paraphrase on Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Flower Waltz&quot; is a successful piano arrangement from one of the movements from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; by the pianist and composer Percy Grainger.

===Pletnev: Concert suite from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, for solo piano===
The pianist and conductor Mikhail Pletnev adapted some of the music into a virtuosic concert suite for piano solo:
===Contemporary arrangements===
* In 1942, Freddy Martin and his orchestra recorded &quot;The Nutcracker Suite for Dance Orchestra&quot; on a set of 4 10-inch 78-RPM records issued by RCA Victor. An arrangement of the suite that lay between dance music and jazz.
* In 1947, Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians recorded &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; on a two-part Decca Records 12-inch 78 RPM record with one part on each side as Decca DU 90022, packaged in a picture sleeve. This version had custom lyrics written for Waring&#x27;s chorus by, among others, Waring himself. The arrangements were by Harry Simeone.
* In 1952, the Les Brown big band recorded a version of the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;, arranged by Frank Comstock, for Coral Records. Brown rerecorded the arrangement in stereo for his 1958 Capitol Records album &quot;Concert Modern&quot;.
* In 1960, Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn composed jazz interpretations of pieces from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score, recorded and released on LP as &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;. In 1999, this suite was supplemented with additional arrangements from the score by David Berger for &quot;The Harlem Nutcracker&quot;, a production of the ballet by choreographer Donald Byrd (born 1949) set during the Harlem Renaissance.
* In 1960, Shorty Rogers released &quot;The Swingin&#x27; Nutcracker&quot;, featuring jazz interpretations of pieces from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s score.
* In 1962, American poet and humorist Ogden Nash wrote verses inspired by the ballet, and these verses have sometimes been performed in concert versions of the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;. It has been recorded with Peter Ustinov reciting the verses, and the music is unchanged from the original.
* In 1962 a novelty boogie piano arrangement of the &quot;Marche&quot;, titled &quot;Nut Rocker&quot;, was a No. 1 single in the UK, and No. 21 in the US. Credited to B. Bumble and the Stingers, it was produced by Kim Fowley and featured studio musicians Al Hazan (piano), Earl Palmer (drums), Tommy Tedesco (guitar) and Red Callender (bass). &quot;Nut Rocker&quot; has subsequently been covered by many others including The Shadows, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, The Ventures, Dropkick Murphys, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. The Ventures&#x27; own instrumental rock cover of &quot;Nut Rocker&quot;, known as &quot;Nutty&quot;, is commonly connected to the NHL team, the Boston Bruins, from being used as the theme for the Bruins&#x27; telecast games for over two decades, from the late 1960s. In 2004, The Invincible Czars arranged, recorded, and now annually perform the entire suite for rock band.
* The Trans-Siberian Orchestra&#x27;s first album, &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot;, includes an instrumental piece titled &quot;A Mad Russian&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, which is a rock version of music from &quot;The Nutcracker.&quot;
* On the other end of the scale is the comedic version by Spike Jones and his City Slickers released by RCA Victor in December 1945 as &quot;Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies: The Nutcracker Suite (With Apologies to Tchaikovsky)&quot;, featuring humorous lyrics by Foster Carling and additional music by Joe &quot;Country&quot; Washburne. An abridged and resequenced version of this recording was issued in 1971 on the LP album &quot;Spike Jones is Murdering the Classics&quot;, one of the rare comedic pop records to be issued on the prestigious RCA Red Seal label.
* International choreographer Val Caniparoli has created several versions of The Nutcracker ballet for Louisville Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Royal New Zealand Ballet, and Grand Rapids Ballet. While his ballets remain classically rooted, he has contemporarized them with changes such as making Marie an adult instead of a child, or having Drosselmeir emerges through the clock face during the overture making &quot;him more humorous and mischievous.&quot; Caniparoli has been influenced by his simultaneous career as a dancer, having joined San Francisco Ballet in 1971 and performing as Drosselmeir and other various Nutcracker roles ever since that time.
* The Disco Biscuits, a trance-fusion jam band from Philadelphia, have performed &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; and &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; on multiple occasions.
* The Los Angeles Guitar Quartet (LAGQ) recorded the Suite arranged for four acoustic guitars on their CD recording &quot;Dances from Renaissance to Nutcracker&quot; (1992, Delos).
* In 1993, guitarist Tim Sparks recorded his arrangements for acoustic guitar on &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;.
* The Shirim Klezmer Orchestra released a klezmer version, titled &quot;Klezmer Nutcracker&quot;, in 1998 on the Newport label. The album became the basis for a December 2008 production by Ellen Kushner, titled &quot;The Klezmer Nutcracker&quot; and staged off-Broadway in New York City.
* In 2002, The Constructus Corporation used the melody of &quot;Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; for their track &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;.
* In 2009, Pet Shop Boys used a melody from &quot;March&quot; for their track &quot;All Over the World&quot;, taken from their album &quot;Yes&quot;.
* In 2012, jazz pianist Eyran Katsenelenbogen released his renditions of &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Reed Flutes&quot;, &quot;Russian Dance&quot; and &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; from the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;.
* In 2014, Pentatonix released an a cappella arrangement of &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; on the holiday album &quot;That&#x27;s Christmas to Me&quot; and received a Grammy Award on 16 February 2016 for best arrangement.
* In 2016, Jennifer Thomas included an instrumental version of &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; on her album &quot;Winter Symphony&quot;.
* In 2017, Lindsey Stirling released her version of &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; on her holiday album &quot;Warmer in the Winter&quot;.
* In 2018, Pentatonix released an a cappella arrangement of &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; on the holiday album &quot;Christmas Is Here!&quot;.
* In 2019, Madonna sampled a portion on her song &quot;Dark Ballet&quot; from her &quot;Madame X&quot; album.
* In 2019, Mariah Carey released a normal and an a cappella version of &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; entitled the &quot;Sugar Plum Fairy Introlude&quot; to open and close her 25th Deluxe Anniversary Edition of &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.
* In 2020, Coone made a hardstyle cover version titled &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

==Selected discography==
&quot;The Nutcracker&quot; made its initial appearance on disc in 1909 in an abridged performance on the Odeon label. Historically, this 4-disc set is considered to be the first record album. The recording was conducted by Herman Finck and featured the London Palace Orchestra. It was not until after the modern LP record appeared in 1948 that recordings of the complete ballet began to be made. Because of the ballet&#x27;s approximate ninety minute length when performed without intermission, applause, or interpolated numbers, the music requires two LPs. Most CD issues of the music take up two discs, often with fillers. An exception is the 81-minute 1998 Philips recording by Valery Gergiev that fits onto one CD because of Gergiev&#x27;s somewhat brisker tempi.
* In 1954, the first complete recording of the ballet was released on two LPs by Mercury Records. The cover design was by George Maas with illustrations by Dorothy Maas. The music was performed by the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Antal Doráti. Doráti later re-recorded the complete ballet in stereo, with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1962 for Mercury and with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1975 for Philips Classics. According to Mercury Records, the 1962 recording was made on 35mm magnetic film rather than audio tape, and used album cover art identical to that of the 1954 recording. Doráti is the only conductor so far to have made three different recordings of the complete ballet. Some critics have cited the 1975 recording as the finest ever made of the complete ballet. It is also faithful to the score in employing a boys&#x27; choir in the &quot;Waltz of the Snowflakes&quot;. Many other recordings use an adult or mixed choir.
* In 1956, Artur Rodziński and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra made a complete recording of the ballet in stereo for Westminster Records.
* In 1959, the first stereo LP album set of the complete ballet, with Ernest Ansermet conducting the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, appeared on Decca Records in the UK and London Records in the US.
* The first complete stereo &quot;Nutcracker&quot; with a Russian conductor and a Russian orchestra appeared in 1960, when Gennady Rozhdestvensky&#x27;s recording with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra, was issued first in the Soviet Union on the Melodiya label, then imported to the U.S. by Columbia Masterworks. It was also Columbia Masterworks&#x27; first complete &quot;Nutcracker&quot;.

With the advent of the stereo LP coinciding with the growing popularity of the complete ballet, many other complete recordings have been made. Notable conductors who have done so include Maurice Abravanel, André Previn, Michael Tilson Thomas, Mariss Jansons, Seiji Ozawa, Richard Bonynge, Semyon Bychkov, Alexander Vedernikov, Ondrej Lenard, Mikhail Pletnev, and Simon Rattle.
* The soundtrack of the 1977 television production with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland, featuring the National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Kenneth Schermerhorn, was issued in stereo on a Columbia Masterworks 2 LP-set, but has not appeared on CD. The LP soundtrack recording was, for a time, the only stereo version of the Baryshnikov &quot;Nutcracker&quot; available, since the performance was originally telecast in monophonic sound. The DVD of the performance is in stereo.
* The first complete recording of the ballet in digital stereo was issued in 1985, by RCA Red Seal featuring Leonard Slatkin conducting the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. RCA later reissued the recording in a multi-CD set containing complete recordings of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s two other ballets, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

There have been two major theatrical film versions of the ballet, and both have corresponding soundtrack albums.
* The first theatrical film adaptation, made in 1985, is of the Pacific Northwest Ballet version, and was conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras. The music is played in this production by the London Symphony Orchestra. The film was directed by Carroll Ballard, who had never before directed a ballet film (and has not done so since). Patricia Barker played Clara in the fantasy sequences, and Vanessa Sharp played her in the Christmas party scene. Wade Walthall was the Nutcracker Prince.
* The second film adaptation was a 1993 film of the New York City Ballet version, titled &quot;George Balanchine&#x27;s The Nutcracker&quot;, with David Zinman conducting the New York City Ballet Orchestra. The director was Emile Ardolino, who had won the Emmy, Obie, and Academy Awards for filming dance, and was to die of AIDS later that year. Principal dancers included the Balanchine muse Darci Kistler, who played the Sugar Plum Fairy, Heather Watts, Damian Woetzel, and Kyra Nichols. Two well-known actors also took part: Macaulay Culkin appeared as the Nutcracker/Prince, and Kevin Kline served as the offscreen narrator. The soundtrack features the interpolated number from &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; that Balanchine used in the production, and the music is heard on the album in the order that it appears in the film, not in the order that it appears in the original ballet.
* Notable albums of excerpts from the ballet, rather than just the usual &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;, were recorded by Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra for Columbia Masterworks, and Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for RCA Victor. Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra (for RCA Victor), as well as Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra (for Telarc) have also recorded albums of extended excerpts. The original issue of Michael Tilson Thomas&#x27;s version with the Philharmonia Orchestra on CBS Masterworks was complete. the currently available edition is abridged.

Ormandy, Reiner and Fiedler never recorded a complete version of the ballet; however, Kunzel&#x27;s album of excerpts runs 73 minutes, containing more than two-thirds of the music. Conductor Neeme Järvi has recorded act 2 of the ballet complete, along with excerpts from &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. The music is played by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.
* Many famous conductors of the twentieth century made recordings of the suite, but not of the complete ballet. These include Arturo Toscanini, Sir Thomas Beecham, Claudio Abbado, Leonard Bernstein, Herbert von Karajan, James Levine, Sir Neville Marriner, Robert Shaw, Mstislav Rostropovich, Sir Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Zubin Mehta, and John Williams.
* In 2007, Josh Perschbacher recorded an organ transcription of the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;.

==Ethnic stereotypes and cultural misattribution==
In the United States, commentary emerged in the 2010s about the Chinese and Arabian characteristic dances. In a 2014 article titled &quot;Sorry, &#x27;The Nutcracker&#x27; Is Racist&quot;, writer Alice Robb panned the typical choreography of the Chinese dance as white people wearing &quot;harem pants and a straw hat, eyes painted to look slanted&quot; and &quot;wearing chopsticks in their black wigs&quot;; the Arabian dance, she said, has a woman who &quot;slinks around the stage in a belly shirt, bells attached to her ankles&quot;. Similarly, dance professor Jennifer Fisher at the University of California, Irvine, complained in 2018 about the use in the Chinese dance of &quot;bobbing, subservient &#x27;kowtow&#x27; steps, Fu Manchu mustaches, and, especially, the often-used saffron-tinged makeup, widely known as &#x27;yellowface.&#x27;&quot;
In 2013, &quot;Dance Magazine&quot; printed the opinions of three directors: Ronald Alexander of Steps on Broadway and The Harlem School of the Arts said the characters in some of the dances were &quot;borderline caricatures, if not downright demeaning&quot;, and that some productions had made changes to improve this; Stoner Winslett of the Richmond Ballet said &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; was not racist and that her productions had a &quot;diverse cast&quot;; and Donald Byrd of Spectrum Dance Theater saw the ballet as Eurocentric and not racist. Some people who have performed in productions of the ballet do not see a problem because they are continuing what is viewed as &quot;a tradition&quot;. According to George Balanchine, the Arabian dance was a sensuous belly dance intended for the fathers, not the children.

Among the attempts to change the dances in the United States were Austin McCormick making the Arabian dance into a pole dance, and San Francisco Ballet and Pittsburgh Ballet Theater changing the Chinese dance to a dragon dance. Georgina Pazcoguin of the New York City Ballet and former dancer Phil Chan started the &quot;Final Bow for Yellowface&quot; movement and created a web site which explained the history of the practices and suggested changes. One of their points was that only the Chinese dance made dancers look like an ethnic group other than the one they belonged to. The New York City Ballet went on to drop geisha wigs and makeup and change some dance moves. Some other ballet companies followed.

&quot;The Nutcracker&quot;″s &quot;Arabian&quot; dance is in fact an embellished, exotified version of a traditional Georgian lullaby, with no genuine connection to the Arab culture. Alastair Macaulay of &quot;The New York Times&quot; defended Tchaikovsky, saying he &quot;never intended his Chinese and Arabian music to be ethnographically correct&quot;. He said, &quot;their extraordinary color and energy are far from condescending, and they make the world of &#x27;The Nutcracker&#x27; larger.&quot; To change anything is to &quot;unbalance &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;&quot; with music the author did not write. If there were stereotypes, Tchaikovsky also used them in representing his own country of Russia.

==In popular culture==
=== Film ===
Several films having little or nothing to do with the ballet or the original Hoffmann tale have used its music:
* The 1940 Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot; features a segment using The Nutcracker Suite.
* A 1951 thirty-minute short, &quot;Santa and the Fairy Snow Queen&quot;, issued on DVD by Something Weird Video, features several dances from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.
* In 1986, &quot;&quot; was released. It was a collaboration between the Pacific Northwest Ballet and illustrator Maurice Sendak.
* In 2001, &quot;Barbie in the Nutcracker&quot;, produced by Mainframe Entertainment and Mattel Entertainment, and distributed by Artisan Home Entertainment was loosely adapted from E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s 1816 short story, &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot;, and features music based from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1892 ballet, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;
* Disney announced that a remake of The Nutcracker would be directed by Robert Zemeckis through the use of motion capture, a technique that was used in &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, &quot;Monster House&quot;, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The film was cancelled following the box office disappointment of &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot;.
* In 2007 was released &quot;Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale&quot; featuring Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music from the ballet as score.
* In 2010, &quot;The Nutcracker in 3D&quot; with Elle Fanning abandoned the ballet and most of the story, retaining much of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music with lyrics by Tim Rice. The $90 million film became the year&#x27;s biggest box office bomb.
*In 2016, the Hallmark Channel presented &quot;A Nutcracker Christmas;&quot; a tele-film that contains a number of selected scenes of the 1892 two-act Nutcracker ballet.
*In 2017, the Athens State Orchestra in collaboration with Cinecreed Productions (former name: 1895 cinematic creations) presented &quot;A Different Nutcracker&quot; animation film, directed by Yiorgos Molvalis. At the premiere (Chr. Lamprakis, Athens Concert Hall, 26 December 2017) as Silent animation, the film was recorded live by the Athens State Orchestra. In 2020 the official recording was integrated in to the film marking its completion and making it available for screenings without the need to have the orchestra present.
* In 2018, the Disney live-action film &quot;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&quot; was released with Lasse Hallström and Joe Johnston as directors and a script by Ashleigh Powell.
* The 2024 Russian-Hungarian animated film &quot;The Nutcracker and the Magic Flute&quot; adapted the story and used the music, while combining them with other classical works.

===Television===
* The 1987 true crime miniseries &quot;&quot;, opens every episode with the first notes of the ballet amid scenes of Frances Schreuder&#x27;s daughter dancing to it in ballet dress.
* The 2015 Canadian television film &quot;The Curse of Clara: A Holiday Tale&quot;, based on an autobiographical short story by onetime Canadian ballet student Vickie Fagan, centres on a young ballet student preparing to dance the role of Clara in a production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

===Children&#x27;s recordings===
There have been several recorded children&#x27;s adaptations of the E. T. A. Hoffmann story (the basis for the ballet) using Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music, some quite faithful, some not. One that was not was a version titled &quot;The Nutcracker Suite for Children&quot;, narrated by Metropolitan Opera announcer Milton Cross, which used a two-piano arrangement of the music. It was released as a 78-RPM album set in the 1940s. A later version, titled &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;, starred Denise Bryer and a full cast, was released in the 1960s on LP and made use of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music in the original orchestral arrangements. It was quite faithful to Hoffmann&#x27;s story &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot;, on which the ballet is based, even to the point of including the section in which Clara cuts her arm on the glass toy cabinet, and also mentioning that she married the Prince at the end. It also included a less gruesome version of &quot;The Tale of the Hard Nut&quot;, the tale-within-a-tale in Hoffmann&#x27;s story. It was released as part of the Tale Spinners for Children series.

Spike Jones produced a 78 rpm record set &quot;Spike Jones presents for the kiddies The Nutcracker Suite (with Apologies to Tchaikovsky)&quot; in 1944. It includes the tracks: &quot;The Little Girl&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Land of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot;, &quot;The Fairy Ball&quot;, &quot;The Mysterious Room&quot;, &quot;Back to the Fairy Ball&quot; and &quot;End of the Little Girl&#x27;s Dream&quot;. This is all done in typical Spike Jones style, with the addition of choruses and some swing music. The entire recording is available at archive.com

===Journalism===
* In 2009, Pulitzer Prize–winning dance critic Sarah Kaufman wrote a series of articles for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticizing the primacy of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in the American repertory for stunting the creative evolution of ballet in the United States:
* In 2010, Alastair Macaulay, dance critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; (who had previously taken Kaufman to task for her criticism of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;) began &quot;The Nutcracker Chronicles&quot;, a series of blog articles documenting his travels across the United States to see different productions of the ballet.
* In 2014, Ellen O&#x27;Connell, who trained with the Royal Ballet in London, wrote, in Salon (website), on the darker side of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; story. In E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s original story, the &quot;Nutcracker and Mouse King,&quot; Marie&#x27;s (Clara&#x27;s), journey becomes a fevered delirium that transports her to a land where she sees sparkling Christmas Forests and Marzipan Castles, but in a world populated with dolls. Hoffmann&#x27;s tales were so bizarre, Sigmund Freud wrote about them in &quot;The Uncanny.&quot;

===Popular music===
* The song &quot;Dance Mystique&quot; (track B1) on the studio album &quot;Bach to the Blues&quot; (1964) by the Ramsey Lewis Trio is a jazz adaptation of Coffee (Arabian Dance).
* The song &quot;Fall Out&quot; by English band Mansun from their 1998 album &quot;Six&quot; heavily relies on the celesta theme from the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.
* The song &quot;Dark Ballet&quot; by American singer-songwriter Madonna samples the melody of Dance of the Reed Flutes (Danish Marzipan) which is often mistaken for Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. The song also relied on the lesser-known harp cadenza from Waltz of the Flowers. The same Tchaikovsky sample was earlier used in internationally famous 1992 ads for Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit &amp; Nut with &#x27;Madonna&#x27; as the singing chocolate bar (in Russian version the subtitles &quot;&#x27;This Is Madonna&#x27;&quot; () were displayed on a screen).

===Video games===
* &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; is played in one chapter of &quot;What Remains of Edith Finch&quot;.
* The official Nintendo published version of &quot;Tetris&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as the Game Boy Advance version of &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; features &quot;Dance of the Suger Plum Fairy&quot; as one of their music options, and the Game Boy version uses &quot;Trepak&quot; as victory music for clearing 25 lines on Type B level 9.
* &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; is played in a combat section of Fort Frolic in &quot;BioShock&quot;.
* &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; is played during the Symphony of Sorcery level in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance&quot;.

<text>A maritime museum (sometimes nautical museum) is a museum specializing in the display of objects relating to ships and travel on large bodies of water. A subcategory of maritime museums are naval museums, which focus on navies and the military use of the sea.

The great prize of a maritime museum is a historic ship (or a replica) made accessible as a museum ship, but as these are large and require a considerable budget to maintain, many museums preserve smaller or more fragile ships or partial ships within the museum buildings. Most museums exhibit interesting pieces of ships (such as a figurehead or cannon), ship models, and miscellaneous small items associated with ships and shipping, like cutlery, uniforms, and so forth.

Ship modellers often have a close association with maritime museums; not only does the museum have items that help the modeller achieve better accuracy, but the museum provides a display space for models larger than will comfortably fit in a modeller&#x27;s home, and of the museum is happy to take a ship model as a donation. Museums will also commission models.

There are thousands of maritime museums in the world. Many belong to the International Congress of Maritime Museums, which coordinates members&#x27; efforts to acquire, preserve, and display their material. There is a risk that too many maritime museums might dilute the experience for the public, while a poorly managed museum might put other municipalities off from the idea of hosting such a museum.

At the Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent, UK can lay claim to being the largest maritime museum in the world, incorporating numerous dockyard buildings, including a 1/4 mile long ropewalk, spinning rooms, covered slips, dry docks, smithery, sail loft, rigging house, mould loft, church, as well as three historic warships, it is the best preserved dockyard from the Age of Sail. However, the UK&#x27;s National Maritime Museum in Greenwich is also a contender, with many items of great historical significance, such as the actual uniform worn by Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. The largest in the United States of America is , Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Connecticut; it preserves not only a number of sailing ships, but also many original seaport buildings, including a ship chandlery, sail loft, ropewalk, and so forth. 

A recent activity of maritime museums is to build replicas of ships, since there are few survivors that have not already been restored and put on display. Another is operating a museum harbour, most notably in Germany and the Netherlands but elsewhere too, that offers mooring to privately owned historical vessels, which can be watched but not boarded.

== Preservation of ships ==
The preservation of ships in museums ensures that ancient and historic vessels are preserved for posterity in optimum conditions and are available for academic study and for public education and interest.

Remains of ancient and historic ships and boats can be seen in museums around the world. Where a ship is in a good state of preservation it can sometimes act as a museum in its own right. Many museum ships, such as HMS Victory are popular tourist attractions. Some ships are too fragile to be exposed outdoors or are incomplete and must be preserved indoors. The remains of the Mary Rose for example are kept in a purpose designed building so that conservation treatment can be applied.

In some cases, archaeologists have discovered traces of ships and boats where there are no extant physical remains to be preserved, such as Sutton Hoo, where museum displays can show what the vessel would have looked like, although the vessel itself no longer exists.

<text>The audio/modem riser (AMR) is a riser expansion slot found on the motherboards of some Pentium III, Pentium 4, Duron, and Athlon personal computers. It was designed by Intel to interface with chipsets and provide analog functionality, such as sound cards and modems, on an expansion card.

==Technology==
Physically, it has two rows of 23 pins, making 46 pins total. Three drawbacks of AMR are that it eliminates one PCI slot, it is not plug and play, and it does not allow for hardware accelerated cards (only software-based).

Technologically, it has been superseded by the Advanced Communications Riser (ACR) and Intel&#x27;s own communications and networking riser (CNR). However, riser technologies in general never really took off. Modems generally remained as PCI cards while audio and network interfaces were integrated on to motherboards.

<text>Carl Burton Stokes (June 21, 1927 – April 3, 1996) was an American politician and diplomat of the Democratic Party who served as the 51st mayor of Cleveland, Ohio. Elected on November 7, 1967, and taking office on January 1, 1968, he was one of the first black elected mayors of a major U.S. city.

==Early life==
Stokes was born in Cleveland&#x27;s Central neighborhood, the son of Louise (Stone) and Charles Stokes, a laundryman who died when Carl was around two or three years old. He and his brother, politician Louis Stokes, were raised by their mother at the CMHA&#x27;s Outhwaite Homes. Stokes was a strong student, but in 1944, he dropped out of high school and took up work at Thompson Products (later TRW). At 18, he joined the U.S. Army and returned to Cleveland after his discharge in 1946. After earning his diploma at East Technical High School the following year, Stokes, who was inspired by civil rights activist Paul Robeson, decided to pursue a career in public service. After attending several colleges, he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1954 from the University of Minnesota. In 1956, he graduated from Cleveland-Marshall College of Law and in 1957, was admitted to the Ohio State Bar Association. While studying law, he served as a probation officer. He served as assistant prosecutor for four years, eventually becoming a partner in the law firm of Stokes, Stokes, continuing that practice into his political career; it was successful after one year.

==Career==
Stokes served in the Ohio House of Representatives. He narrowly lost a bid for mayor of Cleveland in 1965. His victory two years later drew national attention, as he was the first black mayor of one of the ten biggest cities in the United States.

A charismatic political figure, Stokes had the ability to mobilize both black and white voters. With a 50.5% margin, he defeated Seth Taft, the grandson of former President William Howard Taft in 1967. At the time of his election, Cleveland was a majority white city with a 37% black population. A crucial part of his support came from local businessmen. After his election, Stokes said, &quot;I can find no more fitting way to end this appeal, by saying to all of you, in a more serious and in the most meaningful way that I can, that truly never before have I ever known to the extent that I know tonight, the full meaning of the words, &#x27;God Bless America&#x27;, thanks a lot.&quot;

As mayor, Stokes &quot;opened city hall jobs to blacks and women.&quot; He was known as a strong administrator and reformer, and is remembered for his vision and motivation. Stokes feuded with City Council and the Police Department for much of his tenure. He also initiated , a public and private funding program aimed at the revitalization of Cleveland neighborhoods. Despite fallout over the Glenville shootout, Stokes pulled through and was reelected in 1969. As mayor, he also played a pivotal role in the effort to restore Cleveland&#x27;s Cuyahoga River in the aftermath of the river fire of June 1969 that brought national attention to the issue of industrial pollution in Cleveland.

Stokes received the &quot;NNPA Award,&quot; highest honor of the National Newspaper Publishers Association in 1971.

After his mayoral administration, Stokes gave lectures to colleges around the country. In 1972, he became the first black anchorman in New York City after securing a job with WNBC-TV. While at WNBC New York, Stokes won a New York State Regional Emmy for excellence in craft, for a piece about the opening of the Paul Robeson play, starring James Earl Jones on Broadway. In 1979, he briefly visited Cleveland to endorse Mayor Dennis Kucinich in the 1979 Cleveland mayoral election, warning that &quot;if Voinovich wins, the Democrats might as well forget about the state of Ohio in 1980.&quot; After accusing NBC of failing to promote him to a national brief, he returned to Cleveland in 1980 and took up a stint with United Auto Workers, serving as general legal counsel.

Stokes became a municipal judge in Cleveland in 1983. Subsequently, President Bill Clinton appointed him U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Seychelles in 1994. Stokes received several civic awards, 12 honorary degrees, and served as a U.S. representative &quot;on numerous goodwill trips abroad by request of the White House.&quot; He was elected the first black president of the National League of Cities in 1970.

Stokes was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus while serving as Ambassador to the Seychelles and placed on medical leave. He returned to Cleveland and died at the Cleveland Clinic. His funeral was held at Cleveland Music Hall, presided over by the Rev. Otis Moss. The funeral was carried on WERE radio. Stokes was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

==Legacy==
The US Federal Courthouse Tower in downtown Cleveland, completed in 2002, was named the Carl B. Stokes Federal Court House Building. There are many other buildings, monuments and a street named for his memory within the City of Cleveland including the CMHA Carl Stokes Center, Stokes Boulevard, and the eponymous Carl Stokes Brigade club. Members of the Brigade celebrate his birthday every year at Lakeview Cemetery with gravesite services.

In November 2006, the Western Reserve Historical Society opened an exhibit entitled &quot;Carl and Louis Stokes: from Projects to Politics&quot;. Focusing on the brothers&#x27; early life at the Outhwaite projects, service in World War II, and eventual rise to politics, the exhibit ran until September 2008.

Perhaps Stokes&#x27; greatest legacy was his work to save and preserve Cleveland&#x27;s Cuyahoga River. Of his efforts, the National Park Service wrote:

<text>Freyung-Grafenau is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Passau, Deggendorf and Regen, the Czech Republic and by Austria.

==History==
The district was established in 1972, by merging the former districts of Grafenau and Wolfstein. In medieval times Wolfstein (east of the Ilz River) was the property of the bishop of Passau and the site of Wolfstein Castle, now a &quot;schloss&quot;. Grafenau (west of the Ilz River) successively belonged to different countries, before it was annexed by Bavaria in 1438. Wolfstein became a part of Bavaria two years after the dissolution of the clerical states in Germany (1803).

==Geography==

Freyung-Grafenau is the easternmost district of Bavaria. It is located in the southern part of the Bavarian Forest and is partially occupied by the Bavarian Forest National Park. The source of the Ilz River is situated in the district.

==Coat of arms==
The wolf represents the area of Wolfstein, while the bear stands for Grafenau (as it was ruled from the castle of &quot;Bärnstein&quot;, and &quot;Bär&quot; means &quot;bear&quot;). At the bottom sits the blue and white lozengy pattern of Bavaria.

<doc id="284938" wikidata="Q289839" url="?curid=284938" title="AC'97">
<text>AC&#x27;97 (&quot;Audio Codec &#x27;97;&quot; also MC&#x27;97 for &quot;Modem Codec &#x27;97&quot;) is an audio codec standard developed by Intel Architecture Labs and various codec manufacturers in 1997. The standard was used in motherboards, modems, and sound cards.

The specification covers two types of components, and the AC-Link digital interface between them:
# an AC&#x27;97 &quot;digital controller&quot; (DC97), which is typically built into the southbridge of the chipset, and
# an AC&#x27;97 audio and/or modem &quot;codec&quot;, available from several vendors, which contains the analog components of the architecture.

AC&#x27;97 defines a high-quality, 16- or 24-bit audio architecture with 5.1 surround sound support for the PC. AC&#x27;97 supports a 96 kHz sampling rate at 24-bit stereo resolution and a 48 kHz sampling rate at 24-bit stereo resolution for multichannel recording and playback.

Integrated audio is implemented with the AC&#x27;97 Codec on the motherboard, a communications and networking riser card, or an audio/modem riser card.

The first shipping system was in the Cyrix MediaGX, in 1997. Intel started shipping the initial I/O Controller Hub support in 1999, and it wasn&#x27;t until public shaming in 2000, that most PC OEMs started shipping AC&#x27;97 audio as the default.

In 2004, Intel released Intel High Definition Audio (HD Audio) which is a successor that is not backward compatible with AC&#x27;97. HD Audio has the capability to define up to 15 output channels, but in practice most motherboards provide no more than 8 channels (7.1 surround sound).

== Revisions ==

AC&#x27;97 has had several revisions:

* AC&#x27;97 1.x compliant indicates fixed 48 kHz sampling rate operation (non-extended feature set)
* AC&#x27;97 2.1 compliant indicates extended audio feature set (optional variable rate, multichannel, etc.)
* AC&#x27;97 2.2 compliant indicates extended audio, enhanced riser audio support, and optional Sony/Philips Digital Interface Format
* AC&#x27;97 2.3 compliant indicates extended configuration information and optional jack sensing support

AC&#x27;97 revision 2.3 enables Plug and Play for the end user. This revision provides means for the audio codec to supply parametric data about its analog interface much like Intel High Definition Audio.

==AC-Link==
The AC-Link is a digital link that connects the DC97 (the controller) with the audio &quot;codecs.&quot; It is composed of five wires: the 12.288 MHz , a 48 kHz signal, a signal, and two data wires which carry the actual audio data: and . The first four are outputs from the controller, while carries input from the codec. The link carries a bidirectional serial data stream at a fixed bitrate (12.288 Mbit/s) between the controller and one or more codecs.

Each 12.288 Mbit/s stream is divided into 256-bit frames (frame frequency is 48 kHz). This is therefore a time-division multiplexing scheme.

Every frame is subdivided in 13 slots. The first (slot 0) is 16 bits long and contains validity flags for the remaining slots, while the remaining 240 bits are divided in twelve 20-bit slots (slots 1–12), used as data slots.

Slots 1, 2 and 12 are used for non-audio data, while slots 3–11 carry up to nine channels of raw pulse-code modulation audio signals. Normally, six channels are used for 5.1 surround sound, and three channels are available for modem use. However, slots can be combined to provide a 96 kHz sampling rate for the L, R and C channels.

Lower sample rates (such as 44.1 kHz) are implemented using a handshake protocol between the controller and codec which skips data during certain frames. (This capability depends on the codec. Alternatively, sample rate conversion could be performed in the DC97 (controller) or in the software driver.)

==Codec chips==
Codec chips have an AC&#x27;97 interface on one side and analog audio interface on the other. They are usually small square chips with 48 pins (48-pin QFP package). They are D/A and A/D or only D/A.

==Front panel connector==
Computer motherboards often provide a connector to bring microphone and headphone signals to the computer&#x27;s front panel with standard color jack. Intel provides a specification for that header; the signal assignments are different for AC&#x27;97 and Intel High Definition Audio headers.

==Operating system support==
AC&#x27;97 is supported by most operating systems, such as Windows (starting with Windows 95) and Linux. Under DOS, applications access the sound hardware directly instead of through the operating system, and most DOS applications do not support AC&#x27;97. 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and later require a third-party driver for AC&#x27;97 support.

<text>A political party platform (American English), party program, or party manifesto (preferential term in British and often Commonwealth English) is a formal set of principal goals which are supported by a political party or individual candidate, to appeal to the general public, for the ultimate purpose of garnering the general public&#x27;s support and votes about complicated topics or issues. A component of a political platform is often called a plank – the opinions and viewpoints about an individual topic, as held by a party, person, or organization. The word &quot;plank&quot; depicts a component of an overall political platform, as a metaphorical reference to a basic stage made of boards or planks of wood. The metaphor can return to its literal origin when public speaking or debates are actually held upon a physical platform.

In the United Kingdom and certain other countries, the party platform is referred to as the party&#x27;s &quot;manifesto&quot; or political programme. The manifesto contains election pledges, or election promises. Across the Western world, political parties in power are highly likely to fulfill their election promises, research has found.

==Origins==
The first known use of the word &quot;platform&quot; was in 1535. The word &quot;platform&quot; comes from Middle French &quot;plate-forme&quot;, literally meaning &quot;flat form&quot;. The political meaning of the word to reflect &quot;statement of party politics&quot; is from 1803, probably originally an image of a literal platform on which politicians gather, stand, and make their appeals.

==Fulfilling platforms==

A 2017 study in the &quot;American Journal of Political Science&quot; that analyzed 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States) found that political parties in government fulfill their election promises to voters to a considerable extent. The study determined that:

Parties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.

Other research on the United States suggests that Democratic Party and Republican Party congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74 per cent and 89 per cent of the time, respectively.

<text>The oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), also known as the northern tiger cat, little spotted cat, and tigrillo, is a small spotted cat ranging from Central America to central Brazil. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and the population is threatened by deforestation and conversion of habitat to agricultural land.

In 2013, it was proposed to assign the oncilla populations in southern Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina to a new species: the southern tiger cat (&quot;L. guttulus&quot;), after it was found that it does not interbreed with the oncilla population in northeastern Brazil.

==Characteristics==
The oncilla resembles the margay (&quot;L. wiedii&quot;) and the ocelot (&quot;L. pardalis&quot;), but it is smaller, with a slender build and narrower muzzle. Oncillas are one of the smallest wild cats in South America, reaching a body length of with a long tail. While this is somewhat longer than the average domestic cat, the oncilla is generally lighter, weighing .

The fur is thick and soft, ranging from light brown to dark ochre, with numerous dark rosettes across the back and flanks. The underside is pale with dark spots and the tail is ringed. The backs of the ears are black with bold white spots. The rosettes are black or brown, open in the center, and irregularly shaped. The legs have medium-sized spots tapering to smaller spots near the paws. This coloration helps the oncilla blend in with the mottled sunlight of the tropical forest understory. The oncilla&#x27;s jaw is shortened, with fewer teeth, but with well-developed carnassials and canines.

Some melanistic oncillas have been reported from the more heavily forested parts of its range.

==Distribution and habitat==
The oncilla is distributed from a disjunct population in Costa Rica and Panama, and throughout the Amazon basin to central Brazil. It was recorded in Costa Rica&#x27;s cloud forests, in the northern Andes at elevations of and in dry Cerrado and Caatinga landscapes of northern Brazil.
In Panama, it was recorded in Darién, and in Volcán Barú National Parks.
In Colombia, it was recorded in the Cordillera Occidental at elevations of in Los Nevados National Natural Park, and in Antioquia Department.

==Ecology and behavior==
The oncilla is a primarily terrestrial animal, but also an adept climber. It is an obligate carnivore that hunts rodents, lizards, birds, eggs, invertebrates, and occasionally also tree frogs. It stalks its prey from a distance, and once in range, it pounces to catch and kill the prey.
Most oncillas are nocturnal, but in the Brazilian Caatinga – where diurnal lizards are their main food source – they are active during daylight. Young oncillas have been observed to purr; adults are known to make short, gurgling calls when close to one another.

===Reproduction===
Estrus lasts from three to nine days, with older cats having shorter cycles. Females give birth to one to three kittens after a gestation of 74–76 days. The kittens&#x27; eyes open after 8–17 days, an unusually long period for a cat of this size. Their teeth erupt more or less simultaneously at around 21 days of age. The kittens do not begin to take solid food until they are 38–56 days old, but are fully weaned by the age 90 days.

Oncillas reach sexual maturity around the age of 2–2.5years. They have a life span of about 11 years in the wild, but there are records of captive oncillas reaching age 17 years.

==Taxonomy==
The following are the traditionally recognized subspecies:
* &quot;Leopardus tigrinus tigrinus&quot;, eastern Venezuela, Guyana, northeastern Brazil; the nominate subspecies
* &quot;Leopardus tigrinus guttulus&quot;, Atlantic forest central and southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, northern Argentina (later recognised as a separate species, the southern tigrina)
* &quot;Leopardus tigrinus oncilla&quot;, Central America
* &quot;Leopardus tigrinus pardinoides&quot;, western Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru

Although the Central American oncilla is listed as a separate subspecies, based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA, Johnson et al. (1999) found strongly supported differences between &quot;L.t. oncilla&quot; in Costa Rica and &quot;L.t. guttulus&quot; in southern Brazil, comparable to differences between different neotropical species. Researchers have argued that there should be a splitting of the oncilla into two species, as there is a pronounced difference in appearance between the oncillas in Costa Rica and those in central and southern Brazil. Further samples of &quot;L.t. oncilla&quot; are needed from northern South America to determine whether this taxon ranges outside Central America, and whether it should be considered a distinct species rather than a subspecies.

In 2013, genetic research revealed that the former subspecies &quot;L. t. guttulus&quot; is a separate cryptic species that does not interbreed with the other subspecies, and proposes a classification into two species &quot;L. guttulus&quot; and &quot;L. tigrinus&quot;.

A zone of hybridization between the oncilla and the colocolo (Pampas cat) has been found through genetic analyses of specimens from central Brazil.

Results of a morphological analysis of 250 samples of skins and skulls indicate that there are three distinct oncilla groups: namely one in South America&#x27;s northern, north-western and western range countries, one in eastern and one in southern range countries. Based on these results, the eastern group was proposed to be a distinct species &quot;Leopardus emiliae&quot;. A further phylogenetic study published in 2021 supported the recognition of a third species.

==Threats==

The oncilla is mainly threatened by deforestation and poaching. Oncillas are killed for their pelts, which are highly prized and often sold or made into clothing. Reports in 1972 and 1982 in South America showed that the oncilla is one of the four most heavily hunted of all the small wild cats.

Another factor contributing to oncilla mortality is human expansion and conversion of land for settlements. Coffee plantations are most often established in cloud forest habitats, causing the reduction of preferred habitats.

Hybridization of the oncilla with the Geoffroy&#x27;s cat (&quot;Leopardus geoffroyi&quot;) has been found in the southernmost part of its range; hybridization with the Pampas cat (&quot;L. colocola&quot;) has also been found in central Brazil. Such hybridization may be a natural process, and the extent of this as a threat to the oncilla is unknown.

==Conservation==
The oncilla has been classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It is listed on CITES Appendix I, prohibiting all international commercial trade in oncillas or products made from them. Hunting is still allowed in Ecuador, Guyana, Nicaragua and Peru.

<text>The Oxford University Students&#x27; Union is the official students&#x27; union of the University of Oxford. It is better known in Oxford under the branding Oxford SU or by its previous name of OUSU. It exists to represent Oxford University students in the university&#x27;s decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body.

==History==
In 1961, the University of Oxford Proctors banned the student magazine &quot;Isis&quot; from publishing reviews of lectures. Students resisted, and legally incorporated the Oxford University Student Representative Council (OUSRC) for the first time. They then agitated for formal university recognition of the OUSRC, and petitioned the United Kingdom&#x27;s Privy Council, asking the government to amend the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act 1859. Rather than risk having its hand forced by legislation, the university relented, and formally recognised the OUSRC in 1970.

The OUSRC adopted its contemporary constitution in 1974, changing its name to the Oxford University Student Union, or OUSU. OUSU rebranded itself as Oxford SU in 2017 to improve its image among students at Oxford.

==Structure==
===Membership===
Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, Oxford SU is both an association of Oxford&#x27;s more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the constituent organisations: Junior Common Rooms (JCRs), Middle Common Rooms (MCRs), Graduate Common Rooms (GCRs), and other equivalent organisations that represent undergraduate and graduate students at the university&#x27;s forty-four colleges and permanent private halls and choose to allocate to the students&#x27;union.

Individual students can opt out of membership, although this right is rarely exercised. Individual Common Rooms can also disaffiliate, although few have chosen to do so since Oxford SU started being funded from a block grant from the university rather than through affiliation fees. Oriel College&#x27;s JCR disaffiliated itself from 2001 to 2010, and again on a temporary basis between January and June 2014; a referendum to disaffiliate permanently failed in 2015. Trinity College&#x27;s JCR disaffiliated in 2007, holding a referendum on affiliation each year, before reaffiliating in 2014. Christ Church&#x27;s JCR disaffiliated itself from the Student Union in 2021, with Brasenose JCR voting to disaffiliate from both the SU and NUS in 2023.

===Finances===

 has its own managing director and board of directors, and the corporation&#x27;s profits are all remanded to Oxford SU. OSSL&#x27;s primary activities are: Freshers&#x27; Fair, the three-day introduction in Oxford&#x27;s Examination Schools to clubs and societies, held during Freshers&#x27; week; publishing, primarily of handbooks for and by students, but also of &quot;The Oxford Student&quot; newspaper and Oxide Radio, a student radio station.

===Governance===
Oxford SU is made up an executive committee, which includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations, although this is not a requirement, and various part-time elected student positions. Also elected are Divisional Board Representatives who represent the students within their Division.

Oxford SU Council acts as the sovereign body of the Student Union, and has over 150 eligible voting members, specifically: every Oxford SU Executive Officer; every Divisional Board Representative; three representatives from each affiliated JCR; two or three representatives from each affiliated MCR/GCR; three votes representing each of the five Oxford SU Autonomous Liberation Campaigns and one vote representing each SU affiliated campaign. If a JCR, MCR, or GCR has fewer than 100 members, it receives one fewer Council vote. The Chair of Council is elected by the Council itself in each academic term.

In 2021/22, a governance review was conducted by President Anvee Bhutani which changed all six sabbatical officer positions and notably expanded the VP Women position to VP Liberation and Equality.

===Campaigns===
The 8 student campaigns are independent student lead organisations that work within the SU, which aim to represent, promote the interests of and hold events for self-identifying demographics.

5 are liberation campaigns, which have voting rights in student council and represent marginalised groups.
*Campaign for Racial Awareness and Equality (CRAE): BAME &amp; POC Students
*Class Act: Working Class, Low Income, First Generation, State Comprehensive, Care Leaver and Parentally Estranged Students.
*Disabilities Campaign (DisCam): Disabled Students.
*LGBTQ+ Campaign: LGBTQ+ Students.
*Wom*Cam: Women and Non-Binary Students 

The remaining 3 are sectional campaigns, which promote specific interests or represent specific groups.
*International Students Campaign: For International Students 
*It Happens Here (IHH): Anti Sexual Violence.
*Suspended Students Campaign (SusCam): For Suspended/Rusticated Students 

==Protests and occupations==

Shortly before the formation of OUSU in 1974, agitation commenced within certain sections of the student body for a Central Students Union building by the Student Representative Council, forerunner of OUSU. The university feared that the existence of such facilities would be used for the promotion of student activism. In 1972, during the miners strike, students had offered their rooms to miners picketing Didcot Power Station and had supported staff who went on strike at St Anne&#x27;s College.

On 5 November 1973, an open meeting called for direct action against the university on the issue of a Central Students Union building. Later that day students marched to the Examination Schools and commenced a sit in, which lasted seven days. The University Registrar sent an open letter to all Junior Members threatening proceedings in the High Court and disciplinary action against those who could be identified. The occupation was ended by students themselves after the university obtained a writ of possession.

OUSU was recognised by the university in early January 1974, and a meeting was held on 29 January with the Vice-Chancellor and others. The Vice-Chancellor made it clear that the university was facing deep cuts and there was no money for a CSU project.

The university was expecting a second occupation and contingency plans were drawn up. The Bursar of St John&#x27;s College wrote to the President of the Junior Common Room on 11 February noting, &quot;all the talk that is going on at the present time about occupation&quot;, and stating that in future the Bursary would be kept locked. It was reported that over £9,000 worth of damage had been done to the Examination Schools during the occupation the previous November. On 7 February an Extraordinary OUSU Council Meeting was held. Sue Lukes, David Aaronovitch and others attempted to defeat a motion stating that it was the position of OUSU not to support any occupation of university premises in furtherance of the CSU campaign. When this motion was put, Lukes and Aaronovitch resigned, the former making a speech condemning Council.

The following day, an anonymous flyer was circulated, headed &#x27;Remember 5 November&#x27;, it gave warning to the university that &quot;You have had three months and your time is up. Negotiations have failed, talking has failed, OUSU has failed. Come to the Open Meeting on Monday night in the Union Hall. And don&#x27;t forget your sleeping bag!&quot;

At 9.15 am on Wednesday 13 February approximately 50 or 60 students entered the Indian Institute building in Catte Street shouting that they were occupying it and demanding that the people working there should leave. The 22 staff inside stayed at their desks while the students milled around after first closing the doors. What happened next was the subject of bitter dispute. The university claimed that at around 11.30 am, about 50 volunteers, &#x27;relatively elderly gentlemen&#x27; working in the Clarendon Building decided out of concern for their colleagues to enter the building. A secretary let them in through a rear window, and once inside they confronted the intruders, who left in groups through the front door. The spokesman for the university insisted there was no violence, though it was conceded that there was some scrummaging and, &#x27;ears may have been twisted&#x27;.

Those supporting the occupiers claimed that the university had set the Oxford University Police upon them who, goaded on by the Proctors, perpetrated acts of violence against the students, and encouraged the police, who were outside, to wade in also. The supporters of the occupiers asserted it was a &#x27;pre-planned and ugly piece of violence&#x27;. It was alleged that at least one of the &#x27;relatively elderly gentlemen&#x27; was in fact a serving police officer out of uniform, who was identified at a subsequent demonstration.

The university identified those it believed to have been the ringleaders and moved swiftly against them. Eighteen students were charged with an offence under the University Statutes and were required to attend at the Proctor&#x27;s Office in cap and gown on 21 February under threat of being rusticated if they did not appear. The eighteen included Sue Lukes and another student from Somerville College, three from Magdalen and two each from Pembroke, St John&#x27;s and Balliol. They were committed for trial at a Disciplinary Court on 11 March, during the Easter vacation. The chairman of the Court was Barry Nicholas, a Professor of Comparative Law. All who attended agreed that the trial was a travesty of justice. Mike Sullivan wrote an open letter describing how the Court decided every procedural point against the defendants; several were expelled for making objections, including Tariq Ali who was acting as a McKenzie friend to some of the defendants. Gordon Day, President of St John&#x27;s Junior Common Room reported that even Andrew Turek, an ex-President of the university Monday Club and a virulent supporter of disciplinary action being taken against those who occupied University buildings, described the proceedings as a &#x27;farce&#x27; and labelled the University Marshall, Mr Skinner, as &#x27;a maniac who should not be allowed on University property&#x27;.

On the testimony, mainly, of a University Police Officer, Philip Berry, all of the defendants were convicted of being present at the occupation. It was admitted in Court that the Proctors were present together with other &#x27;employees&#x27; of the university and an &#x27;independent contractor&#x27; with two of his men. It was conceded that the &#x27;occupation&#x27; amounted to nothing more than possession of the stairs and corridors and no violence was at any time offered to University staff. Nevertheless, the eighteen defendants were all sent down with the sentence suspended for one year. A subsequent appeal by thirteen of the defendants failed.

The CSU campaign continued with declining support through the latter half of the 1970s.

=== 1980s: No Platform Referendum ===
A major upset occurred in the 1981 elections, when an Independent group of ex-JCR Presidents from apolitical colleges banded together as the &#x27;Bernadistas&#x27;, and won an overall majority. Alan Hughes of Trinity (known as &#x27;Bernard&#x27; because of his resemblance to Bernard Levin) was the President, and Jervis Smith of Queen&#x27;s served as the other sabbatical officer. 
In December 1985 OUSU adopted a No Platform policy following a controversial invitation to Patrick Harrington to speak at the Brasenose Debating Society. The Oxford University Conservative Association organised a petition of almost 700 signatures, more than the minimum requirement, to put the policy to a referendum of the student union&#x27;s members. In late February 1986, the No Platform policy was overturned by a vote of 3,152 against with 2,246 in favour.

===Protests and occupations 1990s to date===

Several student groups participated in protests against the introduction of tuition fees from 1998 onwards, with Oxford students playing a major role in the nationwide Campaign for Free Education. Activities included non-payment campaigns, the occupation of Exam Schools in 1998 and of the Development Office in November 1999, several marches and a short-lived blockade of the University Offices. OUSU support for these protests was limited in 1998, but became more formal during the presidency of Anneliese Dodds (1999). Following another occupation of Exam Schools in January 2004, the university pursued disciplinary action against five OUSU sabbatical officers.

In 2001 and 2007, OUSU led protests against speakers at the Oxford Union. In 2001, Kirsty McNeill led a successful protest to stop the visit of Holocaust denier David Irving to the debating society. In 2007, the Oxford Union attracted condemnation again for inviting Irving and BNP leader Nick Griffin to speak at a &quot;free speech forum&quot;. The then OUSU President, Martin McCluskey, led a campaign against the visits which attracted attention and support from national anti-fascist organisations, politicians and media commentators.

Oxford SU has also been mentioned in a Governmental enquiry of freedom of speech in universities due to one of its liberation campaigns disrupting a talk at St John&#x27;s College organised by a student anti-abortion rights group on abortion in Ireland. A protest started shortly after one of the organisers introduced the speakers and involved chants such as &quot;Pro-life, that&#x27;s a lie, you don&#x27;t care if women die&quot;. The police were called after one of the protesters got into a minor altercation with a security guard, although no arrests were made and the talk eventually started after 40 minutes.

Both the SU and the anti-abortion rights group later issued statements about the event with the SU stating that &quot;We do not believe that the speakers invited should be hosted without challenge. We were not protesting Oxford Students for Life or their speakers&#x27; right to free speech&quot; and also that &quot;bodily autonomy is not up for debate&quot;. The anti-abortion rights group called this &quot;a deliberate attempt to shut down discussion and dialogue through harassment and bullying&quot; and later issued a second statement accusing the SU of breaking the law. One of the speakers later wrote an article for the &quot;Irish Times&quot; on her experiences of the event.

The SU voted on 10 February 2018 to support Oxford university staff&#x27;s strike action against proposed changes to the University Superannuation Scheme (USS). Oxford University staff union members voted to join 60 other universities in the national strike action, coordinated by the University and College Union (UCU) after a breakdown in its negotiations with the university employers&#x27; representative, Universities UK (UUK), over UUK&#x27;s proposals to remove the defined benefit element of the USS pension scheme.

Student groups affiliated with the SU have led repeated environmental protests in recent years at the University of Oxford. In 2017, the Paradise Papers showed large Oxford and Cambridge Universities&#x27; investments in fossil fuels, prompting student union action, including Cambridge Zero Carbon Society and the Oxford Climate Justice Campaign (an OUSU Environment &amp; Ethics campaign) disrupting the annual Oxford-Cambridge boat race, and the OCJC occupation of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, to protest its investments in large multinational fossil fuel companies like BP and Shell. In 2021, the Climate League of Oxford and Cambridge was created to lobby colleges for transparency around climate info.

== Controversies ==

=== Rashmi Samant ===
In 2021, Rashmi Samant, pursuing MSc in Energy Systems at Linacre College, became the first Indian president-elect of Oxford SU. Shortly, several Oxford societies condemned her social media posts for displaying racially insensitive, anti-Semitic, and transphobic sentiments and asked her to resign; Samant apologised, and, facing multiple successful no-confidence motions at individual colleges, did resign.

Afterwards, Abhijit Sarkar, a postdoctoral scholar of history of S. Asia at New College, posted a photo of Samant&#x27;s parents framed with the slogan of Jai Shri Ram — that has been increasingly used in India, as a nationalistic war-cry to perpetrate communal violence — and claimed them to be celebrating the destruction of a mosque in India; Sarkar also claimed Samant&#x27;s alumna institution in India to be a hotbed of Islamophobic far-right forces. Samant has since alleged that she was &quot;cyber-lynched&quot; into resigning, and that her critics were motivated by racism. The Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party demanded that the university probe into the anti-Hindu atmosphere; Indian Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar supported Samant and even promised to raise the issue with his British counterparts, if required.

The Oxford Hindu, Indian, and South Asian societies dismissed Samant&#x27;s allegations as part of a &quot;misleading narrative&quot;, that fed into the &quot;fundamentally exclusionary and discriminatory&quot; nature of Hindutva. An Indian-origin Hindu student went on to win the by-election.

=== Danial Hussain ===
In 2023, the Oxford Student reported that the current president, Danial Hussain, was suspended after allegedly exposing SU staff to gay pornography via Google Drive, as well as revealing that the President had previously been suspended earlier that year over allegations of serious misconduct. Hussain downplayed the allegations, claiming he was a victim of a &quot;prank&quot; by his friends. This followed earlier calls for impeachment after allegations that the President &#x27;lied&#x27; about consulting students over rule changes to the SU&#x27;s Student Council. Hussain was later reinstated to the role after 4 months, with the SU refusing to &quot;comment on confidential HR matters&quot;.

==List of former presidents==

*1971 – Emily Wallace (Somerville) was elected OUSRC president, the first president of Oxford students to be officially recognised by the university.
*1982 – John Grogan became the first president to succeed in obtaining a seat for students at the university&#x27;s governing council, in June 1983. He and two other students chosen by OUSU became observers for most of the council&#x27;s agenda, and this practice was enshrined in the university&#x27;s &quot;Statutes, Decrees, and Regulations&quot;.
*1985-86 – Matthew Taylor, subsequently became a Liberal Party Member of Parliament and Member of the House of Lords.
*1986-87 – Mark Stephens.
*1993 – Akaash Maharaj became the first ever visible ethnic minority president and also the first president from overseas (Canada). He helped lead a successful national campaign that thwarted a 1994 government bill to restrict the ability of students&#x27; unions to comment on public policy issues and that contributed to the ultimate dismissal from Cabinet of the then Secretary of State for Education, John Patten.
*2000/01 – Kirsty McNeill
*2001/02 – Anneliese Dodds
*2003 – Will Straw carried out protests against the government&#x27;s introduction of tuition fees for students, despite his father Jack Straw being a senior member of the government of the day.
*2007/08 – Martin McCluskey
*2009/10 – Alan Strickland
*2010/11 – David Barclay 
*2011/12 – Martha Mackenzie
*2013/14 – Tom Rutland
*2014/15 – Louis Trup 
*2016 – Becky Howe 
*2017/18 – Kate Cole 
*2020 – Nikita Ma (Trinity) is the first East Asian president and the first president from Asia.
*2020/21 – Rashmi Samant Elected but then resigned.
*2021 – Anvee Bhutani (Magdalen) led the first all women of colour SU sabbatical officer team. She championed net-zero, support for survivors of sexual assault and spearheaded a comprehensive governance review package that was unanimously approved. Bhutani also helped select the next Vice Chancellor of the university. 
*2023 – Danial Hussain (LMH). The first foundation year student to be elected President.
*2024/25 – Addi Haran (Lincoln). The first trans person and DPhil student to be elected President.

==Sabbatical Officers==
Prior to 2023, the 6 Sabbatical Officers of the SU were: President, VP for Access and Academic Affairs, VP Charities and Community, VP Welfare and Equal Opportunities, VP Women and VP Graduates. A review instigated by President Anvee Bhutani (2021–22) changed this.

Following Bhutani&#x27;s review, the VP Sabbatical roles were amended with the purpose of increasing inclusion, particularly of postgraduates. The amendment of VP for women sparked controversy, with the post-holder at the time, Ellie Greaves, critiquing the decision. The following months would see Greaves resign from her position.

Amended roles were first elected in 2023.

<doc id="284957" wikidata="Q1284961" url="?curid=284957" title="Porky's">
<text>Porky&#x27;s is a 1981 sex comedy film written and directed by Bob Clark about the escapades of teenagers in 1954 at the fictional Angel Beach High School in Florida. The film stars Kim Cattrall, Scott Colomby, Kaki Hunter, Nancy Parsons, Alex Karras, and Susan Clark.

The film influenced many writers in the teen film genre and spawned two sequels: &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; (1983) and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot; (1985), and an ashcan copy titled &quot;Porky&#x27;s Pimpin&#x27; Pee Wee&quot; (2009). &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; was the sixth highest-grossing film of 1982. The film received generally positive reviews at the time of its release, but reviews have become more mixed-to-negative over time.

==Plot==
In 1954, each boy in a group of Florida Angel Beach High School students plans to lose his virginity. They go to Porky&#x27;s, a strip club in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. The club&#x27;s proprietor, Porky, takes their money but humiliates the boys by dumping them into the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, Porky&#x27;s brother, drives them away but not before he extorts them for the rest of their money, further embarrassing them.

After Mickey, who returned to Porky&#x27;s for revenge, is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually sinking Porky&#x27;s establishment into the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase the group, but the boys make it across the county line, out of Porky&#x27;s brother&#x27;s jurisdiction, where local police officers and the high school band meet them. One of the officers, Mickey&#x27;s older brother, Ted, repeatedly damages Porky&#x27;s Hudson Hornet, promising to drop all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle if the night&#x27;s events are forgiven. Because the boys are too young to have been allowed into Porky&#x27;s legally, Porky and his brother agree.

In a subplot, the boys peep on female students in the girl&#x27;s locker room shower, and Tommy, Billy, and Pee Wee see several girls showering. Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at an obese girl, who has been blocking his view, to move so that he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his penis through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker, who has a running feud with Tommy, walks into the shower area. Spotting the protruding member, she sneaks up on Tommy, grabs his penis, and pulls with all her might. Tommy pulls free and escapes, but Beulah is determined to prove that the offending member, which has a mole on it, belongs to Tommy, going so far as to request that Principal Carter hold a police-type line-up of the boys in the nude so she can identify it. However, Carter balks at her request. As the other basketball coaches laugh, Coach Brackett suggests asking the police to send a sketch artist and hang wanted posters around the school. When that suggestion gets even Carter laughing, Balbricker leaves in a huff. At the end of the film, she sneaks out of the bushes to ambush Tommy and actually drags his pants down, but she is pulled off him by police and dragged away screaming that she saw &quot;it&quot; and that she can identify its owner. Tommy breaks the fourth wall, saying, &quot;Jeez!&quot; to the camera.

Another subplot involves Coach Brackett taking an interest in the attractive coach, Lynn Honeywell. Coach Warren repeatedly refers to Honeywell as &quot;Lassie&quot; while pointing to the equipment room, much to Coach Brackett&#x27;s confusion. He quickly finds out why when he and Honeywell hide out in the equipment room after an argument with Balbricker, and Honeywell becomes turned on by the scent of the room. This leads to the pair having quickie sex in the room, as Honeywell begins loudly howling like a dog, thus revealing why she is called Lassie. Her orgasmic howls are heard throughout the entire school, much to the students&#x27; and Coach Warren&#x27;s amusement, but not to Balbricker and head coach Goodenough. Brackett and Honeywell are eventually fired as a result.

==Cast==
==Production==
Bob Clark got the idea to make the film in 1972. It was based on his experiences with five high school friends in Florida in the 1950s. He based the story on actual occurrences at Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport, Florida, and Fort Lauderdale High School in the early 1960s, and on a venue called Porky&#x27;s Hide Away in Oakland Park, Florida.

Clark teamed up with Roger Swaybill on a film, &quot;Breaking Point&quot;. When Clark fell ill with mononucleosis in 1979, he dictated the story of &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; to Swaybill, who then wrote a draft of the script. Every studio in Hollywood turned down the project. Clark eventually obtained financing from Melvin Simon Productions and a Canadian firm, Astral Bellevue Pathe. The film had to be made in Canada to obtain government tax benefits. This meant Clark, who was an American, got sole screen credit as writer. However, Swaybill was reimbursed with a six-figure sum and was co-writer on the sequel.

&quot;It seems incredible to realize that &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, which earned more than $200 million worldwide, was done as a tax shelter, but that&#x27;s the way it was,&quot; Swaybill says.

Kim Cattrall took a small role in the film because she needed the money, and was horrified, at first, to see her name at the top of the poster: &quot;People thought it was the end of my career&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; was released in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Columbia, South Carolina, on November 13, 1981. It then received a wide release in Canada and the United States on March 19, 1982.

In Ireland, the film was banned on February 1, 1982; the decision was overturned 19 days later.

===Critical response===
Upon its release, &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; was viewed as &quot;a likeable coming-of-age comedy&quot;, but the critical appraisal has been more negative since then. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which collects both contemporary and modern reviews, gives the film a score of 33% based on reviews from 39 critics and an average rating of 4.8/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Gleeful in its misogyny and celebratory of bad behavior, &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; is an intermittently funny farce that will leave audiences feeling in need of a shower.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 40% based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert in their syndicated &quot;At the Movies&quot; television series both expressed disdain for &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; and later called it one of the worst films of 1982. In particular, they criticized the film for what they viewed as its objectification and degradation of women and the childish nature of its antagonists, and they disliked that the film took what they felt was a thin, shallow and off-color stance against anti-Semitism. In his print review for &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert noted that the film&#x27;s sexual content &quot;per se&quot; was not the film&#x27;s failing, but rather the manner it was used: &quot;Even in an easy scene like the one where the guys spy on the girls in the locker room, the director, Bob Clark, blows it. Peeping Tom scenes can be very funny (remember John Belushi on the ladder in &quot;Animal House&quot;?) Here, it&#x27;s just smarmy.&quot; Siskel would later go on to call it one of the worst films ever made.

===Box office===
The film grossed $7.6 million for the weekend when it opened wide in 1982. It grossed a total of $106 million in its initial release in the United States and Canada, including $12 million in Canada. It grossed $25–30 million overseas, for a worldwide gross of over $130 million. Although it was written and directed by an American and was filmed in Miami and Miami Beach Florida, &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; was produced by the Canadian company Astral Media. As a result, &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; can be classed as the highest-grossing Canadian film of all time in the United States and Canada, with a total of C$111 million by 1999, including $6 million from a 1983 re-issue prior to the release of the sequel.

Including the re-issue, the film grossed $160 million worldwide.

===Home media===

On May 22, 2007, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released all three films in an &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; box set on DVD.

The DVD of the film from the &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; was also released as a stand-alone release called the &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; Edition and includes a retrospective featurette with Bob Clark, a discussion on how &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; is a comedy classic, movie commentary by Clark, the theatrical trailer, two television spots, trailers for &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot;, and the sales pitch for the &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; video game.

&quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; was released on Blu-ray on September 25, 2012. The bonus material for the Blu-ray is the bonus material from the &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; Edition that focuses on the movie itself. The trailers for &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot;, and the &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; video game sales pitch were not included as bonus materials for the Blu-ray release.

==Sequels and additional media==
The first two &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; films were directed by Bob Clark and produced by Harold Greenberg, who founded Astral Communications (now known as Astral Media). Following the success of &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; in North America and Europe, a sequel, &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot;, was released in 1983. It was poorly received by critics and was less commercially successful than the original. Bob Clark did not want to make another film in the series, so director James Komack made the third and last part of the saga. The third film, &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot;, was the worst-received of the series both critically and commercially. Although it was not originally part of the series, the film &quot;Hollywood Zap!&quot; was released as a &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; film in Europe.

A video game based on the film, also titled &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, was released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 8-bit computers by 20th Century Fox in 1983.

The movie was mentioned in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;, when Sheldon says that Missy is watching it.

==Remake==
In 2002, Howard Stern acquired the remake rights and has long hoped to produce a remake of the film. The potential remake ran into legal trouble in 2011 when two other production companies stepped forward claiming to own the rights. In 2013, the parties reached a confidential settlement and agreed to dismiss a claim and counterclaim with prejudice. The terms of the settlement remain confidential, and to date, if it allows for Stern&#x27;s remake to be made is unknown.

A cheap spinoff, &quot;Porky&#x27;s Pimpin&#x27; Pee Wee&quot;, was made in order to retain the rights for a further seven years and released via video on demand in 2009.

<text>Joy Fielding (née Tepperman; born March 18, 1945) is a Canadian novelist and actress. She lives in Toronto, Ontario.

==Biography==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, she graduated from the University of Toronto in 1966, with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. As Joy Tepperman, she had a brief acting career, appearing in the film &quot;Winter Kept Us Warm&quot; (1965) and in an episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. She later changed her last name to Fielding (after Henry Fielding) and began writing novels.

Fielding is also the screenwriter of the television film &quot;Golden Will: The Silken Laumann Story&quot;.

In the 1980s, she was also a regular contributor of book reviews to Jack Farr&#x27;s CBC Radio program &quot;The Radio Show&quot;.

==Personal==
At the age of 8, Tepperman wrote her first story and sent it into a local magazine, and at age 12 sent in her first TV script, however both were rejected. She had a brief acting career, eventually giving it up to write full-time in 1972. She has published 30 novels and 1 Novella (as of September 2022), two of which were converted into film. Fielding&#x27;s process of having an idea to the point the novel is finished generally takes a year, the writing itself taking four to eight months.

Fielding sets most of her novels in American cities such as Boston and Chicago. She has said that she prefers to set her novels in &quot;big American cities, [as the] landscape seems best for [her] themes of urban alienation and loss of identity.&quot;

Fielding is a Canadian citizen. Her husband is noted Toronto attorney, Warren Seyffert. They have two daughters, Annie and Shannon, and own property in Toronto, Ontario, as well as Palm Beach, Florida.

==Interview==
Fielding had an interview with the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; in 2007, just after her publication of &quot;Heartstopper&quot;. She enjoys catching readers off guard with the endings of her stories, but insists that it &quot;isn&#x27;t what her fiction is about&quot;, but rather more about the development of her characters.

Discussing her novels with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2008, she said &quot;I might not write fiction in the literary sense. But I write very well. My characters are good. My dialog is good. And my stories are really involving. I&#x27;m writing exactly the kind of books I like to write. And they&#x27;re the kind of books I like to read. They&#x27;re popular commercial fiction. That&#x27;s what they are.&quot;

==Audience==

Fielding has been noted as a novelist who is more popular in the United States and foreign countries, rather than in her native Canada. For example, the novel &quot;Kiss Mommy Goodbye&quot; was more popular in the States, and &quot;See Jane Run&quot; in Germany. In addition, she had an American agent and publisher, although she has now switched to a Canadian publisher.

<doc id="284961" wikidata="Q7660914" url="?curid=284961" title="Sylvia Fraser">
<text>Sylvia Fraser (born Sylvia Lois Meyers; 8 March 1935 – 25 October 2022) was a Canadian novelist, journalist and travel writer. Fraser was educated at the University of Western Ontario. In Fraser&#x27;s long year career as a journalist, Fraser wrote hundreds of articles, beginning as a feature writer for the &quot;Toronto Star Weekly&quot; (1957–68), and continuing with articles for many other magazines and newspapers including &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Chatelaine&quot;, &quot;The Walrus&quot; and &quot;Toronto Life&quot;. Fraser taught creative writing for many years at the Banff Centre and at various university workshops. 

Fraser participated in extensive media tours, gave lectures and readings throughout Canada, the United States, Britain and Sweden. Fraser served on the Arts Advisory Panel to the Canada Council and was a member of Canada Council&#x27;s 1985 cultural delegation to China. Fraser was a founding member of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada and for many years was on the executive of the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada, a charitable organization for the support of Canadian authors and literature. Fraser lived in Toronto, Ontario.

== Early life and education ==
Sylvia Lois Meyers was born in Hamilton, Ontario, the second daughter of George and Gladys Meyers. Her father, a former World War One lieutenant, worked for the Steel Company of Canada and her mother was involved in Livingstone United Church and community work. In 1957, Fraser married Russell Fraser, a lawyer. After Toronto Star Weekly ceased publication in 1968, Fraser began writing novels.

Fraser was repeatedly sexually abused by her father from her early childhood to her late teens, which became a recurring topic in several of her fiction and non-fiction works, including &quot;Pandora, My Father&#x27;s House, The Book of Strange,&quot; and &quot;The Ancestral Suitcase.&quot; However, Fraser repressed these memories for most of her life, and did not remember them until Fraser began writing about it in these works.

== Career ==
Fraser&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Pandora&quot;, tells the story of a young girl who is sexually abused by the man who delivers bread to her house. It was highly regarded for its prose and launched Fraser&#x27;s career in Canadian Literature.

In 1983, while lunching with friends Ms. Fraser suddenly and clearly remembered the abuse she had suffered from her father. Afterward, Fraser divested her possessions and moved to California where she spent the next two years writing the book that helped deal with the pain and trauma of the abuse. The resulting memoir, &quot;My Father&#x27;s House&quot; (1987), recounts the sexual abuse she was subject to from her father throughout her childhood. The book had multiple hardcover and paperback printings and was translated into eight languages. It won the Canadian Authors Association Literary Award for non-fiction. Scholars have asserted that it sets an exemplary model of the process of surviving trauma.

Her subsequent books, &quot;The Book of Strange&quot; (1992, since republished as &quot;The Quest for the Fourth Monkey&quot;) and &quot;The Ancestral Suitcase&quot; (1996) deal with nonlinear time, reincarnation, and memory.

In addition to her books, Fraser taught creative writing at the Banff Centre for the Arts and wrote profiles for &quot;Toronto Life&quot; and other magazines. Fraser also ghostwrote memoirs, including &quot;Unsinkable&quot; (2014), for Olympic rower Silken Laumann, and &quot;Open Heart, Open Mind&quot; (2015) for Olympic cyclist and speed skater Clara Hughes.

<text>Dagobert (or Daibert or Daimbert) (died 1105) was the first Archbishop of Pisa and the second Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem after the city was captured in the First Crusade.

==Early life==

Little is known of Dagobert&#x27;s early life, but he is thought to have originally been ordained by Wezilo, Archbishop of Mainz 1084-88, a leading supporter of the emperor in the Investiture Controversy and of the Antipope Clement III. In 1085, Wezilo was excommunicated for simony by the pro-papal synod of Quedlinburg. Dagobert&#x27;s own name places his origin in Lombardy/Emilia, site of some staunchly imperial cities.

==(Arch)bishop of Pisa==

By the late 1080s Dagobert had changed sides, becoming close to Countess Matilda of Tuscany, one of the papacy&#x27;s staunchest supporters. Pope Urban II cancelled Dagobert&#x27;s irregular ordination and replaced it with a canonical one, and in 1088 made him Bishop of Pisa. Initially, the appointment of a man with such a controversial past attracted hostility. Peter, Bishop of Pistoia, protested to the pope, and the cathedral chapter opposed it, but Urban&#x27;s continued support allowed Dagobert to establish his authority. He played an active role in Pisa&#x27;s civic life, for example joining with other notables in 1090 to regulate the maximum height of houses, and by 1092 the clergy were signing his documents. He seems to have become a well-respected figure in Pisa&#x27;s political and economic life, adopting a practical approach to the problems he faced both in Pisa and later in his career. He remained close to Urban and Matilda, and in 1092 Urban raised the see to an archbishopric on Matilda&#x27;s recommendation.

Dagobert spent Christmas of 1094 with Pope Urban, and then accompanied him on his pastoral tour of Italy and France, including the Council of Piacenza, held to reassert the pope&#x27;s authority after the Investiture Controversy, and the Council of Clermont, at which the pope launched the First Crusade. Dagobert then returned to Pisa to preach the crusade, and received enthusiastic support. In 1098 Urban appointed him legate at the court of King Alfonso VI of Castile, and he proved competent in his organisation of the church in the lands recently conquered from the Moors, although he was rumoured to have kept for himself some treasure sent by King Alfonso to the Pope.

==Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem==

Before the end of 1098 Dagobert set out for the east with a lawless Pisan fleet, which made successful raids on Byzantine owned islands and skirmished with the Byzantine navy, before going on to Syria. One of the Crusader leaders, Bohemond of Antioch, was besieging the Byzantine port of Latakia, and Dagobert and the Pisans agreed to help by blockading the port from the sea. However, the other Crusader leaders, who saw the necessity for cooperation with the Byzantine Emperor and eastern Christians, were horrified and persuaded Dagobert to call off the blockade. Bohemund was forced to abandon the siege, and accompanied Dagobert to Jerusalem, arriving on 21 December 1099.

Dagobert&#x27;s status when he went east is unclear. Many historians believe that Urban had appointed him apostolic legate to the crusade in succession to Adhemar of Le Puy, who died on 1 August 1098. However, Urban himself died on 29 July 1099, and in a letter to the new pope, Paschal II, in September 1099, Dagobert styles himself simply &#x27;archbishop of Pisa&#x27;.

Immediately after Christmas, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Arnulf of Chocques, was deposed on the ground that his election had been uncanonical, and with Bohemund&#x27;s support, Dagobert was elected in his place. Public opinion had always held that the Holy Land should be the patrimony of the church, but Arnulf had been too weak to establish supremacy. Dagobert&#x27;s position was stronger, as he was (probably) papal legate and had the support of the Pisan fleet. Immediately after his enthronement, Godfrey of Bouillon knelt before him and was invested with the territory of Jerusalem, and Bohemund did the same for Antioch. Baldwin, the future King of Jerusalem, was at this time Lord of Edessa, but he did not pay homage for it to Dagobert, and their relations do not seem to have been good.

Dagobert was anxious to establish the patriarch&#x27;s power, and he demanded that Godfrey hand over Jerusalem to him. Godfrey partly yielded, and at a ceremony on Easter Day, 1 April 1100, he announced that he would retain possession until his death, or until he conquered two great cities from the infidel, but he bequeathed Jerusalem to the Patriarch. However, Godfrey died in July, when Dagobert was accompanying a campaign against Jaffa under Bohemund&#x27;s nephew, Tancred, Prince of Galilee, and the Jerusalem knights offered the lordship to Baldwin, who was Godfrey&#x27;s brother. With the support of Tancred, Dagobert wrote offering the lordship of Jerusalem to Bohemund, but the letter was intercepted and Bohemund was captured by the Turks.
On 11 November, Baldwin assumed the title King of Jerusalem. Dagobert was forced to accept defeat, and Baldwin, bearing in mind his influence over the Pisan fleet, confirmed him in his see. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin paid homage to the Patriarch and was crowned as king. The arrival of a Genoese squadron in April 1101 weakened Dagobert&#x27;s position, as Baldwin no longer depended for sea power on the Pisan fleet. He needed to control the church, as he was always short of money, and pious symphasisers gave their donations to the church. Complaints had been made about the legality of Dagobert&#x27;s appointment, and when the pope sent a legate, Maurice, Cardinal-Bishop of Porto, to enquire into the situation, Baldwin accused Dagobert of treachery for urging Bohemond to oppose Baldwin&#x27;s succession. Dagobert bribed Baldwin to drop the complaint. However, in the autumn Dagobert kept the whole of a donation partly intended for the king for his army, and for this the legate deprived him of his position.

Tancred, who now ruled Antioch, welcomed Dagobert to the city, where he put the Church of St George at his disposal. Maurice died in the spring of 1102, and when Baldwin needed Tancred&#x27;s military help in the autumn, Tancred insisted on Dagobert&#x27;s restoration as a condition of his assistance. Baldwin agreed, but then a new legate arrived, Cardinal Robert of Paris. Baldwin and Arnulf of Chocques, whom Dagobert had replaced as Patriarch, engineered further charges before a synod under Robert. He was charged with attacking fellow-Christians in his raids on Byzantine islands on his journey to the east, of conspiring to provoke a civil war between Bohemond and Baldwin, and keeping for himself money given for the welfare of pilgrims, and deposed as Patriarch. Tancred again welcomed him to Antioch but did not further press his claim. In Steven Runciman&#x27;s view, he had shown himself a corrupt and miserly old man, and his departure was not regretted.

Dagobert later went to appeal to Pope Paschal personally. The appeal was successful, and Dagobert was on his way back to reclaim the patriarchate when he died in Messina in Sicily in 1105. Dagobert was replaced during his absence by a priest called Ehremar, and Ghibbelin of Arles succeeded on Dagobert&#x27;s death. He was succeeded as Archbishop of Pisa by Pietro Moriconi, who may have been elected by the Pisans before Dagobert&#x27;s death, suggesting that he might have lost support after his long – and pluralistic – absence, but charters in the cathedral archives show that his actions during his tenure were later repeatedly cited and confirmed.

==Reputation==

Historians have generally been highly critical of Dagobert&#x27;s conduct in the Holy Land. Steven Runciman in his history of the First Crusade, describes him as vigorous, but vain, ambitious, dishonest and easily influenced. In a 1998 study Michael Matzke defended Dagobert, arguing that his actions as patriarch were motivated by religious idealism, and that he was trying to carry out the intentions of Pope Urban. Historians have strongly disagreed whether this rehabilitation is convincing. Patricia Skinner, in her survey of Dagobert&#x27;s career, accepts that he acted against canon law, but argues that in the exceptional circumstances of the time, he had to act pragmatically.

The name of the Holy Sepulchre church in Pisa is a reference to Dagobert&#x27;s participation to the Crusade.

<text>David Benson French, OC (January 18, 1939December 5, 2010) was a Canadian playwright, most noted for his &quot;Mercer Plays&quot; series of &quot;Leaving Home&quot;, &quot;Of the Fields, Lately&quot;, &quot;Salt-Water Moon&quot;, &quot;1949&quot; and &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Heart&quot;.

==Early life==
French was born in the tiny Newfoundland outport of Coley&#x27;s Point, the middle child in a family of five boys. His father, Garfield French, was a carpenter, and during World War II worked for the Eastern Air Command in Canada. After the war, David&#x27;s mother, Edith, came to Ontario with the boys to join their father and the family settled in Toronto among a thriving community of Newfoundland immigrants.

French attended Rawlinson Public School, Harbord Collegiate, and Oakwood Collegiate. He was indifferent to books until Grade 8, when his English teacher, to punish him for talking in class, told French to sit down and read a book. The book David happened to pull off the shelf was Mark Twain’s &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. French says that by the time he finished reading it, he not only knew that he wanted to be a writer – he knew that he was one. Almost immediately he began to publish original stories and poems.

After high school, French trained as an actor. He spent a summer at the Pasadena Playhouse, and studied at various acting studios in Toronto. In the early 1960s, he played roles on stage and in CBC television dramas. Then he began writing for television. Over the next several years he wrote many half-hour dramas, including &quot;The Tender Branch&quot;, &quot;A Ring for Florie&quot;, &quot;Beckons the Dark River&quot;, &quot;Sparrow on a Monday Morning&quot;, and &quot;The Willow Harp&quot;. He also wrote episodes of the popular children’s program &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;.

==Work for the stage==

===The Mercer family play cycle===
In 1971, he became aware of a new theatre, the Tarragon in Toronto, that was producing David Freeman&#x27;s play &quot;Creeps&quot;. After seeing the play, French was so impressed that he called the director, Bill Glassco, and asked him to read a play he had been working on, &quot;Leaving Home&quot; (1972). Glasco produced the play and it filled the final slot in the Tarragon’s first season. A collaboration between the two men followed which lasted for over thirty years, with Glassco directing each of French’s premiere productions.

&quot;Leaving Home&quot; is a landmark play in Canadian theatre history. After its very successful run in Toronto in 1972, the play went on to be produced at virtually every regional theatre in the country – the first Canadian play ever to do so. It also received many international productions, including an off-Broadway run. &quot;Leaving Home&quot; is taught in high schools and universities across Canada, and is one of the most familiar of Canadian plays. It was named one of the &quot;100 Most Influential Canadian Books&quot; by the &quot;Literary Review of Canada&quot;) and one of the &quot;1,000 Essential Plays in the English Language&quot; in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Theatre&quot;. &quot;Leaving Home&quot; introduced audiences to the Mercer family, who would come to figure largely in David&#x27;s work. The Mercers, like the Frenches, were a Newfoundland family transplanted to Toronto.

&quot;Of the Fields, Lately&quot; (1973), French&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Leaving Home&quot;, also produced at the Tarragon, won the Chalmers Award for 1973. &quot;I wrote it because people kept asking me what happened to the Mercers after Ben leaves home,&quot; said French. It was adapted for CBC Television and was produced across Canada and abroad, including a critically acclaimed run in Argentina (in a Spanish translation) and a production on Broadway.

French eventually wrote five plays about the Mercer family. &quot;Salt-Water Moon&quot; (1984), the third play, is a poetic drama about the courtship of the parents, set in Newfoundland in 1926. &quot;Salt-Water Moon&quot; has had hundreds of productions since its original run. The French-language version, translated by Antonine Maillet, has been produced across Canada. &quot;Salt-Water Moon&quot; won the Canadian Authors Association Award for Drama, the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best New Play, and the Hollywood Drama-Logue Critics’ Award.

&quot;1949&quot; (1988), a fond look at the extended Mercer clan as Newfoundland prepares to join Confederation, premiered at CentreStage, and &quot;Soldier’s Heart&quot;, which explores the effect of the First World War on two generations of Mercers, was produced at the Tarragon in 2001. Toronto&#x27;s Soulpepper Theatre has done acclaimed revivals of &quot;Leaving Home&quot; and &quot;Salt-Water Moon&quot;, with a &quot;Of The Fields, Lately&quot; revival running during the summer of 2010.

===Other work===
The immensely popular backstage comedy &quot;Jitters&quot; (1979) has been regularly revived in Canada, and enjoyed a six-month run at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. Other works include the memory play &quot;That Summer&quot; (1999), which opened the Blyth Festival’s 25th Anniversary Season; the mystery-thriller &quot;Silver Dagger&quot; (1993), a finalist for the Arthur Ellis Award; &quot;One Crack Out&quot; (1975) a pool-hall drama produced in Toronto and off-Broadway, and the comedy &quot;The Riddle of the World&quot; (1981). All of his plays have been published and are in print. (Talonbooks and Anansi).

French also undertook translations of &quot;Miss Julie&quot; (August Strindberg), &quot;The Forest&quot; (Alexander Ostrovsky), and of Anton Chekhov’s &quot;The Seagull&quot;, a version of which was produced on Broadway starring Laura Linney, Ethan Hawke, Jon Voight, and Tyne Daly. French was helped by Russian scholars when preparing the latter two texts.

As a senior playwright, David mentored many aspiring writers. He was writer-in-residence at the University of Windsor (2007/08) and The University of Western Ontario (2002/03), and has done a short-term residency at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. He taught a course in playwriting each summer at the Prince Edward Island (PEI) Conservatory. He also gave Canada Council-sponsored readings from coast to coast, and often visited high schools and universities that were studying his plays. French&#x27;s work is popular with community theatre groups across North America.

David French was the first inductee in the Newfoundland Arts Hall of Honour. He received the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Medal, and the Harold, (a Toronto theatre peer award). He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2001.

He died in Toronto on December 5, 2010 from brain cancer.

<text>Pauline Gedge (born December 11, 1945) is a Canadian novelist best known for her historical fiction novels, including the best-selling &quot;Child of the Morning&quot;, &quot;The Eagle and the Raven&quot;, her fantasy novel &quot;Stargate&quot;, and her Egyptian trilogies, &quot;Lords of the Two Lands&quot; and &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot;. She also writes science fiction, fantasy and horror. Her 13 novels have sold more than six million copies in 18 languages.

Her first four novels were published with cover art by Leo and Diane Dillon. The Dillons almost never authorized their work for sale beyond that directly commissioned, but reproductions of their covers of Gedge&#x27;s novels were made available for sale via an agreement between Gedge and Diane Dillon, who met in the late 1970s.

==Personal life==
Pauline Gedge was born December 11, 1945, in Auckland, New Zealand. In 1951, the family relocated to England so her father could study for the Anglican ministry. In 1956, Gedge attended the Oxford Central School for Girls, studying chemistry, violin, piano, and recorders. In 1959, her father accepted a parish in Manitoba, and the family relocated again, this time to Canada. Gedge attended a local high school and then a boarding school while there, saying her time at the boarding school was &quot;the most dehumanizing, miserable experience&quot;. 

In 1961, Gedge began her studies at University of Manitoba Brandon College, but did not end up graduating. The family returned to New Zealand so Gedge&#x27;s sister, who was ill, could die in the country of her birth. Gedge&#x27;s father ended up accepting a parish in New Zealand and the family stayed. Gedge worked as a substitute teacher in three rural schools for a year, and in 1964, began to attend the Teacher&#x27;s Training College in Dunedin, New Zealand. She did not return to the school for a second year. 

In 1966, Gedge was married and moved to Alberta, Canada with her husband. Her first son was born in 1968, and her second son was born in 1970. She was married again in the 1980s and continued moving about Canada and writing books. She and her second husband divorced some time later, and Gedge and now lives in Edgerton, Alberta, Canada. 

== Career ==
Gedge wrote unpublished poetry for years. She tried to write contemporary mainstream fiction in the early 1970s and then gave up, turning to ancient Egypt for inspiration. She based her first published novel, &quot;Child of the Morning&quot;, on the historical figure of Hatshepsut, one of Egypt&#x27;s few female pharaohs. She wrote the novel in six weeks and went on to win the Alberta Search-for-a-New Novelist Competition in 1975.

&quot;The Eagle and the Raven&quot; received the Jean Boujassy award from the Société des Gens de Lettres in France and &quot;The Twelfth Transforming&quot; won the Writers Guild of Alberta Best Novel of the Year Award.

She has also written in other genres. &quot;Stargate&quot; is science fiction, &quot;The Covenant&quot; is contemporary horror fiction, and &quot;Scroll of Saqqara&quot; is a horror story which incorporates some fantasy elements.

Gedge&#x27;s ex-husband, Bernie Ramanauskas, helped to provide the historical research for many of her later novels.

<text>Thomas Graeme Cameron Gibson (9 August 1934 – 18 September 2019) was a Canadian novelist. He was a Member of the Order of Canada (1992), a Senior Fellow of Massey College and one of the organizers of the Writers Union of Canada (chair, 1974–75). He was also a founder of the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada, a non-profit literary organization that seeks to encourage Canada&#x27;s writing community.

==Career==
The elder son of Brigadier General Thomas Graeme Gibson, a career Army officer, and radio singer Mary (née Cameron), of Australian origin,
Gibson&#x27;s family frequently moved around during his childhood, going from Halifax to Ottawa to Toronto where he attended Upper Canada College. As an author, Gibson wrote both novels and non-fiction. His first novel, &quot;Five Legs&quot; (1969), is widely regarded as a breakthrough in Canadian experimental literature. His other novels include &quot;Communion&quot; (1971), &quot;Gentleman Death&quot; (1993), and &quot;Perpetual Motion&quot; (1982). His non-fiction included &quot;Eleven Canadian Novelists&quot; (1973) and more recently, &quot;The Bedside Book of Birds&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Bedside Book of Beasts&quot; (2009).

Gibson was awarded the Toronto Arts Award (1990) the Harbourfront Festival prize in 1993, and he was made a member of the Order of Canada.

An arts, environmental and social justice advocate, Gibson was one of the founders of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada, which recognized his contribution by establishing an award in his honour in 1991. He was involved in the formation of the Writer&#x27;s Trust of Canada and was a co-founder and president (1987–89) of PEN Canada. He also had a small acting role in the 1983 film &quot;The Wars&quot;.

His environmental advocacy was largely focused around his longtime love of birds. He was a founder and chair of the Pelee Island Bird Observatory, served on the Council of the World Wildlife Fund, and with Margaret Atwood, as co-chair of Birdlife International&#x27;s Rare Bird Club. He was a Fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, which awarded him a Gold Medal in 2015.

==Personal life==
Gibson was married to publisher Shirley Gibson until the early 1970s, and together they had two sons, Matt and Grae. He began dating novelist and poet Margaret Atwood in 1973. They moved to a semi-derelict farm near Alliston, Ontario, which they set about doing up and where according to Atwood they were making &quot;attempts at farming, writing and trying to earn enough to live&quot;. Their daughter Eleanor Jess Atwood Gibson was born there in 1976. The family returned to Toronto in 1980. Atwood and Gibson stayed together until his death in 2019.

In 2017 Gibson was diagnosed with early signs of vascular dementia. Despite having written a book on birds, he could no longer identify those he liked to watch in his garden, but said &quot;I no longer know their names, but then, they don&#x27;t know my name either&quot;. He died on 18 September 2019 in London, England, where Atwood was promoting her new book, five days after suffering a severe stroke. Atwood later said about his death that it had not been unexpected due to the vascular dementia, had been a good one—and in a good hospital, and his children had time to come and say goodbye—and that he had been &quot;declining and he had wanted to check out before he reached any further stages of that&quot;.

Following his death, the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada renamed its annual fiction award, formerly the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize, to the Atwood Gibson Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize in early 2021.

<doc id="284976" wikidata="Q7887" url="?curid=284976" title="Greiz (district)">
<text>Greiz ( ) is a Kreis (district) in the east of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the west clockwise) Saale-Holzland, Saale-Orla, district-free city Gera, the Burgenlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, Altenburger Land, and the two Saxon districts Zwickau and Vogtlandkreis.

== History ==
Historically the area of the district was part of the &quot;Vogtland&quot;, named after the title &quot;Vogt&quot; given to the local rulers in the 13th century. Only two lines of the &quot;Reuß&quot; family survived from that time, with one principality based in Greiz, and the other in Gera and Schleiz. In 1919 both were merged into the &quot;Volksstaat Reuß&quot;, which then became part of Thuringia in 1920.

A subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp was located at Berga/Elster during World War II. It was an SS joint venture, in which inmates dug tunnels and laid railway tracks for the Schwalbe V project.

The district in its current form was created on 1 July 1994, when the districts Gera-Land, Zeulenroda and the previous district Greiz were merged.

== Geography ==
In the south of the district are the mountains of the Thuringian Slate Mountains (&quot;Thüringer Schiefergebirge&quot;) and the Ore Mountains, with the river valley of the &quot;Weiße Elster&quot; going through the district from south to north.

== Coat of arms ==
Both the lion as well as the crane in the top part of the coat of arms derive from the coat of arms of the Reuß families and their principalities. In the bottom is a part of the coat of arms of Saxony, as a small part of the district belonged to the Duchies of Saxony.

==Towns and municipalities==

<doc id="284977" wikidata="Q728692" url="?curid=284977" title="You'll Never Walk Alone">
<text>&quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; is a show tune from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Carousel&quot;. In the second act of the musical, Nettie Fowler, the cousin of the protagonist Julie Jordan, sings &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; to comfort and encourage Julie when her husband, Billy Bigelow, the male lead, stabs himself with a knife whilst trying to run away after attempting a robbery with his mate Jigger and dies in her arms. The song is reprised as an epilogue in the final scene to encourage a graduation class of which Louise Bigelow (Billy and Julie&#x27;s daughter) is a member as the Starkeeper is about to give them a graduation sermon. The now invisible Billy, who has been granted the chance to return to Earth for one day in order to redeem himself, watches the ceremony and at the end of the Starkeeper&#x27;s homily is able to silently motivate Louise and Julie to join in with the song as the whole congregation unite in singing along with them urged on by the Starkeeper as he ascends to paradise.

The song is also sung at association football clubs around the world, where it is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on match day; this tradition developed at Liverpool F.C. after the chart success of the 1963 single of the song by the local Liverpool group Gerry and the Pacemakers on their album &quot;How Do You Like It?&quot;. In some areas of the United Kingdom and Europe, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; became the anthem of support for medical staff, first responders, and those in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The composition is sometimes treated by performers as a religious song, such as with the 1967 version by Elvis Presley, which was featured on his album &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; and several of his gospel albums.

==Background==
Christine Johnson, who created the role of Nettie Fowler, introduced the song in the original Broadway production. Later in the show Jan Clayton, as Julie Jordan, reprised it, with the entire cast joining in.

In the 1956 film adaptation, the song was introduced by Claramae Turner as Nettie, also the weeping Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones) tries to sing it but can&#x27;t; the song is reprised by Julie with the entire cast as the end.

==Gerry and the Pacemakers version==

In the UK, the song&#x27;s most successful cover was released in 1963 by the Liverpudlian Merseybeat group Gerry and the Pacemakers, peaking at number one on the UK Singles Chart for four consecutive weeks. The band&#x27;s version also reached the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand and on the Irish Singles Chart.

===Liverpool F.C.===
After becoming a chart hit, the song gained popularity among Liverpool F.C. fans, and quickly became the football anthem of the club, which adopted &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; as its official motto on its coat of arms. The song is sung by its supporters before the start of each home game at Anfield with the Gerry and the Pacemakers version being played over the public address system. In 2013, the 50th anniversary of the song being sung on the Kop, Simon Hart of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote, 

According to former player Tommy Smith, lead vocalist Gerry Marsden presented Liverpool manager Bill Shankly with a recording of his forthcoming cover single during a pre-season coach trip in the summer of 1963. &quot;Shanks was in awe of what he heard. ... Football writers from the local newspapers were travelling with our party and, thirsty for a story of any kind between games, filed copy back to their editors to the effect that we had adopted Gerry Marsden&#x27;s forthcoming single as the club song.&quot; The squad were subsequently invited to perform the track with the band on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; with Marsden stating, &quot;Bill came up to me. He said, &#x27;Gerry my son, I have given you a football team and you have given us a song&#x27;.&quot;
Shankly picked the song as his eighth and final selection for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on the eve of the 1965 FA Cup Final. As Liverpool fans sang &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; at Wembley during the 1965 FA Cup Final win over Leeds, commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme referred to it as &quot;Liverpool&#x27;s signature tune&quot;. Marsden told BBC Radio how, in the 1960s, the disc jockey at Anfield would play the top 10 commercial records in descending order, with the number one single played last, shortly before kickoff. Liverpool fans on the Kop would sing along, but unlike with other hit singles, once &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; dropped out of the top 10, instead of disregarding the song, supporters—chanting &#x27;Where&#x27;s our song?&#x27;—continued to sing it. In retirement, according to his granddaughter Karen Gill, Shankly would get out the gramophone and &quot;put the record on and play it, so we would hear it in the house.&quot;


In his commentary on the memorial service following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, Peter Jones recited the lyrics, which were then sung by a cathedral choir. Aretha Franklin&#x27;s recording of the song from her 1971 live album &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was played by BBC Radio 1 DJ and Liverpool fan John Peel in his first show following the disaster. In 2019, during a Take That concert at Anfield, Gerry Marsden made a guest appearance to sing the song with Gary Barlow. Reflecting on 60 years of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; as the club&#x27;s anthem, in 2023 Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp stated, &quot;Simple but powerful lyrics, a real message. Some things have changed since then [the 1960s] but obviously what it means to the people has never changed.&quot;

In 1995, the Gerry and the Pacemakers version peaked at number 34 on the Dutch Single Top 100 on the week ending March 18 and number 24 on the Dutch Top 40 on the week ending April 1. It re-entered the Irish Singles Chart in 2012, peaking at number four on the week ending September 20.

===Other teams===
The song was adopted by Scottish team Celtic after a 1966 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-final against Liverpool at Anfield, and is now sung by Celtic fans prior to every home European tie, and later by Germany&#x27;s Borussia Dortmund, which Liverpool went on to play in the cup final. When Celtic and Liverpool played in the quarterfinals of the 2002-03 UEFA Cup, Gerry Marsden performed the song at Celtic Park before both teams took the field and both sets of fans sang along.

The song has also been adopted by Dutch team FC Twente after it was officially given to them by the Anfield stadium speaker George Sephton during the last game in Diekman Stadion, before moving to the new Arke Stadion. Today, Twente fans sing the song before every home game. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, Feyenoord and SC Cambuur have adopted the song as well, with Feyenoord using the Lee Towers version from his 1976 album &quot;It&#x27;s Raining in My Heart&quot;.

Additional football teams which now use the song include 1. FSV Mainz 05, TSV 1860 Munich, Austria&#x27;s FC Admira Wacker, Belgium&#x27;s Club Brugge KV and KV Mechelen, Italy&#x27;s Genoa CFC, Japan&#x27;s FC Tokyo, Spain&#x27;s CD Lugo, and Greece&#x27;s ARIS. In ice hockey, the song has been adopted by German Deutsche Eishockey Liga side Krefeld Pinguine and Croatian Medveščak Zagreb.

Some years later, after witnessing a rendition of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; at Anfield in 2007, the President of the Spanish Olympic Committee, Alejandro Blanco, said he felt inspired to seek lyrics to his country&#x27;s wordless national anthem, the Marcha Real, ahead of Madrid&#x27;s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games.

During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, legislator Tam Yiu Chung quoted the song during a Legislative Council of Hong Kong meeting, to salute the Hong Kong Police, who had received widespread criticism for using excessive force against pro-democracy protesters. More than 2,000 Liverpool Football Club fans in Hong Kong condemned his inappropriate use of the song, comparing his support of the police action to the police actions in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, where South Yorkshire Police were found to have distorted facts relating to the unlawful killing by negligence of 97 Liverpool supporters.

On 13 March 2016, after Borussia Dortmund&#x27;s 2–0 win against 1. FSV Mainz 05 in the German Bundesliga, supporters of both teams performed the song to commemorate a Dortmund fan who died from a cardiac arrest in the stands during the game.

==The Crowd version==
A special recording of the song was made in solidarity with Bradford City following the Valley Parade fire in 1985 when 56 spectators died and many more were seriously injured. The song was performed by charity supergroup the Crowd, which featured Gerry Marsden, Paul McCartney and others, and spent two weeks at number one in the UK and Ireland in June 1985.

In April 2020, to mark 99-year old Captain Tom Moore completing the first phase of his fundraising walk during the COVID-19 pandemic, English actor, singer and broadcaster, Michael Ball sang &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; for him live on &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;. Ball said: &quot;It&#x27;s an extraordinary achievement. I&#x27;ve been trying to think of a song which encapsulates your achievement and what you have done for us.&quot; Within 24 hours, the performance was recorded, and made into a digital single featuring the NHS Voices of Care Choir, and Moore&#x27;s spoken words. It was released by Decca Records on April 17, with all proceeds going to NHS Charities Together. The duo appeared on Zoe Ball&#x27;s Radio 2 show, where they both performed the song.

===Commercial performance===
On April 19, 2020, the song went straight to number one in the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;The EE Official Big Top 40&quot; chart, selling almost 36,000 copies in its first 48 hours. On April 21, 2020, the song was the &quot;biggest trending song&quot; as measured by the Official Charts Company. On April 24, 2020, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, with combined chart sales of 82,000 making it the fastest-selling single of 2020 so far and making Moore – six days short of his one hundredth birthday – the oldest person to achieve that position and meaning that he was at number one on his 100th birthday, beating the previous record-holder Tom Jones, who was 68 years old when a Comic Relief rendition of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; reached number one in 2009.

<doc id="284978" wikidata="Q235521" url="?curid=284978" title="Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone">
<text>Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (Alice Mary Victoria Augusta Pauline; 25 February 1883 – 3 January 1981) was a member of the British royal family. She was the longest-lived Princess of the Blood Royal, and one of the longest-lived British royals. Princess Alice was the last surviving grandchild of Queen Victoria, the sister-in-law of Queen Mary, and the aunt to Kings Edward VIII and George VI and also a great-aunt of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Early life==
Princess Alice was born on 25 February 1883 at Windsor Castle, the only daughter of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany (the youngest of the four sons of Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort) and his wife Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont. Her younger brother and only sibling, Prince Charles Edward (later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), was born on 19 July 1884. 

She was baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on 26 March 1883, and named Alice after her late paternal aunt Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse. Her godparents were: Queen Victoria (her paternal grandmother); the German Empress, for whom Alice&#x27;s paternal aunt Princess Beatrice stood proxy; the King of the Netherlands (her maternal uncle), for whom the Dutch Ambassador Count Charles van Bylandt stood proxy; the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (her paternal uncle), represented by his brother-in-law Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh; the Princess of Waldeck and Pyrmont (her maternal grandmother); the Prince of Wales (her paternal uncle); the Princess Royal (the German Crown Princess – her paternal aunt) represented by her sister-in-law the Princess of Wales; Prince Wilhelm of Württemberg (her maternal uncle), represented by his cousin the Duke of Teck; the Hereditary Princess of Bentheim and Steinfurt (her maternal aunt), for whom her paternal aunt Princess Christian stood proxy; and the Duchess of Cambridge (her grandmother&#x27;s aunt), represented by her daughter the Duchess of Teck. She was confirmed at the Royal Memorial Church of St George, Cannes, in 1898 with Queen Victoria present.

When she was four years old, a burglar broke into Clarence House through Princess Alice&#x27;s bedroom window on the first floor, having used a ladder from a nearby farmhouse. He was followed by two accomplices, but a scream from Princess Alice&#x27;s nanny alerted everyone and made them flee. Princess Alice&#x27;s mother tried to calm her by telling her it had been Father Christmas.

Princess Alice was one of the carriers of the gene for haemophilia which originated with Queen Victoria. Princess Alice inherited the gene from her father, who died from the disease when she was one year old.

==Marriage and family==

On 10 February 1904, at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, Princess Alice of Albany married her second cousin once removed Prince Alexander of Teck, the brother-in-law of the Prince of Wales (later George V). Alice was attended by five bridesmaids, all cousins: Princesses Margaret and Patricia of Connaught, Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Princess Mary of Wales and Princess Mary of Teck (the latter two also the groom&#x27;s nieces). Alice and her husband were both descended from King George III. They had three children:
* Princess May of Teck (23 January 1906 – 29 May 1994), later Lady May Cambridge; married Sir Henry Abel Smith in 1931, had issue.
* Prince Rupert of Teck (24 April 1907 – 15 April 1928), later Viscount Trematon; died in a car accident.
* Prince Maurice Francis George of Teck (29 March 1910 – 14 September 1910); died at five months old.

King George V granted her husband the Earldom of Athlone in 1917, during the First World War, following the royal family&#x27;s relinquishing of German titles. Following the Earl&#x27;s retirement from military service after the war, the couple moved to Clock House within Kensington Palace, the grace and favour apartment that had previously been occupied by Alice&#x27;s mother; in 1923 they also acquired a country house, Brantridge Park in West Sussex.

Princess Alice was godmother to Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, who is the granddaughter of her first cousin on her mother&#x27;s side, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.

==South Africa, Canada and Second World War==

The Earl was appointed Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, and served from 1924–31. Princess Alice accompanied him and was the Vicereine during that period. Lord Athlone and Princess Alice had a coastal beach house constructed at Muizenberg, which still stands today and is one of South Africa&#x27;s national monuments. The Cape Town suburb of Athlone was named in honour of the Governor-General; apart from the beach house and the preserved Class GL &quot;Garratt&quot; steam locomotive &quot;Princess Alice&quot; in the Outeniqua Transport Museum, it is the only physical reminder of the Athlones&#x27; residence at the Cape.

On the sudden death of the popular Lord Tweedsmuir in 1940, Canada found itself without a Governor General in time of war. Despite the longstanding intention of Canadian governments to appoint Canadian nationals as governors general—Australia had already appointed an Australian national, Sir Isaac Isaacs, as its governor general in 1931—the royal family had garnered vast public support during the royal tour of 1939. As Queen Mary&#x27;s brother and a former governor general of another Dominion, Lord Athlone seemed a satisfactory candidate, and the Canadian prime minister (W. L. Mackenzie King) advised the King to appoint him.

Princess Alice accompanied her husband to Canada where he served as Governor General from 1940 to 1946, residing primarily at Rideau Hall in Ottawa. Their three grandchildren, Anne, Richard, and Elizabeth, lived with them in Canada for the duration of the war.

Upon taking up his post, The Earl immediately made himself active in the support of the war effort, travelling across the country and focusing much of his attention on the troops, either those training at military facilities or those injured and in hospital. Viewing his position as governor general as a link between Canadians and their monarch, Athlone also communicated in speeches that the King stood with them in their fight against Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime.

As vicereine of Canada, Princess Alice also supported the war effort by serving as Honorary Commandant of the Women&#x27;s Royal Canadian Naval Service, Honorary Air Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Force Women&#x27;s Division and president of the nursing division of the St John Ambulance Brigade.

In 1944, the &quot;Princess Alice Barracks Cabin&quot; at Britannia Bay provided a summer retreat for Royal Canadian Air Force Women&#x27;s Division personnel based in Ottawa. The cabin was located near the Britannia Boating Club&#x27;s facilities for tennis, dancing and boating. Rented from the King&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Guild of Ottawa, the cabin featured 60 beds, a separate cookhouse and dining pavilion. The cabin had served previously as a Fresh Air Cottage for mothers and undernourished children.

The war was brought close to home for the Athlones also because many of those belonging to displaced European royal families sought refuge in Canada, and resided at or near the royal and viceroyal residence, Rideau Hall. Among the royal guests were Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway; Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Luxembourg; King Peter of Yugoslavia; King George of Greece; Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma (Austria) and her daughters; as well as Queen Wilhelmina and her daughter, Princess Juliana. Further, in December 1941, British prime minister Winston Churchill arrived at Rideau Hall, where he presided over British Cabinet meetings via telephone from his bed.

The viceregal couple also played host at Quebec City to prime minister Mackenzie King, as well as Churchill and United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt, who all gathered to take part in what would become known as the Quebec Conferences, with the first taking place between 17 and 24 August 1943 at the viceregal residence in La Citadelle, and the second occurring from 12 to 16 September 1944 at the Château Frontenac. Photos of the Earl with Roosevelt, Churchill and Mackenzie King on the ramparts of the Citadel during the Quebec Conference were widely published at the time.

It was at these meetings that the four men discussed the Allied strategies that would eventually lead to victory over Nazi Germany and Japan. When Germany fell on 8 May 1945 and Japan on 15 August of the same year, Athlone led the national celebrations held on Parliament Hill and elsewhere. He thereafter spoke in speeches about Canada&#x27;s future being marked not by war but by a strong role in reconstruction and reconciliation.

During their time in Canada, the Athlones also supported various charitable and social events, and mounted a number of tobogganing parties and skating lessons on the grounds of Rideau Hall, as well as skiing in Gatineau Park. Before the couple departed from Canada at the end of Athlone&#x27;s time as the King&#x27;s representative, he left as a legacy the Athlone-Vanier Engineering Fellowship, awarded by the Engineering Institute of Canada.

==Public life==

In her lifetime, Princess Alice carried out many engagements and took part in many of the activities the royal family were involved in. Apart from her normal duties as vicereine of South Africa and then Canada, she attended the coronations of four British monarchs: Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II, as well as the investiture of the Dutch queen Juliana. She was also the Colonel-in-Chief of two British Army units and one Rhodesian Army unit. During the Second World War, she was Honorary Air Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Force Women&#x27;s Division. In 1950, she became the first Chancellor of the University of the West Indies (then the University College of the West Indies). As Chancellor, she visited the university every year, staying as a guest of Sir Kenneth Blackburne, Governor-General of Jamaica, and his wife.

From the 1930s to the 1960s, she was Chair of the Council (governing body) of Royal Holloway College, University of London. With her husband, daughter and son-in-law, Princess Alice represented the King at the 1937 wedding of Juliana of the Netherlands to Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld.

The princess and her husband visited Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in the winter of 1938. She was the first member of the British royal family to visit the country and the only one to meet King Abdulaziz. Their nephew Lord Frederick Cambridge accompanied them on the visits. In Saudi Arabia Princess Alice visited Riyadh, Hofuf and Dammam, and met Noura bint Abdul Rahman, sister of the King and other members of the Saudi royal family.

In 1966, Princess Alice published her memoirs, &quot;For My Grandchildren&quot;.

==Later life and death==
At the end of the Second World War, the American Military Government in Bavaria, under the command of General George S. Patton, arrested and imprisoned Alice&#x27;s brother, Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (who served as a member of the Reichstag from 1937 to 1945), because of his actions as a Nazi supporter during the war. Alice, learning of her brother&#x27;s incarceration, came to Germany with her husband to plead with his American captors for his release. They would not yield, and in 1946 he was sentenced by a de-nazification court, heavily fined and almost bankrupted.

The Earl of Athlone died in 1957 at Kensington Palace in London. Princess Alice lived there until her death, dying in her sleep on 3 January 1981, aged 97 years and 313 days. , she remains the longest-living Princess of the Blood Royal and is fourth on the list of longest-living members of the British royal family, just ahead of Queen Elizabeth II and surpassed only by the Queen&#x27;s aunt, mother and husband, all of whom married into the royal family.

Her funeral in St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle was attended by all members of the royal family. She is buried alongside her husband and son in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, directly behind the Royal Mausoleum containing the remains of her grandparents, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Her son, daughter and son-in-law are also buried close by.

At the time of her death she was great-aunt to the King of Sweden and the Queen of the United Kingdom. She lived through six reigns: those of Victoria (grandmother), Edward VII (uncle), George V (brother-in-law and cousin), Edward VIII as well as George VI (nephews) and Elizabeth II (grandniece).

Her will was sealed in London after her death in 1981. Her estate was valued at £182,185 (or £567,100 in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

<text>The Place de la Bastille () is a square in Paris where the Bastille prison once stood, until the storming of the Bastille and its subsequent physical destruction between 14 July 1789 and 14 July 1790 during the French Revolution. No vestige of the prison remains.

The square straddles 3 &quot;arrondissements&quot; of Paris, namely the 4th, 11th and 12th. The square and its surrounding areas are normally called simply &quot;Bastille&quot;. The July Column (&quot;Colonne de Juillet&quot;) which commemorates the events of the July Revolution (1830) stands at the center of the square. Other notable features include the Bastille Opera, the Bastille subway station and a section of the Canal Saint Martin. Prior to 1984, the former Bastille railway station stood where the opera house now stands.
The square is home to concerts and similar events. The north-eastern area of Bastille is busy at night with its many cafés, bars, night clubs, and concert halls. As a consequence of its historical significance, the square is often the site or point of departure of political demonstrations, including the massive anti-CPE demonstration of 28 March 2006.

== History ==
=== Early history of the Bastille ===

The Bastille was built between 1370 and 1383 during the reign of King Charles V as part of the defenses of Paris; the structure was converted into a state prison in the 17th century by Richelieu, who was king Louis XIII&#x27;s chief minister. At that time it primarily housed political prisoners, but also religious prisoners, &quot;seditious&quot; writers, and young rakes held at the request of their families. It began to acquire a poor reputation when it became the main prison for those taken under lettres de cachet issued by the King of France.

By the late 18th century, the building was made up of eight close-packed towers, around 24 m (80 ft) high, surrounding two courtyards and the armoury. The prisoners were held within the 5-7 story towers, each having a room around 4.6 m (15 ft) across and containing various articles of furniture. The infamous cachots (dungeons), the oozing, vermin-infested subterranean cells were no longer in use, since the respective reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, who both worked on reforming the penal system in France. The governor of the prison was given a daily allowance per prisoner, the amount depending on their status—from nineteen livres per diem for scientists and academics down to three for commoners. Although its prisoners&#x27; conditions were better than in many other prisons in France, including the dreaded Bicêtre in Paris, popular literary accounts focused on the Bastille as a place of horror and oppression and a symbol of autocratic cruelty.

=== Storming of the Bastille ===
The confrontation between the commoners and the Ancien Régime ultimately led to the people of Paris storming the Bastille on 14 July 1789, following several days of disturbances. At this point, the prison was nearly empty, with only seven inmates: four counterfeiters, two madmen, and a young aristocrat who had displeased his father. The regular garrison consisted of about 80 &#x27;invalides&#x27; (veteran soldiers no longer capable of service in the field) under Governor Bernard-René de Launay. They had however been reinforced by a detachment of 32 grenadiers from one of the Swiss mercenary regiments summoned to Paris by the Monarchy shortly before 14 July. 

A crowd of around 600 people gathered outside around mid-morning, calling for the surrender of the prison, the removal of the guns and the release of the arms and gunpowder. Two people chosen to represent those gathered were invited into the fortress and slow negotiations began.

In the early afternoon, the crowd broke into the undefended outer courtyard and the chains on the drawbridge to the inner courtyard were cut. A spasmodic exchange of gunfire began; in mid-afternoon the crowd was reinforced by mutinous Gardes Françaises of the Royal Army and two cannons. De Launay ordered a ceasefire; despite his surrender demands being refused, he capitulated and the victors swept in to liberate the fortress at around 5:30.

=== Later history ===


On 16 June 1792, the area occupied by the Bastille was turned into a square celebrating liberty, and a column would be erected there. The first stone was laid by Palloy; however, construction never took place, and a fountain was built instead in 1793.

In 1808, as part of several urban improvement projects for Paris, Napoléon planned to have a monument in the shape of an elephant built here, the Elephant of the Bastille. It was designed to be 24 m (78 ft) in height, and to be cast from the bronze of cannons taken from the Spanish. Access to the top was to be achieved by a stairway set in one of the legs. However, only a full-scale plaster model was built. Victor Hugo immortalized the monument in the novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot; where it is used as a shelter by Gavroche. The monument was demolished in 1846.

In 1833, Louis-Philippe decided to build the July Column as originally planned in 1792. It was inaugurated in 1840.

The area was damaged during the events of the Paris Commune in spring 1871.

== The area today ==
The current Place de la Bastille is located on the former fort&#x27;s site. In addition to the July Column, it is also home to the Opéra Bastille. The large ditch (&quot;fossé&quot;) behind the former fort has been transformed into a marina for pleasure boats, the Bassin de l&#x27;Arsenal, to the south, which is bordered by the Boulevard de la Bastille. To the north, a covered canal, the Canal Saint-Martin, extends north from the marina beneath the vehicular roundabout that borders the location of the fort, and then continues for about 4.4 kilometers to the Place de la Bataille-de-Stalingrad.

On Thursdays and Sundays, a large, open-air market occupies part of the park to the north of the Place de la Bastille, along the Boulevard Richard-Lenoir. Consumers can find fresh fruit, fish, meat, cheese and bread along with clothing and typical flea market items.

Some undemolished remains of one tower of the fort were discovered during excavation for the Métro (rail mass-transit system) in 1899, and were moved to a park (the Square Henri-Galli) a few hundred metres away, where they are displayed today. The original outline of the fort is also marked on the pavement of streets and pathways that pass over its former location, in the form of special paving stones. A café and some other businesses largely occupy the location of the fort, and the Rue Saint-Antoine passes directly over it as it opens onto the roundabout of the Bastille.

<text>University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (University of the Sciences or USciences), previously Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (PCPS), was a private university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On June 1, 2022, it officially merged into Saint Joseph&#x27;s University.

==History==
===19th century===

University of the Sciences traced its history to February 1821, when 68 apothecaries met in Philadelphia&#x27;s Carpenters&#x27; Hall to establish improved scientific standards and to develop programs to train more competent apprentices and students. They formalized their new association through a constitution, which declared their intent to establish a school of pharmacy to enhance their vocation and to &quot;guard the drug market from the introduction of spurious, adulterated, deteriorated or otherwise mischievous articles, which are too frequently forced into it&quot;. Classes began nearly immediately, making Philadelphia College of Pharmacy (PCP) the first institution of higher learning in the United States dedicated to the field of pharmacy.

In 1825, PCP began publishing the first academic journal in the United States dedicated to pharmacy. For the period 1825–1834, the periodical was issued under the title &quot;Journal of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy&quot;. After 1834, the journal continued to be published by PCP, but under the revised title &quot;American Journal of Pharmacy&quot;.

Although matriculation was originally limited to men, the college became coeducational in 1876, when Dr. Clara Marshall, later dean of the Woman&#x27;s Medical College of Pennsylvania, began attending lectures there. In 1883, Dr. Susan Hayhurst was conferred a degree in pharmacy, thus becoming the college&#x27;s first female graduate, and the first woman in the United States to be granted a degree in pharmacy. In 1889, Dr. Hayhurst applied for and received a license to operate a retail drug business. By 1898, she was serving as the director of the pharmaceutical department of the Women&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Reports at the time noted she was credited with being &quot;the first regularly graduated woman pharmacist in the world who took up the business in a practical way after graduation.&quot;

===20th century===
In 1916, PCP substantially expanded its student enrollment and scope via a merger with another prominent Philadelphia pharmacy school. In April of that year, a series of letters among principals associated with three well-known Philadelphia medical schools—the University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Medical College, and the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia indicated they were discussing a merger. By June 1916, an agreement had been reached to consolidate those schools under common management.

The Medico-Chirurgical College&#x27;s assets included its schools of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, and upon completion of the merger, PCP and Penn began discussions about Penn&#x27;s newly acquired department of pharmacy. After some negotiation, Penn agreed to divest, and PCP agreed to absorb, Medico-Chirurgical College&#x27;s School of Pharmacy. The merger combined the student bodies of both schools under the auspices of PCP. All of PCP&#x27;s board of directors, administrators, and teachers were retained, and the former dean of the Medico-Chirurgical Pharmacy School was added to the PCP staff as associate dean. PCP&#x27;s president at the time, Howard B. French, noted in his statement of August 19, 1916, announcing the consolidation, that “…after careful consideration, it was decided that it would be better, in the interest of and for promoting higher pharmaceutical education in the city of Philadelphia, that the Medico-Chirurgical department of pharmacy should be consolidated with Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, the oldest and largest institution of its kind in the United States.”

While PCP initially emphasized the biological and chemical sciences as mainstays of the pharmacy curriculum, it later instituted separate curricula in three other areas: bacteriology, biology, and chemistry. In 1920, to reflect its broader scope, the institution changed its name to Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, with state authorization to grant not only the baccalaureate degree but also the master&#x27;s and doctorate in all four disciplines.

Over the next 75 years, the college evolved and expanded, adding courses to its core curriculum, as well as courses to enhance the role of the humanities and social sciences in its science-based curricula. Primarily a commuter campus in its early days, the institution gradually transformed into one in which residential life and extracurricular activities played increasing roles in student development.

In February 1997, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved the institution&#x27;s application for university status. The following year the institution officially changed its name to the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USP), to reflect its broad spectrum of new health and science programs.

The same year, USP doubled the size of its campus when it acquired an adjacent, vacant industrial site—the home of the original Breyers Ice Cream factory, which closed its Philadelphia operation in the early 1990s.

===21st century===
The additional space allowed the university to add a 1,000-seat event gymnasium, recreation gymnasium, natatorium, fitness areas, a 1/10 mile indoor track, and a new three-story, 78,000 sq. ft. academic building, the McNeil Science and Technology Center, which was a mixed-use facility housing classrooms, lecture halls, and teaching and research laboratories, was officially dedicated in September 2006. Named after alumnus Robert L. McNeil Jr., former chairman and CEO of McNeil Laboratories (now part of Johnson &amp; Johnson), it serves as home to the school&#x27;s computer science, physics, biological sciences, and bioinformatics departments.

In 2010, the university adjusted its name by dropping &quot;in Philadelphia&quot; from common usage (though the phrase remains a part of its registered name). According to the institution&#x27;s president at the time, Philip P. Gerbino, &quot;This shorter convention helps on the web, when we communicate to our students, and when we communicate to our prospective students and their families.&quot;

In addition to referencing itself simply as University of the Sciences, the university also replaced the acronym, &quot;USP&quot;, with the abbreviation, &quot;USciences&quot;. Not only was this a more descriptive name, but it also helped eliminate ambiguity between the school and a primary standards organization in the pharmaceutical field, United States Pharmacopeia, well known for its USP label.

Four years later, in 2014, the institution added to its campus another new 3-story building, known as the Integrated Professional Education Complex (IPEX). Housing clinical spaces, exam rooms, and simulation labs in a 57,000 sq. ft. space, the IPEX gives students from a variety of disciplines the opportunity to learn in a hands-on environment as well as in the classroom. In 2019, the university opened the Living &amp; Learning Commons, a mixed-use residence hall with classroom, retail, living, and learning spaces.

In 2017 the university launched a marketing campaign after experiencing five years of declining enrollment. The following year the incoming freshman class increased but not enough to offset a $4.5 million budget deficit. Some programs were phased out, staff positions eliminated, and athletic programs re-evaluated. In December 2020 the university&#x27;s credit rating was downgraded due to &quot;unstainable&quot; withdrawals from its endowment funds to pay debt obligations.

In 2020, the University of the Sciences launched USciences Online, a division of the university dedicated to providing degree and certificate programs through fully online learning.

In 2021, the University of the Sciences signed a formal Letter of Intent to begin exploratory merger conversations with Saint Joseph&#x27;s University. On June 9, 2021, the universities announced formal merger proceedings. In March 2022 the merger was approved by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The merger became effective on June 1, and as of December 31 USciences ceased to have degree granting authority.

===Historic contributions===

First created in 1820, the &quot;United States Pharmacopeia&quot; (USP) established, and has delineated since that date, the standards for manufacturing drugs across America. For the first decade, it was written by medical practitioners. However, according to the Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association, &quot;at the 1830 [U.S. Pharmacopeial] convention, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy presented for consideration &#x27;a complete revised copy of the Pharmacopeia elaborated with ability and great industry, and the Committee accepted, after deliberate examination, nearly all of the suggestions&#x27; (U.S.P. IX, X); and thus was paved the way for the representation of pharmacists in all subsequent revisions.&quot; PCP faculty members were instrumental in its continued development and served as editors for more than a hundred years.

Later, PCP professors Franklin Bache and George B. Wood compiled a comprehensive commentary on drugs, &quot;The Dispensatory of the United States of America&quot;, which was first published in 1833. Like the &quot;Pharmacopeia&quot;, the &quot;Dispensatory&quot; was authored and edited for more than a hundred years by successive generations of faculty at the college.

William Procter Jr., often described as &quot;the father of American pharmacy&quot;, was a PCP professor from 1846 to 1874, as well as serving as an officer of the board. He and Daniel B. Smith were instrumental in the founding of the American Pharmaceutical Association, the national professional society of pharmacists. Founded and organized in Philadelphia on October 6, 1852, it is now called the American Pharmacists Association (APhA)—the first-established and largest professional association of pharmacists in the United States. The more than 60,000 current members of APhA include practicing pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, pharmacy students, pharmacy technicians and others interested in advancing the profession.

In 1868, John M. Maisch, PCP professor (1866–1893) and dean (1879–1893), proposed the creation of a Pharmaceutical Board to be appointed by the governor of each state. He also established the term &quot;registered pharmacist&quot; to identify those who satisfied each Board&#x27;s requirements. Soon after, Maisch began to share his proposal with each governor, and, by 1878, nine states had adopted pharmacy laws that licensed pharmacists. The trend continued, and every state now has a Board of Pharmacy which regulates the practice of pharmacy.

In 1885, PCP professor Joseph P. Remington published &quot;The Practice of Pharmacy&quot;, which soon became established as the standard text in the field. Later renamed &quot;Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy&quot;, this comprehensive reference work remains widely used throughout the world. The 23rd edition was published in October 2020 jointly by Academic Press and University of the Sciences.

==Academics==

===Colleges===

The university operated four colleges that offered more than 30 certificate- and degree-granting programs:
* Philadelphia College of Pharmacy offered courses in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Business, and Pharmacy Practice and Administration. The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy was the nation&#x27;s first school of pharmacy.
* Samson College of Health Sciences focused its coursework on Kinesiology, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Physician Assistant Studies.
* Misher College of Arts and Sciences provided programs for Behavioral and Social Sciences, Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Humanities, and Math, Physics and Statistics.
* Mayes College of Healthcare Business and Policy offered advanced degrees related to the business of health policy and public health. It was dissolved in 2018 and incorporated into the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy.

===Accreditation and approved credential levels===

From 1962, University of the Sciences had been continuously accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with the following credential levels currently included in its accreditation scope:
* Postsecondary award (&lt; 1 year)
* Bachelor&#x27;s Degree or Equivalent
* Post-baccalaureate Certificate
* Master&#x27;s Degree or Equivalent
* Doctor&#x27;s Degree - Professional Practice
* Doctor&#x27;s Degree- Research/Scholarship
In addition, a number of individual programs within USciences were offered under the auspices of specialized accrediting bodies in appropriate disciplines.

==Campus==

The USciences campus covers approximately 24 acres of urban landscape in the section of West Philadelphia known as University City, which also encompasses the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. It is bordered on one side by Clark Park and on another by The Woodlands, an historic cemetery that now serves as a large urban park with walking and bicycle trails. The campus comprises 23 buildings, including academic halls, laboratories, mixed-use and dedicated residence halls, as well as open spaces and athletic venues. The oldest building, Griffith Hall, was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in May 2024.

In September 2022, the interim president of St. Joseph&#x27;s informed the university community that all former USciences undergraduate programs would be transitioned to the main Hawk Hill campus. Graduate health sciences programs would be consolidated into the southwest section of the University City campus. However in February 2024 St. Joesph&#x27;s announced their intention to sell the entire University City campus. After having failed to find a single buyer for the entire campus, twelve individual properties were for sale as of January 2025.

===Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy===
The Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy, located in Griffith Hall, houses artifacts, objects and records associated with pharmacology, pharmaceutical manufacturing and the practice of pharmacy, as well as the history of USciences. Its permanent collection ranges from ceramic and glass apothecary jars, mortars and pestles, and tools and instruments for drug preparation, to pharmacy and drug advertising items, nursing and orthopedic equipment and paintings and sculpture. The Samson Center has also become home to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals&#x27;s artifacts and archives.

===The J. W. England Library===
The library of the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia was formed in 1821 at the second meeting of the board of trustees and has been collecting significant works in pharmaceutical science since its inception. In 1973, the library moved into its present quarters, the free-standing Joseph W. England Library. Small but specialized, the collection is particularly strong in pharmacy, pharmacognosy, pharmaceutics and foreign drug compendia. Other areas of specialization include toxicology, pharmacology and physical therapy. In total, the library housed more than 470,000 volumes, with an annual circulation of approximately 5,680.

The library was also a member of the Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM), which is administered under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Among its collection were the holdings of the Leopold Helfand Rare Book and Archives Room, which include seventeenth and eighteenth-century botanicals, books once belonging to Benjamin Franklin and Sir Isaac Newton, as well as the theses of Dr. Eli Lilly, Sir Henry S. Wellcome and Silas M. Burroughs, written in their own hand. Since the university and its graduates were of interest to anyone researching the origins of the pharmaceutical industry. As of January 2024 the library had closed and St. Joseph&#x27;s planned to vacate the building by the end of the 2024-2025 academic year.

==Notable alumni==
Graduates of University of the Sciences include the first woman conferred a pharmacy degree in the U.S., as well as founders of, or executives at, what would become six of the world&#x27;s leading pharmaceutical companies:

* Frederick Gutekunst (Class of 1853) – photographer
* John Wyeth (Class of 1854) – founder of John Wyeth and Brother, which became Wyeth LLC, now a part of Pfizer.
* William R. Warner (Class of 1856) – founded a drugstore in Philadelphia the same year he graduated that became Warner Pharmaceuticals when he invented a tablet coating process. His company merged with Lambert Pharmaceuticals in 1955 to form Warner-Lambert, now a part of Pfizer.
* Sir Henry Wellcome (Class of 1874) – co-founder of Burroughs Wellcome and Company in England, which is now part of GlaxoSmithKline.
* Silas M. Burroughs (Class of 1877) – co-founder of Burroughs Wellcome and Company, which is now part of GlaxoSmithKline.
* Josiah K. Lilly Sr. (Class of 1882) and his son, Eli Lilly (Class of 1907) – who served successively as president of Eli Lilly and Company, which was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly, Josiah&#x27;s father and the younger Eli&#x27;s grandfather.
* Dr. Susan Hayhurst (Class of 1883) – longtime head of the pharmaceutical department at the Woman&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia and the first woman to receive a pharmacy degree in the United States
* Gerald F. Rorer (Class of 1931) – president of William H. Rorer, Inc., which was founded by his father, the company&#x27;s namesake. It is now part of Sanofi.
* Robert L. McNeil Jr. (Class of 1938) – chairman and CEO of McNeil Laboratories Inc., now part of Johnson &amp; Johnson. A campus building named after him opened in 2006.

==Athletics==
USciences&#x27; athletic teams were known as the Devils. The university was a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference (CACC) from 1999–2000 until their final season in the 2021–22 academic year. Following their merger with Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, USciences&#x27; teams would since merge with the Division I Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hawks team programs.

USciences competed in 12 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, tennis, and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

The baseball team participated in the Bill Giles Invitational tournament for Division II teams in the Philadelphia area. In 2019, the Devils made it to the championship, losing to the Wilmington University Wildcats by a score of 7–3.

<doc id="284998" wikidata="Q226062" url="?curid=284998" title="Chevrolet Impala">
<text>The Chevrolet Impala () is a full-size car that was built by Chevrolet for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and 2000 to 2020. The Impala was Chevrolet&#x27;s popular flagship passenger car and was among the better-selling American-made automobiles in the United States.

For its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Chevrolet Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Chevrolet Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet&#x27;s most popular full-sized model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revised as a 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Chevrolet Caprice Classic sedan.

In 2000, the Impala was reintroduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive car. In February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked No. 1 among Affordable Large Cars in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s rankings. When the 10th generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the 9th generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. During that time, both versions were sold in the United States and Canada. The 10th-generation Impala was also sold in the Middle East and South Korea.

==Origin==
The Impala name was first used for the full-sized 1956 General Motors Motorama show car that bore Corvette-like design cues, especially the grille. It was named Impala after the graceful African antelope, which was used as the car&#x27;s logo. Painted emerald green metallic, with a white interior, the Impala concept car featured hardtop styling. Clare MacKichan&#x27;s design team, along with designers from Pontiac, started to establish basic packaging and dimensions for their shared 1958 General Motors &quot;A&quot; body in June. The first styling sketch that directly influenced the finished Chevrolet automobile was seen by General Motors Styling Vice President Harley Earl in October. Seven months later, the basic design was developed.
== First generation (1958) ==
For 1958, GM was promoting its 50th year of business, and introduced anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile Starfire 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

The Impala was introduced for the 1958 model year as a top-of-the-line Bel Air in 2-door hardtops and convertibles. From the windshield (A) pillar rearward, the 1958 Bel Air Impala differed structurally from the lower-priced Chevrolet models. Hardtops had a slightly shorter greenhouse and longer rear deck. The wheelbase of the Impala was longer than the lower-priced models, although the overall length was identical. Interiors held a two-spoke steering wheel and color-keyed door panels with brushed aluminum trim. No other series included a convertible.

The 1958 Chevrolet models were longer, lower, and wider than their predecessors. The 1958 model year was the first with dual headlamps. The tailfins of the 1957 were replaced by deeply sculptured rear fenders. Impalas had three taillights each side, while lesser models had two and wagons just one. The Impalas included crossed-flag insignias above the side moldings, as well as bright rocker moldings and dummy rear-fender scoops.

The standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated &quot;X&quot;. Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis; the body structure was also strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall. However, this frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side-impact crash as a traditional perimeter frame.

A coil spring suspension replaced the previous year&#x27;s rear leaf springs, and an air-ride system was optional.

A engine was the standard V8, with ratings of , , and with optional Rochester Ramjet fuel injection. Two versions of Chevrolet&#x27;s V8, its first big-block, were also optional, producing with a single four-barrel carburetor and with three two-barrels.

In total, 55,989 Impala convertibles and 125,480 coupes were built representing 15% of Chevrolet production. The 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air Impala helped Chevrolet regain the number-one production spot in this recession year.

== Second generation (1959–1960) ==
As part of a GM economy move, the 1959 Chevrolet Impala was redesigned to share bodyshells with lower-end Buicks, Oldsmobiles, and Pontiacs. Using a new X-frame chassis, the roof line was 3 inches lower, bodies were 2 inches wider, the wheelbase was 1-1/2 inches longer, and curb weight increased. Flattened tailfins protruded outward, rather than upward. The taillights were a large &quot;teardrop&quot; design at each side, and two slim-wide, non-functional front air intake scoops were added just above the grille.

The Impala became a separate series, adding a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan to the two-door Sport Coupe and convertible and a five-door station wagon. Sport Coupes featured a shortened roof line and wrap-over back window. The standard engine was an I6, while the base V8 was the carryover , at . Optional were a 283 cu in with and V8 up to . Standard were front and rear armrests, an electric clock, dual sliding sun visors, and crank-operated front vent windows. A contoured hooded instrument panel held deep-set gauges. A six-way power seat was a new option, as was &quot;Speedminder,&quot; which allowed the driver to set a needle at a specific speed, which triggered a buzzer when exceeded.

The 1960 Impala models reinstated three round taillights on each side, and a white band running along the rear fenders.

Seven versions of the 283-cu in and 348-cu in V8s were offered: the carbureted 283 Turbo-Fire could have either . The 348 was available in with a Special Super Turbo-Thrust with triple two-barrel carburetors, 11.25:1 compression ratio, and dual exhausts. Fuel injection was no longer an option on full-size Chevrolets. New to the options list was cruise control. Production was 490,000 units.

===Exports===
Right-hand drive cars were made in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, for New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa and assembled locally from CKD or SKD kits. The right-hand drive dashboard was a mirror image of the 1959 Chevrolet panel and shared with equivalent right-hand drive Pontiac models. Australian models were assembled by hand on the GMH Holden assembly lines. The Australian Impala was the first American post-war import to come standard with a V8 engine.

== Third generation (1961–1964) ==
=== 1961 ===
The Impala was restyled on the GM B platform for the first time for 1961. The new body styling was more trim and boxy than the 1958–1960 models. Sport Coupe models featured a &quot;bubbleback&quot; roof line style for 1961, and a unique model, the 2-door pillared sedan, was available for 1961 only. It was rarely ordered. A &quot;Super Sport&quot; (SS) option debuted for 1961. This was also the last year the top station wagon model would have the Nomad name. Power brakes were $43.

=== 1962 ===

The 1962 model featured new &quot;C&quot; pillar styling for all models except the 4-door hardtop. Sport Coupe models now featured the &quot;convertible roof&quot; styling, shared with other GM &quot;B&quot; full-size hardtop coupe, which proved popular. The &quot;overhang&quot; roof style of the sedans was replaced with a wider &quot;C&quot; pillar with wraparound rear window.

Engine choices for 1962 began as previously with 1962 being the final year for the 235 I6. along with the small-block 283 fitted with a two barrel carburetor. The 283 was also enlarged to , offered in two versions, one with and one with . available only with a manual transmission. Due to reliability problems, the optional Turboglide automatic transmission was discontinued, leaving Powerglide the only automatic transmission available until 1965. A new radio was optional.

The Beach Boys produced a hit single, &quot;409&quot;, referring to the Chevrolet, which became an iconic song for these cars.

Impalas again featured premium interior appointments, plusher seats could be done by the dealerships on customer request. And more chrome trim outside, including a full-width aluminum-and-chrome panel to house the triple-unit taillight assembly. Super Sport (SS) models featured that panel in a special engine-turned aluminum, which was also used to fill the side moldings, making the SS more distinctive in appearance. The Impala also gained the top trim station wagon body design, in place of the Chevrolet Nomad model. However, unlike the passenger cars, Impala wagons had dual-unit taillights.

=== 1963 ===

The 1963 Impala featured rectilinear styling with an engine-turned aluminum rear taillight panel surrounded by a chrome border on SS models. Engine choice was similar to 1962, with the small-block and V8s most popular. The Stovebolt six-cylinder engine was replaced with a new Turbo-Thrift six that used thinwall castings and would continue as the standard engine for Chevrolet cars through 1979. The Sport Sedan featured a new, creased roof line. A new &quot;coved&quot; instrument panel included simple indicator lights for hot and cold engine conditions. An optional factory tachometer was built into the dashboard, just above the steering wheel. Impala wagons got triple-unit taillights for the first time.

A special version of the engine was used in the 1963 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe, ordered under Chevrolet Regular Production Option (RPO) Z11. This was a special package created for drag racers and NASCAR and included a 427 with aluminum body parts and a cowl-induction air intake system. The aluminum body parts were fabricated in Flint, Michigan at the facility now known as GM Flint Metal Center. Unlike the later second-generation 427, it was based on the W-series 409 engine, but with a longer stroke. A high-rise, two-piece aluminum intake manifold and dual Carter AFB carburetors fed a 13.5:1 compression ratio to produce and of torque. Fifty RPO Z11 cars were produced at the Flint GM plant.

=== 1964 ===

For 1964, the Impala was restyled to a more rounded, softer look. The signature taillight assembly had an &quot;upside-down U&quot; shaped aluminum trim strip above the taillights, but the individual lights were surrounded by a body-colored panel. The V8 engine returned as the big-block option, as well as dual four-barrel (four-choke) Carter AFB carburetors, which produced at 6,000 rpm and at 4,200 rpm of torque. SS models continued to feature the engine-turned aluminum trim. Rooflines were carried over from 1963 unchanged. Back-up lights were standard.

All full-size 1964 Chevrolet station wagons received small rectangular taillight lenses mounted vertically, one for each side of the car.

The Impala Super Sport became its own series this year instead of an option package.

The 1964 model year is a staple of lowrider culture, and it is commonly mentioned in West Coast hip hop lyrics.

=== Exports ===
Right-hand drive cars were made at GM&#x27;s Oshawa plant in Canada and often shipped overseas in kit form for assembly in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The RHD cars—Chevrolet or equivalent Pontiac (built on Chevrolet frames and using Chevrolet engines in Canada)—all used a right hand drive version of the left-hand drive 1961 Pontiac dashboard.

=== Impala SS ===

In a December 17, 1960, press release, Chevrolet introduced the Impala SS (Super Sport) option to the market. The SS badge was to become Chevrolet&#x27;s signature of performance on many models, though it often has been an appearance package only. The Impala&#x27;s factory SS package in 1961 was truly a performance package when so equipped from the factory with both the trim and &quot;mandatory&quot; suspension and engine upgrades, beginning with the V8 engines available with , , and or the new V8, which in 1961 was rated at . Unlike all other years, the 1961 Super Sport package was available on any Impala, including sedans and station wagons (the sales brochure shows a 4-door hardtop Sport Sedan with the SS package). The package also included upgraded tires on station wagon wheels, springs, shocks and special sintered metallic brake linings. Only 142 1961 Impala Super Sports came from the factory with the 409. In addition to the factory-installed SS package, Chevrolet dealers could add SS trim to any standard Impala without the &quot;mandatory&quot; performance upgrades, and a number of 1961s were so equipped.

Starting for the 1962 model year, the Impala SS was an appearance package limited to hardtop coupe and convertible coupe models, available with all engines in the Impala series starting with the base , inline-6 through 1967, though the big-block engines and heavy-duty parts could still be ordered. From 1967 to 1969, an additional model, the SS427, was available.

The Super Sport was known as Regular Production Option (RPO) Z03, from 1962 to 1963, and again in 1968. From 1964 through 1967, the Super Sport was a separate model, with its own VIN prefix (for example in 1965–67 cars, 164 was the prefix for a regular Impala with a V8 engine, 166 or 168 were used in 1966–68 for a V8-equipped Impala SS). Super Sports from 1962 to 1964 came with engine-turned aluminum trim, which was replaced by a &quot;blackout&quot; trim strip in 1965 which ran under the taillights.

While the Super Sport was for the most part an appearance package for the Impala, Chevrolet did see fit to offer a performance version in a special equipment and trim package that today is rare and valuable. This was Regular Production Option Z24, marketed as the SS 427. This package was available on any 1967–69 2-door Impala and it included Chevrolet&#x27;s 427 cubic inch V8, F41 Sport Suspension, redline tires, and unique SS 427 badges on the body. &quot;SS427&quot; badges were also installed in the interior of the 1968 model only. Approximately 2,000 Z24 cars were built for each model year 1967 and 1968 (slightly more in 1967, less in 1968), and slightly more than 2,400 were built in 1969. The 1969 models were unique in several ways: Disc brakes were standard that year (optional on other years) along with 15 inch wheels, and this was the only year that the cars had the name &quot;Impala&quot; anywhere on the body.

Because &quot;big block muscle&quot; was now focusing on intermediate and even compact size cars, Chevrolet discontinued the Impala Super Sport series after 1969, although the 1970 model was still available with a big block V8 (now displacing 454 cubic inches), bucket seats, a center console with floor shifter.


== Fourth generation (1965–1970)==

Redesigned in 1965, the Impala set an all-time industry annual sales record of more than 1 million units in the United States. All new full-size Chevrolets eschewed the &quot;X&quot; frame for a full-width perimeter frame, a new body that featured curved, frameless side glass (for pillarless models), sharper angled windshield with newly reshaped vent windows, and redesigned full-coil suspension.

In 1965, Chevrolet introduced a new luxury package for the Impala four-door hardtop, called &quot;Caprice&quot; and coded as RPO Z18. Caprices received tufted upholstery, wood grained accents on the dashboard and specialty pulls on the insides of the doors. This &quot;halo&quot; model also featured the &quot;spinner&quot; wheel covers from the Impala SS, with the &quot;SS&quot; logo centers replaced by a Chevrolet &quot;bowtie&quot; emblem. The Super Sport&#x27;s blackout rear trim strip below the triple taillights was also used, with the &quot;Impala SS&quot; emblem replaced by a large &quot;Caprice by Chevrolet&quot; badge. The Impala block lettering on each front fender was replaced with &quot;Caprice&quot; script. The Caprice package was reintroduced as the Chevrolet Caprice Custom in 1966, taking the top position in the full-size Chevrolet lineup.

Engine choices included the inline six-cylinder as well as the small-block and big-block V8s. A new three-range Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission was optional for V8. The old &quot;W&quot; engine was discontinued early in the 1965 model year, so early-production 1965s got the 409, as well as 1/10 of 1% had the 396 CID big-block. Other later-built cars had the as the big-block option. Two-speed Powerglide, as well as 3- and 4-speed manual transmissions were available. As with previous years, Impalas featured more chrome trim inside and out, with pleated tufted upholstery and door panels. The Impala would be the #2-selling convertible in the US in 1966, with 38,000 sold; it was beaten by the Mustang by almost 2:1. 1966 saw a pair of enlarged big-block V8s featuring . The RPO L36 was rated at , the L72 at . The L72 was only available with a manual transmission.

The 1966 Impala was a mild restyle of the 1965, featuring a new instrument panel, grille, wheel covers (except for SS models), and rectangular taillights that wrapped around to the side of the quarter panels. Standard features now included lap belts front and rear, reverse lamps, day/night rearview mirror, and a padded dashboard.

The 1967 model was redesigned with enhanced Coke bottle styling that featured Corvette-inspired front and rear fender bulges. The curves were the most pronounced with the 1967–1968 models. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models. The L72 engine was not available in 1967, but the L36 Turbo-Jet V8 was optional. GM adopted a new lock system for all models, replacing the previous system that had been in use since 1936 with letter-coded keys that changed each year.


The 1968 model was facelifted with a new front end. The new rear bumper housed triple &quot;horseshoe&quot; shaped taillights. 1968 also saw a new Impala model, the Custom Coupe. This two-door hardtop featured the same formal roofline as the Caprice Coupe. It was successful and would be continued through 1976. The L72 &quot;427 Turbo-Jet&quot; engine was once again returned to the option list, a solid-lifter V8 rated at . It would continue to be available for both 1968 and 1969, replaced by the Turbo-Jet 454 for 1970.

The 1969 Impala and other full-sized Chevrolets got new slab-sided bodies with a small &quot;upsweep&quot; at the rear quarter window, giving them a more formal appearance. It retained the 119-inch wheelbase from previous models. New front bumpers that wrapped around the grille and horizontal taillights were in the rear bumper. The hardtop Sport Coupe got a new notchback roofline, replacing the &quot;fastback&quot; C-pillar from 1967 to 1968. Ventless front windows were used on all models. Chevrolet had a rudimentary &quot;power vent&quot; system featuring vents in the instrument panel. The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and when the key was removed, the steering wheel and shift lever were locked.

The 1969 model year Impala production topped Caprice production by 611,000 units. Impala station wagons were renamed Kingswood, a name which would continue through 1972. The similar 1970 Impala got a minor facelift featuring a more conventional under the grille bumper replacing the wrap-around unit used in 1969 along with new triple vertical taillights in the rear bumper. Canadian buyers got the choice of a lower priced companion to the Impala Sport Coupe, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, which used the same body but featured Bel Air trim.

===Exports===

Right-hand drive cars were manufactured in Canada for export to countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, until 1969. They used a version of the 1965 Impala dash panel—without provision for a radio and installed in a dashboard moulding made of fibreglass, not metal—until 1969. Radios (centrally mounted) and heaters were locally sourced and wipers parked in the center of the windscreen.

Australian models were assembled in Australia by General Motors-Holden from kits, as this lessened tax on the cars. The Australian cars had locally sourced amber flashing rear indicators replacing the clear reversing lenses, as red indicators were illegal.

New Zealand models were assembled by General Motors New Zealand with bodies supplied from Canada already welded, painted and trimmed.
== Fifth generation (1971–1976) ==


The Impala remained Chevrolet&#x27;s top-selling model with the fifth generation. A high-performance big block V8 was still available in the form of the Turbo-Jet 454, which produced in 1971, but power decreased as the years went along. The 1971 redesigned B-body would be the largest car ever offered by Chevrolet. The hardtop Sport Coupe continued to be offered; it was a smoothly sloped semi-fastback reminiscent of the 1961 &quot;bubbletop&quot; styling. A three-speed manual transmission remained standard at the beginning of the year, but in the spring of 1971, all V8-equipped full-size GM cars received the Turbo Hydra-Matic as standard equipment. Powerglide remained optionally available for six-cylinder cars until the 1973 models. In keeping with their huge size, these new &quot;B&quot; body Chevrolets were close to Cadillac in luxury features, styling, and ride. Like all GM &quot;B&quot; bodied cars, Impala got a new power ventilation system that remained on while the ignition was on, and included both large vents in the instrument panel and louvers in the trunk. However, the system proved to be problematic and was disliked by many buyers. Power assisted front disc brakes were standard for all models for 1971; variable-ratio power steering became standard in 1972.
The 1972 model has a grille which extended below the bumper. Powertrains consisted of mostly V8 engines. The 250 inline six was still standard for Sport Coupe and 4-door sedan models; the 350 2bbl V8 became the standard engine from 1973 to 1976, with , , (through 72) or optional. The best-selling body style was the formal-roof Custom Coupe. Beginning in 1972, all engines were designed to run on unleaded gasoline. 1972 saw the last Impala convertible; it sold 6,456 units, placing fourth with just under 9 percent of the market, right behind the Corvette&#x27;s 6,508 units sold, ahead of the Mustang&#x27;s 6,401 units sold. The power ventilation system was improved, and exit vents were moved from the trunk lid to the door pillars.

All 1973 Chevrolet vehicles featured a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required impact protection. New taillights were mounted in the (still) conventional rear bumper. The convertible was moved upmarket to the Caprice Classic series. Tweaks to the suspension and frame gave better roadability, according to Chevrolet general manager John Z. DeLorean. Steering wheels and instrument panels were color-keyed to interior colors, as opposed to the matte black used in 1971–1972. The steering wheel rim got a soft-feel grip, and replaced the &quot;Impala&quot; badge with generic &quot;Chevrolet&quot;. The inline six-cylinder engine was now offered on the Bel Air 4-door sedan only, and only with the 3-speed manual transmission. Interiors had repositioned front seats for more legroom. The Impala name returned for the Kingswood station wagon. Suspension and chassis design was modified for better roadability. The bench front seat position was modified to fit tall drivers more comfortably; shorter drivers found it less so.

One thousand 1973 Impalas were built with an &quot;Air Cushion Restraint System&quot; (ACRS) that used an Oldsmobile instrument panel and unique steering wheel that contained both a driver and front passenger air bag. They were all four-door sedans painted in a special green-gold color. The system was not advertised in a big way and many of the cars were used for crash testing by both GM and the U.S. government. Over the decades, the system proved durable and successfully protected front passengers in front-end collisions. Chevrolet did not offer ACRS in 1974; however, it was offered in Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac models that year as an option and did save lives. One ACRS-equipped Impala was preserved and remains a witness to the ability of an American automaker to design life saving safety systems into cars without a government mandate. Notably, an ACRS-equipped Impala was used on the television series Seinfeld as Kramer&#x27;s personal vehicle. No other examples are known as of this time.
In 1974, the rear bumper was redesigned with shock absorbers to meet the upgraded standards and new tail lights were added. The front end was also freshened as in previous years, with a new grille and headlight bezels, a new header panel, and a bumper with a drop down center section. The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps once again. This was the only year of the 1971–1976 models the Impala had a different front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous-year Caprice front to distinguish the two. The rooflines of the Impala coupes were also revised. For 1974, the Custom Coupe was no longer a hardtop, with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B-pillar. The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down quarter glass like that of the 1971–1973 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, fastback style, flat back window. Sedans used carryover body shells from previous years. In an unusual styling move, the optional Impala wheel covers for 1974 were the same as the 1970 Impalas.


A limited-edition Spirit of America package was offered in 1974 on Sport Coupe models; primarily an appearance package, it featured white or blue body paint, a white full vinyl top, white upholstery with red or blue trim, color-keyed seat belts and floormats, special wheel covers, optional white rally wheels, sports-styled dual remote outside rear view mirrors, a vinyl body side molding insert, and red pin-striping. Special fender and dashboard badges announced the package to passers-by and passengers. Chevrolet also offered Nova and Vega Spirit of America versions as well.

The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice model was revised with a new front end with a swept back style header panel with recessed headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the radio and climate control graphics. Speedometers read up to , and added kilometers per hour. A High Energy Ignition (HEI) system was officially introduced in 1975, although it was installed on some 1974 cars as a clandestine option. Catalytic converters were also introduced, as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package (which also included a coolant temperature gauge), intermittent wipers, and a divided 50/50 bench seat with passenger-side recliner (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim). This was the final year of the full-size Chevrolet convertible. Four-door models got new rooflines; the hardtop Sport Sedan got a small triangular &quot;opera window&quot; carved out of the wide roof panel.

A Landau model available for 1975–1976 models featured a landau vinyl roof (with a chrome band across the roof), a choice of special paint colors, sports-styled dual remote outside rearview mirrors, color-keyed wheel covers, a vinyl bodyside molding insert, and pin-striping. Inside were color-keyed seat belts and floormats. Fender and dashboard emblems rounded out the package. The 2-door hardtop model (dubbed the &quot;Sport Coupe&quot;) was discontinued after 1975, leaving the redesigned Custom Coupe, with its wide &quot;B&quot; pillar and fixed rear window, the only 2-door Impala available in 1976. This body style had been introduced for the 1974 model year, a precursor to Detroit&#x27;s complete abandonment of pillarless body styles before the end of the 1970s. 1976 Impalas used a previous year Caprice nose, with a new &quot;egg crate&quot; grille insert. The Impala had round headlamps while the Caprice used the new quad rectangular ones. For fleet buyers, Chevrolet offered a lower priced Impala &quot;S&quot; model that deleted some of the standard model&#x27;s luxury features, such as radial tires, sound insulation, and trunk light. The &quot;S&quot; was available in both a 4-door sedan and station wagon, and effectively replaced the Bel Air for the U.S. market (the Bel Air continued in production in Canada until 1981).

==Sixth generation (1977–1985)==

The changes in the automobile marketplace resulted in Chevrolet redesigning the Impala for the 1977 model year to meet changing demands. It, as well as the other downsized B-body sedans, went on sale in late September 1976. The new downsized Impalas were shorter in length, taller and narrower than before. The new Impala&#x27;s frame was a shortened version of the one introduced in 1970 and would be used until 1996 when the B-body production line was shut down. Even with its smaller exterior dimensions, the new Impala featured increased headroom, rear-seat legroom, and trunk space. Production of the downsized model increased substantially over 1976, and the Impala regained the number one U.S. sales position. The redesigned 1977 Impala/Caprice was named &quot;Motor Trend&quot; car of the year.

Pillarless hardtops were discontinued, the result of rumors of federal rollover standards looming in the near future. The 1977–1979 coupes sported a double-bent, tempered rear window similar to what was later used for the 1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Aerocoupe. For the 1980 model year, a mid-cycle refresh replaced this complex backlight in the coupe with a more upright nearer flat glass, although the overall design remained similar.

Engine availability was reduced for 1977; the inline-6 was reintroduced with . Options included V8 engines. The V8 engine was available in some years. Oldsmobile&#x27;s V8 diesel engine also was available. Starting in 1980, the inline-six was replaced by a 229 cubic-inch (3.8 liter) V6 from Chevrolet which was different from the 3.8 liter (231 cubic inch) V6 from Buick that was installed in numerous GM models of different divisions.

The Impala and the upscale Caprice sold well into the early 1980s. The Impala was reduced to the base model full-size Chevrolet and was popular with fleet usage, including taxi and police-pursuit vehicles. The Impala coupe and wagon body styles were dropped after 1982 and the nameplate was eliminated in 1985, while the Caprice continued unchanged until 1990. Upon the demise of the Impala name, the base model full-size Chevrolet was rebranded Caprice starting in 1986, with the upper models being called the Caprice Classic and Caprice Classic Brougham.

In some model years, these vehicles were also assembled in Southgate, CA, and St. Louis, MO.

Production Figures

== Seventh generation (Impala SS, 1994–1996) ==
In January 1990, the GM B platform&#x27;s body was redesigned for the 1991 model year, though it retained the same shortened frame design of the 1977 model year redesign. The Impala SS badge was resurrected at the 1992 Detroit Auto Show as a concept car designed by GM designer Jon Moss. The concept car was two inches lower to the ground than the regular Caprice, and was powered by an engine. Eventually, the concept car&#x27;s engine was replaced with a detuned LT1 V8 engine derived from the fourth generation Corvette.

The 1994 Impala SS went into production on February 14, 1994, at GM&#x27;s plant in Arlington, Texas, and was almost identical cosmetically to the concept car, with the only noticeable change being the chromed bowtie logo on the grill (vs. a red logo on the concept). The car was, in essence, a high-performance version of the Caprice heavily based on the Caprice 9C1 police package. As such, it got much of the equipment formerly available only to law enforcement and government agencies. This included a sport-tuned suspension with reinforced shocks and springs, a high-capacity reverse-flow cooling system (derived from the Corvette&#x27;s LT1), four-wheel disc brakes, transmission cooler, dual exhaust, a higher-output electrical system, and other minor mechanical and electrical alterations. 

The Impala SS was fitted with a standard 3.08 gear. The limited-slip rear differential was standard (as opposed to the optional G80 on Caprices) and the suspension was an inch lower. A retuned LT1 small-block V8 was standard on the Impala SS, making and of torque (retuned from the prototype&#x27;s rating). The primary difference between the LT1 in the Impala and the LT1 that was in the Corvette and Camaro was that the Impala engine was fitted with cast-iron cylinder heads instead of aluminum ones, and a camshaft that was designed more for low-end torque than high-end horsepower. Another difference was that the block casting for the Impala LT1 had two-bolt main bearing caps while the casting used for the Corvette LT1 had four-bolt main bearing caps. The transmission was the 4L60E, which was an electronically controlled version of the previously hydraulically controlled 4L60. However, the transmission was not upgraded up for the power of the LT1, nor the extra weight of the body and frame, and transmission failures after were commonplace.

The Impala SS received body-colored trim, a unique single-bar grille with no hood ornament, and a rear deck spoiler. It was fitted with brushed aluminum wheels with 255/50ZR17 all-season tires. Inside, the car came with a central console with cup holders (1994 and 1995 models) and a storage compartment, leather seats embroidered with the Impala SS logo, and a standard leather-wrapped steering wheel. For the 1994 model year, it was available only in black with a gray interior. Due to a shortage of the unique five-spoke aluminum wheels, only 6,303 cars were sold. However, the wheel shortage was remedied for the 1995 model year and 21,434 cars were sold.

In 1995, &quot;Dark Cherry Metallic&quot; and &quot;Dark Grey Green&quot; were added as exterior color options, and the body paneling on the rear quarter panel was altered to reflect the cosmetic effect formerly achieved by a window insert. The black units continued to receive semi-gloss door moldings and wheel-well trim, whereas the other color offerings received those items in full gloss. Another change from 1994 was the placement of the side mirrors from pods attached to the door to a larger format attached to the &#x27;A&#x27; pillar. 1996 was the last year of production with 41,941 units sold. The 1996 Impala SS was also exported to the Middle East, as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel and the badge on the dashboard saying &quot;Caprice SS&quot;. The 1996 Impala SS production went late into the model year; the last one being produced on December 13, 1996. &quot;Marblehead Gray Metallic&quot; had been planned for that final year; however, the option was cancelled at the last minute even though many trim part numbers for the color had already been designated. The last year saw minor interior alterations, with the digital speedometer being replaced by an analog one, along with a tachometer. The shifter was moved from the column to the center console, and the engine was given an OBD-II computer control system (the camshaft was reground to adjust for the new computer).

===Discontinuation===
The entire B-body line, consisting of the Chevrolet Caprice, Impala SS, and Buick Roadmaster, as well as the related D-Body Fleetwood, was discontinued, as GM wanted more assembly lines to be able to produce more profitable SUVs. A ceremony was held at the plant on December 13, 1996, as the last Impala SS was produced.

==Eighth generation (2000–2005)==

The Impala name was revived for the 2000 model year, being introduced on April 8, 1999. With a wheelbase three inches longer (though an inch shorter overall) than the mid-size Lumina, the new Chevrolet Impala was categorized as full-size by cars.com but mid-size by Consumer Guide Automotive. Based on the Lumina&#x27;s W-body platform, it was built at Oshawa Car Assembly in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Unlike the earlier Impalas built on a B-body, this one was front-wheel drive and was available with a choice of two engines, the 3.8L V6 engine, and the slightly smaller 3.4L V6 engine. A new Impala SS with a supercharged 3.8L V6 was brought out for the 2004 model year.

The Impala was available in two trim levels from 2000 to 2003. The base model came equipped with cloth bench seats, steel wheels, the 3.4 liter (204 cu in) &quot;LA1&quot; V6, and a 3-gauge instrument cluster. The &quot;LS&quot; came factory-equipped with cloth bucket seats upgradeable to leather with center console and floor shift, color-keyed &quot;Impala&quot; door scripts and trunk badge, anti-lock brakes, traction control system, keyless remote entry, integrated foglamps, aluminum wheels upgradeable to alloy wheels, rear spoiler (optional on the base models), 4-gauge instrument cluster (with tachometer), and the larger 3.8 liter (231 cu in) &quot;L36&quot; V6. Options available on all models included a sunroof, OnStar system, Driver Information Center with built-in HomeLink system, heated power front seats, and 16-inch 1990s SS-inspired wheels. All models came equipped with power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The rear spoiler was an option on base models, and could be deleted from LS models upon buyer&#x27;s request. 

The 2004–2005 Impala SS came equipped with the 3.8 liter (231 cu in) supercharged &quot;L67&quot; V6 engine. It was rated at and had been previously used in the Pontiac Grand Prix &quot;GTP&quot;, Buick Regal &quot;GS&quot;, Buick Riviera, and H-body Pontiac Bonneville &quot;SSEI&quot; and Buick Park Avenue &quot;Ultra&quot;. The lighter front-wheel-drive sedan was as quick as the vaunted 1990s Impala SS, with times pushing 6.5 seconds, compared to the earlier model&#x27;s time also showing 6.5 seconds (albeit 7.1 seconds on average). To commemorate Chevrolet&#x27;s long relationship with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500 race, a limited edition (4,088 produced) Impala Indy SS was offered in 2004, notably featuring a black grille with gold Chevrolet bowtie emblem that would be carried over to all Impala models in 2005, various Indy logos on the exterior and interior, 17-inch chrome wheels, and gauge cluster package.

===Impala 9C1 and 9C3 (eighth generation)===

The 9C1 Police Package was first released in 2000, followed by the 9C3 Undercover Police Package in 2001. Available only to law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and EMS agencies, it has had much more success than its predecessor, the Lumina 9C3. The 9C1 was a base model with a stronger suspension and the 3.8 liter (231 cu in) V6 engine. It also came with the option for a rear vinyl bench seat and front cloth bucket or bench seats, both cloth front and rear seats, or vinyl front and rear seats. It also offered preparation for a criminal cage to be installed between the front and rear seats. It was only available in a few basic colors. Another addition was the &quot;SURV MODE&quot; switch that replaced the fog light switch found on the LS. This enabled the driver to turn off all lights in the vehicle and &quot;hide&quot;; something not allowed with the civilian models, as automatic headlights were standard. The 9C3 was comparably equipped to the 9C1, but the ability to add other convenience options and more paint and interior choices set the 9C3 apart.

Sales for the Impala 9C1 and 9C3 were strong with law enforcement and they were especially popular with large city fleets such as the NYPD and Philadelphia Police Department. However, the Ford Crown Victoria P71 still held the sales lead and was preferred by most agencies due to its larger size, much more durable V8 engine, rear-wheel drive layout, and body-on-frame platform.

== Ninth generation (2006–2016) ==
===2006===
The 2006 Impala was introduced at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show. Like the first generation Buick LaCrosse, the ninth generation Impala used the updated GM W platform. The base engine was a 3.5L (214 cu in) V6 producing and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The new Impala featured new taillights, different from the four-circle style of the previous generation. The Ninth-generation Impala was mostly sold to fleet operators, with private buyers accounting for a quarter of sales.

The &quot;SS&quot; model used the Generation IV small-block V8, the first (and so far only) V8 available in a front-wheel-drive Chevrolet, and the first V8 in a Chevrolet sedan since the 1996 Caprice. The 5.3-liter (325 cu in) V8 (with Displacement on Demand, later called Active Fuel Management or AFM) produced . With the LS4 V8, the Impala SS is capable of a 5.6 second time and a quarter-mile time of 14.2 seconds traveling at . The ninth generation Impala has a drag coefficient of 0.33.

Available trim levels at the time of introduction of the ninth generation were the LS, LT, LTZ, and the SS. Six-passenger seating was available as an option on the LS and LT models only. Leather upholstery was standard on LTZ models and optional on LT models. The ninth generation Impala featured a wood trim center console with chrome accents on all major control buttons. The dashboard featured a chrome Impala logo embedded in the wood grain trim that runs across the dashboard and onto the doors. The control knobs found throughout the vehicle&#x27;s cockpit were similar to those found in Buick models as well as the Cadillac DTS, all of which featured a similar center console. Another interior revision was the location of the cup holders, which were moved beneath the midsection of the vehicle&#x27;s center console.

The LS was the base model. It offered steel wheels with wheel covers (later alloy wheels), an AM/FM stereo with single-disc (six-disc optional) CD player and MP3 capability, SiriusXM, auxiliary input jack, six speakers, keyless entry, air conditioning, cloth seating surfaces, and a choice of two front bucket or a split front bench seat. The LT was the mid-range model. It offered alloy wheels, and optional front heated seats. The LTZ was the most luxurious model: it offered heated leather seats, an AM/FM stereo with CD/MP3 capability (six-disc optional), SiriusXM, a Bose eight-speaker premium sound system, a power sunroof, security system, and OnStar. The SS was the top-of-the-line model, which offered a 5.3-liter V8 engine, heated leather SS embroidered seats, unique eighteen-inch machined-finished alloy wheels, and SS badging. The SS trim line was discontinued after 2009, leaving the LTZ as the top-of-the-line model for 2010. A mechanical refresh for 2012 brought the revised 3.6-liter V6 (with variable valve timing) to all trims as the single engine offering, paired with an updated 6-speed automatic transmission. The new combination once again pushed the Impala to a 300-horsepower rating, and continued with the Impala Limited from 2014 to 2016.

===2007===
In 2007, the Impala received the flex-fuel 3.5-liter V6 and &quot;FlexFuel&quot; rear badge for the LS, LT, and LTZ. A new 3.9-liter V6 with Active Fuel Management was available. The SS retained the same drivetrain and did not receive the Flex Fuel feature because of the high-performance nature of the powertrain. A tire pressure monitoring system, cruise control, and a CD player were standard on all models, and a factory spoiler was an available option. The LT had 16-inch, five-spoke alloy wheels. The 7th-generation OnStar system with turn-by-turn navigation was included when the available directions and connections service was selected. The SS had standard leather-appointed seats and XM Satellite Radio, with XM being optional on LS, LT, and LTZ trims. A new Luxury Edition package featuring leather seating, folding rear seat, and rear spoiler was offered on the LT. There were four new exterior colors—&quot;Precision Red&quot;, &quot;Imperial Blue Metallic&quot;, &quot;Bordeaux Red&quot;, and &quot;Red Jewel Tintcoat&quot;, as well as a Regency-outfitted &quot;Impala RSS.&quot; The RSS included more aggressive looking wheels, front/rear bumper and rocker panel extensions, a spoiler, and various interior upgrades.

===2008===
To commemorate the Impala&#x27;s 50th year, a 50th Anniversary Edition was introduced in Spring 2008. Based on the LT, it added a FE3 Sport Suspension (replacing the FE1 Touring Suspension), four-wheel ABS, eighteen-inch SS-style alloy wheels (replacing the 16-inch wheels), rear SS style spoiler, &quot;50th Anniversary&quot; Impala badges on the C-pillars, two-tone, leather-trimmed seats with &quot;50th&quot; logos embroidered on the front headrests, eight-way power-adjustable driver seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel with accent-color threading including audio controls, ebony carpet, ebony floor mats with accent threading, &quot;50th&quot; Anniversary emblems on the sill plates, and a choice of two premium exterior colors: &quot;Black Granite Metallic&quot; and &quot;Red Jewel Tintcoat&quot;. The 50th Anniversary Edition was only available with the 3.5L V6 engine. A Luxury Edition package was again available on the LT and now also featured a leather-wrapped steering wheel, steering wheel mounted audio controls, traction control, and anti-lock brakes.

===2009===
For the 2009 model year, the Impala received three new exterior colors: &quot;Victory Red&quot;, &quot;Silver Ice Metallic&quot;, and &quot;Aqua Blue Metallic&quot;, while the brushed aluminum dash appliqué was no longer available. All models used the previous SS-style spoiler (already phased in late in the 2008 model year). Leather seating was no longer available in combination with the 40/20/40 split bench front seat. The Active Fuel Management feature remained on the 5.3L V8 with a 17-gallon fuel tank for the SS model, but was no longer available on the 3.9-liter V6 for the LT and LTZ models. A sun and wheel package was available on 1LT models included power sunroof, overhead console with Homelink and 17-inch aluminum wheels. A Bose Premium Audio System was now part of the Luxury Edition package offered on LT models. Thorax side-impact air bags were standard.

===2010===
For the 2010 model year, the Impala was the only GM W-body car in production, although the eight-cylinder SS model was discontinued. LT models included fog lights and once again offered an optional Luxury Edition package. The 3.9L V6 was no longer available for the LT model. Two new exterior colors were available: &quot;Summit White&quot; and &quot;Cyber Gray Metallic&quot;, and four exterior colors were deleted. The (PDG) convenience package, AM/FM stereo with 6-disc in-dash CD changer, and trunk cargo net were no longer available. The Impala emblems on rear sail panels as well as the rear decklid badge on LS models were deleted. Early 2010 models had the lower front-side GM badges but were also later deleted.

===2011===
For the 2011 model year, the Impala carried over the LS, LT, and LTZ trims. Available engines were a 3.5-liter V6 (LS or LT) or a 3.9-liter V6 (LTZ only). A Luxury Edition package was again an option on the LT and featured leather heated seats, 6-way power front passenger seat, Bose Premium Audio System, XM radio, auto-dimming rearview mirror, Universal Home Remote, outside heated power mirrors, and rear spoiler. The 2011 Impala had the same wheels as the 2012–2013 Impala, but the 2011 Impala was the last model year where the chrome trim on the trunk lid appeared.

===2012===

For the 2012 model year, the exterior received a slight refresh and three trims: LS, LT, and LTZ. The 3.5 and 3.9-liter engines were dropped in favor of the 3.6-liter LFX engine that delivers and of torque. The four-speed automatic transmission was also dropped in favor of a six-speed automatic. All models now have dual exhaust mufflers. The Impala also received new packages, including the LS Uplevel package, LS OnStar and Bluetooth package, LT Sunroof package, LT OnStar package, and the LT OnStar and Bluetooth package.

===2013===
For the 2013 model year, the Impala was largely a carryover of the 2012 model. Available trims were once again LS, LT, and LTZ. It was the last retail Impala to be offered with optional bench seat and column shift transmission. A Luxury Edition package, last seen on the 2011 model, returned as an option on the LT and featured perforated leather seating surfaces, dual front heated bucket seats with driver&#x27;s side 8-way and passenger&#x27;s side 6-way power adjusters, inside rearview auto-dimming mirror, Universal Home Remote, outside heated power adjustable mirrors, Bose 8-speaker premium sound system, six-disc in-dash CD changer that played MP3 and WMA files, with Radio Data System, Sirius-XM satellite radio, as well as an auxiliary input. This was notably the last production car to have a bench seat in the front. Due to the early release of the redesigned 2014 model, the 2013 Impala had an abbreviated model year.

===Impala Limited (2014–2016)===
The ninth generation model remained in production in LS, LT, and LTZ trims until the 2016 model year as a rental, fleet, and police car under the revised model name &quot;Impala Limited.&quot; The consolidated plant in Oshawa, Canada, continued making the Impala Limited, along with the Chevrolet Equinox. Production ended in May 2016.

===Impala 9C1 and 9C3 (ninth generation)===

The Impala again was offered as a police vehicle in the ninth generation form. The 9C1 and 9C3 models were based on the LS model, yet offered steel wheels or steel wheels with wheel covers, optional rubber flooring, preparation for police equipment such as sirens, radios, lighting, special badging, inoperable rear door handles, windows, and door locks. It also came with the option for a rear vinyl bench seat as well as front cloth bucket or bench seats, both cloth front and rear seats, or vinyl front and rear seats. In addition, it offered preparation for a criminal cage to be installed between the front and rear seats. The fog lamps seen on the LT, LTZ, and SS were optional in 2008 and stayed as an option until 2012. The 9C1 and 9C3 also had the option of having the spoiler seen on the LT and LTZ until being replaced by the spoiler that is on the SS in 2009. In 2007, Active Fuel Management became an option across the board for the Impala. The police sedans received flex-fuel capability in 2008 to compete against the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, which also received a similar feature allowing it to utilize E85. From 2006 to 2011, the Impala 9C1 and 9C3 models used the V6 paired to the heavy duty 4T65E-HD transmission and had standard dual exhaust.&lt;ref name=&quot;LZG/9specs&quot;&gt;General Motors&lt;/ref&gt; Police Sedans utilized the SS radiator and cooling system as an upgrade from the standard 3.9L engine (used in the Impala LTZ). Furthermore, the heavy-duty steel wheels were not redesigned. Instead, the Police Sedan used the original center caps or the older style wheel covers which were carried over from the 8th generation model. The 9C1 and 9C3 were equipped with an external trunk lock tumbler starting in 2008 which was not available for the civilian version of the car. The 9C1 and 9C3 police models had the standard wood grain for the 2006 model year until 2007 where it was replaced by aluminized interior trim. In 2010, the aluminized interior trim was replaced with faux carbon-fiber. For the 2012 model year refresh, both the 9C1 and 9C3 replaced the fog lamps with brake cooling ducts not seen on civilian models, body colored exterior trunk trim, larger 17-inch wheels with new wheel covers, and the same LFX V6 that powers the civilian Impala paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. After the tenth generation Impala was introduced, the ninth generation Impala 9C1 and 9C3 remained in production as the Impala Limited and had a &quot;Limited&quot; badge on the trunk. The Caprice PPV succeeded the Impala 9C1 after production ended in 2016. Up to then, the Caprice 9C1 and Impala 9C1 was offered simultaneously.

== Tenth generation (2014–2020) ==

The tenth-generation Impala was introduced at the 2012 New York Auto Show for the 2014 model year, with sales and production commencing March 4, 2013. The tenth generation Impala was the first North American sedan in 20 years to earn &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;″ top score, with a score of 95 of a possible 100 points.

This tenth generation, according to autoblog.com, is once again classified as full-size, the previous generation having been mid-size. It is larger than the previous generation, sharing the extended Epsilon II FWD platform with the Cadillac XTS and Buick Lacrosse. It was assembled in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, alongside the ninth-generation Impala (now renamed the fleet and rental exclusive-only Impala Limited), and at the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly in the United States. All trim levels are equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission with sport and manual shifting modes.

The tenth generation models were shipped to dealerships across North America on March 25, 2013, and officially went on sale to the public on April 1, 2013. That same day regular production on the Impala (the 2.4L eAssist and 3.6L equipped versions/LT2 and LTZ2 trims only) began at their Oshawa plant, while production at GM&#x27;s Detroit-Hamtramck plant (the 2.5L equipped versions/LS, LT1 and LTZ1 trims) started production on April 8 and arrived to dealerships in May. The eAssist versions went on sale in the fourth quarter of 2013.

In 2014, the Impala saw its share of the full-size sedan market increase to 14.7 percent, up from 6.9 percent in 2013.

The 2014 Impala came standard with 18-inch wheels (19- and 20-inch offered in higher trims), low-profile HID headlights, and LED daytime running lights (on LTZ trim), and offered three engines: a 2.5L 4-cylinder (the first time the Impala used this type), a 2.4L 4-cylinder with hybrid-assist technology, and a 3.6L V6. The interior came equipped with a 4.2-inch color display featuring Chevrolet MyLink (LT and LTZ trims), HD Radio (all trims), Pandora Radio (LT and LTZ trims), and active noise cancellation for all 4-cylinder models, while new safety features included ten standard airbags combined with OnStar. Optional features for the 2014 model included full-speed-range adaptive cruise control; a collision-mitigation braking system; alert systems for forward collision, lane departure, blind spot, and rear cross traffic; backup camera; and rear parking sensors.

===Model year changes===
For 2015, 4G LTE was added to OnStar as an optional feature. HD Radio was no longer offered starting with the 2015 model year. In addition, the eAssist version was discontinued because of poor sales.

For the 2016 model year, the Impala went from five to four trim levels: LS, LT1, LT2, and LTZ2. A Midnight appearance package was added as an upgrade for the LT and LTZ level trims, which included unique black-pocket wheels and gloss black badges in addition to the standard black paint. Five new colors were introduced: &quot;Siren Red Tintcoat&quot;, &quot;Citron Green Metallic&quot;, &quot;Heather Gray Metallic&quot;, &quot;Mosaic Black Metallic&quot;, and &quot;Green Envy Metallic&quot;; six colors were dropped: &quot;Autumn Bronze&quot;, &quot;Red Rock&quot;, &quot;Crystal Red Tintcoat&quot;, &quot;Ashen Gray&quot;, &quot;Silver Topaz&quot;, and &quot;Champagne Silver&quot;. The &quot;Jet Black&quot;/&quot;Brownstone&quot; interior color scheme was dropped. 2016 models also came equipped with a new 800 cold-cranking amp battery, replacing the 900 CCA. Wireless charging for devices, front and rear splash guards, as well as lane change alert were added. The CD player was now only offered as standard equipment on the LTZ, but available as an option on other trims as part of the Technology package. 2016 also saw the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability features; only one phone brand at any one time can be used.

In addition to the &quot;OnStar/Connections Plan&quot; being rebranded as the &quot;Guidance Plan&quot;, the 2016 Impala&#x27;s option packages were rebranded:

*LS Convenience to Protection Package
*Advanced Safety to Driver Confidence Package
*Premium Seating to Leather Package
*Premium Audio and Sport Wheels to Technology Package
*Comfort and Convenience to Enhanced Convenience Package
*Premium Audio to Advanced Technology Package

The 2017 model year Impala only saw minor changes, with the top-of-the-line LTZ trim rebrand as the Premier trim and &quot;Pepperdust Metallic&quot; introduced as a new color option. The LS trim, previously available only with the four-cylinder engine, added a V6 engine option.

The 2018 model year Impala went from four trims to three: LS, LT, and Premier. The LT level trim added Entertainment, Convenience, and Leather package options, while the Premier trim received the top-of-the-line Convenience package. Keyless starting, a backup camera, and MyLink became standard on all three trim levels, as the LS trim deleted the 4.2 inch display. LED daytime running lights became standard on LT and navigation became standard on Premier. During the third quarter of 2018, three new colors, &quot;Nightfall Gray Metallic&quot;, &quot;Cajun Red Tintcoat&quot;, and &quot;Graphite Metallic&quot;, were introduced.

The 2019 model year Impala only saw minor changes. The jet black interior was added to the LT Convenience Package, while the accessory level wheel locks became standard on all trims. The &quot;Graphite Metallic&quot; color was discontinued.

The 2020 model year Impala (its final year for the sedan) dropped the LS trim, leaving only the LT and Premier level trims. The four-cylinder engine was also dropped, leaving the 3.6L V6 engine as the only engine offered. In addition, certain features and option packages were deleted from both models.

===2015 Bi-Fuel===
The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Bi-Fuel runs on CNG (compressed natural gas) and gasoline. Unveiled in October 2013 by General Motors CEO Dan Akerson, the Bi-Fuel Impala would be offered to both fleet customers and retail. It was the only full-size CNG vehicle manufactured in North America. The new Impala joined the Honda Civic as a rare factory-made CNG car to come straight from a major automaker and available for retail sales.

The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Bi-Fuel had a 500-mile driving range. It allowed the driver to switch from gasoline to CNG or from CNG to gasoline at the push of a button. The CNG tank was placed in the trunk. The Impala Bi-Fuel was one of the five finalists for the 2015 Green Car of the Year Award during the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show, but lost to the BMW i3.

===International markets===

The Impala went on sale in South Korea as an export vehicle for the 2016 model year, marking the first time that Chevrolet had offered an American-built full-size sedan in the Korean market.

===Trim levels===
The tenth-generation Chevrolet Impala was available in three trim levels: LS, LT, and LTZ (later Premier):

LS – Includes: 2.5L EcoTec four-cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, six-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch black-painted steel wheels with full plastic wheel covers, 4.2-inch color LCD radio with Bluetooth (2014–2017 models), 8-inch Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system (2018–2019 models), 100-watt six-speaker audio system, keyless entry, premium cloth seating surfaces (2014–2017 models), premium cloth seating surfaces with leatherette trim (2018–2019 models), power-adjustable front driver&#x27;s bucket seat, OnStar with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi capabilities (2015–2019 models), leather-wrapped steering wheel, split-folding rear bench seat, color-keyed exterior door handles, and black side mirrors. The LS trim was discontinued after the 2019 model year.

LT – Adds to LS: 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, 8-inch Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system, security system, remote vehicle start, premium cloth seating surfaces with leatherette trim, dual power-adjustable front bucket seats, color-keyed side mirrors, and wood interior trim.

LTZ (Premier) – Adds to LT: 3.6L VVT V6 gasoline engine with flex-fuel capability, 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, keyless access with push-button start, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front and rear seats, heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, exterior LED daytime running lamps (DRLs), rearview backup camera system, chrome-accented color-keyed exterior door handles with touch sensors, and chrome side mirrors.

=== Safety ===
==Discontinuation==
There was speculation that GM would discontinue the Impala in 2018 because of declining sales of American full-size sedans, in order to make room for more production of crossover SUVs. However, GM CEO Mary Barra later said that unlike Ford and FCA, GM had no plans to exit the sedan market, and at the time stated that the Impala would continue in production as a way to fill the void left by the planned departure of the Ford Taurus in 2019.

GM later reversed course and made plans to idle the Detroit-Hamtramck and Oshawa assembly facilities and retire the Impala nameplate. After originally intending to end production in June 2019, GM decided to keep the Impala in production, with the extension of the assembly plants&#x27; idling to 2020. The final Chevrolet Impala was built at the Detroit/Hamtramck assembly plant on February 27, 2020.

==Yearly sales==
==Safety==
In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s crash tests, the 2000 to 2005 Impala was given a &quot;Good&quot; rating overall for good structural performance and no chance of any significant injury in a crash of its severity, except for possibly a minor lower-left-leg injury, such as a bruise or sprain. The 2006 to 2013 Impala was given a lesser overall &quot;Acceptable&quot; score for front impact collisions and a &quot;Good&quot; score for side impacts. Side-curtain airbags were standard for front and rear rows; side torso airbags previously unavailable became standard on all trim levels beginning with the 2009 model year. GM made some minor structural enhancements to the Impala, beginning in December 2009; models produced after that received a &quot;Good&quot; in the IIHS frontal offset crash test.

In September 2009, a local news station&#x27;s investigative team in Rhode Island discovered that GM&#x27;s fleet customers who purchased the 2006–2009 Impala were able to order them with the side-curtain airbags deleted for a savings of $175 per vehicle. Because these fleets typically sell off their cars after two to three years of use, many of the Impalas that were built without side-curtain airbags became privately owned cars. 

Another potential safety hazard, affecting Impalas of model years 2007 and 2008, is premature rear tire wear caused by defective rear suspension components. Police vehicles were upgraded to correct this defect and law enforcement agencies were compensated for expenses incurred for tire replacement, but civilian vehicles were not recalled. As a result, Impala owners launched a class action lawsuit in July 2011 against General Motors. In response, the current General Motors leadership claimed about a month later that they were not responsible to repair the defective vehicles manufactured pre–General Motors bailout. Subsequently, in late September, a new lawsuit, disputing the GM response, was initiated by three of the estimated 400,000 Impala owners. (GM was also facing a similar legal dispute regarding a pre-bankruptcy upgrade to its OnStar system which left thousands of users without service in violation of their paid-up contracts.)

On April 22, 2014, the NHTSA opened an investigation into 60,000 2014 Chevrolet Impala models over concerns relating to the sedan&#x27;s emergency braking system. This followed the NHTSA receiving a complaint from a driver who experienced &quot;inappropriate activation of the emergency braking system,&quot; adding it &quot;alleges that the driver assist system inappropriately activated emergency braking bringing the vehicle to a complete stop under what the driver considered to be full braking force.&quot; The driver also went on to say that he heard three to four beeps from the system while driving the rented vehicle, which had only 2500 miles on it. GM was fully cooperating in the investigation.

==Awards==
In 1966, Impala Place in Hillsborough, Auckland was named in honour of the car.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine awarded the full-size Chevrolet including the Impala as its 1977 Car of the Year.

&quot;Automotive Fleet&quot; and &quot;Business Fleet&quot; magazines awarded the Impala the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Fleet Car of the Year.

Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) selected the Impala for its 2006 Pyramid Award for Environmental Initiatives for the launch of its new ethanol-powered E-85 model.

==NASCAR==
In 2007, the Impala began to replace the Monte Carlo on the NASCAR stock car racing circuit; more specifically, on all the scheduled racing events where NASCAR has mandated the use of a car with different (and some new) specifications, better known as the Car of Tomorrow.

The Impala was also used to represent Chevrolet in the Nationwide Series. In 2013, the Impala was replaced by the Camaro in the Nationwide Series.

The Impala was also used in the NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series. It was replaced by the Camaro in 2018.

The 2012 NASCAR season marked the end of use of the Impala nameplate on stock cars. From 2013 to 2017, Chevrolet drivers began driving the Holden VF Commodore SSV based Chevrolet SS in Sprint Cup until the Chevrolet SS was discontinued after 2017.

<text>Nantua (; Arpitan: &quot;Nantuat&quot;) is a commune in and subprefecture of the Ain département in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Eastern France. The commune of Nantua comprises the glacial Lac de Nantua.

Located in the Haut-Bugey historical region, among the southern foothills of the Jura Mountains, it is famous for its fresh-water fish and crayfish.

==History==
The town grew up around a Benedictine monastery founded in 671 by Amandus and the church of St Peter where the body of Charles the Bald was initially buried.

The priory of Nantua was sacked and burned in 1230 by Stephen I of Thoire-Villars. Boniface of Savoy was selected prior in 1232.

In 1944, a hundred men were arrested and deported and the local French Secret Army leader was shot dead by the Nazis in response to French resistance activities.

==Demographics==
==Climate==
Nantua faces the small Lac de Nantua on its west side and is protected by high cliffs on its landward sides which gives rise to a relatively mild continental climate.

==Twin towns — sister cities==
Nantua is twinned with:

<doc id="285012" wikidata="Q26853" url="?curid=285012" title="Camilo Cienfuegos">
<text>Camilo Cienfuegos Gorriarán (; 6 February 1932 – 28 October 1959) was a Cuban revolutionary. One of the major figures of the Cuban Revolution, he was considered second only to Fidel Castro among the revolutionary leadership. 

The son of Spanish anarchists, Cienfuegos engaged with left-wing politics from an early age, going on to join the opposition movement against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. He joined Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement on its expedition to Cuba and was one of the few survivors of the Landing of the Granma. He quickly distinguished himself as one of the top commanders of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces and a popular leading figure of the revolution, becoming close friends with Che Guevara during their guerrilla campaign in Las Villas. After winning the Battle of Yaguajay in December 1958, Cienfuegos led the capture of Matanzas and Havana, where he was appointed as commander-in-chief of the armed forces by the new revolutionary government. He oversaw the reorganization of the armed forces, in order to purge leading figures of the Cuban National Army and replace them with guerrilla commanders more loyal to Fidel Castro. 

When Huber Matos objected to Castro&#x27;s consolidation of power, he was arrested by Cienfuegos. While flying back from Matos&#x27; former headquarters at Camagüey, Cienfuegos&#x27; plane disappeared over the Straits of Florida. After a few days of an attempted search and rescue operation, he was presumed dead by the Cuban government. His disappearance quickly spawned a number of conspiracy theories, many of which speculated Fidel or Raúl Castro to have been responsible, but no proof of such has been discovered. Cienfuegos has since become known as a revolutionary martyr in Cuba, with a number of institutions being dedicated to his name, including a Military Schools System and an Order of Merit.

Cienfuegos was a popular figure in Cuba, due to his cheerful and carefree personality, which contrasted sharply with the strict austerity of his comrade Guevara. Although he was claimed by different factions to have been a communist, an anti-communist or an anarchist, he never publicly expressed any political ideology. The soldiers that fought for him remembered him for his friendly and paternal leadership style, while the Cuban government upheld him as a loyal supporter of Fidel Castro. Every year, on 28 October, Cuban children throw flowers into the rivers and seas, in tribute to him.

==Early life==
In 1932, Camilo Cienfuegos was born into a working-class family, the son of Spanish anarchists who had immigrated to Cuba. His father Ramón Cienfuegos worked as a tailor in Havana and was involved in left-wing political activism, working with Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA) and the Asociacíon Libertaria de Cuba (ALC). While Camilo was still an infant, his father took him along with him to raise money for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War.

Camilo&#x27;s older brother Osmany Cienfuegos, who had graduated as an architect, became a communist activist, at a time when student dissidents were highly active and increasingly being repressed by the anti-communist regime of Fulgencio Batista. Having himself enrolled in an art school to study sculpture, in December 1955, Camilo participated in a series of student demonstrations that were violently broken up by the authorities. After laying a wreath at a monument to Antonio Maceo, while walking back to their university, he and his fellow students were shot and wounded by police. He was eventually forced to drop out of school due to financial difficulties and began working at the same clothing shop as his father. He also briefly emigrated to the United States, where he worked illegally for a period. In 1956, Cienfuegos moved to Mexico and joined Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement for its expedition back to Cuba.

==Guerrilla activities==
===Landing and first offensive===

After the landing of the Granma on 2 December 1956, 26 July Movement made its way into the Sierra Maestra, where they were by the Cuban National Army on 5 December. Many of the guerrillas were captured and killed, forcing the rest to escape into the mountains. Cienfuegos&#x27; small group wandered around the area for days, eventually being pointed in Castro&#x27;s direction by local peasants. He found himself to be one of only twelve men that had survived the initial expedition.

During the set up for an ambush of the National Army, Cienfuegos accidentally almost shot Che Guevara, who was disguised as a National Army officer. Despite this mistake, the ambush went ahead successfully. The ranks of the rebels soon grew, as they gained the support of the local peasantry. Relations with new recruits didn&#x27;t start off well, as the veterans were frustrated by their lack of experience, knowledge and proper equipment. This larger revolutionary armed force was divided into three companies, while Cienfuegos took command of a small special vanguard unit. It was also brought under the command of an inner council, of which Cienfuegos was also a member. With Fidel Castro as commander-in-chief, all of the leading commanders of the revolutionary armed forces shared equal rank: that of major.

In March 1957, the National Army initiated a counter-offensive against the rebels, confidently declaring victory over them by early April. Within weeks, the rebels returned to Pico Turquino, supported by the local population. There they made efforts to combat the chronic malnutrition and illness of the peasantry, carried out agrarian reform and taught classes on Marxist theory. By May 1957, the rebels were marching east, planning to launch another attack against the army. With Castro having appointed Cienfuegos as commander of the Second Column, on 28 May, the rebels surrounded the Uvero barracks and began firing on it. Despite some losses, the rebels were victorious and quickly looted the barracks, taking supplies and prisoners of war back into the mountains with them.

===In Guevara&#x27;s Column===

With the rebellion well under way, both the National and Revolutionary armies were now attempting to assert their rule over the Sierra Maestra. In the absence of firm state control, the region fell into chaos, as various armed groups committed a litany of abuses. The rebels themselves had a code of conduct and Che Guevara in particular was committed to strict discipline, which caused tensions with the recruits when rebel commander Lalo Sardiñas shot a disobedient soldier. Castro defended the killing as a disciplinary action, managing to persuade a majority of the soldiers to vote for his demotion. Many of those in the minority that had wanted to see him executed subsequently left the rebel forces.

Sardiñas was stripped of command and replaced by Cienfuegos, who was made captain of Guevara&#x27;s vanguard platoon. Cienfuegos&#x27; and Guevara&#x27;s leadership styles proved complementary, as &quot;Camilo&#x27;s personality helped offset Che&#x27;s strictness&quot;, and the two became fast friends. Castro ordered Cienfuegos to pursue and neutralise a group of &quot;bandits&quot;, who they wanted to try for abuses being committed under the revolutionary banner. The column went to Mount Caracas, where they captured the Chinese Cuban bandit leader Chino Chang, tried him by revolutionary tribunal and executed him. Three of Chang&#x27;s young followers were subjected to a mock execution, after which they were invited to join the revolutionary army. They also captured and executed some young bandits that had stolen from the revolutionaries, as well as a rapist that had impersonated Guevara. When interviewed about the executions, Castro downplayed the number and justified the documented cases. In October 1957, Guevara pulled back and began looking to establish industrial infrastructure in the region, so that the guerrilla war could be materially sustained. Before long, the revolutionaries had managed to establish an entire insurgent economy in El Hombrito, complete with a dam, a hospital, farms, factories and workshops.
The following month, they received news that Ángel Sánchez Mosquera was leading the National Army through the adjacent valley and destroying the local peasantry&#x27;s homes there. Cienfuegos was dispatched to ambush them from behind, but the engagement was quick and only resulted in one National soldier&#x27;s death before both sides withdrew. Cienfuegos then attempted a second attack, taking up position near the National Army camp while waiting for reinforcements from Guevara&#x27;s column. On 29 November, the rebels set their ambush, covering all routes of escape and concealing themselves in the trees. Most of the National Army soldiers were gunned down in the farmhouse they were stationed in, while guerrilla patrols attempted to hold back reinforcements from arriving. After a bloody day of fighting, the rebels were forced to retreat, having lost a number of men. They were pursued along the way by Sánchez Mosquera&#x27;s forces, as their defensive lines collapsed.

Again, they attempted to set up an ambush. Cienfuegos was to fire the starting shot at point-blank range from behind a tree, following which partially-concealed sharpshooters would open fire on the road. During the subsequent fire fight, Guevara was hit in the foot, lost his rifle and was again forced to pull back. Guevara went to request urgent reinforcements from Castro, but found that the National Army had withdrawn from the area. He was initially pleased and after his foot was operated on, returned to his base camp in El Hombrito, which he found completely destroyed. As the new year of 1958 dawned, Guevara&#x27;s column began establishing a new base camp in La Mesa.

In February 1958, Guevara&#x27;s armory began preparing supplies for the rebel forces&#x27; first offensive of the year, a planned attack on a National Army company at Pino del Agua. On 16 February, the rebels attacked the army camp with explosives, overrunning the guard posts. After initial rebel successes, National reinforcements arrived and Cienfuegos was shot twice, while attempting to retrieve a machine gun. At Guevara&#x27;s command, the rebels attempted to rout the National Army, but ultimately decided to pull back as they did not have support from the wounded Cienfuegos. The rebels retreated into the hills again, where they carried out a series of sabotage attacks against the army.

===Independent command===
With rebel activity increasing around the country, Castro moved to extend their theatre of operations. On 27 February, he appointed Cienfuegos, Juan Almeida and Raúl Castro to command their own columns. While Raúl and Almeida were dispatched to carry out guerrilla activities in Oriente, Cienfuegos was left to recover from his wounds. Meanwhile, Castro himself began consolidating his authority within the &quot;free territory&quot; that had been carved out of the Sierra Maestra.

In March 1958, the Catholic Church in Cuba began calling for peace negotiations and the formation of a national unity government, but the initiative was rejected by Castro. As Fulgencio Batista attempted to salvage the situation, the 26 July Movement and the Revolutionary Directorate signed a joint manifesto on 12 March, which called for a general strike and &quot;total war&quot; against the Batista regime. However, the call for a general strike was disregarded by the trade unions, as many workplaces remained open and any workers taking strike action were shot by Batista&#x27;s death squads. The failure of the general strike was a blow to the revolutionaries, with different factions blaming each other, while Batista received new arms shipments from Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo. In response, 26 July Movement and the Popular Socialist Party formed an alliance against the regime, with many communists joining the army.

On 16 April, Cienfuegos returned to active combat in the Sierra, with Castro appointing him as commander of the guerrilla warfare in the area between Bayamo, Manzanillo and Las Tunas. There he was directed to sabotage the National Army, take over supply lines, implement agrarian reform and a new civil code. Castro aimed to defend Sierra Maestra, as it became clear that Batista was planning a new offensive. Castro and Guevara subsequently moved their headquarters into the hills, where they clashed with Sánchez Mosquera&#x27;s forces. After Guevara had set up camp, Castro tasked him with establishing and running a military school in order to train new recruits. He had hoped to reunite on the front lines with Cienfuegos, who consoled his friend with a letter:


On 24 May 1958, the National Army launched Operation Verano, an offensive into the Sierra that aimed to cut off Castro&#x27;s supply lines and weaken his forces. When the National Army advanced in the foothills along the northern front, Castro was forced to withdraw all of his forces from the south, as he only had 300 soldiers for the defense. On 26 June, Cienfuegos&#x27; patrol group was recalled from Holguín, in order to reinforce the revolutionary forces against the national offensive. The revolutionaries were then able to continuously ambush the army, which mostly focused on guarding coffee and sugar plantations, while their own insurgent economy only grew.

===Las Villas Operation===
By August 1958, the National Army had finally withdrawn from the Sierra and Castro began to plan new offensive operations. By this time, independent insurrections had broken out in the Escambray Mountains of Central Cuba. Castro decided to send Che Guevara and Cienfuegos west, in an attempt to bring the direction of the fighting under their command. Cienfuegos himself was directed to lead his 82-strong Antonio Maceo Column across the island towards Pinar del Río, in emulation of his column&#x27;s namesake.

Together with Guevara&#x27;s own column, they left the revolutionary headquarters on foot, as their vehicles had been rendered useless by a National Army ambush. The two columns travelled together for a while, wading through rice paddies and swamps, while attempting to evade the National Army and any aerial bombardment. They advanced into Camagüey on 7 September and clashed with the National Army at Santa Cruz del Sur. The revolutionaries pressed on despite the poor conditions of the expedition, with Cienfuegos reporting in October:

During the &quot;Westward March of Che and Camilo&quot;, the revolutionaries took control of a number of towns, cities and transportation hubs. Further clashes occurred during the expedition and sometimes it was necessary to stop and dispense justice, with Cienfuegos being noted to have shot two of his men for looting. In Camagüey, they received assistance from local communists, who helped produce propaganda leaflets for 26 July Movement.
Before the arrival of Guevara and Cienfuegos in Las Villas, the insurrection there was mostly directed by independent groups such as the Revolutionary Directorate and the Second National Front of Escambray, as well as small detachments of the Popular Socialist Party and 26 July Movement. Although these groups had accomplished little before, the new leadership of Guevara and Cienfuegos would transform the revolutionary situation in Las Villas and prove instrumental to the adhesion of the Communists to the movement. Cienfuegos&#x27; and Guevara&#x27;s columns arrived in Las Villas on 14 October 1958, gaining strength from National Army deserters and local 26 July Movement activists along the way. There Cienfuegos&#x27; column was joined by another commanded by the Communist Félix Torres, who subordinated himself to Cienfuegos&#x27; command. Together they clashed with a 450-strong detachment of the National Army and faced difficulties with a local unit of the Revolutionary Directorate, with Enrique Oltuski coming to them from Trinidad, in Sancti Spíritus Province, to mediate the dispute, and in the process meeting Guevara and Cienfuegos.

Cienfuegos&#x27; column was supplied with provisions by the local communist militants such as Armando Acosta, who became Guevara&#x27;s personal aide. Cienfuegos spent much of his time there organising regular collective reading sessions, dedicated to studying the works of Cuban national heroes José Martí and Antonio Maceo, the latter of whom Cienfuegos read aloud himself &quot;in a deep voice&quot;. The revolutionaries also implemented a programme of agrarian reform in Las Villas, with Cienfuegos organising local sugar workers to hold a national conference later in the year. As Guevara attempted to form an alliance with the Directorate, Cienfuegos apparently displayed &quot;no eagerness&quot; to move on to his destination of Pinar del Río.

When the 1958 Cuban general election was held, Guevara and Cienfuegos organised a boycott in Las Villas and attempted to prevent voting urns from being brought to the province. Cienfuegos was ordered to attack towns in the north of the province, which succeeded in bringing provincial traffic to a standstill on the day of the election. In an attempt to appeal for US support, president-elect Andrés Rivero Agüero initially promised to negotiate a peaceful solution to the political crisis in the country, but quickly re-committed to Batista&#x27;s plan of forcefully suppressing the uprising.

In November 1958, the National Air Force began bombarding Guevara&#x27;s forces daily and the National Army moved several heavily armed companies towards their positions. Cienfuegos brought his Column to reinforce Guevara and the two sides battled for a week. On 4 December 1958, the National Army&#x27;s offensive was halted and they were then pushed back to Fomento, with the revolutionaries capturing a large amount of territory and materiel. As Cienfuegos and Guevara continued to see success against the National Army, Cienfuegos&#x27; column was ordered to remain in the province, rather than pushing on to Pinar del Río.
Instead, Cienfuegos and Guevara aimed to cut the island in half by definitively capturing the province. Guevara captured Fomento on 18 December, and Cabaiguán and Guayos on 21 December, before moving on to capture the junction at Placetas. By Christmas Day, they had captured most of the province, leaving only the major cities in the hands of the regime. Meanwhile, Cienfuegos&#x27; column moved to the north of the province and launched an attack on the National Army garrison at Yaguajay. During the ensuing Battle of Yaguajay, Cienfuegos&#x27; column captured 250 men and 375 rifles, before moving on.

This offensive proved to be the coup de grâce of the Batista regime, with the President himself deciding to flee the country. By the end of December 1958, Las Villas was completely under revolutionary control, cutting communications between the National Army in the east and the west. Guevara then began making preparations for their final campaign. Guevara and Cienfuegos received orders from Castro, directing them to advance on Havana, while specifying that it &quot;be carried out exclusively by the 26th of July forces. Camilo&#x27;s column should be in the lead, the vanguard, to take over Havana when the dictatorship falls, if we don&#x27;t want the weapons from Camp Columbia [military headquarters] to be distributed among all the various groups, which would present a very serious problem in the future.&quot;

===Revolutionary victory===
On 2 January 1959, Cienfuegos&#x27; and Guevara&#x27;s columns finally moved on the Cuban capital of Havana, with Guevara capturing the fortress of La Cabaña. That day, Cienfuegos&#x27; column arrived at Matanzas, where they accepted the unconditional surrender of the local regiment. The soldiers were disarmed of their rifles but allowed by Cienfuegos to keep their pistols. Cienfuegos&#x27; column then moved on and occupied Camp Columbia in Havana, which Cienfuegos received command over from Ramón Barquín. When Carlos Franqui arrived in Havana, he reported of Cienfuegos&#x27; Camp Columbia that:


The following day, 26 July Movement called for a general strike to mark the final blow to the Batista regime, with the old institutions falling to the revolution with each passing hour. As Batista&#x27;s former soldiers defected to the revolution, the newly installed revolutionary president Manuel Urrutia appointed Cienfuegos as commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. On 5 January, Cienfuegos welcomed members of the new revolutionary Council of Ministers as they arrived in Havana, where they awaited Castro.

While Castro delayed in reaching the capital, Cienfuegos became the public face of the revolution in Havana. When visited in Camp Columbia by television reporters, who broadcast the interaction to thousands of viewers, he made a point to release a number of parrots from their birdcages, declaring &quot;these also have a right to liberty&quot;. Cienfuegos&#x27; &quot;easy manners&quot; quickly became emblematic of the revolutionaries, who Havana was pleasantly surprised to find on good behavior; neither drinking alcohol nor looting the city after its capture. Due to the saturation of radio and television access in Cuba, before long, &quot;everyone knew who Camilo Cienfuegos was&quot; and could easily identify the rebel commander. Castro himself preferred Cienfuegos taking the center stage over the foreign communist Guevara, as the &quot;handsome, Stetson-wearing, baseball-playing, womanizing, humorous Camilo was Cuban, not known to be a Communist, and had already become a popular folk hero.&quot;
Tensions had not yet subsided, as the Revolutionary Directorate held on to the Presidential Palace and refused to vacate it for the arrival of the new president, with Cienfuegos considering an attack against the palace. According to Franqui: &quot;Camilo, half joking and half serious, said a couple of cannonballs should be fired off as a warning. [...] As I was not an admirer of the palace, I said it seemed like a good idea, but Che, with his sense of responsibility, told us it wasn&#x27;t the right time to waste cannonballs, and he patiently returned to the palace, met Faure Chomón, and matters were straightened out. Camilo always listened to Che.&quot; The situation was thus diffused and the palace was peacefully handed over to Urrutia. On 8 January, Fidel Castro finally arrived in Havana, meeting with Urrutia at the presidential palace and giving a speech at Cienfuegos&#x27; Camp Columbia. During the rally, Castro interrupted his speech to ask Cienfuegos &quot;&quot;¿Voy bien, Camilo?&quot; () Cienfuegos responded in kind, &quot;Vas bien, Fidel!&quot;&quot; ()

==After the Revolution==
===Initial activities===
In the wake of the revolution, most political parties dissolved themselves voluntarily, hoping to make way for a &quot;new political order&quot;. By 10 January 1959, Cienfuegos had legalized the Popular Socialist Party (PSP), declaring that it &quot;would have rights to organize themselves like all other democratic parties providing that they did not represent the interests of a foreign power&quot;. Che supported Cienfuegos&#x27; decision, himself considering the PSP to have proven themselves worthy of participating in the government and aiding them in their early operations. Meanwhile, Camilo solicited his brother Osmany Cienfuegos, a member of the PSP, to establish a Cultural Section of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that would oversee the Cuban literacy campaign. According to Julio García Espinosa, Cienfuegos also commissioned a number of PSP members as officers in the army, even though they hadn&#x27;t fought in the war. Cienfuegos also participated in talks between 26 July Movement and the Popular Socialist Party, which aimed at merging the two organisations.

Having declared victory for the Revolution, Cienfuegos never ended up taking an official position within the government. He instead preferred to enjoy Havana&#x27;s nightlife, going to clubs and reveling in his status as &quot;the spoiled darling of the masses&quot;. In February 1959, Cienfuegos surprised Guevara by arranging a free flight for Guevara&#x27;s family to come see him from Argentina. If Guevara had known about it, he may not have allowed it, due to his self-imposed austerity. When Guevara married Aleida March on 2 June, Cienfuegos arrived with bottles of rum &quot;to liven up&quot; the wedding reception. Shortly after the wedding, Guevara went to Egypt to meet with state representatives of the Bandung Pact. While away, Guevara&#x27;s men began to worry that he had been removed by Castro, protesting to Cienfuegos when an unpopular commander was named as his substitute. But Cienfuegos proved unmoved by their complaints and reprimanded the soldiers for not obeying orders.
On the anniversary of the attack on the Moncada Barracks that had started the Revolution, the revolutionary government went to mass, where they commemorated those that fell during the revolution, before presiding over a mass demonstration at Plaza de la Revolución, followed by a military parade. Later that night, they held a baseball game at the Estadio Latinoamericano, where Cienfuegos and Castro played for a team called &quot;Los Barbudos&quot; (). Baseball quickly became a fixture of post-revolutionary Cuban culture, with United States ambassador Philip Bonsal observing: &quot;The spectacle of the Prime Minister, alleged by his admirers to have been a promising pitcher of big league caliber, throwing a few curves to Major Camilo Cienfuegos, a former minor-leaguer, and generally clowning about on the diamond was a feature of the pregame show of many important contests.&quot;

===Consolidation of the Revolution===
Before long, Cienfuegos was observing the beginnings of Castro&#x27;s consolidation of power. Castro quickly tasked Cienfuegos, Ramiro Valdés and Victor Pina with establishing a new Intelligence Directorate, which Valdés took charge of. Castro also began reorganizing the armed forces, purging the officers of the old National Army and replacing them with a new military elite of ex-guerrillas that were personally loyal to Castro.

Although Cienfuegos originally envisioned an equitable merger of the Revolutionary and National Armies, Castro quickly convinced him that it was &quot;necessary to reorganize the armed forces with men loyal to the Revolution, and not accomplices of tyranny.&quot; In the process, Cienfuegos was appointed as the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, replacing Colonel José Rego Rubido. In September 1959, Cienfuegos joined the Castro brothers in going to Santa Clara, where they sacked the provincial heads of 26 July Movement, the revolutionary army and Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria (INRA), replacing them with more loyal supporters of Castro.

During this time, Castro also dispatched a group of 200 Dominicans and 10 Cuban guerrillas to invade the Dominican Republic and oust Rafael Trujillo. Almost all of them were captured, tortured and killed. Before it was carried out, Sacha Volman had begged Cienfuegos to call off the expedition, fearing it to be doomed. Cienfuegos agreed and attempted to convince Castro to call it off, but he pushed forward with the plan. Volman later claimed that the expedition was &quot;set up to fail&quot;.

The conflict between Castro and the liberal president Manuel Urrutia, in which the former rallied his supporters to oust the latter, lay the foundations for the construction of an authoritarian state, with Castro dissolving all remaining institutions of civilian government. Cienfuegos complained during the events that &quot;[t]his Fidel really likes to fuck around&quot;.

===Huber Matos affair===
Castro&#x27;s consolidation of power, as well as the increasing role of the Popular Socialist Party in government, began to worry some officers in the Revolutionary Army. The provincial commander of Camagüey, Huber Matos, shared his own concerns with Cienfuegos, who promised to investigate the situation.
In October 1959, Raúl Castro was promoted to Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, formally demoting Cienfuegos, who had previously been his superior officer. This triggered the resignation of Huber Matos, who accused Fidel Castro of &quot;burying the revolution&quot;. Fidel responded by publicly denouncing Matos for treason. Cienfuegos, along with Guevara and President Osvaldo Dorticós, considered Castro&#x27;s denunciations of Matos to have been a mistake and attempted to persuade Fidel to be lenient while prosecuting him. When Raúl Castro ordered Cienfuegos to arrest Matos, he initially refused, only reluctantly accepting the order when Fidel gave it personally.

Fidel dispatched Cienfuegos to Camagüey, where he found that Matos&#x27; forces remained loyal to their commander. Matos ordered his officers to treat Cienfuegos&#x27; arrival with respect, so as to make it clear that there was no conspiracy against the government, but they instead resigned en masse. Cienfuegos arrested Matos and his fellow dissidents without resistance, refusing to handcuff his former comrade and walking side-by-side with him in front of the press. Matos was then taken back to Havana. Cienfuegos remained behind in Camagüey to take over Matos&#x27; command, overseeing the complete reorganization of the province&#x27;s armed forces.

===Disappearance===

On 28 October 1959, Cienfuegos&#x27; Cessna 310 took off from Camagüey, headed for Havana. Cienfuegos disappeared along the way, his plane apparently having been lost in the Caribbean Sea.

News of his disappearance was not reported until 30 October. When news of it was brought to the Cabinet by Raúl Castro, Fidel seemed surprised and visibly upset, and the government quickly ordered a search and rescue operation. Throughout the country, Catholics held mass processions in honour of Cienfuegos and the political leadership widely publicised their concern for their lost comrade. The military followed any leads they could, speaking with peasants that claimed to have witnessed a plane crash and even consulting a spiritualist. According to United States ambassador Philip Bonsal, he had provided a number of American planes to cooperate in the search efforts, but the Cuban government assigned them to a location where it was unlikely the plane could have been. Castro never mentioned American assistance in his report of the search efforts.

For publicity, Castro was filmed searching for Cienfuegos with his parents, who posed for pictures searching the skies for their lost son. But some of those who accompanied Castro on these search flights claimed that he never appeared to be emotionally invested in the search and seemed indifferent to Cienfuegos&#x27; fate. While himself investigating the disappearance, Cienfuegos&#x27; former aide Major Cristóbal Naranjo was murdered by Captain Manuel Beatón, apparently during a drunken argument after Beatón was passed over for a promotion. After escaping into the Sierra Maestra and becoming a bandit, Beatón was himself assassinated the following year, prompting many to suspect foul play in the disappearance of Cienfuegos.

Cienfuegos was falsely reported to have been found on 5 November, and work stopped throughout the country as people came out into the streets to celebrate. Ruby Hart Phillips reported that &quot;merchants were forced to close their stores because the clerks deserted. I was surprised to learn that Major Cienfuegos was so popular.&quot; Many Catholics credited Our Lady of Charity or Jude the Apostle for the miracle.

But in reality, no sign of a plane wreckage had actually been found. Hours after the report of Cienfuegos&#x27; discovery, the Revolutionary Armed Forces denied its validity, alleging it to have been counter-revolutionary propaganda that had aimed to assassinate Castro. The Cuban government subsequently declared Camilo Cienfuegos to be presumed dead. His body has never been discovered and the official story has neither been proven nor disproven.

While Matos was given a show trial by a revolutionary tribunal, Cienfuegos was made into a revolutionary martyr. Fidel Castro accelerated his consolidation of power after Cienfuegos&#x27; death, using it as a reason to convince Cubans of the need to &quot;defend the Revolution at all costs&quot;. This meant the end of judicial independence and the re-establishment of revolutionary tribunals, which expanded the definition of &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; by criminalising strike action, eliminating the category of &quot;political prisoner&quot; and assuming collective guilt by association. After the &quot;Prensa Libre&quot; reported on allegations of rising tensions between them and Cienfuegos, the Castros also began to campaign against freedom of the press.

==Character==
===Personality===

To Cuban-American historian Samuel Farber, Cienfuegos &quot;exemplified the quintessential native, male, urban Cuban with his sense of humor, great interest in dancing and baseball, good looks, love of women, and overall &quot;joie de vivre&quot;&quot;. According to British historian Hugh Thomas, Cienfuegos, &quot;with his open, jovial manner and warm smile, bid fair to become almost as popular as Castro himself&quot;. To American historian Robert E. Quirk, Cienfuegos&#x27; &quot;easygoing and friendly demeanor and Old Testament beard combined to project a popular counterimage alongside that of the July 26 leader.&quot;

United States ambassador Earl E. T. Smith, who met Cienfuegos at Camp Columbia in January 1959, thought him to be &quot;courteous if aloof&quot;. To Smith&#x27;s successor Philip Bonsal, &quot;Cienfuegos was gay and forthcoming. He had proved himself as a leader of men but he did not have any irresistible urge to the exercise of power. He liked the fleshpots, the gay life. He may have had a penchant for friendships and associations deemed undesirable by some of his more austere revolutionary comrades.&quot; While to the British ambassador Leycester Coltman &quot;Camilo&#x27;s austere figure, black beard and gentle, dignified manner gave him an even more Christ-like appearance than Castro.&quot;

Finance Minister Raúl Chibás described him as &quot;a childlike fellow, always playing with guns&quot;, while his successor Rufo López-Fresquet described him as a &quot;gay, happy-go-lucky, adventuresome sort&quot;. The newspaper &quot;Bohemia&quot; also compared him to Robinson Crusoe. Cienfuegos&#x27; &quot;devil-may-care personality&quot; was often contrasted with Guevara&#x27;s &quot;strictness&quot;, although the two would become fast friends after joining the revolutionary leadership.

===Political ideology===

Cienfuegos wasn&#x27;t openly committed to any political ideology and appeared not to hold any strong political beliefs, although he remained personally loyal to Castro. Farber commented that he &quot;remained less politically sophisticated than the Castro brothers as well as Che Guevara.&quot; Cienfuegos himself considered the Cuban Revolution to have been anti-authoritarian and &quot;non-Communist&quot;, and continued to reiterate this view even after Castro&#x27;s line on the matter changed. To Cienfuegos, the Revolution was &quot;&quot;cubanísima&quot; [Cuban to the extreme] [...] as Cuban as the palm trees, uniquely and exclusively Cuban.&quot; This was the version of the revolution that he vowed to die for &quot;whenever the moment should demand it&quot;.

Many have speculated about his possible communist allegiances, but no solid evidence of such has been found. Although described as a &quot;closet Communist&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Tad Szulc, to Castro&#x27;s biographer Georgie Anne Geyer, &quot;[t]hat Camilo was far more a romantic revolutionary than a Communist is beyond question.&quot; While Fidel Castro himself described Cienfuegos as &quot;a pure revolutionary soul, Communist timber&quot;, he also speculated that he could have been removed from command due to his &quot;low political level&quot;. Others claimed him to be an anti-communist or referred to him in neutral terms. Some have also pointed out the influence of his older brother Osmany Cienfuegos, who was a committed communist.

The son of Spanish anarchists, many within the international anarchist movement claimed Cienfuegos himself to have also been an anarchist. The Cuban government even played up his libertarian credentials in order to garner international support. But Cuban-American historian Frank Fernández has disputed this characterisation, questioning whether Cienfuegos was ever involved with the Cuban anarchist movement.

===Leadership style===

During the Cuban Revolution, he quickly distinguished himself as one of the most popular revolutionary leaders. As a key lieutenant of Fidel Castro, Cienfuegos was comparable in rank and fame to Che Guevara and Raúl Castro, in some cases even being considered second only to Fidel himself. Although his campaign in Las Villas was not as well-conducted as Guevara&#x27;s, Cienfuegos&#x27; actions in the last months of the war earned him particular distinction as a revolutionary leader.

While a capable military commander, Cienfuegos never demonstrated an authoritarian desire to exercise power over others. After the revolution, Cienfuegos was remembered fondly by his soldiers, who compared his affectionate leadership style to that of a parent or a teacher, rather than that of a &quot;chief&quot;, recalling that &quot;he even insisted that prisoners should eat first&quot;. On the question of tactics, he departed from many others in the revolutionary movement in rejecting violence and revenge. In October 1958, when a Cuban Masonic organization expressed concern that someone captured by the rebels might be tortured and killed, he replied that he wouldn&#x27;t even have considered such an act, which he thought would have lowered the revolutionaries&#x27; methods to the level of their opponents.

==Legacy==

===Speculation about disappearance===
Almost immediately after Cienfuegos disappeared, many people began to speculate about the events and some even suspected foul play. The pilot of Cienfuegos&#x27; plane had been inexperienced, and although the government claimed that the plane had been taken down by a squall, the weather that day had actually been clear for flying. The area that his plane was flying would also have been covered by radar. The captain of the base that Cienfuegos&#x27; plane took off from, Roberto de Cárdenas, alleged that the flight&#x27;s fate had been plotted, claiming that nobody had seen Cienfuegos in the airplane and that others on the base were either killed or overpowered.
Some alleged he had been assassinated by his rival Raúl Castro. Proponents of this hypothesis included Huber Matos himself, who was convinced that his arrest and Camilo&#x27;s disappearance were related. Carlos Franqui suspected the intelligence agent Osvaldo Sánchez, who had been charged with ensuring the security of Cienfuegos by Raúl Castro. Others suspected that Fidel Castro himself ordered the assassination of Cienfuegos, speculating that it had something to do with his apparent reluctance to arrest Matos, or that Cienfuegos was growing too popular for Castro&#x27;s liking. Some skeptics speculated that Castro had falsely announced that Cienfuegos was found in order to gauge the public&#x27;s feelings about him.

Some critics of Castro claimed that while he had not killed Cienfuegos himself, &quot;one of the specialties of Fidel is to send people to be killed.&quot; José Pardo Llada, who was with Castro during the search for Cienfuegos, later said that &quot;He [Castro] may not have killed Camilo, but he certainly didn&#x27;t feel his death&quot;. Che Guevara himself never suspected the Castros of involvement in Cienfuegos&#x27; disappearance and remained personally loyal to Fidel for years afterwards. Philip Bonsal also never considered foul play by the Castros to have been a possibility, as he believed that &quot;Cienfuegos was no threat to any one.&quot;

Another speculation was that his plane had been mistaken for a hostile aircraft and shot down by a Cuban Air Force pilot. There has also been speculation that Cienfuegos faked his death and fled to the US, as some speculate it may have been to Ybor City in Tampa. In 1960, a former nurse from Havana that had fled to Miami claimed she had nursed Cienfuegos, but she was later declared &quot;insane&quot;. British historian Hugh Thomas himself speculated whether the mystery of Cienfuegos&#x27; disappearance would ever be solved.

===Friends and family===
Shortly after Camilo&#x27;s death, his brother Osmany Cienfuegos was appointed as Minister of Public Works, replacing the engineer Manuel Ray Rivero. He served in the position until February 1966, when he was appointed as president of the Communist Party&#x27;s foreign relations commission. He also joined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and, in 1976, became a member of the Council of State and secretary of the Council of Ministers.

Che Guevara named his son Camilo after Cienfuegos and kept a picture of him on his study wall after leaving Cuba. Guevara also dedicated his 1961 book &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot; to Cienfuegos, a picture of whom adorned the cover.

===Memorial dedications===

On 28 October each year, school children throughout Cuba throw flowers into the sea or a river to honor Camilo Cienfuegos, repeating the spontaneous tribute of the Cubans who tossed flowers into the ocean when they heard his plane had been lost over the Cuba Florida Strait. To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, on 28 October 2009, a steel outline of Cienfuegos&#x27; face and the words &quot;Vas bien, Fidel&quot; were added to the side of the building on the Plaza de la Revolución.
After the revolution, streets and buildings throughout Cuba were renamed after heroes of the Revolution, including Cienfuegos himself. A village previously known as &quot;Hershey&quot;, in the municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, was renamed to Camilo Cienfuegos in his honour. A museum dedicated to Cienfuegos was built in Yaguajay, at the site of the barracks of the Batista&#x27;s forces during the 1958 battle. The museum includes a diorama of the battle, as well as material relating to Cienfuegos&#x27; life before, during, and after the revolution. A large statue of him stands in front of the museum.

As part of a campaign to improve the standards of living in rural areas, in July 1960, Fidel Castro dedicated the Camilo Cienfuegos Mountain Boarding School, which was established as a school for the largely-uneducated peasant children of the Sierra Maestra. In 1966, the Camilo Cienfuegos Military Schools System was also established to provide military education to students aged 11 to 17. Graduates from these high schools received priority admission to cadet schools, such that within five years, 74% of students at the military technological institute were graduates from the Camilo Cienfuegos Schools. The University of Matanzas also bears the name &quot;Camilo Cienfuegos&quot;.

On 10 December 1979, the Cuban government decreed the establishment of the Order of Cienfuegos, a socialist order of merit named in his honour. Camilo is also remembered on the 20 Cuban peso bill and the 20 Cuban convertible peso bill. He was also pictured on the 40-cent coins, now discontinued.

===Popular culture===
Cienfuegos has also been depicted on revolutionary murals, which sometimes assigned to him a religious significance. In the 2008 film &quot;Che&quot;, the character of Cienfuegos was &quot;played with great verve&quot; by Santiago Cabrera.

<text>John Hunyadi (; ; ; ; – 11 August 1456) was a leading Hungarian military and political figure during the 15th century, who served as regent of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1446 to 1453, under the minor Ladislaus V.

According to most contemporary sources, he was the member of a noble family of Wallachian ancestry. Through his struggles against the Ottoman Empire, he earned for himself the nickname &quot;Turk-buster&quot; from his contemporaries. Due to his merits, he quickly received substantial land grants. By the time of his death, he was the owner of immense land areas, totaling approximately four million cadastral acres, which had no precedent before or after in the Kingdom of Hungary. His enormous wealth and his military and political weight were primarily directed towards the purposes of the Ottoman wars.

Hunyadi mastered his military skills on the southern borderlands of the Kingdom of Hungary that were exposed to Ottoman attacks. Appointed Ban of Szörény in 1439, appointed Voivode of Transylvania, Counts of the Székelys and Chief Captain of Nándorfehérvár (now Belgrade) in 1441 and head of several southern counties of the Kingdom of Hungary, he assumed responsibility for the defense of the frontiers. He adopted the Hussite method of using wagons for military purposes. He employed professional soldiers, but also mobilized local peasantry against invaders. These innovations contributed to his earliest successes against the Ottoman troops who were plundering the southern marches in the early 1440s.

In 1442, Hunyadi won four victories against the Ottomans, two of which were decisive. In March 1442, Hunyadi defeated Mezid Bey and the raiding Ottoman army at the Battle of Szeben in the south part of the Kingdom of Hungary in Transylvania. In September 1442, Hunyadi defeated a large Ottoman army of Beylerbey Şehabeddin, the Provincial Governor of Rumelia. This was the first time that a European army defeated such a large Ottoman force, composed not only of raiders, but of the provincial cavalry led by their own sanjak beys (governors) and accompanied by the formidable janissaries. Although defeated in the battle of Varna in 1444 and in the second battle of Kosovo in 1448, his successful &quot;Long Campaign&quot; across the Balkan Mountains in 1443–44 and defence of Belgrade (Nándorfehérvár) in 1456, against troops led personally by the sultan, established his reputation as a great general. The pope ordered that European churches ring their bells at noon to gather the faithful in prayer for those who were fighting. The bells of Christian churches are rung at noon to commemorate the Belgrade victory.

John Hunyadi was also an eminent statesman. He actively took part in the civil war between the partisans of Wladislas I and the minor Ladislaus V, two claimants to the throne of Hungary in the early 1440s, on behalf of the former. He was popular among the lesser nobility, and in 1445 the Diet of Hungary appointed him one of the seven &quot;Captains in Chief&quot; responsible for the administration of state affairs until Ladislaus V (by that time unanimously accepted as king) came of age. The next Diet went even further, electing Hunyadi as sole regent with the title of governor. When he resigned from this office in 1452, the sovereign awarded him with the first hereditary title in the Kingdom of Hungary, &quot;(perpetual count of Beszterce/Bistrița&quot;). He had by this time become one of the wealthiest landowners in the kingdom, and preserved his influence in the Diet up until his death.

This &quot;Athleta Christi&quot; (Christ&#x27;s Champion), as Pope Pius II referred to him, died some three weeks after his triumph at Belgrade, falling to an epidemic that had broken out in the crusader camp. However, his victories over the Turks prevented them from invading the Kingdom of Hungary for more than 60 years. His fame was a decisive factor in the election of his son, Matthias Corvinus, as king by the Diet of 1457. Hunyadi is a popular historical figure among Hungarians, Romanians, Serbs, Bulgarians, and other nations of the region.

==Childhood ( 1406 – 1420)==

A royal charter of grant issued on 18 October 1409 contains the first reference to John Hunyadi. In the document, King Sigismund of Hungary bestowed Hunyad Castle (in present-day Hunedoara, Romania) and the lands attached to it upon John&#x27;s father, Voyk and Voyk&#x27;s four kinsmen, including John himself. According to the document, John&#x27;s father served in the royal household as a &quot;court knight&quot; at that time, suggesting that he was descended from a respected family. Two 15th-century chroniclersJohannes de Thurocz and Antonio Bonfiniwrite that Voyk had moved from Wallachia to Hungary upon King Sigismund&#x27;s initiative. László Makkai, Malcolm Hebron, Pál Engel and other scholars accept the two chroniclers&#x27; report of the Wallachian origin of John Hunyadi&#x27;s father. In contrast with them, Ioan-Aurel Pop says that Voyk was a native of the wider region of Hunyad Castle.

Antonio Bonfini was the first chronicler to have made a passing remark of an alternative story of John Hunyadi&#x27;s parentage, soon stating that it was just a &quot;tasteless tale&quot; fabricated by Hunyadi&#x27;s opponent, Ulrich II, Count of Celje. According to this anecdote, John was actually not Voyk&#x27;s child, but King Sigismund&#x27;s illegitimate son. The story became especially popular during the reign of John Hunyadi&#x27;s son, Matthias Corvinus who erected a statue for King Sigismund in Buda. The 16th-century chronicler Gáspár Heltai repeated and further developed the tale, but modern scholarsfor instance, Cartledge, and Kubinyiregard it as an unverifiable gossip. Hunyadi&#x27;s popularity among the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula give rise to further legends of his royal parentage.

The identification of John Hunyadi&#x27;s mother is even less certain. In connection with King Sigismund&#x27;s supposed parentage, both Bonfini and Heltai say that she was the daughter of a rich boyar, or nobleman, whose estates were located at Morzsina (present-day Margina, Romania). Pop proposes that she was called Elisabeth. According to historian László Makkai, John Hunyadi&#x27;s mother was a member of the Muzsina (or Mușina) kenez family from Demsus (Densuș, Romania), but Pop refuses the identification of the Morzsina and Muzsina families.

With regard of John Hunyadi&#x27;s mother, Bonfini provides an alternative solution as well, stating that she was a distinguished Greek lady, but does not name her. According to Kubinyi, her alleged Greek origin may simply refer to her Orthodox faith. In a letter of 1489, Matthias Corvinus wrote that his grandmother&#x27;s sister, whom the Ottoman Turks had captured and forced to join the harem of an unnamed Sultan, became the ancestor of Cem, the rebellious son of Sultan Mehmed II. Based on this letter, historian Kubinyi says that the &quot;Greek connection cannot be discounted entirely&quot;. If Matthias Corvinus&#x27; report is valid, John Hunyadithe hero of anti-Ottoman warsand the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II were first cousins. On the other hand, historian Péter E. Kovács writes that Matthias Corvinus&#x27;s story about his family connection with the Ottoman Sultans was nothing but a pack of lies.

Hunyadi&#x27;s year of birth is uncertain. Although Gáspár Heltai writes that Hunyadi was born in 1390, he must have actually been born between around 1405 and 1407, because his younger brother was only born after 1409, and a difference of almost two decades between the two brothers&#x27; age is not plausible. The place of his birth is likewise unknown. The 16th-century scholar, Antun Vrančić wrote that John Hunyadi had been &quot;a native&quot; of the &quot;Hátszeg region&quot; (now Țara Hațegului in Romania). Hunyadi&#x27;s father died before 12 February 1419. A royal charter issued on this day mentions Hunyadi, Hunyadi&#x27;s two brothers (John the younger and Voyk) and their uncle Radol, but does not refer to their father.

== Rise of a general ==
=== Youth ( 1420–1438) ===
Andreas Pannonius, who served Hunyadi for five years, wrote that the future commander &quot;accustomed himself to tolerate both cold and heat in good time&quot;. Like other young noblemen, John Hunyadi spent his youth serving in the court of powerful magnates. However, the exact list of his employers cannot be completed, because 15th-century authors recorded contradictory data on his early life.

Filippo Scolari&#x27;s biographer, Poggio Bracciolini writes that Scolariwho was responsible for the defense of the southern frontier as &quot;Ispán&quot;, or head, of Temes Countyeducated Hunyadi from his very youth, suggesting that Hunyadi was Scolari&#x27;s page around 1420. On the other hand, John of Capistrano writes, in a letter of 1456, that Hunyadi started his military career serving under Nicholas of Ilok. For Nicholas of Ilok was at least six year younger than Hunyadi, historian Pál Engel writes that Capistrano confused him with his brother, Stephen of Ilok. Finally, Antonio Bonfini says that at the beginning of his career Hunyadi worked either for Demeter Csupor, Bishop of Zagreb or for the Csákys.

According to the Byzantine historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, the young Hunyadi &quot;stayed for a time&quot; at the court of Stefan Lazarević, Despot of Serbia, who died in 1427. Hunyadi&#x27;s marriage with Elisabeth Szilágyi substantiates Chalkokondyles&#x27; report, because her father, Ladislaus was the Despot&#x27;s &quot;familiaris&quot; around 1426. The wedding took place around 1429.
While still a young man, Hunyadi entered the retinue of King Sigismund. He accompanied Sigismund to Italy in 1431 and upon Sigismund&#x27;s order he joined the army of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan. Bonfini says that Hunyadi &quot;served two years&quot; in the Duke&#x27;s army. Modern scholarsfor instance, Cartledge, Engel, Mureşanu and Tekesay that Hunyadi familiarized himself with the principles of contemporary military art, including the employment of mercenaries, in Milan.

Hunyadi again joined the entourage of Sigismund, who had in the meantime been crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome, at the very end of 1433. He served the monarch as a &quot;court knight&quot;. He loaned 1,200 gold florins to the Emperor in January 1434. In exchange, Sigismund mortgaged Papia market town in Csanád Countyand half of the royal incomes from a nearby ferry on the Maros River to Hunyadi and his younger brother. The royal charter of the transaction mentions Hunyadi as John the Vlach (Romanian). In short, Sigismund granted Hunyadi further domains, including Békésszentandrás, and Hódmezővásárhely, each incorporating about 10 villages.

Antonio Bonfini writes of Hunyadi&#x27;s service in the retinue of one &quot;Francis Csanádi&quot; who &quot;became so fond of him that treated him as if he were his own son&quot;. Historian Engel identifies Francis Csanádi with Franko Talovac, Croatian nobleman and Ban of Severin, who was also &quot;Ispán&quot; of Csanád County around 1432. Engel says that Hunyadi served in the Ban&#x27;s retinue for at least one and a half years from around October 1434. A Vlach district of the Banate of Severin was mortgaged to Hunyadi in this period.

Sigismund, who entered Prague in the summer of 1436, hired Hunyadi and his 50 lancers for three months in October 1437 for 1,250 gold florins, implying that Hunyadi had accompanied him to Bohemia. Hunyadi seems to have studied the Hussites&#x27; tactics on this occasion, because he later applied its featuring elements, including the use of wagons as a mobile fortress. On 9 December 1437 Sigismund died; his son-in-law, Albert was elected King of Hungary in nine days. According to historians Teke and Engel, Hunyadi soon returned to the southern frontiers of the kingdom which had been subject to Ottoman raids. In contrast with them, Mureşanu says that Hunyadi served King Albert in Bohemia for at least a year, until the end of 1438.

=== First battles with the Ottomans (1438–1442) ===

The Ottomans had occupied the larger part of Serbia by the end of 1438. In the same year, Ottoman troopssupported by Vlad II Dracul, Prince of Wallachiamade an incursion into Transylvania, plundering Hermannstadt/Nagyszeben, Gyulafehérvár (present-day Alba Iulia, Romania) and other towns. After the Ottomans laid siege to Smederevo, the last important Serbian stronghold in June 1439, Đurađ Branković, Despot of Serbia fled to Hungary to seek military assistance.

King Albert proclaimed the general insurrection of the nobility against the Ottomans, but few armed noblemen assembled in the region of Titel and were ready to fight. A notable exception was Hunyadi, who made raids against the besiegers and defeated them in smaller skirmishes, which contributed to the rise of his fame. The Ottomans captured Smederevo in August. King Albert appointed the Hunyadi brothers Bans of Severin, elevating them to the rank of &quot;true barons of the realm&quot;. He also mortgaged a Vlach district in Temes County to them.

King Albert died of dysentery on 27 October 1439. His widow, ElisabethEmperor Sigismund&#x27;s daughtergave birth to a posthumus son, Ladislaus. The Estates of the realm offered the crown to Vladislaus, King of Poland, but Elizabeth had his infant son crowned king on 15 May 1440. However, Vladislaus accepted the Estates&#x27; offer and was also crowned king on 17 July. During the ensuing civil war between the two kings&#x27; partisans, Hunyadi supported Vladislaus. Hunyadi fought against the Ottomans in Wallachia, for which King Vladislaus granted him five domains in the vicinity of his family estates on 9 August 1440.

Hunyadi, together with Nicholas of Ilok, annihilated the troops of Vladislaus&#x27; opponents at Bátaszék at the very beginning of 1441. Their victory effectively put an end to the civil war. The grateful King appointed Hunyadi and his comrade joint Voivodes of Transylvania and Counts of the Székelys in February. In short, the King also nominated them &quot;Ispáns&quot; of Temes County and conferred upon them the command of Belgrade and all other castles along the Danube.

Since Nicholas of Ilok spent most of his time in the royal court, in practice Hunyadi administered Transylvania and the southern borderlands alone. Soon after his appointment, Hunyadi visited Transylvania where the child Ladislaus V&#x27;s partisans had maintained a strong position. After Hunyadi pacified Transylvania, the regions under his administration remained undisturbed by internal conflicts, enabling Hunyadi to concentrate on the defence of the borders. By effectively defending the interests of local landowners at the royal court, Hunyadi strengthened his position in the provinces under his administration. For instance, he obtained land grants and privileges for local noblemen from the King.

Hunyadi set about repairing the walls of Belgrade, which had been damaged during an Ottoman attack. In retaliation for Ottoman raids in the region of the river Sava, he made an incursion into Ottoman territory in the summer or autumn of 1441. He scored a pitched battle victory over Ishak Bey, the commander of Smederovo.

Early the next year, Bey Mezid invaded Transylvania with a force of 17,000 soldiers. Hunyadi was taken by surprise and lost the first battle near Marosszentimre (Sântimbru, Romania). Bey Mezid lay siege to Hermannstadt, but the united forces of Hunyadi and Újlaki, who had in the meantime arrived in Transylvania, forced the Ottomans to lift the siege. The Ottoman forces were annihilated at Gyulafehérvár on 22 March.

Pope Eugenius IV, who had been an enthusiastic propagator of a new crusade against the Ottomans, sent his legate, Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini to Hungary. The Cardinal arrived in May 1442 tasked with mediating a peace treaty between King Vladislaus and Dowager Queen Elisabeth. The Ottoman Sultan, Murad II dispatched Şihabeddin Pashathe governor of Rumeliato invade Transylvania with a force of 70,000. The Pasha stated that the mere sight of his turban would force his enemies to run far away. Although Hunyadi could only muster a force of 15,000 men, he inflicted a crushing defeat on the Ottomans at the Ialomița River in September. John Hunyadi and his 15,000 men defeated the 80,000-strong army of Begler Bey Sehabeddin at Zajkány (today&#x27;s Zeicani), near the Iron Gate of the Danube river in 1442. Hunyadi placed Basarab II on the princely throne of Wallachia, but Basarab&#x27;s opponent Vlad Dracul returned and forced Basarab to flee in early 1443.

Hunyadi&#x27;s victories in 1441 and 1442 made him a prominent enemy of the Ottomans and renowned throughout Christendom. He established a vigorous offensive posture in his battles, which enabled him to counteract the numerical superiority of the Ottomans through decisive maneuver. He employed mercenaries (many of them recently disbanded Czech Hussite troops), increasing the professionalism in his ranks and supplementing the numerous irregulars mustered from local peasantry, whom he had no reservations about employing in the field.

==General and politician==
===The &quot;Long Campaign&quot; (1442–1444)===

In April 1443 King Vladislaus and his barons decided to mount a major campaign against the Ottoman Empire. With the mediation of Cardinal Cesarini, Vladislaus reached a truce with Frederick III of Germany, who had been the guardian of the child Ladislaus V. The armistice guaranteed that Frederick III would not attack Hungary in the subsequent twelve months.

Spending around 32,000 gold florins from his own treasury, Hunyadi hired more than 10,000 mercenaries. The King also mustered troops, and reinforcements arrived from Poland and Moldavia. The King and Hunyadi departed for the campaign at the head of an army of 25–27,000 men in the autumn of 1443. In theory, Vladislaus commanded the army, but the true leader of the campaign was Hunyadi. Despot Đurađ Branković joined them with a force of 8,000 men.

Hunyadi commanded the vanguards and routed four smaller Ottoman forces, hindering their unification. He captured Kruševac, Niš and Sofia. However, the Hungarian troops could not break through the passes of the Balkan Mountains towards Edirne. Cold weather and the lack of supplies forced the Christian troops to stop the campaign at Zlatitsa. After being victorious in the Battle of Kunovica, they returned to Belgrade in January and Buda in February 1444.

===Battle of Varna and its aftermath (1444–1446)===
Although no major Ottoman forces had been defeated, Hunyadi&#x27;s &quot;long campaign&quot; stirred enthusiasm throughout Christian Europe. Pope Eugenius, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy and other European powers demanded a new crusade, promising financial or military support. The formation of a &quot;party&quot;a group of noblemen and clericsunder Hunyadi&#x27;s leadership can be dated to this period. Their main purpose was the defence of Hungary against the Ottomans. According to a letter of Đurađ Branković, Hunyadi spent more than 63,000 gold florins to hire mercenaries in the first half of the year. An eminent representative of Renaissance humanism in Hungary, John Vitéz became Hunyadi&#x27;s close friend around that time.

The advance of Christian forces in Ottoman territory also encouraged the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula to revolt in the peripheries of the Ottoman Empire. For instance, Skanderbeg, an Albanian noble, expelled the Ottomans from Krujë and all other fortresses once held by his family. Sultan Murad II, whose main concern was a rebellion by the Karamanids in Anatolia, offered generous terms of peace to King Vladislaus. He even promised to withdraw the Ottoman garrisons from Serbia, thus restoring its semi-autonomous status under Despot Đurađ Branković. He also offered a truce for ten years. The Hungarian envoys accepted the Sultan&#x27;s offer in Edirne on 12 June 1444.

Đurađ Branković, who was grateful for the restoration of his realm, donated his estates at Világos (present-day Șiria, Romania) in Zaránd County to Hunyadi on 3 July. Hunyadi proposed King Vladislaus to confirm the advantageous treaty, but Cardinal Cesarini urged the monarch to continue the crusade. On 4 August Vladislaus took a solemn oath of launching a campaign against the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year even if a peace treaty were concluded. According to Johannes de Thurocz, the King appointed Hunyadi to sign the peace treaty on 15 August. In a week, Đurađ Branković mortgaged his extensive domains in the Kingdom of Hungaryincluding Debrecen, Munkács (present-day Mukacheve, Ukraine), and Nagybánya (present-day Baia Mare, Romania)to Hunyadi.

King Vladislaus, whom Cardinal Cesarini urged to keep his oath, decided to invade the Ottoman Empire in autumn. Upon the Cardinal&#x27;s proposal, he offered Hunyadi the crown of Bulgaria.
The crusaders departed from Hungary on 22 September. They planned to advance towards the Black Sea across the Balkan Mountains. They expected that the Venetian fleet would hinder Sultan Murad from transferring Ottoman forces from Anatolia to the Balkans, but the Genoese transported the Sultan&#x27;s army across the Dardanelles.
The two armies clashed near Varna on 10 November.

Although outnumbered by two to one, the crusaders initially ruled the battlefield against the Ottomans. However, the young King Vladislaus launched a premature attack against the janissaries and was killed. Taking advantage of the crusaders&#x27; panic, the Ottomans annihilated their army. Hunyadi narrowly escaped from the battlefield, but was captured and imprisoned by Wallachian soldiers. However, Vlad Dracul set him free before long.

At the next Diet of Hungary, which assembled in April 1445, the Estates decided that they would unanimously acknowledge the child Ladislaus V&#x27;s rule if King Vladislaus, whose fate was still uncertain, had not arrived in Hungary by the end of May. The Estates also elected seven &quot;Captains in Chief&quot;, including Hunyadi, each being responsible for the restoration of internal order in the territory allotted to them. Hunyadi was assigned to administer the lands east of the river Tisza. Here he possessed at least six castles and owned lands in about ten counties, which made him the most powerful baron in the region under his rule.

Hunyadi was planning to organize a new crusade against the Ottoman Empire. For this purpose, he barraged the Pope and other Western monarchs with letters in 1445. In September he had a meeting, at Nicopolis, with Waleran de Wavrin (nephew of the chronicler Jean de Wavrin), the captain of eight Burgundian galleys, and Vlad Dracul of Wallachia, who had seized small fortresses along the Lower Danube from the Ottomans. However, he did not risk a clash with the Ottoman garrisons stationed on the south bank of the river, and returned to Hungary before winter. Vlad Dracul soon concluded a peace treaty with the Ottomans.

===Governorship (1446–1453)===
The Estates of the realm proclaimed Hunyadi regent, bestowing the title &quot;governor&quot; upon him on 6 June 1446. His election was primarily promoted by the lesser nobility, but Hunyadi had by that time become one of the richest barons of the kingdom. His domains covered an area exceeding . Hunyadi was one of the few contemporaneous barons who spent a significant part of their revenues to finance the wars against the Ottomans, thus bearing a large share of the cost of fighting for many years.

As governor, Hunyadi was authorized to exercise most royal prerogatives for the period of King Ladislaus V&#x27;s minority. For instance, he could make land grants, but only up to the size of 32 peasant holdings. Hunyadi attempted to pacify the border regions. Soon after his election, he launched an unsuccessful campaign against Ulrich II, Count of Celje. Count Ulrich administered Slavonia with the title ban (which he had arbitrarily adopted) and refused to renounce of it in favor of Hunyadi&#x27;s appointee. Hunyadi could not force him to submit.

Hunyadi persuaded John Jiskra of Brandýsa Czech commander who controlled the northern regions (in present-day Slovakia)to sign an armistice for three years on 13 September. However, Jiskra did not keep the truce, and armed conflicts continued. In November Hunyadi proceeded against Frederick III of Germany, who had refused to release Ladislaus V and seized Kőszeg, Sopron and other towns along the western border. Hunyadi&#x27;s troops plundered Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, but no decisive battle was fought. A truce with Frederick III was signed on 1 June 1447. Although Frederick renounced of Győr, his position as the minor King&#x27;s guardian was confirmed. The Estates of the realm were disappointed and the Diet elected Ladislaus Garaia leader of Hunyadi&#x27;s opponentsPalatine in September 1447.

Hunyadi accelerated his negotiations, which had been commenced in the previous year, with Alfonso the Magnanimous, King of Aragon and Naples. He even offered the crown to Alfonso in exchange for the King&#x27;s participation in an anti-Ottoman crusade and the confirmation of his position as governor. However, King Alfonso refrained from signing an agreement.

Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and dethroned Vlad Dracul in December 1447. According to the contemporaneous Polish chronicler Jan Długosz, Hunyadi had &quot;the very man he promised to make voivode&quot; blinded, and planned &quot;to appropriate&quot; Wallachia for himself. Hunyadi styled himself &quot;voivode of the Transalpine land&quot; and referred to the Wallachian town, Târgoviște as &quot;our fortress&quot; in a letter of 4 December. It is without doubt that Hunyadi installed a new voivode in Wallachia, but modern historians debate whether the new voivode was Vladislav II (to whom Hunyadi referred as his relative in a letter) or Dan (who seems to have been a son of Basarab II). In February 1448 Hunyadi sent an army to Moldavia to support the pretender Peter in seizing the throne. In exchange, Peter acknowledged Hunyadi&#x27;s suzerainty and contributed to the installation of a Hungarian garrison in the fort of Chilia Veche on the Lower Danube.

Hunyadi made a new attempt to expel Count Ulrich of Celje from Slavonia, but could not defeat him. In June Hunyadi and the Count reached an agreement, which confirmed Count Ulrich&#x27;s position of Ban in Slavonia. In short time Hunyadi sent his envoys to the two most prominent Albanian leadersScanderbeg and his father-in-law, Gjergj Arianitito seek their assistance against the Ottomans. Pope Eugenius suggested that the anti-Ottoman campaign should be postponed. However, Hunyadi stated, in a letter dated 8 September 1448, that he &quot;have had enough of our men enslaved, our women raped, wagons loaded with the severed heads of our people&quot; and expressed his determination to expel &quot;the enemy from Europe&quot;. In the same letter, he explained his military strategy to the Pope, stating that &quot;[p]ower is always greater when used in attack rather than in defence&quot;.

Hunyadi departed for the new campaign at the head of an army of 16,000 soldiers in September 1448. About 8,000 soldiers from Wallachia also joined his campaign. For Đurađ Branković refused to assist the crusaders, Hunyadi treated him as the Ottoman&#x27;s ally and his army marched through Serbia plundering the countryside. In order to prevent the unification of the armies of Hunyadi and Skanderbeg, Sultan Murad II joined battle with Hunyadi on Kosovo Polje on 17 October. The battle, which lasted for three days, ended with the crusaders&#x27; catastrophic defeat. Around 17,000 Hungarian and Wallachian soldiers were killed or captured and Hunyadi could hardly escape from the battlefield. On his way home, Hunyadi was captured by Đurađ Branković who kept him prisoner in the fort of Smederevo. The Despot was initially contemplating to surrender Hunyadi to the Ottomans. However, the Hungarian barons and prelates who assembled at Szeged persuaded him to make peace with Hunyadi. According to the treaty, Hunyadi was obliged to pay a ransom of 100,000 gold florins and to return all the domains that he had acquired from Đurađ Branković. Hunyadi&#x27;s oldest son, Ladislaus was sent to the Despot as a hostage. Hunyadi was released, and he returned to Hungary in late December 1448.

His defeat and his humiliating treaty with the Despot weakened Hunyadi&#x27;s position. The prelates and the barons confirmed the treaty and assigned Branković to negotiate with the Ottomans, and Hunyadi resigned from the office of Voivode of Transylvania. He invaded the lands controlled by John Jiskra and his Czech mercenaries in the autumn of 1449, but could not defeat them. On the other hand, the rulers of two neighboring countriesStjepan Tomaš, King of Bosnia, and Bogdan II, Voivode of Moldaviaconcluded a treaty with Hunyadi, promising that they would remain loyal to him. In early 1450 Hunyadi and Jiskra signed a peace treaty in Mezőkövesd, acknowledging that many prosperous towns in Upper Hungaryincluding Pressburg/Pozsony (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) and Kassa (present-day Košice, Slovakia)remained under Jiskra&#x27;s rule.

Upon Hunyadi&#x27;s demand, the Diet of March 1450 ordered the confiscation of Branković&#x27;s estates in the Kingdom of Hungary. Hunyadi and his troops departed for Serbia, forcing Branković to release his son. Hunyadi, Ladislaus Garai and Nicholas Újlaki concluded a treaty on 17 July 1450, promising each other assistance to preserve their offices in case King Ladislaus V returned to Hungary. In October Hunyadi made peace with Frederick III of Germany, which confirmed the German monarch&#x27;s position as guardian of Ladislaus V for further eight years. With the mediation of Újlaki and other barons, Hunyadi also concluded a peace treaty with Branković in August 1451, which authorized Hunyadi to redeem the debated domains for 155,000 gold florins. Hunyadi launched a military expedition against Jiskra, but the Czech commander routed the Hungarian troops near Losonc (present-day Lučenec, Slovakia) on 7 September. With the mediation of Branković, Hungary and the Ottoman Empire signed a three-year truce on 20 November.

The Austrian noblemen rose up in open rebellion against Frederick III of Germany, who governed the duchy in the name of Ladislaus the Posthumus at the turn of 1451 and 1452. The leader of the rebellion, Ulrich Eizinger sought the assistance of the Estates of Ladislaus&#x27;s two other realms, Bohemia and Hungary. The Diet of Hungary, which assembled in Pressburg/Pozsony in February 1452, sent a delegation to Vienna. On 5 March the Austrian and Hungarian Estates jointly requested Frederick III to renounce the guardianship of their young sovereign. Frederick, who had been crowned Holy Roman Emperor, initially refused to satisfy their demand. Hunyadi convoked a Diet to discuss the situation, but before the Diet made any decision the united troops of the Austrian and Bohemian Estates forced the Emperor to hand over the young monarch to Count Ulrich of Celje on 4 September. In the meantime, Hunyadi had met Jiskra in Körmöcbánya (present-day Kremnica, Slovakia) where they concluded a treaty on 24 August. According to the treaty, Jiskra retained Léva (present-day Levica, Slovakia) and his right to collect the &quot;thirtieth&quot;a custom dutyat Késmárk (present-day Kežmarok, Slovakia) and Ólubló (present-day Stará Ľubovňa, Slovakia). In September Hunyadi sent envoys to Constantinople and promised military assistance to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI. In exchange, he demanded two Byzantine forts on the Black Sea, Silivri and Misivri, but the Emperor refused.

Hunyadi convoked a Diet to Buda, but the barons and the prelates preferred to visit Ladislaus V in Vienna in November. At the Diet of Vienna, Hunyadi renounced the regency, but the King appointed him &quot;captain general of the kingdom&quot; on 30 January 1453. The King even authorized Hunyadi to keep the royal castles and royal revenues that he possessed at that time. Hunyadi also received Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania)a district of the Transylvanian Saxonswith the title &quot;perpetual count&quot; from Ladislaus V, which was the first grant of a hereditary title in the Kingdom of Hungary.

===Conflicts and reconciliations (1453–1455)===

In a letter of 28 April 1453, Aeneas Silvius Piccolominithe future Pope Pius IIstated that King Ladislaus V&#x27;s realms were administered by &quot;three men&quot;: Hungary by Hunyadi, Bohemia by George of Poděbrady, and Austria by Ulrich of Celje. However, Hunyadi&#x27;s position gradually weakened, because even many of his former allies considered his acts to retain his power with suspicion. The citizens of Beszterce forced him to issue a charter confirming their traditional liberties on 22 July. Hunyadi&#x27;s longtime friend, Nicholas Újlaki made a formal alliance with Palatine Ladislaus Garai and Judge royal Ladislaus Pálóci, declaring their intention to restore royal authority in September.

Hunyadi accompanied the young King to Prague and concluded a treaty with Ulrich Eizinger (who had expelled Ulrich of Celje from Austria) and George of Poděbrady at the end of the year. Having returned to Hungary, Hunyadi convoked, in the name of the King but without his authorization, a Diet in order to make preparations for a war on the Ottomans who had in May 1453 captured Constantinople. The Diet ordered the mobilization of the armed forces and Hunyadi&#x27;s position of supreme commander was confirmed for a year, but many of the decisions was never carried out. For instance, the Diet obliged all landowners to equip four cavalrymen and two infantrymen for every hundred peasant households on their domains, but this law was never applied in practise.

Ladislaus V convoked a new Diet which assembled in March or April. At the Diet, his envoysthree Austrian noblemenannounced that the King was planning to administer royal revenues through officials elected by the Diet and to set up two councils (also with members elected by the Estates) in order to assist him in governing the country. However, the Diet refused to ratify most of the royal proposals, only the establishment of a royal council consisting of six prelates, six barons and six noblemen was accepted. Hunyadi, who was well aware that the King attempted to limit his authority, demanded an explanation, but the King denied that he had knowledge of his representatives&#x27; act. On the other hand, Jiskra returned to Hungary upon Ladislaus V&#x27;s request and the King entrusted him with the administration of the mining towns. In response, Hunyadi persuaded Ulrich of Celje to cede him a number of royal fortresses (and the lands pertaining to them) which had been mortgaged in Trencsén County.

The Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II invaded Serbia in May 1454 and laid siege to Smederevo, thus violating the truce of November 1451 between his empire and Hungary. Hunyadi decided to intervene and started to assemble his armies at Belgrade, forcing the Sultan to lift the siege and leave Serbia in August. However, an Ottoman force of 32,000 strong continued to pillage Serbia up until Hunyadi routed them at Kruševac on 29 September. He made a raid against the Ottoman Empire and destroyed Vidin before returning to Belgrade.

Emperor Frederick III convoked the Imperial Diet to Wiener Neustadt to discuss the possibilities of a new crusade against the Ottomans. At the conference, where the envoys of the Hungarian, Polish, Aragonese and Burgundian monarchs were also present, no final decisions were made, because the Emperor refrained from a sudden attack against the Ottomans. According to Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, the Emperor hindered Hunyadi from participating at the meeting. In contrast with the Emperor, the new Pope, Callixtus III was a fierce supporter of the crusade.

King Ladislaus V visited Buda in February 1456. Ulrich of Celje, who accompanied the King to Buda, confirmed his former alliance with Ladislaus Garai and Nicholaus Újlaki. The three barons turned against Hunyadi and accused him of abusing his authority. A new Ottoman invasion against Serbia promoted a new reconciliation between Hunyadi and his opponents, and Hunyadi resigned the administration of part of the royal revenues and three royal fortresses, including Buda. On the other hand, Hunyadi, Garai and Újlaki made an agreement that they would refrain the King from employing foreigners in the royal administration in June 1455. Hunyadi and Count Ulrich were also reconciled in next month, when Hunyadi&#x27;s younger son, Matthias and the Count&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth were engaged.

===Belgrade victory and death (1455–1456)===
Envoys from Ragusa (Dubrovnik, Croatia) were the first to have informed the Hungarian leaders of the preparations that Mehmed II had made for an invasion against Hungary. In a letter addressed to Hunyadi, whom he styled as &quot;the Maccabeus of our time&quot;, the papal legate, Cardinal Juan Carvajal made it clear that there was not much chance of foreign assistance against the Ottomans. With the Ottomans&#x27; support, Vladislav II of Wallachia even plundered the southern parts of Transylvania in late 1455.

John of Capistrano, a Franciscan friar and papal inquisitor, started to preach an anti-Ottoman crusade in Hungary in February 1456. The Diet ordered the mobilization of the armed forces in April, but most barons failed to obey and continued to war against their local adversaries, including the Hussites in Upper Hungary. Before departing from Transylvania against the Ottomans, Hunyadi had to face a rebellion by the Vlachs in Fogaras County. He also supported Vlad Draculaa son of the late Vlad Draculto seize the Wallachian throne from Vladislav II.

King Ladislaus V left Hungary for Vienna in May. Hunyadi hired 5,000 Hungarian, Czech and Polish mercenaries and sent them to Belgrade, which was the key fortress of the defense of Hungary&#x27;s southern frontiers. The Ottoman forces marched through Serbia and approached Nándorfehérvár (modern-day Belgrade) in June. A crusade made up mostly of peasants from the nearby counties, who had been roused by John of Capistrano&#x27;s fiery oratory, also started to assemble at the fortress in the first days of July. The Ottoman siege of Belgrade, which was personally commanded by Sultan Mehmed II, began with the bombardment of the walls on 4 July.

Hunyadi proceeded to form a relief army, and assembled a fleet of 200 ships on the Danube. The flotilla assembled by Hunyadi destroyed the Ottoman fleet on 14 July. This triumph prevented the Ottomans from completing the blockade, enabling Hunyadi and his troops to enter the fortress. The Ottomans started a general assault on 21 July. With the assistance of crusaders who were continuously arriving to the fortress, Hunyadi repulsed the fierce attacks by the Ottomans and broke into their camp on 22 July. Although wounded during the fights, Sultan Mehmed II, decided to resist, but a riot in his camp forced him to lift the siege and retreat from Belgrade during the night.

The crusaders&#x27; victory over the Sultan who had conquered Constantinople generated enthusiasm throughout Europe. Processions to celebrate Hunyadi&#x27;s triumph were made in Venice and Oxford. However, in the crusaders&#x27; camp unrest was growing, because the peasants denied that the barons had played any role in the victory. In order to avoid an open rebellion, Hunyadi and Capistrano disbanded the crusaders&#x27; army.

Meanwhile, a plague had broken out and killed many people in the crusaders&#x27; camp. Hunyadi was also taken ill and died near Zimony (present-day Zemun, Serbia) on 11 August. He was buried in the Roman Catholic St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia).

==Family==
In 1432, Hunyadi married Erzsébet Szilágyi (c. 1410–1483), a Hungarian noblewoman. John Hunyadi had two children, Ladislaus and Matthias Corvinus. The former was executed on the order of King Ladislaus V for the murder of Ulrich II of Celje, a relative of the king. The latter was elected king on 20 January 1458, Matthias after Ladislaus V&#x27;s death. It was the first time in the history of the Kingdom of Hungary that a member of the nobility, without dynastic ancestry and relationship, mounted the royal throne.

==Legacy==
===The noon bell===
Pope Callixtus III ordered the bells of every European church to be rung every day at noon, as a call for believers to pray for the Christian defenders of the city of Belgrade. The practice of noon bell is traditionally attributed to the international commemoration of the Belgrade victory and to the order of Pope Callixtus III.
The custom still exists even among Protestant and Orthodox congregations. In the history of Oxford University, the victory was welcomed with a peal of bells and great celebrations in England too. Hunyadi sent a special courier (among others), Erasmus Fullar, to Oxford with the news of the victory.

===The national hero===

Along with his son Matthias Corvinus, Hunyadi is considered a Hungarian national hero and praised as its defender against the Ottoman threat.

Romanian historiography adopted Hunyadi and gives him a place of importance in the history of Romania too. However, Romanian national consciousness did not embrace him to the extent that Hungarian national conscience did. John Hunyadi, a Hungarian hero, was subordinated to the ideology of National Communism in the era of Ceaușescu and transmuted into a hero of Romania.

Pope Pius II writes that &quot;Hunyadi did not increase so much the glory of the Hungarians, but especially the glory of the Romanians among whom he was born.&quot;

The French writer and diplomat Philippe de Commines described Hunyadi as &quot;a very valiant gentleman, called the White Knight of Wallachia, a person of great honour and prudence, who for a long time had governed the kingdom of Hungary, and had gained several battles over the Turks&quot;.

Pietro Ranzano wrote in his work &quot;Annales omnium temporum&quot; (1490–1492) that John Hunyadi was commonly called &quot;Ianco&quot;&#x27; (&quot;„Ioanne Huniate, Ianco vulgo cognominator&quot;). In chronicles written by Byzantine Greek authors (such as George Sphrantzes and Laonikos Chalkokondyles) he is called „Ianco/Iango&quot;, „Iancou/Iangou&quot;, „Iancos/Iangos&quot;, „Iancoula/Iangoula&quot;, „Gianco/Giango&quot; and „Ghiangou&quot;
Byzantine literature treated Hunyadi as a saint:


Hunyadi was &quot;recognised as being Hungarian...&quot; and &quot;frequently called Ugrin Janko, &#x27;Janko the Hungarian&#x27;&quot; in the Serbian and Croatian societies of the 15th century, while another bugarštica makes him of Serbian origin. According to a &quot;bugarštica&quot; (a Serbian popular poem), he was the son of Despot Stefan Lazarević and Stefan&#x27;s alleged wife, a girl from Hermannstadt/Nagyszeben (present-day Sibiu, Romania). Actually, the Despot did not father any children. He is also portrayed as an ardent supporter of the Catholicization of Orthodox peoples.

In Bulgarian folklore, the memory of Hunyadi was preserved in the epic song hero character of &quot;Yankul(a) Voivoda&quot;, along with &quot;Sekula Detentse&quot;, a fictitious hero perhaps inspired by Hunyadi&#x27;s nephew, Thomas Székely.

He was subsidiary to Roger de Flor as the role model for the fictional character of Tirant lo Blanc, the epic romance written by Joanot Martorell, published in Valencia in 1490. They both shared, for instance, the device of a raven on their shield.

Nicolaus Olahus was the nephew of John Hunyadi.

In 1515, the English printer Wynkyn de Worde published a long metrical romance called &#x27;Capystranus&#x27;, a graphic account of the defeat of the Turks.

In 1791, Hannah Brand produced a new play called &#x27;Huniades or The Siege of Belgrade&#x27;, which played to a packed house in the King&#x27;s Theatre, Norwich.

Iancu de Hunedoara National College in Hunedoara, Romania is named after him.

Rise of the Raven: A historical TV series about John Hunyadi that debuted in 2024. The series was made with over 600 international actors, and the production is unique in that the actors speak in their native languages, adding to its historical authenticity. In Rise of the Raven, John Hunyadi devotes his life to defending Europe against the Ottoman invasion. Amid political intrigue and betrayal, and conspiracies between noble families from Hungary, Austria, Italy, Poland, Serbia, his key allies are his wife Elizabeth, who fights alongside him, and Mara, his first love, who becomes Sultan Murad’s concubine. As the Ottoman Empire mobilizes an enormous army to conquer Hungary, Hunyadi leads his smaller but formidable forces into battle, sealing a hard-fought victory at the Siege of Belgrade.

<doc id="285015" wikidata="Q4706316" url="?curid=285015" title="Alan Campbell (pastor)">
<text>Joseph Alan Johnston Campbell (7 August 1949 – 11 June 2017) was a Northern Irish Pentecostal pastor and Orangeman from Belfast. He founded and served as pastor and director of the Restored Open Bible Ministries in Northern Ireland. He was an author on Bible studies, a lecturer in the British Israelism movement and an advocate of white supremacy. Strongly opposed to Catholicism, Campbell published anti-Catholic literature and argued that the white Celto Anglo Saxon peoples of the world represent the lost tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel. He was known in Historicist circles due to his denial of the Westminster Confession of Faith, while Fundamentalist Protestants rejected his teachings as not being biblical.

Although not a leading figure, Campbell was unapologetically loyalist and racist in his views. He was connected to activities by loyalists, including terrorism, from the early days of the Troubles. Although not named, Campbell was often referred to as &quot;The Pastor&quot;. He had a strong association with prominent paedophiles John McKeague and William McGrath. Later he was friends with convicted loyalist paramilitaries Clifford Peeples, in particular, and Kenny McClinton. These four associates of Campbell&#x27;s have been named as British agents. Loyalist politician and UVF member George Seawright was also a close friend. With Peeples and McClinton, Campbell worked to undermine the fledgling Northern Ireland peace process that led to the Good Friday Agreement and power-sharing in Northern Ireland by smearing the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries, namely the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and Ulster Democratic Party (UDP). Campbell was instrumental in Billy Wright establishing the LVF, after his expulsion from the UVF for breaking the loyalist ceasefire. Former loyalist Roy Garland considered Campbell an expert in stirring up trouble via letter-writing and making bogus phone calls.

In his early 20s, Campbell sexually assaulted a boy and was put on trial before being acquitted in suspicious circumstances. Three years later he became the chief suspect in the paedophile murder of Belfast boy Brian McDermott in September 1973 but left Belfast very soon afterwards to start a degree course in London. One journalist has stated: &quot;It’s important the public know the full story about this evil man&quot;, while a book refers to Campbell as a &quot;child rapist&quot;.

==Early life==
Joseph Alan Johnston Campbell was born in on 7 August 1949 to parents Joseph (a stevedore) and May into a staunchly Presbyterian, well-to-do home in Wheatfield Crescent off the upper Crumlin Road, a Protestant district of North Belfast where Roman Catholic families also lived. He spent much of his life in the north of the city. His grandmother was a firm adherent of the doctrine of British Israelism, and thus he was exposed to this teaching from an early age. Despite his upbringing, he did not convert to Christianity until 19 September 1965, in the Ravenhill Free Presbyterian Church, after listening to a sermon by Rev. Ian Paisley. He had first listened to Paisley in the latter&#x27;s tiny gospel hall some years before. In the early 1970s, Campbell disavowed his affiliation to the Free Presbyterian faith for what he considered Paisley&#x27;s weak opposition to Irish nationalism.

Because of his &quot;Kingdom Identity&quot; views (which hold that Israel, not the church, is the bride of Christ, in contradiction to the teachings of the Westminster Confession of Faith) and his acceptance of Pentecostal beliefs, Campbell left the Free Presbyterian Church and no longer promoted Paisley.

He left Belfast in September 1973 to study History at the University of London, where he graduated with a 2.2 degree in 1976. He subsequently received a certificate in Biblical Studies from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

Although Campbell denied to fellow loyalist Roy Garland that he was homosexual, he claimed in a police interview that he was a celibate homosexual. Former unionist councillor John Carson had heard rumours about Campbell&#x27;s homosexuality. Campbell&#x27;s name came up in statements made by others about alleged unwanted homosexual advances towards young boys. In the late 1960s, he took a girlfriend as cover for his homosexuality. She later admitted that the relationship had never gone anywhere.

==Religious and racial beliefs==
===Preaching and Ulster===
Campbell began preaching in May 1974 and delivered his first sermon on Bible prophecy on 24 September 1978. He was officially ordained to the ministry by Dr Francis Thomas on 18 July 1988. He was the author of a number of Bible study books and lectured throughout the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Australia.

His ministry centred in Ulster and many of his messages dealt with the political situation there. Amongst his best-known publications was &quot;Five Things Every Ulster Protestant Needs To Know&quot;, published by Open-Bible Ministries in 1997. In 1989, when he led Covenant People&#x27;s Fellowship, Campbell opined that the people of Ulster possessed their own identity &quot;separate from the so-called Irish identity that everybody&#x27;s trying to foist upon us against our will&quot;, but that identity and heredity had become neither Irish nor English. Campbell also had contact with the Christian Assemblies International.

===Lost tribes of Israel===
Campbell, a &quot;British Israelite&quot;, believed that the people of Ulster form part of the lost tribes of Israel taken into exile by the Assyrians. Further, his sermons on this subject taught his listeners that the Protestant people of Ulster and the white race in South Africa represent Israel&#x27;s lost tribes. He argued that the hand of the Lord had seen a Calvinist race, descended from the people of Israel, settle in each place well over 500 years previously and form an ethnic nation. God&#x27;s plan, he contended, is that each race has a special duty to convert non-believers and remain immovable in defence of the truth of the gospel.

Campbell, an outspoken Ulster-Israelite, preached about the movement of lost tribes of Israel through Western Europe. He considered himself amongst the third-generation of followers of the British-Israeli cause he espoused. In 1988, he observed that Ulster people had felt pressurised into feeling shame for their patriotic and loyalist views. British-Israelism, by contrast, rejects such teaching: &quot;Britain is part of God&#x27;s vineyard, Ulster is our own Promised Land, peopled by the very seed of Israel planted here as a light in darkest Ireland, and we must occupy until Jesus comes&quot;.

He was also a prominent figure in the Association of Covenant People, which teaches that Anglo-Celto-Saxon peoples can trace their lineage back to the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Reformed Evangelical Protestants decried Campbell&#x27;s views on British Israel as being contrary to scripture.

In the late 1990s, the British Israel movement forbade Campbell from addressing any of its gatherings.

===Anti-Catholicism===
Campbell held fiercely anti-Catholic views and mentored &quot;anti-Catholic sectarian bigot&quot; Clifford Peoples. Campbell once referred to Catholics as worshipping a &quot;wafer God&quot; and used his website to disseminate such sentiments; he also authored a number of anti-Catholic pamphlets, including &quot;Rome Watch&quot;. Campbell once linked a protest to the ancient conflict between Protestant beliefs and the Beast of Rome. Critics of Campbell noted that he fomented opposition to Catholics. In August 2002, a unionist Catholic journalist noted that Campbell had referred to him as &quot;that Romanist who writes for the Belfast Telegraph&quot;.

Campbell&#x27;s website also recounted tales of Catholic clergy in various countries making the news for involvement in crimes of a sexual nature. The Church of Rome, he argued, was carrying out a jihad against the Protestant religion. He directed his ire towards Tony Blair on account of the Prime Minister&#x27;s spouse being a Catholic. One commentator observed that Campbell had failed to draw attention to activities of that nature undertaken by the likes of McGrath or McKeague.

A flavour of Campbell&#x27;s views can be seen in a sermon delivered in October 1985 at the Cregagh Pentecostal Fellowship in which he attacked all major tenets of the Catholic faith. In Campbell&#x27;s opinion, there is no single Antichrist but, instead, it is seen in the entire succession of Bishops of Rome. In the struggle against the Antichrist, the soul of Ulster would be a key battleground.

Campbell likened the Harryville church protest to the historical struggle between the true believers of God&#x27;s word and the idolatry of Catholicism. This was &quot;a battle to the finish&quot; to deny popery a devastating victory over Protestantism. Open Bible Ministries, led by &quot;notorious anti-Catholic figure Campbell&quot;, was Ulster&#x27;s primary British Israeli movement. Its theological and political focus was stridently Protestant and anti-Catholic in nature.

===White supremacy and racism===
Campbell opposed miscegenation. In a lecture in the US, he stated that the races had separate origins and distinct biblical destinies and that black people were the &quot;beasts of the field&quot; referred to in the Bible. In North America, he received a warm welcome from white-supremacist bodies including the Ku Klux Klan. Campbell supported apartheid in South Africa, was critical of unionist politicians meeting Nelson Mandela and called Desmond Tutu a &quot;little black man&quot;. Campbell used his website to promote the views of his colleague Sheldon Emery, an author with white supremacist views. He also faced the charge of supporting racist opinions held by a South African colleague who argued that God did not want different races to be joined together; a Free Presbyterian minister charged Campbell with holding &quot;abhorrent&quot; views and with disseminating &quot;racist and blasphemous&quot; information. Former South African leader F.W. de Klerk was excoriated by Campbell for betraying white people to &quot;black heathens&quot;.

Campbell employed terminology such as non-white Christians needing to keep to &quot;their own little Negro Churches&quot;. In autumn 2003, Campell, who was anti-Islamic in outlook, told a gathering in London that the threat from Islam was not make believe. Campbell was a frequent contributor to the racist Euro Folk Radio.

==Political activities==
===Shankill Defence Association===
In May 1969, Campbell was involved in the creation of the Shankill Defence Association. This organisation, led by McKeague, was the precursor to the UDA.

===Protestant Unionist Party===
Campbell was also an early member of the Protestant Unionist Party, established by Paisley in 1966. When it became the DUP, Campbell was one of that party&#x27;s earliest members and became secretary to one of its branches.

===Loyal Orders===
As well as being a lifetime member of the Orange Order and Apprentice Boys, Campbell was cited as an authority on the Orange Order as seen through the publication &quot;Let The Orange Banners Speak&quot;.

===George Seawright===
Campbell attached himself to firebrand Shankill loyalist George Seawright, who came to prominence around 1980. He was also key in the re-establishment of the Ulster Protestant League under Seawright in early 1985. Campbell later wrote a book on Seawright after the latter&#x27;s murder by republicans in 1987.

===Drumcree protest and LVF===
Campbell attended the protests at Drumcree in 1995-96, taking advantage of the gathering of thousands of loyalists and the high-profile nature of the protest to restate his uncompromising credentials. Another longtime fundamentalist preacher stressed that Campbell had never played a central role in loyalism, on account of his extreme non-biblical views, but had resurfaced at Drumcree.

Campbell was instrumental in Billy Wright setting up the LVF, after his and his brigade&#x27;s expulsion from the UVF for shooting dead a Catholic civilian and thereby fracturing the loyalist ceasefire. Playing on the UVF&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for what was going on at Drumcree and, in particular, on Wright&#x27;s evangelical Christian outlook, Campbell argued that a new organisation would be akin to &quot;army of God&quot; undertaking a holy war.

===Paramilitary ceasefires===
In summer 1996, Campbell, then chaplain of a branch of the Apprentice Boys named after Seawright, observed that the loyalist ceasefire had been a betrayal. He considered the IRA ceasefire insincere and a threat to unionist hegemony.

Three years later, an unknown group called the Nationalist Defence Force sent a bullet to Campbell, apparently as a threat to his life.

===Good Friday Agreement===
Campbell was viscerally opposed to the Good Friday Agreement. A &quot;self-appointed pastor&quot;, Campbell was considered the &quot;spiritual head&quot; of a loose association of loyalist religious and paramilitary extremists that came together to fight the agreement and see the loyalist ceasefire break down.

On 24 April 1998, Campbell joined Peeples in speaking at a loyalist gathering in Antrim to protest at the Good Friday Agreement. During the rally, members of the crowd were heard to chant &quot;Burn Fenians&quot;. A few hours later a Catholic man was shot dead in a nearby town by members of the LVF police believed were present at the protest meeting in Antrim. Campbell also joined other loyalists in a protest against the Ulster Unionist Party discussing peace moves in spring 1998. Following the Good Friday Agreement, Campbell urged a gathering in England to reject the forthcoming referendum and never to countenance the sharing of power or giving the Irish government a say in Northern Ireland. Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was denounced by him: &quot;He is to Ulster what De Klerk was to South Africa. He is the traitor of all traitors&quot;. Campbell continued to campaign for a referendum vote against the agreement.

Campbell was spotted paying a visit in early 2001 to his longtime friend Peeples, who was serving a ten-year term in Maghaberry jail for possession of weapons.

===Orange Volunteers/Red Hand Defenders===
Campbell, described as a &quot;hate-filled bigot&quot;, was named as one of the founders of the Orange Volunteers, a &quot;shadowy quasi-religious terror group&quot; established to counter the peace process in and which engaged in attacks on Catholics and Catholic property. He was also closely involved with the Red Hand Defenders, a group with similar aims, writing a number of its press releases and offering biblical support for that group&#x27;s murderous activities.

===Harryville Church protest===
Campbell was a participant in the loyalist Harryville Church street protests in Ballymena in the late 1990s.

===Flag protests===
Campbell participated in, and was photographed at, loyalist street protests in 2013 in Belfast city centre at a decision not to fly the Union flag each day over Belfast City Hall.

===MI5 and agent provocateur===
Both commentators and prominent political figures like David Ervine portrayed Campbell as an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;, controlled by British intelligence, who inflamed passions among young loyalists. Journalist Henry McDonald, an authority on loyalism, opined that Campbell, while on the periphery of the loyalist agenda for many years, was one of a number of &quot;false prophets&quot; who would never get their hands dirty but rather persuade others to engage in a &quot;brand of holy war&quot; by stoking sectarian feelings. In that regard, Campbell advocated the use of weapons in defence of Ulster. Campbell, clearly identified as &quot;The Pastor&quot; who came and went as crises arose, may have been blackmailed to become a British agent or &quot;puppet&quot;; however, others went to prison for many years for acting on his words. Campbell&#x27;s role in &quot;dirty tricks&quot; is seen in an arson attack on a Baptist church in Templemore Avenue on 1 April 1997. This outrage was initially blamed on Catholics from the nearby nationalist Short Strand. However, David Ervine confirmed three weeks later that it was the work of people connected to the LVF in an attempt to derail peace efforts.

Garland, a former member of Tara (a shadowy organisation Campbell never joined), described Campbell as being involved in anonymous letters and making nasty phone calls. While Campbell kept a low profile, his veneer of respectability, it was alleged, was destroyed by the extremist content of his online publications.

==Schoolteacher==
Campbell held the post of head of religious studies at Newtownabbey Community High School in greater Belfast. The &quot;Newsletter&quot;, a unionist newspaper, noted that Campbell had faced questions over his role in loyalist material being disseminated online when a &quot;respected RE teacher&quot; was required to be sensitive towards what others believe. One newspaper had contacted Campbell&#x27;s employers for those publications having encouraged sectarianism.

==Paedophile activities==
===Background===
Campbell was a close friend of William McGrath and a frequent visitor to his house; John McKeague was another of his close associates. All three men were named as a member of the Belfast paedophile network controlled by British intelligence. He was the youngest member of this paedophile network and lived a &quot;charmed life&quot; as a &quot;protected agent of the British state&quot;. Campbell was believed to be an important suspect in the disappearance of a number of boys in the Belfast area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Unionist politician John Carson was allegedly aware that Campbell was believed to be involved in those of 1969.

Investigative journalist and author on the Kincora scandal, Chris Moore, believes &quot;it’s important the public know the full story about this evil man&quot;, whom another author terms &quot;a child rapist&quot;.

===Indecent assault prosecution===
On 3 November 1970, Campbell, aged 21, picked up a boy on public transport in Belfast city centre. He brought the child to Ross House, a complex of flats on Belfast&#x27;s Shore Road. There he sexually abused the boy in the flat of his friend and fellow paedophile Ken Larmour who was in hospital at the time and had given Campbell a key to his flat. Campbell threatened to knife the boy if he ever revealed what had happened. At that time the victim was attending Bawnmore Boys Home and was later sent to Kincora Boys&#x27; Home, where he was abused by McGrath. Campbell was charged with gross indecency with a child but not convicted due to a fake alibi that was later withdrawn. Campbell had earlier sought advice from McGrath, and from Larmour who worked as a magistrates’ court clerk. Larmour coached Campbell on how to beat this charge: he advised Campbell to admit that he had brought the boy to the flat but to deny that anything untoward had taken place. Larmour was suspected of doctoring court papers to help Campbell escape conviction.

Despite Campbell&#x27;s recollection that at the time he had been &quot;a man clutching at straws in an emergency&quot;, when the matter came before a magistrate in Belfast in May 1971, the case was dismissed. Protestant Unionist Party councillor Margaret Miskimmin, who visited Larmour&#x27;s flat with Campbell and others on 11 November 1970, provided Campbell with a bogus alibi. Miskimmin only retracted this evidence years later when she realised she could get into trouble for &quot;telling lies to the police&quot;. It was recommended in August 1982 that Campbell be prosecuted for suborning Miskimmin and her husband to commit perjury, but the DPP ordered that no charges be levied against Campbell.

Although Campbell was prosecuted at magistrate&#x27;s court level only, he was defended by leading QC and DUP co-founder Desmond Boal. 

It is clear that discussion of the police&#x27;s recommendations about prosecuting Campbell took place at ministerial level in London. In a document seen by the attorney-general, Campbell was noted as a member of the DUP who was still worshipping at Paisley&#x27;s church at the time of the 1971 assault and that perjured evidence had led to his escaping conviction.

Detective Superintendent G.R. Harrison of Sussex Police, who investigated Kincora and related matters in May 1983 (the &quot;Terry Report&quot;), reported that the failure and &quot;poor memory&quot; of RUC Detective Chief Inspector Matchett to act effectively over Campbell having suborned a number of people over this prosecution supported press claims that Campbell was being protected.

Police records relating to Campbell were destroyed as required by operating procedures, while the evidential file against him was believed lost in a bomb attack. The 1971 prosecution being dismissed had no negative consequences for Campbell, who later obtained a teaching job at a secondary school.

Campbell asserted that this prosecution was a conspiracy on the part of the RUC &quot;to shut me up&quot;. The court case was not reported in the local press.

===Murder of Brian McDermott===
Campbell was named as the chief suspect in the murder of Brian McDermott, a ten-year-old boy who disappeared from near his East Belfast home in September 1973. Campbell left Belfast very soon afterwards to begin a history degree course at the University of London. He is believed to have failed to disclose information about the boy&#x27;s disappearance, and a former British Army officer is quoted as stating that Campbell deserved &quot;very close examination&quot; about this murder and similar matters. In a BBC interview c. 2020, former members of the RUC claimed that they had been told not to take Campbell into custody to be interviewed about evidence linking him to the boy&#x27;s death. Therefore, he avoided arrest or questioning. Years later the BBC withdrew at a very late stage the showing of a documentary on Campbell&#x27;s likely involvement in the McDermott murder.

==Church activities==
===Bethel Pentecostal Church===
Campbell was one of those involved in an attempted ousting of Rev. John Hull, pastor of Bethel Pentecostal Church in Berlin Street off the Shankill Road, by Peeples and UVF Miami Showband killer John Somerville in 2005. Key to the dispute was Peeples’ promotion of Campbell’s &quot;Rome Watch&quot; publication. Pastor Hull was eventually restored as minister after the involvement of legal experts.

===Closure of church===
It was reported in December 2013 that Campbell&#x27;s church had shut down. Campbell had been very ill earlier that year with kidney trouble. In his absence, financial difficulties and irregularities had led to Open Bible Ministries having to close. Campbell was put in the spotlight over assertions that a shady person connected to him had stolen over £20,000 in a twelve-month period. Campbell refuted these claims.

==Death and funeral==
Campbell collapsed at his home in an apartment block off Belfast&#x27;s Shore Road before an ambulance took him to hospital, where he could not be saved. He died on 11 June 2017 and was buried five days later at Roselawn Cemetery in the east of the city. His funeral service in north Belfast, presided over by Pastor Ken Davidson of Christ Encounters Tabernacle, was attended by approximately 40 mourners. Campell left more than £60,000 to his live-in carer Raffi (Albert Leca). Amongst tributes to Campbell was one from the Association of the Covenant people which noted that the &quot;Irish Warrior&quot;, although very ill in recent times, had assisted their work. Other death notices included &quot;Will be missed . I know my Redeemer liveth&quot; from close friends Tommy Doyle and Lily Green and their wider families.

<text>Lulworth Cove is a cove near the village of West Lulworth, on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, southern England. The cove is one of the world&#x27;s finest examples of such a landform, and is a World Heritage Site and tourist location with approximately 500,000 visitors every year, of whom about 30 per cent visit in July and August. It is close to the rock arch of Durdle Door and other Jurassic Coast sites.

== Geology ==

The cove has formed as a result of bands of rock of alternating geological resistance running parallel to the coastline (a concordant coastline). On the seaward side the clays and sands have been eroded.

A narrow (less than ) band of Portland limestone rocks forms the shoreline. Behind this is a narrow (less than ) band of slightly less-resistant Purbeck limestone. Behind this are of much less-resistant clays and greensands; Weald Clays, Gault and Upper Greensand.

Forming the back of the cove is a band of chalk, which is considerably more resistant than the clays and sands, but less resistant than the limestones. The entrance to the cove is a narrow gap in the limestone bands, formed by wave action and weathering. The wide part of the cove is where the weak clays and greensands have been eroded.
Stair Hole, less than to the west, is an infant cove which suggests what Lulworth Cove would have looked like a few hundred thousand years ago. The sea has made a gap in the Portland and Purbeck limestone here to the Wealden clays and begun eroding them.

==Geography==
The shape of the cove is a result of wave diffraction. The narrow entrance to the cove causes waves to bend into an arc shape, as is visible in the panorama photograph.
== Conservation ==
As well as the cove, across Hambury Tout (the large chalk hill to the west) is Durdle Door, a natural arch. To the east there is a fossilised forest. Lulworth is also close to Kimmeridge, famous for its rocky shore and fossils. Geologists and geographers have been interested in the area since the beginning of the 19th century, and in the 1830s the first serious study of the area took place. Since then the area has drawn students from all over the world.

The area suffers from trampling from its many visitors. Wooden steps, fences and steps have been put in place to limit this surface damage. Each year over 250,000 people walk across the hill linking the cove to Durdle Door.

In 2001 the coast was granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO. Experts at UNESCO have been working on preserving the shape of Lulworth Cove. Lulworth was one of a number of gateway villages on the coast with a Heritage Centre—part visitor centre, tourist information and natural history museum; in 2002 the last received 418,595 visitors.

The coast and land to the north and around the village is privately owned and managed by the Lulworth Estate. Land to the east, including Tyneham, is owned by the Ministry of Defence and used for tank training; it is open only at weekends and holidays.

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Four Sided Triangle&quot; (1953)
* &quot;Nuts in May&quot; (1976)
* &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot; (1982)
* &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Walking Through History&quot; (2013)
* &quot;World War Z&quot; (2013)

== Miscellaneous ==
The bay of Lulworth Sinus in the largest hydrocarbon sea, Kraken Mare, on Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan, is named after Lulworth Cove.

<text>The ATR 72 is a twin-engine turboprop, short-haul regional airliner developed and produced in France and Italy by aircraft manufacturer ATR.
The number &quot;72&quot; in its name is derived from the aircraft&#x27;s typical standard seating capacity of 72 passengers.
The ATR 72 has also been used as a corporate transport, cargo aircraft, and maritime patrol aircraft.

To date, all of the ATR series have been completed at the company&#x27;s final assembly line in Toulouse, France; ATR benefits from sharing resources and technology with Airbus SE, which has continued to hold a 50% interest in the company. Successive models of the ATR 72 have been developed. Typical updates have included new avionics, such as a glass cockpit, and the adoption of newer engine versions to deliver enhanced performance, such as increased efficiency and reliability and reductions in operating costs. The aircraft shares a high degree of commonality with the smaller ATR 42, which remains in production as of 2024.

==History==

ATR ( or ) is a joint venture formed by French aerospace company Aérospatiale (now part of Airbus) and Italian aviation conglomerate Aeritalia (now Leonardo S.p.A.). 
During the 1980s, French aerospace company Aérospatiale and Italian aviation conglomerate Aeritalia merged their work on a new generation of regional aircraft. The new jointly owned company, ATR, was established to develop, manufacture, and market their first airliner, later designated the ATR 42. On 16 August 1984, the first model of the series, designated as the ATR 42-300, performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight. During the mid-1980s, the ATR 72 was developed as a stretched variant of the ATR 42. On 27 October 1989, Finnish airline Finnair became the first airline to operate this type in revenue service.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===

During the mid-1980s, ATR sought to introduce a larger airliner with increased capacity over its earlier products. This new regional airliner, designated as the ATR 72, was directly developed from the earlier ATR 42 and had much in common with it; the principal difference between the two airliners was an increase in the maximum seating capacity from 48 to 78 passengers. This was principally achieved by stretching the fuselage by , along with an increase of the wingspan, the use of more powerful engines, and increased fuel capacity by about 10%.

On 15 January 1986, the launch of the stretched ATR 72 programme was announced. On 27 October 1988, the prototype performed its maiden flight. One year later, on 25 September 1989, the ATR 72 received airworthiness certification from the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation. The following month, on 27 October 1989, Finnish airline Finnair became the first to introduce the aircraft into service. Since the ATR 72 is assembled on the same production line as the smaller ATR 42, along with sharing the majority of subsystems, components, and manufacturing techniques, the two types support each other to remain in production. This factor may have been crucial as, by 2015, the ATR 42 was the only 50-seat regional aircraft still being manufactured.

In 2000, the combined global ATR fleet reached its 10,000,000th flight, during which a distance of around 4 billion km (2.5 billion statute miles) and around 450 million passengers had flown on board ATR-built aircraft. The 2007 production set a new record for the programme&#x27;s sales; a total of 113 new ATR aircraft had been ordered during a single year. By the end of 2014, ATR had received 1,000 orders for the type and delivered 754, leaving a backlog of 246 aircraft.

Various organisational changes were implemented within the ATR company. On 10 July 1998, ATR launched its new Asset Management Department. In June 2001, EADS and Alenia Aeronautica, ATR&#x27;s parent companies, decided to reinforce their partnership, regrouping all industrial activities related to regional airliners into the ATR consortium. On 3 October 2003, ATR became one of the first aircraft manufacturers to be certified under ISO 9001-2000 and EN/AS/JISQ 9100, the worldwide quality standard for the aeronautics industry. During July 2004, ATR and Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer announced a co-operation agreement on the AEROChain Portal to deliver improved customer service. During April 2009, ATR announced the launch of its &#x27;Door-2-Door&#x27; service as a new option in its comprehensive customer services range.
In 2017, the 72-600 unit cost was US$26.0 million.

=== Further development ===

As of October 2007, the current production version is the &quot;ATR 72-600&quot; series. On 2 October 2007, ATR CEO Stéphane Mayer announced the launch of the -600 series aircraft; the ATR 42-600 and ATR 72-600 featured various improvements to increase efficiency, dispatch reliability, lower fuel burn, and operating costs. While broadly similar to the earlier -500 model, differences include adopting improved PW127M engines, a new glass cockpit, and various other minor improvements.

Since 2008, ATR has been a participant in the European Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative. On 8 July 2015, an ATR 72-600 &#x27;green&#x27; technology demonstrator performed its first flight; the demonstrator was used for testing new composite materials for insulation, air conditioning systems, electrical distribution systems, and energy dispersal modifications to evaluate their effect on the aircraft&#x27;s overall efficiency as a contribution to the Clean Sky initiative. ATR&#x27;s senior vice-president for engineering Alessandro Amendola indicated that the elimination of all uses of bleed air was a key aim in the designing of an all-electric architecture as well as improving engine efficiency; the minimising of peak electrical loads was also a stated priority. During March 2016, a second round of flight trials dedicated the testing of all-electric systems architecture using the demonstrator was completed; analysis is set to continue.

As a consequence of strong demand for the -600 series, ATR decided to invest in the establishment of a second, more modern final assembly line and acquisition of more hangar space at its Toulouse site, along with a new large completion and delivery area; overall, the manufacturing operation expanded to four times the footprint that it had in 2005. Speaking in October 2015, ATR CEO Patrick de Castelbajac stated that the firm was set to produce in excess of 90 aircraft that year, and that the new manufacturing facilities could support a production rate of up to 120 per year. At the time, the company had a backlog of orders for 300 aircraft, sufficient for three years of production. During 2017, a new in-house financing and leasing division was established by ATR in order to offer customers a greater degree of support and expand the company&#x27;s range of services.

In December 2015, the EASA approved a new high-density seating layout, raising the maximum capacity from 74 to 78 seats. During the 2021 Dubai Airshow in mid-November 2021, ATR debuted the new ATR 72-600 powered by new PW127XT powerplants with 20% lower maintenance cost and 3% lower fuel consumption than the predecessor PW127M powerplant.

Considerable emphasis has been placed upon the continuous development of ATR&#x27;s aircraft models. Speaking at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2016, the CEO of ATR Patrick de Castelbajac stated that the company was currently examining the possibility of replacing the current Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW127 engine with either a new offer from P&amp;WC, or a GE38 derivative from GE Aviation. Although expressing satisfaction with the PW127 engine and its supplier, Castelbajac noted the design&#x27;s age and the need to remain competitive with the latest regional jets. To be a worthwhile exercise, any re-engine exercise would require a 15 per cent improvement in fuel-burn and 20-25 per cent reduction of direct maintenance costs. Additionally, Castelbajac sees the potential re-engine as a &quot;bridge&quot; to the eventual development of a larger 100-seat aircraft.

During the mid-2010s, reports emerged that the development of a further stretched 90-seat ATR model was under consideration as well; allegedly, shareholder Airbus was relatively unenthusiastic on proceeding with such a development, while Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier favoured a focus on resolving manufacturing issues. However, in January 2018, ATR&#x27;s parent company Leonardo announced that the 100-seat program has been formally brought to a close.

== Design ==

The ATR 72 is a turboprop-powered regional airliner, capable of accommodating a maximum of 78 passengers. It is powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW100 turboprop engines, which drive an arrangement of four or six-bladed propellers supplied by Hamilton Standard. Earlier models of the ATR 72 are equipped with the older PW124B engine, rated at , while later-built aircraft are powered by the newer PW127 engine, rated at a maximum of to achieve improved &quot;hot and high&quot; takeoff performance. It can land and takeoff in high airports with short runways like Andorra Airport. It employs carbonfibres for 30% of the wing by weight, for a 20% weight reduction.

In a standard configuration, the aircraft does not have an auxiliary power unit; when present it is installed within the C4 cargo section. Most operators of the ATR 72 equip their aircraft with a propeller brake that stops the propeller on the No. 2 (right) engine while allowing the turbine to continue running, to provide both airflow and electrical power to the aircraft while on the ground. (This arrangement is referred to as &quot;Hotel Mode&quot;.)

In the majority of configurations, passengers board the ATR 72 using the rear door, a relatively unusual configuration for a passenger aircraft, while the front door is typically used for the loading and unloading of cargo; early customer Finnair intentionally ordered its ATR 72s with a front passenger door so that it could utilize the jet bridges at Helsinki Airport, while operator Air New Zealand&#x27;s standard rear door aircraft can use jet bridges at airports with this equipment. While passengers are boarding or disembarking, a tail stand is set into place as standard procedure to guard against the aircraft nose lifting off the ground.

== Operational history ==
2011 was a record-breaking year for sales at ATR. According to ATR&#x27;s CEO Filippo Bagnato, sales had continued to grow during the Great Recession despite the downturn experienced by most aviation companies as &quot;fuel consumption that can be half that of the alternatives and [with] lower maintenance costs&quot;. Bagnato noted the strength of Africa as a market for the type, as well at the firm&#x27;s aircraft being capable of serving destinations that would otherwise be inaccessible to other aircraft due to the austere conditions of many airstrips and runways in the region, as well as the ability to operate autonomously without any reliance upon ground support equipment.

For 2013, ATR claimed a 48 percent global market share for regional aircraft deliveries between 50 and 90 seats (comprising both turboprops and jets), making it the dominant manufacturer in this market segment. That same year, during which firm orders for 10 ATR 42-600s and 79 ATR 72-600s were recorded, leasing companies were responsible for 70 per cent of these; according to ATR&#x27;s CEO Filippo Bagnato: &quot;Years ago, we were not even considered by the lessors; now they see ATRs as a good investment&quot;. Several major leasing companies operate their own ATR fleets, such as Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), who placed an order for 20 ATR 72s along with options for another 20 in February 2014, and Nordic Aviation Capital (NAC), who ordered a fleet of 30 ATR 72s during June 2013, along with options for up to 55 further airliners. Placing their first order during 2011, by December 2012, Singaporean leasor Avation had a combined total of 20 ATR 72s on order; by February 2016, the number on order for had risen to 35 aircraft.

During May 1997, ATR achieved their first breakthrough sale in China, placed by operator China Xinjiang Airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). By 2013, while the Asia Pacific region had comprised the majority of ATR&#x27;s sales when geographically ranked; however, orders from Chinese airlines remained elusive; Bagnato ascribed this anomaly to local market conditions dictating the typical use of larger aircraft, as well as a Chinese government policy of imposing high tariffs on the import of foreign-built fixed-wing aircraft. During late 2014, ATR set up a new office in Beijing and hired several former Airbus sales personnel with the aim of launching the type in the Chinese market. ATR believed that many of the already-flown routes did not suit larger 150-seat aircraft; however, of the roughly 2,600 commercial aircraft flying in China at that time, only 68 had a capacity of less than 90 seats and of these, fewer than 20 were powered by turboprop engines.

In response to airlines often wanting to replace their early production ATR models with the latest generation ATR series, as well as to answer demand from cargo operators for the type, ATR has operated two separate dedicated freighter conversion programmes, known as the Bulk Freighter (tube version) and the ULD Freighter. Both conversions involve complete stripping of furnishings along with the addition of floor strengthening, new window plugs and 9 g restraining nets, six additional longitudinal tracks for added flexibility, and an E-Class cabin; the ULD model can accommodate standard ULD-packaged cargo, such as LD3 containers or pallets, which were loaded via a large cargo door located on the port forward side. Undertaken by a range of companies, such as Alenia subsidiary Aeronavali, Texas-based M7 Aerospace; French firms Indraéro Siren and Aeroconseil, Canadian Infinion Certification Engineering, and Spanish company Arrodisa, by October 2012, in excess of one-fifth of all first-generation ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft had already been converted to freighters.

=== Iran Air ===

During February 2016, ATR signed a deal with flag carrier Iran Air for a batch of 20 ATR 72-600s, along with options for 20 more aircraft and post-purchase services, such as engine maintenance. Made possible by a negotiated relaxation of international sanctions against Iran, during June 2017, a €1 billion Iranian contract was finalized for the firm 20 airliners and 20 options; the delivery of the first four aircraft occurred within weeks of the deal being completed. US sanctions against Iran were reimposed in August 2018, by which time 13 of the order of 20 aircraft had been delivered. In April 2019 the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued a two-year licence to ATR to allow it to supply spare parts and other essentials to keep the fleet of 13 ATR 72-600s in operation. However, the remaining 7 ATR 72-600s from the 2016 order remain sanctioned and in storage.

=== Turkish Navy ===
While primarily used as a civil aircraft, some ATR 72s have been adapted to perform in various military functions, such as utility aircraft and maritime patrol aircraft (MPA). The Turkish Navy, which initially decided to purchase ten ATR 72-500 MPA, later changed its order to eight aircraft: Two ATR 72-600 TMUA (Turkish Maritime Utility Aircraft) versions, and six ATR 72-600 TMPA (Turkish Maritime Patrol Aircraft for MP/ASW/ASuW duties) versions. The armed ATR 72 TMPA variant was developed in cooperation with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), and incorporated additional sensors and mission systems to perform its intended combat role. During 2013, the two ATR 72-600 TMUA aircraft were delivered to the Turkish Navy. The first ATR 72-600 TMPA was delivered in December 2020 and the second one in March 2021 was already in service with Turkish Navy. As of May 2021, 3 ATR 72-600 TMUA aircraft are being operated by the Turkish Navy.

=== Italian Air Force ===
The Italian Air Force selected the ATR 72-600 MP, designated as the &quot;P-72A&quot;, to serve as a multirole maritime patrol, electronic surveillance and C4 platform. The original Italian requirement for a Breguet Atlantic replacement had also called for ASW and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capabilities, however, during 2014, the contract was renegotiated to a configuration that excluded these capabilities. An anticipated variant for ASW and ASuW operations may later be pursued; accordingly, provisions were made to allow for the four P-72As on order to be adapted to the ASW configuration. In December 2016, the first pair of P-72A aircraft were delivered to the Italian Air Force. The last aircraft was delivered to the Italian Air Force in February 2021.

=== Guardia di Finanza ===
A single ATR 72 MP was ordered by Italy&#x27;s paramilitary Guardia di Finanza (GdF) in July 2019, followed by an order for a further three ATR 72s in October 2019. The aircraft, called P-72B by Guardia di Finanza, will supplement the GdF&#x27;s existing force of four ATR-42s in the border surveillance, maritime patrol and search and rescue roles.

=== FedEx Express ===
On 8 November 2017, FedEx Express launched the -600 cargo variant with 30 firm orders plus 20 options, in a freighter configuration from the factory.

As of September 2018, 187 early variants had been produced with 172 operated by 55 carriers, 365 -500s were delivered with more than 350 in service at 75 operators, 444 -600s were produced and are operated by 74 carriers with a backlog of 231 orders.
By then, with more than 60 -500s and 40 -600s in storage, new aircraft leases fell to $130,000 per month from $170,000.
The -600 list price of $26.8M is typically discounted by 25% for a $M value, a 2012 aircraft is valued $13.3M and leased $115,000, falling to $10.2M and $100,000 in 2021, a D check costs $0.5M and the engine overhaul costs $0.3-1.0M.

=== Failed bids ===
==== Germany ====
The ATR 72 was a candidate to replace the German Navy&#x27;s P-3, at least as a stopgap solution from 2025 to 2032. Germany ultimately selected the P-8A Poseidon in 2021.

:A purpose-built freighter variant of the -600, 8 November 2017 launch with 30 firm orders from FedEx plus 20 options. The first flight of the variant took place on 16 September 2020; it was EASA certified by early December. In December 2020, FedEx Express received the first one of its order of 30, to be operated by ASL Airlines Ireland between Paris Charles de Gaulle and the Czech Republic. FedEx should receive six aircraft per year until 2025, later freighters will fly in the US and in Latin America. Compared to the passenger airliner, windows are removed, the floor is reinforced and a large front cargo door is added to load seven LD3 containers. ATR forecasts a market for 460 converted or new-build turboprop freighters over 20 years.

=== Other versions ===
; Cargo
: Bulk Freighter (tube versions) and ULD Freighter (Large Cargo Door). ATR unveiled a large cargo door modification for all ATR 72 at Farnborough 2002, coupled with a dedicated cargo conversion. FedEx, DHL, and UPS all operate the type.

; Corporate
: A VIP version of the -500 is available with a luxury interior for executive or corporate transport.

; ATR 82
: During the mid-1980s, the company investigated a 78-seat derivative of the ATR 72. This would have been powered by two Allison AE2100 turboprops (turbofans were also studied for a time) and would have had a cruising speed as high as . The ATR-82 project (as it was dubbed) was suspended when AI(R) was formed in early 1996.

; ATR 82 TF
: ATR also studied a turbofan version of the proposed ATR 82 (stretched version of the ATR 72) in the early 1990s. Powered by either the Allison GMA 3012 or the General Electric CF34, the aircraft would have a range of about and cruise at at an altitude of .

; ATR Quick Change
: This proposed version targeted the increasing demand of worldwide cargo and express mail markets, where the aim is to allow operators to supplement their passengers flights with freighter flights. In Quick Change configuration, the smoke detector is equipped alongside other modifications required in order to meet the certification for full freight operations. The aircraft was equipped with a larger cargo door (1.27 m [50 in] wide and 1.52 m [60 in] high) and low door-sill height of an average 1.2 m (4 ft), facilitating containerised freight loading. It takes 30 minutes to convert the ATR 42, and 45 minutes to convert the ATR 72. Each optimized container has of usable volume and maximum payload is 435 kg (960 lb).

<text>László Hunyadi or Ladislaus Hunyadi (Slovak: &quot;Ladislav Huňady&quot;; 1431 – 16 March 1457) was a Hungarian nobleman.

Ladislaus Hunyadi was the elder of the two sons of John Hunyadi, voivode of Transylvania and later regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, and Elizabeth Szilágyi. He was the older brother of Matthias Hunyadi, who would later become the king of Hungary. At a very early age he accompanied his father in his campaigns. After the Battle of Kosovo (1448) he was left for a time, as a hostage for his father, in the hands of George Brankovic (1427–1456), despot of Serbia. In 1452 he was a member of the deputation which went to Vienna to receive back the Hungarian king Ladislaus V. In 1453 he was already ban of Croatia and Dalmatia. At the diet of Buda (1455) he resigned all his dignities, because of the accusations of Ulrich II, Count of Celje, and other enemies of his house, but a reconciliation was ultimately patched together and he was betrothed to Anna, the daughter of the palatine, Ladislaus Garai.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1456, he was declared by his enemy Ulrich II (now Captain General of Hungary with significant power) responsible for the debts allegedly owed by the elder Hunyadi to the state; but he defended himself so ably at the diet of Futak (October 1456) that Ulrich feigned a reconciliation, promising to protect the Hunyadis on condition that they first surrendered all the royal castles entrusted to them. A beginning was to be made with the fortress of Nándorfehérvár (now Belgrade, Serbia) of which Hunyadi was commandant. While admitting Ladislaus V and Ulrich, Hunyadi excluded their army of mercenaries. On the following morning (9 November 1456), Ulrich was killed by Hunyadi&#x27;s men in unclear circumstances. Later Hunyadi served as master of the horse () until his death.

The terrified young king thereupon pardoned Hunyadi, and at a subsequent interview with his mother at Temesvár swore that he would protect the whole family. As a pledge of his sincerity he appointed Hunyadi lord treasurer and captain-general of the kingdom. Suspecting no evil, Hunyadi accompanied the king to Buda. But on arriving there he was arrested on a charge of plotting against the king, condemned to death without the observance of any legal formalities, and beheaded on 16 March 1457.

He is the protagonist of a popular Hungarian opera, &quot;Hunyadi László&quot; by Ferenc Erkel.

<text>Vanitas (Latin for &#x27;vanity&#x27;, in this context meaning pointlessness, or futility, not to be confused with the other definition of vanity) is a genre of symbolizing the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death, and thus the vanity of ambition and all worldly desires. The paintings involved still life imagery of transitory items. The genre began in the 16th century and continued into the 17th century. Vanitas art is a type of allegorical art representing a higher ideal. It was a sub-genre of painting heavily employed by Dutch painters during the Baroque period (c.1585–1730). Spanish painters working at the end of the Spanish Golden Age also created vanitas paintings.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;vanitas&quot; comes from Latin and means vanity. In this context, vanity means pointlessness, or futility, not to be confused with the other definition of vanity. Vanity is referenced in the Hebrew Bible in Ecclesiastes 12:8, &quot;Vanity of Vanities, saith the preacher, all is vanity&quot;. In some versions vanity is translated as &quot;meaningless&quot; to avoid the confusion with the other definition of vanity, that being inflated pride in oneself or one&#x27;s appearance. The message is that human action is temporary and faith is forever. &quot;Memento mori&quot; is a similar theme which when translated from Latin means, &quot;remember that you will die.&quot;

== History ==
A group of painters in Leiden began to produce vanitas paintings in the beginning of the 16th century and they continued into the 17th century. Vanitas art is an allegorical art representing a higher ideal or containing hidden meanings. Vanitas are very formulaic and they use literary and traditional symbols to convey mortality. Vanitas often have a message that is rooted in religion or the Christian Bible.

In the 17th century, the vanitas genre was popular among Dutch painters. The paintings often have symbolic imagery which attempts to convey the message that all people die, encouraging the viewer to think about the futility of our earthly pursuits. The well-known Spanish vanitas refer to Spain&#x27;s rulers and the politics of Spain. It was popular to include skulls in vanitas paintings as a symbol of the ephemeral nature of life.

<doc id="285041" wikidata="Q956635" url="?curid=285041" title="Kosava, Belarus">
<text>Kosava or Kossovo (; ; ), formerly known as Kosava-Palyeskaye, is a town in Ivatsevichy District, Brest Region, in western Belarus. As of 2024, it has a population of 1,862.

The nearby village of Merechevschina is the birthplace of Tadeusz Kościuszko, with Kosava being the place of his baptism. Kosava is the birthplace of Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz. Nearby is the ruined Kosava Castle, built by the Pusłowski family in 1830, and a replica of Tadeusz Kościuszko&#x27;s house in &quot;Mereczowszczyzna&quot;.

==History==
The first settlements in the area are known since the 10th and 11th centuries as part of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The first mention of the town was in 1494, when it was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was a private town of the Chreptowicz, Sanguszko, Sapieha, Flemming, Czartoryski and Pusłowski noble families, administratively located in the Slonim County in the Nowogródek Voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Tadeusz Kościuszko, after being born in nearby Mereczowszczyzna in 1746, was baptized at the local church. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, it became part of the Russian Empire. The town was industrialized by the Pusłowski family.

From 1915 to 1918, the town was under German occupation during World War I. After the Polish–Soviet War, it was part of the Polesie Voivodeship in Poland, within which it was a county seat until it was moved to Iwacewicze in 1935. On 3 February 1927, as Polish newspaper &quot;Robotnik&quot; reported, Polish policemen shot manifestation of peasants that claimed to release imprisoned deputies.

Following the 1939 invasion of Poland, the town was first occupied by the Soviet Union until 1941, then by Nazi Germany until 1944. In 1941, the Germans established a ghetto for Jews, both locals and refugees who had previously fled the German occupiers from western and central Poland. The ghetto was liquidated in July 1942 with the Jews either deported to other locations or massacred in nearby Mereczowszczyzna. In July 1944, the town was re-occupied by the Soviet Union, and eventually annexed from Poland the following year.

<doc id="285044" wikidata="Q26258435" url="?curid=285044" title="Khajuraho Group of Monuments">
<text>The Khajuraho Group of Monuments are a group of Hindu and Jain temples in Chhatarpur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. They are about southeast of Jhansi, from Khajwa, from Rajnagar, and from district headquarter Chhatarpur. The temples are famous for their Nagara-style architectural symbolism and a few erotic sculptures.

Most Khajuraho temples were built between 885 CE and 1000 CE by the Chandela dynasty. Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over . Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over . Of the surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism, and expressiveness of ancient Indian art. The temple complex was forgotten and overgrown by the jungle until 1838 when Captain T.S. Burt, a British engineer, visited the complex and reported his findings in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.

When these monuments were built, the boys in the place lived in hermitages, by being &quot;brahmacharyas&quot; (bachelors) until they attained manhood and these sculptures helped them to learn about the worldly role of &#x27;householder&#x27;. The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region. Because of their outstanding architecture, diversity of temple forms, and testimony to the Chandela civilization, the monuments at Khajuraho were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1986.

== Etymology ==
The name Khajuraho, or &quot;Kharjuravāhaka&quot;, is derived from ancient Sanskrit (&quot;kharjura&quot;, खर्जूर means date palm, and &quot;vāhaka&quot;, वाहक means &quot;one who carries&quot; or bearer). Local legends state that the temples had two golden date-palm trees as their gate (missing when they were rediscovered). Desai states that Kharjuravāhaka also means scorpion bearer, which is another symbolic name for deity Shiva (who wears snakes and scorpion garlands in his fierce form).

Cunningham&#x27;s nomenclature and systematic documentation work in 1850s and 1860s have been widely adopted and continue to be in use. He grouped the temples into the Western group around &quot;Lakshmana&quot;, Eastern group around &quot;Javeri&quot;, and Southern group around &quot;Duladeva&quot;.

== Location ==
The Khajuraho monuments are located in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, in Chatarpur district, about southeast of New Delhi. The temples are located near a small town also known as Khajuraho, with a population of about 24,481 people (2011 Census).

Khajuraho is served by Civil Aerodrome Khajuraho (IATA Code: HJR), with services to Delhi, Agra, Varanasi and Mumbai. The site is also linked by the Indian Railways service, with the railway station located approximately six kilometres from the entrance to the monuments.

The monuments are about ten kilometres off the east-west National Highway 75, and about 50 kilometres from the city of Chhatarpur, which is connected to the state capital Bhopal by the SW-NE running National Highway 86.

The 10th-century Bhand Deva Temple in Rajasthan was built in the style of the Khajuraho monuments and is often referred to as &#x27;Little Khajuraho&#x27;.

== History ==
The Khajuraho group of monuments was built during the rule of the Chandela dynasty. The building activity started almost immediately after the rise of their power, throughout their kingdom to be later known as Bundelkhand. Most temples were built during the reigns of the Hindu kings Yashovarman and Dhanga. Yashovarman&#x27;s legacy is best exhibited by the Lakshmana Temple. Vishvanatha temple best highlights King Dhanga&#x27;s reign. The largest and currently most famous surviving temple is Kandariya Mahadeva built in the reign of King Vidyadhara. The temple inscriptions suggest many of the currently surviving temples were complete between 970 and 1030 CE, with further temples completed during the following decades.

The Khajuraho temples were built about 35 miles from the medieval city of Mahoba, the capital of the Chandela dynasty, in the Kalinjar region. In ancient and medieval literature, their kingdom has been referred to as Jijhoti, Jejahoti, Chih-chi-to and Jejakabhukti.

The first documented mention of Khajuraho was made in 641 by Xuanzang, a Chinese pilgrim who described encountering several dozen inactive Buddhist monasteries and a dozen Hindu temples with a thousand worshipping brahmins. In 1022 CE, Khajuraho was mentioned by Abu Rihan-al-Biruni, the Persian historian who accompanied Mahmud of Ghazni in his raid of Kalinjar; he mentions Khajuraho as the capital of Jajahuti. The raid was unsuccessful, and a peace accord was reached when the Hindu king agreed to pay a ransom to Mahmud of Ghazni to end the attack and leave.

Khajuraho temples were in active use through the end of the 12th century. This changed in the 13th century; after the army of Delhi Sultanate, under the command of the Muslim Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aibak, attacked and seized the Chandela kingdom. About a century later, Ibn Battuta, the Moroccan traveller in his memoirs about his stay in India from 1335 to 1342 CE, mentioned visiting Khajuraho temples, calling them &quot;Kajarra&quot; as follows:

The central Indian region, where Khajuraho temples are, was controlled by various Muslim dynasties from the 13th century through the 18th century. In this period, some temples were desecrated, followed by a long period when they were left in neglect. In 1495 CE, for example, Sikandar Lodi&#x27;s campaign of temple destruction included Khajuraho. The remoteness and isolation of Khajuraho protected the Hindu and Jain temples from continued destruction by Muslims. Over the centuries, vegetation and forests overgrew the temples.

In the 1830s, local Hindus guided a British surveyor, T.S. Burt, to the temples and they were thus rediscovered by the global audience. Alexander Cunningham later reported, few years after the rediscovery, that the temples were secretly in use by yogis and thousands of Hindus would arrive for pilgrimage during Shivaratri celebrated annually in February or March based on a lunar calendar. In 1852, F.C. Maisey prepared earliest drawings of the Khajuraho temples.

== Description ==

The temple site is within Vindhya mountain range in central India. An ancient local legend held that Hindu deity Shiva and other gods enjoyed visiting the dramatic hill formation in Kalinjar area. The center of this region is Khajuraho, set midst local hills and rivers. The temple complex reflects the ancient Hindu tradition of building temples where gods love to pray.

The temples are clustered near water, another typical feature of Hindu temples. The current water bodies include &quot;Sib Sagar&quot;, &quot;Khajur Sagar&quot; (also called Ninora Tal) and &quot;Khudar Nadi&quot; (river). Local legends state that the temple complex had 64 water bodies, of which 56 have been physically identified by archeologists so far.

All temples, except one (Chaturbhuja) face the sunrise – another symbolic feature that is predominant in Hindu temples. The relative layout of temples integrate masculine and feminine deities and symbols highlight the interdependence. The artworks symbolically highlight the four goals of life considered necessary and proper in Hinduism – dharma, kama, artha and moksha.

Of the surviving temples, six are dedicated to Shiva, eight to Vishnu and his affinities, one to Ganesha, one to Sun god, three to Jain Tirthankars. For some ruins, there is insufficient evidence to assign the temple to specific deities with confidence.

An overall examination of site suggests that the Hindu symbolic mandala design principle of square and circles is present each temple plan and design. Further, the territory is laid out in three triangles that converge to form a pentagon. Scholars suggest that this reflects the Hindu symbolism for three realms or &quot;trilokinatha&quot;, and five cosmic substances or &quot;panchbhuteshvara&quot;. The temple site highlights Shiva, the one who destroys and recycles life, thereby controlling the cosmic dance of time, evolution and dissolution.

The temples have a rich display of intricately carved statues. While they are famous for their erotic sculpture, sexual themes cover less than 10% of the temple sculpture. Further, most erotic scene panels are neither prominent nor emphasized at the expense of the rest, rather they are in proportional balance with the non-sexual images. The viewer has to look closely to find them, or be directed by a guide. The arts cover numerous aspects of human life and values considered important in the Hindu pantheon. Further, the images are arranged in a configuration to express central ideas of Hinduism. All three ideas from Āgamas are richly expressed in Khajuraho temples – Avyakta, and .

The Beejamandal temple is under excavation. It has been identified with the Vaidyanath temple mentioned in the Grahpati Kokalla inscription.

Of all temples, the Matangeshvara temple remains an active site of worship. It is another square grid temple, with a large high and diameter lingam, placed on a diameter platform.

The most visited temple, Kandariya Mahadev, has an area of about 6,500 square feet and a shikhara (spire) that rises 116 feet.

===Jain temples===

The Jain temples are located on east-southeast region of Khajuraho monuments. 

The Eastern Group consists of four major Digambara Jaina temples: the ruined Ghantai Temple, the Pārśvanātha Temple, the Ādinātha Temple, and the Śāntinātha Temple, along with several smaller Jaina shrines. Many of these shrines were built on the foundations of earlier structures or using materials from previous temples.

There are numerous strong indications within the architecture of the Pārśvanātha and Ādinātha Temples that they were originally constructed as Hindu temples and later converted into Jaina temples by the Jaina community.

Chausath yogini temple features 64 yogini, while Ghantai temple features bells sculptured on its pillars.

=== Architecture of the temples ===

Khajuraho temples, almost all Hindu temple designs, follow a grid geometrical design called &quot;vastu-purusha-mandala&quot;. This design plan has three important components – &quot;Mandala&quot; means circle, &quot;Purusha&quot; is universal essence at the core of Hindu tradition, while &quot;Vastu&quot; means the dwelling structure.

The design lays out a Hindu temple in a symmetrical, concentrically layered, self-repeating structure around the core of the temple called garbhagriya, where the abstract principle Purusha and the primary deity of the temple dwell. The shikhara, or spire, of the temple rises above the garbhagriya. This symmetry and structure in design is derived from central beliefs, myths, cardinality and mathematical principles.

The circle of mandala circumscribe the square. The square is considered divine for its perfection and as a symbolic product of knowledge and human thought, while circle is considered earthly, human and observed in everyday life (moon, sun, horizon, water drop, rainbow). Each supports the other. The square is divided into perfect 64 sub-squares called padas.

Most Khajuraho temples deploy the 8x8 (64) padas grid Manduka Vastupurushamandala, with pitha mandala the square grid incorporated in the design of the spires. The primary deity or lingas are located in the grid&#x27;s Brahma padas.
The architecture is symbolic and reflects the central Hindu beliefs through its form, structure, and arrangement of its parts. The mandapas, as well as the arts, are arranged in the Khajuraho temples in a symmetric repeating patterns, even though each image or sculpture is distinctive in its own way. The relative placement of the images are not random but together they express ideas, just like connected words form sentences and paragraphs to compose ideas. This fractal pattern that is common in Hindu temples. Various statues and panels have inscriptions. Many of the inscriptions on the temple walls are poems with double meanings, something that the complex structure of Sanskrit allows in creative compositions.

All Khajuraho temples, except one, face sunrise, and the entrance for the devotee is this east side.
Above the vastu-purusha-mandala of each temple is a superstructure with a dome called &quot;Shikhara&quot; (or &quot;Vimana&quot;, Spire). Variations in spire design come from variation in degrees turned for the squares. The temple Shikhara, in some literature, is linked to mount Kailash or Meru, the mythical abode of the gods.

In each temple, the central space typically is surrounded by an ambulatory for the pilgrim to walk around and ritually circumambulate the Purusa and the main deity. The pillars, walls, and ceilings around the space, as well as outside have highly ornate carvings or images of the four just and necessary pursuits of life – kama, artha, dharma, and moksa. This clockwise walk around is called &quot;pradakshina&quot;.

Larger Khajuraho temples also have pillared halls called mandapa. One near the entrance, on the east side, serves as the waiting room for pilgrims and devotees. The mandapas are also arranged by principles of symmetry, grids, and mathematical precision. This use of same underlying architectural principle is common in Hindu temples found all over India. Each Khajuraho temple is distinctly carved yet also repeating the central common principles in almost all Hindu temples, one which Susan Lewandowski refers to as &quot;an organism of repeating cells&quot;.

== Construction ==
The temples are grouped into three geographical divisions: western, eastern and southern.

The Khajuraho temples are made of sandstone, with a granite foundation that is almost concealed from view. The builders didn&#x27;t use mortar: the stones were put together with mortise and tenon joints and they were held in place by gravity. This form of construction requires very precise joints. The columns and architraves were built with megaliths that weighed up to 20 tons. Some repair work in the 19th Century was done with brick and mortar; however, these have aged faster than original materials and darkened with time, thereby seeming out of place.

The Khajuraho and Kalinjar region is home to superior quality of sandstone, which can be carved precisely. The surviving sculpture reflect fine details such as strands of hair, manicured nails, and intricate jewelry.

While recording the television show &quot;Lost Worlds&quot; (History Channel) at Khajuraho, Alex Evans recreated a stone sculpture under four feet that took about 60 days to carve in an attempt to develop a rough idea of how much work must have been involved. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone. They concluded that these temples would have required hundreds of highly trained sculptors.
== Chronology ==
The Khajuraho group of temples belong to Vaishnavism school of Hinduism, Saivism school of Hinduism and Jainism – nearly a third each. Archaeological studies suggest all three types of temples were under construction at about the same time in the late 10th century, and in use simultaneously. Will Durant states that this aspect of Khajuraho temples illustrates the tolerance and respect for different religious viewpoints in the Hindu and Jain traditions. In each group of Khajuraho temples, there were major temples surrounded by smaller temples – a grid style that is observed to varying degrees in Hindu temples in Angkor Wat, Parambaran and South India.

The largest surviving Shiva temple is Khandarya Mahadeva, while the largest surviving Vaishnava group includes Chaturbhuja and Ramachandra.

Kandariya Mahadeva Temple plan is 109 ft in length by 60 ft, and rises 116 ft above ground and 88 ft above its own floor. The central &quot;padas&quot; are surrounded by three rows of sculptured figures, with over 870 statues, most being half life size (2.5 to 3 feet). The spire is a self-repeating fractal structure.

== Arts and sculpture ==

The Khajuraho temples feature a variety of artwork, of which 10% is sexual or erotic art outside and inside the temples. Some of the temples that have two layers of walls have small erotic carvings on the outside of the inner wall. Some scholars suggest these to be tantric sexual practices. Other scholars state that the erotic arts are part of the Hindu tradition of treating kama as an essential and proper part of human life, and its symbolic or explicit display is common in Hindu temples. James McConnachie, in his history of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, describes the sexual-themed Khajuraho sculptures as &quot;the apogee of erotic art&quot;:
Twisting, broad-hipped and high breasted nymphs display their generously contoured and bejewelled bodies on exquisitely worked exterior wall panels. These fleshy &quot;apsaras&quot; run riot across the surface of the stone, putting on make-up, washing their hair, playing games, dancing, and endlessly knotting and unknotting their girdles. ... Beside the heavenly nymphs are serried ranks of griffins, guardian deities and, most notoriously, extravagantly interlocked &quot;maithunas&quot;, or lovemaking couples.
The temples have several thousand statues and artworks, with Kandarya Mahadeva Temple alone decorated with over 870. Some 10% of these iconographic carvings contain sexual themes and various sexual poses. A common misconception is that, since the old structures with carvings in Khajuraho are temples, the carvings depict sex between deities; however, the kama arts represent diverse sexual expressions of different human beings. The vast majority of arts depict various aspects the everyday life, mythical stories as well as symbolic display of various secular and spiritual values important in Hindu tradition. For example, depictions show women putting on makeup, musicians making music, potters, farmers, and other folks in their daily life during the medieval era. These scenes are in the outer padas as is typical in Hindu temples.

There is iconographic symbolism embedded in the arts displayed in Khajuraho temples. Core Hindu values are expressed in multitude of ways. Even the Kama scenes, when seen in combination of sculptures that precede and follow, depict the spiritual themes such as moksha. In the words of Stella Kramrisch,

The Khajuraho temples represent one expression of many forms of arts that flourished in Rajput kingdoms of India from 8th through 10th century CE. For example, contemporary with Khajuraho were the publications of poems and drama such as &quot;Prabodhacandrodaya&quot;, &quot;Karpuramanjari&quot;, &quot;Viddhasalabhanjika&quot; and &quot;Kavyamimansa&quot;. Some of the themes expressed in these literary works are carved as sculpture in Khajuraho temples. Some sculptures at the Khajuraho monuments dedicated to Vishnu include the &quot;Vyalas&quot;, which are hybrid imaginary animals with lions&#x27; bodies, and are found in other Indian temples. Some of these hybrid mythical artwork include &quot;Vrik Vyala&quot; (hybrid of wolf and lion) and &quot;Gaja Vyala&quot; (hybrid of elephant and lion). These &quot;Vyalas&quot; may represent syncretic, creative combination of powers innate in the two.

== Tourism and cultural events ==

The temples in Khajuraho are broadly divided into three parts: the Eastern group, the Southern Group and the Western group of temples of which the Western group alone has the facility of an audio-guided tour wherein the tourists are guided through the seven-eight temples. There is also an audio guided tour developed by the Archaeological Survey of India which includes a narration of the temple history and architecture.

The Khajuraho Dance Festival is held every year in February. It features various classical Indian dances set against the backdrop of the Chitragupta or Vishwanath Temples.

The Khajuraho temple complex offers a son et lumière (sound and light) show every evening. The first show is in English language and the second, in Hindi. It is held in the open lawns in the temple complex, and has received mixed reviews.

<text>Muon-catalyzed fusion (abbreviated as μCF or MCF) is a process allowing nuclear fusion to take place at temperatures significantly lower than the temperatures required for thermonuclear fusion, even at room temperature or lower. It is one of the few known ways of catalyzing nuclear fusion reactions.

Muons are unstable subatomic particles which are similar to electrons but 207 times more massive. If a muon replaces one of the electrons in a hydrogen molecule, the nuclei are consequently drawn 186 times closer than in a normal molecule, due to the reduced mass being 186 times the mass of an electron. When the nuclei move closer together, the fusion probability increases, to the point where a significant number of fusion events can happen at room temperature.

Methods for obtaining muons, however, require far more energy than can be produced by the resulting fusion reactions. Muons have a mean lifetime of , much longer than many other subatomic particles but nevertheless far too brief to allow their useful storage. 

To create useful room-temperature muon-catalyzed fusion, reactors would need a cheap, efficient muon source and/or a way for each individual muon to catalyze many more fusion reactions.

== History ==

Andrei Sakharov and F.C. Frank predicted the phenomenon of muon-catalyzed fusion on theoretical grounds before 1950. Yakov Borisovich Zel&#x27;dovich also wrote about the phenomenon of muon-catalyzed fusion in 1954. Luis W. Alvarez &quot;et al.&quot;, when analyzing the outcome of some experiments with muons incident on a hydrogen bubble chamber at Berkeley in 1956, observed muon-catalysis of exothermic p–d, proton and deuteron, nuclear fusion, which results in a helion, a gamma ray, and a release of about 5.5 MeV of energy. The Alvarez experimental results, in particular, spurred John David Jackson to publish one of the first comprehensive theoretical studies of muon-catalyzed fusion in his ground-breaking 1957 paper. This paper contained the first serious speculations on useful energy release from muon-catalyzed fusion. Jackson concluded that it would be impractical as an energy source, unless the &quot;alpha-sticking problem&quot; (see below) could be solved, leading potentially to an energetically cheaper and more efficient way of utilizing the catalyzing muons.

== Viability as a power source ==

=== Potential benefits ===

If muon-catalyzed d–t nuclear fusion is realized practically, it will be a much more attractive way of generating power than conventional nuclear fission reactors because muon-catalyzed d–t nuclear fusion (like most other types of nuclear fusion), produces far fewer harmful (and far less long-lived) radioactive wastes.

The large number of neutrons produced in muon-catalyzed d–t nuclear fusions may be used to breed fissile fuels from fertile material – for example, thorium-232 could breed uranium-233 in this way. The fissile fuels that have been bred can then be &quot;burned,&quot; either in a conventional critical nuclear fission reactor or in an unconventional subcritical fission reactor, for example, a reactor using nuclear transmutation to process nuclear waste, or a reactor using the energy amplifier concept devised by Carlo Rubbia and others.

Another benefit of muon-catalyzed fusion is that the fusion process can start with pure deuterium gas without tritium. Plasma fusion reactors like ITER or Wendelstein X7 need tritium to initiate and also need a tritium factory. Muon-catalyzed fusion generates tritium under operation and increases operating efficiency up to an optimum point when the deuterium:tritium ratio reaches about 1:1. Muon-catalyzed fusion can operate as a tritium factory and deliver tritium for material and plasma fusion research.

=== Problems facing practical exploitation ===

Except for some refinements, little has changed since Jackson&#x27;s 1957 assessment of the feasibility of muon-catalyzed fusion other than Vesman&#x27;s 1967 prediction of the hyperfine resonant formation of the muonic (d–μ–t)+ molecular ion which was subsequently experimentally observed. This helped spark renewed interest in the whole field of muon-catalyzed fusion, which remains an active area of research worldwide. However, as Jackson observed in his paper, muon-catalyzed fusion is &quot;unlikely&quot; to provide &quot;useful power production ... unless an energetically cheaper way of producing μ−-mesons can be found.&quot;

One practical problem with the muon-catalyzed fusion process is that muons are unstable, decaying in (in their rest frame). Hence, there needs to be some cheap means of producing muons, and the muons must be arranged to catalyze as many nuclear fusion reactions as possible before decaying.

Another, and in many ways more serious, problem is the &quot;alpha-sticking&quot; problem, which was recognized by Jackson in his 1957 paper. The α-sticking problem is the approximately 1% probability of the muon &quot;sticking&quot; to the alpha particle that results from deuteron-triton nuclear fusion, thereby effectively removing the muon from the muon-catalysis process altogether. Even if muons were absolutely stable, each muon could catalyze, on average, only about 100 d-t fusions before sticking to an alpha particle, which is only about one-fifth the number of muon catalyzed d–t fusions needed for break-even, where as much thermal energy is generated as electrical energy is consumed to produce the muons in the first place, according to Jackson&#x27;s rough estimate.

More recent measurements seem to point to more encouraging values for the α-sticking probability, finding the α-sticking probability to be around 0.3% to 0.5%, which could mean as many as about 200 (even up to 350) muon-catalyzed d–t fusions per muon. Indeed, the team led by Steven E. Jones achieved 150 d–t fusions per muon (average) at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. The results were promising and almost enough to reach theoretical break-even. Unfortunately, these measurements for the number of muon-catalyzed d–t fusions per muon are still not enough to reach industrial break-even. Even with break-even, the conversion efficiency from &quot;thermal&quot; energy to &quot;electrical&quot; energy is only about 40% or so, further limiting viability. The best recent estimates of the &quot;electrical&quot; &quot;energy cost&quot; per muon is about with accelerators that are (coincidentally) about 40% efficient at transforming &quot;electrical&quot; energy from the power grid into acceleration of the deuterons.

As of 2012, no practical method of producing energy through this means has been published, although some discoveries using the Hall effect show promise.

=== Alternative estimation of breakeven ===

According to Gordon Pusch, a physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, various breakeven calculations on muon-catalyzed fusion omit the heat energy the muon beam itself deposits in the target. By taking this factor into account, muon-catalyzed fusion can already exceed breakeven; however, the recirculated power is usually very large compared to power out to the electrical grid (about 3–5 times as large, according to estimates). Despite this rather high recirculated power, the overall cycle efficiency is comparable to conventional fission reactors; however the need for 4–6 MW electrical generating capacity for each megawatt out to the grid probably represents an unacceptably large capital investment. Pusch suggested using Bogdan Maglich&#x27;s &quot;migma&quot; self-colliding beam concept to significantly increase the muon production efficiency, by eliminating target losses, and using tritium nuclei as the driver beam, to optimize the number of negative muons.

In 2021, Kelly, Hart and Rose produced a μCF model whereby the ratio, Q, of thermal energy produced to the kinetic energy of the accelerated deuterons used to create negative pions (and thus negative muons through pion decay) was optimized. In this model, the heat energy of the incoming deuterons as well as that of the particles produced due to the deuteron beam impacting a tungsten target was recaptured to the extent possible, as suggested by Gordon Pusch in the previous paragraph. Additionally, heat energy due to tritium breeding in a lithium-lead shell was recaptured, as suggested by Jändel, Danos and Rafelski in 1988. The best Q value was found to be about 130% assuming that 50% of the muons produced were actually utilized for fusion catalysis. Furthermore, assuming that the accelerator was 18% efficient at transforming electrical energy into deuteron kinetic energy and conversion efficiency of heat energy into electrical energy of 60%, they estimate that, currently, the amount of electrical energy that could be produced by a μCF reactor would be 14% of the electrical energy consumed. In order for this to improve, they suggest that some combination of a) increasing accelerator efficiency and b) increasing the number of fusion reactions per negative muon above the assumed level of 150 would be needed.

== Process ==
To create this effect, a stream of negative muons, most often created by decaying pions, is sent to a block that may be made up of all three hydrogen isotopes (protium, deuterium, and/or tritium), where the block is usually frozen, and the block may be at temperatures of about 3 kelvin (−270 degrees Celsius) or so. The muon may bump the electron from one of the hydrogen isotopes. The muon, 207 times more massive than the electron, effectively shields and reduces the electromagnetic repulsion between two nuclei and draws them much closer into a covalent bond than an electron can. Because the nuclei are so close, the strong nuclear force is able to kick in and bind both nuclei together. They fuse, release the catalytic muon (most of the time), and part of the original mass of both nuclei is released as energetic particles, as with any other type of nuclear fusion. The release of the catalytic muon is critical to continue the reactions. The majority of the muons continue to bond with other hydrogen isotopes and continue fusing nuclei together. However, not all of the muons are recycled: some bond with other debris emitted following the fusion of the nuclei (such as alpha particles and helions), removing the muons from the catalytic process. This gradually chokes off the reactions, as there are fewer and fewer muons with which the nuclei may bond. The number of reactions achieved in the lab can be as high as 150 d–t fusions per muon (average).

== Deuterium–tritium (d–t or dt) ==

In the muon-catalyzed fusion of most interest, a positively charged deuteron (d), a positively charged triton (t), and a muon essentially form a positively charged muonic molecular heavy hydrogen ion (d–μ–t)+. The muon, with a rest mass 207 times greater than the rest mass of an electron, is able to drag the more massive triton and deuteron 207 times closer together to each other
 in the &quot;muonic&quot; (d–μ–t)+ molecular ion than can an electron in the corresponding &quot;electronic&quot; (d–e–t)+ molecular ion. The average separation between the triton and the deuteron in the electronic molecular ion is about one angstrom (100 pm), so the average separation between the triton and the deuteron in the muonic molecular ion is 207 times smaller than that. Due to the strong nuclear force, whenever the triton and the deuteron in the muonic molecular ion happen to get even closer to each other during their periodic vibrational motions, the probability is very greatly enhanced that the positively charged triton and the positively charged deuteron would undergo quantum tunnelling through the repulsive Coulomb barrier that acts to keep them apart. Indeed, the quantum mechanical tunnelling probability depends roughly exponentially on the average separation between the triton and the deuteron, allowing a single muon to catalyze the d–t nuclear fusion in less than about half a picosecond, once the muonic molecular ion is formed.

The formation time of the muonic molecular ion is one of the &quot;rate-limiting steps&quot; in muon-catalyzed fusion that can easily take up to ten thousand or more picoseconds in a liquid molecular deuterium and tritium mixture (D2, DT, T2), for example. Each catalyzing muon thus spends most of its ephemeral existence of 2.2 microseconds, as measured in its rest frame, wandering around looking for suitable deuterons and tritons with which to bind.

Another way of looking at muon-catalyzed fusion is to try to visualize the ground state orbit of a muon around either a deuteron or a triton. Suppose the muon happens to have fallen into an orbit around a deuteron initially, which it has about a 50% chance of doing if there are approximately equal numbers of deuterons and tritons present, forming an electrically neutral &quot;muonic&quot; deuterium atom (d–μ)0 that acts somewhat like a &quot;fat, heavy neutron&quot; due both to its relatively small size (again, 207 times smaller than an electrically neutral &quot;electronic&quot; deuterium atom (d–e)0) and to the very effective &quot;shielding&quot; by the muon of the positive charge of the proton in the deuteron. Even so, the muon still has a much greater chance of being &quot;transferred&quot; to any triton that comes near enough to the muonic deuterium than it does of forming a muonic molecular ion. The electrically neutral muonic tritium atom (t–μ)0 thus formed will act somewhat like an even &quot;fatter, heavier neutron,&quot; but it will most likely hang on to its muon, eventually forming a muonic molecular ion, most likely due to the resonant formation of a hyperfine molecular state within an entire deuterium molecule D2 (d=e2=d), with the muonic molecular ion acting as a &quot;fatter, heavier nucleus&quot; of the &quot;fatter, heavier&quot; neutral &quot;muonic/electronic&quot; deuterium molecule ([d–μ–t]=e2=d), as predicted by Vesman, an Estonian graduate student, in 1967.

Once the muonic molecular ion state is formed, the shielding by the muon of the positive charges of the proton of the triton and the proton of the deuteron from each other allows the triton and the deuteron to tunnel through the Coulomb barrier in time span of order of a nanosecond The muon survives the d–t muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion reaction and remains available (usually) to catalyze further d–t muon-catalyzed nuclear fusions. Each exothermic d–t nuclear fusion releases about 17.6 MeV of energy in the form of a &quot;very fast&quot; neutron having a kinetic energy of about 14.1 MeV and an alpha particle α (a helium-4 nucleus) with a kinetic energy of about 3.5 MeV. An additional 4.8 MeV can be gleaned by having the fast neutrons &quot;moderated&quot; in a suitable &quot;blanket&quot; surrounding the reaction chamber, with the blanket containing lithium-6, whose nuclei, known by some as &quot;lithions,&quot; readily and exothermically absorb thermal neutrons, the lithium-6 being transmuted thereby into an alpha particle and a triton.

== Deuterium–deuterium and other types ==

The first kind of muon–catalyzed fusion to be observed experimentally, by L.W. Alvarez &quot;et al.&quot;, was protium (H or 1H1) and deuterium (D or 1H2) muon-catalyzed fusion. The fusion rate for p–d (or pd) muon-catalyzed fusion has been estimated to be about a million times slower than the fusion rate for d–t muon-catalyzed fusion.

Of more practical interest, deuterium–deuterium muon-catalyzed fusion has been frequently observed and extensively studied experimentally, in large part because deuterium already exists in relative abundance and, like protium, deuterium is not at all radioactive. (Tritium rarely occurs naturally, and is radioactive with a half-life of about 12.5 years.)

The fusion rate for d–d muon-catalyzed fusion has been estimated to be only about 1% of the fusion rate for d–t muon-catalyzed fusion, but this still gives about one d–d nuclear fusion every 10 to 100 picoseconds or so. However, the energy released with every d–d muon-catalyzed fusion reaction is only about 20% or so of the energy released with every d–t muon-catalyzed fusion reaction. Moreover, the catalyzing muon has a probability of sticking to at least one of the d–d muon-catalyzed fusion reaction products that Jackson in this 1957 paper estimated to be at least 10 times greater than the corresponding probability of the catalyzing muon sticking to at least one of the d–t muon-catalyzed fusion reaction products, thereby preventing the muon from catalyzing any more nuclear fusions. Effectively, this means that each muon catalyzing d–d muon-catalyzed fusion reactions in pure deuterium is only able to catalyze about one-tenth of the number of d–t muon-catalyzed fusion reactions that each muon is able to catalyze in a mixture of equal amounts of deuterium and tritium, and each d–d fusion only yields about one-fifth of the yield of each d–t fusion, thereby making the prospects for useful energy release from d–d muon-catalyzed fusion at least 50 times worse than the already dim prospects for useful energy release from d–t muon-catalyzed fusion.

Potential &quot;aneutronic&quot; (or substantially aneutronic) nuclear fusion possibilities, which result in essentially no neutrons among the nuclear fusion products, are almost certainly not very amenable to muon-catalyzed fusion. One such essentially aneutronic nuclear fusion reaction involves a deuteron from deuterium fusing with a helion (He+2) from helium-3, which yields an energetic alpha particle and a much more energetic proton, both positively charged (with a few neutrons coming from inevitable d–d nuclear fusion side reactions). However, one muon with only one negative electric charge is incapable of shielding both positive charges of a helion from the one positive charge of a deuteron. The chances of the requisite &quot;two&quot; muons being present simultaneously are exceptionally remote.

== In culture ==
The term &quot;cold fusion&quot; was coined to refer to muon-catalyzed fusion in a 1956 &quot;New York Times&quot; article about Luis W. Alvarez&#x27;s paper.

In 1957 Theodore Sturgeon wrote a novelette, &quot;The Pod in the Barrier&quot;, in which humanity has ubiquitous cold fusion reactors that work with muons. The reaction is &quot;When hydrogen one and hydrogen two are in the presence of Mu mesons, they fuse into helium three, with an energy yield in electron volts of 5.4 times ten to the fifth power&quot;. Unlike the thermonuclear bomb contained in the Pod (which is used to destroy the Barrier) they can become temporarily disabled by &quot;concentrated disbelief&quot; that muon fusion works.

In Sir Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s third novel in the Space Odyssey series, &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;, muon-catalyzed fusion is the technology that allows mankind to achieve easy interplanetary travel. The main character, Heywood Floyd, compares Luis Alvarez to Lord Rutherford for underestimating the future potential of their discoveries.

<text>HRG Group, Inc., formerly Harbinger Group Inc. and Zapata Corporation, was a holding company based in Rochester, New York, having originated from an oil company started by a group including future U.S. president George H. W. Bush. In 2009, it was renamed the Harbinger Group Inc.

==Early business history==

The company traced its origins to Zapata Petroleum Corporation, founded in 1953 by future U.S. President George H. W. Bush, along with his business partners John Overbey, Hugh Liedtke, Bill Liedtke, and Thomas J. Devine. Overbey was a landman skilled in scouting oil fields and obtaining drilling rights cheaply. Bush and Thomas J. Devine were oil-wildcatting associates. Their joint activities culminated in the establishment of Zapata Oil. The company was named for &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;, a 1952 biographical film starring Marlon Brando as Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. The initial $1 million () investment for Zapata was provided by the Liedtke brothers and their circle of investors, by Bush&#x27;s father Prescott Bush and his
maternal grandfather George Herbert Walker, and their family&#x27;s circle of friends. Hugh Liedtke was named president, Bush was vice president; Overbey soon left.

According to a CIA internal memo dated November 29, 1975, Zapata Petroleum began in 1953 through Bush&#x27;s joint efforts with Thomas J. Devine, a CIA staffer who had resigned his agency position that same year to go into private business, but who continued to work for the CIA under commercial cover. Devine would later accompany Bush to Vietnam in late 1967 as a &quot;cleared and witting commercial asset&quot; of the agency, acted as his informal foreign affairs advisor, and had a close relationship with him through 1975.

In 1954, Zapata Off-Shore Company was formed as a subsidiary of Zapata Oil, with Bush as president of the new company. He raised some startup money from Eugene Meyer, publisher of the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, and his son-in-law, Philip Graham.

Zapata Off-Shore accepted an offer from an inventor, R. G. LeTourneau, for the development of a mobile but secure drilling rig. Zapata advanced him $400,000, which was to be refundable if the completed rig did not function, followed by an additional $550,000 together with 38,000 shares of Zapata Off-Shore common stock when it did.

The U.S. government began to auction off mineral rights to the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and islands off the Central American coast in 1954, and in the late 1950s and early 1960, Zapata Off-Shore concentrated its business in these areas. In 1958, drilling contracts with the seven largest U.S. oil producers included wells north of Isabela, Cuba, near the island Cay Sal.

In 1959 Bush bought control of Zapata Off-Shore, funded with $800,000, splitting Zapata Corporation into two independent companies with the Liedtkes still in control of Zapata Petroleum. Bush moved his offices and family that year from Midland, Texas to Houston for access to the Caribbean through the Houston Ship Channel. But although Zapata Offshore had only a few drilling rigs, Bush set up operations also in the Gulf of Mexico, the Persian Gulf, Trinidad, Borneo, and Medellín, Colombia, and the Kuwait Shell Petroleum Development Company was among the company&#x27;s clients.

In 1960, Jorge Díaz Serrano of Mexico was put in touch with Bush by Dresser Industries. Dresser was owned by Prescott Bush&#x27;s Yale friends Roland and W. Averell Harriman, and had been George H.W. Bush&#x27;s first employer upon his graduation from Yale, giving him his start in both the oil business and the defense contractor business. Serrano and Bush created a new company, Perforaciones Marinas del Golfo, aka Permargo, in conjunction with Edwin Pauley of Pan American Petroleum, with whom Zapata had a previous offshore contract. The deal with Permargo is not mentioned in Zapata&#x27;s annual reports, and SEC records are missing. In 1988, a Bush spokesman claimed that the deal lasted only from March to September 1960. However, Zapata sold the oil-drilling rig Nola I to Pemargo in 1964.

Zapata&#x27;s filing records with the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission are intact for the years 1955–1959, and again from 1967 onwards. However, records for the years 1960–1966 are missing. The commission&#x27;s records officer stated that the records were inadvertently placed in a session file to be destroyed by a federal warehouse, and that a total of 1,000 boxes were pulped in this procedure. The destruction of records occurred either in October 1983 (according to the records officer), or in 1981 shortly after Bush became Vice President of the United States (according to, Wison Carpenter, a record analyst with the commission).

During the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Zapata allowed its oil rigs to be used as listening posts. In 1988, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; said Zapata was &quot;a part time purchasing front for the [Central Intelligence Agency]&quot;.

In 1962, Bush was joined in Zapata Off-Shore by Robert Gow. By 1963, Zapata Off-Shore had four operational oil-drilling rigs—Scorpion (from 1956, the first oil-drilling jackup rig ever built), Vinegaroon (from 1957), Sidewinder, and (in the Persian Gulf) Nola III.

In 1963, Zapata Petroleum merged with South Penn Oil to become Pennzoil.

By 1964, Zapata Off-Shore had a number of subsidiaries, including: Seacat-Zapata Offshore Company (Persian Gulf), Zapata de Mexico, Zapata International Corporation, Zapata Mining Corporation, Zavala Oil Company, Zapata Overseas Corporation, and a 41% share of Amata Gas Corporation.

In 1964, Bush ran for the United States Senate, and lost; he continued as president of Zapata Off-Shore until 1966, when he sold his interest to Doyle Mize and ran for the U.S. House of Representatives.

On September 9, 1965, Hurricane Betsy struck the coast of Louisiana sinking the oil rig &quot;Maverick&quot;. There were no deaths, however, $8 million in Zapata assets were lost. A helicopter flew Bush over the area for several days until debris was located. After evidence was submitted to Lloyd&#x27;s of London for the loss, they paid Zapata for the claim.

In 1966, William Stamps Farish III, age 28, joined the board of Zapata.

==Decline==
Zapata sought to acquire a controlling interest in the United Fruit Company in 1969, but was outbid by Eli M. Black&#x27;s AMK Corp. Robert Gow&#x27;s father, Ralph Gow, was on United Fruit&#x27;s board of directors.

In the 1970s, under chairman and CEO William Flynn, Zapata expanded its business to include subsidiaries in dredging, construction, coal mining, copper mining and fishing.

By the late 1970s, saddled with weak operations, high debt and low return on investment, the company again began undergoing changes in management and direction. Led by John Mackin, who succeeded William Flynn, the company began selling off some of those businesses and refocused on offshore oil and gas exploration and production.

In 1982, chief operating officer Ronald Lassiter assumed the role of CEO, and presided over a decade of loss-making brought on by the collapse of oil prices. In 1982, Zapata Off-shore became Zapata Corporation. Its stock performed poorly. By 1986, Zapata was one of the bad loans that shook the foundations of San Francisco-based Bank of America, with a debt of more than $500 million and a fiscal year loss of $250 million. The company announced several restructurings during those years and managed to stave off bankruptcy, but continued to incur major losses. In 1990 the oil drilling company proposed selling its entire fleet of offshore drilling rigs to focus solely on fishing. The company had not had a profitable quarter in more than five years.

In 1990, Zapata Offshore sold 12 of its drilling rigs to Arethusa Offshore, which a few years later merged with Diamond Offshore. Still struggling with debt by 1993, Zapata signed a deal with Norex America to raise more than $100 million through a loan and stock sale. But financier Malcolm Glazer, owner of the NFL franchise Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Premier League club Manchester United, and at the time owner of 40 percent of Zapata, did not want his holdings diluted and filed a lawsuit to block the deal.

==Glazer era and the birth of Harbinger Group Inc.==
By 1994, the company had come under Glazer&#x27;s control, after a proxy fight. Glazer became chairman of Zapata, replacing Ronald Lassiter, and in 1995 Avram Glazer, son of Malcolm, was named CEO and president of Zapata. De facto headquarters moved from Houston to Rochester, New York. It no longer engaged in exploration, but owned several natural gas service companies. It also produced protein products from the menhaden fish. In subsequent years Zapata sold its energy-related businesses and focused on marine protein.

Between 1998 and 2000, Zapata tried to position itself as an internet media company under the &quot;zap.com&quot; name. In July 1998, Zapata announced its plans to acquire several web sites, including ChatPlanet, TravelPage and DailyStocks.com. The company&#x27;s stock boomed and crashed along with other dot-coms, and on January 24, 2001 the company conducted a 1 for 10 reverse stock split. The venture was cited by many investment journalists as an example of a company jumping on the internet bandwagon without any relevant experience. This period is probably best remembered for Zapata&#x27;s unsolicited (and unsuccessful) takeover bid of the Excite internet portal.

During this period, Zapata also built up a controlling stake in Safety Components International, a manufacturer of air bag fabrics and cushions.

On December 2, 2005, Zapata Corporation Chairman, Avram (&quot;Avi&quot;) Glazer, announced the sale of 4,162,394 shares, 77.3%, of Safety Components International to Wilbur L. Ross Jr. for $51.2 million. The company sold its remaining stock in Omega Proteine on December 1, 2006, leaving it with no active subsidiary.
The Glazer family sold its controlling stock of the Zapata Corporation to Philip Falcone&#x27;s Harbinger Capital in 2009, and the company&#x27;s name was changed to Harbinger Group Inc. with the ticker symbol HRG on the NYSE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harbinger-Group-Inc-Dec-2009-10-Q/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010–2011, Harbinger Capital Partners LLC transferred its 54.4% interest in Spectrum Brands to Harbinger Group Inc. giving the company controlling interest in that company. Also in 2011 Harbinger Group Inc. acquired the insurance company Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. from Old Mutual.

In December 2013, Salus Capital (a unit of Harbinger Group) and Cerberus Capital Management issued a quarter-billion dollars in financing to struggling retailer RadioShack Corporation. Among the terms of this deal were restrictions which prevented RadioShack from closing more than 200 of its 4275 company-owned retail stores a year and limited its ability to refinance, which proved to be a key obstacle leading to that firm&#x27;s February 2015 Chapter 11 bankruptcy as the chain was forced to keep more than a thousand unprofitable stores open. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life, the insurer backed by Harbinger Group, also has a $50 million stake in the RadioShack bankruptcy. An impairment of $105.0, out of the $150 million net exposure, recognized as of March 31, 2015.

On February 26, 2018, the company announced it was merging with Spectrum Brands, which it was a controlling shareholder of. The merger was completed on July 13.

<text>Tara Claire Palmer-Tomkinson (23 December 1971 – 8 February 2017) was an English socialite and television personality. She appeared in several television shows, including the reality programme &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She died from a perforated ulcer on 8 February 2017.

==Early life==
Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire on 23 December 1971, the daughter of Patricia (&quot;née&quot; Dawson) and Charles Palmer-Tomkinson. Her father represented Great Britain as a skier at the 1964 Winter Olympics. She was the younger sister of author Santa Montefiore. Her mother was of Argentine descent. Palmer-Tomkinson was educated at Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset. After she left school, she worked briefly in the City of London for Rothschilds bank.

==Writing career==
In the mid- to late 1990s, a weekly column for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; appeared under her name. However, this was actually ghostwritten by author Wendy Holden based on Palmer-Tomkinson&#x27;s &quot;phoned in description of her activities during the preceding week.&quot; She subsequently similarly contributed to &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot;, &quot;Harpers and Queen&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot;, &quot;InStyle&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; sporadically.

In September 2007, her book &quot;The Naughty Girl&#x27;s Guide to Life&quot;, co-authored with Sharon Marshall, was published by Sphere. It was serialised in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; &quot;Style&quot; magazine.

In October 2010, her first novel, &quot;Inheritance&quot;, was published by Pan Books. This was also ghostwritten.

In 2012, her second novel, &quot;Infidelity&quot;, was published by Pan Books.

==Television appearances==
In 2002, Palmer-Tomkinson made an appearance on the first series of the British television series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, finishing as runner up. She was a contestant on a celebrity Christmas edition of &quot;Blind Date&quot; later that year. She appeared as a Star in a Reasonably Priced Car in &quot;Top Gear&#x27;s&quot; sixth episode of series one. In November 2005, she presented her third behind the scenes series on ITV2 for &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!&quot;. She was also a guest on the first and second series of &quot;&quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;&quot; in 2007 and 2008.

Palmer-Tomkinson&#x27;s presenting credits included &quot;Animals Do the Funniest Things&quot; with Tony Blackburn, the UK selection for the &quot;Junior Eurovision Song Contest&quot; in 2003, &quot;The British Comedy Awards...Party On&quot;, &quot;What Kids Really Think&quot;, &quot;Popworld&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, &quot;Company Magazine Bachelor of the Year&quot;, &quot;Dumb Britain&quot;, &quot;Extreme&quot;, a role as a team captain on &quot;Bognor or Bust&quot; which was hosted by Angus Deayton and work for GMTV, Five, LBC radio, the music channel The Hits and the Living TV programme &quot;Dirty Cows&quot;.

In 2007, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was a contestant on &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; for the BBC. She gave away tickets to see her compete in the show to &quot;ordinary people&quot; who had helped her out (the other contestants generally giving their free tickets to other celebrities). She invited the policeman who found her stolen car, the locksmith who helped when she was locked out of her house and her parents&#x27; local shopkeepers.

==Other work==
Palmer-Tomkinson played the piano, as was demonstrated at events at the Queen Elizabeth Hall with the National Symphony Orchestra, at the Royal Albert Hall, and at The Coliseum during a Leonard Bernstein Tribute. She hosted the Classic FM Gramophone Awards in 2005. She wrote a pop song called &quot;5 Seconds&quot; which she performed on &quot;Loose Women&quot;.

From 2013 to 2014, Palmer-Tomkinson, herself autistic, was patron of Scottish charity Speur Ghlan, which delivers early intervention for young children diagnosed with autism or developmental delays. The appointment garnered media attention for having been facilitated through social media.

==Personal life==

Palmer-Tomkinson&#x27;s family have a close relationship with the British royal family. She attended the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles as well as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.

In 2004, Paul Harvey&#x27;s painting of Palmer-Tomkinson was exhibited in &quot;The Stuckists Punk Victorian&quot; show at the Walker Art Gallery for the Liverpool Biennial.

===Drug addiction===
Palmer-Tomkinson was addicted to cocaine in her early career. In 1999, she appeared on &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot;, slurring her words and forgetting the host&#x27;s name. In 2006, she received extensive publicity after her nasal septum collapsed due to her cocaine addiction. Pictures were printed in several British tabloids. She underwent cosmetic surgery to have it rebuilt.

===Arrest===
On 22 December 2014, Palmer-Tomkinson was arrested at Heathrow Airport. This followed her reaction to being refused access to a first-class lounge. Following her arrest, she said that a panic attack triggered her behaviour. She stated: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t drunk, there was no disorderly. I was cautioned, I saw a doctor, they were nice to me&quot;, before flying to Switzerland to celebrate her 43rd birthday.

===Illness and death===
In January 2016, Palmer-Tomkinson was diagnosed with a prolactinoma, a benign tumour (adenoma) of the pituitary gland, and announced her illness publicly in November of that year. Prolactinomas are not malignant, and the treatment was successful. She also had ANCA Associated Vasculitis. On 8 February 2017, Palmer-Tomkinson was found dead at her home in London. The death was treated as unexplained but not suspicious. Her sister later told the media that the cause of death was a perforated ulcer and peritonitis.
