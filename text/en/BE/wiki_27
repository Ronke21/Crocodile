<text>Homo ergaster is an extinct species or subspecies of archaic humans who lived in Africa in the Early Pleistocene. Whether &quot;H. ergaster&quot; constitutes a species of its own or should be subsumed into &quot;H. erectus&quot; is an ongoing and unresolved dispute within palaeoanthropology. Proponents of synonymisation typically designate &quot;H. ergaster&quot; as &quot;African &quot;Homo erectus&quot; or &quot;Homo erectus ergaster&quot;&quot;. The name &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; roughly translates to &quot;working man&quot;, a reference to the more advanced tools used by the species in comparison to those of their ancestors. The fossil range of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; mainly covers the period of 1.7 to 1.4 million years ago, though a broader time range is possible. Though fossils are known from across East and Southern Africa, most &quot;H. ergaster&quot; fossils have been found along the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya. There are later African fossils, some younger than 1 million years ago, that indicate long-term anatomical continuity, though it is unclear if they can be formally regarded as &quot;H. ergaster&quot; specimens. As a chronospecies, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; may have persisted to as late as 600,000 years ago, when new lineages of &quot;Homo&quot; arose in Africa.

Those who believe &quot;H. ergaster&quot; should be subsumed into &quot;H. erectus&quot; consider there to be too little difference between the two to separate them into distinct species. Proponents of keeping the two species as distinct cite morphological differences between the African fossils and &quot;H. erectus&quot; fossils from Asia, as well as early &quot;Homo&quot; evolution being more complex than what is implied by subsuming species such as &quot;H. ergaster&quot; into &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Additionally, morphological differences between the specimens commonly seen as constituting &quot;H. ergaster&quot; might suggest that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; itself does not represent a cohesive species. Regardless of their most correct classification, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; exhibit primitive versions of traits later expressed in &quot;H. erectus&quot; and are thus likely the direct ancestors of later &quot;H. erectus&quot; populations in Asia. Additionally, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; is likely ancestral to later hominins in Europe and Africa, such as modern humans and Neanderthals.

Several features distinguish &quot;H. ergaster&quot; from australopithecines as well as earlier and more basal species of &quot;Homo&quot;, such as &quot;H. habilis&quot;. Among these features are their larger body mass, relatively long legs, obligate bipedalism, relatively small jaws and teeth (indicating a major change in diet) as well as body proportions and inferred lifestyles more similar to modern humans than to earlier and contemporary hominins. With these features in mind, some researchers view &quot;H. ergaster&quot; as being the earliest true representative of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;.

&quot;H. ergaster&quot; lived on the savannah in Africa, a unique environment with challenges that would have resulted in the need for many new and distinct behaviours. Earlier &quot;Homo&quot; probably used counter-attack tactics, like modern primates, to keep predators away. By the time of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, this behaviour had probably resulted in the development of true hunter-gatherer behaviour, a first among primates. &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was an apex predator. Further behaviours that might first have arisen in &quot;H. ergaster&quot; include male-female divisions of foraging and true monogamous pair bonds. &quot;H. ergaster&quot; also marks the appearance of more advanced tools of the Acheulean industry, including the earliest known hand axes. Though undisputed evidence is missing, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; might also have been the earliest hominin to master control of fire.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Research history===

The systematics and taxonomy of &quot;Homo&quot; in the Early to Middle Pleistocene is one of the most disputed areas of palaeoanthropology. In early palaeoanthropology and well into the twentieth century, it was generally assumed that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; was the end result of gradual modifications within a single lineage of hominin evolution. As the perceived transitional form between early hominins and modern humans, &quot;H. erectus&quot;, originally assigned to contain archaic human fossils in Asia, came to encompass a wide range of fossils covering a large span of time (almost the entire temporal range of &quot;Homo&quot;). Since the late twentieth century, the diversity within &quot;H. erectus&quot; has led some to question what exactly defines the species and what it should encompass. Some researchers, such as palaeoanthropologist Ian Tattersall in 2013, have questioned &quot;H. erectus&quot; since it contains an &quot;unwieldly&quot; number of fossils with &quot;substantially differing morphologies&quot;.

In the 1970s, palaeoanthropologists Richard Leakey and Alan Walker described a series of hominin fossils from Kenyan fossil localities on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana. The most notable finds were two partial skulls; KNM ER 3733 and KNM ER 3883, found at Koobi Fora. Leakey and Walker assigned these skulls to &quot;H. erectus&quot;, noting that their brain volumes (848 and 803 cc respectively) compared well to the far younger type specimen of &quot;H. erectus&quot; (950 cc). Another significant fossil was a fossil mandible recovered at Ileret and described by Leakey with the designation KNM ER 992 in 1972 as &quot;&quot;Homo&quot; of indeterminate species&quot;.

In 1975, palaeoanthropologists Colin Groves and Vratislav Mazák designated KNM ER 992 as the holotype specimen of a distinct species, which they dubbed &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;. The name (&quot;ergaster&quot; being derived from the Ancient Greek ἐργαστήρ, &quot;ergastḗr&quot;, &#x27;workman&#x27;) roughly translates to &quot;working man&quot; or &quot;workman&quot;. Groves and Mazák also included many of the Koobi Fora fossils, such as KNM ER 803 (a partial skeleton and some isolated teeth) in their designation of the species, but did not provide any comparison with the Asian fossil record of &quot;H. erectus&quot; in their diagnosis, inadvertently causing some of the later taxonomic confusion in regards to the species.

A nearly complete fossil, interpreted as a young male (though the sex is actually undetermined), was discovered at the western shore of Lake Turkana in 1984 by Kenyan archaeologist Kamoya Kimeu. The fossils were described by Leakey and Walker, alongside paleoanthropologists Frank Brown and John Harris, in 1985 as KNM-WT 15000 (nicknamed &quot;Turkana Boy&quot;). They interpreted the fossil, consisting of a nearly complete skeleton, as representing &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Turkana Boy was the first discovered comprehensively preserved specimen of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;/&quot;erectus&quot; found and constitutes an important fossil in establishing the differences and similarities between early &quot;Homo&quot; and modern humans. Turkana Boy was placed in &quot;H. ergaster&quot; by paleoanthropologist Bernard Wood in 1992, and is today, alongside other fossils in Africa previously designated as &quot;H. erectus&quot;, commonly seen as a representative of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; by those who support &quot;H. ergaster&quot; as a distinct species.

=== Classification ===
&quot;H. ergaster&quot; is easily distinguished from earlier and more basal species of &quot;Homo&quot;, notably &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, by a number of features that align them, and their inferred lifestyle, more closely to modern humans than to earlier and contemporary hominins. As compared to their relatives, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; had body proportions more similar to later members of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, notably relatively long legs which would have made them obligately bipedal. The teeth and jaws of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; are also relatively smaller than those of &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, indicating a major change in diet. In 1999, palaeoanthropologists Bernard Wood and Mark Collard argued that the conventional criteria for assigning species to the genus &quot;Homo&quot; were flawed and that early and basal species, such as &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, might appropriately be reclassified as ancestral australopithecines. In their view, the true earliest representative of &quot;Homo&quot; was &quot;H. ergaster&quot;.
Since its description as a separate species in 1975, the classification of the fossils referred to &quot;H. ergaster&quot; has been in dispute. &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was immediately dismissed by Leakey and Walker and many influential researchers, such as palaeoanthropologist G. Philip Rightmire, who wrote an extensive treatise on &quot;H. erectus&quot; in 1990, continued to prefer a more inclusive and comprehensive &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Overall, there is no doubt that the group of fossils composing &quot;H. erectus&quot; and &quot;H. ergaster&quot; represent the fossils of a more or less cohesive subset of closely related archaic humans. The question is instead whether these fossils represent a radiation of different species or the radiation of a single, highly variable and diverse, species over the course of almost two million years. This long-running debate remains unresolved, with researchers typically using the terms &quot;H. erectus&quot; s.s. (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) to refer to &quot;H. erectus&quot; fossils in Asia and the term &quot;H. erectus&quot; s.l. (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) to refer to fossils of other species that may or may not be included in &quot;H. erectus&quot;, such as &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, &quot;H. antecessor&quot; and &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;.

For obvious reasons, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; shares many features with &quot;H. erectus&quot;, such as large forward-projecting jaws, large brow ridges and a receding forehead. Many of the features of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; are clearly more primitive versions of features later expressed in &quot;H. erectus&quot;, which somewhat obscures the differences between the two. There are subtle, potentially significant, differences between the East African and East Asian fossils. Among these are the somewhat higher-domed and thinner-walled skulls of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, and the even more massive brow ridges and faces of Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot;.

The question is made more difficult since it regards how much intraspecific variation can be exhibited in a single species before it needs to be split into more, a question that in and of itself does not have a clear-cut answer. A 2008 analysis by anthropologist Karen L. Baab, examining fossils of various &quot;H. erectus&quot; subspecies, and including fossils attributed to &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, found that the intraspecific variation within &quot;H. erectus&quot; was greater than expected for a single species when compared to modern humans and chimpanzees, but fell well within the variation expected for a species when compared to gorillas, and even well within the range expected for a single subspecies when compared to orangutans (though this is partly due to the great sexual dimorphism exhibited in gorillas and orangutans). Baab concluded that &quot;H. erectus&quot; s.l. was either a single but variable species, several subspecies divided by time and geography or several geographically dispersed but closely related species. In 2015, paleoanthropologists David Strait, Frederick Grine and John Fleagle listed &quot;H. ergaster&quot; as one of the seven &quot;widely recognized&quot; species of &quot;Homo&quot;, alongside &quot;H. habilis&quot;, &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, &quot;H. erectus&quot;, &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, noting that other species, such as &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; and &quot;H. antecessor&quot;, were less widely recognised or more poorly known.

==== Variation in the fossil material====
Comparing various African fossils attributed to &quot;H. erectus&quot; or &quot;H. ergaster&quot; to Asian fossils, notably the type specimen of &quot;H. erectus&quot;, in 2013, Ian Tattersall concluded that referring to the African material as &quot;H. ergaster&quot; rather than &quot;African &quot;H. erectus&quot;&quot; was a &quot;considerable improvement&quot; as there were many autapomorphies distinguishing the material of the two continents from one another. Tattersall believes it to be appropriate to use the designation &quot;H. erectus&quot; only for eastern Asian fossils, disregarding its previous use as the name for an adaptive grade of human fossils from throughout Africa and Eurasia. Though Tattersall concluded that the &quot;H. ergaster&quot; material represents the fossils of a single clade of &quot;Homo&quot;, he also found there to be considerable diversity within this clade; the KNM ER 992 mandible accorded well with other fossil mandibles from the region, such as OH 22 from Olduvai and KNM ER 3724 from Koobi Fora, but did not necessarily match with cranial material, such as KNM ER 3733 and KNM ER 3883 (since neither preserves the jaw), nor with the mandible preserved in Turkana Boy, which has markedly different dentition.

The most &quot;iconic&quot; fossil of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; is the KNM ER 3733 skull, which is sharply distinguished from Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; by a number of characteristics, including that the brow ridges project forward as well as upward and arc separately over each orbit and the braincase being quite tall compared to its width, with its side walls curving. KNM ER 3733 can be distinguished from KNM ER 3883 by a number of features as well, notably in that the margins of KNM ER 3883&#x27;s brow ridges are very thickened and protrude outwards but slightly downwards rather than upwards. Both skulls can be distinguished from the skull of Turkana Boy, which possesses only slightly substantial thickenings of the superior orbital margins, lacking the more vertical thickening of KNM ER 3883 and the aggressive protrusion of KNM ER 3733. In addition to this, the facial structure of Turkana Boy is narrower and longer than that of the other skulls, with a higher nasal aperture and likely a flatter profile of the upper face. It is possible that these differences can be accounted for through Turkana Boy being a subadult, 7 to 12 years old. Furthermore, KNM ER 3733 is presumed to have been the skull of a female (whereas Turkana Boy is traditionally interpreted as male), which means that sexual dimorphism may account for some of the differences.

The differences between Turkana Boy&#x27;s skull and KNM ER 3733 and KNM ER 3883, as well as the differences in dentition between Turkana Boy and KNM ER 992 have been interpreted by some, such as paleoanthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz, as suggesting that Turkana Boy and the rest of the &quot;H. ergaster&quot; material does not represent the same taxon. Schwartz also noted none of the fossils seemed to represent &quot;H. erectus&quot; either, which he believed was in need of significant revision. In 2000, French palaeoanthropologist Valéry Zeitoun suggested that KNM ER 3733 and KNM ER 3883 should be referred to two separate species, which she dubbed &quot;H. kenyaensis&quot; (type specimen KNM ER 3733) and &quot;H. okotensis&quot; (type specimen KNM ER 3883), but these designations have found little acceptance.

== Evolutionary history ==

=== Evolution and temporal range ===

Although frequently assumed to have originated in East Africa, the origins of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; are obscured by the fact that the species marks a radical departure from earlier species of &quot;Homo&quot; and &quot;Australopithecus&quot; in its long limbs, height and modern body proportions. Though a large number of Pleistocene tools have been found in East Africa, it can not be fully ascertained that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; originated there without further fossil discoveries. It is assumed that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; evolved from earlier species of &quot;Homo&quot;, probably &quot;H. habilis&quot;. Though populations of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; outside of Africa have been inferred based on the geographical distribution of their descendants and tools matching those in East Africa, fossils of the species are mainly from East Africa in the time range of 1.8 to 1.7 million years ago. Most fossils have been recovered from around the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya.

The oldest known specimen of &quot;H. erectus&quot; s.l. in Africa (i.e. &quot;H. ergaster&quot;) is DNH 134, a skull recovered in the Drimolen Palaeocave System in South Africa, dated to 2.04 to 1.95 million years ago. The skull is also the oldest known &quot;H. erectus&quot; s.l. specimen overall, showing clear similarities to KNM ER 3733, and demonstrates that early &quot;H. ergaster&quot; coexisted with other hominins such as &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot; and &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot;.

There are also younger specimens of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;; notably, Turkana Boy is dated to about 1.56 million years ago. A handful of even younger African skulls make the case for long-term anatomical continuity, though it is unclear if they can appropriately be formally regarded as &quot;H. ergaster&quot; specimens; the &quot;Olduvai Hominid 9&quot; skull from Olduvai Gorge is dated to about 1.2 to 1.1 million years ago and there are also skulls from Buia (near the coast of Eritrea, dated to ~1 million years old), the Bouri Formation in Ethiopia (dated to between 1 million and 780,000 years old) and a fragmentary skull from Olorgesailie in Kenya (dated to between 970,000 and 900,000 years ago). The Olduvai skull is similar to Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; in its massive brow ridge, but the others only show minor differences to earlier &quot;H. ergaster&quot; skulls.

The &quot;H. erectus&quot; in Asia, as well as later hominins in Europe (i. e. &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; and &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot;) and Africa (&quot;H. sapiens&quot;) are all probably lineages descended from &quot;H. ergaster.&quot; Because &quot;H. ergaster&quot; is thought to have been ancestral to these later &quot;Homo&quot;, it might have persisted in Africa until around 600,000 years ago, when brain size increased rapidly and &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; emerged.

=== Expansion out of Africa ===
Traditionally, &quot;H. erectus&quot; was seen as the hominin that first left Africa to colonise Europe and Asia. If &quot;H. ergaster&quot; is distinct from &quot;H. erectus&quot;, this role would apply to &quot;H. ergaster&quot; instead. Very little concrete information is known on when and which &quot;Homo&quot; first appeared in Europe and Asia, since Early Pleistocene fossil hominins are scarce on both continents, and that it would have been &quot;H. ergaster&quot; (or &quot;early &quot;H. erectus&quot;&quot;) that expanded, as well as the particular manner in which they did, remains conjecture. The presence of &quot;H. erectus&quot; fossils in East Asia means that a human species, most likely &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, had left Africa before 1 million years ago, the assumption historically having been that they first migrated out of Africa around 1.9 to 1.7 million years ago. Discoveries in Georgia and China push the latest possible date further back, before 2 million years ago, also casting doubt on the idea that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was the first hominin to leave Africa.

The main reason for leaving Africa is likely to have been an increasing population periodically outgrowing their resource base, with splintering groups moving to establishing themselves in neighboring, empty territories over time. The physiology and improved technology of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; might have allowed them to travel to and colonise territories that no one had ever occupied before. It is unclear if &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was truly uniquely capable of expanding outside Africa; australopithecines had likely colonised savannah grasslands throughout Africa by 3 million years ago and there are no clear reasons as to why they would not have been able to expand into the grasslands of Asia before &quot;H. ergaster&quot;.

The general assumption is that hominins migrated out of the continent either across the southern end of the Red Sea or along the Nile Valley, but there are no fossil hominins known from either region in the Early Pleistocene. The earliest &quot;Homo&quot; fossils outside Africa are the Dmanisi skulls from Georgia (dated to 1.77–1.85 million years old, representing either early &quot;H. ergaster&quot; or a new taxon, &quot;H. georgicus&quot;), three incisors from Ubeidiya in Israel (about 1.4 to 1 million years old) and the fossils of Java Man (&quot;H. erectus erectus&quot;, more than five thousand miles away). The dating of key Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot; specimens (including Java Man) is not entirely certain, but they are all likely to be 1.5 million years old or younger. Ubeidiya is also the oldest firmly confirmed site of Acheulean tools (one of the tool industries associated with &quot;H. ergaster&quot;) outside Africa, the tools recovered there closely resembling older tools discovered in East Africa.

The earliest fossil evidence of &quot;Homo&quot; in Asia are the aforementioned Dmanisi skulls, which share many traits with &quot;H. ergaster&quot; in Africa, suggesting that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; might have expanded out of Africa as early as 1.7–1.9 million years ago. In addition to &quot;H. ergaster&quot;-like traits, the Dmanisi skulls possess a wide assortment of other traits, some of which are similar to traits in earlier hominins such as &quot;H. habilis&quot;, and the site notably lacks preserved hand axes (otherwise characteristic of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;), which means that hominins might have spread out of Africa even earlier than &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. The skull D2700 (Dmanisi skull 3) in particular resembles &quot;H. habilis&quot; in the small volume of its braincase (600 cc), the form of the middle and upper face and the lack of an external nose. The mixture of skulls at Dmanisi suggests that the definition of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; (or &quot;H. erectus&quot;) might most appropriately be expanded to contain fossils that would otherwise be assigned to &quot;H. habilis&quot; or that two separate species of archaic humans left Africa early on. In addition to the Dmanisi fossils, stone tools manufactured by hominins have been discovered on the Loess Plateau in China and dated to 2.12 million years old, meaning that hominins must have left Africa before that time.

An alternative hypothesis historically has been that &quot;Homo&quot; evolved in Asia from earlier ancestors that had migrated there from Africa, and then expanded back into Europe, where it gave rise to &quot;H. sapiens&quot;. This view was notably held by Eugène Dubois, who first described &quot;H. erectus&quot; fossils in the 19th century and considered the fossils of Java Man, at the time undeniably the earliest known hominin fossils, as proof of the hypothesis. Though the discovery of australopithecines and earlier &quot;Homo&quot; in Africa meant that &quot;Homo&quot; itself did not originate in Asia, the idea that &quot;H. erectus&quot; (or &quot;H. ergaster&quot;) in particular did, and then expanded back into Africa, has occasionally resurfaced. Various fossil discoveries have been used to support it through the years, including a massive set of jaws from Indonesia which were perceived to be similar to those of australopithecines and dubbed &quot;Meganthropus&quot; (now believed to be an unrelated hominid ape). The discovery of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; in 2003, which preserved primitive foot and wrist anatomy reminiscent of that of &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;Australopithecus&quot; again led to suggestions of pre-&quot;erectus&quot; hominins in Asia, though there are no known comparable foot or wrist bones from &quot;H. erectus&quot; which makes comparisons impossible. The idea that &quot;H. ergaster&quot;/&quot;H. erectus&quot; first evolved in Asia before expanding back into Africa was substantially weakened by the dating of the DNH 134 skull as approximately 2 million years old, predating all other known &quot;H. ergaster&quot;/&quot;H. erectus&quot; fossils.

== Anatomy ==

=== Build and appearance ===

The only well-preserved post-cranial remains of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; come from the Turkana Boy fossil. Unlike the australopithecines, Turkana Boy&#x27;s arms were not longer relative to their legs than the arms of living people and the cone-shaped torso of their ancestors had evolved into a more barrel-shaped chest over narrow hips, another similarity to modern humans. The tibia (shin bone) of Turkana Boy is relatively longer than the same bone in modern humans, potentially meaning that there was more bend in the knee when walking. The slim and long build of Turkana Boy may be explained by &quot;H. ergaster&quot; living in hot and arid, seasonal environments. Through thinning of the body, body volume decreases faster than skin area and greater skin area means more effective heat dissipation.

&quot;H. ergaster&quot; individuals were significantly taller than their ancestors. Whereas Lucy, a famous &quot;Australopithecus&quot; fossil, would only have been about tall at her death, Turkana Boy was about tall and would probably have reached or more if he had survived to adulthood. Adult &quot;H. ergaster&quot; are believed to have ranged in size from about tall.

Because of being adapted to a hot and arid climate, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; might also have been the earliest human species to have nearly hairless and naked skin. If instead &quot;H. ergaster&quot; had an ape-like covering of body hair, sweating (the primary means through which modern humans prevent their brains and bodies from overheating) would not have been as efficient. Though sweating is the generally accepted explanation for hairlessness, other proposed explanations include a reduction of parasite load and sexual selection. It is doubtful if australopithecines and earlier &quot;Homo&quot; were sufficiently mobile to make hair loss an advantageous trait, whereas &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was clearly adapted for long-distance travel and noted for inhabiting lower altitudes (and open, hot savannah environments) than their ancestors. Australopithecines typically inhabited colder and higher altitudes 1,000–1,600 m (3,300–5,200 ft), where nighttime temperatures would have gotten significantly colder and insulating body hair may have been required.

Alternatively and despite this, the loss of body hair could have occurred significantly earlier than &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. Though skin impressions are unknown in any extinct hominin, it is possible that human ancestors were already losing their body hair around 3 million years ago. Human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas about 3 million years ago, and speciation of human from gorilla pubic lice was potentially only possible because human ancestors had lost most of their body hair by this early date. It is also possible that the loss of body hair occurred at a significantly later date. Genetic analysis suggests that high activity in the melanocortin 1 receptor, which produces dark skin, dates back to about 1.2 million years ago. This could indicate the evolution of hairlessness around this time, as a lack of body hair would have left the skin exposed to harmful UV radiation.

=== Skull and face ===

Differences to modern humans would have been readily apparent in the face and skull of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. Turkana Boy&#x27;s brain was almost fully grown at the time of his death, but its volume (at 880 cc) was only about 130 cc greater than the maximum found in &quot;H. habilis&quot;, about 500 cc below the average of modern humans. The 130 cc increase from &quot;H. habilis&quot; becomes much less significant than what could be presumed when the larger body size of Turkana Boy and &quot;H. ergaster&quot; is considered. With all &quot;H. ergaster&quot; skulls considered, the brain volume of the species mostly varied between 600 and 910 cc, with some small examples only having a volume of 508–580 cc. Since their brain was smaller than that of modern humans, the skull of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; immediately narrowed behind the eye sockets (post-orbital constriction).
The brain case was long and low, and Turkana Boy&#x27;s forehead was flat and receding, merging at an angle with the brow ridge above their eyes. A noticeable difference between Turkana Boy and the australopithecines and &quot;H. habilis&quot; would have been their nose, which would have been similar to that of modern humans in projecting forwards and having nostrils oriented downwards. This external nose may have also been an adaptation towards a warmer climate, since the noses of modern humans are usually cooler than their central bodies, condensing moisture that would otherwise have been exhaled and lost during periods of increased activity. The face of Turkana Boy would have been longer from top to bottom than that of modern humans, with the jaws projecting farther outwards (prognathism). Though the jaws and teeth were smaller than those of the average australopithecine and &quot;H. habilis&quot;, they were still significantly larger than those of modern humans. Since the jaw slanted sharply backwards, it is probable that they were chinless.

The overall structure of Turkana Boy&#x27;s skull and face is also reflected in other &quot;H. ergaster&quot; skulls, which combine large and outwardly projecting faces with brow ridges, receding foreheads, large teeth and projecting nasal bones. Though Turkana Boy would have been no more than 12 years old when he died, their stature is more similar to that of a modern 15-year-old and the brain is comparable to that of a modern 1-year-old. By modern standards, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; would thus have been cognitively limited, though the invention of new tools prove that they were more intelligent than their predecessors.

=== Body mass and sexual dimorphism ===

&quot;H. ergaster&quot; possessed a significantly larger body mass in comparison to earlier hominins such as early &quot;Homo&quot;, &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot;. Whereas australopithecines typically ranged in weight from 29–48 kg (64–106 lbs), &quot;H. ergaster&quot; typically ranged in weight from 52–63 kg (115–139 lbs). It is possible that the increased body size was the result of life in an open savannah environment, where increased size gives the ability to exploit broader diets in larger foraging areas, increases mobility and also gives the ability to hunt larger prey. The increased body mass also means that parents would have been able to carry their children to an older age and larger mass.

Though reduced sexual dimorphism has often been cited historically as one of the radical differences between &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and earlier &quot;Homo&quot; and australopithecines, it is unclear whether australopithecines were significantly more sexually diamorphic than &quot;H. ergaster&quot; or modern humans. Skeletal evidence suggests that sexes in &quot;H. ergaster&quot; differed no more in size than sexes in modern humans do, but a 2003 study by palaeoanthropologists Philip L. Reno, Richard S. Meindl, Melanie A. McCollum and C. Owen Lovejoy suggested that the same was also true for the significantly earlier &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;. Sexual dimorphism is difficult to measure in extinct species since the sex of fossils is usually not determinable. Historically, scientists have typically measured differences between the extreme ends (in terms of size and morphology) of the fossil material attributed to a species and assumed that the resulting ratio applies to the mean difference between male and female individuals.

=== Growth and development ===
The dimensions of a 1.8 million years old adult female &quot;H. ergaster&quot; pelvis from Gona, Ethiopia suggests that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; would have been capable of birthing children with a maximum prenatal (pre-birth) brain size of 315 cc, about 30–50 % of adult brain size. This value falls intermediately between that of chimpanzees (~40 %) and modern humans (28%). Further conclusions about the growth and development in early &quot;Homo&quot; can be drawn from the Mojokerto child, a ~1.4–1.5 million year old ~1-year old Asian &quot;H. erectus&quot;, which had a brain at about 72–84% the size of an adult &quot;H. erectus&quot; brain, which suggests a brain growth trajectory more similar to that of other great apes than of modern humans. Both the Gona pelvis and the Mojokerto child suggest that the prenatal growth of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was similar to that of modern humans but that the postnatal (post-birth) growth and development was intermediate between that of chimpanzees and modern humans. The faster development rate suggests that altriciality (an extended childhood and a long period of dependency on your parents) evolved at a later stage in human evolution, possibly in the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. The faster development rate might also indicate that the expected lifespan of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and &quot;H. erectus&quot; was lower than that of later and modern humans.

=== Diet and energetics ===

It is frequently assumed that the larger body and brain size of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, compared to its ancestors, would have brought with it increased dietary and energy needs. In 2002, palaeoanthropologists Leslie C. Aiello and Jonathan C. K. Wells stated that the average resting metabolic requirements of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; would have been 39% higher than those of &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;, 30% higher in males and 54% higher in females. However, the torso proportions of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; implies a relatively small gut, which means that energy needs might not necessarily have been higher in &quot;H. ergaster&quot; than in earlier hominins. This is because the earlier ape (and australopithecine) gut was large and energy-expensive since it needed to synthesize fat through fermenting plant matter, whereas &quot;H. ergaster&quot; likely ate significantly more animal fat than their predecessors. This would have allowed more energy to be diverted to brain growth, increasing brain size while maintaining the energy requirements of earlier species.

If they had increased energy requirements, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; would have needed to eat either vastly more food than australopithecines, or would have needed to eat food of superior quality. If they ate the same type of foods as the australopithecines, feeding time would then have had to be dramatically increased in proportion to the extra calories required, reducing the time &quot;H. ergaster&quot; could use for resting, socialising and travelling. Though this would have been possible, it is considered unlikely, especially since the jaws and teeth of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; are reduced in size compared to those of the australopithecines, suggesting a shift in diet away from fibrous and difficult-to-chew foods. Regardless of energy needs, the small gut of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; also suggests a more easily digested diet composed of food of higher quality.

It is likely that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; consumed meat in higher proportions than the earlier australopithecines. Meat was probably acquired through a combination of ambushes, active hunting and confrontational scavenging. &quot;H. ergaster&quot; must not only have possessed the ability of endurance running, but must also have been able to defend themselves and the carcasses of their prey from the variety of contemporary African predators. It is possible that a drop in African carnivoran species variety around 1.5 million years ago can be ascribed to competition with opportunistic and carnivorous hominins.

On its own, meat might not have been able to fully sustain &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. Modern humans can not sufficiently metabolize protein to meet more than 50% of their energy needs and modern humans who heavily rely on animal-based products in their diet mostly rely on fat to sustain the rest of their energy requirements. Multiple reasons make a fully meat-based diet in &quot;H. ergaster&quot; unlikely, the most prominent being that African ungulates (the primary prey available) are relatively low in fat and that high meat diets demand increased intake of water, which would have been difficult in an open and hot environment. Modern African hunter-gatherers who rely heavily on meat, such as the Hadza and San peoples, also use cultural means to recover the maximum amount of fat from the carcasses of their prey, a method that would not have been available to &quot;H. ergaster&quot;.

&quot;H. ergaster&quot; would thus likely have consumed large quantities of meat, vastly more than their ancestors, but would also have had to make use of a variety of other food sources, such as seeds, honey, nuts, invertebrates, nutritious tubers, bulbs and other underground plant storage organs. The relatively small chewing capacity of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, in comparison to its larger-jawed ancestors, means that the meat and high quality plant food consumed would likely have required the use of tools to process before eating.

=== Social structure and dynamics ===

&quot;H. ergaster&quot; lived on the African savannah, which during the Pleistocene was home to a considerably more formidable community of carnivorans than the present savannah. Hominins could probably only have adapted to life on the savannah if effective anti-predator defense behaviours had already evolved. Defense against predators would likely have come through &quot;H. ergaster&quot; living in large groups, possessing stone (and presumably wooden) tools and effective counter-attack behaviour having been established. In modern primates that spend significant amounts of time on the savannah, such as chimpanzees and savannah baboons, individuals form large, multi-male, groups wherein multiple males can effectively work together to fend off and counter-attack predators, occasionally with the use of stones or sticks, and protect the rest of the group. It is possible that similar behaviour was exhibited in early &quot;Homo&quot;. Based on the male-bonded systems within bonobos and chimpanzees, and the tendency towards male bonding in modern foragers, groups of early &quot;Homo&quot; might have been male-bonded as well. Because of the scarcity of fossil material, group size in early &quot;Homo&quot; cannot be determined with any certainty. Groups were probably large, it is possible groups were above the upper range of known group sizes among chimpanzees and baboons ( 100 individuals or more). In 1993, palaeoanthropologists Leslie C. Aiello and R. I. M. Dunbar estimated that the group size of &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, based on neocortex size (as there is a known relationship between neocortex size and group size in modern non-human primates), would have ranged from about 70–85 individuals. With the additional factor of bipedalism, which is energetically cheaper than quadrupedalism, the maximum ecologically tolerable group size may have been even larger. Aiello&#x27;s and Dunbar&#x27;s group size estimate in regards to &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was 91–116 individuals.

Social and counter-attack behaviour of earlier &quot;Homo&quot; probably carried over into &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, where they are likely to have developed even further. &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was probably the first primate to move into the niche of social carnivore (i. e. hunter-gatherer). Such behaviour would probably have been the result of counter-attacks in the context of competition over nutritious food with other carnivores and would probably have evolved from something akin to the opportunistic hunting sometimes exhibited by chimpanzees. The switch to predation in groups might have triggered a cascade of evolutionary changes which changed the course of human evolution. Cooperative behaviours such as opportunistic hunting in groups, predator defense and confrontational scavenging would have been critical for survival which means that a fundamental transition in psychology gradually transpired. With the typical &quot;competitive cooperation&quot; behaviour exhibited by most primates no longer being favored through natural selection and social tendencies taking its place, hunting, and other activities, would have become true collaborative efforts. Because counter-attack behaviour is typically exhibited in males of modern primates, social hunting in archaic humans is believed to have been a primarily male activity. Females likely conducted other types of foraging, gathering food which did not require hunting (i.e. fruits, nuts, eggs etc.).

With hunting being a social activity, individuals probably shared the meat with one another, which would have strengthened the bonds both between the hunters themselves and between the hunters and the rest of the &quot;H. ergaster&quot; group. Females likely shared what they had foraged with the rest of the group as well. This development could have led to the development of male-female friendships into opportunistic monogamous pair bonds. Since sexual selection from females probably favored males that could hunt, the emerging social behaviour resulting from these new behaviours would have been carried over and amplified through the generations.

The only direct evidence of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; group composition comes from a series of sites outside of Ileret in Kenya, where 97 footprints made around 1.5 million years ago by a group of at least 20 individuals have been preserved. Based on the size of the footprints, one of the trackways appears to have been a group entirely composed of males, possibly a specialised task group, such as a border patrol or a hunting or foraging party. If this assessment is correct, this would further suggest a male-female division of responsibilities. In modern hunter-gatherer societies who target large prey items, male parties are typically dispatched to bring down these high-risk animals, and, due to the low success rate, female parties tend to focus on more predictable foods.

=== Technology ===

==== Tool production ====
Early &quot;H. ergaster&quot; inherited the Oldowan culture of tools from australopithecines and earlier &quot;Homo&quot;, though quickly learnt to strike much larger stone flakes than their predecessors and contemporaries. By 1.65 million years ago, &quot;H. ergaster&quot; had created the extensively flaked artefacts and early hand axes that mark the Acheulean culture, and by 1.6–1.4 million years ago, the new tool industry was widely established in East Africa. Acheulean tools differ from Oldowan tools in that the core forms of the tools were clearly deliberate. Whereas the shape of the core forms in Oldowan tools, which were probably used mostly as hammers to crack bones for marrow, appears to not have mattered much, the hand axes of the Acheulean culture demonstrate an intent to produce narrow and sharp objects, typically in teardrop, oval or triangular shapes. Once in place, the Acheulean industry remained unchanged throughout &quot;H. ergaster&quot;&#x27;s existence and later times, with tools produced near its end about 250,000 years ago not being significantly different from tools produced 1.65 million years ago.

The oldest Acheulean assemblages also preserve core forms similar to those in Oldowan tools, but there are no known true intermediate forms between the two, suggesting that the appearance of Acheulean tools was an abrupt and sudden development. The most significant development that led to the Acheulean tools was likely early hominins learning the ability to strike large flakes, up to 30 cm (1 ft) or more in length, from larger boulders, from which they could manufacture new tools such as hand axes. Though &quot;hand axe&quot; implies that all hand axes were used for chopping and were hand-held, they came in a variety of different shapes and size and probably served several different functions. Carefully shaped and symmetric examples may have been hurled at prey akin to modern discuses, more casually made examples may simply have served as portable sources for sharp flakes and some could have been used for scraping or chopping wood. Additionally, hand axes are effective butchering tools and were possibly also used for dismembering carcasses of large animals.

There are preserved hand axes that are too unwieldy and large to be used for any apparent practical purpose. The use of these larger hand axes, and for some discovered collections of hundreds of hand axes without obvious signs of use, is speculative and conjectural. An idea that has been popular in the popular press, and frequently cited in academia, is that large and impressive hand axes might have been emblems used for attracting mates, with makers of large axes showing strength, coordination and determination, qualities that may have been regarded as attractive. Palaeoanthropologists April Nowell and Melanie Lee Chang noted in 2009 that though this theory is &quot;both intriguing and emotionally appealing&quot;, there is little evidence for it and it is untestable. They considered it more probable that variations in hand axe morphology over the course of hundreds of thousands of years was the result of various different factors rather than a single, overarching factor in sexual selection.

==== Fire ====
As &quot;Homo&quot; migrated into open savannah environments, encounters with natural fires must have become more frequent and significant. It is possible that &quot;H. ergaster&quot; were the earliest humans to master the control of fire, which they may have used for cooking purposes. Cooking renders both meat and plant foods more digestible, which might have been important since the guts of &quot;H. ergaster&quot; were reduced in size compared to those of their ancestors. Though &quot;H. ergaster&quot;/&quot;H. erectus&quot; is frequently assumed to have been the earliest &quot;Homo&quot; to control fire, concrete evidence is somewhat lacking in the fossil record, perhaps partly due to the difficulty for actual evidence of fire usage to be preserved. Two of the earliest sites commonly claimed to preserve evidence of fire usage are FxJj20 at Koobi Fora and GnJi 1/6E near Lake Baringo, both in Kenya and both dated as up to 1.5 million years old. The evidence at FxJj20 consists of burned sediments and heat-altered stone tools, whereas GnJi 1/6E preserves large clasts of baked clay, associated with stone tools and faunal remains. Though it is difficult to exclude a natural origin for the fire residue evidenced, the sites remain strong candidates for early fire use.

Several sites, preserving more widely accepted evidence of fire usage, have been dated to 1 million years ago or younger, postdating the emergence and last generally accepted record of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. These sites include cave sites, such as Wonderwerk and Swartkrans in South Africa, and open sites, such as Kalambo Falls in Zambia. The site Gesher Benot Ya’aqov in Israel, dated to about 700,000 years ago, preserves widely accepted evidence of fire usage through burnt materials and burnt flint microartefacts being preserved at numerous levels. From around 400,000 years ago and onwards, traces of fire become even more numerous in sites across Africa, Europe and Asia.

=== Language ===
The spinal cord of Turkana Boy would have been narrower than that of modern humans, which means that the nervous system of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, and their respiratory muscles, may not have been developed enough to produce or control speech. In 2001, anthropologists Bruce Latimer and James Ohman concluded that Turkana Boy was afflicted by skeletal dysplasia and scoliosis, and thus would not have been representative of the rest of his species in this respect. In 2006, when anthropologist Marc Meyer and colleagues described a &quot;H. erectus&quot; s.l. specimen from Dmanisi, Georgia, dated to 1.78 million years old. The fossil preserves the oldest known &quot;Homo&quot; vertebrae and the spine found falls within the range of modern human spines, suggesting that the individual would have been capable of speech. Meyer and colleagues concluded that speech was probably possible within &quot;Homo&quot; very early on and that Turkana Boy probably suffered from some congenital defect, possibly spinal stenosis.

In 2013 and 2014, anthropologist Regula Schiess and colleagues concluded that there was no evidence of any congenital defects in Turkana Boy, and, in contrast to the 2001 and 2006 studies, considered the specimen to be representative of the species.

<text>L3 Technologies, formerly L-3 Communications Holdings, was an American company that supplied command and control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C3ISR) systems and products, avionics, ocean products, training devices and services, instrumentation, aerospace, and navigation products. Its customers included the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, United States Intelligence Community, NASA, aerospace contractors, and commercial telecommunications and wireless customers. In 2019, it merged with Harris Corporation to form L3Harris Technologies.

L3 was headquartered in Murray Hill, Manhattan, New York City.

==History==
L3 was formed as L-3 Communications in 1997 to acquire certain business units from Lockheed Martin that had previously been part of Loral Corporation. These units had belonged to Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, which had merged three years before in 1993.

===Management===
Frank Lanza, CEO and co-founder, died on June 7, 2006. CFO Michael T. Strianese was named as interim CEO, and was later appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company on October 23, 2006. In 2015, former Lockheed Martin executive Christopher E. Kubasik was named president and COO, with Strianese remaining as chairman and CEO. On July 19, 2017, Strianese announced that he would retire as CEO on December 31, 2017, to be succeeded by Kubasik, but would remain as board chairman. As of January 1, 2018, Christopher E. Kubasik became chief executive officer and president of L3 Technologies.

=== Naming ===
L3 Technologies was originally named L-3 Communications for the last initials of its founders Frank Lanza, Robert LaPenta, and Lehman Brothers. Despite the similarity in naming, there is no corporate connection between L3 Technologies, formerly known as L-3 Communications, and networking provider Level 3 Communications, whose name is often abbreviated &quot;L3&quot; in informal industry communication.

On December 31, 2016, the company changed its name from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the company&#x27;s wider focus since its founding in 1997. The company&#x27;s website changed from L-3com.com to L3T.com, but the company&#x27;s NYSE ticker symbol of LLL remained the same.

==Products==
* L-3 ProVision, Millimeter Wave Airport Passenger Screening System
* L-3 eXaminer SX, 3DX, and XLB, Airport baggage scanning systems
* L-3 OptEX, Trace level explosive detection system
* AVCATT, a mobile aviation training simulator
* Orchid, Total Development &amp; Simulation Environment (Power, Marine)
* EOTech, Holographic weapon sights
* L-3 Sonoma EO, Electro Optical Imaging Systems, 1508M Dragon Eyes, 1205MD, 2111X, 2514X, &amp; 2711G
* OMNI, an encryption device that adds secure voice and secure data to a standard analog telephone or modem connected computer, made in &quot;Standard&quot; model with a 56 kbit/s limit and &quot;OMNIxi&quot; with a 15 Mbit/s limit

==Controversies==

===Federal contract suspension===
In 2010, it was announced that L3&#x27;s Special Support Programs Division had been suspended by the United States Air Force from doing any contract work for the US federal government. A US Department of Defense investigation had reportedly found that the company had, &quot;used a highly sensitive government computer network to collect competitive business information for its own use.&quot; A US federal criminal investigation ended the temporary suspension on July 27, 2010.

===Counterfeit parts===
On November 4, 2010, L3 issued a part purge notification to prevent future use of Chinese counterfeit parts, but did not notify its customers whose display systems suffered from much higher than expected failure rates.

===EOTech defective holographic sights lawsuit===
In 2015, L3 Technologies agreed to pay $25.6 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Government. L3 was accused of knowingly providing the U.S. military with optics that failed in extreme temperatures and humid weather conditions. These sights were provided to infantry and special operations forces operating in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as civilians and law enforcement.

The civil fraud lawsuit was filed by Preet Bharara, in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged L3 officials have known since 2006 that the holographic sights being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan failed to perform as advertised in extreme temperature ranges. The lawsuit alleges that the FBI independently discovered the thermal drift defect, where the point-of-aim would shift when the sights were exposed to temperature extremes, in March 2015 and presented EOTech with &quot;the very same findings that the company had documented internally for years. Shortly thereafter, EOTech finally disclosed the thermal drift defect to the DoD.&quot; According to court documents, EOTech had advertised that its sights performed in temperatures ranging from -40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and in humid conditions.

<doc id="276748" wikidata="Q231317" url="?curid=276748" title="Zuni people">
<text>The Zuni (; formerly spelled &quot;Zuñi&quot;) are Native American Pueblo peoples native to the Zuni River valley. The Zuni people today are federally recognized as the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, and most live in the Pueblo of Zuni on the Zuni River, a tributary of the Little Colorado River, in western New Mexico, United States. The Pueblo of Zuni is south of Gallup, New Mexico. The Zuni tribe lived in multi level adobe houses. In addition to the reservation, the tribe owns trust lands in Catron County, New Mexico, and Apache County, Arizona. The Zuni call their homeland &quot;Halona Idiwan’a &quot;or Middle Place. The word &quot;Zuni&quot; is believed to derive from the Western Keres language (Acoma) word &quot;sɨ̂‧ni&quot;, or a cognate thereof.

==History==
Archaeology suggests that the Zuni have been farmers in the general area for 3,000 to 4,000 years. It is now thought that the Ancestral Zuni people inhabited the Zuni River valley from the last millennium B.C., when they began using irrigation to farm maize on at least household-sized plots.

Zuni culture is associated with Mogollon and Ancestral Pueblo peoples cultures, who lived in the deserts of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and southern Colorado for over two millennia. White Mound was one such settlement of pit houses, farming, and storerooms, built around 700 A.D., followed by the village of Kiatuthlanna around 800 A.D., and Allantown around 1000 A.D. These Mogollon villages included kivas. Likewise, Zuni ancestors were in contact with the Ancestral Puebloans at Chaco Canyon around 1100. The Zuni settlement called Village of the Great Kivas, was built around 1100, and included nine kivas. The Zuni region, however, was probably only sparsely populated by small agricultural settlements until the 12th century when the population and the size of the settlements began to increase. The large villages of Heshot Ula, Betatakin, and Kiet Siel were established by 1275. By the 13th century villages were built on top of mesas, including Atsinna on Inscription Rock. In the 14th century, the Zuni inhabited a dozen pueblos containing between 180 and 1,400 rooms, while the Anasazi abandoned larger settlements for smaller ones, or established new ones along the Rio Grande. The Zuni did move from the eastern portion of their territory to the western side, and built six new villages, Halona, Hawikuh, Kiakima, Matsaki, Kwakina, and Kechipaun. Halona was located 97 km north Zuni Salt Lake, and the Zuni traded in salt, corn and turquoise. Hawikuh was claimed by Niza to be one of the Seven Cities of Cibola, a legendary 16th century wealthy empire.

In 1539, Moorish slave Estevanico led an advance party of Fray Marcos de Niza&#x27;s Spanish expedition. Sponsored by Antonio de Mendoza who wanted Niza to &quot;explain to the natives of the land that there is only one God in heaven, and the Emperor on earth to rule and govern it, whose subjects they all must become and whom they must serve.&quot; The Zuni reportedly killed Estevanico as a spy, or for being &quot;greedy, voracious and bold&quot;. This was Spain&#x27;s first contact with any of the Pueblo peoples. Francisco Vásquez de Coronado expedition followed in the wake of Niza&#x27;s Seven Cities of Cibola claim. Sponsored once again by Mendoza, Coronado led 230 soldiers on horseback, 70 foot soldiers, several Franciscan priests and Mexican natives. The Spanish met 600 Zuni warriors near Hawikuh in July 1540, inflicting several casualties, and capturing the village. Coronado continued to the Rio Grande, but several priests and soldiers stayed an additional two years. The Chamuscado and Rodríguez Expedition followed in 1581, and Antonio de Espejo in 1583. Juan de Oñate visited Zuni territory in 1598 and 1604 looking for copper mines, but without success. Francisco Manuel de Silva Nieto established a mission at Hawikuh in 1629 with two Franciscan priests. They completed a church compound in 1632, and established a second mission in Halona. Shortly afterwards, the Zuni destroyed the missions, killing two priests, and then retreated to Dowa Yalanne, where they remained for the next three years. The Spanish built another mission in Halona in 1643.

Before the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Zuni lived in six villages. After the revolt, until 1692, they took refuge in a defensible position atop &quot;Dowa Yalanne&quot;, a steep mesa 5 km (3.1 miles) southeast of the present Pueblo of Zuni; &quot;Dowa&quot; means &quot;corn&quot;, and &quot;yalanne&quot; means &quot;mountain&quot;. After the establishment of peace and the return of the Spanish, the Zuni relocated to their present location, returning to the mesa top only briefly in 1703. By the end of the 17th century, only Halona was still inhabited of the original six villages. Yet, satellite villages were settled around Halona, and included Nutria, Ojo Caliente, and Pescado.

Of the three Zuni missions, only the church at Halona was rebuilt after the reconquest. According to Nancy Bonvillain, &quot;Indeed, by the late eighteenth century, Spanish authorities had given up hope of dominating the Zuni and other western Pueblo Indians, and in 1799 only seven Spanish people were recorded as living among the Zuni.&quot;. In 1821, the Franciscans ended their missionary efforts.

In 1848, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Henderson P. Boyakin signed a treaty with Zuni and Navajo leaders stating the Zuni &quot;shall be protected in the full management of all their rights of Private Property and Religion...[by] the authorities, civil and military, of New Mexico and the United States.&quot; Observing the Zuni in the 1850s, Balduin Möllhausen noted &quot;In all directions, fields of wheat and maize, as well as gourds and melons, bore testimony to their industry.&quot;

The Zuni Reservation was created by the United States federal government in 1877, and enlarged by a second Executive order in 1883.

Frank Hamilton Cushing, an anthropologist associated with the Smithsonian Institution, lived with the Zuni from 1879 to 1884. He was one of the first non-native participant-observers and ethnologists at Zuni. In 1979, it was reported that some members of the Pueblo consider he had wrongfully documented the Zuni way of life, exploiting them by photographing and revealing sacred traditions and ceremonies.

During the early 2000s, the Zuni opposed the development of a coal mine near the Zuni Salt Lake, a site sacred to the Zuni and under Zuni control. The mine would have extracted water from the aquifer below the lake and would also have involved construction between the lake and the Zuni. The plan was abandoned in 2003 after several lawsuits.

==Culture==

The Zuni traditionally speak the Zuni language, a language isolate that has no known relationship to any other Native American language. Linguists believe that the Zuni have maintained the integrity of their language for 6,000-to-7,000 years. The Zuni do, however, share a number of words from Keresan, Hopi, and Pima pertaining to religion. The Zuni continue to practice their traditional religion with its regular ceremonies and dances, and an independent and unique belief system.

The Zuni were and are a traditional people who live by irrigated agriculture and raising livestock. Gradually the Zuni farmed less and turned to sheep and cattle herding as a means of economic development. Their success as a desert agri-economy is due to careful management and conservation of resources, as well as a complex system of community support. Many contemporary Zuni also rely on the sale of traditional arts and crafts. Some Zuni still live in the old-style Pueblos, while others live in modern houses. Their location is relatively isolated, but they welcome respectful tourists.

The Zuni Tribal Fair and rodeo is held the third weekend in August. The Zuni also participate in the Gallup Inter-Tribal Ceremonial, usually held in early or mid-August. The is a tribal museum that showcases Zuni history, culture, and arts.

===Ethnobotany===
The Zuni utilize many local plants in their culture. For an extensive list, see the main article, &quot;Zuni ethnobotany&quot;. Zuni have developed knowledge of local plants that are used for medical practices and religious rites.

===Pottery===

Traditionally, Zuni women made pottery for storing food and water. They used symbols of their clans for designs. Clay for the pottery is sourced locally. Prior to its extraction, the women give thanks to the Earth Mother (&quot;Awidelin Tsitda&quot;) according to ritual. The clay is ground, sifted, mixed with water, rolled into a coil, shaped into a vessel or other design, and scraped smooth with a scraper. A thin layer of finer clay, called slip, is applied to the surface for extra smoothness and color. The vessel is polished with a stone after it dries. It is painted with home-made organic dyes, using a traditional yucca brush. The shape and painted images depend on the intended purpose of the pottery. To fire the pottery, the Zuni used animal dung in traditional kilns. Today, Zuni potters might use electric kilns. While the firing was usually a community enterprise, silence or communication in low voices was considered essential in order to maintain the original &quot;voice&quot; of the &quot;being&quot; of the clay, and the purpose of the end product. Sales of pottery and traditional arts provide a major source of income for many Zuni people today. An artisan may be the sole financial support for her immediate family as well as others. Many women make pottery or, more rarely, clothing or baskets. Brown, black and red ornamentation can be found on traditional Zuni pots that are first covered with white slip. Common motifs are spiral scrolls edged with triangles, deer, as well as frogs, dragonflies and other symbols associated with rain and water. In addition to pots, Zuni produce owl figurines that are covered with white slip and painted with black and red motifs before firing. 

===Carving and silversmithing===
Zuni also make fetishes and necklaces for the purpose of rituals and trade, and more recently for sale to collectors.

The Zuni are known for their fine lapidary work. Zuni jewelers set hand-cut turquoise and other stones in silver. Today jewelry-making thrives as an art form among the Zuni. Many Zuni have become master stone-cutters. Techniques used include mosaic and channel inlay to create intricate designs and unique patterns.

Two specialties of Zuni jewelers are needlepoint and petit point. In making needlepoint, small, slightly oval-shaped stones with pointed ends are set in silver bezels, close to one another and side by side to create a pattern. The technique is normally used with turquoise, sometimes with coral and occasionally with other stones in creating necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings. Petit point is made in the same fashion as needlepoint, except that one end of each stone is pointed, and the other end is rounded.

===Religion===
Religion is central to Zuni life. Their traditional religious beliefs are centered on the three most powerful of their deities: Earth Mother, Sun Father, and Moonlight-Giving Mother. The religion is katsina-based, and ceremonies occur during winter solstice, summer, harvest, and again in winter.

Priesthood includes three priests (north, above and below), and Pekwin (the above priest) determines the religious calendar. A religious society is associated with each of the six kivas, and each boy is initiated into one of these societies.

===Shalako===

Shalako is a series of ceremonial dances that take place throughout the night on or around the winter solstice. They are closed to non-native individuals unless there is a personal invitation by a tribal member. The ceremony also blesses the houses that were built during the year. The blessing takes the form of singing that accompanies six dancers who are dressed in Shalako outfits. These outfits can be as high as eight feet; the dancers wearing them represent &quot;couriers of the rain deities come to bless new homes&quot;. The dancers move from house to house throughout the night; at dawn Saiyatasha performs a final prayer and the ceremony is complete.

==In popular culture==
In the novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;, one of the main characters is a man named John of British descent who grew up among a community of Zuni people in New Mexico.

<text>Seitan (, ; ) is a food made from gluten, the main protein of wheat.
It is also known as miànjīn (), fu (), milgogi (), wheat meat, gluten meat, or simply gluten.

Wheat gluten is an alternative to soybean-based foods, such as tofu, which are sometimes used as a meat alternative. Some types of wheat gluten have a chewy or stringy texture that resembles meat more than other substitutes. Wheat gluten is often used instead of meat in Asian, vegetarian, vegan, Buddhist, and macrobiotic cuisines. Mock duck is a common use.

Wheat gluten first appeared during the 6th century as an ingredient for Chinese noodles. It has historically been popular in the cuisines of China, Japan and other East and Southeast Asian nations. In Asia, it is commonly found on the menus of restaurants catering primarily to Buddhist customers who do not eat meat.

==Production==

Gluten is traditionally extracted from wheat flour. A dough is washed in water until most of the starch granules have been removed, leaving behind the sticky, insoluble gluten as an elastic mass. This mass is cooked in a variety of ways and eaten.
There are several industrial methods for separating gluten from starch.

Powdered forms of wheat gluten are also commercially produced and sold as an alternative way to make seitan. Their production involves hydrating hard wheat flour to activate the gluten, and then processing the hydrated mass to remove the starch. This leaves only the gluten, which is then dried and ground back into a powder. When prepared to eat, seitan is generally marinated with a variety of ingredients.

==History==
Called &quot;miànjīn&quot; (), this way of preparing wheat gluten has been documented in China since the 6th century. It is widely consumed by the Chinese as a substitute for meat, especially among monastic and lay adherents of Chinese Buddhism. The oldest reference to wheat gluten appears in the &quot;Qimin Yaoshu&quot;, a Chinese agricultural encyclopedia written by Jia Sixie in 535. The encyclopedia mentions noodles prepared from wheat gluten called &quot;bótuō&quot; (). Wheat gluten was known as &quot;miànjīn&quot; () by the Song dynasty (960–1279).

Traditionally food is perceived as kitchen medicine within Chinese culture, gluten is part of traditional Chinese food therapy called shí liáo (食療), and was prescribed by traditional Chinese medicinal physicians to treat a wide range of illnesses and disease.

Wheat gluten arrived in the West by the 18th century. &quot;De Frumento&quot;, an Italian treatise on wheat written in Latin by Bartolomeo Beccari in 1728 and published in Bologna in 1745, describes the process of washing wheat flour dough to extract the gluten. John Imison wrote an English-language definition of wheat gluten in his &quot;Elements of Science and Art&quot; published in 1803. By the 1830s, Western doctors were recommending wheat gluten in diets for diabetics. In the United States, the Seventh-day Adventists promoted the consumption of wheat gluten from the late 19th century. Sanitarium Foods, a company affiliated with John Harvey Kellogg&#x27;s Battle Creek Sanitarium, advertised wheat gluten in 1882.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;seitan&quot; is of Japanese origin and was coined in 1961 by George Ohsawa, a Japanese advocate of the macrobiotic diet, having been shown it by one of his students, Kiyoshi Mokutani. In 1962, wheat gluten was sold as seitan in Japan by Marushima Shoyu K.K. It was imported to the West under that name in 1969 by the American company Erewhon. The etymology of &quot;seitan&quot; is uncertain, but it is believed to come from combining the characters 生 (sei, &quot;fresh, raw&quot;) and 蛋 (tan, from 蛋白 (tanpaku, &quot;protein&quot;)).

The meaning of the word &quot;seitan&quot; has undergone a gradual evolution. One early commercial product, imported from Japan in 1969, was a salty condiment, the color of soy sauce, sold in a small glass jar or plastic pouch, which was used as a seasoning for brown rice. The name gradually came to refer to any wheat gluten seasoned with soy sauce. The people most responsible for this change in the USA were Nik and Joanne Amartseff, who introduced Tan Pups in 1972, and John Weissman, who in 1974 introduced Wheatmeat (first meatballs then cutlets made of seitan) in Boston. All worked for years to popularize these products at the Erewhon retail store, and developed a trademark on the Wheatmeat name.

==Preparation==
While wheat gluten itself is rather flavorless, it holds a marinade very well and is usually simmered in a &quot;dashi&quot; (broth) made from soy sauce, kombu, ginger, and sometimes also sesame oil.

===Chinese===
Wheat gluten, called &quot;miànjīn&quot; in Chinese (traditional: , simplified: , literally &quot;dough tendon&quot;; also spelled &quot;mien chin&quot; in Latin script) is believed to have originated in ancient China, as a meat substitute for adherents of Buddhism, particularly some Mahayana Buddhist monks, who are strict vegetarians (see Buddhist cuisine). One story attributes the invention of imitation meat to chefs who made it for Chinese emperors who traditionally observed a week of vegetarianism each year. &quot;Miànjīn&quot; is often deep fried before being further cooked in Chinese cuisine, which confers a crispy rind that enhances the texture of the gluten. There are three primary Chinese forms of wheat gluten.Oil-fried gluten (, &quot;yóumiànjīn&quot;) is raw gluten that has been torn into small bits, and then deep-fried into puffy balls of in diameter and sold as &quot;imitation abalone&quot;. They are golden brown, and cooked by braising or boiling in a savory soup or stew. They are frequently paired with &quot;xiānggū&quot; (black mushrooms). Larger fried balls of gluten, called &quot;miànjīnqiú&quot; () or &quot;miànjīnpào&quot; (麵筋泡), which may be up to in diameter, are sometimes seen in Asian supermarkets, often stuffed with meat or tofu mixtures and served as a dish called &quot;gluten meatballs&quot; (, &quot;Miànjīn roùwán&quot;) or &quot;gluten stuffed with meat&quot; (, &quot;miànjīn saī roù&quot;).

Steamed gluten (, &quot;zhēngmiànjīn&quot;), is raw gluten that has been wrapped around itself to form a long sausage shape which is then steamed. This type of gluten has a dense texture and ranges from off-white to light greenish grey in color. It is torn open into strips and used as a cooking ingredient. When this sausage-shaped gluten is thickly sliced into medallions, the resulting form is called &quot;miànlún&quot; (, &quot;gluten wheels&quot;). Larger blocks of steamed gluten are sometimes colored pink and sold as vegetarian &quot;mock ham.&quot; Steamed gluten is also a well-known food in Xi&#x27;an. Steamed gluten can be served with bean sprouts and cucumbers as a cold dish, or served with &quot;liángpí&quot; ().
Baked spongy gluten () is similar in texture to a sponge, &quot;kaofu&quot; (sometimes labeled in English as &quot;bran puff&quot;) is made by leavening raw gluten, and then baking or steaming it. These are sold as small blocks in Chinese markets, and are diced and cooked. This type of gluten absorbs its cooking liquid like a sponge and is enjoyed for its &quot;juicy&quot; character. Chinese &quot;kaofu&quot; has a different texture from its Japanese counterpart, &quot;yaki-fu&quot;, due to the relatively larger air bubbles it contains. &quot;Kaofu&quot; is available fresh, frozen, dehydrated, and canned.

&quot;Miànjīn&quot; is also available in Asian grocery stores in cans and jars, often marinated in combination with peanuts or mushrooms. Such canned and jarred gluten is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to congee (boiled rice porridge) as part of a traditional Chinese breakfast. Depending on its method of preparation and ingredients used, both fresh and preserved &quot;miànjīn&quot; can be used to simulate pork, poultry, beef, or seafood.

&quot;Miànjīn&quot; can also refer to latiao, a modern Chinese snack food consisting of a strip of &quot;miànjīn&quot; (in the gluten sense), generally with a spicy and savory flavoring.

===Japanese===
In Japanese cuisine, the traditional type of wheat gluten is called (, &quot;gluten&quot;), deriving from the Wu Chinese pronunciation of , &quot;fu&quot;. In Japan, the two main types of &quot;fu&quot; are most widely used in Buddhist vegetarian cooking (&quot;Shōjin ryōri&quot;) and tea ceremony cuisine (&quot;cha-kaiseki&quot;). There are two main forms of &quot;fu&quot;, the raw &quot;nama-fu&quot;, and dry-baked &quot;yaki-fu&quot;.

Raw (&quot;nama-fu&quot; ) is solid gluten which is mixed with glutinous rice flour and millet and steamed in large blocks. It may be shaped and colored in a variety of ways, using ingredients such as mugwort. Popular shapes include autumn-colored maple leaves and bunnies. Such shapes and colors enhance the attractiveness of the cooked product since steamed gluten has an unappealing grey hue. &quot;Nama-fu&quot; is an important ingredient in Shōjin-ryōri, the Buddhist vegetarian cuisine of Japan. It may also be used as an ingredient in wagashi, Japanese confectionery. Fu-manjū () is a type of manjū made from &quot;nama-fu&quot;. Solid gluten is sweetened and filled with various sweet fillings such as red bean paste. They are then wrapped in leaves and steamed in a manner similar to that used to prepare Chinese zongzi.
Dry baked (&quot;yaki-fu&quot; or &quot;sukiyaki-fu&quot; ) is gluten leavened with baking powder and baked into long bread-like sticks. It is often sold in cut form, as hard dry discs resembling croutons or bread rusk. Yaki-fu is typically added to miso soup and sukiyaki, where it absorbs some of the broth and acquires a fine texture that is lighter and fluffier than its Chinese equivalent. It is the most commonly available type of &quot;fu&quot; in Japanese supermarkets.

In Japan, seitan, initially a rather salty macrobiotic seasoning that gradually evolved into a food, is not well known or widely available, despite the macrobiotic diet&#x27;s Japanese origins. When used, the terms for this food are rendered in katakana as (Romanized &quot;gurutenmīto&quot;, from the English &quot;gluten meat&quot;), or, rarely, (&quot;seitan&quot;). Outside macrobiotic circles, these terms are virtually unknown in Japan, and they do not typically appear in Japanese dictionaries.

Along with tofu and Abura-age, fu can be used as a substitute for meat in Japanese cuisine.

===Vietnamese===
In Vietnam, wheat gluten is called or &quot;&quot;, and is prepared in a similar fashion to Chinese &quot;miàn jīn&quot;. Along with tofu, it is a part of the Buddhist cuisine of Vietnam.

===Western===

Since the mid-20th century, wheat gluten (usually called seitan) has been increasingly adopted by vegetarians in Western nations as a meat alternative. It is sold in block, strip and shaped forms in North America, where it can be found in some supermarkets, Asian food markets, health food stores and cooperatives.

The block form of seitan is often flavored with shiitake or portobello mushrooms, fresh coriander or onion, or barbecue sauce, or packed in a vegetable-based broth. In strip form, it can be packed to be eaten right out of the package as a high-protein snack. Shaped seitan products, in the form of &quot;ribs&quot; and patties, are frequently flavored with barbecue, teriyaki, or other savory sauces.

In North America, several brand-name meat alternatives are used in the restaurant and food service markets.

Wheat gluten is also used in many vegetarian products in various countries, for example by The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, a Black vegan religious sect in Israel that operates a chain of restaurants, to produce vegetarian sandwiches.

<doc id="276753" wikidata="Q5157437" url="?curid=276753" title="Computer Fraud and Abuse Act">
<text>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA) is a United States cybersecurity bill that was enacted in 1986 as an amendment to existing computer fraud law (), which had been included in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. Prior to computer-specific criminal laws, computer crimes were prosecuted as mail and wire fraud, but the applying law was often insufficient.

The original 1984 bill was enacted in response to concern that computer-related crimes might go unpunished. The House Committee Report to the original computer crime bill included a statement by a representative of GTE-owned Telenet that characterized the 1983 techno-thriller film &quot;WarGames&quot;—in which a young teenager (played by Matthew Broderick) from Seattle breaks into a U.S. military supercomputer programmed to predict possible outcomes of nuclear war and unwittingly almost starts World War III—as &quot;a realistic representation of the automatic dialing and access capabilities of the personal computer.&quot;

The CFAA was written to extend existing tort law to intangible property, while, in theory, limiting federal jurisdiction to cases &quot;with a compelling federal interest—i.e., where computers of the federal government or certain financial institutions are involved or where the crime itself is interstate in nature&quot;, but its broad definitions have spilled over into contract law (see &quot;Protected Computer&quot;, below). In addition to amending a number of the provisions in the original &quot;section 1030&quot;, the CFAA also criminalized additional computer-related acts. Provisions addressed the distribution of malicious code and denial-of-service attacks. Congress also included in the CFAA a provision criminalizing trafficking in passwords and similar items.

Since then, the Act has been amended a number of times—in 1989, 1994, 1996, in 2001 by the USA PATRIOT Act, 2002, and in 2008 by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act. With each amendment of the law, the types of conduct that fell within its reach were extended. In 2015, President Barack Obama proposed expanding the CFAA and the RICO Act. DEF CON organizer and Cloudflare researcher Marc Rogers, Senator Ron Wyden, and Representative Zoe Lofgren stated opposition to this on the grounds it would make many regular internet activities illegal. In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled in Van Buren v. United States to provide a narrow interpretation of the meaning of &quot;exceeds authorized access&quot;.

==Protected computers==
The only computers, in theory, covered by the CFAA are defined as &quot;protected computers&quot;. They are defined under section to mean a computer:
* exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or any computer, when the conduct constituting the offense affects the computer&#x27;s use by or for the financial institution or the government; or
* which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States ...

In practice, any ordinary computer has come under the jurisdiction of the law, including cellphones, due to the interstate nature of most Internet communication.

==Criminal offenses under the Act==
(a) Whoever—
:(1) having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access, and by means of such conduct having obtained information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or foreign relations, or any restricted data, as defined in paragraph y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation willfully communicates, delivers, transmits, or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;

::(C) demand or request for money or other thing of value in relation to damage to a protected computer, where such damage was caused to facilitate the extortion

==Specific sections==
* : Computer espionage. This section takes much of its language from the Espionage Act of 1917, with the notable addition being that it also covers information related to &quot;Foreign Relations&quot;, not simply &quot;National Defense&quot; like the Espionage Act.
* : Computer trespassing, and taking government, financial, or commerce info
* : Computer trespassing in a government computer
* : Committing fraud with computer
* : Damaging a protected computer (including viruses, worms)
* : Trafficking in passwords of a government or commerce computer
* : Threatening to damage a protected computer
* : Conspiracy to violate (a)
* : Penalties
* : Investigative, protective, and intelligence activities

==Notable cases and decisions referring to the Act==

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is both a criminal law and a statute that creates a private right of action, allowing compensation and injunctive or other equitable relief to anyone harmed by a violation of this law. These provisions have allowed private companies to sue disloyal employees for damages for the misappropriation of confidential information (trade secrets).

===Criminal cases===
* &quot;United States v. Morris (1991)&quot;, 928 F.2d 504 (2d Cir. 1991), decided March 7, 1991. After the release of the Morris worm, an early computer worm, its creator was convicted under the Act for causing damage and gaining unauthorized access to &quot;federal interest&quot; computers. The Act was amended in 1996, in part, to clarify language whose meaning was disputed in the case.
* &quot;United States v. Lori Drew&quot;, 2009. The cyberbullying case involving the suicide of a girl harassed on MySpace. Charges were under 18 USC 1030(a)(2)(c) and (b)(2)(c). Judge Wu decided that using against someone violating a terms of service agreement would make the law overly broad. 259 F.R.D. 449 
*&quot;United States v. Rodriguez&quot;, 2010. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Social Security Administration employee had violated the CFAA when he used an SSA database to look up information about people he knew personally.
* &quot;United States v. Collins et al&quot;, 2011. A group of men and women connected to the collective Anonymous signed a plea deal to charges of conspiring to disrupt access to the payment website PayPal in response to the payment shutdown to WikiLeaks over the Wau Holland Foundation which was part of a wider Anonymous campaign, Operation Payback. They later became known under the name PayPal 14.
* &quot;United States v. Aaron Swartz&quot;, 2011. Aaron Swartz allegedly entered an MIT wiring closet and set up a laptop to mass-download articles from JSTOR. He allegedly avoided various attempts by JSTOR and MIT to stop this, such as MAC address spoofing. He was indicted for violating CFAA provisions (a)(2), (a)(4), (c)(2)(B)(iii), (a)(5)(B), and (c)(4)(A)(i)(I),(VI). The case was dismissed after Swartz committed suicide in January 2013.
* &quot;United States v. Nosal&quot;, 2011. Nosal and others allegedly accessed a protected computer to take a database of contacts from his previous employer for use in his own business, violating 1030(a)(4). This was a complex case with multiple trips to the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that violating a website&#x27;s terms of use is not a violation of the CFAA. He was convicted in 2013. In 2016, the Ninth Circuit ruled that he had acted &quot;without authorization&quot; when he used the username and password of a current employee with their consent and affirmed his conviction. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
* &quot;United States v. Peter Alfred-Adekeye&quot; 2011. Adekeye allegedly violated (a)(2), when he allegedly downloaded CISCO IOS, allegedly something that the CISCO employee who gave him an access password did not permit. Adekeye was CEO of Multiven and had accused CISCO of anti-competitive practices.
* &quot;United States v Sergey Aleynikov&quot;, 2011. Aleynikov was a programmer at Goldman Sachs accused of copying code, like high-frequency trading code, allegedly in violation of 1030(a)(2)(c) and 1030(c)(2)(B)i–iii and 2. This charge was later dropped, and he was instead charged with theft of trade secrets and transporting stolen property.
* &quot;United States v Nada Nadim Prouty&quot;, . Prouty was an FBI and CIA agent who was prosecuted for having a fraudulent marriage to get US residency. She claims she was persecuted by a U.S. attorney who was trying to gain media coverage by calling her a terrorist agent and get himself promoted to a federal judgeship.
* &quot;United States v. Neil Scott Kramer&quot;, 2011. Kramer was a court case where a cellphone was used to coerce a minor into engaging sex with an adult. Central to the case was whether a cellphone constituted a computer device. Ultimately, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that a cell phone can be considered a computer if &quot;the phone perform[s] arithmetic, logical, and storage functions&quot;, paving the way for harsher consequences for criminals engaging with minors over cellphones.
* &quot;United States v. Kane&quot;, 2011. Exploiting a software bug in a poker machine does not constitute hacking because the poker machine in question failed to constitute a &quot;protected computer&quot; under the statute (as the poker machine in question did not demonstrate a tangential relationship to interstate commerce) and because the sequence of button presses that triggered the bug were considered held to have &quot;not exceed[ed] their authorized access.&quot; the defendant still faces a regular wire fraud charge.
*&quot;United States v. Valle&quot;, 2015. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a conviction against a police officer who had used a police database to look up information about women he knew personally.
*&quot;Van Buren v. United States&quot;, 2020. A police officer in Georgia was caught in an FBI sting operation using his authorized access to a license plate database to check the identity of a person for cash payment, an &quot;improper purpose&quot;. The officer was convicted and sentenced to 18 months under CFAA §1030(a)(2). Though he appealed his conviction on the basis that the &quot;improper purpose&quot; was not &quot;exceeding authorized access&quot;, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the conviction based on precedent. The Supreme Court ruled in June 2021 that under CFAA, that a person &quot;exceeds authorized access&quot; of a computer system they otherwise have access to when they access files and other content that are off-limits to the portions of the computer system they were authorized to access. Their opinion restricted CFAA from applying to cases where a person obtains information from areas they do have authorized access to, but uses that information for improper reasons.

===Civil cases===
* &quot;Theofel v. Farey Jones&quot;, 2003 U.S. App. Lexis 17963, decided August 28, 2003 (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit), holding that the use of a civil subpoena which is &quot;patently unlawful,&quot; &quot;in bad faith,&quot; or &quot;at least gross negligence&quot; to gain access to stored email is a breach of both the CFAA and the Stored Communications Act.
* &quot;International Airport Centers, L.L.C. v. Citrin&quot;, 2006, , in which the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Jacob Citrin had violated the CFAA when he deleted files from his company computer before he quit, in order to conceal alleged bad behavior while he was an employee.
* &quot;LVRC Holdings v. Brekka&quot;, 2009 1030(a)(2), 1030(a)(4), in which LVRC sued Brekka for allegedly taking information about clients and using it to start his own competing business. The Ninth Circuit ruled that an employee accesses a company computer to gather information for his own purposes does not violate the CFAA merely because that personal use was adverse to the interests of the employer.
* &quot;Craigslist v. 3Taps&quot;, 2012. 3Taps was accused by Craigslist of breaching CFAA by circumventing an IP block in order to access Craigslist&#x27;s website and scrape its classified ads without consent. In August 2013, US federal judge found 3Taps&#x27;s actions violated CFAA and that it faces civil damages for &quot;unauthorized access&quot;. Judge Breyer wrote in his decision that &quot;the average person does not use &quot;anonymous proxies&quot; to bypass an IP block set up to enforce a banning communicated via personally-addressed cease-and-desist letter&quot;. He also noted &quot;Congress apparently knew how to restrict the reach of the CFAA to only certain kinds of information, and it appreciated the public v. nonpublic distinction—but [the relevant section] contains no such restrictions or modifiers.&quot;
* &quot;Lee v. PMSI, Inc.&quot;, 2011. PMSI, Inc. sued former employee Lee for violating the CFAA by browsing Facebook and checking personal email in violation of the company&#x27;s acceptable use policy. The court found that breaching an employer&#x27;s acceptable use policy was not &quot;unauthorized access&quot; under the act and, therefore, did not violate the CFAA.
* &quot;Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz&quot; and &quot;Hotz v. SCEA&quot;, 2011. SCEA sued &quot;Geohot&quot; and others for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3 system. The lawsuit alleged, among other things, that Hotz violated ([by] taking info from any protected computer). Hotz denied liability and contested the Court&#x27;s exercise of personal jurisdiction over him. The parties settled out of court. The settlement caused Geohot to be unable to legally hack the PlayStation 3 system furthermore.
* &quot;Pulte Homes, Inc. v. Laborers&#x27; International Union&quot; 2011. Pulte Homes brought a CFAA suit against the Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America (LIUNA). After Pulte fired an employee represented by the union, LIUNA urged members to call and send email to the company, expressing their opinions. As a result of the increased traffic, the company&#x27;s email system crashed. The Sixth Circuit ruled that the LIUNA&#x27;s instruction to call and email &quot;intentionally caused damage,&quot; reversing the lower court&#x27;s decision.
*&quot;Facebook v. Power Ventures and Vachani&quot;, 2016. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the CFAA was violated when Facebook&#x27;s servers were accessed despite an IP block and cease and desist order.
*HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn, 2019. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that scraping a public website without the approval of the website&#x27;s owner is not a violation of the CFAA. LinkedIn petitioned for the Supreme Court to review the decision and the court remanded the case based on its Van Buren v. United States decision. The Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed its original decision.
*&quot;Sandvig v. Barr&quot;, 2020. The Federal District Court of D.C. ruled that the CFAA does not criminalize the violation of a website&#x27;s terms of service.

==Criticism==
There have been criminal convictions for CFAA violations in the context of civil law, for breach of contract or terms of service violations. Many common and insignificant online acts, such as password-sharing and copyright infringement, can transform a CFAA misdemeanor into a felony. The punishments are severe, similar to sentences for selling or importing drugs, and may be disproportionate. Prosecutors have used the CFAA to protect private business interests and to intimidate free-culture activists, deterring undesirable, yet legal, conduct.

One such example regarding the harshness of the law was shown in United States vs. Tyler King, where King refused initial offers by the government for involvement in a conspiracy to &quot;gain unauthorized access&quot; to a computer system for a small company that an ex-girlfriend of King worked for. His role, even while not directly involved, resulted in 6.5 years imprisonment. No financial motive was established. A non-profit was started to advocate against further harshness against others targeted under the broad law.

Tim Wu called the CFAA &quot;the worst law in technology&quot;.

Professor of Law Ric Simmons notes that many provisions of the CFAA merely combine identical language to pre-existing federal laws with &quot;the element of “access[ing] a protected computer without authorization, or [by] exceed[ing] authorized access,&quot; meaning that &quot;the CFAA merely provides an additional charge for prosecutors to bring if the defendant used a computer while committing the crime.&quot; Professor Joseph Olivenbaum has similarly criticized the CFAA&#x27;s &quot;computer-specific approach,&quot; noting both the risk of redundancy and resultant definitional problems.

The CFAA increasingly presents real obstacles to journalists reporting stories important to the public’s interest. As data journalism increasingly becomes “a good way of getting to the truth of things . . . in this post-truth era,” as one data journalist told Google, the need for further clarity around the CFAA increases.

As per Star Kashman, an expert in cybersecurity law, the CFAA presents some challenges in cases related to Search Engine Hacking (also known as Google Dorking). Although Kashman states that accessing publicly available information is legal under the CFAA, she also notes that in many cases Search Engine Hacking is ultimately prosecuted under the CFAA. Kashman believes prosecuting cases of Google Dorking under the CFAA could render the CFAA void for vagueness by making it illegal to access publicly available information.

===Aaron Swartz===

In the wake of the prosecution and subsequent suicide of Aaron Swartz (who used a script to download scholarly research articles in excess of what JSTOR terms of service allowed), lawmakers proposed amending the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Representative Zoe Lofgren drafted a bill that would help &quot;prevent what happened to Aaron from happening to other Internet users&quot;. Aaron&#x27;s Law (, ) would exclude terms of service violations from the 1984 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and from the wire fraud statute.

In addition to Lofgren&#x27;s efforts, Representatives Darrell Issa and Jared Polis (also on the House Judiciary Committee) raised questions in the immediate aftermath of Swartz&#x27;s death regarding the government&#x27;s handling of the case. Polis called the charges &quot;ridiculous and trumped up,&quot; referring to Swartz as a &quot;martyr.&quot; Issa, chair of the House Oversight Committee, announced an investigation of the Justice Department&#x27;s prosecution.

By May 2014, Aaron&#x27;s Law had stalled in committee. Filmmaker Brian Knappenberger alleges this occurred due to Oracle Corporation&#x27;s financial interest in maintaining the status quo.

Aaron&#x27;s Law was reintroduced in May 2015 (, ) and again stalled. There has been no further introduction of related bills.

==Amendments history==

2008
* Eliminated the requirement that information must have been stolen through an interstate or foreign communication, thereby expanding jurisdiction for cases involving theft of information from computers;

* Expanded to criminalize not only explicit threats to cause damage to a computer, but also threats to (1) steal data on a victim&#x27;s computer, (2) publicly disclose stolen data, or (3) not repair damage the offender already caused to the computer;
* Created a criminal offense for conspiring to commit a computer hacking offense under section 1030;
* Broadened the definition of &quot;protected computer&quot; in to the full extent of Congress&#x27;s commerce power by including those computers used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication; and

<text>Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives (ISDA, also known as Smith-[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives|IIA]]) is a voting system criterion which says that the winner of an election should not be affected by candidates who are not in the Smith set.

Another way of defining ISDA is to say that adding a new candidate should not change the winner of an election, &quot;unless&quot; that new candidate would beats the original winner, either directly or indirectly (by beating a candidate who beats a candidate who... who beats the winner).

== Complying methods ==
Schulze and Ranked Pairs are independent of Smith-dominated alternatives. Any voting system can be forced to satisfy ISDA by first eliminating all candidates outside the Smith set, then running the full algorithm.

== Ambiguity ==
Smith-IIA can sometimes be taken to mean independence of non-Smith &quot;irrelevant&quot; alternatives, i.e. that no &quot;losing&quot; candidate outside the Smith set can affect the result. This differs slightly from the above definition, in that methods passing independence of irrelevant alternatives (but not the Smith criterion) also satisfy this definition of Smith-IIA.

If the criterion is taken to mean independence of non-Smith alternatives, regardless of whether they are relevant (i.e. winners) or not, Smith-independence requires passing the Smith criterion.

<text>Macy&#x27;s, Inc. (previously Federated Department Stores, Inc.) is an American holding company of department stores. Upon its establishment in 1929, Federated held ownership of the regional department store chains Abraham &amp; Straus, Lazarus, Filene&#x27;s, and Shillito&#x27;s. Bloomingdale&#x27;s joined Federated Department Stores the next year. Throughout its early history, frequent acquisitions and divestitures saw the company operate a number of nameplates. In 1994, Federated took over Macy&#x27;s, the old department store chain originally founded in 1858 by American entrepreneur Rowland Hussey Macy. Despite Federated&#x27;s long history of preserving regional nameplates, its acquisition of the May Department Stores Company in 2005 marked the end of those nameplates. By the following year, both the Macy&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s brands had replaced them nationwide. Ultimately, Federated itself was renamed Macy&#x27;s, Inc. in 2007, an acknowledgment of the old store&#x27;s venerable name; the company bought Bluemercury in 2015 from Berry J. Beck and Marla Malcolm Beck, allowing the company to expand into beauty stores.

Macy&#x27;s, Inc. owns the department store chains Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Macy&#x27;s, and beauty store chain Bluemercury, all of which operate flagship stores in Manhattan. , it operates 722 locations in the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The company was the world&#x27;s largest fashion goods retailer and the 36th-largest retailer overall in 2010. Macy&#x27;s, Inc. has been headquartered within Macy&#x27;s Herald Square in New York City since 2020, and was previously headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1945 until 2020.

== Operations as Federated ==
=== Early history ===
Federated Department Stores traces its corporate lineage to F&amp;R Lazarus &amp; Company, founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1851. In the summer of 1929, months before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Fred Lazarus Jr. met with Walter N. Rothschild from Abraham &amp; Straus of Brooklyn and Edward Filene from Filene&#x27;s of Boston on Rothschild&#x27;s yacht in Long Island Sound. The three businessmen agreed to merge their stores and form Federated Department Stores, as a department store holding company for F&amp;R Lazarus &amp; Company (including its Cincinnati division, then known as Shillito&#x27;s), Abraham &amp; Straus, and William Filene&#x27;s Sons of Boston. In 1930, Bloomingdale Brothers of New York joined.

In the mid-1930s, a modern merchandising standard was set when Fred Lazarus Jr. arranged garments in groups of a single size with a range of style, color and price, basing the technique upon observations made in Paris. As well, Lazarus convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt that it would help American economy to change the Thanksgiving holiday from the last Thursday of November to the fourth Thursday, thus extending the Christmas shopping season. An act of Congress perpetuated the arrangement in 1941. Black Friday became a nationwide sensation and the most profitable day for Federated. (Robert Lazarus Jr. worked at Federated until he died in 2013, the last remaining family member with an official role at the company.)

In 1945, Federated moved its corporate offices to Cincinnati. The latter half of the 20th century saw the company expand nationwide, adding Rike Kumler of Dayton, Ohio (merged into Shillito&#x27;s in the 1980s to become Shillito-Rike&#x27;s); Burdines of Miami, Florida; Rich&#x27;s of Atlanta, Georgia; Foley&#x27;s of Houston, Texas; Sanger Brothers and A. Harris, both of Dallas, Texas (which were merged to form Sanger-Harris); Boston Store of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; MainStreet of Chicago, Illinois; Bullock&#x27;s, of Los Angeles; I. Magnin, of San Francisco, California; Gold Circle; and Richway Discount Department Stores of Worthington, Ohio. Federated entered the supermarket industry in 1968 when it acquired the Ralphs chain based in Southern California. In 1982, Federated acquired the Twin Fair, Inc. discount store chain based in Buffalo, New York, and merged it with Gold Circle. In 1983, Federated sold four shopping center properties to JMB Realty.

=== Acquisition by Campeau ===
Canadian real estate developer Robert Campeau – who had taken over and dismembered Allied Stores in 1986 – attempted to take over Federated starting in early 1988 which Federated fought off in a high-profile battle, with Macy&#x27;s (at that time not part of Federated, but a rival), also submitting competitive bids of over $6 billion. Nonetheless, in April 1988, Federated gave in and agreed to a $6.6 billion takeover by Campeau. It was the largest merger in corporate history, barring the oil sector. Macy&#x27;s paid Campeau $1.1 billion to acquire the 20-store Bullock&#x27;s/Bullocks Wilshire and the 25-store specialty apparel chain I. Magnin. Two years later, Federated filed for bankruptcy after Campeau failed to refinance the debt of Federated and Allied Stores Corp. In 1992, Campeau was ousted and Federated emerged from bankruptcy as a new public company, Federated Stores, Inc., dropping the word &quot;Department&quot; from the previous company. As part of the reorganization, Federated sold the Ralphs chain to a group of owners led by Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation.

=== Acquisition of Macy&#x27;s ===
Also in 1992, Macy&#x27;s declared bankruptcy; Federated acquired it two years later, in 1994. The name of the once-main-rival of Federated, Macy&#x27;s, would soon become the consumer-facing identity of most of Federated&#x27;s stores.

In 1995 Federated bought Broadway Stores, Inc. and its California-based Emporium-Capwell, Weinstock&#x27;s and The Broadway chains. Macy&#x27;s changed the nameplate of these three chains and Bullock&#x27;s to Macy&#x27;s, or in some cases, turned locations into Bloomingdales. In 2003, Federated changed the nameplates of almost all their remaining non-Macy&#x27;s stores – the lone exception was Bloomingdales – to include the Macy&#x27;s name, a rebranding internally dubbed Project Hyphen. For example, Seattle-based The Bon Marché became Bon-Macy&#x27;s; Goldsmith&#x27;s in Tennessee became Goldsmith&#x27;s-Macy&#x27;s; Lazarus, Burdines, and Rich&#x27;s also added &quot;-Macy&#x27;s&quot; to their name. A year later, the hyphenated names were changed to simply Macy&#x27;s, a rebranding process referred internally to as Project Star.

Federated began selling goods online in 1998, rather later than most contemporary large retailers; Federated ran a private bank, FDS Bank, which issued and maintained the majority of its own consumer credit card portfolio, was one of the last credit card banks to begin to allow its cardholders to access account information online (around 2004).

In 1998, Federated settled an SEC investigation for $14.46 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) due to unethical debt-collection practices. Federated routinely forced credit card holders/debtors to sign an agreement that legally bound them to repay their outstanding balances instead of having the unsecured debt discharge via the filing of bankruptcy. Federated failed to file reaffirmation agreements with bankruptcy courts. As a result, the changes in the agreements were not legally binding.

In 2001 Federated acquired Liberty House of Hawaii as it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was managed as part of Macy&#x27;s West and all the store names were changed to Macy&#x27;s. The department store chain Stern&#x27;s, a division of Federated, ceased operations in 2001 and most of its stores became Macy&#x27;s stores.

In 2005, Federated agreed to sell its credit card business to Citigroup.

=== Acquisition of May ===

On February 28, 2005, Federated Department Stores announced that it would acquire May Department Stores company for $11 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025). Also part of the buyout was the bridal and formal unit of May, consisting of David&#x27;s Bridal and After Hours Formalwear. Federated would also assume $6 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025) of May&#x27;s debt, bringing total consideration to $17 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025). The deal would create the nation&#x27;s largest department store chain with over 1,000 stores and $30 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025) in annual sales. To help finance the deal, Federated agreed to sell its combined proprietary credit card business (but still administered by FACS Group, a subsidiary of Federated) to Citigroup. The merger was completed on August 30, 2005, after an assurance agreement was reached with the Attorneys General of New York, California, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

As a result of the merger, Federated also in the process reacquired two of their former department store chains Foley&#x27;s &amp; Filene&#x27;s (Which Federated originally sold to May Company), putting them back under the Federated Department Stores corporate umbrella for the first time since 1988.

Federated announced plans to sell 80 store locations in 2006, having pledged in its settlement to sell most of them as viable businesses, with preference being given to a group of thirteen competitors. This number could fluctuate pursuant to Federated&#x27;s negotiations with various mall landlords and its final decision regarding using former Macy locations for its luxury Bloomingdale&#x27;s operation.

On January 12, 2006, Federated announced its plans to divest May Company&#x27;s Lord &amp; Taylor division (55 stores in 12 states) by the end of 2006. On June 22, 2006, Macy&#x27;s announced that NRDC Equity Partners, LLC would purchase Lord &amp; Taylor for US$1.2 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025), and completed the sale in October 2006.

On September 9, 2006, the former May Company store names Famous-Barr, Filene&#x27;s, Foley&#x27;s, Hecht&#x27;s, The Jones Store, Kaufmann&#x27;s, L. S. Ayres, Marshall Field&#x27;s, Meier &amp; Frank, Robinsons-May, and Strawbridge&#x27;s disappeared as Federated switched most of them to the Macy&#x27;s masthead and a few to the Bloomingdale&#x27;s name. One of the consequences of this rebranding is that several malls have two Macy&#x27;s stores. In downtown Boston, Federated liquidated an acquired Filene&#x27;s because it already had a Macy&#x27;s (formerly a Jordan Marsh) across the street. The two stores have a combined floorspace of more than , more than two-thirds the size of Macy&#x27;s New York City flagship store.

On November 17, 2006, the bridal and formal unit was sold. David&#x27;s Bridal and Priscilla of Boston were sold to Leonard Green &amp; Partners. After Hours Formalwear was sold to Men&#x27;s Wearhouse.

== Operations as Macy&#x27;s, Inc. ==

=== 2000s ===
On February 27, 2007, Federated announced that its board of directors would ask shareholders to change the company&#x27;s name to Macy&#x27;s Group, Inc. By March 28, the company revised its plans for the new name, opting to eventually become Macy&#x27;s, Inc. Federated shareholders approved the revised proposal during the company&#x27;s annual meeting on May 18, 2007.

The name took effect on June 1, 2007. The reasoning for the proposed name change—according to Terry Lundgren, Federated&#x27;s chairman, president, and chief executive officer—hinges on the large-scale conversions throughout the company toward the Macy&#x27;s nameplate. &quot;Today, we are a brand-driven company focused on Macy&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s, not a federation of department stores,&quot; Lundgren said in the company&#x27;s press release heralding the proposed name. Upon the change to Macy&#x27;s Inc., Federated&#x27;s stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from &quot;FD&quot; to &quot;M&quot;, making the new Macy&#x27;s Inc. one of a handful of single-letter ticker symbol companies.

In April 2008, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service said that it might downgrade Macy&#x27;s Inc. bonds to just above junk status. That same month, Fitch Ratings downgraded their bond credit rating to BBB− from BBB, noting a deterioration in the company&#x27;s operating and credit metrics.

The domain &quot;macysinc.com&quot; attracted at least 3 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.

On Wednesday, February 6, 2008, Terry Lundgren announced the localization strategy and the company&#x27;s plan to shed 2,550 jobs. This new localization strategy is known as &quot;My Macy&#x27;s.&quot;

Employees of the Macy&#x27;s North headquarters office in Minneapolis, the Macy&#x27;s Northwest headquarters office in Seattle, and the Macy&#x27;s Midwest headquarters office in St. Louis were given pink slips, as Macy&#x27;s pared its seven regional centers to four. About 40 new jobs were to be created in May as part of the restructuring. By 2009, the company expected to save $100 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) a year from the cuts.

On February 2, 2009, Macy&#x27;s announced the elimination of 7,000 jobs, or 4% of its workforce, and slashed its dividend as it looked to lower expenses as part of a major restructuring. Cincinnati-based Macy&#x27;s Inc. stated that the workforce reduction included positions in offices, stores, and other locations, and the cuts include some unfilled jobs. &quot;Reducing our workforce is an unfortunate outcome of the current economic environment, and I am frustrated that so many of our people will be unable to move forward with us as we proceed into a very exciting future for Macy&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s&quot; said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer.

Macy&#x27;s also got rid of its division structure and integrated its functions into one organization. Macy&#x27;s central buying, merchandise planning, stores senior management and marketing functions merged to its New York City corporate office (formerly Macy&#x27;s East). Corporate-related business functions, such as finance and human resources, will be primarily in Cincinnati. To buy with local consumers in mind, Macy&#x27;s developed a concept called &quot;My Macy&#x27;s&quot;, in which the buyers and planners all look at what the local consumer base is looking for in their local Macy&#x27;s store. This will help bring a better sense of branding, sizing, and marketing to each Macy&#x27;s store nationwide.

Macy&#x27;s Inc. decided to close the Bloomingdale&#x27;s at the Mall of America in Minnesota. Since 1992, Bloomingdale&#x27;s had been one of the 4 anchor stores of the mall, and will be replaced with a $30 million renovation with four new foreign clothing stores.

=== 2010s ===

On October 14, 2013, Macy&#x27;s Inc. announced the decision to open most of their stores for the first time on Thanksgiving Day 2013, breaking a long-standing tradition of 155 years, and joined the ranks of retailers who created Gray Thursday the year before. Its doors opened at 8 p.m. (local time) on the holiday evening, and remained open for 24 hours straight until the close of business on Friday, which is usually about 10 p.m.

, Macy&#x27;s Inc. was valued at US$28 billion.

In September 2015, Macy&#x27;s announced it would close 40 stores, 5% of its total stores in early 2016. It also announced plans to open 6 additional Macy&#x27;s Backstage locations. From 2010 to 2015, Macy&#x27;s had closed 52 stores and opened 12.

=== 2020s ===
In February 2020, Macy&#x27;s announced that its headquarters in downtown Cincinnati would be closing as part of a restructuring with further cutbacks. This news came after a gradual pulling out of the Cincinnati area, with most corporate executives, including the CEO, already at the company&#x27;s other headquarters in New York City. The Cincinnati headquarters building has since been converted to a rental apartment building with 341 units, which is to open in spring 2025.

In November 2021, Macy&#x27;s announced the launch of its digital marketplace, which set to debut in the second half of 2022. Macy&#x27;s will partner with AlixPartners and Mirakl.

In November 2023, it was reported that Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management had offered to buy Macy&#x27;s Inc. for $5.8 billion. Macy&#x27;s rejected the unsolicited offer in January 2024 as undervalued. The investor group increased their offer to $6.6billion two months later.

In February 2024, Macy&#x27;s announced it would close 150 stores by 2026.

== Criticism ==
The conversion of Marshall Field&#x27;s in Chicago was particularly criticized, with many customers boycotting its historic State Street flagship store. The Chicago Tribune continues to report on the poor reception of Macy&#x27;s in Chicago. Pittsburgh customers also strongly resisted the name change from Kaufmann&#x27;s, in part because of the Kaufmann family role in Pittsburgh history, as well as the central store&#x27;s Christmas windows and holiday parade.

<doc id="276762" wikidata="Q1131487" url="?curid=276762" title="Mickey's Revue">
<text>Mickey&#x27;s Revue is a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon, directed by Wilfred Jackson, which features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow performing a song and dance show. The film was delivered to Columbia Pictures on May 12 and released on May 27, 1932. It was the 41st Mickey Mouse film, and the fifth of that year.
A yokel in the audience laughs uproariously at every act; the character would soon be known as Dippy Dawg, and would eventually become a major supporting character, Goofy. Pinto Colvig&#x27;s memorable &quot;witless laugh&quot; could be heard in the previous Mickey Mouse cartoon, &quot;The Barnyard Olympics&quot;, but this is the first time the character can be seen on screen.

==Plot==

In a barnyard concert hall, Mickey Mouse is the conductor for a band of pigs and horses. In a ballet sequence, Minnie Mouse is a flying fairy, held aloft by Horace Horsecollar. Several dancing cows also feature in the performance, and Pluto makes an occasional appearance. In the audience, a witless yokel character annoys the audience by crunching a bag of peanuts and laughing loudly. A pair of tap dancing hounds perform. The yokel laughs again, and other audience members knock him out with a mallet. Mickey and Minnie round out the performance with a duet for piano and horns, assisted by a mischievous litter of kittens.

==Voice cast==
* Pluto: Lee Millar
* Dippy Dawg, Goats: Pinto Colvig

==Home media==
The short was released on December 2, 2002, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black and White&quot;.

==See also==
* Mickey Mouse Revue, an attraction that operated at the Magic Kingdom from 1971 until 1980, and then at Tokyo Disneyland from 1983 until 2009

<text>Silvertown is a district in the London Borough of Newham, in east London, England. It lies on the north bank of the Thames and was historically part of the parishes of West Ham and East Ham, hundred of Becontree, and the historic county of Essex. Since 1965, Silvertown has been part of the London Borough of Newham, a local government district of Greater London. It forms part of the London E16 postcode district along with Canning Town and Custom House.

The area was named after the factories established by Stephen William Silver in 1852. The riverside of central Silvertown continues to be dominated by the Tate &amp; Lyle sugar refinery, with residential developments being built to its east and west.

Central Silvertown features St Marks Church (now Brick Lane Music Hall), London City Airport, and a new community arts and creative space called The Factory Project.

A £3.5 billion redevelopment of part of the district was approved in 2015.

Lyn Brown, previously MP for West Ham until May 2024, was introduced to the House of Lords on 27 January, 2025 as Baroness Brown of Silvertown 

==History==
In 1852 S.W. Silver &amp; Company moved to the area from Greenwich and established a rubber works, originally to make waterproof clothing. This subsequently developed into the works of the India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company, which constructed and laid many submarine cables. By the 1860s a number of manure and chemical works and petroleum storage depots had been set up. In 1864, the area became an ecclesiastical parish of its own, centred on the church of St Mark&#x27;s.

Sugar refiners in the area were joined by Henry Tate in 1877 and Abram Lyle in 1881, whose companies merged in 1921 to form Tate &amp; Lyle. Prior to the merger, which occurred after they had died, the two men were bitter business rivals, although they had never met. Tate &amp; Lyle still has two large refineries in the area.

In 1889 Silver&#x27;s factory was the scene of a twelve-week-long strike by the majority of its 3,000 workers. The strikers were demanding higher pay and were inspired by the recent successes of New Unionism in the East End of London. Management refused to negotiate with the strikers who had immense popular support. Leading figures in the strike included Tom Mann and Eleanor Marx. The workers were eventually starved back to work, with many being victimised for their role. In the aftermath of the strike, Silver&#x27;s declared a half-yearly dividend of 5 per cent. The rest of the industry congratulated Silver&#x27;s management for holding a line against New Unionism.

On 19 January 1917, parts of Silvertown were devastated by a massive TNT explosion at the Brunner-Mond munitions factory, in what is known as the Silvertown explosion. Seventy three people died and hundreds were injured in one of the largest explosions ever experienced in the British Isles.

In the early 20th century the area suffered greatly from road congestion due to being located between the Thames and the Royal Docks, then the largest and one of the busiest dock groups in the world. The area was cut off for much of the time by lifting bridges over dock entrances and level crossings which were closed for up to three-quarters of each hour by train movements. This led in the early 1930s to the construction of the elevated &quot;Silvertown Way&quot;, one of the earliest urban flyovers.

On the first night of The Blitz, Tate and Lyle&#x27;s sugar refinery, John Knight&#x27;s Primrose Soapworks, and the Silvertown Rubber Works were all badly damaged by bombing.

Silver&#x27;s was eventually taken over by the British Tyre and Rubber Co, later known as BTR Industries. The site closed in the 1960s and is now the Thameside Industrial Estate. Another major local employer was the Loders and Nucoline plant at Cairn Mills, a traditional port oleo industry and formerly part of Unilever. This originally milled seeds but later concentrated on production of fats from palm kernel oil.

The area was part of the ancient parishs of West Ham and East Ham, Essex, from the 12th century onwards. The Local Government Act 1894 created East Ham Urban District. West Ham became a county borough in 1900, before merging with East Ham to create the new London Borough of Newham in 1965.

==Regeneration==
Since the closure of the former mainline Silvertown rail station, the small commercial area nearby has suffered, with a loss of shops, post office, local social club, and library. Of the many previous pubs along the Albert Road in Silvertown, only one now remains. Some small pockets of residential development occurred in the 1980s, however since then, little has been done to improve the centre of Silvertown.

Further west, the residential area of Britannia Village was developed in the 1990s in what would come to be known as &quot;West Silvertown&quot;.

On 21 April 2015, Newham Council gave planning permission to The Silvertown Partnership for a new £3.5 billion redevelopment in the area. The development will provide offices, a tech hub, 3,000 new homes and brand experience pavilions. A school, health centre and shops are also included in the plan and a new bridge will cross the Royal Docks to get people to Custom House station and Crossrail. However, little of this proposed redevelopment will benefit the historic centre of residential Silvertown.

The Silvertown Partnership were selected as the development partner to take forward the regeneration of the site. Their plan was to develop the site with homes, restaurants, commercial buildings, local convenience retail facilities, and significant public realm for community use. They predicted that it would provide up to 20,700 new jobs, up to 3,000 homes and contribute £260m each year of gross value to the London economy. The redevelopment is planned to include the restoration of former flour factory Millennium Mills.

In January 2015, the Mayor of London announced an initial £12m of government funding to start work on demolishing part of Millennium Mills and clearing it of asbestos. Prior to this latest development, the area was transformed in the 1970s by the construction of the Thames Barrier, an adjacent park, new housing areas and London City Airport. In the mid-1990s much of the business activity in the area was centred on the brewing firm Bass. In 2007 Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester visited Silvertown, to formally open the new Silvertown Ambulance Station on North Woolwich Road.

The Tate &amp; Lyle Thames Refinery is a safeguarded wharf in the Port of London. It is one of the largest sugar refineries in the world, with a capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum. The Raw Sugar and Refined and Shore Berth jetties include two bulk-handling crane. The terminal commodities are sugar, as dry bulks, and edible and vegetable oils, as liquid bulks: it exports globally and imports from Fiji, Caribbean, Africa and South America.

==Transport==
The nearest Docklands Light Railway station is London City Airport, with Pontoon Dock station also nearby. Access to Silvertown was much improved by an extension of the Docklands Light Railway from Canning Town to Woolwich Arsenal, which opened on 2 December 2005.

The old Silvertown railway station on the North London Line was closed in 2006. A new London Underground station at nearby Custom House built by Crossrail was opened in 2022, adding further public transport access to and from central London, Essex, and direct service to London Heathrow Airport. Locally, this new line used the trackbed of the old North London Line and there is passive provision for a stop serving Silvertown to be built in future.

The London Cable Car connects West Silvertown with the Greenwich peninsula.

London City Airport is located in central Silvertown.

A new bridge to connect West Silvertown with Crossrail&#x27;s Custom House station is one of the features of a £3.5bn redevelopment plan for London&#x27;s Royal Docks.

The Silvertown Tunnel is a road tunnel under the Thames which will open in 2025 and provide a toll route to the Greenwich peninsula.

Transport For London public buses that serve Silvertown include the 473 that runs from Stratford to North Woolwich and the 474 that operates from Canning Town to Manor Park. Both the 473 and 474 make stops at London City Airport. A new route 241 runs between Straford and Pontoon Dock.

Some attempts have been made in recent years to establish bicycling lanes, however ongoing construction and road works limit access and cyclists generally are required to share the road with motor vehicle users.

==Popular culture==
Silvertown is featured in a ballad by Mark Knopfler, titled &quot;Silvertown Blues&quot;, which describes the area as it was before redevelopment.

&#x27;Silvertown&#x27; was the name of a Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang album released in 1989. One song &#x27;Blackfriers Bridge&#x27; mentions Silvertown.

The district also features in Charlie Connelly&#x27;s 2004 book, &quot;Attention All Shipping&quot;. In the first chapter &quot;Sea, Soup and Silvertown&quot; the author describes his grandparents&#x27; flight from the area during The Blitz and the inspiration for the book. The docks and factories of Silvertown also provide the backdrop for his 2015 book &quot;Constance Street&quot; which traces the once thriving community through the lives of 12 women and their struggle for survival during the chaos of the war years.

Melanie McGrath&#x27;s book &quot;Silvertown&quot; is a novelistic account of her grandmother&#x27;s life in the area, where she and her husband ran a cafe.

&quot;The Sugar Girls&quot;, by Duncan Barrett and Nuala Calvi, tells the true stories of women who worked at Tate &amp; Lyle&#x27;s Silvertown factories, and features much detail on the area.

<text>SAP SE (; ) is a European multinational software company based in Walldorf, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The company is the world&#x27;s largest vendor of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.

It was founded in 1972 as a private partnership named &quot;Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung&quot; (&quot;System Analysis Program Development&quot;). SAP GbR became in 1981 fully &quot;Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung&quot; (&quot;Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing&quot;) abbreviated SAP GmbH after a five-year transition period beginning in 1976. In 2005, it further restructured itself as SAP AG. Since 7 July 2014, its corporate structure is that of a pan-European &quot;societas Europaea&quot; (SE); as such, its former German corporate identity is now a subsidiary, SAP Deutschland SE &amp; Co. KG&quot;.&quot; It has regional offices in 180 countries and over 111,961 employees.

SAP is a component of the DAX and Euro Stoxx 50 stock market indices. The company is the largest non-American software company by revenue and the world&#x27;s third-largest publicly traded software company by revenue. As of December 2023, SAP is the largest German company by market capitalization.

== History ==
When Xerox exited the computer hardware manufacturing industry in 1971, it asked IBM to migrate its business systems to IBM technology. As part of IBM&#x27;s compensation for the migration, IBM was given the rights to the Scientific Data Systems (SDS)/SAPE software repository.

Five IBM engineers from the AI department (Dietmar Hopp, Klaus Tschira, Hans-Werner Hector, Hasso Plattner, and Claus Wellenreuther, all from Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg) were working on an enterprise-wide system based on this software, only to be told that it would no longer be necessary. Rather than abandoning the project, they decided to leave IBM Tech and start another company.

In June 1972 they founded the SAP (&quot;System Analysis and Program Development&quot; / &quot;SAPD&quot;) company, as a private partnership under the German Civil Code.

Their first client was the German branch of Imperial Chemical Industries in Östringen, where they developed mainframe programs for payroll and accounting. Instead of storing the data on punch cards mechanically, as IBM did, they stored it locally in the Electronic System while using a common Logical database for all activities of Organization. Therefore, they called their software a real-time system, since there was no need to process the punch cards overnight (for this reason their flagship product carried an R in its name until the late 1990s). This first version was also a standalone software that could be offered to other interested parties.

In 1973, SAP launched its first commercial product, the RF financial accounting system. This system served as the cornerstone in the ongoing development of other software modules of the system that eventually bore the name SAP R/1.

This offered a common system for multiple tasks. This permitted the use of a centralized data storage, improving the maintenance of data. From a technical point of view, therefore, a database was necessary.

In 1976 SAP GmbH Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung (&quot;Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing&quot;) was founded as a sales and support subsidiary. Five years later, the private partnership was dissolved and its rights were passed on to SAP GmbH.The headquarters moved the following year to Walldorf, Germany. 

In 1979, SAP launched SAP R/2, expanding the capabilities of the system to other areas, such as materials management and production planning. 

In 1981, SAP brought a re-designed product to market. However, SAP R/2 did not improve until between 1985 and 1990. 

In 1992, SAP released SAP R/3. SAP developed and released several versions of R/3 through 1995. 

In August 1988 SAP GmbH became SAP AG, and public trading started on 4 November 1988. Shares were listed on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart stock exchanges. In 1995, SAP was included in the German stock index DAX and, on 22 September 2003, SAP was included in the STOXX Europe 50. 

In the mid-1990s, SAP transitioned from mainframe computing to a client–server architecture. In 1996 it began its alliance with the Spanish technology consulting firm Seidor, initiating the expansion of SAP solutions throughout Latin America. 

In 2004, R/3 was replaced with SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) 5.0. Architectural changes were also made to transition customers to a service-oriented architecture. 

The company&#x27;s official name became &quot;SAP AG&quot; (a public limited company) after the 2005 annual general meeting.

In 2006, SAP ERP 6.0 was released. SAP ERP 6.0 is the latest version has since been updated through SAP enhancement packs, the most recent being enhancement package 8 for SAP ERP 6.0 in 2016.

Since 2012 SAP has acquired several companies that sell cloud-based products, with several multi-billion-dollar acquisitions seen by analysts as an attempt to challenge competitor Oracle. In 2016 SAP bought Concur Technologies, a provider of cloud-based travel and expense management software, for $8.3 billion, SAP&#x27;s most expensive purchase to that date. Analysts&#x27; reactions to the purchase were mixed, with Thomas Becker of Commerzbank questioning whether Concur was the right choice for SAP, while Credit Suisse called the acquisition an &quot;aggressive&quot; move.

On 21 May 2014, SAP AG announced during the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders that 99% of the shareholder votes approved the conversion of legal form to a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE) and at the same time, elected the first supervisory board of SAP SE. The conversion of the company&#x27;s legal form would take place upon entry in the commercial register, expected to be in July 2014.

On 7 July 2014, SAP announced it had changed its legal form to a European Company (Societas Europaea, SE). As a result, its German subsidiary was renamed to SAP Deutschland SE &amp; Co. KG. The conversion cost the company approximately €4 million.

In 2014 IBM and SAP began a partnership to sell cloud-based services. Likewise, in 2015, SAP also partnered with HPE to provide secure hybrid cloud-based services running the SAP platform. Both HPE and IBM provide infrastructure services to SAP, and SAP runs its SAP HANA cloud solution on top. SAP has announced additional partnerships with Microsoft in order to give customers tools for data visualization, as well as improved mobile applications.

Since May 2015, the company has dealt with a series of high-profile bribery investigations, including one that led to them paying $3.9 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges over a former executive&#x27;s scheme to bribe Panama government officials in order to win lucrative technology contracts.

SAP exceeded its revenue projections due to the expansion in its cloud business and the success of SAP HANA. The growth can also be partially attributed to the acquisitions of Concur and Fieldglass. Since 2017, SAP is a founding member of the EU Cloud Code of Conduct. Since May 2021 SAP has listed selected Cloud Service adherent to the EU Cloud Code of Conduct as one of the first Cloud Service Providers.

In July 2017 allegations were made that SAP had been involved in business transactions with the controversial and politically influential Gupta family in South Africa. SAP was accused of paying CAD House, a Gupta-controlled company, R100 million in order to secure a Transnet deal. SAP denied the allegations, claiming that the money was paid as &quot;an extension of the sales force&quot;, despite CAD House having no prior SAP experience. The dealings of the Gupta family with SAP were revealed in a widely publicized e-mail leak. As a consequence of the allegations SAP launched an investigation that led to four of its South African managers being placed on administrative leave along with the seizure of their mobile phones and computers. Claas Kuehnemann was named as acting managing director for Africa while the investigation continued. On 26 October 2017 SAP announced that it had voluntarily reported itself to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a possible violation of US law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), related to the South African bribery allegations. SAP&#x27;s own investigation, conducted by law firm Baker McKenzie, revealed that SAP had paid $7.7 million in commissions to third-parties linked to the Gupta family while securing contracts worth $48 million with Transnet and Eskom.

The company announced plans in 2016 to invest heavily into technology relating to the Internet of things (IoT) as part of a strategy to capitalize on the growth in that market. For that purpose, €2 billion is planned for investment in relevant sectors by the end of 2020. SAP will also launch a new product line called SAP IoT, which &quot;will combine large amounts of data from things connected to the Internet with machine learning and SAP&#x27;s real-time database S/4 HANA.&quot;

In 2018 and in an ongoing court battle, Teradata accused SAP of IP theft and fraudulent behaviour. In 2021, in the German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, additional claims were made of questionable behaviour with regards to SAP&#x27;s funding of researchers at the University of Mannheim - who were in effect paid by SAP to investigate competitors technology. In a later article, Der Spiegel magazine maintained that SAP had been neglectful in maintaining strict governance for years. In June 2022 the German business magazine Manager Magazin published an article stating the management style of the leadership might be responsible for an increased compliance risk.

On 29 January 2019 SAP announced plans to cut approximately 4,000 positions at the company in a strategic plan to shift to more modern cloud-based technologies such as blockchain, quantum computing, machine learning, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence.

In February 2019 SAP was accused of &#x27;improper conduct&#x27; linked to state contracts in Kenya and Tanzania. An anonymous whistle-blower claims, through a firm of attorneys, that SAP used Twenty Third Century Systems (TTCS) to bribe officials at the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) to win a US$6.6 million enterprise resource planning software tender that involved the provision of software licenses and services.

In 2021 SAP admitted in a United States court that it exported software to firms in Iran, contrary to US sanctions against Iran, which led to a fine of $8 million.

On 13 April 2021 SAP announced the formation of the joint venture &quot;SAP Fioneer&quot;, a dedicated Financial Services Industry (FSI) Unit between SAP and investment company Dediq GmbH. Dediq GmbH invested over €500 million in the newly formed unit and received an 80 percent share in return. SAP brought its products, organizational units and the sales network into the business and holds 20 percent of the shares.

In May 2022, multiple claims were made of bullying and sexual harassment within the company, with many cases of unwanted advances by senior male managers on female colleagues. When complaints were made or information made available, HR were found to be unhelpful or hostile. For example, in one case a female employee was groped by a male manager in Sydney while at a company event, but he was never brought to account. In another case, a female employee was sexually targeted by a manager and asked to keep her web camera on during the day. She then complained and was placed under &quot;performance management&quot; - a precursor to being asked to leave the company. Several female executives, including the Co-CEO left the company, adding to concerns that women were negatively treated, despite SAP then hiring several other senior women from Microsoft.

In 2024 after investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, SAP was ordered to pay $220 million to resolve violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in South Africa, Indonesia, Tanzania, Malawi, Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Azerbaijan. It paid bribes to officials in state-owned enterprises to gain government contracts. It entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement, paying a criminal penalty of $118.8 million and an administrative forfeiture of $103,396,765. In South Africa SAP used third-party intermediaries to acquire tenders from various state-owned entities, including Transnet, the South African Revenue Service, the City of Johannesburg, Eskom and the Department of Water and Sanitation. In March 2024, SAP agreed to pay R500 million as part of an agreement with South Africa&#x27;s Special Investigating Unit. The agreement indemnifies them against further financial claims related to the bribery, but does not absolve any parties from criminal prosecution.

On September 3, 2024 it was announced that CTO and Executive Board Member Juergen Mueller reached a mutual agreement to leave the company by the end of the month due to incident of inappropriate behavior at a company event. Following the news of this incident it was reported on September 13, 2024 that German prosecutors have opened a formal investigation of sexual harassment between him and the female employee. 

== Acquisitions ==

Since 1991, SAP has acquired more than 70 companies.

== Products ==

As well as its main ERP products, the company also sells database software and technology (particularly its own brand, SAP HANA) and cloud-engineered systems. It sells other ERP software products such as:
* Human capital management (HCM) software 
* Customer relationship management (CRM) software 
* Enterprise performance management (EPM) software 
* Product lifecycle management (PLM) software 
* Supplier relationship management (SRM) software 
* Supply chain management (SCM) software 
* Business technology platform (BTP) software 
* The SAP AppGyver programming environment

== Finances ==

For the fiscal year 2017 SAP reported earnings of €4 billion, with an annual revenue of €23.5 billion, an increase of 6.3% over the previous fiscal cycle. SAP&#x27;s shares traded at over US$154 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$180 billion in December 2023, making it the largest German company by market capitalization.

The key trends for SAP are (as at the financial year ending 31 March):
== Corporate structure and ownership ==
SAP had the following ownership structure in early 2024:


SAP uses a two-tier structure of boards with an executive board and a supervisory board. In October 2019 Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein were appointed as co-CEOs of SAP. In April 2020 it was announced that Jennifer Morgan will leave SAP and Christian Klein will continue to operate as the sole CEO, citing that the current environment of the COVID-19 recession requires &quot;companies to take swift, determined action which is best supported by a very clear leadership structure&quot;.

The majority of the company&#x27;s employees are in Germany and United States. About 20,000 employees are based in Germany and about 19,311 employees are based in the United States.

45 employee representatives were elected in 2022 to the SAP &quot;SE Works Council&quot;, including 15 candidates from the Ver.di and IG Metall trade union lists. They represent 17,000 employees of Germany. 
Headquarters is responsible for overall management as well as core engineering activities related to product development. Worldwide customer support is not provided by the field organizations but by a unified organization called Active Global Support (AGS).

The company also encourages employees to volunteer through social sabbaticals, sending teams of people to different countries to aid non-profits. SAP employees have volunteered in China, India, Brazil, and South Africa.
== Research and development ==
SAP Labs are research and development locations that develop and improve SAP core products. SAP Labs are strategically located in high-tech clusters around the globe.

The four most prominent labs of SAP SE are located in Germany, Japan, Israel and the US. Labs Walldorf was founded in 1972 and became SAP&#x27;s primary location. At the beginning, the focus of SAP&#x27;s expansion was entering highly developed IT markets; in 1993, Palo Alto became a part of SAP Labs. Aiming to acquire talented employees, SAP opened another lab in Bangalore in 2003.

SAP Research is the global technology research unit of SAP SE with a network of 21 research locations worldwide. Each center is located in close proximity to an SAP development center or on a university campus. The group significantly contributes to SAP&#x27;s product portfolio and extends its leading position in the market by identifying and shaping emerging IT trends and generating breakthrough technologies through applied research. In contrast to SAP&#x27;s product groups and development labs that work on new functions and releases, its researchers explore opportunities that have not yet been developed into products.

<doc id="276774" wikidata="Q853847" url="?curid=276774" title="Tinker Bell">
<text>Tinker Bell is a fictional character from J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1904 play &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and its 1911 novelisation &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;. She has appeared in a variety of film and television adaptations of the Peter Pan stories, in particular the 1953 animated Walt Disney picture &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. She also appears in the official 2006 sequel &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot; by Geraldine McCaughrean commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital as well as the &quot;Peter and the Starcatchers&quot; book series by Ridley Pearson and Dave Barry. 

At first only a supporting character described by her creator as &quot;a common fairy&quot;, her animated incarnation was a hit and has since become a widely recognized unofficial mascot of The Walt Disney Company, next to the official mascot of Mickey Mouse.

==In original play and novel==
Barrie described Tinker Bell as a fairy who mended pots and kettles, an actual tinker of the fairy folk. Her speech consists of the sounds of a tinkling bell, which is understandable only to those familiar with the language of the fairies.

Though sometimes ill-tempered, jealous, vindictive and inquisitive, she is also helpful and kind to Peter. The extremes in her personality are explained in the story by the fact that a fairy&#x27;s size prevents her from holding more than one feeling at a time, so when she is angry she has no counterbalancing compassion. At the end of the novel, when Peter flies back to find an older Wendy, &quot;when she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said, &#x27;Who is Tinker Bell?&#x27;&quot; Try as she might, nothing she said helped Peter remember Tinker Bell. Finally, Peter said, &#x27;There are such a lot of them, I expect she is no more.&#x27; The narrator comments that he expected Peter was right, &quot;that fairies don&#x27;t live long, but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them.&quot; 

In the first draft of the play, she is called Tippy-toe, but became Tinker Bell in the later drafts and final version.

==On stage==
In the original stage productions, Tinker Bell was represented on stage by a darting light &quot;created by a small mirror held in the hand off-stage and reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp&quot;, and her voice was &quot;a collar of bells and two special ones that Barrie brought from Switzerland&quot;. However, a &#x27;Jane (or Jenny) Wren&#x27; was listed among the cast on the programmes as playing Tinker Bell; this was a joke which also helped with the mystique of the fairy character and fooled H.M. Inspector of Taxes, who sent Jane Wren a tax demand.

Originally, no fairy dust was mentioned in the play, but Barrie added to the script the necessity to sprinkle it to enable the children to fly because &quot;so many children tried [to fly] from their beds and needed surgical attention.&quot;

In the musical version of the play, she was also represented by a darting light, accompanied by a celesta. Her favourite insult (as in Barrie&#x27;s play) is &quot;You silly ass!&quot;, which the audience learns to recognise because it is always represented by the same motif: four notes (presumably one for each syllable of the phrase), followed by a growl on the bassoon.

==In film==
Film adaptations provided the first vocal effects for the character, whether through sound, such as musical expressions or the sound of a tinkling bell, or human speech.

===&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1924)===
In the 1924 film, Tinker Bell was played by Virginia Browne Faire.

===&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953) and other Disney media===
===&quot;Hook&quot;===
In the 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;, Tinker Bell is portrayed by Julia Roberts. After taking the now-adult Peter to Neverland to rescue his children, Tinker Bell persuades Captain Hook to give her three days to restore Peter&#x27;s lost memories (including his abilities to fly, fight, and crow) in order to ensure a fair fight between Peter and Hook. After Peter&#x27;s memory is restored, Tinker Bell &quot;wishes&quot; herself into a human-size woman to share a kiss with Peter. After Peter returns to London, Tinker Bell appears to him one last time on the Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens to tell him that she will always love him.

In this version, Tinker Bell is portrayed as a winged, six-inch-tall tomboyish sprite with a red &quot;pixie cut&quot; hairstyle. She wears a ragged leather tunic with matching shorts and carries a dagger strapped to her leg. Only while flying does she appear as the traditional ball of light. Tinker Bell displays strength beyond all proportion to her size and is capable of picking up and carrying a grown man, as well as wielding a human sword while flying (giving the impression that the sword is hovering in mid-air). This is also the first interpretation in which Tinker Bell has the ability to transform into a human-size version of herself. &quot;Hook&quot; subverts Tinker Bell&#x27;s canon by having her survive well into the modern era, whereas the original novel states that fairies are naturally short-lived. The implication of the novel was that Tinker Bell died shortly after the Darling children&#x27;s adventures, and that Peter forgot her.

===&quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2003)===
In the 2003 film &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, P.J. Hogan originally planned to use a computer-generated version of the character, but instead used Ludivine Sagnier in combination with digital models and effects to take advantage of the actress&#x27;s expressions.

=== &quot;Peter Pan &amp; Wendy&quot; (2023) ===
In the 2023 film &quot;Peter Pan &amp; Wendy&quot;, Yara Shahidi portrayed Tinker Bell. This marked the first time a person of color portrayed the character, who had been previously portrayed by white actors. This adaptation followed in the footsteps of Disney&#x27;s casting of the African American actress Halle Bailey to play Ariel in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (2023).

=== &quot;Peter Pan&#x27;s Neverland Nightmare&quot; (2025) ===
Tinker Bell appears in the 2025 horror film &quot;Peter Pan&#x27;s Neverland Nightmare&quot; which portrays her as a human instead of a fairy. In this version she is addicted to heroin, whilst mistaking it for fairy dust. She and Captain Hook help Peter Pan kidnap kids.

==Other literary works==

===&quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot;===
Tinker Bell returns in the official sequel &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot;. When Wendy and the rest of the group reach Neverland and ask Peter where she is, he replies that he does not know anyone by the name Tinker Bell, which is explained as him not remembering her after she died. She is mentioned by Wendy and the rest of the Lost Boys to Fireflyer, a silly blue fairy, who when he reaches the top of Neverpeak, makes the wish to meet her. When they open Captain Hook&#x27;s treasure chest, among other things, Tinker Bell is seen inside it to Fireflyer&#x27;s joy. Initially, Tinker Bell does not like him, but eventually she comes to see that Fireflyer is not as bad as he seems to be. In the end, they get married and start selling dreams to the Roamers, previous Lost Boys that have been outcast by Peter, while having many adventures.

===&quot;Peter and the Starcatchers&quot;===
In the Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson &quot;Peter and the Starcatchers&quot; book series, Tinker Bell makes her first appearance at the end of the first novel. Originally, she was a green and yellow coloured bird who was put in a bag of starstuff, turning her into a fairy. Molly&#x27;s father, the famous starcatcher Lord Leonard Aster, made her Peter&#x27;s guardian and she follows him on all of his adventures. She doesn&#x27;t like being called a fairy and would much rather be called &quot;birdwoman&quot; because of her origins. She is very protective of Peter, and hates his paying attention to any other female. She can be very impolite to others (only Peter is able to understand her perfectly, and most of the time he does not reveal what she says about others, because they are mostly insults). She is also able to emit a very bright light, which she uses as an attack against other creatures, especially Lord Ombra, one of the main villains of the series.

===&quot;Cheshire Crossing&quot;===
In the Andy Weir and Sarah Andersen &quot;Cheshire Crossing&quot; series, Tinker &quot;Tink&quot; Bell firstly appears alongside Peter as they attempt to rescue captured fairies from Captain Hook and the Wicked Witch of the West, with Peter being captured and Tink fleeing to get Wendy&#x27;s help, alongside that of Dorothy Gale and Alice Liddell, providing the latter two with fairy dust to fly. Later, after Dorothy is captured, Tink frees her and goes to Castle West to warn Jack the Knave of Hearts of the incoming flying pirate ship, preventing the Cheshire Cat from eating her when they attempt to do so. Later, after the Witch defeats Mary Poppins in battle, Tink lends Poppins her power against the Witch as Poppins utters &quot;Say hello to my little friend!&quot;, leaving them evenly matched. Later, after the Witch has been defeated, Alice places Peter (now shrunken to Tink&#x27;s size and having matured due to consuming size-altering berries in Wonderland) next to Tink, having recognized her as being in love with him, and after being complimented by Peter as to her appearance, the pair kiss.

===&quot;Coira in Everland&quot;===
In the book by Kirk Clendinning, Coira in Everland, Tinker &quot;Tink&quot; Bell has isolated herself from the other fairies and girls in Everland, partly due to her anger and humiliation with Pan, deep in the forest within a hollow tree. Coira, who has lost her dream pool, and so too is estranged from the community, finds Tinker Bell and they become fast friends, sharing Pan-like adventures together. When the Mairbh Queen threatens to destroy Everland by enslaving fairies and children to gather nectar so that she can make enough fairy dust to escape from Everland, Tink, Coira, a mauve fairy named Chandler and mysterious boy work together to defeat her and restore Everland to normalcy.

==On television==
Tinker Bell was voiced or portrayed by:
* Sumi Shimamoto in the 1989 anime series &quot;The Adventures of Peter Pan&quot;.
* Debi Derryberry in the 1990 Fox animated program &quot;Peter Pan and the Pirates&quot;.
* Keira Knightley in the 2011 &quot;Neverland&quot; miniseries.
* Rose McIver in season three (2013) of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot;, debuting in the episode &quot;Quite a Common Fairy&quot;. 
* In &quot;Peter Pan Live!&quot;, a TV production of the musical broadcast by NBC in 2014, a computer-generated version of Tinker Bell was used, controlled live by a technician. 
* Paloma Faith in the 2015 &quot;Peter &amp; Wendy&quot; ITV film.

In &quot;World of Winx&quot;, Tinker Bell is a powerful fairy from the world of dreams (also called Neverland) and a friend of Peter Pan. When Peter Pan eventually left her for Wendy Darling, she became dark and cold, turning into the evil Queen.

==In art==

In addition to the illustrations in the original editions of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell has also been depicted by fantasy artists such as Brian Froud and Myrea Pettit. She also appears in the edition of &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot; illustrated by David Wyatt.

A bronze sculpture of Tinker Bell by London artist Diarmuid Byron O&#x27;Connor was commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to whom Barrie bequeathed the copyright to the character, to be added to his original four-foot statue of Peter Pan, wresting a thimble from Peter&#x27;s finger. The figure has a wingspan and is tall. She was unveiled on 29 September 2005 by Sophie, Countess of Wessex. 

In 2009, a waxwork of Tinker Bell (the museum&#x27;s &quot;smallest figure of all time&quot; at was created at Madame Tussauds, London.

==At Disneyland==
Five people individually played Tinker Bell at Disneyland California from 1961 to 2005. Multiple alternate people, women and men, were playing the role at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland after 2005. Tinker Bell didn&#x27;t start flying in Florida until 1985.
* 1958 (Hollywood Bowl) and 1961–1964 (Disneyland): Tiny Kline
* Summer 1964: Mimi Zerbini
* 1965–1982: Judy Kaye
* 1983–2005: Gina Rock (trained three girls to replace her when she retired) 
* 1985–2005: Patty Rock (backup for Gina Rock 1985-1995, then split flying time until 2005)

<doc id="276776" wikidata="Q478327" url="?curid=276776" title="Rattle and Hum">
<text>Rattle and Hum is a hybrid live/studio album by Irish rock band U2, and a companion rockumentary film directed by Phil Joanou. The album was produced by Jimmy Iovine and was released on 10 October 1988, while the film was distributed by Paramount Pictures and was released on 27 October 1988. Following the breakthrough success of the band&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, the &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; project captures their continued experiences with American roots music on the Joshua Tree Tour, further incorporating elements of blues rock, folk rock, and gospel music into their sound. A collection of new studio tracks, live performances, and cover songs, the project includes recordings at Sun Studio in Memphis and collaborations with Bob Dylan, B. B. King, and Harlem&#x27;s New Voices of Freedom gospel choir.

Although &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; was intended to represent the band paying tribute to legendary musicians, some critics accused U2 of trying to place themselves amongst the ranks of such artists. Critical reception to both the album and the film was mixed; one &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor spoke of the album&#x27;s &quot;excitement&quot;; another described it as &quot;misguided and bombastic&quot;. The film grossed just $8.6 million, but the album was a commercial success, reaching number one in several countries and selling 14 million copies. The lead single &quot;Desire&quot; became the band&#x27;s first UK number-one song while reaching number three in the US. Facing creative stagnation and a critical backlash to &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image.

==History==
While in Hartford during the Joshua Tree Tour in 1987, U2 met film director Phil Joanou who made an unsolicited pitch to the band to make a feature-length documentary about the tour. Joanou suggested they hire Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, or George Miller to direct the film. Joanou met the band again in Dublin to discuss the plans and again in France in September before the band chose him as director. The movie was originally titled &quot;U2 in the Americas&quot; and the band planned to film in Chicago and Buenos Aires later in the year. It was later decided that the Chicago venue was not suitable, and instead U2 used the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver to film. Following the success of &quot;Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;, which had been filmed in Denver four years earlier, the band hoped that &quot;lightning might strike twice&quot;. With production problems and estimated costs of $1.2 million the band cancelled the plans for December concerts in South America. At the suggestions of concert promoter Barry Fey, the band instead booked Sun Devil Stadium at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, the same city where the Joshua Tree Tour began.

The movie is a rockumentary, which was initially financed by the band and intended to be screened in a small number of cinemas as an independent film. After going over budget, the film was bought by Paramount Pictures and released in theatres in 1988, before arriving on video in 1989. It was produced by Michael Hamlyn and directed by Joanou. Paul Wasserman served as the publicist. It incorporates live footage with studio outtakes and band interviews. The album is a mix of live material and new studio recordings that furthers the band&#x27;s experimentation with American music styles and recognises many of their musical influences. It was produced by Jimmy Iovine and also released in 1988.

The title, &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, is taken from a lyric from &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;, the fourth track on &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. The image used for the album cover and movie poster, depicting Bono shining a spotlight on Edge as he plays, was inspired by a scene in the live performance of &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; recorded in the film and album, but was recreated in a stills studio and photographed by Anton Corbijn. Several vinyl copies have the message &quot;We Love You A.L.K.&quot; etched into side one, a reference to the band&#x27;s production manager Anne Louise Kelly, who would be the subject of another secret dedication message on several CD copies of the band&#x27;s later album, &quot;Pop&quot;.

==Studio recordings==

Bono said &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot; was in part as a tribute to writer Sam Shepard, who had released a book entitled &quot;Hawk Moon&quot;. Bono also said that the band mixed the song 269 times. This was thought to be a joke for years until it was confirmed by guitarist the Edge in &quot;U2 by U2&quot;, who said that they spent three weeks mixing the song. He also contradicted Bono&#x27;s assertion about Shepard, saying that Hawkmoon is a place in Rapid City, South Dakota, in the midwestern United States.

&quot;Angel of Harlem&quot; is a horn-filled tribute to Billie Holiday. The bass-heavy &quot;God Part II&quot; is a sequel of sorts to John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;God&quot;.

The lead single, &quot;Desire&quot;, sports a Bo Diddley beat. During the Joshua Tree tour, in mid-November 1987, Bono and Bob Dylan met in Los Angeles; together they wrote a song called &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; which later became &quot;Love Rescue Me&quot;. Dylan sang lead vocals on the original recording, a version which Bono called &quot;astonishing&quot;, but Dylan later asked U2 not to use it citing commitments to The Traveling Wilburys. The live performance of &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; (recorded with a full church choir) is a gospel song. &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; is a blues rocker featuring B. B. King on guitar and vocals.

U2 recorded &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot;, &quot;Love Rescue Me&quot; and &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, where Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash and many others also recorded. They also recorded an unreleased version of &quot;She&#x27;s a Mystery to Me&quot; and Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, which appeared on &quot;&quot;. The band started writing &quot;Heartland&quot; in 1984 during &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; sessions, and it was worked on during &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; sessions. All of the studio tracks apart from &quot;Heartland&quot; were performed in concert on the Lovetown Tour, which began almost a year after &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;″s release.

In addition to the nine studio tracks that comprised one half of the double album, a number of additional recordings from the &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; sessions would be released on various singles and side projects. &quot;Hallelujah Here She Comes&quot; was released as a B-side to &quot;Desire&quot;, and &quot;A Room at the Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was released as a B-side to &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot;. Covers were released as B-sides for the rest of the singles—an abbreviated cover of Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Barefoot&quot; would be released as a B-side to &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; (the full version would see release on the 12&quot; version of the single and on CD on the 1994 soundtrack album to &quot;Threesome&quot;), while &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; would be released as the B-sides to &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;. A cover of &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; recorded with Maria McKee would not be released until 1992&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; single; a version of the soul classic &quot;Everybody Loves a Winner&quot; by William Bell, also recorded with McKee, would eventually be released on the 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;.

Studio versions of &quot;She&#x27;s a Mystery to Me&quot; (a Bono/Edge composition that would eventually be recorded and released by Roy Orbison), Bruce Cockburn&#x27;s &quot;If I Had a Rocket Launcher&quot;, Percy Sledge&#x27;s &quot;Warm and Tender Love&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love With You&quot;, while recorded, have yet to be released. (A solo Bono cover of the Elvis Presley classic would be released on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; album, however.) A cover of the Woody Guthrie song &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; was also recorded during these sessions for eventual inclusion on the cover album &quot;&quot;. Lastly, a cover of &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; was recorded and released for the first &quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot; album, released at the end of 1987.

==Live performances==

The band chose to film the black-and-white footage over two nights at Denver&#x27;s McNichols Sports Arena on 7 and 8 November 1987. They chose the city following the success of their &quot;U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; video which was filmed in Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver in 1983. The Edge said, &quot;We thought lightning might strike twice&quot;. The first night&#x27;s performance disappointed the group, with Bono finding that the cameras infringed on his ability to play to the crowd. The second Denver show was far more successful and seven songs from the show are used in the film, and three on the album.

Hours before the second Denver performance, an IRA bomb killed eleven people at a Remembrance Day ceremony in the Northern Irish town of Enniskillen (see Remembrance Day Bombing). During a performance of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, which appears on the film, Bono condemned the violence in a furious mid-song rant in which he yelled, &quot;Fuck the revolution!&quot; The performance was so powerful that the band said they were not sure the song should have been used in the film. After watching the film, they considered not playing the song on future tours.

Colour outdoor concert footage is from the band&#x27;s Tempe, Arizona shows on 19 and 20 December 1987. Tickets were sold for US$5 each and both nights sold out within days. The set was different each night with the band throwing in some rarely performed songs, including &quot;Out of Control&quot;, &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, and &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;. For the latter, all four members played at the front of the stage, each under a large spotlight.

The album opens with a live cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. Its inclusion on the album was intended by the band to reflect the confusion of The Joshua Tree Tour and their new-found superstar status. Bono opens &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; with this statement: &quot;This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. We&#x27;re stealing it back&quot;.

The album contains a live version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;. The performance is from the band&#x27;s impromptu &quot;Save the Yuppies&quot; concert in Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco, California on 11 November 1987. The video intersperses the performance of the song with footage from the band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Pride&quot; from the same show, during which Bono spray-painted &quot;Rock and Roll Stops the Traffic&quot; on the Vaillancourt Fountain. This caused a bit of controversy, and ultimately, the band paid to repair the damage and publicly apologised for the incident. The phrase &quot;Rock and Roll Stops the Traffic&quot; reappeared 18 years later in the video &quot;All Because of You&quot; when an unnamed fan appeared with the sign at 1:55 in the video. It also reappeared in February 2009, when the band played on the rooftop of the BBC Radio studios in Langham Place.

Dennis Bell, director of New York gospel choir The New Voices of Freedom, recorded a demo of a gospel version of &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;. While in Glasgow in late July during the Joshua Tree Tour, Rob Partridge of Island Records played the demo for the band. In late September, U2 rehearsed with Bell&#x27;s choir in a Harlem church, and a few days later they performed the song together at U2&#x27;s Madison Square Garden concert. Footage of the rehearsal is featured in the movie, while the Madison Square Garden performance appears on the album. After the church rehearsal, U2 walked around the Harlem neighbourhood where they came across blues duo, Satan and Adam, playing in the street. A 40-second clip of them playing their composition, &quot;Freedom for My People&quot;, appears on both the movie and the album.

During &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, Bono explains that the song is an attack on apartheid. &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; is an excerpt of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s famous Woodstock performance in 1969. The noise of the crowd was sampled extensively by The KLF for &#x27;the Stadium House Trilogy&#x27; of singles on their 1991 album &quot;The White Room&quot;.

Alternative live concert footage captured for the film in other cities during the 1987 tour (but ultimately not used for the final cut of the film) included:

*Foxboro, Massachusetts, Foxboro Stadium, 22 September 1987
*Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, JFK Stadium, 25 September 1987
*New York, NY, Madison Square Garden, 28 September 1987
*Long Island, New York, Rehearsals on a beach, 19 October 1987
*Boston, Massachusetts, Boston Garden, 18 September 1987 (color footage)

==Reception==
===Album===

The album divided critics when it was released in 1988. Some reviewers panned it, feeling that U2 were making a deliberate and pretentious attempt at rock and roll renown. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;mess&quot; that exuded &quot;sincere egomania&quot;, and said the &quot;band&#x27;s self-importance got in the way&quot; of their ambition for the album. He said it was plagued by the group&#x27;s &quot;attempts to grab every mantle in the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame&quot; and that each one was &quot;embarrassing in a different way&quot;. David Stubbs of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said that &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; &quot;lacks cohesion&quot; and &quot;is musically, stylistically confused&quot;. He criticised Bono&#x27;s &quot;reverential nods to the great white heroes of rock&quot; and the band&#x27;s &quot;homages to the bluesmen and gospel greats&quot;. Thom Duffy of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said that &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; is &quot;greatly in need of a focal point&quot; and &quot;often sounds like an over-reaching attempt to claim chunks of pop history as [U2&#x27;s] own story&quot;. He believed the group had &quot;merely celebrated its own ascension into the pop history books... and little more&quot;. Tom Carson from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it an &quot;awful record&quot; by &quot;almost any rock-and-roll fan&#x27;s standards&quot;, and said the group&#x27;s failure did not &quot;sound attributable to pretensions so much as to monumental know-nothingism&quot;. Fellow &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was more complimentary, calling the record &quot;looser and faster than anything they&#x27;ve recorded since their first live mini-LP&quot;. David Browne of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said the album&#x27;s &quot;scope and disjointedness&quot; recalled double albums such as &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; or &quot;The Beatles&quot;, but that until it aged as well as those records, &quot;&#x27;Rattle and Hum&#x27; just prattles and numbs&quot;. Andrew Means of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; thought the album was &quot;no substitute&quot; for the &quot;exhilaration and conviction&quot; of the Joshua Tree Tour. He believed that Bono&#x27;s passion on record was not &quot;quite as mesmerizing as it is on stage&quot; and that the group&#x27;s new material did not &quot;add significantly&quot; to their message or image. Lynden Barber of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called it &quot;an ambitious project, and the result is almost inevitably a mixed bag&quot;. He lamented the songs that presented the band&#x27;s Christianity &quot;as a fait accompli&quot;, as well as their proclivity for &quot;jams around a couple of chords substituting themselves for considered song-writing&quot;. A reviewer for Knight-Ridder News said, &quot;this double-album boondoggle manages to make the band sound like quintessential overreachers&quot;.

Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Anthony DeCurtis said that the record succeeded at capping U2&#x27;s rise to stardom &quot;on a raucous, celebratory note&quot;, finding it to be &quot;most enjoyable when the band relaxes and allows itself to stretch without self-consciously reaching for the stars&quot;. DeCurtis ultimately deemed it a &quot;tad calculated in its supposed spontaneity&quot; and said it demonstrated &quot;U2&#x27;s force but devot[ed] too little attention to the band&#x27;s vision&quot;. In a rave review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn called &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; a &quot;frequently remarkable album&quot; that more than matched &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, and he credited U2 for reviving the &quot;idealism and craft of [rock&#x27;s] finest moments&quot;. J. D. Considine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said that the album&#x27;s songs &quot;draw upon every musical strength U2 has developed over the years&quot; and that the &quot;sheer muscular physicality of its sound&quot; set &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; apart from its predecessors. He said that despite the record being &quot;occasionally pretentious&quot;, the group &quot;never seems out of its depth&quot; amongst the guest artists. Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; said, &quot;U2 has never sounded better or bolder&quot;, calling &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;: &quot;the best live rock album ever made. The record, in every sense, of their lives&quot;. &quot;Hot Press&quot; reviewer Bill Graham said it was U2&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious record&quot; yet, while John Mackie of &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; said it &quot;should consolidate the band&#x27;s stature as the Beatles of the late &#x27;80s&quot;. Cliff Radel of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; said that &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; &quot;proves the achievements of the band&#x27;s previous album... were no accident&quot;, and that it demonstrated the group&#x27;s ability to create &quot;highly charged songs in the studio and on stage&quot;. In the UK, Robin Denselow of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that &quot;the whole sounds far greater than the sum of the decidedly variable parts&quot;. The review found the cover songs to be the weakest material but judged &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; overall to be a &quot;solid, versatile piece of work&quot; that &quot;leaves much of the best until last&quot;. Stuart Baillie of &quot;NME&quot; gave it a positive 8/10 review. Contentiously, his review replaced a much more negative 4/10 review by Mark Sinker, in which he described it as &quot;the worst album by a major band in years&quot;. It was pulled by &quot;NME&quot; editor Alan Lewis, as it was feared that criticism of U2 would affect the magazine&#x27;s circulation; Sinker resigned in protest.

At the end of 1988, &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; was voted the 21st-best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. In other critics&#x27; lists of the year&#x27;s top albums, it was ranked number one by &quot;HUMO&quot;, second by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Hot Press&quot;, 17th by &quot;OOR&quot;, 23rd by &quot;NME&quot;, and 47th by &quot;Sounds&quot;.

===Film===

According to a &quot;USA Today&quot; survey of reviews at the time of the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; had an average review score of 64/100. According to review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 62%. Roger Ebert panned the film as a &quot;mess&quot;, saying the concert footage was poorly lit and did not show the audience enough, and that the band being &quot;deliberately inarticulate&quot; in interview segments was &quot;not cute&quot;. His review partner Gene Siskel was more complimentary, praising the group&#x27;s performance with the Harlem gospel choir as &quot;powerful and emotional&quot; and calling Bono&#x27;s statements during &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; the film&#x27;s highlight. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;an exercise in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll hagiography&quot; and &quot;a fanzine on celluloid&quot;, and said that despite its &quot;stunning look&quot;, the film came across as &quot;stagy and overproduced&quot;. He said that the band&#x27;s &quot;attempts to place themselves in the rock continuum are fairly strenuous and more than a little presumptuous&quot;. Joyce Millman of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; described it as a &quot;tediously pious and self-important&quot; film that &quot;successfully captured everything the faithful love, and we pagans loathe, about the biggest band of the &#x27;80s&quot;. She said the film &quot;does nothing to pierce the band&#x27;s vagueness&quot; and that they were upstaged by King and the Harlem gospel choir. Millman judged that the cinematography&#x27;s &quot;gargantuan pomposity... perhaps unintentionally&quot; personified &quot;the essence of U2&quot;. Gary Graff of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; called the film &quot;a conceptual mess that lacks focus and flow&quot;, and said that it neither chronicles the band&#x27;s breakout success of 1987 adequately nor offers additional insight into the band. He said that &quot;many of the individual components of [the film] are excellent&quot; but that Joanou failed to tie them together. Carrie Rickey of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said, &quot;Self-indulgent to the point of absurdity, &quot;U2 Rattle and Hum&quot; might be the silliest concert film ever made.&quot; She said it compared unfavourably to other concert movies due to its lack of narrative, and that Joanou&#x27;s reverence for U2 bordered on &quot;unintentional hilarity&quot;, adding, &quot;Rob Reiner and company couldn&#x27;t do a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; on this; &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; is already a parody.&quot; Joanou himself called the picture &quot;pretentious&quot;.

Michael MacCambridge of the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; disagreed with the film&#x27;s detractors, calling it a &quot;very good and at times excellent concert movie&quot; whose &quot;studied avoidance of drifting into self-parody&quot; distinguished it from predecessors and headed off comparisons to &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. MacCambridge enjoyed the black-and-white footage of the band &quot;in the middle of becoming legend&quot; and their scenes with King and the Harlem gospel choir, but thought the switch to colour footage interrupted the film&#x27;s &quot;pace and momentum&quot;. David Silverman of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that Joanou &quot;steadily brings the viewer into a relationship with the band and brings an understanding to the new music&quot;, while &quot;provid[ing] an innovative, fast-paced insight&quot; to U2. Silverman praised the documentary scenes with the individual band members and the &quot;beautiful artistic&quot; performance footage, and said the director &quot;succeeded in bringing U2 to the screen in a creative, introspective and exciting film that will add to the legend and preserve the integrity of the decade&#x27;s most influential contribution to rock&quot;. Barbara Jaeger of &quot;The Record&quot; called it a &quot;moving, beautifully photographed look at the group&quot; that properly captured the energy of their live performances. She said, &quot;If there is to be a standard against which future rock movies will be judged, &#x27;U2 Rattle and Hum&#x27; is it.&quot; Mackie of &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; said that despite the film offering &quot;few insights into the individual members, the live footage is nothing short of brilliant.&quot; He described Bono&#x27;s speech during &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; as a &quot;raw, emotional moment, a spontaneous outburst that crystalizes the powerful message of peace and love that U2 preach&quot;. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the film &quot;records some savagely compelling live performances&quot; and offers proof of why &quot;this unlikely band... are often ranked by critics as the world&#x27;s best&quot;. He thought that despite Joanou not setting the proper context for the film or conducting an engaging interview with U2, &quot;he matches the impassioned sounds with spectacular visuals&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
Despite the criticism, the &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; album was a strong seller, continuing U2&#x27;s burgeoning commercial success. It hit number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, remaining at the top spot for six weeks; it was the first number-one double album in the US since Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;The River&quot; in 1980. &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; also reached number one in the UK and Australian charts. In the UK, it sold 360,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling album at that point (a record it held until the release of Oasis&#x27;s &quot;Be Here Now&quot; in 1997). Lifetime sales for the album have surpassed 14 million copies.

==Legacy==
In 1989, while at a press tour in Sydney, Australia (where U2 were touring with B. B. King and working on demos for the follow-up album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;), Bono stated, &quot;making movies: that&#x27;s the nonsense of rock &amp; roll&quot;, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine claimed was almost an apology for the film. &quot;Playing shows is the reason we&#x27;re here&quot;, he added. Despite their commercial popularity, the group were dissatisfied creatively; Bono believed they were musically unprepared for their success, while Mullen said, &quot;We were the biggest, but we weren&#x27;t the best.&quot; By the Lovetown Tour, they had become bored with playing their greatest hits. U2 believe that audiences misunderstood the group&#x27;s collaboration with King on &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; and the Lovetown Tour, and they described it as &quot;an excursion down a dead-end street&quot;. Towards the end of the Lovetown Tour, Bono announced on-stage that it was &quot;the end of something for U2&quot;, and that &quot;we have to go away and ... dream it all up again&quot;. The band subsequently reinvented themselves in the 1990s; beginning with &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; in 1991, they incorporated alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and adopted a more ironic, flippant image by which they embraced the &quot;rock star&quot; identity they struggled with in the 1980s.

<text>Lapsang souchong (; ) or Zhengshan xiaozhong (, &#x27;Proper Mountain Small Varietal&#x27;) is a black tea consisting of leaves that are smoke-dried over a pinewood fire. This smoking is accomplished either as a cold smoke of the raw leaves as they are processed or as a hot smoke of previously processed (withered and oxidized) leaves. The intensity of the smoke aroma can be varied by locating the leaves closer or farther (or higher or lower in a multi-level facility) from the source of heat and smoke or by adjusting the duration of the process. The flavour and aroma of smoked lapsang souchong is described as containing notes, including wood smoke, pine resin, smoked paprika, and dried longan; it may be mixed with milk but is not bitter and usually not sweetened with sugar. The tea originates from the Wuyi Mountains region of Fujian and is considered a Wuyi tea (or bohea). It is also produced in Taiwan. It has been labelled as smoked tea (), smoky souchong, tarry lapsang souchong and lapsang souchong crocodile. While the tea leaf grading system adopted the term &quot;souchong&quot; to refer to a particular leaf position, lapsang souchong may be made with any leaf of the plant, though it is not unusual for the lower leaves, which are larger and less flavourful, to be used as the smoking compensates for the lower flavour profile and the higher leaves are more valuable for use in unflavoured or unblended teas. In addition to its consumption as a tea, lapsang souchong is also used in stock for soups, stews and sauces or otherwise as a spice or seasoning. Beginning in the early 21st century, an unsmoked variety of lapsang souchong was developed in the village of Tong Mu Guan in the Wuyi mountains. The unsmoked variety has become increasingly popular, particularly in the Chinese domestic market.

==History==
The lapsang souchong originated in the Wuyi Mountains during the Qing dynasty, although there are earlier examples of smoked teas. Purportedly, lapsang souchong was first created in 1646, as civilians in the Wuyi Mountain areas fled from Qing soldiers who were advancing through the area on their Manchu unification campaign against the Southern Ming. Before they fled, to avoid spoilage of newly plucked leaves, batches were quickly dried over fire and buried in sacks. Afterwards, despite the odour, the tea leaves were shipped and sold to the Dutch traders. At the time, the months-long journey from China to Europe necessitated preservation methods and the partial oxidation of this Wuyi tea, an oolong tea graded as bohea or souchong, was better able to preserve its quality. The smoky souchong tea sold and the Dutch returned to request more. There is an alternative story that soldiers during the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864) interfered with tea processing by using sacks of freshly picked tea leaves as bedding and delaying the drying which had to be hastened by using heat from pinewood-fuelled fire.

The trade name would later become &quot;lapsang souchong&quot; from the Fuzhou dialect: La (pine) Sang (wood) with souchong meaning &quot;small sort&quot; referring to the leaves used. Prior to the British East Indian Company&#x27;s adoption of the terms &quot;black&quot; and &quot;green&quot; to categorize teas, the tea leaves coming from the Wuyi Mountains area were referred to as &quot;bohea&quot;, with &quot;souchong&quot; (小种) referring to a different grade. Before &quot;lapsang&quot; came into use, the term &quot;smoky souchong&quot; was used to describe this tea leaf. Lapsang souchong that is produced in Taiwan is often referred to as &quot;tarry lapsang souchong&quot; or &quot;lapsang souchong crocodile&quot;. The word &quot;souchong&quot; would later be integrated into the tea leaf grading system to refer to the fourth and fifth leaves which are the larger, broader leaves.

==Cultivation and processing==
Lapsang souchong is typically made with the larger, coarser leaves of the Bohea cultivar of the plant. The Bohea cultivar has been bred to more readily absorb the smoke flavouring. The coarseness of the lower leaves also allows the smoke to more readily adhere to the leaf. The addition of the smoke flavour makes the lower concentration of aromatic compounds in these larger leaves, relative to the younger leaves and the bud, less relevant to the taste of the final product. However, any leaf may be used in the production of lapsang souchong, and, indeed, the young leaves and bud are used in Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong. is used for smoking, though other woods, such as cedar and cypress, are sometimes used as well.

Smoked lapsang souchong is manufactured similar to black tea but with an intermediary step of smoking or the addition of an artificial smoke flavour. There are several ways this smoking may be accomplished. The traditional means, referred to as &quot;Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong&quot;, is to entirely process the leaves within the smoke house, equivalent to a cold smoke, though most of the smoke flavouring is instilled during the final drying phase. The indoor withering is done with the leaves laid out on bamboo mats and turned at intervals, followed by a period of rolling to break cell walls and initiate oxidation. The leaves are transferred to cloth bags where they are allowed to oxidize for 5 to 6 hours with a quick pan-firing to the seal the cell walls and halt the oxidation. A second rolling (twisting) then occurs followed by 8 to 12 hours of drying in the presence of smoke.

Generic lapsang souchong uses a similar process but with leaves collected from more distant farms. These leaves are partially processed (e.g. partially withered or oxidized) after plucking and then transported to a centralized smoking facility where they are hot smoked. Smoking may also provide a means to create a marketable product from older or less flavourful leaves. Customization can be accommodated by varying the duration of the smoking or placement of a batch relative to the source of heat and smoke, in addition to the leaf selection. The smoke shed has several upper floors or lofts made of wooden slats where leaves can be laid out, allowing batches to be closer or farther from the source heat and smoke. In addition to Fujian, tea smoking facilities are also located in Taiwan where the lapsang souchong is known for being more heavily smoked.

==Preparation, flavour and aroma==
Like other black teas, lapsang souchong is typically brewed with water at boiling or a little less than boiling, . It can be infused once, for 3 to 5 minutes, with 2 to 3 grams (one tablespoon) of loose-leaf tea per 150 millilitres ( cup) of water used, or through multiple infusions using 5 grams for 30 seconds to one minute at a time in 110 millilitres of water.

The aroma of the dry leaves is described as having intense empyreumatic notes reminiscent of bacon while the liquor is known for its lingering smoky flavour. Other flavours associated with lapsang souchong include wood smoke, pine resin, smoked paprika, dried longan, and peated whisky. Lapsang souchong lacks the bitterness that can come with other black teas, so it does not need to be sweetened and can be brewed strongly. It is a full-bodied tea that can be prepared with or without milk.

The aroma of lapsang souchong is derived from a variety of chemical compounds. The two most abundant constituents of the aroma are longifolene and α-terpineol. Many of the compounds making up the aroma of lapsang souchong, including longifolene, originate only in the pine smoke and are not found in other kinds of tea.

==Tea blends and culinary uses==
Lapsang souchong is used in blends of black tea to provide a more full bodied flavour and a more robust aroma, for example it may be blended with an Earl Grey tea. The blend called Russian Caravan consists of approximately 60% Keemun, 20% lapsang souchong and the remainder being a roasted oolong; the blend is intended to invoke thoughts of camel caravans en route from China to Russia in the 19th century delivering goods such as black tea which could absorb some of the campfire smoke during their months-long journey. In British culture, lapsang souchong has been popularly associated with Winston Churchill who enjoyed the tea but it is used more in Russian-labelled blends, especially those sweetened with spices and citrus.

With its wood-smoked flavour, lapsang souchong is also used as a spice for flavouring or seasoning foods. As well as being added to stock for soups, stews and sauces, lapsang souchong is also a spice in vegetarian recipes, a component in meat rubs, and a flavouring for boiled eggs. When prepared as a tea (rather than used as a seasoning), lapsang souchong pairs well with meals of tuna, cod, game, eggs, or with brunch.

<doc id="276779" wikidata="Q5406949" url="?curid=276779" title="Second audio program">
<text>Second audio program (SAP), also known as secondary audio programming, is an auxiliary audio channel for analog television that can be broadcast or transmitted both over-the-air and by cable television. Used mostly for audio description or other languages, SAP is part of the multichannel television sound (MTS) standard originally set by the National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) in 1984 in the United States. The NTSC video format and MTS are also used in Canada and Mexico.

==Usage==
SAP is often used to provide audio tracks in languages other than the native language included in the program. In the United States, this is sometimes used for Spanish-language audio (especially during sports telecasts), often leading to the function being referred to facetiously as the &quot;Spanish audio program&quot;. Likewise, some Spanish-language programs may, in rare cases, offer English on SAP. Some stations may relay NOAA Weather Radio services, or, particularly in the case of PBS stations, a local National Public Radio (NPR) sister station, on the audio channel when SAP is not being used. In Canada, parliamentary and public affairs channel CPAC similarly uses SAP to carry both English and French-language audio.

SAP is also a means of distribution for audio description of programs for the visually impaired. Under the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, top U.S. television networks and cable networks have been gradually required to broadcast quotas of audio described programming per-quarter, Since May 26, 2015, broadcasters have been required under the Act to provide dictations on SAP of any &quot;emergency information&quot; displayed in a textual format outside of the Emergency Alert System and newscasts.

==Frequencies==
MTS features, including stereo and SAP, travel on subcarriers of the &quot;video&quot; carrier, much like color for television. It is &quot;not&quot; carried on the audio carrier in the manner of stereo sound for an FM radio broadcast, however, as it only has a frequency deviation of ±25 kHz, whereas regular FM broadcasting has a deviation of ±75 kHz. The SAP subcarrier is located at 78.670 kHz, which is five times the 15.734 kHz corresponding to the MTS pilot signal. In turn, the MTS pilot is locked to the horizontal sync frequency of the video carrier for stability. The SAP channel contains mono audio which has been dbx-encoded for noise reduction, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The SAP audio has a bandpass from 60 Hz to 12 kHz, which is less than the &quot;regular&quot; audio channel which runs from 50 Hz to 15 kHz.

Though not technically an SAP channel, television stations can also broadcast a &quot;PRO&quot; (professional) audio subcarrier which is used to communicate with station personnel, particularly those engaged in electronic news gathering. This one-way audio channel allows individuals at the television station to send messages to people located away from the station, and is frequently employed during on-location newscasts as the foldback channel to reporters and cameramen. This channel is located at 6.5 times the pilot (102.271 kHz), and is also part of the MTS standard.

==Other media==
Second audio programs are also available in other media. On analog television receive-only satellite television systems, audio programs are manually tuned by their subcarrier frequency, commonly around 6 MHz, often as low as 5.8 or as high as 7.2. These travel the same way as the discrete left and right main audio channels, and ATIS station ID, which is heard as Morse code. On FM radio, radio reading services and other audio programs can be heard on subcarriers through subsidiary communications authority; however, these are generally prohibited from public listening without special equipment. HD Radio subchannels, somewhat more widely available, operate on a similar premise but generally carry totally unrelated programming to the main feed.

On digital television systems, selection is done through a menu as with analog television, though some provide easier access rather than having to dig down to find the option. Stations may also choose to transmit audio-only programs by assigning them to separate digital subchannels with an optional screen of title and artist information; however, this prevents the viewer from watching the main video in the case of television stations.

<doc id="276783" wikidata="Q213039" url="?curid=276783" title="Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)">
<text>Let Go is the debut album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, released on 4 June 2002, by Arista Records. Critics have described &quot;Let Go&quot; as a pop-punk/alternative rock album with a grunge-oriented sound. The album is considered to have transformed the pop-punk music scene, integrating the genre to the mainstream and contributing to the rise of female-fronted pop-punk music acts. The album has sold over 16 million copies worldwide, making it Lavigne&#x27;s highest-selling album to date and the best selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll named &quot;Let Go&quot; the fourth best album of the 2000s. The album and its singles earned Lavigne eight Grammy Award nominations including Best New Artist, twice for Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album.

The album was credited as the biggest pop debut of 2002. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the album was the 21st-best-selling album of the decade. It was certified 7× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States, and it received a diamond certification from Music Canada. The album reached multi-platinum in many countries around the world, including the UK, in which she became the youngest female solo artist to have a number-one album in the region.

On 18 March 2013, &quot;Let Go&quot; was re-released as a double disc-set paired with her second studio album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, which is released under RCA Records. The album was further promoted by the Try to Shut Me Up Tour between December 2002 and June 2003.

==Background==
In November 2000, Ken Krongard, an A&amp;R representative, invited Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid, then head of Arista Records, to producer Peter Zizzo&#x27;s Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition &quot;so impressed&quot; Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance. By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school&#x27;s skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed skateboarding, school left her feeling insecure. Armed with a record deal, she dropped out to focus on her music career, but she still had to inform her parents of her decision. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going to turn [the record deal] down. It&#x27;s been my dream all my life. They knew how much I wanted this and how much I&#x27;ve put into it.&quot;

Lavigne relocated to Los Angeles, where she collaborated with songwriter and producer Clif Magness, who gave her ample creative control in the writing process. Lavigne and Magness wrote &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot;, songs that she deemed reflective of her vision for the entire album. However, Arista was not thrilled with the heavy-guitar laden songs that Lavigne was writing, prompting the label to look for other producers to match their demands.

Now two years since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the attention of the three-piece production team the Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team&#x27;s manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you put her together with the Matrix for a couple of days?&quot; According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne&#x27;s early songs and felt they contained &quot;a Faith Hill kind of vibe&quot;. As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, the Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, &quot;we cottoned on that she wasn&#x27;t happy but couldn&#x27;t quite figure out where to go.&quot; The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because these were the kinds of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. Lavigne played the Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds evocative of the rock band System of a Down. Fortunately, prior to forming the Matrix, its members&#x27; early projects were in the pop-rock vein, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day. In the meantime, they wrote a song that evolved into &quot;Complicated&quot; and another song called &quot;Falling Down&quot; (which appears on the &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; soundtrack). They played these for Lavigne when she returned the following day; the songs ultimately allowed her to visualize the path she should take.

When Josh Sarubin, the A&amp;R executive who signed Lavigne to the imprint, heard &quot;Complicated&quot;, he knew it was right for her. Lavigne presented the song to Reid, who approved of the musical direction Lavigne and the Matrix were taking, and set &quot;Complicated&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single. Reid sent Lavigne back to the Matrix to work with them, initially for a month. Arista gave the team &quot;&quot; to write and produce ten songs, which took them two months. The album was originally titled &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot;, after the track of the same name that the Matrix produced, but Lavigne asked Reid for the album to be called &quot;Let Go&quot; instead. 

The album cover was taken in Manhattan, New York City at the intersection of Broadway and Canal Street. In 2022, Lavigne visited the same place and recreated the cover in a short video for the 20th anniversary of the album.

==Writing and recording==
With the Matrix, Lavigne recorded tracks in Decoy Studios, situated in a Los Angeles suburb known as Valley Village. She also worked with producer-songwriter Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo, whose Manhattan studio Lavigne was checked in prior to securing a record deal with Arista, and where Lavigne also recorded some of the tracks. The Matrix member Scott Spock was their principal engineer for the project, while Tom Lord-Alge was assigned to mix the tracks. Lavigne recorded complete takes &quot;against the largely finished instrumental tracks&quot;. Spocks revealed Lavigne normally recorded each song in five or six takes, &quot;and probably 90 percent of what was finally used came from the first or second takes.&quot; The Matrix also contributed backing vocals.

Introduced as a singer-songwriter, Lavigne&#x27;s involvement produced significant issues. Lavigne has implied that she is the primary author of the album. In an article published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Lavigne stated that while working with the Matrix, one member would be in the recording studio while they were writing, but did not write the guitar parts, lyrics, or the melody. According to Lavigne, she and Christy wrote all the lyrics together. Graham would come up with some guitar parts, &quot;and I&#x27;d be like, &#x27;Yeah, I like that,&#x27; or &#x27;No, I don&#x27;t like that.&#x27; None of those songs aren&#x27;t from me.&quot;

The Matrix, who produced six songs for Lavigne, five of which appear in the album, had another explanation of how the collaboration went. According to them, they wrote much of the portions in the three singles: &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;, which were conceived using a guitar and piano. Christy said, &quot;Avril would come in and sing a few melodies, change a word here or there.&quot; Reid complemented the issue over the credits: &quot;If I&#x27;m looking for a single for an artist, I don&#x27;t care who writes it. Avril had the freedom to do as she really pleased, and the songs show her point of view. ... Avril has always been confident about her ideas.&quot;

Although she needed pop songs &quot;to break&quot; into the industry, Lavigne felt &quot;Complicated&quot; does not reflect her and her songwriting skills. Nonetheless, she was grateful for the song because it successfully launched her career. She favours more &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, because &quot;it means so much more when it comes straight from the artist&quot;.

==Release and promotion==

The album was released on 4 June 2002, in Canada and the United States. Later, on 22 July, &quot;Let Go&quot; hit record stores worldwide, and on 26 August in some parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. A DataPlay version of the album was released in September 2002. Arista had established a deal with DataPlay earlier in 2002 and included &quot;Let Go&quot; alongside albums by rock singer Santana and singer Whitney Houston in the release.

Although Lavigne was targeted to the teen audience, a marketing strategy credited with the successful launch of her career; Lavigne performed on a host of radio-sponsored multi-artist holiday shows throughout the United States, a marketing strategy that induced higher sales of the album during the season. She embarked on her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, which took place on 23 January 2003, and ended on 4 June 2003. Lavigne toured with her band—drummer Matthew Brann, bassist Mark Spicoluk, and guitarists Jesse Colburn and Evan Taubenfeld—which she had grouped after signing the deal. In the tour, she included all songs off &quot;Let Go&quot;, and cover versions of &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; by Bob Dylan and &quot;Basket Case&quot; by Green Day.

Lavigne filmed her performance in Buffalo, New York, on 18 May 2003, the final date of her five-week headlining North American tour. The tour DVD &quot;My World&quot; was released on 4 November 2003, on joint venture by Arista Records and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The DVD features the concert, a behind-the-scenes featurette, five music videos and a six-song bonus audio CD that includes an unreleased track &quot;Why&quot;.

===Singles===
&quot;Complicated&quot; was released by Arista as the album&#x27;s lead single, which was seen as an across-all-age-groups introduction to Lavigne. Thought to produce wide cross-demographic appeal, however, the music video for the single features Lavigne and her band wreaking havoc in a mall, &quot;the sort of imagery that might have grown-ups thinking &#x27;Clean that mess up!&#x27; more than clamoring for the record.&quot; The song topped the charts in several countries and was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

The second single, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, was aimed at pop-punk-oriented kids. The release of &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; created disagreement among many radio programming directors. However, their impressions were diverted as listeners helped change their minds; early rotation of the single proved successful, showing it was as popular with post-collegiate listeners as with teens. The song reached number one on US mainstream radio.

&quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was released in late November 2002, close to Christmas holidays to remind parents about the album to, if not to buy it themselves, to purchase it for any children in their family. The song became another success for Lavigne reaching number four in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number one on mainstream radio and the top 10 in the UK and Canada. It was not officially released in Australia but received radio and television airplay. To date, &quot;Let Go&quot; is Lavigne&#x27;s only album to produce multiple top-ten singles in the US. The song was also nominated for two Grammy Awards the same categories as &quot;Complicated&quot;. The release arrangement of the album&#x27;s singles, with &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; being served as the third, was regarded as &quot;controversial&quot;, given that &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was &quot;thought by some to be the biggest potential smash on the album&quot;, and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first. According to Reid, &quot;Some people just really didn&#x27;t get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it&#x27;s so young and so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers.&quot;

&quot;Losing Grip&quot; was released as the fourth single from the album, &quot;to act as a bridge into her next album&quot;, which Lavigne stated would be &quot;harder-rocking&quot; than her debut. In 2004, it was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

&quot;Mobile&quot; was released in New Zealand in May 2003, as the fifth single. It was later used in 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Medallion&quot;, the 2004 film &quot;Wimbledon&quot;, and a brief appearance in the film &quot;Just Married&quot;. In 2011, a music video for the song leaked onto the Internet made from official footage that was never finished.

&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; was allegedly released as the sixth and final single when it was sent to the radio in January 2005, almost two years after the previous single from &quot;Let Go&quot;, and after the release of Lavigne&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, though it&#x27;s possible that Radio &amp; Records made a mistake and were actually referring to Nobody&#x27;s Home (Avril Lavigne song).

===20th anniversary edition===
A new edition of &quot;Let Go&quot;, newly remixed by John Feldmann, was released on 3 June 2022, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the original album&#x27;s release.

A new recording of &quot;Breakaway&quot; is featured on the re-release. Lavigne originally wrote the song in 2001, then passed it to American singer Kelly Clarkson who recorded it for &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; soundtrack. The original demo version by Lavigne had previously leaked online in 2014.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Let Go&quot; received mostly positive responses from critics, earning a metascore of 68 over 100 on Metacritic, which is based on the collated reviews from 9 publications. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s music critic Pat Blashill wrote that the album &quot;comes fully loaded with another dozen infectious hymns of &quot;Total Request&quot; angst&quot;. Blashill complimented Lavigne on having a &quot;great voice&quot;, adding she crafted the album with &quot;a qualified staff of hitmakers&quot;. Christina Saraceno of AllMusic noted that Lavigne &quot;handles a variety of styles deftly&quot;, while also complimenting her as &quot;a capable songwriter with vocal chops&quot;. Nonetheless, Saraceno opined that &quot;at her age, one imagines, she is still finding her feet, borrowing from the music she&#x27;s grown up listening to&quot;. John Perry of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine summarized &quot;Let Go&quot; into an &quot;outstanding guitar-pop debut&quot;. A review in &quot;Q&quot; magazine praised Lavigne for displaying &quot;a musical guile way beyond her years&quot;. Kaj Roth of &quot;Melodic&quot; felt that Lavigne &quot;sings lovely and some of the songs goes in the Alanis Morissette vein&quot;. For Jon Caramanica of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine (who gave the album a B−), &quot;Lavigne&#x27;s monochromatic debut set of unimaginative guitar rock is saved only by the earnestness of her songs.&quot;

Some reviewers had similar sentiments toward the quality of the lyrics to some songs in the album. Saraceno said that Lavigne &quot;still has some growing up to do lyrically&quot;, asserting &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; shows her &quot;lyrical shortcomings&quot; and calling the phrasing in &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot; &quot;awkward and sometimes silly&quot;. Perry noted the lyrics to &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; as &quot;endearingly naive&quot;.

===Accolades===
The album earned Lavigne numerous awards from organizations around the world. The success of the album&#x27;s commercial performance led Lavigne to be named Best New Artist at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards. She won three awards—Favorite Female Artist, Favorite Breakthrough Artist, and the Style Award—the most of any performer at the 2003 MTV Asia Awards. She received five nominations for the album at the 2003 Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; were nominated Song of the Year at the 2003 and 2004 ceremony, respectively, accumulating eight nominations for the album. Lavigne was nominated for six categories at the 2003 Juno Awards—which were presented in Ottawa—winning four including Best Album and Best New Artist.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Let Go&quot; was commercially successful in the United States, gaining praise from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine as one of the biggest pop debut albums of 2002. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2022, &quot;Let Go&quot; is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number eight on the strength of 62,000-unit sales and later peaked at number two. Its high debut was fuelled by the success of &quot;Complicated&quot;, which was in heavy rotation on MTV. Increasing weekly sales allowed the album to stay inside the chart&#x27;s top 10 for 37 weeks. The album sold at least 100,000 copies every week straight until late 2002, easily accumulating over 2-million-unit sales. In a December 2002 report by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine, it was stated that the album had sold 3.9 million copies, becoming the third top-selling album of 2002 in the United States. Year-end figures released by Nielsen SoundScan revealed that &quot;Let Go&quot; had sold over 4.1 million copies in the United States, accumulated in 30 weeks of the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Let Go&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. This earned &quot;Let Go&quot; the distinction of being the highest-shipped debut of 2002 and best-selling album by a female artist. On 30 April 2003, the RIAA certified the album six-times platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units. It remains Lavigne&#x27;s best-selling album to date, with 6.9 million copies sold in the United States and over 16 million worldwide.

Chartwise, the album reached higher peak positions notably during and after the holidays. Following her show-opening performance at the 2002 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, &quot;Let Go&quot; continued to be one of the holiday&#x27;s top sellers with sales that week of 272,000. It reached its highest sales week on the issue dated 4 January 2003, with 363,000 copies sold. Although it had peaked at number two in September 2002, &quot;Let Go&quot; rose from three to two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on the issue dated 1 February 2003. The increase of sales was the offshoot to Lavigne&#x27;s appearance on 11 January in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as the show&#x27;s musical guest. There were accusations of lip-synching but in an interview at the time she tells she has never lip-sung or ever plans to. During this time also, Lavigne received much media coverage due to her nominations at the 2003 Grammy Awards and for embarking on her first North American tour. In the United Kingdom, the album took longer to reach the summit of the UK Albums Chart. In its 18th week of release, reached on the chart year 2003, the album hit number one, rising to the top spot over the holiday, making Lavigne breaking a record becoming the youngest female singer to top the chart at 17 years and nine months old. However, the record was broken by Joss Stone in October 2004, when her album &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart when she was 17 years and five months old.

The album&#x27;s international sales upsurge was attributed to the continuing success of &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;. &quot;Let Go&quot; is the 12th best-selling album of 2003 in the United Kingdom. The album has been certified six-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry.

&quot;Let Go&quot; was also selling well in Canada, surpassing sales of over one-million-unit sales in less than a year. The Canadian Recording Industry Association certified the album diamond in May 2003. In Australia, &quot;Let Go&quot; had been certified seven-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association in 2003, based on the sales of over 490,000 units from wholesalers to retailers. 

==Musical style==
&quot;Let Go&quot; was heralded as a pop-punk gem; it is considered to have transformed the pop-punk music scene, integrating the genre to the mainstream and contributing to the rise of female-fronted pop-punk music acts. &quot;Let Go&quot; has also been described as pop, grunge, alternative rock and mainstream rock.

The album contains a variety of musical influences. Pitchfork observed in 2018 that &quot;Let Go&quot; &quot;boasts a handful of genre-changing smashes and mood swings that’d put a high school sophomore to shame.&quot; The diversity came partly from Lavigne&#x27;s wide-ranging interests, and partly because her label and producers were pushing her in different directions. The five songs she wrote with Magness in 2001, including &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot;, had a hard-rocking alternative sound which worried her label. Lavigne told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003 that &quot;Arista was drop-dead shit afraid that I would come out with a whole album&quot; sounding like these songs; they wanted her to go in a more radio-friendly direction. For this purpose, Arista assigned her the production team the Matrix, who wrote the pop rock song &quot;Complicated&quot; with minor help from Lavigne. Half the album was co-written with the Matrix, and the other half with Magness.

==Impact and legacy==
&quot;Let Go&quot; was twentieth on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Greatest of All Time Albums by Women. The album is considered one of the albums that transformed the pop-punk music scene, helping to consolidate the genre in the mainstream and contributing to the rise of female-fronted pop-punk bands and female-driven punk-influenced pop music.

<text>Sung Wong Toi is an important historic relic in Ma Tau Chung, Kowloon, Hong Kong. While its remaining portion is now located in the Sung Wong Toi Garden () at the junction of Ma Tau Chung Road and Sung Wong Toi Road, it was originally a 45-metre-tall boulder standing on the top of Sacred Hill () in Ma Tau Chung above Kowloon Bay.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sung Wong Toi&quot; literally means &quot;Song king terrace&quot;, or &quot;Terrace of the kings of the Song dynasty&quot;. The stone is believed to have been a memorial to the last two boy emperors of the Southern Song dynasty, Zhao Shi and Zhao Bing, who temporarily lived in Hong Kong from 1277 to 1279.
In historical maps and documents, Sung Wong Toi is also known as Hill of the King of the Sung and Song Wong Toi in some occasions.

==History==

===Song dynasty===


According to historical records, when the child emperors Zhao Shi and Zhao Bing of the Song dynasty were fleeing south when the Song Empire was gradually being conquered by the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century, they took refuge at the Sacred Hill along the seashore. Zhao Shi died of illness in Hong Kong, while Zhao Bing died when the Song loyalist Lu Xiufu put him on his shoulders and jumped off a cliff following the defeat of Song by the Yuan at the naval Battle of Yamen.

===Yuan dynasty===
After the Song dynasty was overthrown by the Yuan dynasty in 1279, local residents inscribed the words &quot;Sung Wong Toi&quot; on this large rock that was on the Sacred Hill at that time.

Note that the Chinese character for &quot;&quot;king&quot; () is carved in the stone instead of the conventional &quot;emperor&quot;&quot; (). Both characters are pronounced as &quot;Wong&quot; in Cantonese. This may have been done by the locals to avoid angering the Yuan emperors. The colonial government in 1959 recognized the nature of this intentional word choice, preferred using the character for &quot;emperor&quot; () to name the surrounding locations associated with Sung Wong Toi, namely the park built for settling the trimmed monolith, the nearby road and the metro station.

===Qing dynasty===
In 1807, seven smaller characters were added on the right side of the stone to record the renovation work during the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor.

===Japanese occupation===
During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in 1941–1945, the boulder was dislodged from its place when the Sacred Hill was levelled for an extension of the Kai Tak Airport. A portion of the rock inscribed with Chinese characters survived the blasting operation. That part of the boulder, about one-third of its original size, displays the Chinese name of the stone, &quot;Sung Wong Toi&quot;.

===Post-World War II===

After World War II, this portion of the stone was shaped into a rectangular block and moved to the Sung Wong Toi Garden, a small park especially constructed for it. This park is located in the present-day Kowloon City District, at the junction of Sung Wong Toi Road and Ma Tau Chung Road, which is close to the stone&#x27;s original site. The construction work of the park was completed in the winter of 1945.

The park was planned be relocated to nearby Kai Tak Development as Sung Wong Toi Park.

<doc id="276804" wikidata="Q16341464" url="?curid=276804" title="Panathenaea">
<text>The Panathenaea (or Panathenaia) was a multi-day ancient Greek festival held annually in Athens that would always conclude on 28 Hekatombaion, the first month of the Attic calendar. The main purpose of the festival was for Athenians and non-Athenians to celebrate the goddess Athena. Every four years, the festival was celebrated in a larger manner over a longer time period with increased festivities and was known as the Great(or Greater) Panathenaea. In the years that the festival occurred that were not considered the Great Panathenaea, the festival was known as the Lesser Panathenaea. The festival consisted of various competitions and ceremonies, culminating with a religious procession that ended in the Acropolis of Athens.

== History ==
The inaugural celebration of the Great Panathenaea occurred in 566 BCE and possibly continued until around 410 CE. Edicts issued by Theodosius I in 391 CE banned sacrifices and closed the temples in Athens, making it very unlikely the festival continued until 410 CE despite some archeological evidence that indicates it may have. There is some uncertainty surrounding the creation of the festival but Peisistratos is commonly credited with the solidification of the festival in 566 BCE, organizing it and turning it into a significant Athenian celebration.

=== Mythology ===
There are multiple mentions of the founding of the Panathenaea in Greek mythology that most notably include the stories of Theseus and Erectheus (also referred to as Erichthonius in mythological texts). The &quot;Iliad&quot; holds the earliest mention of the festival and attributes its creation to Erechtheus. The son of Gaia and Hephaestus, Erechtheus created the festival and dedicated it to Athena after becoming the king of Athens. In Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Theseus&quot;, Theseus unifies multiple Attic communities into one state, giving it the name of Athens and creating a feast known as Panathenaea or &quot;the sacrifice of all the united Athenians&quot;.

== Religious festival ==

=== Banquets ===
Athenians would begin the festival with a banquet during the first night in the Agora where meat would be cut up to be distributed using a ceremonial kopis. There was also a major banquet on the second day and a smaller banquet-style meal after the procession on the last day of the festival where people would eat bread alongside parts of the animals that were sacrificed to Athena.

=== Procession ===
The most significant aspect of the festival was the procession to the Acropolis on the last day of the festival (28 Hekatombaion), where Athenians would make sacrifices to the goddess Athena. Such as a Hekatomb (sacrifice of 100 oxen or cows) The night before this procession, the younger population of Athens would have a vigil known as a pannychis where the people would dance on the Acropolis. During this vigil, the people of Athens would sing a paean for Athena, a song of praise that typically would not be sung at celebrations for Athena but at celebrations for the god Apollo instead.

During the Lesser Panathenaea young girls known as arrephoroi would carry a specially woven peplos robe to place on the wooden cult image of Athena located in the Erechtheum, a temple on the north side of the Acropolis that was dedicated to Athena. In line with the occurrence of the Great Panthenaea every four years a larger peplos tapestry would be woven to be put on the statue of Athena in the Parthenon, a temple in the centre of the Acropolis.

Athenians would begin their procession in the Kerameikos neighbourhood and would continue south until they reached the Acropolis. The procession consisted of over 1,000 people from a wide range of backgrounds but was led by the high priestess and the treasurers of the temple followed by the arrephoros carrying the peplos robe. This lead group would be followed by other priests (hieropoios), priestesses (athlothetai), and unmarried young women (kanephoros), magistrates, soldiers, athletes, representatives from other states, musicians, and herdsmen among others. The procession would conclude with more than one hundred cows and sheep being sacrificed on the altar of Athena in the Acropolis in a religious ceremony known as a hecatomb. Non-Athenians also participated in the procession, with female metics carrying hydria I and male metics carrying bread used for the meal after the festival or other non-animal offerings on ornate trays known as skaphai.

== Competitions ==
During the festival many competitions were held including a chariot race, a stadion, and various other athletic events. There would also be singing and poetry competitions, where participants would perform selections from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

=== Prizes ===
After the conclusion of the competitions at the festival, prizes were awarded to the victors. The reward that is most synonymous with the festival was the Panathenaic prize amphora with images on the sides that would remain similar year to year. These prize amphoras were filled with valuable high-class sacred olive oil and the victors would also sometimes receive monetary prizes in the form of Greek drachma instead of amphoras. The victors’ names were carved into stone victor lists, which were displayed in various parts of Athens. They were placed primarily near churches or religious shrines, with the most notable of these places being the Acropolis.
=== Prize amphoras ===
The prize amphoras were the major reward victors received during the festival. People in ancient Greece associated olive oil with Athena because of the mythological story of her gifting the first Moria to Athens, using the tree to claim the city over the god Poseidon. Olive oil and the prize amphoras were associated with power, wealth, and prosperity due to this association with Athena. The standardized versions of these amphoras would typically depict an image of Athena with roosters standing on two columns on each side of the goddess. On the other side of the amphora, there would typically be images related to the event or competition that the amphora was won for. These images were believed to be included in an attempt to show the rest of the world that Athens was the self-proclaimed head of ancient Greek civilization. An armed Athena was meant to indicate that the goddess was the protector of Athens. The roosters supported this image as the people of Athens saw the birds as having a &quot;fighting spirit&quot; with the columns being used to emphasize the rooster&#x27;s presence.
== Archeological influence ==
The Parthenon Frieze is a marble sculpture in the Parthenon in the Acropolis of Athens that has a portion that is interpreted to be depicting people of Athens participating in the religious procession that takes place during the Panathenaea. There are images of the high priestess, priests, a young girl meant to resemble an arrephoros, and people herding animals to be sacrificed to the gods.

== Current relevance ==

The Panathenaea ended around the conclusion of the 4th century CE, but it still holds some relevance in the present day. The Panathenaic Stadium was initially a small racetrack with seating on a hill overlooking the track used for the athletic competitions until it was upgraded in the 4th century BCE by the logographer Lykourgos. He upgraded the track to a small stadium with stone seating, remaining until Herodes Atticus upgraded the stadium again in the middle of the 2nd century CE. He made the stadium much larger and used marble instead of stone. The stadium was abandoned after Theodosius I banned the festival and was not used again until the Zappas Olympics in the late 19th century CE. Before the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics the stadium was completely renovated, going on to host both the opening and closing ceremonies as well as a number of the competitions. The stadium has hosted many athletic events since then, most notably the archery competition and marathon finish for the 2004 Summer Olympics. One side of the Olympic medals from the 2004 Summer Olympics also depicts an image of the Panathenaic Stadium. It is important to note that the modern Olympic Games are more directly inspired by the ancient Olympic Games than the Panathenaic Games.

<doc id="276806" wikidata="Q81611" url="?curid=276806" title="Gulf of Aqaba">
<text>The Gulf of Aqaba () or Gulf of Eilat () is a large gulf at the northern tip of the Red Sea, east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian Peninsula. Its coastline is divided among four countries: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The northernmost coral reef in the world is situated near the Eilat shore.

==Geography==
The gulf is east of the Sinai Peninsula and west of the Arabian Peninsula. With the Gulf of Suez to the west, it extends from the northern portion of the Red Sea. It reaches a maximum depth of in its central area: the Gulf of Suez is significantly wider but less than deep.

The gulf measures at its widest point and stretches some north from the Straits of Tiran to where Israel meets Egypt and Jordan.

Like the coastal waters of the Red Sea, the gulf is one of the world&#x27;s premier sites for diving. The area is especially rich in coral and other marine biodiversity and has both accidental shipwrecks and vessels deliberately sunk in an effort to provide a habitat for marine organisms and bolster the local dive tourism industry.

===Cities===

At this northern end of the gulf are three important cities: Taba in Egypt, Eilat in Israel, and Aqaba in Jordan. They are strategically important commercial ports and popular resorts for tourists seeking to enjoy the warm climate. Further south, Haql is the largest Saudi Arabian city on the gulf. On Sinai, Sharm el-Sheikh and Dahab are the major centres. 

The largest population center is Aqaba, with a population of 148,398 (2015), followed by Eilat with a population of 50,724 (2020).

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the gulf as &quot;A line running from Ràs al Fasma Southwesterly to Requin Island () through Tiran Island to the Southwest point thereof and thence Westward on a parallel (27°54&#x27;N) to the coast of the Sinaï Peninsula&quot;.

==Geology==
The gulf is one of two gulfs created by the Sinai Peninsula&#x27;s bifurcation of the northern Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez lying to the west of the peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba to its east. Geologically, the gulf forms the southern end of the Dead Sea Transform. It contains three small pull-apart basins, the Elat Deep, Aragonese Deep and Dakar Deep, formed between four left lateral strike-slip fault segments. Movement on one of these faults caused the 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake.

==Ecology==

==History==
Trade across the Red Sea between Thebes&#x27; port of Elim and Elat at the head of the gulf is documented as early as the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt. Expeditions crossing the Red Sea and heading south to Punt are mentioned in the fifth, the sixth, the eleventh, the twelfth and the eighteenth dynasties of Egypt, when Hatshepsut built a fleet to support the trade and journeyed south to Punt in a six-month voyage.
Thebes used Nubian gold or Nub from her conquests south into Kush to facilitate the purchase of frankincense, myrrh, bitumen, natron, juniper oil, linen, and copper amulets for the mummification industry at Karnak. Egyptian settlements near Timna at the head of the gulf date to the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt.

At the northern edge, the ancient city of Ayla (in present-day Aqaba) was a commercial hub for the Nabateans. The Romans built the Via Traiana Nova, which joined the King&#x27;s Highway at Aqaba and connected Africa to Asia and the Levant and Red Sea shipping.

Aqaba was a major Ottoman port, connected to Damascus and Medina by the Hejaz railway. During World War I, the Battle of Aqaba was the key battle that ended a 500-year Ottoman rule over the region of Syria.

== Fauna ==
In general, the fauna in the Red Sea represents the fauna in the waters of the Indian Ocean, except that many species cannot penetrate it due to salinity and temperature limitations and some are only found in the southern part of the Red Sea. A large part of the species in the Red Sea are endemic and the proportion of several groups reaches about 30%. It is possible that some of them developed during the Tethys Sea period. The endemic species are more suitable to the conditions in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Eilat and therefore thrive there more than the oceanic species.

==Tourism==

The gulf is one of the most popular diving destinations in the world. About 250,000 dives are performed annually in Eilat&#x27;s 11 km coastline, and diving represents 10% of the tourism income of this area.

The Landscape of Wadi Rum to the east of the northern edge of the gulf is a popular destination. Other destinations are the ruins of the iron-age civilization of Ayla in the city of Aqaba, the site of the World War I Battle of Aqaba, led by Lawrence of Arabia.

Whales, orcas, dolphins, dugongs, and whale sharks live in the gulf as well.

<doc id="276810" wikidata="Q354384" url="?curid=276810" title="Theon of Alexandria">
<text>Theon of Alexandria (; ; ) was a Greek scholar and mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. He edited and arranged Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; and wrote commentaries on works by Euclid and Ptolemy. His daughter Hypatia also won fame as a mathematician.

== Life ==
Little is known about the life of Theon. He made predictions and observations of solar and lunar eclipses in 364 which show he was active at that time, and he is said to have lived during the reign of Theodosius I (379–395).

The &quot;Suda&quot;, a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, calls Theon a &quot;man of the Mouseion&quot;. However, both the Library of Alexandria and the original Mouseion were destroyed in the first century BC and according to classical historian Edward J. Watts, Theon was probably the head of a school called the &quot;Mouseion&quot;, which was named in emulation of the Hellenistic Mouseion that had once included the Library of Alexandria, but which had little other connection to it. Theon&#x27;s school was exclusive, highly prestigious, and doctrinally conservative. Neither Theon nor his daughter Hypatia seems to have had any connections to the militant Iamblichean Neoplatonists who taught in the Serapeum of Alexandria and instead preferred Plotinian neoplatonism.

Theon was the father of the mathematician Hypatia, who succeeded him as head of his school Theon dedicated his commentary on the &quot;Almagest&quot; to a boy named Epiphanius, who may have been his son. Also, in his commentary on the &quot;Almagest&quot; he states that his daughter Hypatia contributed to Book III of the &quot;Almagest&quot; stating &quot;the edition having been prepared by the philosopher, my daughter Hypatia.&quot;

A lunar crater, Theon Junior, now bears Theon&#x27;s name.

== Works ==

=== Edited works ===
It is known that Theon edited the &quot;Elements&quot; of Euclid. He may also have edited some other works by Euclid and Ptolemy, although here the evidence is less certain. The editions ascribed to Theon are:
*&quot;Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot;. Theon&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Elements&quot; was the only known version until François Peyrard discovered an older copy of the &quot;Elements&quot; in the Vatican Library in 1808. Comparison of the two versions show that Theon&#x27;s edition attempts to remove difficulties that might be felt by learners in studying the text. Hence he amplified Euclid&#x27;s text whenever he thought that an argument was too brief; attempted to standardise the way that Euclid wrote; and he corrected mistakes in the text, although occasionally he introduced his own errors. Thomas Little Heath notes on Theon&#x27;s edits include, &quot;remarkably close approximations (stated in sexagesimal fractions)&quot;.
*Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Handy Tables&quot;. A collection of astronomical tables originally compiled by Ptolemy. It has often been claimed in modern times that Theon edited this text. However, none of the surviving manuscripts mention Theon, and the evidence suggests that the surviving tables must be very similar to the tables Ptolemy provided. It has, however, been thought possible that his daughter Hypatia edited (or verified) the &quot;Handy Tables&quot;, since the &quot;Suda&quot; refers to her work on the &quot;Astronomical Canon&quot;.
*Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot;. Euclid&#x27;s work on optics survives in two versions, and it has been argued that one version may be an edition by Theon.

=== Commentaries ===
Of his commentaries, those which are extant are:
*&quot;Commentary on the Data&quot; of Euclid. This work is written at a relatively advanced level as Theon tends to shorten Euclid&#x27;s proofs rather than amplify them. 
*&quot;Commentary on the Optics&quot; of Euclid. This elementary-level work is believed to consist of lecture notes compiled by a student of Theon.
*&quot;Commentary on the Almagest&quot;. Originally a commentary on all thirteen books of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, but now missing book 11 and most of book 5. The commentary is a reworking of Theon&#x27;s own lecture notes, and is useful chiefly for including information from lost works by writers such as Pappus. It is also useful for Theon&#x27;s account of the Greek method of operating with the sexagesimal system as it was applied to calculations. 
*&quot;Great Commentary&quot; on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Handy Tables&quot;. This work partially survives. It originally consisted of 5 books, of which books 1–3 and the beginning of book 4 are extant. It describes how to use Ptolemy&#x27;s tables and gives details on the reasoning behind the calculations.
*&quot;Little Commentary&quot; on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Handy Tables&quot;. This work survives complete. It consists of one book and is intended as a primer for students. In this work Theon mentions that certain (unnamed) ancient astrologers believed that the precession of the equinoxes, rather than being a steady unending motion, instead reverses direction every 640 years, and that the last reversal had been in 158 BC. Theon describes but did not endorse this theory. This idea inspired Thābit ibn Qurra in the 9th century to create the theory of trepidation to explain a variation which he (incorrectly) believed was affecting the rate of precession.
*&quot;Commentary on Aratus&quot;. Some extant &quot;scholia&quot; on the &quot;Phaenomena&quot; of Aratus are attributed doubtfully to Theon.

=== Original works ===
*&quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;. Both the &quot;Suda&quot; and Arabic sources attribute to Theon a work on the astrolabe. This work has not survived, but it may have been the first ever treatise on the astrolabe, and it was important in transmitting Greek knowledge on this instrument to later ages. The extant treatises on the astrolabe by the 6th century Greek scholar John Philoponus and by the 7th century Syriac scholar Severus Sebokht draw heavily on Theon&#x27;s work.
*&quot;Catoptrics&quot;. The authorship of this treatise, ascribed to Euclid, is disputed. It has been argued that Theon wrote or compiled it. The &quot;Catoptrics&quot; concerns the reflection of light and the formation of images by mirrors.
Among Theon&#x27;s lost works, the &quot;Suda&quot; mentions &quot;On Signs and Observation of Birds and the Sound of Crows&quot;; &quot;On the Rising of the Dog[-Star]&quot;; and &quot;On the Inundation of the Nile&quot;.

<text>Frank Anthony Sturgis (December 9, 1924 – December 4, 1993), born Frank Angelo Fiorini, was one of the five Watergate burglars whose capture led to the end of the presidency of Richard Nixon.

He served in several branches of the United States military and in the Cuban Revolution of 1958, worked as an undercover operative for the Central Intelligence Agency, and was alleged to be involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

==Early life and military service==
When still a child, his family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On October 5, 1942, in his senior year of high school, 17-year-old Frank Angelo Fiorini joined the United States Marine Corps and served under Colonel &quot;Red Mike&quot; Merritt A. Edson in the First Marine Raider Battalion in the Pacific Theater during the Second World War.

&quot;On April 14, 1942, William Donovan, as Coordinator of Information (forerunner of the Office of Strategic Services), activated units charged with gathering intelligence, harassing the Japanese through guerrilla actions, identifying targets for the Army Air Force to bomb, and rescuing downed Allied airmen.&quot; This was what led to Stilwell&#x27;s Chinese forces, Wingate&#x27;s Raiders, and Merrill&#x27;s Marauders involvement in the war, and Frank got trained in guerrilla tactics and gathering intelligence, which became useful in his later events.

Honorably discharged as a corporal in 1945, he enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute but left college and joined the Norfolk Police Department on June 5, 1946. He soon discovered a corrupt payoff system and brought it to the attention of his superiors, who told him to overlook the illegal activities. On October 5, 1946, he had a confrontation with his sergeant and resigned the same day. For the next 18 months, he managed the Havana-Madrid tavern in Norfolk that catered to foreigners, mostly Cuban merchant seamen.

On November 9, 1947, Fiorini joined the United States Naval Reserve at the Norfolk Naval Air Station and learned to fly while still working at the tavern. He was honorably discharged on August 30, 1948, and joined the United States Army the next day. He was sent immediately to West Berlin, where the USSR had closed the land routes during the Berlin Blockade, and he became a member of General Lucius Clay&#x27;s honor guard. Two weeks after the USSR reopened the land routes on May 11, 1949, Fiorini was honorably discharged. As a Marine Raider, Fiorini had worked behind enemy lines gathering intelligence, and during his Army tenure in Berlin and Heidelberg, he had a top secret clearance and worked in an intelligence unit whose primary target was the Soviet Union. Fiorini started to believe Russia was a threat, and he became a lifelong militant. Returning to Norfolk in 1952, he took a job managing the Cafe Society tavern, then partnered with its owner, Milton Bass, to co-purchase and manage The Top Hat Nightclub in Virginia Beach.

On September 23, 1952, Frank Fiorini filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk, Virginia, to change his name to Frank Anthony Sturgis, adopting the surname of his stepfather Ralph Sturgis, whom his mother had married in 1937. His new name closely resembled that of Hank Sturgis, the fictional hero of E. Howard Hunt&#x27;s 1949 novel, &quot;Bimini Run&quot;, whose life parallels Frank Sturgis&#x27;s life from 1942 to 1949 in certain salient respects.

==Moves to Cuba, joins Castro forces==
In 1956, Sturgis moved to Cuba, and went to Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama and Honduras. Sturgis moved to Miami in 1957, where the Cuban wife of his uncle Angelo Vona introduced him to former Cuban president Carlos Prío, who joined with other Cubans opposing dictator Fulgencio Batista to plot their return to power. Now Frank had gotten together with an old friend, Richard Sanderlin who was also a Norfolk, Virginia native. Once they had relocated to Miami, Florida, they began an arms and munition smuggling operation into Cuba, bound for the rebels of Fidel Castro. They were sending money to Mexico to support Fidel Castro, whose July 26 Movement had arranged a meeting between CIA Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick and their representatives in 1957 by Pepín Bosch, an executive of the Bacardi Corporation. Prio asked Sturgis to go to Cuba to join up with Castro and to report back to the exiled powers in Miami, so he went down and met with Castro. While Richard Sanderlin traveled to the Sierra Maestra Mountains in Oriente Province Cuba, where he began training the Castro rebels, in military strategy, tactics, weapon handling, and hand to hand fighting.

In 1958, Frank made contact with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Cuba at the US Consulate in Santiago. He worked as an informer for the agency with his control officer Sam Jenis. Sturgis also became involved running guns to Cuba, along with mobster Santo Trafficante, and not surprisingly was arrested for illegal possession of arms, but released without charge. In 1959, Sturgis had contact with casinos in Cuba and some say met Lewis McWillie, mobster Traficante&#x27;s man in Cuba, and the manager of the Tropicana Casino who by his own testimony was a known acquaintance of Jack Ruby.

Sturgis met up with Castro and his 400 rebels in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Sturgis offered to train Castro&#x27;s troops in guerrilla warfare. Castro accepted the offer, but he also had an immediate need for guns and ammunition, so Sturgis became a gunrunner. Using money from anti-Batista Cuban exiles in Miami and some suspect the CIA, Sturgis purchased boatloads of weapons and ammunition from CIA weapons expert Samuel Cummings&#x27; International Armament Corporation in Alexandria, Virginia. Sturgis explained later that he chose to throw in with Castro rather than Prío because Fidel was a soldier, a man of action, whereas Prío was a politician, more a man of words.

In March 1958, Sturgis opened a training camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he taught Che Guevara and other 26th of July Movement rebel soldiers guerrilla warfare. When Castro seized power, a rebel firing squad on San Juan Hill executed 71 of their opponents on January 11, 1959, into an awaiting 40-foot (12.2 m) ditch that had been opened with a bulldozer. Although Sturgis did not take part in the execution, he was photographed afterwards holding a rifle on top of the covered mass grave. His friend Richard Sanderlin, completed the training of Raul Castros Second Front, and led a guerrilla band into combat operations against the Cuban army of Batista.

Castro then appointed Sturgis gambling czar and director of security and intelligence for the air force, in addition to his position as a captain in July 26 Movement. Sturgis went to Miami on June 2, 1959, with Alan McDonald while &quot;supervising the investigation of several American gamblers with criminal records that operate casinos in Havana.&quot; They requested from Metropolitan Criminal Intelligence Supervisor Frank Kappel information on &quot;Meyer and Jake Lansky, Joe Silesi aka Joe Rivers and Santos Trafficante,&quot; that was provided to them six days later after the Cuban government sent an official written request. He was introduced to two men that were transported to Cuba from Venezuela to assist in the organization of the revolution and Frank saw they were clearly communist. He began to sound out those that he knew were anti-communist including Camilo Cienfuegos, as he knew leaders like Raúl Castro and Che Guevara were communist, but he was unsure about Fidel Castro. Sturgis defected the following month with Revolutionary Air Force chief Commandant Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz and they joined the anti-Castro exile opposition.

Sturgis participated with him a few months later in an anti-Castro leaflet-dropping raid over Cuba. Sturgis formed the Anti-Communist Brigade which Hans Tanner in his book &quot;Counter-Revolutionary Agent&quot;, says the organization was &quot;being financed by dispossessed hotel and gambling owners&quot; from Cuba. The Border Patrol in Miami reported that Sturgis was involved in a CIA operation being financed by Sergio Rojas (former Cuban Ambassador to Great Britain) to overthrow Castro. It has been claimed, with little in the way of evidence, that Sturgis was involved in helping the CIA organize the Bay of Pigs Invasion, for whose ultimate failure he blamed President Kennedy. Sturgis recruited 19 year old Marita Lorenz, who was close to Fidel Castro, and she took CIA pills, which she hid in her face cream, to poison Castro, but the plot failed. According to Lorenz, she met Sturgis again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 with others planning a big event. Lorenz stated that she joined Sturgis traveling to Dallas after the meeting. Lorenz later testified about this Kennedy assassination plot before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).

Sturgis was claimed to be a member of Operation 40, a CIA-sponsored counterintelligence group composed of Cuban exiles. The group was formed to seize control of the Cuban government after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The operation was concentrating on Cuba and were operating out of Mexico.

Despite his claimed involvement in numerous CIA sponsored operations including the Bay of Pigs invasion, the 1975 Rockefeller Commission succinctly states that &quot;Frank Sturgis was not an employee or agent of the CIA either in 1963 or at any other time.&quot;

==Watergate burglary 1972==
On June 17, 1972, Sturgis, Virgilio González, Eugenio Martínez, Bernard Barker and James W. McCord, Jr. were arrested while installing electronic listening devices in the national Democratic Party campaign offices located at the Watergate office complex in Washington. The White House office telephone number of CIA officer E. Howard Hunt was found in address books of the burglars. Reporters were able to link the break-in to the White House. The burglars had successfully entered into the same location several weeks earlier, but returned to fix a malfunctioning device and to photograph more documents. Bob Woodward, a reporter working for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was told by a source (Deep Throat) who was employed by the government that senior aides of President Richard Nixon had paid the burglars to obtain information about his political opponents.

Sturgis was portrayed in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, the 1976 film retelling the events of the Watergate scandal, by Ron Hale.

==Prison and later investigations==
In January 1973, Sturgis, Hunt, Gonzalez, Martinez, Barker, G. Gordon Liddy and James W. McCord were convicted of conspiracy, burglary and wiretapping.

Sturgis was convicted in 1973 with Max Gonzalez and Jerry Buchanan in a federal court in Miami (73-597-CR-CA) of transporting cars stolen in Texas into Mexico. This prompted Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Acting Regional Director David W. Costa to send a letter to Judge C. Clyde Atkins on March 10, 1975, indicating that Sturgis had been covertly cooperating with the DEA. Sturgis served 14 months in the minimum security federal prison in Eglin, Florida. After leaving prison, Sturgis served as a Miami police informant and continued providing intelligence on the anti-Castro activities of Dr. Orlando Bosch.

St. George&#x27;s article was published in &quot;True&quot; magazine in August 1974. Sturgis claims that the Watergate burglars had been instructed to find a particular document in the Democratic Party offices. This was a &quot;secret memorandum from the Castro government&quot; that included details of CIA covert actions. Sturgis said &quot;that the Castro government suspected the CIA did not tell the whole truth about these operations even to American political leaders&quot;. In response to Sturgis&#x27; repeated braggadocio to the news media, the CIA issued a public statement on May 30, 1975, indicating that he had never been connected with them &quot;in any way.&quot;

In an interview with New York &quot;Daily News&quot; reporter Paul Meskil on June 20, 1975, Sturgis stated, &quot;I was a spy. I was involved in assassination plots and conspiracies to overthrow several foreign governments including Cuba, Panama, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. I smuggled arms and men into Cuba for Castro and against Castro. I broke into intelligence files. I stole and photographed secret documents. That&#x27;s what spies do.&quot;

Sturgis was denied a pardon by President Jimmy Carter.

==JFK conspiracy allegations==
Sturgis has been the subject of various allegations regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He also made claims that other individuals were involved in the assassination of Kennedy.

===Early allegations: Sturgis as one of the &quot;three tramps&quot;===
&quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;, and the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; photographed three transients under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination of Kennedy. The men later became known as the &quot;three tramps&quot;. According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that these men were involved in a conspiracy originated from theorist Richard E. Sprague who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to Jim Garrison during his investigation of Clay Shaw. Appearing before a nationwide audience on the December 31, 1968, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination. Later, in 1974, assassination researchers Alan J. Weberman and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were Watergate burglars Hunt and Sturgis. Comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis in 1975 after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield. Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage and his charges were reported in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

The Rockefeller Commission reported in 1975 that they investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the CIA, participated in the assassination of Kennedy. The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the &quot;derelicts&quot; bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis &quot;were not shown to have any qualification in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman&quot;. Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, &quot;a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis&quot; with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men were Hunt or Sturgis. In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the &quot;tramps&quot; with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Chrisman. According to the committee, only Chrisman resembled any of the tramps but determined that he was not to be in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination. In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963, arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney. According to the arrest reports, the three men were &quot;taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot&quot;, detained as &quot;investigative prisoners&quot;, described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.

===Sturgis makes his own allegations===
In 1976, Sturgis claimed that he was assigned to investigate any possible role that Cuban exiles may have played in the assassination of Kennedy. He stated that his investigation revealed that ten weeks prior to the assassination, Jack Ruby met with Fidel Castro in Havana, Cuba to discuss &quot;the removal of the President&quot; in order to neutralize the threat of invasion by the United States. According to Sturgis, others at the meeting included Raúl Castro, Che Guevara, Ramiro Valdés and &quot;an Argentine woman who is believed to have been a Russian KGB agent&quot;. He said that Ruby had also made several trips to Havana in the months before the assassination in order to arrange deals in which arms would be sold to Cuba and in which illegal drugs from Cuba would be smuggled into the United States. Sturgis also claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the conspiracy, and that other governments either were involved in the conspiracy or knew of the conspiracy. He said that his investigation did not reveal that Cuban exiles were involved in the assassination.

Sturgis declined to specifically identify the sources of his information, but noted he said that they included members of the &quot;anti-Castro Cuban underground.&quot; He further claimed that associates of his involved in intelligence had independently confirmed his report. According to Sturgis, his report was made in early 1964 and that it was given to &quot;certain American intelligence agencies, including the Senate Internal Security Committee.&quot; He said that he did not know if it had been forwarded to the Warren Commission. Similarly, Sturgis said that information about the 1964 reports had been provided to the Rockefeller Commission as well as the Church Committee&#x27;s intelligence subcommittee chaired by Richard Schweiker, but that he did not know if they received the actual reports.

Sturgis stated he was revealing that he made the reports in order to refute &quot;the leftist element in the country&quot; who claimed the CIA was involved in the assassination of Kennedy. Jack Ruby&#x27;s brother, Earl, responded to the allegations as &quot;outlandish,&quot; &quot;ridiculous,&quot; and &quot;absolutely false&quot;.

In a 1977 television interview conducted by Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Sturgis indicated that Alexander Butterfield had notable &quot;associations&quot; with CIA officials, associating himself with the position taken by L. Fletcher Prouty who had made headlines nationwide with his allegation that Butterfield was operating on behalf of the CIA.

===Marita Lorenz: Sturgis with Oswald===
In September 1977, Marita Lorenz told Paul Meskil of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; that she met Oswald in the fall of 1963 at an Operation 40 safe house in the Little Havana section of Miami. According to Lorenz, she met him again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 in the house of Orlando Bosch, with Sturgis, Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz, and two other Cubans present. She said the men studied Dallas street maps and that she suspected that they were planning on raiding an arsenal. Lorenz stated that she joined the men traveling to Dallas in two cars and carrying &quot;rifles and scopes&quot;, but flew back to Miami the day after they arrived. In response to her allegations, Sturgis said he did not recall ever meeting Oswald and reiterated his previous denials of being involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

On October 31, 1977, Sturgis was arrested in Lorenz&#x27;s apartment after Lorenz told police that Sturgis threatened her in an attempt to force her to change her testimony to federal investigators. In an interview with Steve Dunleavy of the &quot;New York Post&quot; shortly after he posted bail, Sturgis said that he believed communist agents had pressured Lorenz into making the accusations against him. Later that week in Manhattan Criminal Court, charges against Sturgis were dropped after the prosecutor told the judge that his office found no evidence of coercion or harassment. Recapping the series of events, Timothy Crouse of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described Sturgis and Lorenz as &quot;two of the most notoriously unreliable sources in America&quot;.

===Posthumous allegations: Hunt&#x27;s &quot;deathbed confession&quot;===
After the death of Hunt in 2007, John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. In the April 5, 2007, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father including Sturgis, as well as Cord Meyer, David Sánchez Morales, David Atlee Phillips, William Harvey and an assassin he termed &quot;French gunman grassy knoll&quot; who many presume was Lucien Sarti. The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, &quot;American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond&quot;, to avoid possible perjury charges. According to Hunt&#x27;s widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt&#x27;s loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be &quot;inconclusive&quot;.

==Portugal, 1980: Camarate Affair==

Sturgis is also linked to the assassination, on December 4, 1980, of Portuguese prime minister Francisco de Sá Carneiro and 6 other people aboard a Cessna aircraft, in what became known as the Camarate affair. He was named by two of his alleged accomplices, Fernando Farinha Simões and José Esteves, in a written confession, as the person who pressed the button of the detonator to activate the bomb on the plane.

==Later life==
In 1979, Sturgis traveled to Angola to help rebels fighting the communist government, which was supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union, and to teach guerrilla warfare. In 1981 he went to Honduras to train the US backed Contras who were fighting Nicaragua&#x27;s Sandinista government, which was supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union; the Army of El Salvador; and the Honduras death squads. He made a second trip to Angola and trained rebels in the Angolan bush for Holden Roberto. He interacted with Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal. In 1989 he visited Yassir Arafat in Tunis. Arafat shared elements of his peace plan, and Sturgis was debriefed by the CIA on his return.

In an obituary published December 5, 1993, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Sturgis&#x27; lawyer, Ellis Rubin, as saying that Sturgis died of cancer a week after he was admitted to a veterans&#x27; hospital in Miami, five days shy of his 69th birthday. It was reported that doctors diagnosed lung cancer that had spread to his kidneys, and that he was survived by a wife, Jan, and a daughter named Autumn.

<text>The semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) is a small plover. &quot;Charadrius&quot; is a Late Latin word for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate. It derives from Ancient Greek &quot;kharadrios&quot; a bird found in ravines and river valleys (&quot;kharadra&quot;, &quot;ravine&quot;). The specific &quot;semipalmatus&quot; is Latin and comes from &quot;semi&quot;, &quot;half&quot; and &quot;palma&quot;, &quot;palm&quot;. Like the English name, this refers to its only partially webbed feet.

==Description==
This species weighs a mean 47.4 g (1.7 oz.) for males and 46.1 g (1.6 oz.) for females, with body masses ranging from 37.6-54.7 g (1.3-1.9 oz.). and measures in length with a mean wing length. Adults have a grey-brown back and wings, a white belly, and a white breast with one black neckband. They have a brown cap, a white forehead, a black mask around the eyes and a short orange and black bill.
==Habitat==
Their breeding habitat is open ground on beaches or flats across northern Canada and Alaska. They nest on the ground in an open area with little or no plant growth.

They are migratory and winter in coastal areas of the southern United States, the Caribbean and much of South America. They are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe, and have been found in Tierra del Fuego and the Isles of Scilly. Their true status may be obscured by the difficulty in identifying them from the very similar ringed plover of Eurasia, of which it was formerly considered a subspecies.

==Behavior==

Semipalmated plovers forage for food on beaches, tidal flats and fields, usually by sight. They eat insects (such as the larvae of long-legged and beach flies, larvae of soldier flies and shore flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers and &quot;Ochtebius&quot; beetles), spiders, crustaceans (such as isopods, decapods and copepods) and worms (such as polychaetes). They also consume small molluscs including bivalves and gastropods, including snails such as coffee bean snails and &quot;Odostomia laevigata&quot;. These opportunistic feeders also feed on berries or seeds from grasslands or cultivated fields. This bird resembles the killdeer but is much smaller and has only one band. Since the semipalmated plover nests on the ground, it uses a &quot;broken-wing&quot; display to lure intruders away from the nest, in a display similar to the related killdeer.

<text>Simon Smith Kuznets ( ; ; April 30, 1901 – July 8, 1985) was a Russian-born American economist and statistician who received the 1971 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences &quot;for his empirically founded interpretation of economic growth which has led to new and deepened insight into the economic and social structure and process of development.&quot;

Kuznets made a decisive contribution to the transformation of economics into an empirical science and to the formation of quantitative economic history. Kuznets pioneered the concept of gross domestic product, which seeks to capture all economic production in a state by a single measure.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Simon Kuznets was born in 1901 in Pinsk, Russian Empire, in modern Belarus, to a Lithuanian-Jewish family. He was one of three brothers, the other being Solomon and George. He completed his schooling, first at the Rivne, then, Kharkiv Realschule of Ukraine. In 1918, Kuznets entered the Kharkiv Institute of Commerce where he studied economic sciences, statistics, history and mathematics under the guidance of professors P. Fomin (political economy), A. Antsiferov (statistics), V. Levitsky (economic history and economic thought), S. Bernstein (probability theory), V. Davats (mathematics), and others. Basic academic courses at the Institute helped him to acquire &quot;exceptional&quot; erudition in economics, as well as in history, demography, statistics and natural sciences. According to the institute&#x27;s curriculum, development of national economies had to be analyzed in the wider context of changes in &quot;connected spheres&quot; and with the involvement of proper methods and empirical data. There, he began to study economics, and became exposed to Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s theory of innovation and the business cycle.

At the turn of the decade, the normal work in the institute was interrupted by the events of the Civil War; reorganizations were undertaken by the Soviet authorities in the sphere of the higher education. There is no precise information whether Kuznets continued his studies at the institute, but it is known that he joined the Department of Labor of UZHBURO (South Bureau) of the Central Council of Trade Unions. There, he published his first scientific paper, &quot;Monetary wages and salaries of factory workers in Kharkov in 1920&quot;; he explored the dynamics of different types of wages by industries in Kharkov and income differentiation, depending on the wage system.

===Emigration to the United States===
In 1922, the Kuznets family emigrated to the United States. Kuznets then studied at Columbia University under the guidance of Wesley Clair Mitchell. He graduated with a B.S. in 1923, M.A. in 1924, and Ph.D. in 1926. As his magister thesis, he defended his essay &quot;Economic system of Dr. Schumpeter, presented and analyzed&quot;, written in Kharkiv. From 1925 to 1926, Kuznets spent time studying economic patterns in prices as the Research Fellow at the Social Science Research Council. It was this work that led to his book &quot;Secular Movements in Production and Prices&quot;, defended as a doctoral thesis and published in 1930.

In 1927, he became a member of the research staff of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), where he worked until 1961. From 1931 until 1936, Kuznets was a part-time professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1937 he was elected as a fellow of the American Statistical Association. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu social science honor society chapter at the University of Pennsylvania and actively served as a chapter officer in the 1940s; becoming a full-time professor from 1936 until 1954. In 1954, Kuznets moved to Johns Hopkins University, where he was professor of political economy until 1960. From 1961 until his retirement in 1970, Kuznets taught at Harvard.

Apart from that, Kuznets collaborated with a number of research organizations and government agencies. From 1931 to 1934, at Mitchell&#x27;s behest, Kuznets took charge of the NBER&#x27;s work on U.S. national income accounts, giving the first official estimation of the US national income. In 1936, Kuznets took the lead in establishing the Conference on Research, Income and Wealth, which brought together government officials and academic economists, engaged in the development of the U.S. national income and product accounts, and in 1947 helped to establish its international counterpart, the International Association for Research in Income and Wealth.

During the Second World War, between 1942 and 1944, Kuznets became the associate director of the Bureau of Planning and Statistics of the War Production Board. He took part in work to assess the country&#x27;s capacity to expand military production. Researchers used national income accounting, together with a rough form of linear programming, to measure the potential for increased production and the resources from which it would come, and to identify the materials that were binding constraints on expansion.

After the war, he worked as an advisor for the governments of China, Japan, India, Korea, Taiwan, and Israel in the establishment of their national systems of economic information. Kuznets cooperated with the Growth Center of Yale University, the Social Science Research Council (SSRC). He guided extensive research, holding a number of positions in research institutions, such as the Chairman of the Falk Project for Economic Research in Israel, 1953–1963; member of the board of trustees and honorary chairman, Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in Israel, from 1963; and chairman, Social Science Research Council Committee on the Economy of China, 1961–1970.

Kuznets was elected as the President of the American Economic Association (1954), President of the American Statistical Association (1949), an honorable member of the Association of Economic History, the Royal Statistical Society of England and a member of the Econometric Society, the International Statistical Institute, the American Philosophical Society, the Royal Swedish Academy and a corresponding member of the British Academy. He was awarded the Medal of Francis Walker (1977).

Simon Kuznets died on July 8, 1985, at the age of 84. In 2013 The Kharkiv National University of Economics, where he studied in 1918–1921 was named after him; Simon Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics.

==Impact on economics==
His name is associated with the formation of modern economic science as an empirical discipline, the development of statistical methods of research and the emergence of quantitative economic history. Kuznets is credited with revolutionising econometrics, and this work is credited with fueling the so-called Keynesian revolution.

Kuznets&#x27; views and scientific methodology were highly influenced by methodological settings received by him in Kharkiv and fully shared by Mitchell for the statistical, inductive construction of hypotheses in economics and its empirical testing. Kuznets treated a priori and speculative conceptions with deep skepticism. At the same time, Kuznets tended to analyze economy in connection with the wider context of historical situation, demographic, and social processes, a method that was peculiar to the Kharkiv academics at the beginning of the 20th century. Kuznets was influenced by the work of such leading theorists as Joseph A. Schumpeter (who probed the relationship between technological change and business cycles), A. C. Pigou (who identified circumstances under which markets failed to maximize economic welfare), and Vilfredo Pareto (who propounded a law governing the distribution of income among households). Kuznets was closely familiar with the economics of Russia and Ukraine of the early 20th century. In the 1920s, he reviewed and translated the papers of Kondratiev, Slutsky, Pervushin, Weinstein. who were then little known in the West.

===Historical series of economic dynamics and Kuznets cycles, or &quot;long swings&quot;===
The first major research project in which Kuznets was involved was the study of long series of economic dynamics in the USA undertaken in the mid-1920s. The collected data covered the period from 1865 to 1925, and for some indices achieved 1770. Applying for the analysis of time series approximating Gompertz and logistic curves, Kuznets found that the characteristics of the curves with reasonable accuracy described the majority of economic processes. Fitting trend curves to data and analysis of the time series, comparison of theoretical and empirical levels, allowed him to identify medium-term extended cycles of economic activity, which lasted 15–25 years and had an intermediate position between the Kondratyev &quot;long waves&quot; and short business cycles. Aspiring to determine the nature of these cycles, Kuznets analyzed the dynamics of population, the construction industry performance, capital, national income data and other variables. These movements became known among economists and economic historians as &quot;Kuznets cycles&quot;, and alternatively as &quot;long swings&quot; in the economy&#x27;s growth rate (following the work of Moses Abramovitz [1912–1999]).

===National income accounts===
In 1931, at Mitchell&#x27;s behest, Kuznets took charge of the NBER&#x27;s work on U.S. national income accounts. In 1934, an assessment of the national income of the United States for the period 1929–1932 was given; further, it was extended to 1919–1938, and then, until 1869. Although Kuznets was not the first economist to try this, his work was so comprehensive and meticulous that it set the standard in the field. (He explicitly notes his work as an update of W. I. King&#x27;s 1930 &quot;The National income and Its Purchasing Power&quot; in https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c4231/c4231.pdf, as well as the contribution of Lillian Epstein, Elizabeth Jenk, and Edna Ehrenberg, the first of which had also contributed to King&#x27;s 1930 book.)

Kuznets had success to solve numerous problems ranging from lack of sources of information and bias assessments, to the development of the theoretical concept of national income. Kuznets achieved a high precision in calculations. His works allowed us to analyze the structure of the national income, and expose to detailed study a number of specific problems of the national economy. Improved methods for calculating the national income and related indicators have become classics and formed the basis of the modern system of national accounts. Having analyzed the distribution of income among different social groups, Kuznets put forward the hypothesis that in countries, which were on the early stages of economic development, income inequality increased first, but as far as national economy was growing, it tended to decrease. This assumption formed the basis of so-called &quot;Kuznets curve&quot; empirical conception.

Kuznets helped the U.S. Department of Commerce to standardize the measurement of GNP. He disapproved, however, of its use as a general indication of welfare, writing that &quot;the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.&quot;

Exploring the formation of the national income, Kuznets studied proportions between output and income, consumption and savings, etc. After analyzing the long-term data sets of economic conditions for 20 countries, Kuznets revealed long-term trends in capital / output ratios, shares of net capital formation, net investment, and so on. Collected and systematized data allowed exposing to empirical testing a number of existing hypotheses. In particular, this concerned premises of the Keynes theory – Keynes&#x27; 1936 absolute income hypothesis.

The hypothesis gave birth to what would become the first formal consumption function. However, Kuznets shook the economic world by finding that Keynes&#x27; predictions, while seemingly accurate in short-run cross-sections, broke down under more rigorous examination. In his 1942 tome &quot;Uses of National Income in Peace and War&quot;, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Kuznets became the first economist to show that the Absolute Income Hypothesis gives inaccurate predictions in the long run (by using time-series data). Keynes had predicted that as aggregate income increases, so will marginal savings. Kuznets used new data to show that, over a longer span of time (1870s – 1940s) the savings ratio remained constant, despite large changes in income. This paved the way for Milton Friedman&#x27;s permanent income hypothesis, and several more modern alternatives such as the life-cycle hypothesis and the relative income hypothesis.

===Economic growth===
By the end of the Second World War Kuznets moved into a new research area, related to the tie between changes in income and growth. He proposed a research program that involved extensive empirical studies on the four key elements of economic growth. The elements were demographic growth, growth of knowledge, in-country adaptation to growth factors, and external economic relations between the countries. The general theory of economic growth should explain the development of advanced industrial countries, and the reasons that prevent the development of backward countries, include both market and planned economies, large and small, developed and developing countries, consider the impact on growth of foreign economic relations.

He collected and analyzed statistical indicators of economic performance of 14 countries in Europe, the U.S. and Japan for 60 years. Analysis of the materials led to the advancement of a number of hypotheses relating to various aspects of the mechanism of economic growth, concerning the level and variability of growth, structure of the GNP and distribution of labor, the distribution of income between households, the structure of foreign trade. Kuznets founded the historically grounded theory of economic growth. The central theme of these empirical studies is that the growth of the aggregated product of the country necessarily implies a profound transformation of the whole of its economic structure. This transformation affects many aspects of economic life – the structure of production, sectoral and occupational structure of employment, the division of occupations among family and market activities, the income structure, size, age structure and spatial distribution of the population, cross-country flows of goods, capital, labor and knowledge, the organization of industry and governmental regulation. Such changes, in his opinion, are essential for overall growth and, once started, shape, constrain or support the subsequent economic development of the country. Kuznets made a profound analysis of the impact on economic growth by demographic processes and characteristics.

His major thesis, which argued that underdeveloped countries of today possess characteristics different from those that industrialized countries faced before they developed, helped put an end to the simplistic view that all countries went through the same &quot;linear stages&quot; in their history and launched the separate field of development economics – which now focused on the analysis of modern underdeveloped countries&#x27; distinct experiences.

==Kuznets curve==
Among his several observations which sparked important theoretical research programs was the Kuznets curve, an inverted U-shaped relation between income inequality and economic growth (1955, 1963). In poor countries, economic growth increased the income disparity between rich and poor people. In wealthier countries, economic growth narrowed the difference. By noting patterns of income inequality in developed and underdeveloped countries, he proposed that as countries experienced economic growth, the income inequality first increases and then decreases. The reasoning was that in order to experience growth, countries had to shift from agricultural to industrial sectors. While there was little variation in the agricultural income, industrialization led to large differences in income. Additionally, as economies experienced growth, mass education provided greater opportunities which decreased the inequality and the lower income portion of the population gained political power to change governmental policies. He also discovered the patterns in savings-income behavior which launched the life-cycle-permanent-income hypothesis of Modigliani and Friedman. He conducted his research for many years and finally published his findings in 1963.

===Historical and economic works of the 1970s===
In his historical and economic studies of the 1970s, Kuznets expressed the idea of an interaction between science and technology (innovations), and institutional shifts, as well as the role of factors external to the economy, such as those caused by the moral and political climate in society, and their impact on the progress and results of economic growth.

<text>Apparent wind is the wind experienced by a moving object.

==Definition of apparent wind==
The &quot;apparent wind&quot; is the wind experienced by an observer in motion and is the relative velocity of the wind in relation to the observer.

The &quot;velocity of the apparent wind&quot; is the vector sum of the &quot;velocity of the headwind&quot; (which is the velocity a moving object would experience in still air) plus the &quot;velocity of the true wind&quot;. The headwind is the additive inverse of the object&#x27;s velocity; therefore, the &quot;velocity of the apparent wind&quot; can also be defined as a vector sum of the &quot;velocity of the true wind&quot; minus the &quot;velocity of the object&quot;.

==Apparent wind in sailing==
In sailing, &quot;apparent wind&quot; is the speed and direction of wind indicated by a wind instrument (anemometer) on a &quot;moving&quot; craft (on water, land or ice) in undisturbed air. It is composed of the &quot;combined&quot; speeds and directions of the craft and wind observed by a &quot;stationary&quot; wind instrument—the &quot;true wind&quot;. A true wind coming from the bow increases the apparent wind induced by the speed of the craft, coming from the stern it decreases apparent wind, and coming from the side the apparent wind angle and speed change according to the combined speed and direction of each the craft and the true wind. Apparent wind is important to sailors in order to set sail angle with respect to the wind and to anticipate how much power the wind will generate on a point of sail. Apparent wind differs in speed and direction from the true wind that is experienced by a stationary observer and composed of the true wind speed (TWS) and true wind direction (TWD) or the TWS and true wind angle (TWA) relative to the boat if it were stationary.
In nautical terminology, apparent wind is measured in knots and degrees.

Note that a number of additional factors come into play when converting the measurements from the masthead anemometer into the true wind if a high degree of accuracy is required, including the following:
* Leeway (or drift on power vessels) - Factors like water currents or slipping sideways due to wind (leeway) mean that the direction a craft is pointing often does not exactly match its actual direction of travel. This must be corrected for when converting apparent wind angle to true wind direction. The same effect is found when the craft is altering course.
* Mast twist - the rigging loads often put a significant amount of torsion on the mast, especially if the rig has runners, so it is twisted along its length
* Mast rotation - many racing multihulls have a mast that can be rotated, so the anemometer reading needs to be corrected by the angle of rotation of the mast
* Heel angle - this is a simple trigonometric correction
* Upwash from the sails - the airflow around the top of the mast is distorted by the presence of the sails. This effect varies with the sails set at the time, the wind speed and the point of sail, but is noticed by the true wind angle changing from port to starboard tack, and the true wind speed changing from when beating to running
* Boat motions - as the masthead is so distant from the centre of motion of the craft, inertial effect on both the wind vane and the anemometer cups can be significant when the craft is moving, especially when pitching and rolling
* Wind shear - there can be a significant change in both wind speed and direction between the water&#x27;s surface and the top of the mast, especially in conditions of unstable, light airs. The wind instruments are just measuring conditions at the masthead, and these are not necessarily the same at all heights

In the presence of a current, the true wind is considered to be that measured on the craft drifting with the water over the bottom, and wind with respect to the sea bed as the &quot;ground&quot; or &quot;geographical wind&quot;.

==Instruments==
The apparent wind on board (a boat) is often quoted as a speed measured by a masthead transducer containing an anemometer and wind vane that measures wind speed in knots and wind direction in degrees relative to the heading of the boat. Modern instrumentation can calculate the true wind velocity when the apparent wind and boat speed and direction are input.

==Implications on sailing speeds==
In sailboat racing, and especially in speed sailing, apparent wind is a vital factor, when determining the points of sail a sailboat can effectively travel in. 
A vessel traveling at increasing speed relative to the &quot;prevailing wind&quot; will encounter the wind driving the sail at a decreasing angle and increasing velocity. Eventually, the increased drag and diminished degree of efficiency of a sail at extremely low angles will cause a loss of accelerating force. This constitutes the main limitation to the speed of wind-driven vessels and vehicles.

Windsurfers and certain types of boats are able to sail faster than the true wind. These include fast multihulls and some planing monohulls. Ice-sailors and land-sailors also usually fall into this category, because of their relatively low amount of drag or friction.

The AC72 foiling catamarans used in the America&#x27;s Cup are an example of this phenomenon, as the boats sail through the water at up to double the environmental wind speed. The effect of this is to radically change the apparent wind direction when sailing &quot;downwind&quot;. In these boats the forward speed is so great that the apparent wind is always forward—at an angle that varies between 2 and 4 degrees to the wing sail. This means that AC72&#x27;s are effectively tacking downwind, although at a greater angle than the normal 45-degree upwind angle, usually between 50 and 70 degrees.

==Other areas of relevance==
In fixed-wing aircraft, apparent wind is what is experienced on board, and it determines the necessary speeds for take-off and landing. Aircraft carriers generally steam directly upwind at maximum speed, in order to increase apparent wind and reduce the necessary take-off velocity. Land-based airport traffic, as well as most mid-sized and large birds generally take off and land facing upwind for the same reason.

==Calculating apparent velocity and angle==

formula_1

Where:
* formula_2 = velocity (boat speed over ground, always ≥ 0)
* formula_3 = true wind velocity (always ≥ 0)
* formula_4 = true pointing angle in degrees (0 = upwind, 180 = downwind)
* formula_5 = apparent wind velocity (always ≥ 0)
The above formula is derived from the Law of cosines and using formula_6.

The angle of apparent wind (formula_7) can be calculated from the measured velocity of the boat and wind using the inverse cosine in degrees (formula_8)

formula_9

If the velocity of the boat and the velocity and the angle of the apparent wind are known, for instance from a measurement, the true wind velocity and direction can be calculated with:

formula_10

and

formula_11

&quot;Note:&quot; Due to quadrant ambiguity, this equation for formula_12 is only valid when the apparent winds are coming from the starboard direction (0° &lt; &quot;β&quot; &lt; 180°). For port apparent winds (180° &lt; &quot;β&quot; &lt; 360° or 0° &gt; &quot;β&quot; &gt; -180°), the true pointing angle (&quot;α&quot;) has the opposite sign:

formula_13

<doc id="276826" wikidata="Q530194" url="?curid=276826" title="Upland sandpiper">
<text>The upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda) is a large sandpiper, closely related to the curlews. Older names are the upland plover and Bartram&#x27;s sandpiper. In Louisiana, it is also colloquially known as the papabotte. It is the only member of the genus &quot;Bartramia&quot;. The genus name and the old common name Bartram&#x27;s sandpiper commemorate the American naturalist William Bartram. The species name &quot; longicauda&quot; is from Latin &quot;longus&quot;, &quot;long&quot; and &quot;caudus&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;. The name &quot;Bartram&#x27;s sandpiper&quot; was made popular by Alexander Wilson, who was taught ornithology and natural history illustration by Bartram.

==Description==

An adult is roughly long with a wingspan. The average weight is . This odd bird has a small dove-like head on a long neck. It is heavily marbled black and brown on the back and wings. The neck is streaked with dark brown which continues down to the breast and on to the flanks. The belly and undertail coverts are white, and the tail is quite long for a sandpiper. The upland sandpiper also has a white eye-ring and long yellow legs.

==Range==
They breed from eastern Alaska south east of the Rocky Mountains through Montana to northern Oklahoma and then northeast to Pennsylvania, New England and extreme southern Quebec and Ontario. There are also local breeding populations in northeast Oregon and west central Idaho. They winter in northeastern Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is an extremely rare vagrant to the South Pacific, with one record each from Australia and New Zealand.

==Habitat==
Even though they are sandpipers, they prefer open country with tall grasses to coastal habitat. They are also found at airports, blueberry farms and abandoned strip mines in the east. Their true core range and habitat is in the northern midwest United States.

==Behavior and diet==
Upland sandpipers forage in fields, picking up food by sight. They are frequently sighted on fence posts and even telephone poles. When an &quot;uppy&quot; alights, it holds its wings up for a few seconds. They are constantly scanning the horizon for intruders. The upland sandpiper&#x27;s diet includes grasshoppers, crickets, weevils, beetles, moths, ants, flies, bugs, centipedes, millipedes, spiders, snails and earthworms. It also eats some grains and seeds.

Every year, between September and October, some upland sandpipers migrate to Ozogoche lagoons, in southern Ecuador. Hundreds of them swoop down and dive into the icy waters of the lagoons, where they die of hypothermia. The explanation for this behavior is uncertain.

===Breeding===

Upland sandpipers can sometimes be found in small, loose nesting colonies. The breeding season is from early-to-late summer; nests are located on the ground in dense grass. The female lays 4 eggs. Both parents look after the young and may perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest or young birds.

===Call===

Upland sandpipers can be identified by a distinctive call, sometimes called a &quot;wolf whistle&quot;, which features a long, ascending whistle followed by a second rising and/or falling call. These sounds are often made while the bird is landing or while flying high.

==Conservation==
The numbers of these birds increased as forests were cleared in the early 19th century, but declined sharply in the late 19th century due to hunting. They are now regularly present in Midwestern North America but populations are scattered in the east.

Loss of prairie habitat is a concern. Also, livestock grazing has been found to reduce the number of nests in a field. Controlled burns may benefit this species as they feed on low-growing plants that are more easily spotted after a fire.

<doc id="276832" wikidata="Q1809877" url="?curid=276832" title="Richelieu River">
<text>The Richelieu River () is a river of Quebec, Canada, and a major right-bank tributary of the St. Lawrence River. It rises at Lake Champlain, from which it flows northward through Quebec and empties into the St. Lawrence. It was formerly known by the French as the Iroquois River and the Chambly River, and was named for Cardinal Richelieu, the powerful minister under Louis XIII.

This river was a long a key route of water transport for trading, first by indigenous peoples, and then for cross-border trade between Canada and the United States. With 19th-century construction of the Champlain Canal (1823) south of Lake Champlain and the Chambly Canal (1843) to the north, the Richelieu provided a direct route from the Saint Lawrence River to New York via Lake Champlain, the canals, and the Hudson River. The construction of rail transport in the mid-19th century competed with such river/canal routes and ultimately succeeded them, because of faster service with greater freight capacity.

Because of the river&#x27;s strategic position between New France and New England, several military fortifications were erected on its course. It served as a key pathway for several military tours and was the scene of several battles between the end of the 17th and early 19th centuries, first between the French and the Iroquois; then between the French and the English, during the regime of New France; and finally between the British and the rebel Americans after 1760.

==Geography and hydrography==

The Richelieu River has a drainage basin of – including those of Lake Champlain and Missisquoi Bay (). Of this, are in the United States, originating in the western slopes of the Green Mountains and the eastern slopes of the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. The Champlain Valley makes up most of the drainage basin.

With a length of , the Richelieu River takes its source at the north end of Lake Champlain, now on the border between Canada (Quebec) and the United States (Vermont and New York state). The river flows through many towns in Quebec: Lacolle, Île aux Noix, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Chambly, Beloeil, Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, Saint-Ours and Sorel-Tracy, where the river empties into the Saint Lawrence River, around northeast of Montreal and southwest of Quebec City.

The Richelieu River is the largest tributary of the south or right shore of the Saint Lawrence River and drains a large area of southern Quebec. The Quebec portion of the watershed (about 15% of its total area) includes 18 lakes and ponds, as well as forty rivers and tributary streams of the Richelieu. The main Richelieu tributaries are rivers: Acadia, South Huron and Lacolle. The river&#x27;s mean discharge is .

Nearly 340,000 people across eight Regional county municipalities (RCM in English or MRC in French) and 65 municipalities, live in the Quebec portion of the watershed of the river. The population density (140 inhabitants per km2) is very high compared to that of most other regions of the province of Quebec. Just over 70% of this area is used for agricultural purposes.

With the opening of the Chambly Canal in 1843, navigation became possible on the Richelieu between the Saint Lawrence River and Lake Champlain. At the southern end of the lake, New York had built the Champlain Canal (opened in 1823), which allows for navigation to the Hudson River and, downstream, the city of New York, a major market and port. There the Hudson flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It is a major international trading port.

Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Chambly, Beloeil, Mont-Saint-Hilaire, and Sorel-Tracy are important communities on its route.

===River course and hydrology===

The average slope of the Richelieu River is , but in elevation between Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Chambly for an average flow of .

By convention, the Richelieu is generally divided into three main sections:

* The Haut-Richelieu (upper Richelieu, between Lake Champlain and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu). It is characterized by a very low drop ( over ). With a width of about at its southern end, it becomes increasingly narrow (width of about in its most narrow areas). It passes through the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, which now includes Iberville and Saint-Luc (merged in 2001).
* The Chambly Canal (of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu to Chambly). Due to its significant drop in this area – over – the river has many rapids. The channel consists of nine locks and a length of nearly , allowing boats to navigate past the rapids. In Chambly, the river widens and forms the Chambly Basin, a popular area for nautical activities.
* The Bas-Richelieu (lower Richelieu, between Chambly and the Saint Lawrence River). In this section, the river passes the cities of Otterburn Park, Beloeil, Mont-Saint-Hilaire and municipalities McMasterville, Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu and Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu. In Saint-Ours, the river is again characterized by a sudden drop before emptying into the Saint Lawrence River at Sorel-Tracy, southwest of Lake Saint-Pierre.

Several river islands are along the route of the Richelieu River. Arguably the most famous, Île aux Noix is in the Haut-Richelieu and houses Fort Lennox, considered a national historic site of Canada. Downstream, the Sainte-Thérèse Island near Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (in Saint-Luc&#x27;s sector), is the largest island on the Richelieu (its length is about and a maximum width of ). Formerly agricultural, it is now largely residential. It previously was the site of Fort Sainte Thérèse, built in 1665, but this was abandoned at the end of the 18th century and has now disappeared.

The Richelieu is one of three rivers flowing from Quebec south to north, the other two being the Châteauguay and Chaudière. Ice jams can form in the spring with the melting of ice in the south while the north is still frozen, causing floods.

== Geology ==

The valley of the Richelieu river is based on sedimentary rocks formed during the Cambrian of the Paleozoic era around 450 million years ago. The bedrock consists of shale clay and sandstone. The shales are sedimentary rocks from the mechanical disintegration of preexisting rocks. The sandstones are composed of quartz grains joined together and are always the result of deposition of shoreline.

The Utica shale usually contain an abundance of mica flakes and important content of quartz. The Utica shale is especially conducive to shale gas exploitation. Those of Lorraine group are dark gray color, and contain also sandstone lenses up to thick. These are the rocks of the Lorraine Group (sub-formation Breault) that cover most of the area. This group (sub-formation Chambly) contains the younger sedimentary rocks of the region: a series of shales and &quot;calcaireuses&quot; that turn red in the upper parts.

Historically, the formation of rocks in the region is due to its immersion, towards the end of the Ordovician geological era, which led to the establishment of marine sediments. Then raised by tectonic forces, the entire region has been subjected to a long erosion since the end of the Ordovician to the late Tertiary. Subsequently, after being covered with a thick layer of ice during the Quaternary, the lowlands of the St. Lawrence was overwhelmed by the Champlain Sea in the wake of the collapse of the foundation underlying, therefore, the weight of glaciers. After dropping clays and sands, the sea had to decline, following the recovery of the base, and left the area in its current state.

The valley has a few pronounced relief that is covered with a large clay deposit of up to thick. The lowlands were once part of plain of alluviums of St. Lawrence valley, greater than it is today. In a relatively recent geological time, glaciation changed the relief which subsequently was reduced by sediment deposits dating from the post-glacial of Champlain Sea. The most prominent of the watershed of the river geological formation is also formed by the Monteregian Hills. In addition, nearly half of the banks of the Richelieu River are kept in natural state.

Regarding the hydrogeology of the area, there are two major classes of surficial: permeable and little or no permeability. In the first case, we find sand and gravel formations for the establishment of wells that can theoretically power a community network or industry. In the second case, there are formation that permit at most the implementation of individual wells. A third category has emerged, that of permeable surficial buried underlying impermeable horizon, which are often highly productive aquifers.
Permeable surficial sand and gravel together from various sources and represent 18 percent of the entire region.
The little furniture or not permeable deposits consist of unconsolidated sediments which occupy 62 percent of the area. It includes the compact clay or silty matrix till, glaciolacustrine sediments for the Champlain Sea clay, fine current and organic sediment floodplain sediments.

==History==

Indigenous occupation

The Richelieu River was territory of the Iroquois and Abenaki, confederacies whose peoples were primarily based to the west and south, and the east and north, respectively.

French explorers

In 1535, the French explorer Jacques Cartier discovered the mouth of Richelieu River, during his second voyage in New France (Canada). Samuel de Champlain and his team reached the mouth of the river in 1603. Champlain returned to the river in 1608 and in 1609, exploring upriver and through Lake Champlain to modern-day Albany, New York.

Toponymy

The river was formerly known as &quot;Masoliantekw&quot;, which means &quot;water where there is plenty of food&quot; in Abenaki. Because of their encounters with the Iroquois nations along this way, the French called it the &quot;Riviere Iroquois&quot; at the beginning of the colony. Some early journals and maps refer to the lower river as the Sorel River. It was named for the powerful Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642), Minister of Louis XIII, who is also the namesake of Fort Richelieu. Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s tenure as chief minister coincided with much of the early period of the permanent French settlement of the Quebec region of New France in the first half of the 17th century.

Five forts

Already an important pathway for the Iroquois, particularly the easternmost nation of the Mohawk, the Richelieu River soon became one for French traders as well. The French regime built five forts along its length: Fort Richelieu at its mouth, Fort St. Louis (or Fort Chambly) in Chambly, Fort Sainte Thérèse and Fort Saint-Jean upriver, and Fort Ste. Anne on the Isle La Motte, Vermont, in Lake Champlain near its source.

In the 17th century, the repeated attacks by the Iroquois endangered the existence of New France. The colonists built their first military posts: Fort Richelieu in Sorel and Fort Saint-Jean. The latter, built in 1666, became the developing center of the city of Saint-Jean, today Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.

In the 18th century, the region was a strategic location increasingly coveted by both the French and British colonial empires. The two powers wanted to expand their territory and control the lucrative fur trade. After defeating France in the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War in North America), Great Britain took over its territory of New France east of the Mississippi River in 1763.

Between 1819 and 1829, the British built Fort Lennox on an island of the Richelieu River, near the Canada-U.S. border, to prevent against possible attacks from Americans, whom they had fought during the War of 1812. The British and French built large fortified posts, as shown by Fort Lennox at Île aux Noix, Fort Sainte Thérèse, and Fort St. Louis (or Fort Chambly).

The security offered by the forts and the fertile lands of the river attracted farmers. In the early nineteenth century the region of Haut-Richelieu got its nickname, the &quot;Valley of the strongholds&quot; (&quot;Vallée des forts&quot;).

After the period of the British conquest of New France in 1759–1760, and after the American War of Independence by the Thirteen Colonies (1776–1783), the Crown offered British military and Loyalists land for their service and in compensation for losses in what was now the United States. Numerous new settlers chose the banks of the Richelieu. During the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837, the battles of Saint-Denis and Saint-Charles occurred along the Richelieu.

Economy

During the 19th century, the Richelieu became an important economic thoroughfare instead of a path for war. In 1843, the construction of the Chambly Canal was completed, bypassing the rapids and allowing easier transportation of export products such as sawlogs, pulp, hay, and coal from Canada to the United States. Following the first channel, a network of channels was formed. These allowed those traversing the Richelieu to access the Hudson River and then New York. Sorel and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, which were both incorporated in the 1850s, arose as a direct result of the increased traffic on the Richelieu.

Railroad development

However, by the end of the 19th century railroads had largely replaced the river as commercial arteries. A tragic intersection of the two modes of transport occurred in 1864 when a train plunged off a swing bridge into the river after missing a red signal, killing 99 people.

Tourist industry

Tourists visit New York and Montreal through the river. Its contribution to regional prosperity is crucial and, in the middle of the century, Saint-Jean became the most important inner harbour of Quebec and Canada. The resort has largely replaced the business generated by the Richelieu which is considered a &quot;heritage corridor&quot;.

The river, which crosses densely populated areas as well as several agricultural areas is ecologically challenged, especially in the Chambly Basin. Measures concerning wastewater treatment reduced the presence of certain pollutants in recent years.

The Richelieu River caused extensive flooding during the spring of 2011, damaging or destroying more than 3,000 homes in Quebec and at least 750 in Vermont.

==Recreation==

Although its commercial significance has waned, the Richelieu has remained an important recreational waterway. The Chambly Canal (9 locks) permits pleasure boats to bypass the rapids at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Chambly. The Champlain Canal and Lake Champlain form the U.S. portion of the Lakes to Locks Passage, linking with the Hudson River and allowing navigation using the Richelieu between the St. Lawrence River and New York City and the Erie Canal.

The Piste cyclable du Canal-de-Chambly is a bicycle path that follows the towpath along the canal. The bike path is part of Quebec&#x27;s Route Verte bicycle path network. The canal is a national historic site operated by Parks Canada. The agency also manages other national historic sites along the river: Fort Chambly, Fort Ste. Thérèse, and St. Ours Canal.

Given the rich historical past of the region, the Richelieu River brings in its banks and its islands several sites, some of which are owned by Parks Canada National Historic Site Canal Chambly National Historic Site the Fort Lennox, the Fort Saint-Jean. As for the national historic site of Fort Chambly, it receives every year thousands of visitors during the 20Bière% 20and% 20Saveurs http://www.bieresetsaveurs.com/ celebrated the first days of September. In addition, the curious visitor to learn more about the history of the region could go to 20of% 20Top-Richelieu http://www.museeduhaut-richelieu.com/accueilmhr.html, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.

Fishing

The Richelieu, which is home to more than 50 species of fish, offers excellent sport fishing opportunities. Important sport species include northern pike, longnose gar, bowfin, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, carp, and black crappie. But the Richelieu also hosts several threatened or endangered species, such as the copper redhorse, river redhorse, and lake sturgeon, so fishing seasons and capture limits are regulated.

Since agricultural products Montérégie enjoy an enviable reputation, many restaurateurs settle near the Richelieu River to combine fine dining and picturesque landscape. True country of maple and apple cider and sugar shacks abound in the area.

== Hinterland ==

In urban and agricultural areas, there are mainly small mammals such as skunks, raccoon, squirrel and marmots. Forest areas, which represent 16% of the land in the watershed, host a variety of wildlife: there are among others American mink, deer, beaver, frogs and several species of turtles including the softshell turtle, which is an endangered species.

But the wildlife species most frequently sighted are birds. Because the river flows in a north-south axis, it is a migration corridor and one can observe several migrating birds. A staging area is located near Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and depending on the time of year, birdswatchers can see various species of birds. For example, in the fall, visitors can see the arrival of thousands of geese and ducks. One can also see the loggerhead shrike (an endangered species), as well as the peregrine and golden eagle (classified as a vulnerable species), and cerulean warblers, to name but a few.

Regarding the flora, the catchment of the River belongs to the bioclimatic domain maple-hickory hickory. It includes among others sugar maple and silver maple of hickory hickory of bur oak and oak bicolor of American elms and black ash, and several bushes and herbaceous. Of these, several are considered vulnerable or endangered. This is the case of the aplectrelle winter (Aplectrum hyemale), the leek (Allium tricoccum) and Canada lily (Lilium canadense).

In the late 1990s, there was the presence of water chestnut at the mouth of the river. This invasive species threaten to stifle the fauna and flora, as it multiplies at lightning speed. The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks of Quebec struggle to get rid of, and indeed a breakout campaign began in 2001. Partners, such as CIME Haut-Richelieu has controlled the invasion of this plant in the harvesting.

=== Fish ===

The Richelieu River is home to more than fifty species of fish. Many of them are considered threatened or endangered as copper redhorse, river redhorse and sturgeon. One of the last spawning of copper redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi), a species endemic in Quebec is also found in the river. Other species, such as goby, are exogenous. In fact, they come from an external medium and were accidentally introduced into the ecosystem, often water discharge ballast vessels that ply the St. Lawrence River. Considered harmful or invasive, they colonize the water, funds and compete with native species (local) and a threat to the integrity of the ecosystem river.

During the last decade, several methods have been implemented to protect endangered species. These projects include 2001, the fish ladder Vianney-Legendre which was built to help fish to pass the dam canal Saint-Ours. Named to honor the memory of Vianney-Legendre, renowned ichthyologist, the structure of an innovative nature has been designed to accommodate different species of fish, especially those threatened. This scale can even be used to raise awareness of the endangered species recovery. In 2002, the wildlife refuge Pierre-Étienne Fortin (naturalist who first described the copper redhorse) was created to protect a breeding copper redhorse. Access to the refuge is prohibited during the breeding season which runs from late June to late July. Finally, every summer since 2006, as part of a patrol project established by the Committee for consultation and development of the basin of the River (COVABAR) sensitizing agents plying the river in order to inform boaters the precarious situation of the copper redhorse and remind them regulations and measures in place to protect her.

In addition, invasive species and increasing human presence are not only responsible for the fragility of some populations. According to a report from the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) conducted in 1998, the presence of pollutants and toxic agents in the waters of the river is also a &quot;stressful&quot; for fish. In several places in the river, a disturbing proportion of fish (over 13%) had abnormalities, which would signal a &quot;precarious state of health&quot; of the community ichthyological. However, the significant presence of fish-eating fish and some vulnerable species such as banded killifish, brought MDDEP to maintain the integrity index fish &quot;average&quot; (except in the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, where he was considered &quot;low&quot;). Chub black chin, stonecat and lamprey East are also part of sentinel species in the watershed of the Richelieu River, like copper redhorse, whose presence is an indication of the quality of water and aquatic. The data presented in the 1998 report are still used as a reference in 2011.

The fragility of some ecosystems does not preclude the practice of sports and leisure activities. Some fish from the river can reach impressive and relevant to angling sizes. This activity is regulated, however : regular and sectoral restrictions and daily bag limits may apply between other sturgeons, the knights, millers and striped bass.

<doc id="276834" wikidata="Q20151" url="?curid=276834" title="Li Ka-shing">
<text>Sir Ka-shing Li (; born 29 July 1928) is a Hong Kong billionaire business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is the senior advisor for CK Hutchison Holdings and CK Asset Holdings, after he retired from the Chairman of the Board in May 2018; through it, he is an investor, developer, and operator of the largest health and beauty retailer in Asia and Europe. In July 2023 Li was the 33rd richest person in the world, with an estimated net wealth of . In the March 2024 Forbes list of The Richest People In The World Li Ka-shing was ranked 38th with a net worth of $37.3 billion.

Li invests in a wide array of industries, including transportation, real estate, financial services, retail, and energy and utilities. His conglomerate company Cheung Kong Holdings invests in many sectors of the Hong Kong economy and made up 4% of the aggregate market capitalisation of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; and the Forbes family honoured Li Ka-shing with the first ever Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award on 5 September 2006, in Singapore. In spite of his wealth, Li has cultivated a reputation for leading a frugal no-frills lifestyle, and is known to wear simple black dress shoes and an inexpensive Seiko wristwatch. He lived in the same house for decades, in what has now become one of the most expensive districts in Hong Kong, Deep Water Bay in Hong Kong Island. Li is also a philanthropist, donating billions of dollars to charity and various other philanthropic causes, and owning the second largest private foundation in the world after Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, Forbes put Li in the list of most generous philanthropists outside of the US.

== Early life ==
Li was born in Chao&#x27;an, Chaozhou in Guangdong Province in 1928 to Teochew parents named Li Yun-ching (1898–1943) and Cheung Bik-chin (1893–1984). Li and his family fled to Hong Kong in 1940 as refugees from the Sino-Japanese war. Owing to his father&#x27;s death from tuberculosis, he was forced to leave school at the age of 15 and found a job in a plastics trading company where he worked 16 hours a day. In 1950 he started his own company, Cheung Kong Industries. From manufacturing plastics, Li developed his company into a leading real estate investment company in Hong Kong that was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. Cheung Kong expanded by acquiring Hutchison Whampoa and Hongkong Electric Holdings in 1979 and 1985 respectively.

==Business career==
===Plastics manufacturing===
In 1950, after learning how to operate a plant, Li founded a plastic manufacturing company in Hong Kong with personal savings and funds borrowed from relatives. Li avidly read trade publications and business news before deciding to supply the world with high quality plastic flowers at low prices. Li learned the technique of mixing colour with plastics that resemble real flowers. After retooling his shop, he prepared the plant for a visit from a large foreign buyer. Fortunately for Li, the buyer placed a large order and a few years later, Li grew to be the largest supplier of plastic flowers in Asia and made a fortune selling them.

===Real estate===
In 1958, believing rents would continue to rise, Li decided to purchase a site and develop his own factory building. An opportunity to acquire more land arrived after the 1967 riots when many people fled Hong Kong, and, as a result, property prices plummeted. Li believed the political crisis would be temporary and property prices would eventually rise, and bought land from the fleeing residents at low prices. In 1971, Li officially named his real estate development company Cheung Kong (). Cheung Kong Holdings was publicly listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. During board meetings, Li stated on a number of occasions his goal of surpassing the Jardines-owned Hongkong Land as a leading developer.

The successful bid by Cheung Kong for development sites above the Central and Admiralty MTR stations in 1977 was the key to challenging Hongkong Land as the premier property developer in Hong Kong. Despite its size, Jardines decided in the 1980s to protect itself from hostile takeover by Li or other outside investors. The company implemented a cross-shareholding structure that was designed to place control in the hands of Britain&#x27;s Keswick family despite their less than 10% holdings in the group. In 1984, the company also moved its legal domicile from Hong Kong to another British overseas territory – Bermuda, in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997.

In an effort to drive forward divestitures of assets in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, Li agreed to sell The Center, the fifth-tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong. With a value of (), the deal constitutes the biggest ever office space real estate sale in the Asia-Pacific region. Li sold the Century Link complex in Shanghai for US$2.95 billion, the second largest transaction for a single building, according to the Financial Times.

In 1979, Li purchased a major stake in Hutchison Whampoa from Hong Kong Bank through Cheung Kong.

===Retail===
A subsidiary of CK Hutchison, AS Watson (ASW), is a retail operator with over 15,000 stores. Its portfolio encompasses retail brands in Europe such as Superdrug (UK), Marionnaud (France), Kruidvat (Benelux countries), and in Asia including health and beauty retailer Watson&#x27;s store and wine cellars et al., PARKnSHOP supermarkets (and spin-off brands), and Fortress electrical appliance stores. ASW also produces and distributes water products and beverages in the region.

===Asset trading===
CK Hutchison builds up new businesses and sells them off when shareholder value can be created. Profits were obtained in the sale of its interest in Orange to Mannesmann Group in 1999, making a profit of . In 2006, Li sold 20% of Hutchison&#x27;s ports business to Singapore rival PSA Corporation, making a profit on a deal.

Group subsidiary Hutchison Telecommunications sold a controlling stake of 67% in Hutchison Essar, a joint venture Mobile operator in India, to Vodafone for .

===Internet and technology===
Li has also made a foray into the technology business, where his investment and venture capital firm Horizons Ventures is specifically allocated towards backing new internet and technology startup firms, and bought a stake in doubleTwist. His other firm, the Li Ka Shing Foundation bought a 0.8% stake in social networking website :Facebook for in two separate rounds, and invested an estimated in the music streaming service Spotify. Some time between late 2009 and early 2010, Li Ka-shing led a Series B round of financing for Siri Inc.

In 2011, Horizons Ventures invested in Summly, a website-summarizing app. Notably, the investment made Nick D&#x27;Aloisio, Summly&#x27;s founder, the world&#x27;s youngest person to receive a venture capital investment at just fifteen years old. In 2012, Horizons Ventures invested in Wibbitz, a company that provides a text-to-video technology that can automatically convert any article post or feed on the web into a video in a matter of seconds. In August 2012, Li acquired a stake in Ginger Software Incorporated. In 2013, Horizons Ventures invested in bitcoin payment company BitPay.

In February 2015, Horizons Ventures participated in a Series C funding round in Zoom Video Communications. Later in the year, Li participated in a Series D round in Impossible Foods. In 2016, he continued investments in technology companies and Horizons Ventures led a Series A round in Blockstream, the leader in blockchain related technologies, and also invested in a startup incubator fund Expa, that works with the founders to build new companies.

In September 2017, Li worked with Alibaba&#x27;s Jack Ma to bring AlipayHK, a digital wallet service, to Hong Kong.

===Water===
Through CK Infrastructure Holdings Limited, Li owns 75% of British water supplier Northumbrian Water, the remaining 25% being held by US private equity firm KKR. Despite losses of ~£22 million between March 2022 and July 2023, CK Group and KKR between them took £159 million in dividends from the organisation which in the same period paid its chief executive, Heidi Mottram, $1.24 million. In 2022 the business was fined £240,000 for discharging untreated sewage into a water course in northeast England over a period of two days.

===Australian tax dispute===
In 2013 a claim was lodged by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) against Cheung Kong Infrastructure (CKI) to pay approximately in unpaid tax, penalties and interest relating to tax disputes concerning SA Power Networks and Victoria Power Networks. The dispute was resolved in 2015 when CKI entered into an agreement with the ATO. No penalty was levied against CKI and a sum of approximately was refunded from the previously paid to the ATO by CKI.

=== Retirement ===
After his almost-70-year reign over CK Hutchison Holdings and CK Asset Holdings, Li announced his retirement on 16 March 2018 and the decision to pass control of his empire to his son, Victor Li. He is still involved in the conglomerate as a senior advisor.

===Others===
Besides business through his flagship companies CK Asset Holdings and CK Hutchison Holdings, Li Ka-shing has also personally invested extensively in real estate in Singapore and Canada. He was the single largest shareholder of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the fifth largest bank in Canada, until the sale of his share in 2005 (with all proceedings donated, see below). He is also the majority shareholder of a major energy company, Husky Energy, based in Alberta, Canada. Husky was acquired by Cenovus in 2021, and Li owns 27.2% of the newly merged company.

In January 2005, Li announced plans to sell his stake in the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, with all proceeds going to private charitable foundations established by Li, including the Li Ka Shing Foundation in Hong Kong and the Li Ka Shing (Canada) Foundation based in Toronto, Ontario. Li was the non-executive director of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation since 1980 and became deputy chairman of the bank in 1985. He was also Deputy Chairman of HSBC in 1991–1992.

According to Bloomberg, he had a net worth of in July 2021.

== Personal life ==
His two sons, Victor Li and Richard Li, are also figures in the Hong Kong business scene. Victor Li succeeded his father as Chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings and Chairman of CK Asset Holdings, while Richard Li is Chairman of PCCW, the largest telecom company in Hong Kong. They are both Canadian citizens. He is a follower of Buddhism.

Married to his first cousin, Chong Yuet-ming (1933–1990), they had a long period of marriage that lasted for 27–28 years from 1962 until her sudden death on New Year&#x27;s Day 1990 due to a suspected drug overdose (other sources name the cause as cardiac arrest). She was the daughter of his maternal uncle (mother&#x27;s younger brother), Cheung Jing-on (1908–1996) and his wife, Hew Bik-yin (1911–2002), who were also from the Chaoshan region. Both settled in British Hong Kong long before Li migrated to the city. 

Li is plainly dressed for a Hong Kong tycoon. In the 1990s, he wore a timepiece from Citizen Watch and plain ties. He later wore a Seiko. In 2016, he wore a Citizen watch.

His son Victor Li was kidnapped in 1996 on his way home after work by gangster Cheung Tze-keung (aka &quot;Big Spender&quot;). Li Ka-shing paid a ransom of directly to Cheung, who had come to his house. A report was never filed with Hong Kong police. Instead the case was pursued by mainland authorities, leading to Cheung&#x27;s execution in 1998, an outcome not possible under Hong Kong law. Rumours circulated of a deal between Li and the mainland.

==Awards and honours==
* Grand Bauhinia Medal
* Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire 
* Commandeur, Légion d&#x27;honneur
* Honorary Doctor of Laws, University of Hong Kong

==Politics==
For many years, he was considered to be a pro-Beijing figure. However, in recent years, tensions have been growing between Li and the mainland, especially with the rise of current China&#x27;s paramount leader Xi Jinping. During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, he refused to outright condemn the protesters, instead urging for peace and calling on the authorities to respond to the protesters humanely.

On 4 August 2011 at the interim results announcement for Hutchison Whampoa, Li endorsed Henry Tang for the forthcoming chief executive election. Then Li said &quot;You all can be just like me, one-person-one-vote ().&quot; The media then looked at Li in disbelief, and pointed out that regular citizens do not get one-person-one-vote. Li then tried to laugh it off and said &quot;maybe in 2017 they will have one-person-one-vote to choose the chief executive, I probably just said it a little early.&quot; However, Li was criticised by Chinese official state-run press agency Xinhua for being ambiguous in his opposition to the Umbrella movement protests and his support for Leung. Later, prior to the Legco vote, Li said that the largest threat to Hong Kong&#x27;s future was if the government failed to ensure passage of the 2014–15 round of political reform.

Li&#x27;s business empire has a presence around the world, including China. Li came under attack from the &quot;Global Times&quot; newspaper in early 2015, when his companies put out word that it was considering selling prime Shanghai and Beijing properties. It became apparent that Li aimed at re-weighting his asset portfolio to more stable and transparent markets in the West. Concerted attacks ensued and went into a crescendo as China&#x27;s economy slowed down dramatically in the second half of the year, and the central government sought a way to stem the capital outflows. Specific reproaches were that his asset disposals were &quot;an act of ingratitude&quot; and &quot;immoral at such a sensitive juncture&quot;. &quot;Security Times&quot;, a &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; publication, estimated that Li has sold at least worth of assets since 2014. Li&#x27;s holding companies denied divesting in China, saying that its asset disposals were being undertaken in the ordinary course of business. The attacks stopped abruptly several weeks later, when editorials in official publications such as &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and &quot;Beijing Youth Daily&quot; took a neutral stance in unison.

<text>Mac&#x27;s Convenience Stores (known colloquially as Mac&#x27;s or Mac&#x27;s Milk) was a chain of convenience stores in Canada. The company was divided into three geographic business units: eastern Canada, central Canada, and western Canada. It had been owned and operated by Alimentation Couche-Tard since 1999. Since 2017, it served as one of Couche-Tard&#x27;s two main banners in English-speaking Canada, alongside Circle K. The brand has been phased out in favour of the Circle K banner.

==History==
Kenneth (Ken) and Carl McGowen incorporated Mac&#x27;s Milk Limited in Ontario on April 4, 1962. On July 5, 1963, Silverwood Dairies Limited acquired 40% of the shares of Mac&#x27;s Milk Limited, and increased its holding to 80% on March 29, 1968, and 100% on January 12, 1972.

In 1971, the company purchased 18 convenience stores operating under the &quot;Little Z Convenience Stores&quot; banner from Zehrs Markets. In 1974, it bought thirteen Mini-Mart convenience stores in Vancouver from a subsidiary of George Weston Limited and seven Starlite Variety Stores operating in Windsor, Ontario.
The company was renamed &quot;Mac&#x27;s Convenience Stores Limited&quot; on May 7, 1975. In 1976, Silverwood Dairies Limited purchased shares of Royal Oak Dairy, including operations of convenience stores under the Bantam and Astro names. 

In 1994, the company sold most of the Mac&#x27;s stores in Quebec to Alimentation Couche-Tard Ltd. Mac&#x27;s stores in Quebec were renamed &quot;Dépan-Escompte Couche-Tard&quot;. Silcorp, the parent company of Mac&#x27;s, acquired 163 Southern Ontario stores, and assets of rival Becker&#x27;s in November 1996. On April 14, 1999, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. purchased Silcorp (including the Mac&#x27;s and Becker&#x27;s chains). Mac&#x27;s dropped its longtime cat logo, and replaced it with Couche-Tard&#x27;s owl logo.

On September 23, 2015, Alimentation Couche-Tard announced that as part of a global re-branding, all Mac&#x27;s stores would be converted to Couche-Tard&#x27;s Circle K banner; the Canadian renaming began in May 2017.

Some stores across Canada continue to use the Mac&#x27;s logo.

==Marketing==

The original mascot for Mac&#x27;s was a cat named MacTavish (seen above), wearing a Tam o&#x27; shanter and a kilt, holding a jug of milk. Following Mac&#x27;s acquisition by Couche-Tard in 1999, it was changed to the winking owl named Hibou, which was the mascot for Couche-Tard&#x27;s convenience stores and gas stations in Quebec.

<doc id="276837" wikidata="Q119781" url="?curid=276837" title="Point of sail">
<text>A point of sail is a sailing craft&#x27;s direction of travel under sail in relation to the true wind direction over the surface.

The principal points of sail roughly correspond to 45° segments of a circle, starting with 0° directly into the wind. For many sailing craft 45° on either side of the wind is a &quot;no-go&quot; zone, where a sail is unable to mobilize power from the wind. Sailing on a course as close to the wind as possible—approximately 45°—is termed &quot;beating&quot;, a point of sail when the sails are &quot;close-hauled&quot;. At 90° off the wind, a craft is on a &quot;beam reach&quot;. The point of sail between beating and a beam reach is called a &quot;close reach&quot;. At 135° off the wind, a craft is on a &quot;broad reach&quot;. At 180° off the wind (sailing in the same direction as the wind), a craft is &quot;running downwind&quot;.

A given point of sail (beating, close reach, beam reach, broad reach, and running downwind) is defined in reference to the true wind—the wind felt by a stationary observer. The motive power, and thus appropriate position of the sails, is determined by the apparent wind: the wind relative to an observer on the sailing craft. The apparent wind is the combined effect of the velocities of the true wind and of the sailing craft.

A sail with the airflow parallel to its surface, while angled into the apparent wind, acts substantially like a wing with lift as a force acting perpendicular to its surface. A sail with the apparent wind perpendicular to its surface, acts substantially like a parachute with the drag on the sail as the dominant force. As a sailing craft transitions from close-hauled to running downwind, the lifting force decreases and the drag force increases. At the same time, the resistance to sidewards motion needed to keep the craft on course also decreases, along with the sideways tipping force.

There is a zone of approximately 45° on either side of the true wind, where a sail cannot generate lift, called the &quot;no-go zone&quot;. The angle encompassed by the no-go zone depends on the airfoil efficiency of the craft&#x27;s sails and the craft&#x27;s lateral resistance on the surface (from hydrofoils, outriggers, or a keel in the water, runners on ice, or wheels on land). A craft remaining in its no-go zone will slow to a stop—it will be &quot;in irons&quot;.

== The points of sail ==
The recognized points of sail are judged relative to the true wind direction. The subcategories of these two situations include:

* Into the wind where a sailing craft is pointed directly upwind in the middle of the no-go zone, where sails cannot generate power.
* Close-hauled means a boat is sailing at the sharpest angle possible toward the wind without entering the no-go zone, where sailing isn&#x27;t possible.
* Reaching, including:
** Close reach: between close-hauled and a beam reach.
** Beam reach: the craft has the true wind at a right angle to its direction (on its beam).
** Broad reach: the true wind is coming from behind, but not directly behind.
* Running downwind where a craft has the wind coming from directly behind.
=== Into the wind ===

The range of directions into the wind, where a sailing craft cannot sail is called the &quot;no-go zone&quot;. A sailing craft cannot sail directly into the wind, nor on a course that is too close to the direction from which the wind is blowing, because the sails cannot generate lift in this no-go zone. A craft passing through the no-go zone to change tacks from one side to the other, must maintain momentum until its sails can draw power on the other side. If it remains in the no-go zone, it will slow to a stop and be &quot;in irons&quot;. This is called &quot;missing stays&quot;. To recover, that craft typically must return to its original tack and pick up sufficient speed to complete the maneuver. The span of the no-go zone depends on the efficiency of a sailing craft&#x27;s sails and its resistance to sideways motion in the water (using a keel or foils) on ice or on land, typically at an angle between 30 and 50 degrees from the wind.

A craft stopped in the no-go zone is said to be in irons. A square-rigged vessel in irons by accident is &quot;taken aback&quot; with the sails blown against the mast or &quot;laid aback&quot; if deliberate. In either case, the stopped vessel will be blown backwards, which with proper positioning of the rudder allows the vessel to point outside the no-go zone and resume forward motion, once the sails can draw power. Iceboats are often parked in irons with a brake applied to the ice to prevent motion. To commence sailing, the craft is guided to one side and boarded, once the sail can draw power.

=== Close-hauled ===

A sailing craft is said to be sailing close-hauled when its sails are trimmed in tightly and are acting &quot;substantially like a wing&quot;, relying on lift to propel the craft forward on a course as close to the wind as the sail can provide lift. This point of sail lets the sailing craft travel upwind, diagonally to the wind direction. 

The smaller the angle between the direction of the true wind and the course of the sailing craft, the higher the craft is said to &quot;point&quot;. A craft that can point higher or sail faster upwind is said to be more &quot;weatherly&quot;. &quot;Pinching&quot; occurs as a craft&#x27;s point of sail approaches the no-go zone and its speed falls off sharply.

==== Sailing to windward ====

In order to sail upwind, sailing craft must zig-zag across the direction of the oncoming wind, called beating to windward. The higher a vessel that can point into the wind, the shorter its &quot;course made good&quot; to an upwind destination. Beating upwind, a vessel alternates between having the wind come on the port and starboard sides (the port and starboard tack). Changing from one tack to the other, by steering through the wind direction, is called &quot;tacking&quot;, or &quot;going about&quot;.

=== Reaching ===
A craft sailing with the true wind on its side (within limits) is &quot;reaching&quot;. Wind is flowing over the surface of the sail, creating lift (like a wing) to propel the craft. Because lift is more powerful than drag on this point of sail, sailing craft achieve their highest speeds on a reach. A variety of high-performance sailing craft sail fastest on a broad reach with the sails close-hauled at speeds several times the true windspeed. Depending on the angle of the true wind with respect to the course sailed, a reach may be &quot;close&quot;, &quot;beam&quot;, or &quot;broad&quot;, as follows:

* A close reach is a course closer to the true wind (more upwindwards) than a beam reach, but below close-hauled; i.e., any angle between a beam reach and close-hauled. The sails are trimmed in (hauled towards the centreline of the hull), but not as tightly as for a close-hauled course.

* A beam reach is when the true wind is at a right angle to the direction of motion (so called because the wind is parallel to the cross-hull beams, if any; see beam).

* A broad reach is when the wind is coming from behind the sailing craft at an angle. This represents a range of wind angles, between a beam reach and running downwind (see next paragraph). On a sailboat (but not an iceboat) the sails are eased out away from the sailing craft, but not as much as on a downwind run. If the sailcraft points any further downwind, the sails cease acting substantially like a wing.

=== Running downwind ===
Sailing with the wind or &quot;running before the wind&quot;, the sails generate power primarily through drag (like a parachute) with the true wind directly from behind the sailing craft. A sailing craft running more downwind than a broad reach cannot attain a speed faster than the true wind. 

However, higher-performance sailing craft achieve a higher velocity made good downwind, by sailing on whatever broad reach is most efficient on that particular craft, and jibing as needed. The longer course is offset by the faster speed. For instance, if a vessel sails alternately in the directions 45° from the downwind direction, it will sail (≈1.4) times farther than it would if it sailed dead downwind. However, as long as it can sail faster than 1.4 times its dead downwind speed, the indirect route will allow it to arrive at a chosen point sooner.

Craft running downwind increase power from the sails by increasing total area presented to the following wind, sometimes by putting out sails that adapt well to the purpose, such as a spinnaker on a fore-and-aft rigged vessel. Another technique is to place the jib to windward (opposite to the main sail)—called &quot;wing on wing&quot; or one of several other terms—for a fore-and-aft vessel going dead downwind. In light winds, certain square-rigged vessels may set studding sails, sails that extend outwards from the yardarms, to create a larger sail area for points of sail, ranging from downwind to a close reach.

==True wind versus apparent wind==

True wind (VT) combines with the sailing craft&#x27;s velocity (VB) to be the &quot;apparent wind velocity&quot; (VA); the air velocity experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. Apparent wind velocity provides the motive power for the sails on any given point of sail. The apparent wind is equal to the true wind velocity for a stopped craft; it may be faster than the true wind speed on some points of sail, or it may be slower e.g. when a sailing craft sails dead downwind.

The speed of sailboats through the water is limited by the resistance that results from hull drag in the water. Ice boats typically have the least resistance to forward motion of any sailing craft; consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sail boats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where it&#x27;s possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind.

For a sailboat, point of sail significantly affects the lateral force to which the boat is subjected. The higher the boat points into the wind, the stronger the lateral force, which results in both increased leeway and heeling. Leeway, the effect of the boat moving sideways through the water, can be counteracted by a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and rudder. Lateral force also induces heeling in a sailboat, which is resisted by the shape and configuration of the hull (or hulls, in the case of catamarans) and the weight of ballast, and can be further resisted by the weight of the crew. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become reduced.
On ice boats and sand yachts, lateral forces are countered by the lateral resistance of the blades on ice or of the wheels on sand, and of their distance apart, which generally prevents heeling.

<doc id="276844" wikidata="Q1503652" url="?curid=276844" title="Jibe">
<text>A jibe (US) or gybe (Britain) is a sailing maneuver whereby a sailing craft reaching downwind turns its stern through the wind, which then exerts its force from the opposite side of the vessel. It stands in contrast with tacking, whereby the sailing craft turns its bow through the wind.

In this maneuver, the mainsail will cross the center of the boat while the jib is pulled to the other side of the boat. If a spinnaker is up, its pole will have to be manually moved to the other side, to remain opposite the mainsail. In a dinghy, raising the centerboard can increase the risk of capsizing during what can be a somewhat violent maneuver, although the opposite is true of a dinghy with a flat, planing hull profile: raising the centerboard reduces heeling moment during the maneuver and so reduces the risk of capsize.

The other way to change the side of the boat that faces the wind is turning the bow of the boat into, and then through, the direction of the wind. This operation is known as tacking or coming about. Tacking more than 180° to avoid a jibe is sometimes referred to as a &quot;chicken jibe&quot;.

An uncontrolled, accidental jibe that allows the mainsail boom to swing across the cockpit may endanger crew and rigging. Therefore, accidental jibes are to be avoided while the proper technique must be applied so as to control the maneuver. For square-rigged ships, this maneuver is called wearing ship.

== Use ==
Many sailboats move significantly faster when sailing on a broad reach than when running (sailing straight downwind). Thus the increased speed of a zig-zag course, jibing into successive broad reaches, can more than make up for the extra distance such craft take over a straight downwind course. Jibing is also common in racing, which often uses a triangular course marked with buoys; the most direct way of rounding a buoy may be to jibe.

Jibing occurs less commonly than tacking, since a sailboat can sail straight downwind, whereas it cannot sail directly into the wind and has to sail a zig-zag course at alternating angles into the wind. However, a jibe can generally be completed more quickly than a tack because the boat never turns into the wind, and thus a jibing boat&#x27;s sails are always powered, whereas a tacking boat&#x27;s luffing sails are un-powered while the bow crosses through or &quot;into&quot; the direction of the wind.

&quot;Wearing ship&quot; is the jibing-equivalent maneuver for a square-rigged ship when its crew wishes to avoid the difficulties and hazards of tacking. Light winds, heavy seas, worn-out gear, and poor vessel or crew performance are all reasons a ship may choose to wear instead of tack. Compared to boats with a fore-and-aft rig, a square rigger can jibe without any difficulty or risk of accident. However, since these craft cannot point close to the wind, they may find it difficult to maintain turning and forward momentum as the bow passes through the large no-go zone when tacking. If the ship loses steering way, it can be &quot;taken aback&quot;, with the wind pressing on the forward surface of the sails and caught in irons. By driving the vessel backwards through the water, this puts excessive strain on the ship&#x27;s masts, spars and rigging, could break the rudder, and in severe weather could dismast the ship. With tacking to windward carrying these risks, in some situations shipmasters considered it quicker and safer to travel upwind by executing a series of jibes, turning the vessel across the wind through 270 degrees rather than through the 90 degrees of a tack. This, however, would result in considerable ground lost to leeward with each jibe. Wearing has been judged to be unseamanlike except in heavy weather.

When running (sailing nearly directly downwind) in a sloop, one may &quot;jibe&quot; only the mainsail to the opposite side of the boat. This keeps both the main and jib exposed to the wind resulting in a more efficient use of wind. Setting the mainsail and the jib on opposite sides of the boat is often referred to as running &quot;goose-winged&quot;, &quot;gull-winged&quot;, or &quot;wing-and-wing&quot;. When running wing-and-wing, a light spinnaker pole or whisker pole is often used to hold the clew of the foresail out to the windward side of the boat.

== Dangers ==

A jibe can be dangerous in a fore-and-aft rigged boat because the sails are always completely filled by wind during the maneuver. As the direction of the wind crosses the boat&#x27;s centerline and the leeward side of the mainsail and boom suddenly become the new windward side the load on the sail and mainsheet remain high; if uncontrolled, they can swing across the deck at high speed, striking and seriously injuring anyone standing in the path of the boom or its tackle. An uncontrolled boom slamming to the limit of its range may also put excessive stress on the rigging, can break the boom or standing rigging, or cause dismasting. A jibe can also result in a sudden change in the direction of heel, and can cause unexpected course changes due to the mainsail force changing from one side of the boat to the other.

==Technique==
A safe jibe can be aided by tensioning the boom vang (kicking strap) to prevent the boom from lifting. In high winds, sailing nearly directly downwind briefly before and after the jibe and making only small direction changes will produce less heeling force and reduce the tendency to round-up. In heavier gusts, the crew or skipper can sheet the boom in and force the boom across the boat by hand, holding the boom in position by locking the traveler or using a preventer. After the jibe has been completed, the course can then be changed to higher points of sail.

Because of the inherent dangers in jibing, communication among the crew is key. Typically three commands are issued by the helmsman: &quot;Prepare to jibe&quot; (or &quot;ready to jibe&quot;) warns everyone to remain clear of the boom and alerts crew to be in position to handle sheets and boom for all sails. &quot;Bearing away&quot; or &quot;jibing&quot; (similar to saying &quot;helm&#x27;s a-lee&quot; during a tack) indicates the helmsman is turning the boat (away from the wind) to start the jibe. &quot;Jibe-ho&quot; accompanies the start of the boom swing across the centerline.

Accidental jibes may occur when running dead downwind and the wind catches the leeward side of the sail. When the wind direction crosses the centerline of the boat without jibing the point of sail is referred to as &quot;by the lee&quot;. When sailing &quot;by the lee&quot; the outer edge of the mainsail is facing slightly into the wind. Rolling motion, slight changes in the boat heading or wind direction can cause an unexpected and surprising jibe, suddenly and forcefully flipping the mainsail to the opposite side of the boat. Do not sail &quot;by the lee&quot; except for brief durations (such as to avoid an obstacle), and only when keeping all crew clear of the boom swing and the arc of the mainsheet sweep. A crew member can be used to help hold the boom in place in smaller boats. When sailing directly downwind, unintentional jibes can also occur; diligent helmsmanship is required to prevent &quot;by the lee&quot; conditions and keeping clear of the boom sweep is advised. In larger stable boats, a preventer can help by keeping the boom held forward, preventing the boom motion of a jibe, especially in light winds. However, in high winds, the &quot;sheeting in action&quot; of a preventer can cause severe rounding up on the other tack. Smaller boats may find that a backwinded sail is more heel inducing than allowing a jibe. See broach, Chinese gybe and death roll.

When sailing in high winds, a small boat or dinghy can capsize shortly after a jibe due to helmsman error (loss of direction control, or suddenly rounding into the wind too far) or tripping over the centerboard. It is partly for this second reason that centerboards are often lifted while sailing downwind even in non-planing hulls, the main reason being that a centreboard/keel is not needed for sailing downwind and simply adds to the drag of the hull. Raising the centreboard reduces drag and increases the boat&#x27;s speed.

As with most sailing training, it is particularly important to learn this maneuver in lighter winds, and practice in increasing winds and faster maneuvers gradually.

== For various sailing craft ==
The method of jibing sailing craft differs, depending on whether they are fore-and aft, square-rigged, a windsurfer, or a kitesurfer.
* &quot;Fore-and-aft rig&quot; – A fore-and-aft sail is set for the wind on one side for a given tack. As the wind changes across the stern and reaches the other side of the sail, the sail may be blown to the other side suddenly—unless it is shielded by other sails to windward. If the sail is supported with a boom, gaff or sprit the change may be violent—unless the sheets are tight—as the sail is blown to the other side. For a jib, the old leeward sheet is loosened as the stern turns through the wind and the old windward sheet is tightened as the new leeward sheet to allow the sail to draw wind. A jib is usually shielded by the mainsail in this process. The mainsail sheet is tightened to limit the sudden movement from one side to the other and then eased out, once the boat is safely on the opposite tack. On smaller craft, the boom may be controlled by hand.
* &quot;Spinnaker&quot; – Some sailboats use a &quot;symmetrical&quot; spinnaker—a three-sided, parachute-like sail—off the wind. The windward lower corner of a spinnaker is attached to a horizontal pole, coming from the mast to the lower corner of the sail—controlled by a line, called a &quot;guy&quot;—and the other lower corner is attached to a line that acts as a sheet. When jibing, the pole is disconnected from the mast and attached to the opposite lower corner. Upon establishment on the new tack, the end of the pole that was on the sail is connected to the mast as the former guy becomes the new sheet and the former sheet becomes the new guy. For high-performance craft with an &quot;asymmetrical&quot; spinnaker attached to a bow sprit, the sail is jibed in a manner similar to a jib.
* &quot;Square rig&quot; – As with any downwind change of course, the sails on a square rigger are adjusted with the vessel&#x27;s running rigging, using braces sheets. Only the jibs, staysails and the spanker need to be jibed, as on a fore-and-aft rig. The maneuver of changing tack with the wind passing across the stern of a square-rigged vessel is called &quot;wearing ship&quot;.
* &quot;Windsurfer rig&quot; – When sailors of windsurfers jibe, they use techniques like the &quot;carve jibe&quot; and the &quot;duck jibe&quot; or sail back winded then push the leech through the eye of the wind as in an upwind 360 or after ducking the sail to back winded. The carve jibe allows the sail to pivot away from the wind as the board is turned with the wind passing over the stern. A duck jibe is initiated on a beam reach and the sailor presses the sail towards the wind and passes the back end of the boom over to the other side, &quot;ducking&quot; under it.
* &quot;Kitesurfer rig&quot; – When changing tack while on a broad reach, a kitesurfer again rotates the kite to align with the new apparent wind as the board changes course with the stern through the eye of the wind while planing.

<doc id="276846" wikidata="Q1137321" url="?curid=276846" title="Onchocerciasis">
<text>Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a disease caused by infection with the parasitic worm &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot;. Symptoms include severe itching, bumps under the skin, and blindness. It is the second-most common cause of blindness due to infection, after trachoma.
The parasitic worm is spread by the bites of a black fly of the &quot;Simulium&quot; genus. Usually, many bites are required before infection occurs. These flies live near rivers, hence the common name of the disease, River blindness. Once inside a person, the worms create larvae that make their way out to the skin, where they can infect the next black fly that bites the person. There are a number of ways to make the diagnosis, including placing a biopsy of the skin in normal saline and watching for the larva to come out, looking in the eye for larvae, and looking within the bumps under the skin for adult worms.
A vaccine against the disease does not exist. Prevention is by avoiding being bitten by flies. This may include the use of insect repellent and proper clothing. Other efforts include those to decrease the fly population by spraying insecticides. Efforts to eradicate the disease by treating entire groups of people twice a year are ongoing in a number of areas of the world. Treatment of those infected is with the medication ivermectin every six to twelve months. This treatment kills the larvae but not the adult worms. The antibiotic doxycycline weakens the worms by killing an associated bacterium, &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, and is recommended by some as well. The lumps under the skin may also be removed by surgery.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 2017, about 20.9 million people were infected with onchocerciasis, and an estimated 1.15 million have some vision loss from the infection. Most infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, although cases have also been reported in Yemen and isolated areas of Central and South America. In 1915, the physician Rodolfo Robles first linked the worm to eye disease. It is listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a neglected tropical disease. In 2013 Colombia became the first country to eradicate the disease.

==Cause==
Onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection caused by the roundworm species &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot;. The larvae of &quot;O. volvulus&quot; enter a human host when an infected female adult fly from the genus &quot;Simulium&quot; bites them. After that, it can take up to three months for the worms to mature under the skin of their host. The worms mainly get nutrients for growth in humans from blood, but they have also been seen to rely on other bodily fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. It is common to see nodules formed in the skin where the adult worms reside and mate. However, these worms will often travel throughout the body using blood vessels in connective tissues and even settle behind the cornea.

===Life cycle===
The life of the parasite can be traced through the black fly and the human hosts in the following steps:

# A &quot;Simulium&quot; female black fly takes a blood meal on an infected human host and ingests microfilaria.
# The microfilaria enter the black fly&#x27;s gut and thoracic flight muscles, progressing into the first larval stage (J1.).
# The larvae mature into the second larval stage (J2.) and move to the proboscis and into the saliva in its third larval stage (J3.). Maturation takes about seven days.
# The black fly takes another blood meal, passing the larvae into the next human host&#x27;s blood.
# The larvae migrate to the subcutaneous tissue and undergo two more molts. They form nodules as they mature into adult worms over six to 12 months.
# After maturing, adult male worms mate with female worms in the subcutaneous tissue to produce between 700 and 1,500 microfilariae daily.
# The microfilaria migrate to the skin during the day, and the black flies only feed during the day, so the parasite is in a prime position for the female fly to ingest it. Black flies take blood meals to ingest these microfilaria to restart the cycle.

==Signs and symptoms==
The larvae can move through the body without triggering a response from the host&#x27;s immune system, so some people who are infected with the parasite experience no symptoms; the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that in 2017 there were at least 20.9 million people infected worldwide, of which 14.6 million had skin disease symptoms and 1.15 million experienced symptoms that impacted vision. After a blackfly bite, it can take 12–18 months for the larvae to develop into mature adult worms that will produce their larvae, which is what leads to the development of symptoms. Almost all the clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis are due to localized host inflammatory responses to dead or dying microfilariae (larvae). The signs and symptoms of onchocerciasis are usually divided into two categories, skin and eye symptoms.

Skin symptoms will develop years before any vision problems. These symptoms include:

* Intense itching
* Swelling
* Inflammation
* Depigmentation
* Hyperpigmentation
* Rash
* Nodules under the skin
* Skin atrophy
* Hanging groin (folds of inelastic atrophic skin in the groin associated with enlarged lymph nodes)

Eye symptoms include:

* Vision impairment, low vision, or permanent blindness.
* Clouding of the cornea
* Light sensitivity
* Lesions on eyes
* Glaucoma
* Eye pain
* Eye redness

Eye symptoms provide the common name associated with onchocerciasis, river blindness, and may involve any part of the eye from conjunctiva and cornea to uvea and posterior segment, including the retina and optic nerve. The microfilariae migrate to the surface of the cornea. Punctate keratitis occurs in the infected area. This clears up as the inflammation subsides. However, if the infection is chronic, sclerosing keratitis can occur, making the affected area become opaque. Over time, the entire cornea may become opaque, thus leading to blindness. Some evidence suggests an immune response to bacteria present in the worms causes the effect on the cornea.

=== Mazzotti reaction ===
The Mazzotti reaction, first described in 1948, is a symptom complex seen in patients after undergoing treatment of onchocerciasis with the medication diethylcarbamazine (DEC). Mazzotti reactions can be life-threatening, and are characterized by fever, urticaria, swollen and tender lymph nodes, tachycardia, hypotension, arthralgias, oedema, and abdominal pain that occur within seven days of treatment of microfilariasis.

The phenomenon is so common when DEC is used that this drug is the basis of a skin patch test used to confirm that diagnosis. The drug patch is placed on the skin, and if the patient is infected with &quot;O. volvulus&quot; microfilaria, localized pruritus and urticaria are seen at the application site.

===Nodding disease===
This is an unusual form of epidemic epilepsy associated with onchocerciasis although a definitive link has not been established. This syndrome was first described in Tanzania by Louise Jilek-Aall, a Norwegian psychiatric doctor in Tanzanian practice, during the 1960s. It occurs most commonly in Uganda and South Sudan. It manifests itself in previously healthy 5–15-year-old children, is often triggered by eating or low temperatures, and is accompanied by cognitive impairment. Seizures occur frequently and may be difficult to control. The electroencephalogram is abnormal but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are normal or show non-specific changes. If there are abnormalities on the MRI, they are usually present in the hippocampus.

==Diagnosis==

When a clinical diagnosis of onchocerciasis is obtained, doctors take small snips of skin containing 3–5 mg of skin tissue. The skin samples taken are only from the upper dermis. These samples will then be soaked in saline and examined underneath a microscope to check for the presence of microfilaria. If microfilariae are not detected in the samples, the Mazzotti test is used. In this test, 6 mg of diethylcarbamazine is administered to the affected area. If the patient experiences intense inflammation or itching in the affected area Microfilaria is present. Slit-lamp eye exams are used to identify signs of the parasites in and around the eyes of patients whose eyes are affected. Antibody tests when available can aid in the diagnosis of Onchocerciasis.

===Classification===
Onchocerciasis causes different kinds of skin changes, which vary in different geographic regions; it may be divided into the following phases or types:

;&quot;Erisipela de la costa&quot;
:An acute phase, it is characterized by swelling of the face, with erythema and itching. This skin change, &quot;erisípela de la costa&quot;, of acute onchocerciasis is most commonly seen among victims in Central and South America.
;&quot;Mal morando&quot;
:This cutaneous condition is characterized by inflammation accompanied by hyperpigmentation.
;&quot;Sowda&quot;
:A cutaneous condition, it is a localized type of onchocerciasis.

Additionally, the various skin changes associated with onchocerciasis may be described as follows:

;Leopard skin
:The spotted depigmentation of the skin that may occur with onchocerciasis
;Elephant skin
:The thickening of human skin that may be associated with onchocerciasis
;Lizard skin
:The thickened, wrinkled skin changes that may result with onchocerciasis

==Prevention==
Various control programs aim to stop onchocerciasis from being a public health problem. The Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) launched in 1974, and at its peak, covered 30 million people in the following countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Mali, and Niger. The OCP utilized the following initiatives: the use of larvicide spraying into fast-flowing rivers to control black fly populations, and from 1988 onwards, the use of ivermectin to treat infected people as a core treatment therapy. Alongside the OCP, a joint effort of the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, was considered to be a success in controlling onchocerciasis, and in 2002 shifted from control of onchocerciasis to elimination. According to the World Health Organization, five countries have eradicated onchocerciasis: Colombia (2013), Ecuador (2014), Mexico (2015), Guatemala (2016), and Niger (2025). Continued monitoring ensures onchocerciasis cannot reinvade the area through the OCP. Other effective prevention efforts include personal protection from black fly bites. Recommended protection measures from the CDC include using insect repellents and wearing long sleeves and pants to eliminate exposed skin. Using insect repellent that contains N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) as well as clothing treated with permethrin.

=== Elimination ===
In 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) was initiated to eliminate onchocerciasis in African countries where the disease was endemic. The initiative relied primarily on the use of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin. The initiative was to set up community-directed treatment with ivermectin for those at risk of infection. Overall transmission has declined. The APOC ended in 2015 and aspects of its work has been taken over by the WHO Expanded Special Programme for the Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN). As in the Americas, the objective of ESPEN has been to work with Government Health Ministries and partner non-governmental organizations, to eliminate the transmission of onchocerciasis. This requires consistent annual treatment of 80% of the population in endemic areas for at least 10–12 years, the life span of the adult worm. In 2025, Niger was announced by the World Health Organization to be the first African country to eradicate onchocerciasis. Treatment has stopped in some areas (e.g. Nigeria), following epidemiological and entomological assessments that demonstrated no ongoing transmission could be detected.

The Onchocerciasis Elimination Programme for the Americas (OEPA) was launched in 1992. On July 29, 2013, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) announced that after 16 years of efforts, Colombia had become the first country in the world to eliminate onchocerciasis. Countries that received verification of elimination were Colombia in 2013, Ecuador in 2015, and Guatemala in 2016. The key factor in elimination was mass administration of ivermectin. The OEPA projection was that the disease would be eliminated from all remaining countries in the Americas by 2012. In September 2015, the OEPA announced that onchocerciasis only remained in a remote region on the border of Brazil and Venezuela. The area is home to the Yanomami indigenous people.

No vaccine to prevent onchocerciasis infection in humans is available. This is due to two potential target product profiles (TPPs) that must be considered when developing a vaccine for onchocerciasis, making vaccine development difficult. The project to develop a vaccine for the disease has two goals. The first priority is a preventive vaccine for children five years or younger, as this population does not receive ivermectin. The second is a therapeutic vaccine to target adult worms, microfilariae, and the causative agents of pathology and transmission, or both, for children and adults with &quot;O. volvulus&quot; infection.

==Treatment==

In mass drug administration (MDA) programmes, the treatment for onchocerciasis is ivermectin (trade name: Mectizan). Ivermectin is administered four times a year and will be continually administered for 10–14 years due to the lifespan of the adult worm. Intense skin itching is eventually relieved, and the progression towards blindness is halted. The drug reduces larval release from the adult worm but does not kill it. However the drug does not prevent transmission of Onchocerciasis. It however reduces morbidity and has shown promising results to eliminate in some endemic areas of Africa

Ivermectin treatment is particularly effective because it only needs to be taken once or twice a year, needs no refrigeration, and has a wide margin of safety, with the result that it has been widely given by minimally trained community health workers. Patients taking the drug for the treatment of onchocerciasis may have adverse effects within 1–2 days after the drug is administered. Symptoms include urticaria, pruritus, fever, dermatitis, myalgia, swelling of the face and limbs, or postural hypotension.

===Antibiotics===
For the treatment of individuals, doxycycline is used to kill the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria that live in adult worms. This adjunct therapy has been shown to significantly lower microfilarial loads in the host and may kill the adult worms, due to the symbiotic relationship between &quot;Wolbachia&quot; and the worm. In four separate trials over ten years with various dosing regimens of doxycycline for individualized treatment, doxycycline was found to be effective in sterilizing the female worms and reducing their numbers over four to six weeks. Research on other antibiotics, such as rifampicin, has shown it to be effective in animal models at reducing &quot;Wolbachia&quot; both as an alternative and as an adjunct to doxycycline. However, doxycycline treatment requires daily dosing for at least four to six weeks, making it more difficult to administer in the affected areas.

===Ivermectin===
Ivermectin kills the parasite by interfering with the nervous system and muscle function, in particular, by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. The drug binds to and activates glutamate-gated chloride channels. These channels, present in neurons and myocytes, are not invertebrate-specific, but are protected in vertebrates from the action of ivermectin by the blood–brain barrier. Ivermectin is thought to irreversibly activate these channel receptors in the worm, eventually causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The chance of a future action potential occurring in synapses between neurons decreases and the nematodes experience flaccid paralysis followed by death.

Ivermectin is directly effective against the larval stage microfilariae of &quot;O. volvulus&quot;; they are paralyzed and can be killed by eosinophils and macrophages. It does not kill adult females (macrofilariae) but does cause them to cease releasing microfilariae, perhaps by paralyzing the reproductive tract. Ivermectin is very effective in reducing microfilarial load and reducing number of punctate opacities in individuals with onchocerciasis.

===Moxidectin===
After two decades of research, moxidectin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for use in ages 12 and older. Ongoing studies are looking to identify doses that will be safe for children ages 4–11. The oral dosage for moxidectin in adults and children 12 and up is 8 mg in a single dose. Moxidectin has been found to more strongly suppress the &quot;O.&quot; &quot;volvulus&quot; microfilariae for longer than ivermectin treatments, with peak clearance of microfilariae in the skin at one month after treatment. After six months post-treatment, many individuals treated with moxidectin have no detectable microfilariae in their skin.

==Epidemiology==

About 21 million people were infected with this parasite in 2017; about 1.2 million of those had vision loss. As of 2017, about 99% of onchocerciasis cases occurred in Africa. Onchocerciasis is currently relatively common in 31 African countries, Yemen, and isolated regions of South America. Over 85 million people live in endemic areas, and half of these reside in Nigeria. Another 120 million people are at risk for contracting the disease. The &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot; main habitat is fast-flowing rivers, Onchocerciasis is more commonly found along the large rivers in northern and central regions of Africa, with cases decreasing with distance from the rivers. Multiple exposures to &quot;Simulium&quot; blackflies raise the number of adult worms and microfilariae that are present in the host. Risk of contracting Onchocerciasis for casual travelers is low, since it often takes several exposures, while travelers that stay for longer visits such as missionaries or long-term volunteers have a greater risk of contracting Onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis was eliminated in the northern focus in Chiapas, Mexico, and the focus in Oaxaca, Mexico, where &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot; existed, was determined, after several years of treatment with ivermectin, as free of the transmission of the parasite. In April 2013, Colombia became the first country to achieve elimination of Onchocerciasis, verified by the World Health Organization. In the following three years, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico eliminated Onchocerciasis with ivermectin.

Cities in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Uganda, and the Congo have had the largest amounts of infected individuals.

The efforts of CDTI (Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin) were conducted to study Onchocerciasis associations with epilepsy. The results do not go unnoticed as they decreased the number of microfilariae (larvae) loads. This was able to decrease the number of blind people due to onchocerciasis dramatically. However, another issue that arises is the fact that onchocerciasis can cause epilepsy, most likely because the level of microfilariae load required to develop epilepsy is much lower than to develop blindness.

According to a 2002 WHO report, onchocerciasis has not caused a single death, but its global burden is 987,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The severe itchiness alone accounts for 60% of the DALYs. Infection reduces the host&#x27;s immunity and resistance to other diseases, which results in an estimated reduction in life expectancy of 13 years. In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease study said that an estimated 220 million people needed preventive chemotherapy for onchocerciasis. Of those infected, 14.6 million had skin disease, and 1.15 million experienced vision loss.

Onchocerciasis is the second leading cause of blindness from infectious causes. Main disease symptoms, such as blindness and itching, contribute to disease burden by limiting the infected individuals&#x27; ability to live and work. Individuals most at risk live or work in areas where &quot;Simulium&quot; blackflies are most common, mostly near rivers and streams. Rural agricultural areas in sub-Saharan Africa see the most disease burden by blackfly bites. Onchocerciasis common to tropical environments, like that of sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 99% percent of infected individuals occupy the 31 countries. Onchocerciasis can be linked to impoverished remote areas, as residents who experience symptoms can no longer tend to land or navigate the area. Areas with high infection rates may experience up to one-third of residents affected by onchocerciasis symptoms. The age group most impacted by the disease are individuals age 61+ years.

==History==
Onchocerca originated in Africa and was exported to the Americas by the slave trade, as part of the Columbian exchange that introduced other old-world diseases such as yellow fever into the New World. The findings of a phylogenetic study in the mid-90s are consistent with an introduction to the New World in this manner. DNA sequences of savannah and rainforest strains in Africa differ, while American strains are identical to savannah strains in western Africa. The microfilarial parasite that causes the disease was first identified in 1874 by an Irish naval surgeon, John O&#x27;Neill, who sought to identify the cause of a common skin disease along the west coast of Africa, known as &quot;craw-craw&quot;. Rudolf Leuckart, a German zoologist, later examined specimens of the same filarial worm sent from Africa by a German missionary doctor in 1890 and named the organism &quot;Filaria volvulus&quot;.

Rodolfo Robles and Rafael Pacheco in Guatemala first mentioned the ocular form of the disease in the Americas in about 1915. They described a tropical worm infection with adult &quot;Onchocerca&quot; that included inflammation of the skin, especially the face (&#x27;erisipela de la costa&#x27;), and eyes. The disease, commonly called the &quot;filarial blinding disease&quot;, and later referred to as &quot;Robles disease&quot;, was common among coffee plantation workers. Manifestations included subcutaneous nodules, anterior eye lesions, and dermatitis. Robles sent specimens to Émile Brumpt, a French parasitologist, who named it &quot;O. caecutiens&quot; in 1919, indicating the parasite caused blindness (Latin &quot;caecus&quot; meaning blind). The disease was also reported as being common in Mexico. By the early 1920s, it was generally agreed that the filaria in Africa and Central America were morphologically indistinguishable and the same as that described by O&#x27;Neill 50 years earlier.

Robles hypothesized that the vector of the disease was the day-biting black fly, &quot;Simulium&quot;. Scottish physician Donald Blacklock of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine confirmed this mode of transmission in studies in Sierra Leone. Blacklock&#x27;s experiments included the re-infection of &quot;Simulium&quot; flies exposed to portions of the skin of infected subjects on which nodules were present, which led to the elucidation of the life cycle of the Onchocerca parasite. Blacklock and others could find no evidence of eye disease in Africa. Jean Hissette, a Belgian ophthalmologist, discovered in 1930 that the organism was the cause of a &quot;river blindness&quot; in the Belgian Congo. Some of the patients reported seeing tangled threads or worms in their vision, which were microfilariae moving freely in the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber of the eye. Blacklock and Strong had thought the African worm did not affect the eyes, but Hissette reported that 50% of patients with onchocerciasis near the Sankuru River in the Belgian Congo had eye disease and 20% were blind. Hisette Isolated the microfilariae from an enucleated eye and described the typical chorioretinal scarring, later called the &quot;Hissette-Ridley fundus&quot; after another ophthalmologist, Harold Ridley, who also made extensive observations on onchocerciasis patients in northwest Ghana, publishing his findings in 1945. Ridley first postulated that the disease was brought by the slave trade. The international scientific community was initially skeptical of Hisette&#x27;s findings, but they were confirmed by the Harvard African Expedition of 1934, led by Richard P. Strong, an American tropical medicine physician.

==Society and culture==
Since 1987, ivermectin has been provided free of charge for use in humans by Merck through the Mectizan donation program (MDP). The MDP works together with ministries of health and nongovernmental development organisations, such as the World Health Organization, to provide free ivermectin to those who need it in endemic areas. Due to the joint efforts of NGOs and WHO, onchocerciasis is no longer an obstacle in socio-economic development.

In 2015 William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura were co-awarded half of that year&#x27;s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the avermectin family of compounds, the forerunner of ivermectin. The latter has come to decrease the occurrence of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.

Uganda&#x27;s government, working with the Carter Center river blindness program since 1996, switched strategies for the distribution of Mectizan. The male-dominated volunteer distribution system had failed to take advantage of traditional kinship structures and roles. In 2014, the program switched from village health teams to community distributors, primarily selecting women to assure that everyone in the circle of their family and friends received river blindness information and Mectizan.

In 2021, Nigeria had the greatest prevalence of onchocerciasis infections globally and attributed the infection to 30.2% of blindness cases in the country. A study from western Nigeria found that residents believed that the parasitic effects of the disease were necessary to stimulate fertility and that the disease was thought to be carried by all residents.

== Research ==
Animal models for the disease are somewhat limited, as the parasite only lives in primates, but there are close parallels. &quot;Litomosoides sigmodontis &quot;, which will naturally infect cotton rats, has been found to fully develop in BALB/c mice. &quot;Onchocerca ochengi&quot;, the closest relative of &quot;O. volvulus&quot;, lives in intradermal cavities in cattle, and is also spread by black flies. Both systems are useful, but not exact, animal models.

A study of 2501 people in Ghana showed the prevalence rate doubled between 2000 and 2005 despite treatment, suggesting the parasite is developing resistance to the drug. A clinical trial of another anti-parasitic agent, moxidectin (manufactured by Wyeth), began on July 1, 2009 (NCT00790998).

A Cochrane review compared outcomes of people treated with ivermectin alone versus doxycycline plus ivermectin. While there were no differences in most vision-related outcomes between the two treatments, there was low-quality evidence suggesting treatment with doxycycline plus ivermectin showed improvement in iridocyclitis and punctate keratitis, over those treated with ivermectin alone.

In 2017, WHO set up the Onchocerciasis Technical Advisory Subgroup (OTS) to further research and establish areas that require drug administration. The OTS also identifies co-endemic areas with lymphatic filariasis to properly treat Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis.

WHO prioritizes research to eliminate onchocerciasis. Research approaches include: improving outreach efforts to marginalized populations, expanding the mapping of endemic areas of onchocerciasis, improving and standardizing information on mass drug administration, develop diagnostic approaches, surveillance strategies, and therapeutic approaches.

<text>Exmouth ( ) is a town on the tip of the North West Cape and on Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia, north of the state capital Perth and southwest of Darwin.

The town was established in 1967 to support the nearby United States Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt. It is named after Exmouth Gulf. Beginning in the late 1970s, the town began hosting United States Air Force personnel assigned to Learmonth Solar Observatory, a defence science facility jointly operated with Australia&#x27;s Ionospheric Prediction Service. The town is served by Learmonth Airport.

==History==
In 1618, Dutch East India Company ship , under command of Willem Janszoon, landed near North West Cape, just proximate to what would be Exmouth, and named Willem&#x27;s River, which was later renamed Ashburton River.

The location was first used as a military base in World War II. US Admiral James F. Calvert in his memoir, &quot;Silent Running: My Years on a World War II Attack Submarine&quot;, and US Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood in &quot;Sink &#x27;Em All&quot;, his narrative of Allied submarine warfare, describe its history. After the retreat from Java in March 1942, Allied naval forces required a forward base for replenishing submarines, then the sole form of offensive warfare against the Japanese. Both Darwin, Northern Territory, and Broome, Western Australia, were too exposed to air attack, so a unmotorized lighter was placed as a refueling barge near the mouth of Exmouth Gulf, where the Allies were already maintaining a seaplane tender.

Code-named &quot;Potshot&quot;, the spartan base was also developed as a submarine advanced base and rest camp using the tender USS &quot;Pelias&quot;. An airfield (now RAAF Learmonth) was constructed to provide fighter defense for the base. Z Special Unit used Potshot as a staging base for Operation Jaywick, a raid on Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour, in September 1943. m

In 2009, an emergency landing of the flight Qantas 72 was made at the nearby Learmonth Airport / RAAF Base Learmonth. The A330 had an incident involving the ADIRU which confused AoA (Angle of Attack) data with altitude data, making the plane think it was in a 16° pitch up when it was flying level. So the protection measures on the plane forced a 16° pitch down twice and brought negative G-forces on all passengers and it made them float for about 15 seconds. There were no deaths, but 1 crew member and 11 passengers suffered serious injuries.

==Tourism==

The town relies more on tourism than the station for its existence. At the 2016 census, Exmouth had a population of 2,486. At the height of the tourist season, the population swells to 6,000.

Exmouth is popular for diving and snorkelling. Some of the most famous snorkeling spots include Turquoise Bay and Oysters Stacks.

The Cape Range National Park, which has several gorges, is an area of and its main area is focused on the west coast of the Cape, which provides a large variety of camp sites on the coastal fringe of the park. Yardie Creek and Charles Knife Gorge are land based attractions.

On 20 April 2023, Exmouth was in the direct path of a total solar eclipse, which was the first to be visible in Australia since November 2012. More than 20,000 people watched the eclipse from Exmouth. This cost the State Government of Western Australia in planning and logistics fees.

=== Big Things ===
Exmouth is also home to two of Australia&#x27;s Big Things: The Big Whale Shark (constructed 2002) and The Big Prawn (constructed 2005) both of which were constructed by Brian Paskins.

There is an ongoing &quot;Prawn War&quot; between this Big Prawn and the Big Prawn in Ballina, New South Wales; the Big Prawn in Ballina is larger but Exmouth locals say theirs is much more realistic.

==Climate==
Exmouth has a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). Temperatures often reach over in summer; however, winters are warm with daytime temperatures around . There is no specific wet and dry season in Exmouth, although rain is most likely to fall between January and July, usually with monsoonal showers and storms from January to April and from the northern edges of cold fronts in May, June and July. The area occasionally gets caught by tropical cyclones. The period from August to December is usually dry. 
===Weather events===
On 22 March 1999, Tropical Cyclone Vance reached category 5 status as it made landfall near Exmouth. This resulted in the highest wind gust ever reported on the Australian mainland, at Learmonth, to the south. Vance caused significant flooding and property damage. There were no casualties.

In April 2014, Exmouth was hit by a massive flash flood, nearly destroying the caravan park and seriously damaging much of the town&#x27;s infrastructure, causing a severe blow to tourism in the region.

<doc id="276852" wikidata="Q372001" url="?curid=276852" title="Windward and leeward">
<text>In geography and seamanship, windward () and leeward () are directions relative to the wind. Windward is &quot;upwind&quot; from the point of reference, i.e., towards the direction from which the wind is coming; leeward is &quot;downwind&quot; from the point of reference, i.e., along the direction towards which the wind is going.

The side of a ship that is towards the leeward is its &quot;lee side&quot;. If the vessel is heeling under the pressure of crosswind, the lee side will be the &quot;lower side&quot;. During the Age of Sail, the term &quot;weather&quot; was used as a synonym for &quot;windward&quot; in some contexts, as in the &quot;weather gage&quot;.

Since it captures rainfall, the windward side of a mountain tends to be wetter than the leeward side it blocks. The drier leeward area is said to be in a rain shadow.

== Origin ==
The term &quot;windward&quot; has roots in both Low German and Old English. The word &quot;lee&quot;, which means a place without wind, comes from the Old Norse &quot;hle&quot; for &quot;cover&quot; and has been used in marine navigation in Germany since medieval times. The word &quot;wind,&quot; meaning &quot;air in motion,&quot; comes from Proto-Germanic *winda- and has evolved over time, with pronunciation changes influenced by similar words like &quot;windy.&quot; The word &quot;wind&quot; has been associated with emptiness and vanity since the late 13th century. Additionally, &quot;wind&quot; has been used figuratively in phrases like &quot;which way the wind blows&quot; to indicate the current state of affairs. The suffix &quot;-ward,&quot; meaning &quot;toward,&quot; is an adverbial suffix in Old English derived from Proto-Germanic *werda-, which itself comes from the PIE root *wer- meaning &quot;to turn, bend.&quot; The original notion of &quot;-ward&quot; is &quot;turned toward.&quot;

==Usage==
Windward and leeward directions (and the points of sail they create) are important factors to consider in such wind-powered or wind-impacted activities as sailing, wind-surfing, gliding, hang-gliding, and parachuting. Other terms with broadly the same meaning are widely used, particularly &quot;upwind&quot; and &quot;downwind&quot;.

===Nautical===
Among sailing craft, the windward vessel is normally the more maneuverable. For this reason, rule 12 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, applying to sailing vessels, stipulates that where two are sailing in similar directions in relation to the wind, the windward vessel gives way to the leeward vessel. 

===Naval warfare===
In naval warfare during the Age of Sail, a vessel always sought to use the wind to its advantage, maneuvering if possible to attack from windward. This was particularly important for less maneuverable square-rigged warships, which had limited ability to sail upwind, and sought to &quot;hold the weather gage&quot; entering battle.

This was particularly important once artillery was introduced to naval warfare. Ships heel away from the wind, so the leeward vessel would expose more of her topsides to shot, in extreme cases even part of her bottom.

===Describing islands===
The terms windward and leeward are used in reference both to sides (and climates) of individual islands and relative island locations in an archipelago. The windward side of an island is subject to the prevailing wind, and is thus the wetter (see orographic precipitation). The leeward side is the side distant from or physically in the lee of the prevailing wind, and typically the drier. 

In an archipelago &quot;windward islands&quot; are upwind and &quot;leeward islands&quot; are downwind of the prevailing winds, such as the trade winds of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

<text>Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., or simply Couche-Tard, is a Canadian multinational operator of convenience stores. The company has approximately 16,700 stores across Canada, the United States, Mexico, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong, and Indonesia. The company operates its corporate stores mainly under the Couche-Tard, Circle K, and On the Run brands but also under the affiliated brands
Mac&#x27;s Convenience Stores, go! (Go Store), Provi-Soir, 7-jours, Dairy/Daisy Mart, Becker&#x27;s and Winks. 

Founded by current chairman Alain Bouchard, the corporation is based in Laval, Quebec, Canada, a suburb of Montreal. The flagship Couche-Tard and Mac&#x27;s stores, as well as some older Winks outlets, prominently feature a distinctive anthropomorphic red, winking owl. This mascot was inherited from the Provi-Soir / Winks chain when it was absorbed in the late 1990s.

In French, &quot;couche-tard&quot; means &quot;(the type of person who) goes to bed late&quot;, with connotations very similar to &quot;night owl&quot; in English.

== History ==
Alain Bouchard opened his first convenience store in 1980 in Laval. In 1985, Bouchard acquired 11 &quot;Couche-Tard&quot; branded stores in the Quebec City area which he merged with its existing stores in the Montreal area to rename the whole company &quot;Alimentation Couche-Tard&quot;. In 1987, the company purchased the 7 Jours chain from Metro-Richelieu, which Couche-Tard has kept a separate chain to this day.

In 1992, the chain gradually converted to the new discount banner &quot;Dépan-Escompte&quot;, beginning with 34 stores mostly located in the Quebec City area. In 1993, the company purchased 54 Mac&#x27;s and La Maisonnée convenience stores from the troubled Silcorp Ltd. of Toronto. In 1994, Couche-Tard completed the conversion of its 182 stores to the Dépan-Escompte banner which included the Mac&#x27;s/La Maisonnée locations but not the 7 Jours chain. In the summer of 1994, Couche-Tard made a deal to acquire the 86 convenience stores from the Perette chain which had filed for bankruptcy protection in June 1994. During the Dépan-Escompte era, a piggy bank mascot was adopted and replaced the previous Couche-Tard sleepwalker mascot from the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

In May 1997, Couche-Tard acquired C Corp, a subsidiary of Provigo that owned the chains Provi-Soir in Quebec, Winks in Ontario and Red Rooster in Alberta. Couche-Tard, which was already dominating its industry, grew to 610 outlets in Canada following the transaction. In early 1999, Dépan-Escompte Couche-Tard and Provi-Soir merged into a single branding; reverting to the Couche-Tard name without &quot;Dépan-Escompte&quot; (albeit with a new logotype), but adopting the owl mascot of Provi-Soir. The company has since revived the Provi-Soir name in Quebec which it keeps as a distinct chain, much like the 7 Jours division. The new Provi-Soir, basically a combination of rebranded Couche-Tard and 7 Jours locations, does not feature the owl mascot from the original chain and its logotype is completely different than in its last incarnation.

Similarly, Silcorp had consolidated several of the largest Ontario convenience-store chains, such as Mac&#x27;s and Becker&#x27;s, under its ownership before being itself acquired by Couche-Tard. As in Quebec, other corporate banners such as Becker&#x27;s and Mike&#x27;s Mart are slowly being phased out in favour of the dominant Mac&#x27;s brand, although new franchised stores are still being opened under the Winks and Daisy Mart brands.

In 2001, Couche-Tard broke into the American market with the acquisition of 172 Bigfoot convenience stores from Johnson Oil Company of Columbus, Indiana.

After making some tentative moves in the U.S. under the Mac&#x27;s brand in the early 2000s, Couche-Tard acquired the Circle K chain from ConocoPhillips in 2003, promptly rebranding its existing U.S. locations to the better-known Circle K moniker. The Circle K brand is also franchised in Asia and elsewhere.

Couche-Tard obtained the master franchise for Dunkin&#x27; Donuts in Quebec in August 2003, but agreed in August 2008 to terminate this franchise within 12 to 18 months.

In early 2010, Couche-Tard started consolidating its outlets in Quebec by closing down many of those that did not do well in sales, and therefore allowing the successful ones to prosper. In all, over 300 stores were closed from 2010 through 2012.

In 2014, Couche-Tard sold off its Tiendas Extra chain, a subsidiary of Circle K, in Mexico to Grupo Modelo.

In 2015, Manulife Bank of Canada reached a deal with Couche-Tard to add its ATMs to 830 locations.

On September 23, 2015, Couche-Tard announced that it would relaunch the Circle K brand, and extend it to all of its stores in English Canada, the United States, and Scandinavia. The rebranding did not include its stores in Quebec, which remained under the Couche-Tard brand; Couche-Tard would later undergo a rebranding in 2021 to align it with Circle K&#x27;s brand identity, switching to its red and yellow corporate colors and an encircled logo.

On August 29, 2016, the purchase of 53 Cracker Barrel convenience stores in Louisiana for an undisclosed price was announced. As in the case with most of its other acquisitions, the Cracker Barrel chain would also be converted to Circle K stores. The acquired chain stores all have gas stations, with the exception of one location, and 12 have quick-serve restaurants. The Cracker Barrel chain is unrelated to the restaurant chain of the same name.

In July 2017, Couche-Tard announced an agreement to acquire Holiday Stationstores, the 18th largest convenience store chain in the United States, with over 500 locations in 10 states.

In August 2020, Couche-Tard was out-bid by 7-Eleven&#x27;s US$21 billion acquisition of 3900 Speedway locations from Marathon Petroleum.

In July 2021, Couche-Tard announced a deal to purchase the 226 retail gasoline/convenience stores and marine fuel terminal of Truro, Nova Scotia-based Wilson Fuel for an undisclosed amount, pending approval by the Competition Bureau. The acquisition was completed on March 1, 2023. To alleviate competition concerns, Couche-Tard sold 52 locations to Harnois Énergies.

Operations in Russia (38 stores) were suspended in 2022. 

In December 2022, Couche-Tard announced an agreement to acquire U.S. express car wash operator True Blue Car Wash (which operates under the Clean Freak and Rainstorm banners in the southwestern and midwestern United States respectively).

In March 2023, Couche-Tard announced the acquisition of 1,600 TotalEnergies service stations in Germany and the Netherlands, for an undisclosed sum. At the same time in Belgium and Luxembourg, Couche-Tard and TotalEnergies announced the creation of a joint venture to take over TotalEnergies&#x27; 619 service stations. The following month, the company signed an agreement to buy 112 service stations and convenience stores from MAPCO Express in the United States.

On August 19, 2024, Couche-Tard announced that they had acquired all 270 GetGo stores from Giant Eagle for an undisclosed sum. It was also announced that GetGo stores would continue to offer Giant Eagle&#x27;s MyPerks rewards program after the sale concludes. On the same day, Couche-Tard also offered to buy the Japanese company Seven &amp; I Holdings, operator of the international chain of 7-Eleven convenience stores and later that year sent a revised offer after initial bid was rejected.

==Recent and current operations==
In Canada, there are 581 corporate stores in Quebec under the names Couche-Tard, Provi-Soir and Dépanneur 7 jours as well as 298 affiliated stores. In Ontario, there are 702 corporate stores and 214 affiliated stores, and in Western Canada, 305 corporate stores and 71 affiliates operated under the names Mac&#x27;s, Mike&#x27;s Mart, Becker&#x27;s (operated independently), Daisy Mart, and Winks. Locations outside of Quebec have been rebranded as Circle K stores (excluding Becker&#x27;s).

The brands operated by Couche-Tard are:

* Circle K: the group&#x27;s primary brand, used internationally.
* Holiday Stationstores: American brand, referred to as the Northern Tier region.
* Couche-Tard: Quebec brand
* Ingo: European brand
* On the Run: international (retired brand)
* Becker&#x27;s: Ontario (retired brand)
* Mac&#x27;s: Canada (retired brand)
* Kangaroo Express (retired brand)
* Topaz: Ireland (retired brand)

===Irving Oil stores===
Many Couche-Tard locations are gas stations co-branded with Irving Oil. The first stage of this partnership began in 2001 in Quebec. Both companies contributed locations to the partnership: some had convenience stores that previously operated under Irving&#x27;s &quot;Marché Mainway&quot; banner, while others previously sold fuel under the Couche-Tard brand. All these locations now have Couche-Tard convenience stores and Irving-branded fuel.

The partnership expanded in 2008, as Irving leased its remaining Bluecanoe and Mainway convenience stores to Couche-Tard, expanding the latter chain&#x27;s reach into Atlantic Canada and New England under the Circle K brand. Irving continues to own the buildings and property, and supplies Irving-branded fuel to these stations.

===On the Run stores===
In the United States, approximately 470 On the Run stores are owned or franchised by Alimentation Couche-Tard under an agreement with ExxonMobil announced April 29, 2009. This also includes 43 ExxonMobil stations in the Phoenix, Arizona market, all of which have been rebranded to Circle K. While many On the Run stations in the United States still sell Exxon or Mobil gasoline, some franchised locations sell other brands not associated with ExxonMobil.

=== Circle K ===

Circle K is an international chain of convenience stores owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard. The brand is the flagship international brand of the company, and has largely replaced other brands previously used or acquired by the company.

=== Couche-Tard ===
Couche-Tard is the original brand of Alimentation Couche-Tard. The brand is present only in Québec along with Provi-Soir and Dépanneur 7 jours. 

===Casey&#x27;s General Stores===
In March 2010, Couche-Tard offered $1.9 billion for control of the Iowa-based Casey&#x27;s General Stores chain, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey&#x27;s rejected Couche-Tard&#x27;s offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard&#x27;s nominated slate.

===Statoil===
On April 18, 2012, it became known that Couche-Tard had agreed to buy Norway&#x27;s Statoil Fuel and Retail (previously owned by Statoil) for $2.8 billion, giving Couche-Tard the largest chain of petrol stations in Scandinavia and with a presence around the Baltic region, Poland, and Russia. On June 20, 2012, Statoil Fuel and Retail&#x27;s shareholders voted in favor (+91.56%) of the acquisition and later it was declared that Couche-Tard had finally acquired 100% of Statoil Fuel and Retail for approximately 2.8 billion $US (forcing the minority shareholders to sell their shares). This acquisition added over 2,853 stores to Couche-Tard&#x27;s portfolio and a mega-presence in Europe. Alain Bouchard planned to grow this newly acquired chain all over Europe. In 2016, all Statoil stations were rebranded to Circle K.

=== Imperial Oil retail ===
On March 8, 2016, Couche-Tard announced it had agreed to purchase Imperial Oil&#x27;s Esso retail locations in Ontario (228 locations) and Quebec (50 locations) for $2.8 billion. The stations&#x27; convenience stores would be re-branded as Circle K in Ontario, and all would remain supplied by Esso.

=== CST Brands ===
On August 22, 2016, Couche-Tard agreed to buy American company CST Brands and its 2,000 stores, mostly in Texas and other southern states, for $3.78 billion, $4.4 billion including debt. This deal, which was the largest purchase in their history, officially closed on June 28, 2017. Couche-Tard has announced that it will sell around 45% of the new stores to another company to pass competition laws. CST Holdings was based in San Antonio and employed over 14,000 people at the 2,000 stores Couche-Tard took over. The stores acquired were mostly in the southwestern and southeastern United States, with a small presence in New York and Eastern Canada, operating under the Corner Stores, Flash Foods, and Nice N Easy Grocery Shoppes brands. Most locations were rebranded to the Circle K brand after the acquisition.

Due to competition concerns, most of CST&#x27;s Ultramar operations in Canada were not included in the deal, which were sold off separately to Parkland Fuel Corporation.

=== COPEC ===
In November 2023, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., finalized the acquisition of 112 MAPCO Express Inc. fuel and convenience retail sites from Compañía de Petróleos de Chile S.A. (COPEC), as part of COPEC&#x27;s divestiture of its MAPCO assets. The stores, located across Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky, and Georgia, will undergo rebranding to the Circle K identity. This transaction, which also includes surplus property and a logistics fleet, complements Couche-Tard&#x27;s significant global presence, which encompasses over 14,000 stores in 24 countries and territories and employs approximately 122,000 people. Concurrently, Majors Management LLC acquired 192 MAPCO-branded stores and additional MAPCO assets, aiming to enhance service and expand both companies&#x27; market reach in the southeastern U.S.

=== Other transactions ===
In January 2021, Couche-Tard and Carrefour SA announced that they are looking at operational partnerships after takeover talks were abandoned.

<doc id="276857" wikidata="Q1861183" url="?curid=276857" title="Tychonic system">
<text>The Tychonic system (or Tychonian system) is a model of the universe published by Tycho Brahe in 1588, which combines what he saw as the mathematical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical and &quot;physical&quot; benefits of the Ptolemaic system. The model may have been inspired by Valentin Naboth and Paul Wittich, a Silesian mathematician and astronomer. A similar cosmological model was independently proposed in the Hindu astronomical treatise &quot;Tantrasamgraha&quot; () by Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.

It is conceptually a geocentric model, or more precisely geoheliocentric: the Earth is at the centre of the universe, the Sun and Moon and the stars revolve around the Earth, and the other five planets revolve around the Sun. At the same time, the motions of the planets are mathematically equivalent to the motions in Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric system under a simple coordinate transformation, so that, as long as no force law is postulated to explain &quot;why&quot; the planets move as described, there is no mathematical reason to prefer either the Tychonic or the Copernican system.

== Motivation for the Tychonic system ==
Tycho admired aspects of Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric model, but felt that it had problems as concerned physics, astronomical observations of stars, and religion. Regarding the Copernican system, Tycho wrote,

This innovation expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.
(The &quot;triple motion&quot; refers to its daily rotation, yearly revolution, and axial precession.) 

In regard to physics, Tycho held that the Earth was just too sluggish and heavy to be continuously in motion. According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens (whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending) were made of &quot;Aether&quot; or &quot;Quintessence&quot;; this substance, not found on Earth, was light, strong, and unchanging, and its natural state was circular motion. By contrast, the Earth (where objects seem to have motion only when moved) and things on it were composed of substances that were heavy and whose natural state was rest. Consequently, the Earth was considered to be a &quot;lazy&quot; body that was not readily moved. Thus while Tycho acknowledged that the daily rising and setting of the Sun and stars could be explained by the Earth&#x27;s rotation, as Copernicus had said, still such a fast motion could not belong to the earth, a body very heavy and dense and opaque, but rather belongs to the sky itself whose form and subtle and constant matter are better suited to a perpetual motion, however fast. 

In regards to the stars, Tycho also believed that if the Earth orbited the Sun annually there should be an observable stellar parallax over any period of six months, during which the angular orientation of a given star would change thanks to Earth&#x27;s changing position (this parallax does exist, but is so small it was not detected until 1838, when Friedrich Bessel discovered a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of the star 61 Cygni). The Copernican explanation for this lack of parallax was that the stars were such a great distance from Earth that Earth&#x27;s orbit was almost insignificant by comparison. However, Tycho noted that this explanation introduced another problem: Stars as seen by the naked eye appear small, but of some size, with more prominent stars such as Vega appearing larger than lesser stars such as Polaris, which in turn appear larger than many others. Tycho had determined that a typical star measured approximately a minute of arc in size, with more prominent ones being two or three times as large. In writing to Christoph Rothmann, a Copernican astronomer, Tycho used basic geometry to show that, assuming a small parallax that just escaped detection, the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the Sun to Saturn. Moreover, the only way the stars could be so distant and still appear the sizes they do in the sky would be if even average stars were gigantic—at least as big as the orbit of the Earth, and of course vastly larger than the Sun (most stars visible to the naked eye are giants, supergiants, or large, bright main-sequence stars). And, Tycho said, the more prominent stars would have to be even larger still. And what if the parallax was even smaller than anyone thought, so the stars were yet more distant? Then they would all have to be even larger still. Tycho saidDeduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference. Copernicans offered a religious response to Tycho&#x27;s geometry: titanic, distant stars might seem unreasonable, but they were not, for the Creator could make his creations that large if he wanted. In fact, Rothmann responded to this argument of Tycho&#x27;s by saying [W]hat is so absurd about [an average star] having size equal to the whole [orbit of the Earth]? What of this is contrary to divine will, or is impossible by divine Nature, or is inadmissible by infinite Nature? These things must be entirely demonstrated by you, if you will wish to infer from here anything of the absurd. These things that vulgar sorts see as absurd at first glance are not easily charged with absurdity, for in fact divine Sapience and Majesty is far greater than they understand. Grant the vastness of the Universe and the sizes of the stars to be as great as you like—these will still bear no proportion to the infinite Creator. It reckons that the greater the king, so much greater and larger the palace befitting his majesty. So how great a palace do you reckon is fitting to GOD?

Religion played a role in Tycho&#x27;s geocentrism also—he cited the authority of scripture in portraying the Earth as being at rest. He rarely used Biblical arguments alone (to him they were a secondary objection to the idea of Earth&#x27;s motion) and over time he came to focus on scientific arguments, but he did take Biblical arguments seriously.

Tycho advocated as an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system a &quot;geoheliocentric&quot; system (now known as the Tychonic system), which he developed in the late 1570s. In such a system, the Sun, Moon, and stars circle a central Earth, while the five planets orbit the Sun. The essential difference between the heavens (including the planets) and the Earth remained: Motion stayed in the aethereal heavens; immobility stayed with the heavy sluggish Earth. It was a system that Tycho said violated neither the laws of physics nor sacred scripture—with stars located just beyond Saturn and of reasonable size.

=== Precursors to geoheliocentrism ===
Tycho was not the first to propose a geoheliocentric system. It used to be thought that Heraclides in the 4th century BC had suggested that Mercury and Venus revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth. Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius (395–423 AD) later described this as the &quot;Egyptian System&quot;, stating that &quot;it did not escape the skill of the Egyptians&quot;, though there is no other evidence it was known in ancient Egypt. The difference was that Tycho&#x27;s system had all the planets (with the exception of Earth) revolving around the Sun, instead of just the interior planets of Mercury and Venus. In this regard, he was anticipated in the 15th century by the Kerala school astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji, whose geoheliocentric system also had all the planets revolving around the Sun. The difference to both these systems was that Tycho&#x27;s model of the Earth does not rotate daily, as Heraclides and Nilakantha claimed, but is static. He was also anticipated by the cosmology depicted in the Leiden Aratea, a Carolingian manuscript created in the early 9th Century for the Carolingian court. 

== History and development ==
Tycho&#x27;s system was foreshadowed, in part, by that of Martianus Capella, who described a system in which Mercury and Venus are placed on epicycles around the Sun, which circles the Earth. Copernicus, who cited Capella&#x27;s theory, even mentioned the possibility of an extension in which the other three of the six known planets would also circle the Sun. This was foreshadowed by the Irish Carolingian scholar Johannes Scotus Eriugena in the 9th century, who went a step further than Capella by suggesting both Mars and Jupiter orbited the sun as well. In the 15th century by Nilakantha Somayaji, an Indian astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, presented a geoheliocentric system where all the planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth.

The Tychonic system, which was announced in 1588, became a major competitor with the Copernican system as an alternative to the Ptolemaic. After Galileo&#x27;s observation of the phases of Venus in 1610, most cosmological controversy then settled on variations of the Tychonic and Copernican systems. In a number of ways, the Tychonic system proved philosophically more intuitive than the Copernican system, as it reinforced commonsense notions of how the Sun and the planets are mobile while the Earth is not. Additionally, a Copernican system would suggest the ability to observe stellar parallax, which could not be observed until the 19th century. On the other hand, because of the intersecting deferents of Mars and the Sun (see diagram), it went against the Ptolemaic and Aristotelian notion that the planets were placed within nested spheres. Tycho and his followers revived the ancient Stoic philosophy instead, since it used fluid heavens which could accommodate intersecting circles.

=== Legacy ===
After Tycho&#x27;s death, Johannes Kepler used Tycho&#x27;s observations to demonstrate that the orbits of the planets are ellipses and not circles, creating the modified Copernican system that ultimately displaced both the Tychonic and Ptolemaic systems. However, the Tychonic system was very influential in the late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1616, during the Galileo affair, the papal Congregation of the Index banned all books advocating the Copernican system, including works by Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and other authors until 1758. The Tychonic system was an acceptable alternative as it explained the observed phases of Venus with a static Earth. Jesuit astronomers in China used it, as did a number of European scholars. Jesuits (such as Clavius, Christoph Grienberger, Christoph Scheiner, Odo Van Maelcote) supported the Tychonic system.

The discovery of stellar aberration in the early 18th century by James Bradley proved that the Earth did in fact move around the Sun and Tycho&#x27;s system fell out of use among scientists. In the modern era, some modern geocentrists use a modified Tychonic system with elliptical orbits, while rejecting the concept of relativity.

<doc id="276862" wikidata="Q456511" url="?curid=276862" title="Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy">
<text>Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy (; 1584–1660) was a French nobleman and Bailiff Grand Cross of the Knights of Malta. He governed the island of Saint Christopher from 1639 to his death in 1660, first under the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique and later under the Knights of Malta themselves. Poincy was the key figure in the Hospitaller colonization of the Americas.

On 12 January 1638 Poincy set sail for the Caribbean on board &quot;La Petite Europe&quot; On February 20 he took up his commission as Lieutenant Governor of the Isles of America and Captain general of the French at St Kitts. He arrived wearing the regalia of the Knights of St John of Malta and soon dispensed with the authority of the French king, declaring &quot;The people of St Kitts will have no other Governor than Poincy and will take no orders from the King of France.&quot;

In 1639 he reached an agreement with the English on St Kitts that neither nation should grow tobacco for one and a half years.

Poincy instructed one of his followers, the Huguenot Levasseur with sixty buccaneers, to drive the English out of Tortuga. Levasseur was successful, and on 6 November 1640 a treaty was drawn up between Poincy and Levasseur which allowed religious tolerance and trade between the two islands.

By 1642 Poincy started building the Château de la Montagne on his estate called La Fontaine. This was an elaborate building, credited as being one of the grandest ever constructed in the Americas, though today it is in ruins. The grounds of La Fontaine were also heavily planted with exotic tropical plants. The Poinciana (&quot;Caesalpinia pulcherrima&quot;) was named in his honor, the name later becoming secondarily associated with the Royal Poinciana (&quot;Delonix regia&quot;).

He had a Town Hall erected in Basseterre in what is now known as Church Street. This served as his administrative centre, where he dispensed justice and administered the colony.

On 26 December 1644, the French king sent Noël Patrocle de Thoisy to relieve him, Poincy refused to allow him to land. Eventually, Thoissy was sent back to France in chains. The Capuchins were also expelled at this time, for taking the side of Thoissy. The Jesuits were invited in to take their place. Poincy bought the nearby island of St Croix, which he bequeathed to the Knights of St John of Malta.

In 1648 he first seized the island of St Bartholomew, populated by 170 Europeans and fifty enslaved Africans. Then he sent his nephew, Robert de Lonvilliers, with 300 men to take over the French half of Saint Martin. This was ratified at the Treaty of Concordia. In 1650 he heard that the Spanish had evacuated St Croix, so he sent Vaugelan with two ships and one hundred and sixty men to capture it. The French had set fire to the trees which was why settlement was so difficult for the Spanish.

Following the intervention of the Knights of Malta in 1651, Poincy paid 90,000 livres to make peace with Thoissy. He persuaded Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, to pay 120,000 livres for St Kitts, St Croix, St Bartholomew, and St Martin. Although Poincy was immediately appointed as governor, Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny was soon appointed in his place. However, when Montmagny arrived, just as with Thoissy, Poincy refused to step aside. Montmagny was obliged to settle down in Cayenne, where he lived waiting for the death of Poincy. He would not live to see this, however, as he died first in 1657.

In 1653 the French king further entrenched the authority of the Knights of Malta on the four islands, retaining sovereignty over the islands with 1,000 crowns to be paid on the accession of each new French King.

Poincy died on 11 April 1660, at the age of 77. He was a Bailiff Grand cross of the Knights of Malta and Squadron commander of the French Brittany Fleet. He was buried in Basseterre, probably in the grounds of what is now St George&#x27;s church.

He is credited with turning Basseterre into a successful Caribbean trading port. The annual Saint Kitts carnival troupe, Les Actors, are people descended from a troupe of Acrobats from Africa whom he had imported to Saint Kitts as his slaves and personal performers for parties at La Fontaine.

<text>BBC America is an American basic cable network that is currently owned by AMC Networks since 2024 after buying the 50.01 stake it did not already own. The channel primarily airs sci-fi and action series and films, as well as selected programs from the BBC (such as its nature documentary series).

Unlike the BBC&#x27;s domestic channels in the United Kingdom, BBC America does not receive funding from the British licence fee (which is the principal funding for the BBC&#x27;s channels within the United Kingdom), as the BBC cannot fund any of its channels that are available outside the United Kingdom. Consequently, BBC America operates as a commercial-supported channel and accepts traditional advertising. It is also funded by television subscription fees.

, BBC America is available to approximately 60,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2017 peak of 82,000,000 households.

==History==
===Launch and early years===
BBC America was launched on March 29, 1998, presenting a mixture of comedy, drama and lifestyle programs from BBC Television and other British television broadcasters including ITV and Channel 4. In the channel&#x27;s early days, it focused on repeats of popular lifestyle shows such as &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; and &quot;Ground Force&quot;. BBC America&#x27;s head of television programming later stated that the channel needed to establish a niche, since non-British viewers found the lifestyle shows appealing. Most of the newer programs appeared as part of BBC America&#x27;s evening schedule.

The network removed the British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; from its schedule in 2003 due to low ratings; however, the program&#x27;s removal from BBC America provoked complaints from viewers, which caught media attention.

After CEO Paul Lee was appointed president of ABC Family in 2009, the network appointed Bill Hilary from Comedy Central to serve as its chief executive officer. Hilary appointed Kathryn Mitchell to the new position of general manager. Under Hilary&#x27;s tenure, BBC America was restructured; it moved its main offices to New York City and had its programming budget increase substantially. The channel was led by Garth Ancier, who served as the president of BBC Worldwide Americas from February 2007 until 2010, when he was succeeded by former MTV Networks executive Herb Scannell. Meanwhile, Perry Simon serves as general manager.

===AMC Networks joint venture (2014–2024)===
In 2014, AMC Networks acquired a 49.9% equity stake in BBC America for $200 million, and replaced Discovery Communications as its managing partner. As part of the deal, AMC Networks also took on the responsibility of negotiating U.S. broadcast and advertising sales for the regional variant BBC News (International). AMC Networks CEO Josh Sapan stated that the deal gave his company &quot;a powerful collection of networks that are among the most critically acclaimed, with distinct dramas and other potent content that creates a deep connection with viewers&quot;, while BBC Worldwide CEO Tim Davie considered it &quot;an opportunity to grow the creative quality and ambition from an already high base.&quot;

AMC Networks became a founding partner in the U.S. launch of BritBox, a streaming service operated by BBC Studios and ITV plc.

On Sunday, April 25, 2021, BBC America unveiled a redesigned logo and tagline – &quot;Brit-ish&quot;.

===Fully owned subsidiary of AMC Networks (2024–present)===
In AMC Networks&#x27; Q3 earnings report released November 8, 2024, the company announced that it had closed a deal with the BBC on the first of that month to buy it out of its 50.1% stake in BBC America for $42 million in cash, clarifying that the transaction would be the final time AMC was increasing a non-controlling interest by paying in cash. The report further stated, &quot;Assuming the transaction had closed on September 30, 2024, $132.9 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest related to BBC America, and reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, would have been eliminated. Additionally, the Company’s future contractual programming commitments to BBC Studios would have been significantly reduced.&quot; The BBC continues to maintain commercial ties with the channel.

==Programming==
Some of the programs on the channel are edited either for adult content or to allow for commercials. Occasionally, comedy shows are run in specially formatted 40-minute blocks and a few first-run drama programs are broadcast in a longer block that allows them to run to their original broadcast length. Additional series that has been previously broadcast may periodically return to the schedule as part of the network&#x27;s rotation of daytime programming.

===Original programming and co-productions===
In the mid-2000s, BBC America produced a few of its own original shows, along with some joint productions; including &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, part of the &quot;Sharpe&quot; series of made-for-television movies and co-produced with ITV; and &quot;The State Within&quot; and &quot;Jekyll&quot;, which were co-productions with the BBC. The first original series produced solely by the channel was &quot;Copper&quot;, which premiered in the summer of 2012.

BBC America has also branched into co-producing British series, including &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Musketeers, Killing Eve&quot;, &quot;Mood&quot; and from its fourth series, the revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (until 2022). They also co-produced the Canadian series &quot;Orphan Black&quot; with Bell Media&#x27;s Space channel.

===Newscasts===

BBC America used to broadcast &quot;BBC World News&quot; each Monday through Friday morning from 6:00 to 8:00 am Eastern and Pacific Time. All news programs now air exclusively on the BBC News Channel, also distributed by AMC Networks in the United States.

The weekday morning (6:00–9:00 am Eastern) simulcast used to include &quot;BBC World News&quot; bulletins, &quot;World Business Report&quot;, &quot;Sport Today&quot;, &quot;Asia Today&quot;, and a one-hour bulletin called &quot;World News Today&quot;. Most of these were removed from the schedule without any announcement on April 6, 2009. The weekend morning (6:00–6:30 am ET) simulcast was also abruptly dropped on April 4, 2009. According to BBC America, the simulcast was dropped because of disappointing ratings.

From 2007 to 2011, BBC America broadcast &quot;BBC World News America&quot;, a live Washington, D.C.–based program anchored by Matt Frei. Katty Kay served as a Washington-based correspondent. On February 18, 2011, network management announced that &quot;BBC World News America&quot; would be dropped from BBC America and would instead be broadcasting only on the BBC World News channel and PBS member stations in the United States.

The network was in discussions to unveil a weekly news program fronted by &quot;Newsnight&quot; host Jeremy Paxman, who was to introduce a synopsis of &quot;Newsnight&quot; items with an international aspect and was expected to bring his interviewing style to bear on American politicians. An international edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot; debuted on February 29, 2008, in the 10 pm time slot. This program was cancelled in November 2008, but the announcement of the program&#x27;s cancellation was not made until April 2009.

During major breaking news events, the network sometimes replaces scheduled programs with coverage from BBC News; the London bombings in July 2005 was one example. BBC News&#x27;s American coverage started out sparse, but has expanded within the last decade on several providers throughout the United States, generally alongside BBC America as part of AMC Networks&#x27; retransmission consent negotiations (one previous example is New York City-based Cablevision, which did not carry BBC America until August 2011) or &quot;BBC World News America&quot;, an American-focused news program presented by Katty Kay and usually from Washington, D.C., mainly carried by American public television stations through a distribution agreement with Washington PBS member station WETA-TV.

=== Sports ===
BBC America has carried coverage of the PDC World Darts Championship in simulcast with Sky Sports, with preliminary rounds streaming, and the finals airing on television.

<text>Critical thinking is the process of analyzing available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments to make sound conclusions or informed choices. It involves recognizing underlying assumptions, providing justifications for ideas and actions, evaluating these justifications through comparisons with varying perspectives, and assessing their rationality and potential consequences. The goal of critical thinking is to form a judgment through the application of rational, skeptical, and unbiased analyses and evaluation. In modern times, the use of the phrase &quot;critical thinking&quot; can be traced to John Dewey, who used the phrase &quot;reflective thinking,&quot; which depends on the knowledge base of an individual; the excellence of critical thinking in which an individual can engage varies according to it. According to philosopher Richard W. Paul, critical thinking and analysis are competencies that can be learned or trained. The application of critical thinking includes self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective habits of the mind, as critical thinking is not a natural process; it must be induced, and ownership of the process must be taken for successful questioning and reasoning. Critical thinking presupposes a rigorous commitment to overcome egocentrism and sociocentrism, that leads to a mindful command of effective communication and problem solving.

==History==
In the classical period (5th c.–4th c. BC) of Ancient Greece, the philosopher Plato (428–347 BC) indicated that the teachings of Socrates (470–399 BC) are the earliest records of what today is called critical thinking. In an early dialogue by Plato, the philosopher Socrates debates several speakers about the ethical matter of the rightness or wrongness of Socrates escaping from prison. Upon consideration, Plato concluded that to escape prison would violate everything he believes to be greater than himself: the laws of Athens and the guiding voice that Socrates claims to hear.

Socrates established the unreliability of Authority and of authority figures to possess knowledge and consequent insight; that for an individual man or woman to lead a good life that is worth living, that person must ask critical questions and possess an interrogative soul, which seeks evidence and then closely examines the available facts, and then follows the implications of the statement under analysis, thereby tracing the implications of &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;action&quot;.

As a form of co-operative argumentation, Socratic questioning requires the comparative judgment of facts, which answers then would reveal the person&#x27;s irrational thinking and lack of verifiable knowledge. Socrates also demonstrated that Authority does not ensure accurate, verifiable knowledge; thus, Socratic questioning analyses beliefs, assumptions, and presumptions, by relying upon evidence and a sound rationale.

In modern times, the phrase &quot;critical thinking&quot; was coined by Pragmatist philosopher John Dewey in his book &quot;How We Think.&quot; As a type of intellectualism, the development of &quot;critical thinking&quot; is a means of &quot;critical analysis&quot; that applies rationality to develop a critique of the subject matter. According to the Foundation for Critical Thinking, in 1987 the U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking defined critical thinking as the &quot;intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&quot;

==Etymology and origin of critical thinking==
In the term &quot;critical thinking&quot;, the word &quot;&quot;, (Grk. κριτικός = &quot;kritikos&quot; = &quot;critic&quot;) derives from the word &quot;critic&quot; and implies a critique; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means &quot;of judging&quot;, &quot;of judgement&quot;, &quot;for judging&quot;, and of being &quot;able to discern&quot;. The intellectual roots of critical thinking are as ancient as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the critical reasoning of the Presocractic philosophers, as well as the teaching practice and vision of Socrates 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to knowledge.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the exact term “critical thinking” first appeared in 1815, in the British literary journal &quot;The Critical Review&quot;, referring to critical analysis in the literary context. The meaning of &quot;critical thinking&quot; gradually evolved and expanded to mean a desirable general thinking skill by the end of the 19th century and early 20th century.

==Definitions==
Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:
* &quot;The intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&quot;
* &quot;Disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence&quot;
* &quot;Purposeful, self-regulatory judgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is based&quot;
* &quot;Includes a commitment to using reason in the formulation of our beliefs&quot;
* The skill and propensity to engage in an activity with reflective scepticism (McPeck, 1981)
* Thinking about one&#x27;s thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one&#x27;s own thinking. Critical thinking is not &#x27;hard&#x27; thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than &#x27;improving&#x27; one&#x27;s own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the rationality of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one&#x27;s process of thinking.
* &quot;An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation&quot;
* &quot;Critical thinking is a type of thinking pattern that requires people to be reflective, and pay attention to decision-making which guides their beliefs and actions. Critical thinking allows people to deduct with more logic, to process sophisticated information and look at various sides of an issue so they can produce more solid conclusions.&quot;
* Critical thinking has seven critical features: being inquisitive and curious, being open-minded to different sides, being able to think systematically, being analytical, being persistent to truth, being confident about critical thinking itself, and lastly, being mature.
* Although critical thinking could be defined in several different ways, there is a general agreement in its key component—the desire to reach for a satisfactory result, and this should be achieved by rational thinking and result-driven manner. Halpern thinks that critical thinking firstly involves learned abilities such as problem-solving, calculation and successful probability application. It also includes a tendency to engage the thinking process. In recent times, Stanovich believed that modern IQ testing could hardly measure the ability of critical thinking.
*&quot;Critical thinking is essentially a questioning, challenging approach to knowledge and perceived wisdom. It involves ideas and information from an objective position and then questioning this information in the light of our own values, attitudes and personal philosophy.&quot;
Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness. Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.

# According to Ennis, &quot;Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&quot; This definition Ennis provided is highly agreed by Harvey Siegel, Peter Facione, and Deanna Kuhn.
# According to Ennis&#x27; definition, critical thinking requires a lot of attention and brain function. When a critical thinking approach is applied to education, it helps the student&#x27;s brain function better and understand texts differently.
# Different fields of study may require different types of critical thinking. Critical thinking provides more angles and perspectives upon the same material.

==Logic and rationality==

The study of logical argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking. Logic is concerned with the analysis of arguments, including the appraisal of their correctness or incorrectness. In the field of epistemology, critical thinking is considered to be logically correct thinking, which allows for differentiation between logically true and logically false statements.

In &quot;First wave&quot; logical thinking, the thinker is removed from the train of thought, and the analysis of connections between concepts or points in thought is ostensibly free of any bias. In his essay &quot;Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking&quot; Kerry S. Walters describes this ideology thus: &quot;A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective. This model of thinking has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon&quot;. Such principles are concomitant with the increasing dependence on a &quot;quantitative&quot; understanding of the world.

In the &#x27;second wave&#x27; of critical thinking, authors consciously moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking characteristic of the &#x27;first wave&#x27;. Although many scholars began to take a less exclusive view of what constitutes critical thinking, rationality and logic remain widely accepted as essential bases for critical thinking. Walters argues that exclusive logicism in the first wave sense is based on &quot;the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking&quot;.

===Deduction, abduction and induction===
There are three types of logical reasoning. Informally, two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal deduction, which are induction and abduction.

====Deduction====
* Deduction is the conclusion drawn from the structure of an argument&#x27;s premises, by use of rules of inference formally those of propositional calculus. For example: X is human and all humans have a face, so X has a face.

====Induction====
* Induction is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies. For example: The sum of even integers is even. Let formula_1 then formula_2 are even by definition. If formula_3, then formula_4, which is even; so summing two even numbers results in an even number.

====Abduction====
* Abduction is drawing a conclusion using a heuristic that is likely, but not inevitable given some foreknowledge. For example: I observe sheep in a field, and they appear white from my viewing angle, so sheep are white. Contrast with the deductive statement: Some sheep are white on at least one side.

===Critical thinking and rationality===
Kerry S. Walters, an emeritus philosophy professor from Gettysburg College, argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the &quot;calculus of justification&quot; but also considers &quot;cognitive acts such as imagination, conceptual creativity, intuition and insight&quot;. These &quot;functions&quot; are focused on discovery, on more abstract processes instead of linear, rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the rational mind.

The ability to critically analyze an argument — to dissect structure and components, thesis and reasons — is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and metacognition. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:

* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only logic but broad intellectual criteria such as clarity, credibility, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, significance, and fairness.

Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem-solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize unstated assumptions and values
* Comprehend and use language with accuracy, clarity, and 
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one&#x27;s patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

&quot;A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends.&quot;

Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of internalization, in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content. And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners&#x27; lives.

=== In professional fields ===
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of scientific skepticism, the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a well-justified conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, psychological thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical-thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective contextualization. Psychology offerings, for example, have included courses such as Critical Thinking about the Paranormal, in which students are subjected to a series of cold readings and tested on their belief of the &quot;psychic&quot;, who is eventually announced to be a fake.

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields for enabling one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure thinking, thereby ensuring the act of thinking without false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes occur, and due to a thinker&#x27;s inability to apply the methodology consistently, and because of overruling character traits such as egocentrism. Critical thinking includes identification of prejudice, bias, propaganda, self-deception, distortion, misinformation, etc. Given research in cognitive psychology, some educators believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical-thinking skills and cultivation of intellectual traits.

Critical-thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical-thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates &quot;new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge&quot;. Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical-thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario&#x27;s Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006). 
It requires nurses to engage in Reflective Practice and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the college.

==Habits or traits of the mind==
The habits of mind that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem-solving, inquisitiveness, even-handedness, and confidence in reasoning.

According to a definition analysis by Kompf &amp; Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem-solving, decision making, metacognition, rationality, rational thinking, reasoning, knowledge, intelligence and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

There is a postulation by some writers that the tendencies from habits of mind should be thought as virtues to demonstrate the characteristics of a critical thinker. These intellectual virtues are ethical qualities that encourage motivation to think in particular ways towards specific circumstances. However, these virtues have also been criticized by skeptics who argue that the evidence is lacking for a specific mental basis underpinning critical thinking.

==Teaching critical thinking==
John Dewey is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and democracy.

In a 2014 meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 341 quasi- or true-experimental studies of teaching critical thinking, all of which used some form of standardized critical-thinking measure. The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize differing assessment tools, which include standardized tests (and second-source measures), tests developed by teachers, tests developed by researchers, and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the researcher. The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance of encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment. Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of educational settings. One attempt to assess the humanities&#x27; role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in pseudoscientific claims was made at North Carolina State University. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.

Historically, the teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors&#x27; research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking. 
Scott Lilienfeld notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical-thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.

In the English and Welsh school systems, &quot;Critical Thinking&quot; is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an A-Level.

=== Well-educated citizens ===

In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher education noted concerns that higher education was failing to meet society&#x27;s requirements for well-educated citizens. It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students&#x27; thinking skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of cognition, rather than developing intellect or values.

Critical thinking is also considered important for human rights education for toleration. The Declaration of Principles on Tolerance adopted by UNESCO in 1995 affirms that &quot;education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, &quot;critical thinking&quot; and ethical reasoning&quot;.

==Assessment of critical thinking==
Under the OCR exam board, students can sit two exam papers for the Advanced Subsidiary: &quot;Credibility of Evidence&quot; and &quot;Assessing and Developing Argument&quot;. The full Advanced GCE is now available: in addition to the two Advanced Subsidiary units, candidates sit the two papers &quot;Resolution of Dilemmas&quot; and &quot;Critical Reasoning&quot;. The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions. Nevertheless, the Advanced Subsidiary is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced GCE is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or theology, providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an Advanced Extension Award offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. Cambridge International Examinations have an A-level in Thinking Skills.

From 2008, Assessment and Qualifications Alliance has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.
OCR exam board have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical-thinking component, such as the LNAT, the UKCAT, the BioMedical Admissions Test and the Thinking Skills Assessment.

In Qatar, critical thinking was offered by Al-Bairaq - an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targeted high school students and focussed on a curriculum based on STEM fields. The idea behind this was to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.

==Research of critical thinking==
After undertaking research in schools, Edward M. Glaser proposed in 1941 that the ability to think critically involves three elements:
# An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one&#x27;s experiences
# Knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning
# Some skill in applying those methods.

The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab, London, is involved in the scientific study of all major educational systems in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective. This presents a problem that is detailed as a division of a critical mind in juxtaposition to sensory data and memory.

The psychological theory disposes of the absolute nature of the rational mind, in reference to conditions, abstract problems and discursive limitations. Where the relationship between critical-thinking skills and critical-thinking dispositions is an empirical question, the ability to attain causal domination exists, for which Socrates was known to be largely disposed against as the practice of Sophistry. Accounting for a measure of &quot;critical-thinking dispositions&quot; is the California Measure of Mental Motivation and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory. The Critical Thinking Toolkit is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking.

==Online communication==
The advent and rising popularity of online courses have prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication promotes, hinders, or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course (relative to face-to-face communication). There is some evidence to suggest a fourth, more nuanced possibility: that online communication may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example, Guiller et al. (2008) found that, relative to face-to-face discourse, online discourse featured more justifications, while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions, while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of &#x27;real-time&#x27; discussion. Newman et al. (1995) showed similar differential effects. They found that while online communications boasted more important statements and linking of ideas, it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather, the asynchrony may promote users to put forth &quot;considered, thought out contributions&quot;.

Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis, where the text of online discourse (or the transcription of face-to-face discourse) is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example, a statement might be coded as &quot;Discuss ambiguities to clear them up&quot; or &quot;Welcoming outside knowledge&quot; as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely, statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as &quot;Sticking to prejudice or assumptions&quot; or &quot;Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge&quot;. The frequency of these codes in online communication and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.

Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn (1991), which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development, but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example, research has shown that three- to four-year-old children can discern, to some extent, the differential credibility and expertise of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical-thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States. If the development of critical-thinking skills was solely due to maturation, it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.
