<text>The killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) is a large plover found in the Americas. It gets its name from its shrill, two-syllable call, which is often heard. It was described and given its current scientific name in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Three subspecies are described. Its are mostly brown with rufous fringes, the head has patches of white and black, and two black bands cross the breast. The belly and the rest of the breast are white. The nominate (or originally described) subspecies breeds from southeastern Alaska and southern Canada to Mexico. It is seen year-round in the southern half of its breeding range; the subspecies &quot;C. v. ternominatus&quot; is resident in the West Indies, and &quot;C. v. peruvianus&quot; inhabits Peru and surrounding South American countries throughout the year. North American breeders winter from their resident range south to Central America, the West Indies, and the northernmost portions of South America. Despite their name, they are not known for killing deer.

The nonbreeding habitat of the killdeer includes coastal wetlands, beach habitats, and coastal fields. Its breeding grounds are generally open fields with short vegetation (but locations such as rooftops are sometimes used); although it is a shorebird, it does not necessarily nest close to water. The nest itself is a scrape lined with vegetation and white material, such as pebbles or seashell fragments. This bird lays a clutch of four to six buff to beige eggs with dark markings. The breeding season (starting with egg-laying) occurs from mid-March to August, with later timing of egg-laying in the northern portion of the range. Both parents incubate the eggs for 22 to 28 days typically. The young stay in the nest until the day after being hatched, when they are led by their parents to a feeding territory (generally with dense vegetation where hiding spots are abundant), where the chicks feed themselves. The young then fledge about 31 days after hatching, and breeding first occurs after one year of age.

The killdeer primarily feeds on insects, although other invertebrates and seeds are eaten. It forages almost exclusively in fields, especially those with short vegetation and with cattle and standing water. It primarily forages during the day, but in the nonbreeding season, when the moon is full or close to full, it forages at night, likely because of increased insect abundance and reduced predation during the night. Predators of the killdeer include various birds and mammals. Its multiple responses to predation range from calling to the &quot;ungulate display&quot;, which can be fatal for the performing individual. The killdeer was formerly considered a least-concern species by the IUCN due to its large range and population, but is now considered a near-threatened species due to its population decline, though the decline is not rapid enough to warrant uplisting the killdeer to a vulnerable species. It is protected by the American Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the Canadian Migratory Birds Convention Act.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
The killdeer was described in 1758 by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Charadrius vociferus&quot;, its current scientific name. Linnaeus&#x27; description was based on a 1731 account of it by English naturalist Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;, where he called it the &quot;chattering plover&quot;. The genus name &quot;Charadrius&quot; is Late Latin for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate Bible. This word derives from the Ancient Greek &quot;kharadrios&quot;, a bird found in ravines and river valleys (&quot;kharadra&quot;, &quot;ravine&quot;). The specific name &quot; vociferus &quot; is Latin, coming from &quot;vox&quot;, &quot;cry&quot;, and &quot; ferre&quot;, &quot;to bear&quot;.

Three subspecies are described:
* &quot;C. v. vociferus&quot; – The nominate subspecies (originally described subspecies), it is found in the US (including southeastern Alaska), southern Canada, Mexico, and with some less widespread grounds further south, to Panama. It winters to northwestern South America.
* &quot;C. v. ternominatus&quot; – This subspecies is found on the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and Virgin Islands.
* &quot;C. v. peruvianus&quot; – This South American subspecies is found in western Ecuador, Peru, and extreme northwest Chile.

The killdeer&#x27;s common name comes from its frequently heard call.

==Description==
The killdeer is a large plover, with adults ranging in length from , having a wingspan between , and usually being between in weight. It has a short, thick, and dark bill, flesh-colored legs, and a red eye ring.
Its upper parts are mostly brown with rufous fringes, its cap, back, and wings being the former color. It has a white forehead and a white stripe behind the eye, and its lores and the upper borders to the white forehead are black. The killdeer also has a white collar with a black upper border. The rest of the face is brown. The breast and belly are white, except for two black breast bands. It is the only plover in North America with two breast bands. The rump is red, and the tail is mostly brown. The latter also has a black band, a white band, and barred white feathers on the outer portion of the tail. A white wing stripe at the base of the flight feathers is visible in flight.

The female&#x27;s mask and breast bands tend to be browner than those of the male. The adult of the subspecies &quot;C. v. ternominatus&quot; is smaller, paler, and greyer than the nominate. The subspecies &quot;C. v. peruvianus&quot; is smaller than the nominate and has more extensive rufous feather fringes. The juvenile is similar to the adult. The upper parts of the chicks are colored dusky and buff. Their underparts, forehead, neck, and chin are white, and they have a single band across their breast.

The killdeer is a vocal species, calling even at night. Its calls include nasal notes, like &quot;deee&quot;, &quot;tyeeee&quot;, and &quot;kil-deee&quot; (the basis of its common name). During display flights, it repeats a call of &quot;kil-deer&quot; or &quot;kee-deeyu&quot;. When this plover is disturbed, it emits notes in a rapid sequence, such as &quot;kee-di-di-di&quot;. Its is a long, fast trill.

==Habitat and distribution==

The nominate subspecies of the killdeer breeds in the US (including southeastern Alaska), southern Canada, and Mexico, with less widespread grounds further south, to Panama. Some northern populations are migratory. This bird is resident in the southern half of its breeding range, found throughout the year in most of the contiguous United States. It also winters south to Central America, the West Indies, Colombia, Ecuador, and islands off Venezuela, leaving its breeding grounds after mid-July, with migration peaking from August to September. Migration to the breeding grounds starts in February and ends in mid-May.

The subspecies &quot;C. v. ternominatus&quot; is thought to be resident in the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and Virgin Islands. &quot;C. v. peruvianus&quot; is seen year-round in western Ecuador, Peru, and extreme northwestern Chile.

The killdeer uses beach habitats, coastal wetlands, and fields during the non-breeding season. It forages almost exclusively in these fields, especially those with short vegetation and with cattle (which likely shorten the vegetation) and standing water. When breeding, the killdeer has a of about , although this is generally larger when nesting more than away from water. Although generally a low-land species, it is found up to the snowline in meadows and open lakeshores during its autumn migration.

==Behavior==

===Breeding===

The killdeer forms pairs on its breeding grounds right after arriving. Both sexes (although the male more often than the female) advertise in flight with loud &quot;killdeer&quot; calls. The male also advertises by calling from a high spot, scraping out a dummy nest, and with killdeer flights, where it flies with slow wingbeats across its territory. Ground chases occur when a killdeer has been approached multiple times by another killdeer; similarly, flight chases occur when an individual has been approached from the air. Both are forms of territorial defense.

The killdeer nests in open fields or other flat areas with short vegetation (usually below tall), such as agricultural fields and meadows. Nests are also sometimes located on rooftops. This plover frequently breeds close to where it bred the previous year. The male seems to usually renest in the same area regardless of whether or not he retains the same mate. This does not appear to be true of the female, which has been observed to not use the same territory if she does not have the same mate. The nest itself is merely a shallow depression or scrape in the ground, fringed by some stones and blades of grass. It is generally built with white nesting material instead of darker colors; the function of this is suspected to either help keep the nest cool or conceal it. In a study of piping plovers, the former function was supported, as nests were to cooler than the surrounding ground. The latter function also had some support, as the plovers generally chose pebbles closer in color to the eggs; nests that contrasted more with the ground suffered more predation. When nesting on rooftops, the killdeer may choose a flat roof, or build a nest of raised gravel, sometimes lined with white pebbles or pieces of seashells.

The eggs of the killdeer are typically laid from mid-March to early June in the southern portion of the range, and from mid-April to mid-July in the northern part. In both cases, the breeding season itself extends to about August. In Puerto Rico, and possibly in other Caribbean islands, breeding occurs year-round.

The killdeer lays a clutch of four to six eggs that are buff to beige, with brown markings and black speckles. The eggs are about in size, and laid at intervals of 24 to 48 hours. The energy expenditure of both sexes is at its highest during egg-laying; the female needs to produce eggs, and the male needs to defend his territory. Both of the sexes are closer to the nest site than usual during egg-laying and incubation, although the male is generally closer than the female during all stages of breeding. This latter fact is likely due to the male&#x27;s increased investment in nest-site defense. Up to five replacement clutches can be laid, and occasionally two broods occur. Second broods are usually laid in the nesting territory of the first brood. The eggs are incubated for 22 to 28 days by both the male and the female, with the former typically incubating at night. The time dedicated to incubation is related to temperature, with one study recording that killdeer incubated eggs 99% of the time when the temperature was about , 76% of the time around , and 87% of the time at about . When it is hot (above at least ), incubation cools the eggs, generally through shading by one of the parents.
About 53% of eggs are lost, mainly to predators. The young are precocial, starting to walk within the first days of their life. After they hatch, both parents lead them out of the nest, generally to a feeding territory with dense vegetation under which the chicks can hide when a predator is near. The chicks are raised, at least in single-brood pairs, by both parents, likely because of the high failure rate of nests and the need for both parents to be present to successfully raise the young. In these broods, the young are usually attended by one parent at a time (generally the female) until about two weeks of age, after which both parents are occasionally seen together with the chicks. Otherwise, the inattentive adult is at least about away from the chicks. Periods of attentiveness for each parent generally last from about one to one and a half hours. When the chicks are young, this is mainly spent standing; as the chicks get older, less time is dedicated to standing. When the young are below two weeks of age, the attending adult spends little time feeding; foraging time increases as the chicks grow. The inattentive adult defends the young most of the time when they are less than a week old, but this task steadily shifts onto the attentive adult, until about three weeks of age, when the attending parent does almost all of the defense. One parent at a time broods the chicks and does so frequently until they are two days old. The young are brooded during the day until about 15 days after hatching and during the night for about 18 days after hatching. The only time when they are not in the presence of a parent is when the parents are mating or responding to a predator or aggressive conspecific.

When a pair has two broods, the second is usually attended by just the male (which can hatch the eggs on his own, unlike the female). In this case, the male does not spend most of the time standing; the amount of time he does stand, though, stays constant as the chicks age. Like attentive adults in two-parent broods, the sole parent increases the time spent foraging as the young age.

The young fledge about 31 days after hatching, and generally move to moister areas in valleys and on the banks of rivers. They may be cared for by their parents for up to 10 days after they fledge, and exceptionally for 81 days after hatching. About 52 to 63% of nests fail to produce any fledged young. Breeding starts after one year of age. The killdeer has a maximum lifespan of 10 years and 11 months.

===Feeding===
The killdeer feeds primarily on insects (especially beetles and flies), in addition to millipedes, worms, snails, spiders, and some seeds. It opportunistically takes tree frogs and dead minnows. It forages almost exclusively in fields (no matter the tide), especially those with short vegetation and with cattle (which likely shorten the vegetation) and standing water. Standing water alone does not have a significant effect on field choice unless combined with cattle. Viable disseminules can be recovered from killdeer feces, indicating that this bird is important in transporting aquatic organisms.

The killdeer uses visual cues to forage. An example of this is &quot;foot-trembling&quot;, where it stands on one foot, shaking the other in shallow water for about five seconds, pecking at any prey stirred up. When feeding in fields, it sometimes follows plows to take earthworms disturbed to the surface. The female forages significantly more than the male during most stages of breeding. The former feeds the most before and during egg-laying, the least when incubation starts (as little time to feed remains), with a return to high levels after. During the nonbreeding season, the killdeer forages during the night, depending on the lunar cycle. When the moon is full, it feeds more at night and roosts more during the day. Foraging at night has benefits for this bird, including increased insect abundance and reduced predation.

==Predators and parasites==
The killdeer is parasitized by acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes. It is preyed upon by herring gulls, common crows, raccoons, and striped skunks. The mentioned birds and other avian predators are the majority of predators in some areas during the breeding season. Predation is not limited to eggs and chicks: mustelids, for example, can kill incubating adults.

===Responses to predators===

The parents use various methods to distract predators during the breeding season. One method is the &quot;broken-wing display&quot;, also known as &quot;injury feigning&quot;. Before displaying, it usually runs from its nest, making alarm calls and other disturbances. When the bird has the attention of the predator, the former turns its tail towards the latter, displaying the threatening orange color of the rump. It then crouches, droops its wings, and lowers its tail, which is more common for them. With increasing intensity, the wings are held higher, the tail is fanned out, and the tail becomes more depressed. Another behavior that has received attention is the &quot;ungulate display&quot;, where the adult raises its wings, exposes its rump, lowers its head, and charges at the intruder. This can be fatal to the displaying bird.

The intensity of the responses to predators varies throughout the breeding season. During egg-laying, the most common response to predators is to quietly leave the nest. As incubation starts and progresses, the intensity of predator responses increases, peaking after hatching. This is probably because it is worth more to protect the young then, as they are more likely to fledge. After hatching, reactions decrease in intensity, until a normal response is called. This is because the young become more independent as they age.

==Conservation status==
The killdeer was formerly considered a least-concern species by the IUCN due to its large range of about and population, estimated by the IUCN to be about one million birds, or about two million, according to the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive&quot;. As of 2024, it is considered a near-threatened species due to its population decline, though the decline is not rapid enough to warrant uplisting the killdeer to a vulnerable species. It is protected in the US by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and in Canada by the Migratory Birds Convention Act.

<text>Islamic architecture comprises the architectural styles of buildings associated with Islam. It encompasses both secular and religious styles from the early history of Islam to the present day. The Islamic world encompasses a wide geographic area historically ranging from western Africa and Europe to eastern Asia. Certain commonalities are shared by Islamic architectural styles across all these regions, but over time different regions developed their own styles according to local materials and techniques, local dynasties and patrons, different regional centers of artistic production, and sometimes different religious affiliations.

Early Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine, Iranian, and Mesopotamian architecture and all other lands which the early Muslim conquests conquered in the seventh and eighth centuries. Later it developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings and in the decoration of surfaces with Islamic calligraphy, arabesques, and geometric motifs. New architectural elements like minarets, &quot;muqarnas&quot;, and multifoil arches were invented. Common or important types of buildings in Islamic architecture include mosques, madrasas, tombs, palaces, hammams (public baths), Sufi hospices (e.g. khanqahs or zawiyas), fountains and sabils, commercial buildings (e.g. caravanserais and bazaars), and military fortifications.

==Early history (up to 10th century)==
=== Origins ===
The Islamic era began with the formation of Islam under the leadership of Muhammad in early 7th-century Arabia. The first mosque was a structure built by Muhammad in Medina in 622, right after his &quot;Hijrah&quot; (migration) from Mecca, which corresponds to the site of the present-day Mosque of the Prophet (&quot;al-Masjid an-Nabawi&quot;). It is usually described as his house, but may have been designed to serve as a community center from the beginning. It consisted of a simple courtyard structure built in unbaked brick, with a rectangular, almost square, floor plan measuring about 53 by 56 meters. A shaded portico supported by palm trunks stood on the north side of the courtyard, in the direction of prayer (the &quot;qibla&quot;), which was initially towards Jerusalem. When the &quot;qibla&quot; was changed to face towards Mecca in 624, a similar portico was added on the south side, facing towards that city. Muhammad and his family lived in separate rooms attached to the mosque, and Muhammad himself was buried in one of these rooms upon his death in 632. Over the rest of the 7th century and in the 8th century the mosque was repeatedly expanded to include a large flat-roofed prayer hall supported by columns (a hypostyle hall) with a central courtyard. It became one of the main models for the early mosques built elsewhere. Scholars generally agree that aside from Muhammad&#x27;s mosque/house, the architecture of the Arabian Peninsula seems to have had only a limited role in the formulation of later Islamic architecture.

Prior to the start of the Arab-Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the two major powers in the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean world were the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and the Sasanian Empire. These two empires both cultivated their own major architectural traditions. Occupying the borderlands between these two empires – in the desert and steppe regions of Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia and northern Arabia – were two Arab tribal client states: the Lakhmids, who were clients of the Sasanians and had their capital at al-Hira (in present-day Iraq), and the Ghassanids, who were clients of the Byzantines and protected their eastern borders. These two Arab dynasties were significant patrons of architecture in their respective regions. Their architecture is not well understood due to the scarcity of identifiable remains today, but they borrowed and adapted the architecture of their Byzantine and Sasanian suzerains. Some of their buildings are known from archeology or historical texts, such as the Lakhmid palaces of Khawarnaq and al-Sadir in al-Hira, a Ghassanid church with mosaic decoration at Nitil (near Madaba), and a Ghassanid audience hall incorporated into the later Umayyad rural residence at ar-Rusafa. The culture and architecture of the Lakhmids and Ghassanids probably played a subsequent role in transmitting and filtering the architectural traditions of the Sasanian and the Byzantine/Roman worlds to the later Arab Islamic dynasties who established their political centers in the same regions.

When the early Arab-Muslim conquests spread out from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century and advanced across the Middle East and North Africa, new garrison cities were established in the conquered territories, such as Fustat in Egypt and Kufa in present-day Iraq. The central congregational mosques of these cities were built in the hypostyle format. In other cities, especially in Syria, new mosques were established by converting or occupying parts of existing churches in existing cities, as for example in Damascus and Hama. These early mosques had no minaret, although small shelters may have been constructed on the roofs to protect the muezzin while issuing the call to prayer.

=== Umayyad era ===
The Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) combined elements of Byzantine architecture and Sasanian architecture, but Umayyad architecture introduced new combinations of these styles. The reuse of elements from classical Roman and Byzantine art was still widely evident because political power and patronage was centered in Syria, a former Roman/Byzantine province. Some former Ghassanid structures also appear to have been reused and modified during this period. However, a significant amount of experimentation occurred as Umayyad patrons recruited craftsmen from across the empire and architects were allowed, or even encouraged, to mix elements from different artistic traditions and to disregard traditional conventions and restraints. Partly as a result of this, Umayyad architecture is distinguished by the extent and variety of decoration, including mosaics, wall painting, sculpture and carved reliefs. While figural scenes were notably present in monuments like Qusayr &#x27;Amra, non-figural decoration and more abstract scenes became highly favoured, especially in religious architecture. The Umayyad period thus played a crucial role in transforming and enriching existing architectural traditions during the formation of early Islamic society&#x27;s visual culture.
The Umayyads were the first to add the &quot;mihrab&quot; to mosque design, a concave niche in the &quot;qibla&quot; wall of the mosque. The first &quot;mihrab&quot; reportedly appeared at Muhammad&#x27;s mosque in Medina when it was rebuilt by al-Walid I in 707. It seems to have represented the place where the Prophet stood when leading prayer. This almost immediately became a standard feature of all mosques. Several major early monuments of Islamic architecture built under the Umayyads include the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem (built by Caliph Abd al-Malik) and the Great Mosque of Damascus (built by al-Walid I). The Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Al-Aqsa compound, also in Jerusalem, was also rebuilt by al-Walid I, replacing an earlier simple structure built around 670. A number of palaces from this period have also partially survived or have been excavated in modern times. The horseshoe arch appears for the first time in Umayyad architecture, later to evolve to its most advanced form in al-Andalus (Iberian Peninsula).
The Dome of the Rock has a centralized floor plan with an octagonal layout. This was most likely modeled on earlier Byzantine martyria in the region that had a similar form, such as the Church of the Kathisma. Despite the religious and historical importance of the Dome of the Rock, its layout did not frequently serve as a model for major Islamic monuments after it. In hypostyle mosques, the Umayyads introduced the tradition of making the &quot;nave&quot; or aisle in front of the &quot;mihrab&quot; wider than the others, dividing the prayer room along its central axis. This innovation was probably inspired by the layout of existing Christian basilicas in the region. Both the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Great Mosque of Damascus feature a hypostyle hall in this fashion, with a dome above the space in front of the &quot;mihrab&quot;, and both were influential in the design of later mosques elsewhere. The Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque are also notable for their extensive program of mosaic decoration that drew on late Antique motifs and craftsmanship. However, mosaic decoration eventually fell out of fashion in Islamic architecture.

=== Abbasid era ===
The Abbasid architecture of the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1513) was particularly influenced by Sasanian architecture, which in turn featured elements present since ancient Mesopotamia. Other influences such as ancient Soghdian architecture in Central Asia have also been noted. This was partly a result of the caliphate&#x27;s political center shifting further east to the new capital of Baghdad, in present-day Iraq. The Abbasids also built other capital cities, such as Samarra in the 9th century, which is now a major archeological site that has provided numerous insights into the evolution of Islamic art and architecture during this time. During the Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s golden years in the 8th and 9th centuries, its great power and unity allowed architectural fashions and innovations to spread quickly to other areas of the Islamic world under its influence.
Features from the late Umayyad period, such as vaulting, carved stucco, and painted wall decoration, were continued and elaborated in the Abbasid period. The four-centred arch, a more sophisticated form of the pointed arch, is first attested during the Abbasid period in monuments at Samarra, such as the Qasr al-Ashiq palace, and became widely used in some regions at later periods. Samarra also saw the appearance of new decorative styles, particularly in stucco and plasterwork, which rendered the earlier vegetal motifs of late antique traditions into more abstract and stylized forms, as exemplified by the so-called &quot;beveled&quot; style. These decorative techniques quickly spread to other regions where stucco decoration played a prominent role.

Abbasid mosques all followed the courtyard plan with hypostyle halls. The earliest was the mosque that Caliph al-Mansur built in Baghdad (since destroyed). The Great Mosque of Samarra built by al-Mutawakkil measured , had a flat wooden roof supported by columns, and was decorated with marble panels and glass mosaics. The prayer hall of the Abu Dulaf Mosque at Samarra had arcades on rectangular brick piers running at right angles to the &quot;qibla&quot; wall. Both of the Samarra mosques have spiral minarets, the only examples in Iraq. A mosque at Balkh in what is now Afghanistan was about square, with three rows of three square bays, supporting nine vaulted domes.

While the origins of the minaret are uncertain, it is believed that the first true minarets appeared in this period. Several of the Abbasid mosques built in the early ninth century had minaret towers which stood at the northern ends of the building, opposite the central &quot;mihrab&quot;. Among the most famous of these is the Malwiyya minaret, a stand-alone tower with a &quot;spiral&quot; form built for the Great Mosque of Samarra.

=== Early regional styles ===

After the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate in 750 by the Abbasids, a new branch of the Umayyad dynasty succeeded in taking control of Al-Andalus in 756, creating the Emirate of Córdoba and reaching the apogee of its power during the Caliphate of Córdoba in the 10th century. The Great Mosque of Córdoba, built in 785–786, marks the earliest major monument of Moorish architecture in the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus). This style of architecture established in Al-Andalus was also largely shared with the architecture of western North Africa (the Maghreb), from which later empires in the region would also emerge and contribute to its artistic evolution. The original Great Mosque of Cordoba was noted for its unique hypostyle hall with rows of double-tiered, two-coloured, arches, which were repeated and maintained in later extensions of the building. The mosque was expanded multiple times, with the expansion by al-Hakam II (r. 961–976) introducing important aesthetic innovations such as interlacing arches and ribbed domes, which were imitated and elaborated in later monuments in the region. The construction of Madinat al-Zahra, a new capital and monumental palace-city in the 10th century, also created an important complex of royal architecture and patronage. Smaller monuments such as the Bab al-Mardum Mosque in Toledo and the minarets added to the Qarawiyyin and Andalusiyyin mosques in Fez (present-day Morocco) demonstrate the prevalence of the same stylistic elements across the region.

After its initial apogee of power, the Abbasid Caliphate became partly fragmented into regional states in the 9th century which were formally obedient to the caliphs in Baghdad but were &quot;de facto&quot; independent. The Aghlabids in Ifriqiya (roughly modern-day Tunisia) were notable patrons of architecture themselves, responsible for rebuilding both the Great Mosque of Kairouan (originally founded by Uqba ibn Nafi in 670) and the Zaytuna Mosque of Tunis in much of their current forms, as well as for building numerous other structures in the region. In Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun established a short-lived dynasty, the Tulunids, and built himself a new capital (Al-Qata&#x27;i) and a new congregational mosque, known as the Ibn Tulun Mosque, which was completed in 879. It was strongly influenced by Abbasid architecture in Samarra and remains one of the most notable and best-preserved examples of 9th-century architecture from the Abbasid Caliphate.
In Iran and Central Asia, a number of other local and regional dynasties held sway prior to the arrival of the Seljuks in the 11th century. By the 10th century, central Iran and the Abbasid heartland of Iraq were under the &quot;de facto&quot; rule of the Buyid dynasty, northern Iran was ruled by the Bawandids and Ziyarids, and the northeastern regions of Khurasan and Transoxiana were ruled by the Samanids. It is around this period that many of the distinctive features of subsequent Iranian and Central Asian architecture first emerged, including the use of baked brick for both construction and decoration, the use of glazed tile for surface decoration, and the development of &quot;muqarnas&quot; from squinches. Hypostyle mosques continued to be built and there is also evidence of multi-domed mosques, though most were modified or rebuilt in later eras. The Jameh Mosque of Na&#x27;in, one of the oldest surviving congregational mosques in Iran, contains some of the best-preserved features from this period, including decorative brickwork, Kufic inscriptions, and rich stucco decoration featuring vine scrolls and acanthus leaves that draw from the earlier styles of Samarra. Another important architectural trend to arise in the 10th to 11th centuries is the development of mausolea, which took on monumental forms for the first time. One type of mausoleum was the tomb tower, such as the Gunbad-i-Qabus (circa 1006–7), while the other main type was the domed square, such as the Tomb of the Samanids in Bukhara (before 943).
In the 10th century, the Fatimid Caliphate rose to power in Ifriqiya, where it built a new fortified capital at Mahdia. In 970, the Fatimids moved their center of power to Egypt and founded another capital, Cairo. Fatimid architecture in Egypt followed Tulunid techniques and used similar materials, but also developed its own features. The first Fatimid congregational mosque in Cairo was al-Azhar Mosque, founded at the same time as the city (970), which became the spiritual center for the Ismaili Shi&#x27;a branch of Islam. Other notable monuments include the large Mosque of al-Hakim (founded in 990 under al-&#x27;Aziz but completed around 1013 under al-Hakim), the small Aqmar Mosque (1125) with its richly-decorated street façade, and the domed Mashhad of Sayyida Ruqayya (1133), notable for its &quot;mihrab&quot; of elaborately-carved stucco. Under the powerful vizier Badr al-Jamali (r. 1073–1094), the city walls were rebuilt in stone along with several monumental gates, three of which have survived to the present-day: Bab al-Futuh, Bab al-Nasr, and Bab Zuweila).

== Characteristics ==
=== Courtyards ===

In the architecture of the Muslim world courtyards are found in secular and religious structures.
# Residences and other secular buildings typically contain a central private courtyard or walled garden. This was also called the &quot;wast ad-dar&quot; (&quot;middle of the house&quot;) in Arabic. The tradition of courtyard houses was already widespread in the ancient Mediterranean world and Middle East, as seen in Greco-Roman houses (e.g. the Roman &quot;domus&quot;). The use of this space included the aesthetic effects of plants and water, the penetration of natural light, allowing breezes and air circulation into the structure during summer heat, as a cooler space with water and shade, and as a protected and proscribed place where the women of the house need not be covered in the hijab clothing traditionally necessary in public.

# A &quot;ṣaḥn&quot; () is the formal courtyard found in almost every mosque in Islamic architecture. The courtyards are open to the sky and surrounded on all sides by structures with halls and rooms, and often a shaded semi-open arcade &quot;riwaq&quot;. A mosque courtyard is used for performing ablutions and as a patio for rest or gathering. &quot;Sahn&quot;s usually feature a central pool or fountain to aid with ablutions, sometimes sheltered under an open domed pavilion. Historically, because of the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates, the courtyard also served to accommodate larger numbers of worshippers during Friday prayers.

=== Hypostyle hall ===
A hypostyle, i.e., an open hall supported by columns, is considered to be derived from architectural traditions of Achaemenid period Persian assembly halls (apadana). This type of building originated from the Roman-style basilica with an adjacent courtyard surrounded by colonnades, like Trajan&#x27;s Forum in Rome. The Roman type of building has developed out of the Greek agora. In Islamic architecture, the hypostyle hall is the main feature of the hypostyle mosque. One of the earliest hypostyle mosques is the Tarikhaneh Mosque in Iran, dating back to the eighth century.

Some scholars refer to the early hypostyle mosque with courtyard as the &quot;Arab plan&quot; or &quot;Arab-type&quot; mosque. Such mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of this type of plan limited the opportunities for further development, and as a result, these mosques gradually fell out of popularity in some regions.

=== Vaulting ===
In Islamic buildings, vaulting follows two distinct architectural styles: While Umayyad architecture in the west continues Syrian traditions of the sixth and seventh century, eastern Islamic architecture was mainly influenced by Sasanian styles and forms.

==== Umayyad diaphragm arches and barrel vaults ====
In their vaulting structures, Umayyad period buildings show a mixture of ancient Roman and Persian architectural traditions. Diaphragm arches with lintelled ceilings made of wood or stone beams, or, alternatively, with barrel vaults, were known in the Levant since the classical and Nabatean period. They were mainly used to cover houses and cisterns. The architectural form of covering diaphragm arches with barrel vaults, however, was likely newly introduced from Iranian architecture, as similar vaulting was not known in Bilad al-Sham before the arrival of the Umayyads. However, this form was well known in Iran from early Parthian times, as exemplified in the Parthian buildings of Aššur. The earliest known example for barrel vaults resting on diaphragm arches from Umayyad architecture is known from Qasr Harane in Syria. During the early period, the diaphragm arches are built from coarsely cut limestone slabs, without using supporting falsework, which were connected by gypsum mortar. Later-period vaults were erected using pre-formed lateral ribs modelled from gypsum, which served as a temporal formwork to guide and center the vault. These ribs, which were left in the structure afterwards, do not carry any load. The ribs were cast in advance on strips of cloth, the impression of which can still be seen in the ribs today. Similar structures are known from Sasanian architecture, for example from the palace of Firuzabad. Umayyad-period vaults of this type were found in Amman Citadel and in Qasr Amra.

==== Iwans ====

An iwan is a hall that is walled on three sides and open on one side. It is typically covered by a vault although this can vary. This feature was present in Sasanian architecture, though its exact origins are older and still debated. It was later incorporated into Islamic architecture. Its usage became more common and widespread under the Seljuks in the 10th century. Iwans were used in a variety of ways and arranged in varying positions in relation to the rest of the building. They are found in many types of buildings including mosques, madrasas, palaces, and caravanserais.
A common layout is the four-iwan plan.

The related Persian term, , means the entrance portal (sometimes an iwan) projecting from the façade of a building, often decorated with calligraphy bands, glazed tilework, and geometric designs.

=== Domes ===
==== Domes in Iran and Central Asia ====
Because of its long history of building and re-building, spanning the time from the Abbasids to the Qajar dynasty, and its excellent state of conservation, the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan provides an overview over the experiments Islamic architects conducted with complicated vaulting structures.

The system of squinches, which is a construction filling in the upper angles of a square room so as to form a base to receive an octagonal or spherical dome, was already known in Sasanian architecture. The spherical triangles of the squinches were split up into further subdivisions or systems of niches, resulting in a complex interplay of supporting structures forming an ornamental spatial pattern which hides the weight of the structure.

The tradition of double-shelled brick domes in Iran has been traced back to the 11th century. At the beginning of the 15th century, major Timurid monuments like the Gur-i Amir Mausoleum and the Bibi Khanum Mosque (both completed around 1404) were notable in their use of large double-shelled domes. These domes were composed of an inner shell which was visible from the interior and a larger outer shell, visible from the exterior and often of a slightly different shape. The Gur-i Amir Mausoleum&#x27;s dome, the oldest one to have survived to the present day, features an exterior ribbed profile with a band of muqarnas around its drum. However, domes of this shape and style were likely constructed earlier, as evidenced by the Sultaniyya Mausoleum in Cairo, which was built earlier in the 1350s and appears to have copied this same design from the Iranian tradition.

The &quot;non-radial rib vault&quot;, an architectural form of ribbed vaults with a superimposed spherical dome, is the characteristic architectural vault form of the Islamic East. From its beginnings in the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, this form of vault was used in a sequence of important buildings up to the period of Safavid architecture. Its main characteristics are:
* four intersecting ribs, at times redoubled and intersected to form an eight-pointed star;
* the omission of a transition zone between the vault and the supporting structure;
* a central dome or roof lantern on top of the ribbed vault.

While intersecting pairs of ribs from the main decorative feature of Seljuk architecture, the ribs were hidden behind additional architectural elements in later periods, as exemplified in the dome of the Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar in Merv, until they finally disappeared completely behind the double shell of a stucco dome, as seen in the dome of Ālī Qāpū in Isfahan.

==== Domes in South Asia ====

The use of domes in South Asia started with the establishment of Delhi sultanate in 1204 CE. Unlike Ottoman domes, and even more so than Persian domes, domes in South Asia tend to be more bulbous. Many monumental Mughal domes were also double-shelled and derived from the Iranian tradition. The design of the Tomb of Humayun (completed around 1571–72), including its double-shelled dome, suggests that its architects were familiar with Timurid monuments in Samarqand. The central dome of the Taj Mahal likewise features a bulbous profile and a double-shelled construction.

==== Ribbed domes in Al-Andalus and the Maghreb ====

The Great Mosque of Córdoba in Al-Andalus was initially built with a system of double-arched arcades supporting the flat timberwork ceiling. The columns of the arcades are connected by horseshoe arches which support brick pillars, which are in turn interconnected by semicircular arches. This arcade system was copied during the mosque&#x27;s subsequent expansions, but the expansion by al-Hakam II after 961 also introduced a series of ornate ribbed domes. Three domes span the vaults in front of the mihrab wall while another one covers an area now known by its Spanish name, the &quot;Capilla de Villaviciosa&quot;, located several bays before the mihrab. In sections which now supporting these domes, additional supporting structures were needed to bear the thrust of the cupolas. The architects solved this problem by the construction of intersecting arches. The domes themselves are built with eight intersecting stone ribs. Rather than meeting in the centre of the dome, the ribs intersect one another off-center, leaving the central space to be occupied by a smaller cupola. For the domes in front of the mihrab, the ribs form an eight-pointed star and an octagonal cupola in the centre. For the dome over the &quot;Capilla de Villaviciosa&quot;, the ribs leave a central square space between them, with an octagonal cupola added over this.

The ribbed domes of the Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba served as models for later mosque buildings in the Islamic West of Al-Andalus and the Maghreb. At around 1000 AD, the Bab al-Mardum Mosque in Toledo was constructed with a similar, eight-ribbed dome, surrounded by eight other ribbed domes of varying design. Similar domes are also seen in the mosque building of the Aljafería of Zaragoza. The architectural form of the ribbed dome was further developed in the Maghreb: the central dome of the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, a masterpiece of the Almoravids founded in 1082, has twelve slender ribs and the shell between the ribs is filled with filigree stucco work.

==== Ottoman domes ====

Ottoman architecture developed a specific form of monumental, representative building: large central domes were erected on top of a centrally-planned building. After the Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453, they found a variety of Byzantine Christian churches, the largest and most prominent being the Hagia Sophia. The brickwork-and-mortar ribs and the spherical shell of the central dome of the Hagia Sophia were built simultaneously, as a self-supporting structure without any wooden centring. In the early Byzantine church of Hagia Irene, the ribs of the dome vault are fully integrated into the shell, similar to Western Roman domes, and thus are not visible from within the building. In the dome of the Hagia Sophia, the ribs and shell of the dome unite in a central medallion at the apex of the dome, the upper ends of the ribs being integrated into the shell; shell and ribs form one single structural entity. The structural transition below the dome is achieved by four pendentives and the domed space is extended by two semi-domes. This design, along with early Ottoman designs, served as the model for subsequent development.

Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan attempted to solve the structural issues of the Hagia Sophia dome by constructing a system of centrally symmetric pillars with flanking semi-domes, as exemplified by the design of the Süleymaniye Mosque (four pillars with two flanking shield walls and two semi-domes, 1550–1557) and the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne (eight pillars with four diagonal semi-domes, 1568–1574). The design of the Selimiye Mosque, which came after many spatial and structural experiments in previous works, is Sinan&#x27;s masterpiece and the pinnacle of Ottoman domed architecture. It optimizes the domed space, making all elements of the building subordinate to it. Ottoman sources boasted that its dome surpassed that of the Hagia Sophia for the first time.

=== Gardens ===

Gardens and water have for many centuries played an essential role in Islamic culture, and are often compared to the garden of Paradise. The comparison originates from the Achaemenid Empire. In his dialogue &quot;Oeconomicus&quot;, Xenophon has Socrates relate the story of the Spartan general Lysander&#x27;s visit to the Persian prince Cyrus the Younger, who shows the Greek his &quot;Paradise at Sardis&quot;. The classical form of the Persian Paradise garden, or the &quot;charbagh&quot;, comprises a rectangular irrigated space with elevated pathways, which divide the garden into four sections of equal size:

One of the hallmarks of Persian gardens is the four-part garden laid out with axial paths that intersect at the garden&#x27;s centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful metaphor for the organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.

A Charbagh from Achaemenid time has been identified in the archaeological excavations at Pasargadae. The gardens of Chehel Sotoun (Isfahan), Fin Garden (Kashan), Eram Garden (Shiraz), Shazdeh Garden (Mahan), Dowlatabad Garden (Yazd), Abbasabad Garden (Abbasabad), Akbarieh Garden (South Khorasan Province), Pahlevanpour Garden, all in Iran, form part of the UNESCO World Heritage. Large Paradise gardens are also found at the Taj Mahal (Agra), and at Humayun&#x27;s Tomb (New Delhi), in India; the Shalimar Gardens (Lahore, Pakistan) or at the Alhambra and Generalife in Granada, Spain.

=== Ornamentation ===
As a common feature, Islamic architecture makes use of specific ornamental forms, including mathematically complicated, elaborate geometric patterns, floral motifs like the arabesque, and elaborate calligraphic inscriptions. The geometric or floral, interlaced forms, taken together, constitute an infinitely repeated pattern that extends beyond the visible material world. Figural motifs, such as animals, humans, and imaginary creatures, have a rich tradition in Islamic art, though they generally more stylized than naturalistic. However, because of the religious taboo on figural representations, non-figural decoration remained more dominant overall and figural motifs were generally excluded from religious buildings entirely.

The importance of the written word in Islam ensured that epigraphic or calligraphic decoration played a prominent role in architecture. Epigraphic decoration can also indicate further political or religious messages through the selection of a textual program of inscriptions. For example, the calligraphic inscriptions adorning the Dome of the Rock include quotations from the Qur&#x27;an that reference the miracle of Jesus and his human nature (e.g. Quran 19:33–35), the oneness of God (e.g. Qur&#x27;an 112), and the role of Muhammad as the &quot;Seal of the Prophets&quot;, which have been interpreted as an attempt to announce the rejection of the Christian concept of the Holy Trinity and to proclaim the triumph of Islam over Christianity and Judaism. Additionally, foundation inscriptions on buildings commonly indicate its founder or patron, the date of its construction, the name of the reigning sovereign, and other information.

These decorative motifs are expressed in a range of mediums, including stone carving, brickwork, carved stucco, tilework, paint, glass mosaics, marble or stone paneling, and stained glass windows. Capitals, the upper part or crowing feature of a column, serve as a transition piece and are often decoratively carved. They range greatly in design and shape in Islamic Architecture. Early Islamic buildings in Iran featured &quot;Persian&quot; type capitals which included designs of bulls heads, while Mediterranean structures displayed a more classical influence.

=== Muqarnas ===

&quot;Muqarnas&quot; is a three-dimensional sculpted motif created by the geometric subdivision of a vaulting structure into miniature, superimposed pointed-arch substructures or niches, also known as &quot;honeycomb&quot; or &quot;stalactite&quot; vaults. They can be made from different materials like stone, brick, wood or stucco. The earliest monuments to make use of this feature date from the 11th century and are found in Iraq, North Africa, Iran, Central Asia, and Upper Egypt. This apparently near-simultaneous development in distant regions of the Islamic world has led to multiple scholarly theories about their origin and spread, with one current theory proposing that they originated in one region at least a century earlier and then spread from there. Some of the earliest surviving examples preserved &quot;in situ&quot; are tripartite squinches used as transitional elements for domes and semi-domes, such as at the Arab-Ata Mausoleum (977–978) in Tim (Uzbekistan), the Gunbad-i Qabus (1006–1007) in northeastern Iran, and the Duvazdah Imam Mausoleum (1037–1038) in Yazd. From the 12th century onward its usage became common across the Islamic world and different local styles developed over time. In addition to serving as squinches and pendentives, muqarnas was also employed to decorate cornices, portals, mihrabs, windows, arches, and entire domes.

=== Balconies and screens ===
Balconies are a common feature of Islamic domestic architecture due to the warm climates in most countries. One of the mosque recognizable types is the &quot;mashrabiya&quot;, a wooden lattice screen which projects from the side of a building and which protected privacy by allowed those inside to look outside without being visible from outside. Another type of lattice screen, not restricted to balconies, is the &quot;jali&quot;, which is common to Indo-Islamic architecture and is made of perforated stone. Other examples of balconies and related structures include the &quot;jharokha&quot; in Rajasthani and Indo-Islamic architecture and the &quot;mirador&quot;, a Spanish term applied to a balcony or lookout pavilion in Andalusi palaces like the Alhambra. Balconies also became an architectural element inside some mosques, such as the &quot;hünkâr mahfili&quot; in Ottoman mosques, a separate and protected space where the sultan could perform his prayers (similar to a &quot;maqsura&quot;). A similar feature is also found in the Bara Gunbad complex (late 15th century) in Delhi.

=== Other elements of religious architecture ===

==== &quot;Qibla&quot; orientation ====

The &quot;qiblah&quot; () is the direction in which Mecca is from any given location, towards which Muslims face during prayers. Within Islamic architecture it is a major component of both the features and the orientation of the building itself. Mosques and religious structures are built to have one side aligned with this direction, usually marked by a visual feature called a &quot;mihrab&quot;. The layout of some Muslim cities may have also been influenced by this orientation. In practice, however, the &quot;qibla&quot; alignments of mosques built in different periods and locations do not all point to the same place. This is due to discrepancies in the calculations of the Islamic scientists in the past who determined where Mecca was from their individual locations. Scholars note that these differences come about for a multitude of reasons, such as some misunderstanding the meaning of &quot;qibla&quot; itself, the fact that the geographic coordinates of the past do not line up with the coordinates of today, and that the determination of this direction was more an astronomical calculation, rather than a mathematical one. Early mosques were constructed according to either the calculations of what direction &quot;qibla&quot; was approximately, or with the &quot;mihrab&quot; facing south, as that was the direction that Muhammad was facing when he prayed in Medina, which is a city directly north of Mecca.

==== &quot;Mihrab&quot; ====

The mihrab is a niche or alcove, typically concave, set into the &quot;qibla&quot; wall (the wall standing in the direction of prayer) of a mosque or other prayer space. It symbolized and indicated the direction of the &quot;qibla&quot; to worshippers. It also acquired ritual and ceremonial importance over time, and its shape was even used as a symbol on some coinage. The very first mosques did not have mihrabs; the first known concave mihrab niche was the one added to the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina by Caliph al-Walid I in 706 or 707. In later mosques the &quot;mihrab&quot; evolved to become the usual focus of architectural decoration in the building. The details of its shape and materials varied from region to region. In congregational mosques, the mihrab was usually flanked by a &quot;minbar&quot; (pulpit), and some historical mosques also included a nearby &quot;maqsura&quot; (a protected space for the ruler during prayers).

==== Minaret ====

The minaret is a tower that traditionally accompanies a mosque building. Its formal function is to provide a vantage point from which the call to prayer, or &quot;&quot;, is made. The call to prayer is issued five times each day: dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and night. In most modern mosques, the is made directly from the prayer hall and broadcast via microphone to a speaker system on the minaret.

The origin of the minaret and its initial functions are not clearly known and have long been a topic of scholarly discussion. The earliest mosques lacked minarets, and the call to prayer was often performed from smaller tower structures. The early Muslim community of Medina gave the call to prayer from the doorway or the roof of the house of Muhammad, which doubled as a place for prayer. The first confirmed minarets in the form of towers date from the early 9th century under Abbasid rule and they did not become a standard feature of mosques until the 11th century. These first minaret towers were placed in the middle of the wall opposite the qibla wall. Among them, the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, dating from 836, is one of the oldest surviving minarets in the world and the oldest in North Africa. It has the shape of a massive tower with a square base, three levels of decreasing widths, and a total height of 31.5 meters.

Minarets have had various forms (in general round, squared, spiral or octagonal) depending on the period and architectural tradition. The number of minarets by mosques is not fixed; originally one minaret would accompany each mosque, but some architectural styles can include multiple minarets.
== Towns and cities ==
=== Early Muslim garrison towns ===
In the newly-conquered areas of the early Muslim expansion, military settlements were often founded, known individually as a &quot;misr&quot; (, pl. ). This policy continued up to the Umayyad period. Like frontier colonies, these towns served as bases for further conquests. Initially, they appear to have been modest settlements consisting of an agglomeration of tents, perhaps similar to ancient Roman legionary camps. They were established outside existing non-Muslim cities. They were often unfortified and the residents were organized according to tribal origins. Rather than maintaining their original purpose to serve as a military base, many developed into urbanized administrative and commercial centers. In particular, this happened in the case of the Iraqi cities of Kufa and Basra (which became known as , &quot;the two forts&quot;), as well as Fustat and Kairouan in North Africa. Basic facilities like a mosque, a governor&#x27;s residence (), and a market were likely the first major constructions to appear, located at the center of the town.

=== Transformation of conquered towns ===
More often than founding new cities, the new Islamic rulers took over existing towns. Most of the new Arab settlers nonetheless settled into previously existing urban centers throughout the conquered territories. These cities were transformed according to the needs of the new Islamic society and Islamic facilities were inserted into the existing urban fabric after the conquest. In the case of Damascus and Aleppo, for example, the cities were largely of Roman-Byzantine heritage and their topography changed slowly. The Islamic presence was signaled at first only by the presence of a mosque (and, in Damascus, the royal palace). This transformation, which resulted in what is often regarded as the traditional &quot;Islamic&quot; city, occurred over a long period and was shaped by multiple social and economic causes that varied according to region and period. The arrival of Islamic rule was only one stage in a process that had already begun by the 6th century.

The principle of arranging buildings is known as &quot;horizontal spread&quot;. Residencies and public buildings as well as private housing tend to be laid out separately, and are not directly related to each other architectonically. Archaeological excavations at the city of Jerash, the Gerasa of Antiquity, have revealed how the Umayyads have transformed the city plan.

=== Experiments with ideal city models ===
The antique concept of the architecture of a metropolis is based on a structure of main and smaller roads running through the entire city, and dividing it into quarters. The streets are oriented towards public buildings like a palace, temple, or a public square. Two main roads, (&quot;cardo&quot; and &quot;decumanus&quot;) cross each other at right angles in the center of the city. A few cities were founded during the early Islamic Umayyad Caliphate, the outlines of which were based on the Ancient Roman concept of the ideal city. An example of a city planned according to such concepts was excavated at Anjar in Lebanon. Donald Whitcomb argues that the early Muslim conquests initiated a conscious attempt to recreate specific morphological features characteristic of earlier western and southwestern Arabian cities.

The Arab elite of the early Islam were city dwellers of Mecca, Medina, Ta&#x27;if and the highly urbanized society of Yemen whose Arabian traditions contributed to the urban development of the early Islamic cities. Outside Arabia, the early military encampments of Kufa, Basra, Fustat, and Kairouan were rapidly transformed into permanent foundations and planned cities. One of the traditions contributing to the early Islamic city was the south Arabian city, such as Sana’a, to which type Mecca and Fustat belonged. Two urban types based on social organization have been proposed by Walter Dostal. The first is called the San&#x27;a-formation, developed from a market center and inhabited by groups of the same tribe with social differentiation based on his &quot;farmer-craftsman&quot; technological specializations. The second urban type is the Tarim-formation, in which quarter organization reflects the social structure of a multi-tribal settlement.

=== Urban morphology ===
The architecture of the &quot;oriental&quot; Islamic town is based on cultural and sociological concepts which differ from those of European cities. In both cultures, a distinction is made between the areas used by the rulers and their government and administration, public places of everyday common life, and the areas of private life. While the structures and concepts of European towns originated from a sociological struggle to gain basic rights of freedom—or town privileges—from political or religious authorities during the Middle Ages, an Islamic town or city is fundamentally influenced by the preservation of the unity of secular and religious life throughout time.

In a Muslim city, palaces and residences as well as public places like charitable or religious complexes (mosques, madrasas, and hospitals) and private living spaces rather coexist alongside each other. The buildings tend to be more inwardly oriented, and are separated from the surrounding &quot;outside&quot; either by walls or by the hierarchical ordering of the streets, or both. Streets tend to lead from public main roads to cul-de-sac byroads and onwards into more private plots, and then end there. There are no, or very few, internal connections between different quarters of the city. In order to move from one quarter to the next, one has to go back to the main road again.

Within a city quarter, byroads lead towards individual building complexes or clusters of houses. The individual house is frequently also oriented towards an inner atrium, and enclosed by walls, which mostly are unadorned, unlike European outward-oriented, representative façades. Thus, the spatial structure of a Muslim city essentially reflects the ancient nomadic tradition of living in a family group or tribe, held together by &quot;asabiyyah&quot; (&quot;bond of cohesion&quot;, or &quot;family loyalty&quot;), strictly separated from the &quot;outside&quot;. In general, the morphology of an Islamic city is granting—or denying—access according to the basic concept of hierarchical degrees of privacy. The inhabitants move from public space to the living quarters of their tribe, and onwards to their family home. Within a family house, there are again to be found common and separate spaces, the latter, and most private, usually reserved for women and children. In the end, only the family heads have free and unlimited access to all rooms and areas of their private home, as opposed to the more European concept of interconnecting different spaces for free and easy access. The hierarchy of privacy thus guides and structures the entire social life in a city, from the ruler to the commoner, from the town to the house.

== Influences ==

=== Greco-Roman and Sasanian influences ===
Early Islamic architecture was influenced by two different ancient traditions:
# Greco-Roman tradition: In particular, the regions of the newly conquered Byzantine Empire (Southwestern Anatolia, Syria, Egypt and the Maghreb) supplied architects, masons, mosaicists and other craftsmen to the new Islamic rulers. These artisans were trained in Byzantine architecture and decorative arts, and continued building and decorating in Byzantine style, which had developed out of Hellenistic and ancient Roman architecture.
# Eastern tradition: Mesopotamia and Persia, despite adopting elements of Hellenistic and Roman representative style, retained their independent architectural traditions, which derived from Sasanian architecture and its predecessors.

The transition process between late Antiquity, or post-classical, and Islamic architecture is exemplified by archaeologic findings in North Syria and Palestine, the Bilad al-Sham (Levant region) of the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates. In this region, late antique, or Christian, architectural traditions merged with the pre-Islamic Arabian heritage of the conquerors.

=== Arabian ===
References on Islamic architecture generally agree that pre-Islamic architecture in the Arabian Peninsula had only limited influence on the development of Islamic architecture, at least by comparison with the influences of existing architectural traditions in the conquered territories beyond the peninsula. In western scholarship, a traditional assumption was that the Arabs of the early 7th century, at the time of Muhammad, were nomadic pastoralists who did not have strong architectural traditions. Thanks to more recent studies and archeological investigations, this view has since been revised and is now considered obsolete. According to scholar Beatrice Saint Laurent, early academic investigations into the history of Islamic monumental architecture led to the &quot;flawed view that saw the roots of an Early Islamic monumental architecture and art solely in the traditions of the conquered regions&quot;. Scholars now agree that a rich architectural tradition also preceded the appearance of Islam in Arabia and the first Islamic monuments.

The major architectural contribution that took place in Arabia during the early Islamic period was the development of a distinctive Muslim mosque. The hypostyle mosque constructed by Muhammad in Medina served as a model for early mosque design throughout the Islamic world. Umayyad religious architecture was the earliest expression of Islamic art on a grand scale and the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus reproduced the hypostyle model at a monumental scale. Moreover, the Umayyads did not come from a cultural void and were aware of their own Arabian cultural history. Some scholars suggest they sought to continue the pre-Islamic Arabian architectural tradition of building tall palaces to symbolize the ruler&#x27;s power.

== Regional styles (after the 10th century) ==

===Iran and Central Asia===

Starting in the 10th century and especially during the period of Seljuk domination, the eastern Islamic world – including Iran and Central Asia – generally shared a common architectural style. This style was characterized by the prominent use of brick as both construction material and decoration, extensive arcades, glazed tile decoration on the outside of buildings, the privileged use of domes and vaulting, and the increasing use of &quot;muqarnas&quot;.

Turkic peoples began moving into the Middle East from the 8th century onward and, after converting to Islam, became major political and military forces in the region. The first major Turkic dynasty was the Ghaznavids, who ruled from Ghazna in present-day Afghanistan and adopted a Persianate culture. In the second half of the 12th century the Ghurids, of uncertain ethnic origin, replaced them as the major power in the region from northern India to the edge of the Caspian Sea. Among the most remarkable monuments of these two dynasties are a number of ornate brick towers and minarets that have survived as stand-alone structures and whose exact functions are unclear. They include the Tower of Mas&#x27;ud III near Ghazna (early 12th century) and the Minaret of Jam built by the Ghurids (late 12th century). Around the same time, between the late 10th century and the early 13th century, the Turkic Qarakhanids ruled in Transoxiana. This period is regarded as a &quot;classical&quot; age of Central Asian architecture, with many constructions taking place in Bukhara and Samarkand.
More significant was the arrival of the Seljuk Turks and the formation of the Great Seljuk Empire in the 11th century, which conquered all of Iran and other extensive territories in Central Asia and the Middle East. The most important religious monument from the Great Seljuk period is the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, which was expanded and modified by various Seljuk patrons in the late 11th century and early 12th century. Two major and innovative domed chambers were added to it in the late 11th century. Four large iwans were then erected around the courtyard around the early 12th century, giving rise to the four-iwan plan. The four-iwan plan revolutionised the form and function of the mosques in the region and introduced new types of buildings involving madrasas and caravanserais which spread through Iran, Anatolia, and Syria.
Iran and Central Asia were conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century, which led to the establishment of the Ilkhanate. The Ilkhanate period provided several innovations to dome-building that eventually enabled the Persians to construct much taller structures. These changes later paved the way for Safavid architecture. The pinnacle of Ilkhanate architecture was reached with the construction of Uljaytu&#x27;s mausoleum (1302–1312) in Soltaniyeh, Iran, which measures 50 m in height and 25 m in diameter, making it the 3rd largest and the tallest masonry dome ever erected. The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.Iranian architecture and city planning also reached an apogee under the Timurids, the dynasty founded by Timur (). Timurid architecture is marked by its grand scale, prominent double-shelled domes, extensive use of ceramic tiles on the outside, and elaborate geometric vaulting on the inside. It drew on the previous developments of Ilkhanid architecture and refined them, developing an imperial style that was influential beyond its original borders, such as in the early Ottoman Empire to the west and the Mughal Empire on the Indian subcontinent. The monuments erected by Timur and his successors are found across the region but concentrated especially in Samarkand and Herat, the main capitals.

The renaissance in Persian mosque and dome building came during the Safavid dynasty, when Shah Abbas, in 1598 initiated the reconstruction of Isfahan, with the Naqsh-e Jahan Square as the centerpiece of his new capital. The distinct feature of Persian domes, which separates them from those domes created in the Christian world or the Ottoman and Mughal empires, was the colorful tiles, with which they covered the exterior of their domes, as they would on the interior. These domes soon numbered dozens in Isfahan, and the distinct, blue-colored shape came to dominate the skyline of the city. This distinct style of architecture was perfected during the Safavid period, which saw the advent of the &quot;haft-rangi&quot;, or seven-colour style of tile burning, a process that enabled them to apply more colours to each tile, creating richer patterns, sweeter to the eye. The colours that the Persians favoured were golden, white and turquoise patterns on a dark- blue background. The extensive inscription bands of calligraphy and arabesque on most of the major buildings where carefully planned and executed by Ali Reza Abbasi, who was appointed head of the royal library and Master calligrapher at the Shah&#x27;s court in 1598, while Shaykh Bahai oversaw the construction projects. Reaching 53 meters in height, the dome of the Shah Mosque would become the tallest in the city when it was finished in 1629. It was built as a double-shelled dome, with 14 m spanning between the two layers, and resting on an octagonal dome chamber.

=== Post-Seljuk Syria and Mesopotamia ===

As the Seljuk Empire began to break up in the 12th century, various Seljuk elites established autonomous local dynasties throughout the Middle East, particularly in the western half of the empire, which included Iraq and Syria. Under Zengid and Artuqid rule, cities like Mosul, Diyarbakir, Hasankeyf, and Mardin in Upper Mesopotamia (or in Arabic) became important centers of architectural development that had a long-term influence in the wider region. One of the most notable monuments is the Great Mosque of Diyarbakir, founded in the 7th century but rebuilt under the Seljuks and the Artuqids in the 12th century. It is similar in form to the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus and has ornate Classical-like elements on its courtyard façade. The city walls of Diyarbakir also feature several towers built by the Artuqids and decorated with a mix of calligraphic inscriptions and figurative images of animals and mythological creatures carved in stone. One of the culminations of later Artuqid architecture is the Zinciriye or Sultan Isa Madrasa in Mardin, dating from 1385. In Mosul, the Zengid ruler Nur al-Din Zengi built the al-Nuri Mosque (1148 and 1170–1172), of which only the original minaret was preserved up to modern times. (The minaret and the rebuilt mosque were recently destroyed in the Battle of Mosul.)

Zengid rule helped to spread architectural forms from the eastern Islamic world to the region of Syria. Damascus regained some prominence after it came under Nur al-Din&#x27;s control in 1154. That same year, Nur al-Din founded a hospital complex, the Maristan al-Nuri or Bimaristan of Nur al-Din, which was highly influential in the Islamic world and is notable for the muqarnas vaulting of its entrance portal and a muqarnas dome of Mesopotamian influence over the vestibule. The Zengids and their successors, the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty, built many more madrasas, fortifications, hammams, and other charitable buildings in the cities of Syria. Unlike Seljuk and Iranian madrasas, the Syrian madrasas are smaller and more diverse in their layouts, adapted to the dense urban fabric of cities like Damascus and Aleppo (e.g. Adiliya Madrasa in Damascus and Firdaws Madrasa in Aleppo).

=== Anatolian Seljuks and Beyliks ===
The Anatolian Seljuks ruled a territory that was multi-ethnic and only newly settled by Muslims. As a result, their architecture was eclectic and incorporated influences from other cultures such as Iranian, Armenian, and local Byzantine architecture. In contrast with Seljuk constructions further east, Anatolian architecture was largely built of stone. The golden age of their Anatolian empire, with its capital at Konya, was in the early 13th century. Seljuk authority declined after their defeat by the Mongols in 1243. The Mongol Ilkhanids then ruled eastern Anatolia indirectly through Seljuk vassals until 1308, when they took direct control. Smaller principalities and local emirates, known collectively as the Beyliks, progressively emerged. Despite this decline, the Seljuk tradition of architecture largely persisted and continued to evolve under these new rulers.

Decoration in Anatolian Seljuk architecture was concentrated on entrance portals, windows, and mihrabs. Stone-carving was one of the most accomplished techniques, with motifs ranging from earlier Iranian stucco motifs to local Byzantine and Armenian motifs. The madrasas of Sivas and the Ince Minareli Medrese (c. 1265) in Konya are among the most notable examples, while the Great Mosque and Hospital complex of Divriği is distinguished by some of the most eclectic and extravagant stone-carving in the region. Syrian-style &quot;ablaq&quot; striped marble also appears on some entrance portals in Konya. Anatolian architecture innovated further in the use of tile revetments to cover entire surfaces independently of other forms of decoration, as seen in the Karatay Medrese (1251–1252) in Konya and evidenced by the mosaic tiles recovered from the Kubadabad Palace (c. 1236 or early 13th century).

Anatolian Seljuk mosques included more conservative hypostyle constructions alongside less traditional floor plans. An important hypostyle example is the Alaeddin Mosque of Konya (built between 1156 and 1235, with later additions). Mosques in the later Beylik period were more diverse in form, such as the Saruhanid congregational mosque in Manisa (1371), the Isa Bey Mosque in Selçuk (1374), and the İlyas Bey Mosque in Miletus (1304). Madrasas were typically centered around either a traditional open courtyard bordered by a varying number of iwans (e.g. Çifte Minareli Medrese in Erzurum and the Gök Medrese in Sivas) or a central court covered by a dome (e.g. the Karatay and Ince Minareli madrasas in Konya). Monumental caravanserais were also built along trade routes, typically with a fortified exterior appearance, a tall entrance portal decorated with carved stone, and an interior courtyard that sometimes contained a cubic prayer room elevated in the center (e.g. the Sultan Han southwest of Aksaray and another Sultan Han northeast of Kayseri).

=== Mamluk ===

The Mamluks were a military corps recruited from slaves that served under the Ayyubid dynasty and eventually took over from that dynasty in 1250, ruling over Egypt, the Levant, and the Hijaz until the Ottoman conquest of 1517. Despite their often tumultuous and violent internal politics, the Mamluk sultans were prolific patrons of architecture and contributed enormously to the repertoire of monuments in historic Cairo, their capital. Some long-reigning sultans, such as Al-Nasir Muhammad (, with interruptions) and Qaytbay (), were especially prolific. While Cairo was the main center of patronage, Mamluk architecture also appears in other cities of their realm such as Damascus, Jerusalem, Aleppo, and Medina.

Mamluk architecture is distinguished in part by the construction of multi-functional buildings whose floor plans became increasingly creative and complex due to the limited available space in the city and the desire to make monuments visually dominant in their urban surroundings. Patrons, including sultans and high-ranking emirs, typically set out to build mausoleums for themselves but attached to them various charitable structures such as madrasas, khanqahs, sabils, or mosques. The cruciform or four-iwan floor plan was adopted for madrasas and became more common for new monumental complexes than the traditional hypostyle mosque, although the vaulted iwans of the early period were replaced with flat-roofed iwans in the later period. The decoration of monuments also became more elaborate over time, with stone-carving and colored marble paneling and mosaics (including &quot;ablaq&quot;) replacing stucco as the most dominant architectural decoration. Monumental decorated entrance portals became common compared to earlier periods, often carved with &quot;muqarnas&quot;. Influences from the Syrian region, Ilkhanid Iran, and possibly even Venice were evident in these trends. Minarets, which were also elaborate, usually consisted of three tiers separated by balconies, with each tier having a different design than the others. Domes also transitioned from wooden or brick structures, sometimes of bulbous shape, to pointed stone domes with complex geometric or arabesque motifs carved into their outer surfaces. The peak of this stone dome architecture was achieved under the reign of Qaytbay in the late 15th century.

After the Ottoman conquest of 1517, new Ottoman-style buildings were introduced, however the Mamluk style continued to be repeated or combined with Ottoman elements in many subsequent monuments. Some building types from the late Mamluk period, such as sabil-kuttabs (a combination of sabil and &quot;kuttab&quot;) and multi-storied caravanserais (&quot;wikala&quot;s or &quot;khan&quot;s), actually grew in number during the Ottoman period. In modern times, from the late 19th century onwards, a Neo-Mamluk style was also used, partly as a nationalist response against Ottoman and European styles, in an effort to promote local &quot;Egyptian&quot; styles (though the architects were sometimes Europeans). Examples of this style are the Museum of Islamic Arts in Cairo, the Al-Rifa&#x27;i Mosque, the Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Alexandria, and numerous private and public buildings such as those of Heliopolis.

=== Ottoman ===

The architecture of the Ottoman Empire developed from earlier Seljuk architecture, with influences from Byzantine and Iranian architecture along with architectural traditions of the Balkans and other parts of Middle East. The classical architecture of the Ottoman Empire was a mixture of native Turkish tradition and influences from Hagia Sophia. One of the best representatives of this period is Mimar Sinan, whose works include the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul and the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne.

Beginning in the 18th century, Ottoman architecture was influenced by the Baroque architecture in Western Europe. Nuruosmaniye Mosque is one of the surviving examples from this period. The last Ottoman period saw more influences from Western Europe, brought in by architects such those from the Balyan family. This period also saw the development of a new architectural style called neo-Ottoman or Ottoman revivalism, also known as the First National Architectural Movement, by architects such as Mimar Kemaleddin and Vedat Tek.

While Istanbul was the main site of imperial patronage for most of the empire&#x27;s history, the early capitals of Bursa and Edirne also contain a concentration of Ottoman monuments. Ottoman architecture is also found across the empire&#x27;s provinces, ranging from Eastern Europe to the Middle East to North Africa. Major religious monuments, such as those sponsored by sultan and his family, were typically architectural complexes, known as a &quot;külliye&quot;, which had multiple elements providing various charitable services. These complexes were governed and managed with the help of a &quot;vakif&quot; agreement (Arabic &quot;waqf&quot;). For example, the Fatih Mosque in Istanbul was part of a very large &quot;külliye&quot; founded by Mehmed II, built between 1463 and 1470, which also included: a &quot;tabhane&quot; (guesthouse for travelers), an &quot;imaret&quot; (charitable kitchen), a &quot;darüşşifa&quot; (hospital), a caravanserai, a &quot;mektep&quot; (primary school), a library, a hammam (bathhouse), a cemetery with the founder&#x27;s mausoleum, and eight madrasas along with their annexes. The buildings were arranged in a regular, partly symmetrical layout with the monumental mosque at its center, although not all the structures have survived to the present day.
=== Iberian Peninsula and western North Africa ===

The architectural style which developed in the westernmost territories of the historic Muslim world is often referred to as &quot;Moorish architecture&quot;, though scholars often refer to it as &quot;Western Islamic architecture&quot; or &quot;architecture of the Islamic west&quot;. This architectural style developed primarily in al-Andalus (present-day Spain and Portugal) and in the Maghreb (mostly present-day Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia). Its most recognizable features include the horseshoe arch, &quot;riad&quot; gardens (symmetrically divided courtyard gardens), and elaborate geometric and arabesque motifs in wood, stucco, and tilework (notably &quot;zellij&quot;). Major centers of this artistic development included the main capitals of the empires and Muslim states in the region&#x27;s history, such as Cordoba, Kairouan, Fes, Marrakesh, Seville, Granada and Tlemcen. Among the best-known monuments from these areas are the Great Mosque of Kairouan, the Great Mosque of Cordoba, the palace-city of Madinat al-Zahra (near Cordoba), the Qarawiyyin Mosque (in Fes), the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, the Kutubiyya Mosque (Marrakesh), the Giralda tower (Seville), and the fortified palace-complex of the Alhambra (Granada).

Even after the Christian conquests of Al-Andalus the legacy of Moorish architecture was still carried on in the Mudéjar style in Spain, which made use of Moorish techniques and designs and adapted them to Christian patrons. In North Africa, the medieval Moorish style was perpetuated in Moroccan architecture with relatively few changes, while in Algeria and Tunisia it became blended with Ottoman architecture after the Ottoman conquest of the region in the 16th century. Much later, particularly in the 19th century, the Moorish style was frequently imitated or emulated in the Neo-Moorish or Moorish Revival style which emerged in Europe and America as part of the Romanticist interest in the &quot;Orient&quot; and also, notably, as a recurring choice for new Jewish Synagogue architecture.

In addition to the general Moorish style, some styles and structures in North Africa are distinctively associated with areas that have maintained strong Berber populations and cultures, including but not limited to the Atlas Mountain regions of Morocco, the Aurès and M&#x27;zab regions of Algeria, and southern Tunisia. They do not form one single style but rather a diverse variety of local vernacular styles. In Morocco, the largely Berber-inhabited rural valleys and oases of the Atlas and the south are marked by numerous kasbahs (fortresses) and &quot;ksour&quot; (fortified villages), typically flat-roofed structures made of rammed earth and decorated with local geometric motifs, as with the famous example of Ait Benhaddou. Likewise, southern Tunisia is dotted with hilltop &quot;ksour&quot; and multi-story fortified granaries (&quot;ghorfa&quot;), such as the examples in Medenine and Ksar Ouled Soltane, typically built with loose stone bound by a mortar of clay. The island of Jerba in Tunisia has a traditional mosque architecture featuring low-lying structures built in stone and covered in whitewash. Their prayer halls are domed and they have short, round minarets. The M&#x27;zab region of Algeria (e.g. Ghardaïa) also has distinctive mosques and houses that are completely whitewashed, but built in rammed earth. Its structures also make frequent use of domes and barrel vaults. Unlike Jerba, the distinctive minarets here are tall and have a square base, tapering towards the end and crowned with &quot;horn&quot;-like corners.

=== Yemeni ===

Yemeni architecture can be characterized as &quot;conservative&quot;, as it combines both pre-Islamic and Islamic features. In Antiquity, Yemen was home to several wealthy city-states and an indigenous tradition of South Arabian architecture. By the 5th century AD, there is evidence that the indigenous styles were being influenced by Byzantine and Late Antique Mediterranean art. Yemen was Islamized in the 7th century, but few buildings from the early Islamic period have been preserved intact today. It is only from the 10th century onward that distinctive Islamic architectural styles can be documented. 
One type of mosque attested during the early period of Sulayhid and Rasulid rule consisted of a large cubic chamber with one entrance, which had antecedents in the pre-Islamic temple architecture of the region. Another type consisted of a rectangular chamber with a transverse orientation, with multiple entrances and supporting columns inside, sometimes preceded by a courtyard. The hypostyle mosque with courtyard, common elsewhere, was comparatively rare in early Islamic Yemen. The Great Mosque of Sanaa, originally commissioned by the Umayyad caliph al-Walid (r. 705–15) and reconstructed at later times, was one of the few mosques of this type in the region. The mosque&#x27;s decoration reflects Yemeni techniques of carved and painted wood, carved stone, and carved stucco.

The Ayyubids introduced domed mosque types as well as Sunni-syle madrasas to the region, but none of their buildings in Yemen have survived. The Rasulids who followed them (13th–15th centuries) were prolific patrons of architecture and perpetuated these new building types, influenced by their political links with Egypt. During the same period, the Zaydi imams in northern Yemen were buried in richly-decorated domed tombs. With the advent of Ottoman rule in Yemen after 1538, Rasulid-style architecture continued to be the local norm in Sunni-controlled areas, but elements of Ottoman architecture began to be introduced in the late 16th century.
Yemen is also notable for its historic tower-houses, built on two or more floors. These houses vary in form and materials from region to region. They are typically built of mud (rammed earth or sun-dried mud-brick), stone, or a combination of both, with timber used for roofs and floors. While these structures are repaired and restored over time, this architectural style has remained generally unchanged for hundreds of years. The old city of Sanaa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site today, contains many examples. Some villages and towns, such as Rada&#x27;a, were built around a fortified citadel (e.g. the Citadel of Rada&#x27;a), others were encircled by a high mud-brick wall (e.g. Shibam), and some were built so that the houses themselves formed an outer wall along the perimeter (e.g. Khawlan).

=== Indian subcontinent ===
Indo-Islamic architecture on the Indian subcontinent began in Sindh in the 8th century, where remains of a congregational mosque at Banbhore dating to 725 have been uncovered. The Ghurids laid the foundations of the Delhi Sultanate and built monuments in northern India in the 12th and 13th centuries. The most notable monument of this period is the Quwwat al-Islam Mosque complex and the Qutb Minar, which were begun in the 1190s by Sultan Qutb al-Din Aybak. The mosque&#x27;s initial construction reused spolia from Hindu and Jain temples and the complex became a prototype for many mosques built in the region afterwards. The progress of Islamization in the region during the 14th and 15th centuries resulted in the emergence of a more distinctive Indo-Islamic style around this time, as exemplified by the monuments built under the Tughluq dynasty and other local states. Among other features, this style made increased use of arches, vaulted spaces, domes, and water features, while also integrating them with indigenous Indian architectural elements. In the northwestern part of the subcontinent, some notable examples from this period include the Tomb of Rukn-i Alam in Multan and the congregational mosque of Ahmedabad (1423), the latter of which is a particularly harmonious example of Islamic and indigenous Indian elements combined in one building.

The best known style of Indo-Islamic architecture is Mughal architecture, mostly built between about 1560 and 1720. Early Mughal architecture developed from existing Indo-Islamic architecture but also followed the model of Timurid architecture, due in part to the Timurid ancestry of the Mughal dynasty&#x27;s founder, Babur. Mughal architecture&#x27;s most prominent examples are the series of imperial mausolea, which started with the pivotal Tomb of Humayun. The most famous is the Taj Mahal in Agra, completed in 1648 by emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died while giving birth to their 14th child. The Taj Mahal is completely symmetrical except for Shah Jahan&#x27;s sarcophagus, which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in black marble to complement the Mecca-facing mosque placed to the west of the main structure. Another slightly later imperial mausoleum is the Bibi Ka Maqbara in Aurangabad (1678) which was commissioned by the sixth Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, in memory of his wife.

The Mughals also built monumental palaces and mosques. A famous example of the charbagh style of Mughal garden is the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, where the domeless Tomb of Jahangir is also located. The Red Fort in Delhi and the Agra Fort are huge castle-like fortified palaces, and the abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri, 26 miles (42 km) west of Agra, was built for Akbar in the late 16th century. Major mosques built by Mughal emperors and their family include the Jama Masjid (Friday Mosque) in Delhi, the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, and other mosques of similar form which were often built near or within other imperial complexes. Even the Mughal nobility were able to build relatively major monuments, as with the example of the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore (1635), built by Wazir Khan when he was governor of the Punjab under Shah Jahan. In the later Mughal period some local governors became semi-autonomous, prompting them to build their own monuments and embellish their own regional capitals with highly-creative local styles of architecture. The Bara Imambara complex () built by Asaf al-Dawla in Lucknow is an example of this.

The Deccan sultanates in the southern regions of the Indian subcontinent also developed their local Indo-Islamic Deccani architectural styles, exemplified by monuments such as the Charminar in Hyderabad (1591) and Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur (1656). In the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, the Bengali region developed a distinct regional style under the independent Bengal Sultanate, which flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. It incorporated influences from Persia, Byzantium and North India, which were with blended indigenous Bengali elements, such as curved roofs, corner towers and complex terracotta ornamentation. One feature in the sultanate was the relative absence of minarets. Many small and medium-sized medieval mosques, with multiple domes and artistic niche mihrabs, were constructed throughout the region. The grand mosque of Bengal was the Adina Mosque (1374–75), the largest mosque in the Indian subcontinent, though partially ruined today. Built of stone demolished from temples, it featured a monumental ribbed barrel vault over the central nave, the first such giant vault used anywhere in the subcontinent. The mosque was modeled on the imperial Sasanian style of Persia. Another exceptional example which survives in present-day Bangladesh is the Sat Gumbaz (&quot;Sixty-Dome&quot;) Mosque in Bagerhat (). Later, a provincial style influenced by North India evolved in Mughal Bengal during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Mughals also copied the Bengali &quot;do-chala&quot; roof tradition for mausoleums in North India.

=== Malay-Indonesian ===

Islam spread gradually in the Malay Peninsula and the surrounding Indonesian archipelago from the 12th century onwards, and especially during the 15th century as the Sultanate of Malacca and its surrounding cultural sphere politically dominated the region. The introduction of Islam was slow and gradual. The advent of Islam did not lead to the introduction of a new building tradition but saw the appropriation of existing architectural forms, which were reinterpreted to suit Muslim requirements. Existing architectural features in Malay-Indonesia such as the candi bentar gate, paduraksa (normally marks the entrance to the most sacred precincts), balai nobat (a tower supposedly used to store royal musical instruments) and the sacred pyramidal roof was used for Islamic architecture. Prayer times are often signalled in advance by striking a large drum known as beduk, thus minarets weren&#x27;t of need to these mosques let alone domes which multi-layered pyramidal roofs. One rare example of an old mosque with a minaret is that of the Menara Kudus Mosque.

Malay-Indonesian mosque architecture also features strong influence from the Middle Eastern architecture styles. This style of architecture can be found on the design of mosques in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. Today, with increasing Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Malay-Indonesian mosques are developing a more standard, international style, with a dome and minaret.

==== Indonesia ====

The oldest surviving mosque in Indonesia is the Great Mosque of Demak which is the royal mosque of the Sultanate of Demak, although this is not the oldest Islamic structure. The oldest Islamic structure in Indonesia are parts of the royal palace in Sultanate of Cirebon, Cirebon. The palace complex contains a chronogram which can be read as the Saka equivalent of 1454 CE. Early Islamic palaces retain many features of pre-Islamic architecture which is apparent in the gates or drum towers. The Kasepuhan Palace was probably begun in the late pre-Islamic period and continued to grow during the Hinduism-to-Islam transitional period. The complex contains clues to the stages of the process of the gradual changes as Islam become incorporated into Indonesian architecture. Two of the Hindu features adopted into Islam in the palace is the two types of gateways - the split portal (&quot;candi bentar&quot;) which provides access to the public audience pavilion and the lintel gate (&quot;paduraksa&quot;) which leads to the frontcourt.

==== Malaysia ====
The original mosque in Malaysia had a basic architectural style and structure: four support pillars or one large one (&quot;saka guru&quot; or &quot;tiang macu&quot;) for the main foundation, and palm fronds for the pyramidal roof. In Malacca, the architectural design is a cross between local Malay, Indian and Chinese architecture. Traditionally, the minaret resembles a pagoda with the style of a &quot;balai nobat&quot;, a special building where traditional palace music instruments are stored. An ancient cemetery also usually lies next to the mosque where notable local preachers and teachers are buried.

=== Chinese ===

As in other regions, Chinese Islamic architecture reflects local architecture in its style. Some Chinese mosques, especially in eastern China, resemble traditional Chinese temples, with flared Buddhist-style roofs and minarets resembling pagodas. In western China, mosques resemble those of the Middle East, with slender minarets, arches, and domed roofs. In northwest China, the Chinese Hui built their mosques in a combination of eastern and western styles. The mosques are set in walled courtyards entered through archways and they feature flared roofs, miniature domes, and minarets.

The first Chinese mosque was established in the seventh century during the Tang dynasty in Xi&#x27;an. The Great Mosque of Xi&#x27;an, whose current buildings date from the Ming dynasty, does not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, it follows traditional Chinese architecture.

=== Volga Tatar ===

Tatar architecture has evolved through the periods of the Golden Horde, the Tatar khanates and under the rule of the Russian Empire. Many traditional Tatar mosques built by the Volga Tatars have a gabled roof and a minaret placed in the center of the mosque, above the roof, rather than at the side or corner of the building. Examples of such mosques survive from the 18th and 19th centuries and were restored in modern times. This style is also found among the wooden mosques of the Lithuanian Tatars, whose mosque architecture was influenced by the Kazan (Volga) Tatars. Another type of mosque, with a domed roof and a minaret standing above the entrance, appeared in the mid-19th century.

=== Sahel and West Africa ===
In West Africa, Muslim merchants played a vital role in the western Sahel region since the 9th century through trans-Saharan trade networks. While the Islamic architecture of this region shares a certain style, a wide variety of materials and local styles are evident across this wide geographic range. In the more arid western Sahara and northern Sahel regions, stone predominates as a building material and is often associated with Berber cultures. In the southern Sahel and savannah regions mud-brick and rammed earth are the main material and is now associated with the most monumental examples of West African Islamic architecture. In some places, like Timbuktu and Oualata, both building materials are used together, with stone constructions either covered or bound with a mud plaster.The earliest mosques discovered in sub-Saharan Africa are at Kumbi Saleh (in present-day southern Mauritania), the former capital of the Ghana Empire. Here, a mosque has been discovered which consisted of a courtyard, a prayer hall, and a square minaret, built in dry stone covered in red mud used as plaster. On both the exterior and interior of the mosque, this plaster was painted with floral, geometric, and epigraphic motifs. A similar stone mosque from the same period has been found at Awdaghust. Both mosques are dated generally between the 9th and 14th centuries. At Kumbi Saleh, locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king&#x27;s section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 mosques (as described by Al-Bakri), one centered on Friday prayer.

As Islamization progressed across the region, more variations developed in mosque architecture, including the adoption of traditional local forms not previously associated with Islamic architecture. Under Songhai influence, minarets took on a more pyramidal appearance and became stepped or tiered on three levels, as exemplified by the tower of the mosque–tomb of Askia al-Hajj Muhammad in Gao (present-day Mali). In Timbuktu, the Sankoré Mosque (established in the 14th-15th centuries and rebuilt in the 16th century, with later additions), had a tapering minaret and a prayer hall with rows of arches. The presence of tapering minarets may also reflect cultural contacts with M&#x27;zab region to the north, while decoration found at Timbuktu may reflect contacts with Berber communities in what is now Mauritania. 
In the earthen (mud) architecture of the region, scholar Andrew Petersen distinguishes two main styles: a &quot;western&quot; style that may have its roots in Djenné (present-day Mali), and an &quot;eastern&quot; style associated with Hausa architecture that may have its roots in Kano (present-day Nigeria). The eastern or Hausa style is generally more plain on the exterior of buildings, but is characterized by diverse interior decoration and the much greater use of wood. Mosques often have prayer halls with pillars supporting flat or slightly domed roofs of wood and mud. An exceptional example is the 19th-century Great Mosque of Zaria (present-day Nigeria), which has parabolic arches and a roof of shallow domes. The western or &quot;Sudan&quot; style is characterized by more elaborate and decorated exterior façades whose compositions emphasize verticality. They have tapering buttresses with cone-shaped summits, mosques have a large tower over the mihrab, and wooden stakes (&quot;toron&quot;) are often embedded in the walls &quot;–&quot; used for scaffolding but possibly also for some symbolic purpose. 

More hybrid styles also arose further south and on the edge of Islamized areas. In the Fouta Djallon region, in the Guinea Highlands, mosques were built with a traditional rectangular or square layout, but then covered by a huge conical thatched roof which protects from the rain. This type of roof was an existing feature of the traditional circular huts inhabited by the locals, re-adapted to cover new rectangular mosques when the mostly Muslim Fula people settled the region in the 18th century. A good example is the Friday mosque of Dinguiraye in Guinea, built in 1850 (with later restorations). Many others are attested in the same region overlapping with southern Senegal, western Mali, and Burkina Faso.

During the French colonial occupation of the Sahel, French engineers and architects had a role in popularizing a &quot;Neo-Sudanese&quot; style based on local traditional architecture but emphasizing symmetry and monumentality. The Great Mosque of Djenné, which was previously established in the 14th century but demolished in the early 19th century, was rebuilt in 1906–1907 under the direction of Ismaila Traoré and with guidance from French engineers. Now the largest earthen building in sub-Saharan Africa, it served as a model for the new style and for other mosques in the region, including the Grand Mosque of Mopti built by the French administration in 1935. Other 20th-century and more recent mosques in West Africa have tended to replicate a more generic style similar to that of modern Egypt.

=== East Africa ===
East African architecture lacks some features typical of Islamic architecture, such as the construction of hammams. Historic mosques were generally rectangular in plan, lacked courtyards, and featured side rooms. Along the East African coast, common construction materials included coral stone, sundried bricks, and limestone. in the Somali coastal towns, local architecture reflected a certain degree of influence from Islamic architecture in other regions. New buildings were often built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that continued for centuries.

The oldest known mosques in the region were excavated at Shanga in present-day Kenya, where a succession of mosques on one site were built and rebuilt from the 9th to 14th centuries. Other early mosques include the Great Mosque of Kilwa (described below), the Kizimkazi Mosque in Zanzibar (rebuilt in the 18th century over 12th foundations), and three 13th-century mosques in Mogadishu. Ruins of early mosques and other structures are also found at Gedi.

The Fakhr al-Din Mosque in Mogadishu, dated to 1269, is the most architecturally sophisticated mosque in East Africa. It consists of a courtyard leading to a square hypostyle prayer of nine bays, with a dome over the central bay which resembles the conical domes of Anatolian Seljuk architecture. The mihrab is carved from marble from northern India. It also features the oldest known minaret in East Africa, a feature which did not become common in the region until the 19th century.

Kilwa, off the coast of Tanzania, hosts the remains of multiple historic mosques and palaces. The Great Mosque is most impressive, the largest in East Africa before the 19th century. It was built and modified in multiple phases, with the oldest surviving section dating possibly to the 11th century, to which was later added a courtyard with porticos of coral stone columns and a side chamber with the largest historic dome on the East African coast (5 meters in diameter). The courtyard is the only known medieval example of its kind in the region, though it was rebuilt and covered with domes and barrel vaults in the 15th century.

Apart from mosques, the most common type of historic building to have survived, even if only partially, are palaces. Monumental palaces have been excavated at Shanga and at Manda which date from before 1000 CE. The largest pre-19th-century palace along the coastal region is Husuni Kubwa at Kilwa, dating possibly to the 13th century, which has an imposing entrance and multiple sections arranged around internal courtyards. Starting in the early 19th century, the Omanis introduced a new type of palace with multiple stories.

== In modern times ==


In modern times, the architecture of Islamic buildings, not just religious ones, has gone through some changes. The new architectural style doesn&#x27;t stick with the same fundamental aspects that were seen in the past, but mosques for the most part still feature the same parts—the &quot;miḥrāb&quot; (), the minarets, four-iwan plan, and the &quot;pishtaq&quot;. A difference to note is the appearance of mosques without domes, as in the past mosques for the most part all had them, but these new dome-less mosques seem to follow a function over form design, and are created by those not of the Islamic faith, in most cases. The influence of Islam still pervades the style of creation itself, and provides a &#x27;conceptual framework&#x27;, for the making of a building that exemplifies the styles and beliefs of Islam. It has also been influenced by the now meeting of many different cultures, such as European styles meeting Islamic styles, leading to Islamic architects incorporating features of other architectural and cultural styles.

=== Urban design and Islam ===
Urban design and the tradition of Islamic styled architecture have begun to combine to form a new &#x27;neo-Islamic&#x27; style, where the efficiency of the urban style meshes with the spirituality and aesthetic characteristics of Islamic styles. Islamic Architecture in itself is a style that showcases the values, and the culture of Islam, but in modern times sticking to tradition is falling out of practice, so a combination style formed. Examples showing this are places such as the Marrakesh Menara Airport, the Islamic Cultural Center and Museum of Tolerance, &quot;Masjid Permata Qolbu&quot;, the concept for The Vanishing Mosque, and the &quot;Mazar-e-Quaid.&quot; All of these buildings show the influence of Islam over them, but also the movements of things like minimalism which are rising to popularity in the architectural field. Designers that use the aspects of both modern styles and the Islamic styles found a way to have the Western-inspired modernism with the classical cultural aspects of Islamic architecture. This concept though brings up the controversy of the identity of the Islamic community, of the traditional Islamic community, within a space that doesn&#x27;t follow the way they knew it.

=== Debates on status as a style of architecture ===
There are some who also debate whether Islamic Architecture can truly be called a style, as the religious aspect is seen as separate and having no bearing on the architectural style, while on the other side people also argue that the newfound trend and divergence from the style of old Islamic Architecture is what is causing the style to lose its status. There are scholars that also believe that the distinguishing features of the Islamic Architecture style were not necessarily found within the architecture, but were rather environmental markers, such as the sounds of prayer, the city around it, the events that occurred there. The example given is that we can only truly know that a building is a mosque by what happens there, rather than by visual cues. Specific features that are notably related to Islamic Architecture – the Mihrab, the Minaret, and the Gate – are seen in multiple locations and do not always serve the same use, and symbolism for being Islamic in nature is seen to be demonstrated more culturally than it is architecturally. Islamic Architecture is also sometimes referred to as a &#x27;hidden architecture&#x27;, one that doesn&#x27;t necessarily show the physical traits of the style, rather it is something that is experienced.

== Connections and deeper meanings ==
=== Difficulty forming connections ===
Islamic architecture is a neglected subject within historical studies of world architecture. Many scholars that study historical architecture often gloss over, if not completely ignore Islamic structures. This is caused by multiple elements, one being that there are little historic literary works that express an Islamic architect&#x27;s motives with their structures. Due to the wide geographic range of the Islamic religion, there is a large variation between thousands of existing mosques with little consistency between them. Lastly, since it is against the Islamic faith to idolize earthly beings, any depictions of earthly beings lack religious connection. These characteristics combine to make it difficult for historians to form symbolic connections from architecture in Islamic places of worship. Some authors have attempted to ascribe mystical or mathematical symbolisms to various aspects Islamic architecture. However, while these symbolic meanings may be plausible for certain specific buildings, they are not necessarily applicable to the rest of Islamic architecture.

=== Religious and societal connections ===
Unlike Christianity, Islamic art tends to not depict living beings because it is viewed as a conflict with the Qur&#x27;an. From an Islamic viewpoint, anything created by God is under his order and thus should not be idolized. This leaves typical religious Western symbols out of the picture, and replaces them with an emphasis on complex geometrical shapes and patterns.

There are several aspects of Islamic architecture that to modern knowledge lack a symbolic religious meaning, but there are connections that do exist. A repeated and significant motif in mosques is calligraphy. Calligraphy plays a huge role in delivering religious connections through artistic design. Calligraphy, in a mosque setting, is specifically used to reference excerpts from both the Qur&#x27;an and Muhammad&#x27;s teachings. These references are one of the few religious connections architects include within their work.

==== Status and hierarchy ====
Islamic architecture varies vastly across the world. Specifically, some mosques have different goals and intentions than others. These intentions often highlighted religious and social hierarchies within the mosque. Mosques are designed to have the least significant portions of the layout closest to the entrance, as people move deeper into the building more significant religious areas are revealed. Hierarchy is also present because certain Islamic architects are tasked to design specifically for the presence of royalty, although in Islamic belief all Muslims in the mosque are equal. Designated locations had been carefully chosen in the mosque to highlight an individual&#x27;s position in society. This emphasis could be made by being within view to all attendees, by being placed in the focal point of artistry, or with a maqsurah.

Maintaining a sociological hierarchy within a mosque would typically represent a recognition by a higher being aware of a delegation of power. This hierarchy does exist but not with any sort of religious message as Hillenbrand points out, &quot;in neither case is this hierarchy employed for especially portentous ends.&quot; Hierarchy exists in the church in different forms, but is meant for purely functional purposes.

=== Structural intentions ===
Deeper meanings in Islamic architecture often take form as functional purposes. For example, mosques are built around the idea that it should not just be a place of mesmerizing aesthetics, but a place where the aesthetics&#x27; fluidity guide the person into proper worship.

A key feature of the mosque is the mihrab, a universal part of any Islamic place of worship. The mihrab is easily identifiable through a receding wall and a gable overhead often consisting of intricate patterns. Upon entering, the most crucial religious function the architecture of the mosque serves to deliver is the &quot;qibla&quot;. The &quot;qibla&quot; is necessary for proper Islamic worship, and is revealed through architectural means.

<doc id="276106" wikidata="Q672821" url="?curid=276106" title="Molar concentration">
<text>Molar concentration (also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration) is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species, in particular, of a solute in a solution, in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution. In chemistry, the most commonly used unit for molarity is the number of moles per liter, having the unit symbol mol/L or mol/dm3 in SI units. A solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L is said to be 1 molar, commonly designated as 1 M or 1 M. Molarity is often depicted with square brackets around the substance of interest; for example, the molarity of the hydrogen ion is depicted as [H+].

==Definition==
Molar concentration or molarity is most commonly expressed in units of moles of solute per litre of solution. For use in broader applications, it is defined as amount of substance of solute per unit volume of solution, or per unit volume available to the species, represented by lowercase formula_1:

:formula_2

Here, formula_3 is the amount of the solute in moles, formula_4 is the number of constituent particles present in volume formula_5 (in litres) of the solution, and formula_6 is the Avogadro constant, since 2019 defined as exactly . The ratio formula_7 is the number density formula_8.

In thermodynamics, the use of molar concentration is often not convenient because the volume of most solutions slightly depends on temperature due to thermal expansion. This problem is usually resolved by introducing temperature correction factors, or by using a temperature-independent measure of concentration such as molality.

The quantity represents the dilution (volume) which can appear in Ostwald&#x27;s law of dilution.

===Formality or analytical concentration===

If a molecule or salt dissociates in solution, the concentration refers to the original chemical formula in solution, the molar concentration is sometimes called formal concentration or formality (&quot;F&quot;A) or analytical concentration (&quot;c&quot;A). For example, if a sodium carbonate solution () has a formal concentration of &quot;c&quot;() = 1 mol/L, the molar concentrations are &quot;c&quot;() = 2 mol/L and &quot;c&quot;() = 1 mol/L because the salt dissociates into these ions.

==Units==
In the International System of Units (SI), the coherent unit for molar concentration is mol/m3. However, most chemical literature traditionally uses mol/dm3, which is the same as mol/L. This traditional unit is often called a molar and denoted by the letter M, for example:
:1 mol/m3 = 10−3 mol/dm3 = 10−3 mol/L = 10−3 M = 1 mM = 1 mmol/L.

The SI prefix &quot;mega&quot; (symbol M) has the same symbol. However, the prefix is never used alone, so &quot;M&quot; unambiguously denotes molar.
Sub-multiples, such as &quot;millimolar&quot; (mM) and &quot;nanomolar&quot; (nM), consist of the unit preceded by an SI prefix:

== Related quantities ==
=== Number concentration ===
The conversion to number concentration formula_9 is given by

:formula_10

where formula_6 is the Avogadro constant.

=== Mass concentration ===
The conversion to mass concentration formula_12 is given by

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the molar mass of constituent formula_15.

=== Mole fraction ===
The conversion to mole fraction formula_16 is given by

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the average molar mass of the solution, formula_19 is the density of the solution.

A simpler relation can be obtained by considering the total molar concentration, namely, the sum of molar concentrations of all the components of the mixture:

:formula_20

=== Mass fraction ===
The conversion to mass fraction formula_21 is given by

:formula_22

=== Molality ===
For binary mixtures, the conversion to molality formula_23 is

:formula_24

where the solvent is substance 1, and the solute is substance 2.

For solutions with more than one solute, the conversion is

:formula_25

== Properties ==
=== Sum of molar concentrations – normalizing relations ===
The sum of molar concentrations gives the total molar concentration, namely the density of the mixture divided by the molar mass of the mixture or by another name the reciprocal of the molar volume of the mixture. In an ionic solution, ionic strength is proportional to the sum of the molar concentration of salts.

=== Sum of products of molar concentrations and partial molar volumes ===
The sum of products between these quantities equals one:
:formula_26

=== Dependence on volume ===
The molar concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion. On small intervals of temperature, the dependence is

:formula_27

where formula_28 is the molar concentration at a reference temperature, formula_29 is the thermal expansion coefficient of the mixture.

<text>The piping plover (Charadrius melodus) is a small sand-colored, sparrow-sized shorebird that nests and feeds along coastal sand and gravel beaches in North America. The adult has yellow-orange-red legs, a black band across the forehead from eye to eye, and a black stripe running along the breast line. This chest band is usually thicker in males during the breeding season, and it is the only reliable way to tell the sexes apart. The bird is difficult to see when it is standing still, as it blends well with open, sandy beach habitats. It typically runs in short, quick spurts and then stops.

There are two subspecies of piping plovers: the eastern population is known as &quot;Charadrius melodus melodus&quot; and the mid-west population is known as &quot;C. m. circumcinctus&quot;. The bird&#x27;s name is derived from its plaintive bell-like whistles which are often heard before the bird is visible.

In 1986, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service listed the Great Lakes population as endangered and the Northern Great Plains and Atlantic populations as threatened. Intensive conservation efforts have yielded slow population growth, but only some populations have met the recovery goals set for them. The growth trend is expected to reverse if conservation efforts were stopped. Total population was estimated to be between 7600 and 8400 individuals in 2020.

Their breeding habitat includes beaches and sand flats on the Atlantic coast, the shores of the Great Lakes, and in the mid-west of Canada and the United States. They nest on sandy or gravel beaches or shoals. These shorebirds forage for food on beaches, usually by sight, moving across the beaches in short bursts. Generally, piping plovers will forage for food around the high tide wrack zone and along the water&#x27;s edge. They eat mainly insects, marine worms, and crustaceans.

==Taxonomy==
American naturalist George Ord described the piping plover in 1824. Two subspecies are recognized, including nominate &quot;C. m. melodus&quot; of the Atlantic Coast and &quot;C. m. circumcinctus&quot; of the Great Plains. On average, &quot;circumcinctus&quot; is darker overall with more contrastingly dark cheeks and lores. Breeding &quot;circumcinctus&quot; males show more extensive black on forehead and bill-base and more often shows complete breast-bands. Some overlap exists.

==Description==

The piping plover is a stout bird with a large rounded head, a short thick neck, and a stubby bill. It is a sand-colored, dull gray/khaki, sparrow-sized shorebird. The adult has yellow-orange legs, the male has a prominent black band across the forehead from eye to eye, and a black ring around the neck during the breeding season. The band on the female&#x27;s brow is much fainter. During nonbreeding season, the black bands become less pronounced. Its bill is orange with a black tip. It ranges from in length, with a wingspan of and a mass of .

===Vocalizations===
The piping plover&#x27;s light call is a soft, whistled &quot;peep peep&quot; given by standing and flying birds. Its frequently heard alarm call is a soft &quot;pee-werp&quot;, which the second syllable lower pitched.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The piping plover lives the majority of its life on open sandy beaches or rocky shores, often in high, dry sections away from water. They can be found on the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. and Canada on the ocean or bay beaches and on the Great Lakes shores. It builds its nests higher on the shore near beach grass and other objects. It is very rare to see a piping plover anywhere outside of sand or rocky beaches/shores while not migrating. Notably, they are considered a &quot;disturbance-dependent species&quot; due to their habitat&#x27;s relationship with severe flooding. They need their nesting sites to be far away from the water to be dry for their entire nesting period – yet, they also need to nest in open sand. Often, this combination only occurs in sites which are thoroughly flooded once every few years, which brings in fresh sand and clears away vegetation. As human coastal management strategies worked to minimize unpredictable flooding, their old habitats often became overgrown, and their populations declined. Nowadays, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is forced to artificially clear shoals on the Platte and Missouri River to maintain some of the plovers&#x27; remaining habitat in the Great Plains. However, while these efforts are important, they remain inferior to natural periodically flooded habitats. 

Alongside least terns, piping plovers also have an unusual relationship with mining. Whereas most species predictably suffer habitat loss from mining activities in their area, these birds are known to nest in waste sand piles generated by nearby mines, as the replacement for sand bars. Those sand piles remain topped-up and hostile to vegetation overgrowth as long as the mining activity continues. Often, mining sites end up reclaimed for housing development at the end of their lifespan, which means more construction work, and an extended persistence of waste sand piles. However, modern mining practices typically transport much of this waste sand to more remote areas, often to reuse it commercially, which limits colonization opportunities for these birds.

Piping plovers migrate from their northern range in the summer to the south in the winter months, migrating to the Gulf of Mexico, the southern Atlantic coast of the United States and the Caribbean, including The Bahamas. They have also been recorded across Cuba, with rarer occurrences elsewhere throughout the West Indies, and even Ecuador and Venezuela. They begin migrating north in mid-March. Their breeding grounds extend from southern Newfoundland south to the northern parts of South Carolina. Migration south begins in August for some adults and fledglings, and by mid-September most piping plovers have headed south for winter.

==Behavior==
===Breeding===
The piping plover usually arrives at sandy beaches to breed in mid-March.

Males will begin claiming territories and pairing up in late March. When pairs are formed, the male begins digging out several scrapes (nests) along the high shore near the beach-grass line. The males also perform elaborate courtship ceremonies, including stone tossing and courtship flights featuring repeated dives. Scrapes, small depressions in the sand dug by kicking the sand, are often in the same area that least terns choose to colonize. Females will sit and evaluate the scrapes, then choose a good scrape and decorate the nest with shells and debris to camouflage it. Once a scrape is seen as sufficient, the female will allow the male to copulate with her. The male begins a mating ritual of standing upright and &quot;marching&quot; towards the female, puffing himself up and quickly stomping his legs. If the female had seen the scrape as adequate, she will allow the male to stand on her back and copulation occurs within a few minutes.

Most first-time nest attempts in each breeding season are four-egg nests which appear as early as mid-to-late April. Females lay one egg every other day. Second, third and sometimes fourth nesting attempts may have only three or two eggs. Incubation of the nest is shared by both the male and the female. Incubation is generally 27 days and eggs usually all hatch on the same day.

After chicks hatch, they are able to walk within hours, and must have access to feeding areas to feed on marine macro invertebrates. The adults&#x27; role is to protect them from the elements by brooding them. They also alert them to any danger. Like many other species of plovers, adult piping plovers will often feign a &quot;broken wing display&quot;, drawing attention to themselves and away from the chicks when a predator may be threatening the chicks&#x27; safety. The broken wing display is also used during the nesting period to distract predators from the nest. A major defense mechanism of the chicks is their ability to blend in with the sand. It takes about 30 days before chicks achieve flight capability. They must be able to fly at least before they can be considered fledglings.

To protect the nests from predators during incubation, many conservationists use exclosures, such as round turkey-wire cages with screened tops. These allow the adults to move in and out but stop predators from getting to the eggs. After the chicks hatch, many areas will put up snow fencing to restrict driving and pets for the safety of the chicks. Threats to nests include crows, cats, raccoons, and foxes, among others. Exclosures are not always used, as they occasionally draw more attention to the nest than would occur without the exclosure. Natural hazards to eggs or chicks include storms, high winds, and abnormal high tides; human disturbances can cause the abandonment of nests and chicks as well. It is best to stay away from any bird that appears distressed to prevent any unintended consequences.

==Status and conservation==
The piping plover is globally threatened and endangered; it is uncommon and local within its range, and has been listed by the United States as &quot;endangered&quot; in the Great Lakes region and &quot;threatened&quot; in the remainder of its range. While it is federally threatened, the piping plover has been listed as state endangered in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Parker River Refuge on Plum Island, Massachusetts is a national network of lands and rivers dedicated to the safety of its native wildlife and specifically the piping plover. Protecting the Piper with full beach closures, the Refuge now &quot;has the second largest plover population on the [Massachusetts] North Shore&quot;.

In eastern Canada, the piping plover is found only on coastal beaches. In 1985, it was declared an endangered species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. A large population in Ontario has disappeared entirely. In 2008, however, piping plover nests were found at Wasaga Beach and near Sauble Beach, Ontario, along the Ontario Great Lakes shores. There is also some evidence of nesting at other sites in Ontario, including Port Elgin, Ontario in 2014.
In the 19th century and early 20th century, the piping plover was used for its feathers, as were many other birds at the time, as decorations for women&#x27;s hats. These decorations, called plumes, became a symbol of high society, especially those from larger rare birds. This practice led to its initial population decline. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 helped the population recover through the 1930s. The second decline in the piping plover&#x27;s population and range has been attributed to increased development, shoreline stabilization efforts, habitat loss and human activity near nesting sites in the decades following World War II. The Great Lakes populations eventually shrank to only around two dozen. On the Missouri River sandbars, the number of breeding individuals varied, with the population increasing from 2012 to 2017 following a major habitat creation event.

Critical nesting habitats are now being protected to help the population during its breeding season. Populations have seen significant increases since the protection programs began, but the species remains in serious danger. Some USGS research suggests that in the northern Great Plains, low connectivity between scattered habitats mean that even maintaining the current population sizes will be a great challenge, and there&#x27;s an 8–37% risk of those subpopulations disappearing near the end of the century. Current conservation strategies include identification and preservation of known nesting sites; public education; limiting or preventing pedestrian and/or off-road vehicle (ORV) traffic near nests and hatched chicks; limiting predation of free-ranging cats, dogs and other pets on breeding pairs, eggs and chicks; and removal of foxes, raccoons, skunks, and other predators.

In coastal areas such as Plymouth, Cape Cod, Long Island, Sandy Hook, Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware, North Manitou Island in Lake Michigan, and most recently, Cape Hatteras National Seashore on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, beach access to pedestrians and off-road vehicles has been limited to protect piping plovers and their chicks at critical times of the breeding season. 

Many studies have documented piping plovers&#x27; successes and struggles with human recreation or other predatory concerns. For example, piping plovers are much less likely to successfully fledge in heavily trafficked, popular recreational areas. Additionally, those that do fledge in active recreational areas tend to take longer to fledge. Most interestingly, chicks will spend less time foraging on weekends, since this tends to be when beaches are most active and disturbance will be at its highest. Despite the multitude of anthropogenic conservation concerns regarding the piping plover, a study on plovers on Long Island, New York found that the most significant cause of nest failure in the species was not humans, but depredation by the Red fox. Birds either lost their nests due to depredation of the nest, or significant predator presence and subsequent abandonment of the nest by adults. Birds rarely abandoned nests due to human presence.

Various environmental organizations are involved in aiding restoration efforts. The Goldenrod Foundation unsuccessfully filed suit against the Town of Plymouth in 2010 and 2015 to restrict offroad vehicle access to breeding habitat.

In 2019, the first documented pair of piping plovers in Chicago nested at Montrose Beach. The pair, named Monty and Rose by locals, hatched three chicks in July, becoming the first within Cook County in 60 years. Threats to the nest and chicks included a planned music festival that was canceled to ensure the birds were protected. Monty and Rose returned to the area in 2020 and 2021, again laying eggs and hatching chicks, although some eggs and chicks were lost to natural predators. In May 2022, the male shorebird, Monty, died after returning to Montrose Beach. Rose did not return in 2022. In late April 2023, Monty and Rose&#x27;s offspring Imani was spotted at Montrose Beach along with an unbanded male and an unbanded female. In 2024, Imani returned to Montrose Beach again, this time joined by another banded male and a female named Searocket, who had been released at the beach as a captive-reared chick the previous summer; Imani and Searocket produced their first egg in late May. 

== Climate change ==
As shorebirds, piping plovers may be highly impacted by climate change, as it affects their aquatic and their terrestrial habitats. At the same time, the &quot;disturbance-dependent&quot; nature of their habitat makes their relationship to climate change more complex than of most other bird species.

=== Increasing sand temperatures ===
Higher sand temperatures directly and negatively affect piping plovers. Piping plovers nest on the ground in open areas, which regularly subjects them to high temperatures. Because of these high temperatures, piping plovers (along with other ground-nesting bird species) have specific strategies and behaviors for thermal regulation of their nests and themselves. Research has been conducted to evaluate how sand temperature affects piping plover nesting behaviors in a population of piping plovers in North Dakota during the 2014-2015 breeding seasons. As sand temperatures increased, piping plover nest attendance decreased and the frequency and duration of daily shading behaviors increased. Rising ground temperatures will likely have significant effects on piping plovers&#x27; ground-nesting behavior.

=== Inland habitat water level rise ===
A main part of the piping plover&#x27;s range is in the Prairie Pothole Region of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Canada. The shallow wetlands of this region fluctuate water surface area in response to wet-dry periods. Piping plovers who breed in this region depend on the decreased water levels to reveal shorelines that they use for nesting. Climate change, along with consolidation drainage, drainage of smaller wetlands into another wetland to create fewer, larger wetlands, has begun to create fuller wetlands, reducing shoreline nesting habitat. Research of 32 piping plover wetland habitats in this region found that wetlands with risen water levels had lower chances of piping plover presence. This suggests that the warming climate and increased water levels and precipitation will degrade piping plover breeding habitats in the Prairie Pothole Region.

On the other hand, research suggests that piping plover&#x27;s habitat in Nebraska, on the shoals of Platte and Missouri River and around Lewis and Clark Lake would benefit from climate change, as it would make extensive flooding (so called &quot;high-flow events&quot;) which keeps the shoals from getting overgrown occur more often than it does now, yet closer to the historical, pre-European colonization of the Americas patterns. The ideal frequency of high-flow events for piping plover population abundance in this river system is once in four years. Shoreline stabilization efforts reduced such high-flow events to once per twenty years, which is not enough to maintain piping plover populations outside of artificially cleared shoals, which become their only refuge in the long term. Climate change would only be harmful to these populations overall if it either makes high-flow events occur more often than once every four years, or if it ends making the basin drier and ultimately reduces their frequency even further, and both are considered unlikely. However, it is more plausible that in at least the near term, climate change adaptation efforts to protect human property in the area would continue to suppress high-flow events and negate this benefit to piping plover populations, while also making them more vulnerable to a potential, unprecedented catastrophic flooding event which could overwhelm those efforts and also submerge piping plover subpopulations across the entire area.

=== Coastal habitat sea level rise ===
Climate change is also causing sea level rise, which may affect the piping plover&#x27;s other main habitat, the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. and Canada. Research has assessed sea level rise&#x27;s threat to the piping plover habitat on barrier islands in Long Island, New York, finding that sea level rise will reduce piping plover breeding areas. Breeding habitats have the potential to migrate inland, but would still be reduced as a result of human development, which would reduce the migrated habitat 5-12%. This may lead to conflict between piping plover habitat conservation and human recreation because sea level rise will make the habitats take up a larger proportion of the islands. Research also shows that a large hurricane with the risen sea levels could flood up to 95% of piping plover habitat, so increased coastal storms induced by climate change, combined with rising sea level, could be very damaging.

Similar research has been conducted on the Florida coastline, part of the piping plovers&#x27;s Atlantic coast habitat, to evaluate the habitat&#x27;s sensitivity to sea level rise caused by climate change. Florida coastline species are at particular risk to climate change because of not just sea level rise, but also increased tropical storms. The piping plover depends on this habitat because it migrates south from its breeding habitats to winter in Florida for about three months. It is predicted that there will be a 16% loss of coastal landforms from inundation by the year 2100. Further, the sea level rise may make the coastline more complex, which may produce more habitat fragmentation. Thus, the changing landforms of the Florida coastline will likely affect piping plover ecology. Research also shows that of the shorebird species affected by the Florida coastline transformation, piping plovers are at high risk of decline.

== In popular culture ==
In May 2023, the United States Postal Service released a piping plover Forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp was dedicated at a ceremony at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, one of the biggest nesting sites for piping plovers.

<text>Jumping spiders are a group of spiders that constitute the family Salticidae. , this family contained over 600 described genera and over 6,000 described species, making it the largest family of spiderscomprising 13% of spider species. Jumping spiders have some of the best vision among arthropods — being capable of stereoptic color vision — and use sight in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps. Both their book lungs and tracheal system are well-developed, and they use both systems (bimodal breathing). Jumping spiders are generally recognized by their eye pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes, with the anterior median pair (the two front middle eyes) being particularly large.

== Description ==

Jumping spiders are among the easiest to distinguish from similar spider families because of the shape of the cephalothorax and their eye patterns. The families closest to Salticidae in general appearance are the Corinnidae (distinguished also by prominent spines on the back four legs), the Oxyopidae (the lynx spiders, distinguished by very prominent spines on all legs), and the Thomisidae (the crab spiders, distinguished by their front four legs, which are very long and powerful). None of these families, however, have eyes that resemble those of the Salticidae. Conversely, the legs of jumping spiders are not covered with any very prominent spines. Their front four legs generally are larger than the hind four, but not as dramatically so as those of the crab spiders, nor are they held in the outstretched-arms attitude characteristic of the Thomisidae. In spite of the length of their front legs, Salticidae depend on their rear legs for jumping. The generally larger front legs are used partly to assist in grasping prey, and in some species, the front legs and pedipalps are used in species-recognition signaling.

The jumping spiders, unlike the other families, have faces that are roughly rectangular surfaces perpendicular to their direction of motion. In effect this means that their forward-looking, anterior eyes are on &quot;flat faces&quot;, as shown in the photographs. Their eye pattern is the clearest single identifying characteristic. They have eight eyes, as illustrated. Most diagnostic are the front row of four eyes, in which the anterior median pair are more dramatically prominent than any other spider eyes apart from the posterior median eyes of the Deinopidae. There is, however, a radical functional difference between the major (anterior median) eyes of Salticidae and the major (posterior median) eyes of the Deinopidae; the large posterior eyes of Deinopidae are adapted mainly to vision in dim light, whereas the large anterior eyes of Salticidae are adapted to detailed, three-dimensional vision for purposes of estimating the range, direction, and nature of potential prey, permitting the spider to direct its attacking leaps with great precision. The anterior lateral eyes, though large, are smaller than the anterior median eyes and provide a wider forward field of vision.

The rear row of four eyes may be described as strongly bent, or as being rearranged into two rows, with two large posterior lateral eyes being the furthest back. They serve for lateral vision. The posterior median eyes also have been shifted out laterally, almost as far as the posterior lateral eyes. They are usually much smaller than the posterior lateral eyes and there is doubt about whether they are at all functional in many species.

The body length of jumping spiders generally ranges from . The largest is &quot;Hyllus giganteus&quot;, while other genera with relatively large species include &quot;Phidippus&quot;, &quot;Philaeus&quot; and &quot;Plexippus&quot;.

In addition to using their silk for safety lines while jumping, they also build silken &quot;pup tents&quot;, where they take shelter from bad weather and sleep at night. They molt in these shelters, build and store egg cases in them, and also spend the winter in them.

Their body&#x27;s sensory hairs are able to detect airborne acoustic stimuli up to 3 m away.

== Vision ==

Jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes; three secondary pairs that are fixed and a principal pair that is movable.

The posterior median eyes are vestigial in many species, but in some primitive subfamilies, they are comparable in size with the other secondary eyes and help to detect motion. While unable to form images, the reduced pair of eyes is thought to have a role similar to that of insect ocelli by receiving light from the sky. The photoreceptors in the other secondary pairs are almost exclusively green-sensitive, but the posterior median eyes have two visual opsins different from those in all the other eyes, sensitive to blue and UV light.

The posterior lateral eyes (PLEs) are wide-angle motion detectors that sense motions from the side and behind. Combined with the other eyes, PLEs give the spider a near 360° view of the world.

The anterior lateral eyes (ALEs) have the best visual acuity of the secondary eyes. They are able to distinguish some details, as well, and without them, no &quot;looming response&quot; can be triggered by motion. Even with all the other pairs covered, jumping spiders in a study could still detect, stalk, and attack flies, using their ALEs only, which are also sufficiently widely spaced to provide stereoscopic vision.

The anterior median eyes have very good vision. This pair of eyes is built like a telescopic tube with a corneal lens in the front and a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow, boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the ultraviolet (UV) range. As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have instead evolved a method called image defocus. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the two closest to the surface contain a UV-sensitive opsin (visual pigment), while the two deepest contain a green-sensitive opsin. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of defocus from the fuzzy layer, calculating the distance to the objects in front of them is possible. In addition to receptor cells, red filters also have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. All salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, seemingly are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (such as &quot;Cosmophasis umbratica&quot;) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling. Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.

The anterior median eyes have high resolution (11 min visual angle), but the field of vision is narrow, from 2 to 5°. The central region of the retina, where acuity is highest, is no more than six or seven receptor rows wide. However, the eye can scan objects off the direct axis of vision. As the lens is attached to the carapace, the eye&#x27;s scanning movements are restricted to its retina through a complicated pattern of translations and rotations. This dynamic adjustment is a means of compensation for the narrowness of the static field of vision. Movement of the retina in jumping spiders is analogous to the way many vertebrates, such as primates, move their entire eyes to focus images of interest onto their fovea centralis. In jumping spiders with a translucent carapace, such movements within the jumping spider&#x27;s eyes are visible from outside when the attention of the spider is directed to various targets.

== Behavior ==

===Jumping===

Many other arthropods are known to jump, including grasshoppers, fleas, leafhoppers, and sand fleas. Jumping spiders are different from these animals because they are able to make accurate, targeted jumps. Jumps are used for navigation, to escape danger, and to catch prey. When jumping, they use mainly their third or fourth pair of legs, or both pairs, depending on species. Jumping spiders&#x27; well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering the pressure of their body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. The maximum horizontal jump distance varies greatly between species, with some capable of jumping two or three body lengths, while the jump of an individual &quot;Colonus puerperus&quot; was measured at 38 times the body length. The accuracy of their jumps is mediated by their well-developed visual system and the ability to quickly process visual information to tailor each jump. When a jumping spider moves from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or &#x27;dragline&#x27;) to whatever it is standing on. This dragline provides a mechanical aid to jumping, including braking and stabilization and if the jump should fail, the spider climbs back up the dragline.

===Hunting===

The hunting behaviour of the Salticidae is confusingly varied compared to that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is consistent with their highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by swiveling its cephalothorax to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its cephalothorax. After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, before it starts to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider pauses to attach a dragline, then springs onto the prey.

Many variations on the theme and many surprising aspects exist. For one, salticids do not necessarily follow a straight path in approaching prey. They may follow a circuitous course, sometimes even a course that takes the hunter through regions from which the prey is not visible. Such complex adaptive behaviour is hard to reconcile with an organism that has such a tiny brain, but some jumping spiders, in particular some species of &quot;Portia&quot;, can negotiate long detours from one bush down to the ground, then up the stem of another bush to capture a prey item on a particular leaf. Such behaviour still is the subject of research.

Some salticid species are continually on the move, stopping periodically to look around for prey, which they then stalk immediately. Others spend more time scanning their surroundings from one position, actively stalking any prey they detect. Members of the genus &quot;Phaeacius&quot; take that strategy to extremes; they sit on a tree trunk, facing downwards and rarely do any stalking, but simply lunge down on any prey items that pass close before them.

Some Salticidae specialise in particular classes of prey, such as ants. Most spiders, including most salticids, avoid worker ants, but several species not only eat them as a primary item in their diets, but also employ specialised attack techniques; &quot;Anasaitis canosa&quot;, for example, circles around to the front of the ant and grabs it over the back of its head. Such myrmecophagous species, however, do not necessarily refuse other prey items, and routinely catch flies and similar prey in the usual salticid fashion, without the special precautions they apply in hunting dangerous prey such as ants. Ants offer the advantages of being plentiful prey items for which little competition from other predators occurs, but catching less hazardous prey when it presents itself remains profitable.

Some of the most surprising hunting behaviours occur among the araneophagous Salticidae, and vary greatly in method. Many of the spider-hunting species quite commonly attack other spiders, whether fellow salticids or not, in the same way as any other prey, but some kinds resort to web invasion; nonspecialists such as &quot;Phidippus audax&quot; sometimes attack prey ensnared in webs, basically in acts of kleptoparasitism; sometimes they leap onto and eat the web occupant itself, or simply walk over the web for that purpose.

Salticidae in the genera &quot;Brettus&quot;, &quot;Cyrba&quot;, &quot;Gelotia&quot;, and &quot;Portia&quot; display more advanced web-invasion behavior. They slowly advance onto the web and vibrate the silk with their pedipalps and legs. In this respect, their behaviour resembles that of the Mimetidae, probably the most specialised of the araneophagous spider families. If the web occupant approaches in the manner appropriate to dealing with ensnared prey, the predator attacks.

The foregoing examples present the Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they would hardly seem likely to build webs other than those used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species really do not build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also go hunting like other salticids. Some &quot;Portia&quot; species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not as impressive as some orb webs of the Araneidae; &quot;Portia&quot; webs are of an unusual funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. &quot;Spartaeus&quot; species, though, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of the Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is a relic of the evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.

In hunting, the Salticidae also use their silk as a tether to enable them to reach prey that otherwise would be inaccessible. For example, by advancing towards the prey to less than the jumping distance, then retreating and leaping in an arc at the end of the tether line, many species can leap onto prey on vertical or even on inverted surfaces, which of course would not be possible without such a tether.

Having made contact with the prey, hunting Salticidae administer a bite to inject rapid-acting venom that gives the victim little time to react. In this respect, they resemble the Mimetidae and Thomisidae, families that ambush prey that often are larger than the predator, and they do so without securing the victim with silk; they accordingly must immobilise it immediately and their venom is adapted accordingly.

=== Sleeping ===
Among several organisms, scientists have discovered that octopuses and cuttlefish experience REM sleep. Although REM sleep has been proved to be a phase of sleep in various organisms, there was a lack of evidence that supported the presence of REM sleep in insects and arachnids.(Mason, 2022) However, in 2022, a group of researchers published an article on supporting the presence of REM sleep in what was thought to just be a normal sleep cycle in jumping spiders. The group of researchers published an article about the ways in which baby jumping spiders displayed various indicators of REM sleep, similar to those displayed by humans under this phase of deep sleep. More specifically, the jumping spiders displayed a significant amount of action occurring in their retinal tubes and uncoordinated twitches/leg curls under this state. Given that the jumping spiders were observed from 7PM to 7AM, the researchers realized that these actions were not present while they stretched or readjusted their silk webs outside of this time frame. Ultimately, solidifying the indicators of REM sleep in these small organisms.(Rößler et al., 2022)

==Diet==

Although jumping spiders are generally carnivorous, many species have been known to include nectar in their diets. One species, &quot;Bagheera kiplingi&quot;, feeds primarily on Beltian bodies, specialized structures rich in fat and protein, found on some acacia (&quot;Vachellia&quot;) species. None are known to feed on seeds or fruit. Extrafloral nectaries on plants, such as &quot;Chamaecrista fasciculata&quot; (partridge pea), provide jumping spiders with nectar; the plant benefits accordingly when the spiders prey on whatever pests they find.

The female of the Southeast Asian species &quot;Toxeus magnus&quot; feeds its offspring with a milky, nutritious fluid for the first 40 days of their lives.

== Reproduction ==
=== Courtship and mating behavior ===

Jumping spiders conduct complex, visual courtship displays using movements and physical bodily attributes. A form of sexual dimorphism, the males possess plumose hairs, colored or iridescent hairs (particularly pronounced in the peacock spiders), front leg fringes, structures on other legs, and other, often bizarre, modifications. These characteristics are used in a courtship &quot;dance&quot; in which the colored or iridescent parts of the body are displayed. In addition to displaying colors, jumping spiders perform complex sliding, vibrational, or zigzag movements to attract females. Many males have auditory signals, as well. These amplified sounds presented to the females resemble buzzes or drum rolls. Species vary significantly in visual and vibratory components of courtship. The ability to sense UV light (see Vision section) is used by at least one species, &quot;Cosmophasis umbratica&quot;, in courtship behavior, though it is reasonable to assume that many other species exhibit this characteristic. &quot;Cosmophasis umbratica&quot; males have markings that are only visible in UV and the females use the markings for mate choice.

If receptive to the male, the female assumes a passive, crouching position. In some species, the female may vibrate her palps or abdomen. The male then extends his front legs towards the female to touch her. If the female remains receptive, the male climbs on her back and inseminates her with his palps.

=== Consequences of sexual dimorphism ===

Maintaining colorful ornamentation may seem strictly beneficial to sexual selection, yet costs to maintain such distinguishing characteristics occur. While colorful or UV-reflecting individuals may attract more female spiders, it can also increase the risk of predation.

==Taxonomy==
The monophyly of the family Salticidae is well established through both phylogenetic and morphological analyses. The sister group to Salticidae is the family Philodromidae. Synapomorphies of the two families include loss of cylindrical gland spigots and loss of tapeta in the indirect eyes.

A 2015 revision of the Salticidae family divided it into seven subfamilies:
* Onomastinae – 1 extant genus
* Asemoneinae – 4 extant genera (&quot;Hindumanes&quot;, originally placed here, was moved to Lyssomaninae)
* Lyssomaninae – 4 extant genera (including &quot;Hindumanes&quot;)
* Spartaeinae – 29 extant genera in 3 tribes
* Eupoinae – 3 extant genera
* Hisponinae – 6 extant genera
* Salticinae – about 540 extant genera in 27 tribes

The relationships between these subfamilies is still up for debate. Below are the results of a 2017 phylogenomic study that attempted to resolve this question. The subfamily Eupoinae was unevaluated and its exact position is unclear.


== Habitat ==

Jumping spiders live in a variety of habitats. Tropical forests harbor the most species, but they are also found in temperate forests, scrubland, deserts, intertidal zones, and mountainous regions. &quot;Euophrys omnisuperstes&quot; is the species reported to have been collected at the highest elevation, on the slopes of Mount Everest.

==Models for mimicry ==
Some small insects are thought to have evolved an appearance or behavioural traits that resemble those of jumping spiders and this is suspected to prevent their predation, specifically from jumping spiders. Some examples appear to be provided by patterns on the wings of some tephritid flies, the nymph of a fulgorid and possibly some moths.

==Fossils==
Very few jumping spider fossils have been found. Of those known, all are from Cenozoic era amber. The oldest fossils are from Baltic amber dating to the Eocene epoch, specifically, 54 to 42 million years ago. Other fossil jumping spiders have been preserved within Chiapas amber and Dominican amber.

<text>Avant-garde music is music that is considered to be at the forefront of innovation in its field, with the term &quot;avant-garde&quot; implying a critique of existing aesthetic conventions, rejection of the status quo in favor of unique or original elements, and the idea of deliberately challenging or alienating audiences. Avant-garde music may be distinguished from experimental music by the way it adopts an extreme position within a certain tradition, whereas experimental music lies outside tradition.

==Distinctions==
Avant-garde music may be distinguished from experimental music by the way it adopts an extreme position within a certain tradition, whereas experimental music lies outside tradition. The biggest distinction between avant-garde and experimental music was how it relates to tradition. Other distinctions include subject matter, as well as having a superficial idea to avoid diving into serious subjects. Even though avant-garde and experimental music have many distinctions, experimental music and avant-garde music also have similarities due to experimental music being referred to as the &quot;contemporary avant-garde&quot; which is in relation to the electronic style of music being the forefront of many compositions in the 1960s and 1970s.

In a historical sense, some musicologists use the term &quot;avant-garde music&quot; for the radical compositions that succeeded the death of Anton Webern in 1945, but others disagree. For example, Ryan Minor writes that this period began with the work of Richard Wagner, whereas Edward Lowinsky cites Josquin des Prez. The term may also be used to refer to any post-1945 tendency of modernist music not definable as experimental music, though sometimes including a type of experimental music characterized by the rejection of tonality. A commonly cited example of avant-garde music is John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot; (1952), a piece which instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during its entire duration. The piece has been described as &quot;not a musical &#x27;work&#x27; in the normal sense, only an occasion for a Zen-like meditation&quot;.

Although some modernist music is also avant-garde, a distinction can be made between the two categories. According to scholar Larry Sitsky, because the purpose of avant-garde music is necessarily political, social, and cultural critique, so that it challenges social and artistic values by provoking or goading audiences, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, George Antheil, and Claude Debussy may reasonably be considered to have been avant-gardists in their early works (which were understood as provocative, whether or not the composers intended them that way), but Sitsky does not consider the label appropriate for their later music. For example, modernists of the post–World War II period, such as Milton Babbitt, Luciano Berio, Elliott Carter, György Ligeti, and Witold Lutosławski, never conceived their music for the purpose of goading an audience and cannot, therefore, be classified as avant-garde. Composers such as John Cage and Harry Partch, on the contrary, remained avant-gardists throughout their creative careers.

A prominent feature of avant-garde music is to break through various rules and regulations of traditional culture, in order to transcend established creative principles and appreciation habits. Avant-garde music pursues novelty in musical form and style, insisting that art is above everything else; thus, it creates a transcendental and mysterious sound world. Hint, metaphor, symbol, association, imagery, synesthesia and perception are widely used in avant-garde music techniques to excavate the mystery of human heart and the flow of consciousness, so that many seemingly unrelated but essentially very important events interweave into multi-level structures and forms.

==Popular music==
Popular music, by definition, is designed for mass appeal. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in jazz, represented by artists such as Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, John Coltrane and Miles Davis. In the rock music of the 1970s, the &quot;art&quot; descriptor was generally understood to mean &quot;aggressively avant-garde&quot; or &quot;pretentiously progressive&quot;. Post-punk artists from the late 1970s rejected traditional rock sensibilities in favor of an avant-garde aesthetic. In 1988 the writer Greg Tate described hip hop music as &quot;the only avant-garde around, still delivering the shock of the new.&quot; The Beatles song Revolution 9 is one of the most popular examples of avant-garde music inspired pieces in popular music records. The song is the penultimate track to their 1968 album &quot;The Beatles&quot;(aka The White Album).

<text>Chess is a musical with music by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of the pop group ABBA, lyrics by Ulvaeus and Tim Rice, and book by Rice. The story involves a politically driven, Cold War-era chess tournament between two grandmasters, one American and the other Soviet, and their fight over a woman who manages one and falls in love with the other. Although the protagonists were not intended to represent any real individuals, the character of the American grandmaster (named Freddie Trumper in the stage version) was loosely based on Bobby Fischer, while elements of the story may have been inspired by the chess careers of Russian grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov.

&quot;Chess&quot; allegorically reflected the Cold War tensions present in the 1980s. The musical has been referred to as a metaphor for the whole Cold War, with the insinuation being made that the Cold War is itself a manipulative game. Released and staged at the height of the strong anti-communist agenda that came to be known as the &quot;Reagan Doctrine&quot;, &quot;Chess&quot; addressed and satirized the hostility of the international political atmosphere of the 1980s.

As with other productions such as &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Evita&quot;, a highly successful concept album was released prior to the first theatrical production in order to raise money. In the case of &quot;Chess&quot;, the concept album was released in the autumn of 1984 while the show opened in London&#x27;s West End in 1986 where it played for three years. A much-altered US version premiered on Broadway in 1988 with a book by Richard Nelson, but survived only for two months. &quot;Chess&quot; is frequently revised for new productions, many of which try to merge elements from both the British and American versions, but was not revived in the West End until 2018.

&quot;Chess&quot; placed seventh in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Number One Essential Musicals&quot;.

== Development ==

Tim Rice, a lyricist and librettist best known for musicals such as &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Evita&quot;, had long wanted to write a musical about the Cold War. During the mid-1970s, he had discussed the idea of a musical about the Cuban Missile Crisis with his usual collaborator, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, but the idea never came to fruition.

By the late 1970s, Rice had become inspired to tell his Cold War story through the prism of the long-standing United States-Soviet Union chess rivalry; he had earlier been fascinated by the political machinations of the 1972 &quot;Match of the Century&quot; between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. However, by the time Rice wanted to begin work on the musical in early 1979, Lloyd Webber was unavailable, as he was already at work on his next musical, &quot;Cats&quot;.

Subsequently, American producer Richard Vos suggested to Rice to work with Andersson and Ulvaeus instead, knowing that they were looking to develop and produce projects outside of ABBA. An ardent fan of the group, Rice agreed. He later wrote that he felt no reservations because &quot;there is a sense of theatre in the ABBA style&quot;. With Vos also in attendance, Rice met with the two in Stockholm for the first time on 15 December 1981 in order to discuss the concept, and they quickly signed on to the project.

All through 1982 and 1983, the three men worked on the music and lyrics. Rice would describe the mood of particular songs he wanted, then Andersson and Ulvaeus would write and record the music and send the tapes to Rice, who would then write lyrics to fit the music, and send the resulting tapes back to Andersson and Ulvaeus and so on.

Some of the songs on the resulting album contained elements of music Andersson and Ulvaeus had previously written for ABBA. For example, the chorus of &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; was based on the chorus of &quot;I Am An A&quot;, a song from their 1977 tour, while the chorus of &quot;Anthem&quot; used the chord structures from the guitar solo from their 1980 ABBA song &quot;Our Last Summer&quot;.

Ulvaeus would also provide dummy lyrics to emphasise the rhythmic patterns of the music, and since Rice found a number of these &quot;embarrassingly good&quot; as they were, incorporated a few in the final version. The most well known example is &quot;One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble&quot;. One song, which became &quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot;, was recorded with an entire set of lyrics, sung by ABBA&#x27;s Agnetha Fältskog with the title &quot;Every Good Man&quot;, although none of the original lyrics from this song were used.

Partly to raise money in order to produce the show in the West End and partly to see how the material would fare with the public, it was decided to release the music as an album before any stage productions were undertaken, a strategy that had proven successful with Rice&#x27;s two previous musicals, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Evita&quot;.

Owing in part to the different countries in which the lyricist and composers resided, recording on the album musical of &quot;Chess&quot; began in Stockholm in early November 1983, with Andersson recording the many layered keyboard parts himself along with other basic work at their usual Polar Studios, and choral and orchestral work then recorded in London by The Ambrosian Singers along with the London Symphony Orchestra. The album was then sound-engineered and mixed back at Polar by longtime ABBA sound engineer Michael B. Tretow.

== Original album ==

=== History ===
The double LP, often referred to as a concept album or album musical, was released worldwide in the autumn of 1984 by RCA Records. Liner notes included with the album featured a basic synopsis of the story in multiple languages along with song lyrics and numerous photos. The music on the album was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a sumptuously recorded... grandiose pastiche that touches half a dozen bases, from Gilbert and Sullivan to late Rodgers and Hammerstein, from Italian opera to trendy synthesizer-based pop, all of it lavishly arranged for the London Symphony Orchestra with splashy electronic embellishments&quot;. The album featured Murray Head, Tommy Körberg, Elaine Paige, and noted actor Denis Quilley in the role of Molokov. A single from the album, &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot;, with verses performed by Murray Head and choruses performed by Anders Glenmark, became a worldwide smash, reaching #3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The duet &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; by Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickson held the #1 spot on the UK singles charts for four weeks, winning the Ivor Novello Award in the process as the Best Selling Single (&#x27;A&#x27; Side).

On 27 October 1984, a concert version of the album was premiered by the original cast in London&#x27;s Barbican Centre and then performed in Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Paris with final presentation on 1 November in Berwaldhallen in Stockholm.

In 1985, music videos were filmed for the songs &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Side&quot;, &quot;The Arbiter&quot;, and the ballads &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; and &quot;Pity the Child&quot;, featuring the performers from the album, directed by David G Hillier and produced by Nick Maingay. These were released together in a VHS video entitled &quot;Chess Moves&quot;.

===Critical reception===
The original concept album received critical accolades, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; raving that the &quot;dazzling score covers nearly all the pop bases&quot;, Kurt Ganzl&#x27;s &quot;Blackwell Guide to the Musical Theatre on Record&quot; telling readers about the &quot;thrilling exposition of an exciting piece of modern musical theater occurring before the event&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; declaring that the &quot;rock-symphonic synthesis [was] ripe with sophistication and hummable tunes&quot;.

The album became a Top 10 hit in the UK, West Germany and South Africa, reached #47 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, #39 in France, #35 in Australia, and for seven weeks remained at #1 on the Swedish album chart due in no small part to the composers&#x27; Swedish heritage. The recording also received several prestigious awards, including the Goldene Europa from Germany, the Edison Award from the Netherlands, and the Rockbjörn from Sweden.

=== History of the original West End production (1986–1989) ===
&quot;Chess&quot; premiered in London&#x27;s West End on 14 May 1986 at the Prince Edward Theatre. The original production was originally set to be directed by Michael Bennett, but after casting the show and commissioning the expansive set and costume designs, he withdrew from the project for health reasons and died on 2 July 1987 from AIDS-related lymphoma. Trevor Nunn, who had directed the musicals &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, took over as director. Set designer Robin Wagner later told Lynn Pecktal, author of the book &quot;Set Design&quot;, that Bennett had planned a &quot;multimedia&quot; show, with an elaborate tilting floor, banks of television monitors, and other technological touches. Nunn applied his realistic style to the show instead, although the basics of the mammoth set design were still present in the final production. These included three video walls, the main of which featured commentary from chess master William Hartston, and appearances from various BBC newsreaders rounding out the package. Costs were estimated at up to $12 million.

The London version expanded the storyline of the concept album, adding considerable new recitative. The three principal singers from the concept album, Elaine Paige, Tommy Körberg and Murray Head reprised their roles on stage. Barbara Dickson was unable to appear, and Siobhán McCarthy played the part of Svetlana, and the cast also featured Anthony Head, Grainne Renihan, Ria Jones, David Burt and Peter Karrie, during its three-year run. The show won the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for Best Musical and received three 1986 Laurence Olivier Award nominations for Best Musical, Outstanding Performance by an Actor (Tommy Körberg) and Outstanding Performance by an Actress (Elaine Paige). The production closed on 8 April 1989.

==== Critical reception ====
The premiere of the musical provoked an overall mixed to favourable verdict from the critics and, according to &quot;Variety&quot;, created &quot;one of the bigger West End mob scenes in recent memory&quot;. Most of the naysaying notices had comments ranging from &quot;far too long&quot; and &quot;shallow, improbable story masquerading as a serious musical&quot; from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; conclusion that, &quot;A musical is only as good as its book, and here one is confronted by an inchoate mess.&quot; Other newspapers posted rave reviews however. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that the show was &quot;gift-wrapped and gorgeous...compels admiration&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; noted that &quot;it turns out to be a fine piece of work that shows the dinosaur mega-musical evolving into an intelligent form of life&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; called it &quot;gripping, eye-catching.. nearly a major triumph&quot;. In addition, Michael Ratcliffe wrote in &quot;Observer&quot; that the &quot;operetta plot which would have delighted a mature Lehar is dramatised in a buoyant, eclectic and stirring theatre-score&quot; and called Körberg &quot;the indisputable star of the show&quot;. Sheridan Morley in &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; complimented the show&#x27;s &quot;remarkably coherent dramatic shape&quot; and &quot;staging of considerable intelligence and invention&quot;.

=== Plot summary ===

==== Act 1 ====
The president of the International Chess Federation—the Arbiter—speculates on the origins of the game of chess (&quot;Story of Chess&quot;) before announcing the location of the upcoming world chess championship: Merano, Italy. As the townsfolk prepare for the occasion (&quot;Merano&quot;), the current world champion, Freddie Trumper of the United States, arrives with his second and presumed lover: Hungarian-born, English-raised Florence Vassy (&quot;Freddie&#x27;s Entrance&quot;). Florence confronts Freddie about his brash behavior and rocky relationship with the press (&quot;Commie Newspapers&quot;), which immediately gets out of hand when he assaults a journalist who questions his relationship with Florence (&quot;Press Conference&quot;). Meanwhile, Freddie&#x27;s Soviet Russian challenger, Anatoly Sergievsky, argues with his own second, the scheming Molokov (&quot;Anatoly and Molokov&quot;). Afterwards, in private, Anatoly cynically reflects on the selling out of his dreams to get to where he is today (&quot;Where I Want to Be&quot;).

The opening ceremony features the American and Soviet delegates each vowing their side will win (&quot;Diplomats&quot;), the Arbiter insisting on a clean game (&quot;The Arbiter&quot;), and marketers looking to make a profit (&quot;Hymn to Chess&quot; / &quot;Merchandisers&quot;). During the increasingly intense match, Freddie suddenly throws the chessboard to the floor and storms out of the arena (&quot;Chess #1&quot;), leaving Florence to negotiate with Anatoly, Molokov, and the Arbiter (&quot;Quartet&quot;). Florence manages to arrange a meeting between the two players, after trading heated words with Molokov. It turns out that Freddie engineered the outburst in the hopes of extracting more money from his sponsor, an American sensationalist media company called Global Television, though Walter—the company&#x27;s representative in Freddie&#x27;s delegation—criticizes the stunt as ludicrous (&quot;Florence and Molokov&quot;). Florence later scolds Freddie, and they fight about the politics of the tournament until he viciously turns the argument toward her missing father, believed captured or killed by Soviet forces during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution (&quot;1956: Budapest is Rising&quot;). She laments the situation alone (&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Side&quot;) before heading off to the Merano Mountain Inn for the reconciliatory meeting she has scheduled between Freddie and Anatoly (&quot;Der Kleine Franz&quot;). Freddie does not immediately turn up, though, leaving Anatoly and Florence awkwardly alone together; however, they eventually embrace as romantic feelings arise before being finally interrupted by Freddie, who was working out new financial terms with Global TV (&quot;Mountain Duet&quot;).

The chess match proceeds. Distracted by the loss of Florence&#x27;s love, however, Freddie flounders, leaving himself just one more loss away from losing his title (&quot;Chess #2&quot;). Due to Freddie&#x27;s atrocious attitude, Florence finally deserts him (&quot;Florence Quits&quot;), whereby Freddie ponders how his unhappy childhood left him the man he is today (&quot;Pity the Child&quot;). He sends the Arbiter a letter of resignation, resulting in Anatoly becoming the new world champion. Anatoly immediately defects from the Soviet Union and seeks asylum at the British embassy (&quot;Defection&quot; / &quot;Embassy Lament&quot;). Florence, accompanying Anatoly, reflects on their newfound romance (&quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot;). Meanwhile, Walter tips off the press about this scandal. When the mob of reporters ambush Anatoly and ask why he is deserting his country (&quot;Anatoly and the Press&quot;), he tells them that he will never truly leave his homeland. (&quot;Anthem&quot;).

==== Act 2 ====
A year later, Anatoly is set to defend his championship in Bangkok, Thailand (&quot;Golden Bangkok&quot;). Freddie is already there, chatting up locals and experiencing the Bangkok nightlife (&quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot;); he is Global TV&#x27;s official commentator for the match. Florence and Anatoly are now openly lovers, and worry about Freddie&#x27;s sudden reappearance as well as the impending arrival of Anatoly&#x27;s estranged wife, Svetlana, from Russia (&quot;One More Opponent&quot; / &quot;You and I&quot;), which Anatoly suspects is part of Molokov&#x27;s plan to shame him into returning to the Soviet Union. Molokov, meanwhile, has trained a new protégé, Leonid Viigand, to challenge, defeat, and humiliate Anatoly (&quot;The Soviet Machine&quot;).

Walter, now Freddie&#x27;s boss, manipulates Freddie into embarrassing Anatoly on live TV during an eventually heated interview between them (&quot;The Interview&quot;). Molokov, who indeed is responsible for Svetlana&#x27;s presence in Bangkok, blackmails her into urging Anatoly to throw the match. Walter, who has been promised the release of certain captured American agents if he can ruin Anatoly&#x27;s performance, informs Florence that her father is still alive though imprisoned, and that he too will be released if she can convince Anatoly to lose. Despite Molokov and Walter&#x27;s efforts, none of their ploys work to get Anatoly to throw the game. As a result, Molokov and Walter team up to get Freddie to personally persuade Anatoly and Florence, knowing that Freddie is vengeful toward Anatoly and interested in winning back the love of Florence; however, Freddie&#x27;s attempts also fail (&quot;The Deal&quot;).

Surprisingly, Svetlana and Florence end up bonding over their respective relationships with Anatoly. Florence ultimately admits that it would be best for Anatoly to return to his children and Svetlana, while Svetlana accepts that Anatoly has long fallen out of love with her (&quot;I Know Him So Well&quot;). Anatoly, meanwhile, follows an anonymous letter guiding him to Wat Pho, where Freddie appears to tell him that he is willing to put their conflict behind him. Having decided that he only wants Anatoly to &quot;be true to the game&quot;, Freddie informs Anatoly of a significant flaw in Viigand&#x27;s strategy that will help Anatoly win (&quot;Talking Chess&quot;).

In the deciding game of the match, with the score tied at five games all, Svetlana castigates Anatoly for wallowing in the crowd&#x27;s empty praise and Florence expresses similar annoyance with him for casting aside his ideals; regardless, Anatoly achieves a superb victory against Viigand (&quot;Endgame&quot;). Later, Florence confesses her feelings that he should return to his family in the Soviet Union. The pair reflects on the conclusion of their romance (&quot;You and I: Reprise&quot;).

===Epilogue===
Walter later approaches Florence with the news that Anatoly has defected back to the USSR, meaning that her father will certainly be released. He startlingly admits, however, that no one actually knows if her father is still alive. Florence breaks down, realising that she too has been used, and she sadly mirrors Anatoly&#x27;s earlier sentiment that her only borders lie around her heart (&quot;Anthem: Reprise&quot;).

==American stage version==

=== History of the original Broadway production (1988) ===
After the West End production, the creative team decided to reimagine the show from the top down, leading to a second major stage version of the musical intended for American audiences, with considerable differences from the British version in both plot and music. Trevor Nunn brought in playwright Richard Nelson to recreate the musical as a straightforward &quot;book show&quot; for Broadway audiences. Nunn brought in new, younger principals after he disqualified Paige from the role of Florence by insisting Nelson recreate the character as an American. The story changed drastically, with different settings, characters, and many different plot elements, although the basic plot remained the same. Benny Andersson told &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;The main difference between London and here is that in London there is only about two or three minutes of spoken dialog. Here, in order to clarify some points, it is almost one-third dialog&quot;. The score was reordered, and comparisons of the Broadway cast recording and the original concept album reveal the dramatic extent of the changes. Robin Wagner designed a new set, which featured mobile towers that shifted continuously throughout the show, in an attempt to give it a sense of cinematic fluidity.

The first preview on 11 April 1988 ran 4 hours with a 90-minute intermission (the stage crew reportedly had problems with the sets); by opening night on 28 April, it was down to 3 hours 15 minutes. But despite a healthy box-office advance, the Broadway production did not manage to sustain a consistently large audience and closed on 25 June, after 17 previews and 68 regular performances. &quot;And there I was, on closing night, singing and sobbing along&quot;, later wrote &quot;Time&quot; magazine critic Richard Corliss. Overall, the show (capitalized at $6 million) since its opening, according to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;has been doing moderate business, mainly on the strength of theater party advances&quot;. Gerald Schoenfeld, co-producer of the show, noted: &quot;The musical had been playing to about 80 percent capacity, which is considered good, but about 50 percent of the audience have held special, half-priced tickets. If we filled the house at 100 percent at half price, we&#x27;d go broke and I haven&#x27;t seen any surge of tourist business yet this season. The show needs a $350,000 weekly gross to break even, but only a few weeks since its April 28 opening have reached that... You have to consider what your grosses are going to be in the future&quot;.

The Broadway production was nominated for several major awards. It got five nods from the Drama Desk Awards: Outstanding Actor in a Musical (David Carroll), Outstanding Actress in a Musical (Judy Kuhn), Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (Harry Goz), Outstanding Music (Andersson and Ulvaeus) and Outstanding Lighting Design (David Hersey). Carroll and Kuhn also received Tony Award nominations in Leading Actor in a Musical and Leading Actress in a Musical categories. None of the nominations resulted in a win, but Philip Casnoff received a 1988 Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance. The Original Broadway Cast recording of the musical was nominated for the 1988 Grammy Award in the category Best Musical Cast Show Album (won by &quot;Into the Woods&quot;).

Later, the musical developed a cult following based primarily on the score (Frank Rich noted in his book &quot;Hot Seat&quot; that &quot;the score retains its devoted fans&quot;), while Nelson&#x27;s book received more mixed notices. Many attempts were made to fix the Broadway version&#x27;s perceived problems. In 2001, in an interview with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Tim Rice admitted that after the &quot;comparative failure of &quot;Chess,&quot; his all-time favourite, he became disillusioned with theatre.&quot; He commented, &quot;It may sound arrogant, but &quot;Chess&quot; is as good as anything I&#x27;ve ever done. And maybe it costs too much brainpower for the average person to follow it&quot;.

==== Critical reception ====

Many critics panned the show, most notably Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; who wrote that &quot;the evening has the theatrical consistency of quicksand&quot; and described it as &quot;a suite of temper tantrums, [where] the characters ... yell at one another to rock music&quot;. Howard Kissel of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; complained that &quot;the show is shrilly overamplified&quot; and &quot;neither of the love stories is emotionally involving&quot;, while &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine called the show a &quot;Broadway&#x27;s monster&quot; and opined that &quot;Chess assaults the audience with a relentless barrage of scenes and numbers that are muscle-bound with self-importance&quot;.

A few reviewers, however, praised it highly. William A. Henry III wrote an exceptionally sympathetic review in &quot;Time&quot;: &quot;Clear narrative drive, Nunn&#x27;s cinematic staging, three superb leading performances by actors willing to be complex and unlikeable and one of the best rock scores ever produced in the theater. This is an angry, difficult, demanding and rewarding show, one that pushes the boundaries of the form&quot; (Time, 9 May 1988). His sentiments were echoed by William K. Gale in &quot;Providence Journal&quot;: &quot;A show with a solid, even wonderfully old-fashioned story that still has a bitter-sweet, rough-edged view of the world ... exciting, dynamic theater ... a match of wit and passion.&quot;

Richard Christiansen of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; suggested that &quot;&quot;Chess&quot; falters despite new strategy&quot;, yet concluded his review: &quot;Audiences forgive a lot of failings when they find a show that touches them with its music, and &quot;Chess&quot;, clumsy and overblown as it sometimes is in its three hours-plus running time, gives them that heart&quot;. Welton Jones wrote in &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; that &quot;Chess&quot; &quot;has one of the richest, most exciting scores heard on Broadway in years ... Sadly, the music has been encumbered with an overwritten book and an uninspired staging ... Truly, this is a score to be treasured, held ransom by a questionable book and production&quot;.

All critics agreed, though, on the three leading performances by Judy Kuhn, David Carroll and Philip Casnoff. They were showered with praise – &quot;splendid and gallant&quot; (&quot;Newsweek&quot;), &quot;powerful singers&quot; (&quot;The New York Times&quot;), &quot;remarkably fine&quot; (&quot;New York Post&quot;) – especially Kuhn, whose performance &quot;Variety&quot; called a &quot;show&#x27;s chief pleasure&quot;.

Benny Andersson commented in &quot;Variety&quot; on the negative Broadway reviews: &quot;I really don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t like it. ... I do know that most of the audiences so far stand up and cheer for everyone at the end. They appear to get emotionally involved with the show, and they really like it.&quot;

=== Synopsis ===
The musical&#x27;s American incarnation has noticeably different settings, lyrics, song orders, and a completely different Act 2 from the British version. In particular, in the American &quot;Chess&quot; the entire show is about one chess match, not two. Act 1 involves the first part of the match, which is held in Bangkok, Thailand, while Act 2 handles the conclusion, and is set in Budapest, Hungary. Also, the incumbent champion is switched in the American version (that is, to Anatoly Sergievsky rather than Freddie Trumper) as is the winner of the Sergievsky–Trumper tournament.

==== Prologue ====
In 1956, a Hungarian revolutionary, Gregor Vassy, calmly explains to his 4-year-old daughter, Florence, the history of chess, before the two are separated in the midst of a violent rebellion in Budapest (&quot;Prologue&quot; / &quot;The Story of Chess&quot;).

==== Act 1 ====
Decades later at an international chess tournament in Bangkok, Thailand, the wild-tempered American challenger, Freddie Trumper, arrives with his second and presumed lover: a now-adult Florence (&quot;Freddie&#x27;s Entrance&quot;). At a press meeting, Freddie loses his temper with the reporters as Florence scolds them for their sensationalism (&quot;Press Conference&quot;). The current world champion, a Soviet Russian named Anatoly Sergievsky, discusses this with his second, Molokov. Afterwards, in private, Anatoly cynically reflects on how his career as world champion has been characterized by empty fame (&quot;Where I Want to Be&quot;). Meanwhile, Florence grows frustrated with Freddie&#x27;s seedy financial agent, Walter, and complains to Freddie that her intellectual capabilities are under-appreciated (&quot;Argument&quot;).

The opening ceremony features merchandise vendors and Walter relishing in the tournament&#x27;s money-making opportunities (&quot;Merchandisers&quot;); the American and Soviet delegates each vowing their side will win (&quot;Diplomats&quot;); and the beginning of the tournament&#x27;s first round (&quot;Chess #1&quot;). When Anatoly begins eating yogurt during the match, Freddie accuses him of cheating before storming out of the arena, leaving Florence to negotiate with the tournament&#x27;s Arbiter, Molokov, and Anatoly, eventually promising to retrieve Freddie (&quot;Quartet&quot;). Florence later scolds Freddie, and they fight about the tournament&#x27;s politics until he viciously turns the argument toward her missing father (&quot;The American and Florence&quot;); alone, Florence begins to realize her need to abandon Freddie (&quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot;).

Instead of heading off to the Generous Sole restaurant for the reconciliatory meeting Florence has scheduled between Freddie and Anatoly, Freddie is sidetracked by the Bangkok nightlife (&quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot;), leaving Anatoly and Florence awkwardly alone together; however, they eventually embrace as romantic feelings arise before being finally interrupted by Freddie (&quot;Terrace Duet&quot; / &quot;Who&#x27;d Ever Think It?&quot;). Anatoly apologizes for the yogurt incident and Freddie returns to the match, but only after a hefty bribe. Distracted by the loss of Florence&#x27;s love, however, Freddie flounders, finishing the most recent round with one win and five losses; one more loss will cost him the match (Chess #2). Furious, he blames his issues on Florence, who finally leaves him as he reflects on his stature (&quot;Florence Quits&quot; / &quot;A Taste of Pity&quot;). Florence contemplates her new freedom from Freddie (&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Side&quot;), while Walter secretly arranges for Anatoly to defect from the Soviet Union to the United States. When a mob of reporters ambush Anatoly and ask about his newfound relationship with Florence and why he is deserting his country (&quot;Reporters&quot;), he tells them that he will never truly leave his homeland (&quot;Anthem&quot;).

==== Act 2 ====
Eight weeks later, everyone is in Budapest to witness the conclusion of the match between Anatoly and Freddie (&quot;The Arbiter&quot; / &quot;Hungarian Folk Song&quot;). Florence is elated to be back in her hometown, but dismayed that she remembers none of it (&quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot;). Molokov offers to help her find her missing father and starts &quot;investigating&quot;. Freddie, under protestations from Walter, is confident that he will win (&quot;Winning&quot;). Florence and Anatoly are now openly lovers, though their relationship is complicated by the arrival of Svetlana, Anatoly&#x27;s estranged wife, in Budapest (&quot;You and I&quot;). Anatoly discovers that Molokov is threatening his brother&#x27;s family to get him to return to Russia and begins to break down, losing a string of matches and leaving the score tied at five games all (&quot;Freddie Goes Metal&quot;). Molokov and Walter, interested in exchanging key individuals for their respective countries, collaborate to achieve their separate goals (&quot;Let&#x27;s Work Together&quot;), and Molokov reveals to Walter that Florence&#x27;s father is alive in Budapest, who in turn reveals this to Florence. Pressured by this information and the strain on her relationship with Anatoly, Florence turns to Svetlana for solace (&quot;I Know Him So Well&quot;). Anatoly, having heard the news of Florence&#x27;s father, cannot focus on the match at hand, and so Florence asks Freddie for a postponement, but he refuses and breaks down on live television, reflecting how his broken childhood made him who he is today (&quot;Pity the Child&quot;). In the meantime, Molokov brings Florence to see a man claiming to be her father and the two joyously reconnect (&quot;Father&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;).

In the deciding game of the match, Anatoly resolves to ensure that Florence is reunited with her father. He thus chooses to recant his defection and makes a tactical error during the game. Freddie immediately takes advantage of the blunder and proceeds to win the tournament, becoming the new world champion (&quot;Endgame&quot;). Florence and Anatoly reflect on the conclusion of their romance (&quot;You and I: Reprise&quot;). 
===Epilogue===
Florence is left alone to wait for her father when she is approached by Walter, who confesses that the old man is not her father, who is most likely dead. It seems that Molokov struck a deal with Walter that if the Russians managed to get Anatoly back, they would release a captured American spy; using Florence, they succeeded. Florence has now left Freddie, been abandoned by Anatoly, and lost the father she never had, realising that she too has been used, and she sadly mirrors Anatoly&#x27;s earlier sentiment that her only borders lie around her heart (&quot;Anthem: Reprise&quot;).

== Revivals, concerts, and recordings ==

=== 1989: Carnegie Hall and Sweden ===
Soon after the show closed on Broadway, a concert version was performed in January 1989 at Carnegie Hall by the original cast in a sold-out benefit performance. In September of that year, Judy Kuhn, and two principals from the West End production (Körberg and Head), gave concerts of the musical in Skellefteå, Sweden, during the finals of the 1989 chess World Cup tournament.

=== 1990s ===
The seven-month-long 1990 American tour acknowledged the ending of the Cold War. The tour starred Carolee Carmello, John Herrera, and Stephen Bogardus and was staged by Des McAnuff. Playwright Robert Coe worked with McAnuff on revising the show, mostly using the Nelson script and restoring most of the original song order from the British version of the musical and deleting the new songs written for the American version. A UK tour starring Rebecca Storm and mostly based on the London production, was a bigger success.

Once the Soviet Union fell, the modernization attempts died out: A Tim Rice rewrite played a brief run off Broadway in 1992 and set the show back to 1972. In 1990, a production was staged at the Marriott Theatre in Lincolnshire, Illinois. Directed by David H. Bell and starring Susie McMonagle, David Studwell and Kim Strauss, it featured another reworking of the Nelson script.

A 1990 production in Sydney, Australia, directed by Jim Sharman, was a critical and popular success at the Theatre Royal. It used a new version of the book rewritten primarily by Rice to streamline the plot, using parts from each of the previous versions, as well as his original conception for the American version. It starred Jodie Gillies as Florence, David McLeod as Frederick, and Robbie Krupski as Anatoly, and featured John Wood as Alexander, David Whitney as Walter, Laurence Clifford as the Arbiter, and Maria Mercedes as Svetlana. The action was shifted to an international hotel in Bangkok during the chess championships. No cast recording was made of this version. Both acts took place at a single chess match in a single city (Bangkok) in the late 1980s. Florence&#x27;s nationality was changed from Hungarian to Czech, with an accompanying change in the lyrics of &quot;The American and Florence&quot; from &quot;Budapest is rising&quot; to &quot;Prague and Mr. Dubček&quot;. The shift in time also led to a considerably different atmosphere, and a line changed in &quot;Embassy Lament&quot; addressing the fall of the Berlin Wall. As in the British version, Anatoly defects from the Soviet Union, wins the match, then decides to return to the Soviet Union at the end, leading to the possibility that Florence&#x27;s father, if he is still alive, will be released from prison. Many of the numbers from the British version were lengthened considerably, with an extended &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot; near the top of the show. &quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot; ended the first act, with &quot;Anthem&quot; and &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot; (sung by Svetlana with new lyrics) in the second. &quot;The Soviet Machine&quot; and &quot;The Deal&quot; were also extended considerably. A later Australian production played at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, in 1997, with Barbara Dickson as Florence (she had sung Svetlana on the original studio cast album). Co-stars included Derek Metzger and Daryl Braithwaite.

In 1992, there was a production directed by Rob Marshall staged at Paper Mill Playhouse. The production starred Steve Blanchard as the American, Judy McLane as Florence, Keith Rice as the Russian, David Cryer as Molokov, P. J. Benjamin as Walter, John DeLuca as the Arbiter, and Susan Dawn Carson as Svetlana.

In 1994, Chess in Concert toured cities in Sweden. The songs and lyrics were largely identical to the original album, with the addition of &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot; from the American version and &quot;The Soviet Machine&quot; from the British version. The cast included Anders Glenmark as Frederick, Karin Glenmark as Florence, and Tommy Körberg as Anatoly. A concert performance at Eriksbergshallen in Gothenburg was recorded.

In 1995, a Los Angeles production at Hollywood&#x27;s Hudson Theater received critical praise. It starred Douglas Sills as Freddie, Marcia Mitzman (who played Svetlana in the first Broadway production) as Florence and Sean Smith as Anatoly. For their performances both Mitzman and Smith won an Ovation Award and a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award. &quot;Chess&quot; toured in the UK in 1996. The cast included Jacqui Scott, and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Side&quot; was used as the finale.

In 1996-1997 elements of &quot;Chess&quot; were incorporated in the Russian Mossovet Theatre musical &quot;Igra&quot;, along with other songs of Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, The Beatles, and other hits of 1960-80s. Russian lyrics were penned by Yaroslav Kesler, who also worked on Mossovet&#x27;s staging of Jesus Christ Superstar. &quot;Igra&quot; in general was presented as follow up to the famous rock-opera and featured mostly same group of artists and producers, but survived just one season.

=== 2000 to 2009 ===
A Danish tour began in 2001. The English-language version starred mostly British principals, directed by Craig Revel Horwood. A two-CD album was released, titled &quot;Chess: Complete Cast Album&quot;, the only major complete recording of the British version of the musical (plus the addition of the American version&#x27;s &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot; for Svetlana in Act 2). The production also followed the British version of the plot, though later performances used a much shorter, trimmed-down version closer to the original concept album. The cast included Zubin Varla as Frederick, Emma Kershaw as Florence, Stig Rossen as Anatoly, Simon Clark as Alexander, and James Graeme as Walter, Gunilla Backman as Svetlana, and Michael Cormick as the Arbiter.

A 2002 Swedish-language version, &quot;Chess på svenska&quot;, with lyrics and book by Björn Ulvaeus, Lars Rudolffson, and Jan Mark, attempted to streamline the story back to its original form and eliminate political aspects. It featured new musical numbers (Svetlana&#x27;s &quot;Han är en man, han är ett barn&quot; (&quot;He is a man, he is a child&quot;) and Molokov&#x27;s &quot;Glöm mig om du kan&quot; (&quot;Forget me if you can&quot; from the demo song &quot;When The Waves Roll Out to Sea&quot;)) and focused on material from the concept album. Cast members included Tommy Körberg, reprising his role as Anatolij, Helen Sjöholm as Florence, Josefin Nilsson as Svetlana, Anders Ekborg as Freddie and Per Myrberg as Alexander. It was filmed for Swedish television, and has been released on a Swedish-language DVD. It was nominated for eight national Swedish Theatre Awards Guldmasken, winning six, including Best Leading Actress (Sjöholm), Best Leading Actor (Körberg), and Best Stage Design (Robin Wagner). The cast CD &quot;Chess På Svenska&quot; peaked at number 2 on the Swedish album chart.

An Actors Fund of America Benefit Concert was given in 2003 in the New Amsterdam Theater on Broadway. It was produced without set or costume changes, and with the orchestra onstage. The show was a combination of both the American and British versions, mostly following the British version with regard to music but the American version with regard to the plot, though the American version&#x27;s subplot with Florence&#x27;s father was cut. Act 1 was set in Merano, and Act 2 was set in Bangkok, like in the British version. The show, which was recorded, was directed by Peter Flynn, choreographed by Christopher Gattelli and conducted by Seth Rudetsky. The cast included Adam Pascal as Frederick, Julia Murney as Florence, Josh Groban as Anatoly, Norm Lewis as Molokov, Jonathan Dokuchitz as Walter, Raúl Esparza as the Arbiter, and Sutton Foster as Svetlana.

The Estonian production premiered in 2006 at the theatre Vanemuine in Tartu. The cast included Koit Toome and Gerli Padar as Freddie and Florence, respectively.

A concert version was presented in 2007 at the Ford Amphitheatre, Los Angeles, California, mixing the British and American versions. The cast included Susan Egan as Svetlana, Kevin Earley as Anatoly, Ty Taylor as Freddie, Cindy Robinson as Florence, Thomas Griffith as Alexander, and Matthew Morrison as the Arbiter. The concert was directed by Brian Michael Purcell. A portion of the proceeds went to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. A German-language version premiered in 2008 at Staatsoperette Dresden. It ran two seasons until 2010.

In 2008, Heartaches and Warner Bros. Records produced a two-performance concert version of &quot;Chess in Concert&quot; together with the City of London Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Hugh Wooldridge at the Royal Albert Hall. This version, substantially adapted by Tim Rice and Hugh Wooldridge with additional new lyrics, including almost no dialogue or set, but otherwise substantially following the British version in plot and music, was recorded and released as a 2-CD cast album and DVD, both titled &quot;Chess in Concert&quot;. It was also broadcast on American PBS channels in June 2009. Tim Rice stated in the concert&#x27;s programme that this version of &quot;Chess&quot; is the &quot;official version&quot;, after years of different plot and song combinations. Though the plot and score is almost entirely based on that of the British version, this version also adds in two American-originated songs: &quot;Prologue&quot; and &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot;. The cast included Adam Pascal as Frederick, Idina Menzel as Florence, Josh Groban as Anatoly, Kerry Ellis as Svetlana, Marti Pellow as the Arbiter, David Bedella as Molokov, and Clarke Peters as Walter. The Civil Servants (in &quot;Embassy Lament&quot;) were sung by Cantabile

In 2009, the first official Italian production (in Italian language) took place in Firenze, then replicated in Prato (2010), Campi Bisenzio-FI (2011), and Siena (2011). The cast included Alberto Putignano/Emanuele Nardoni as Frederick, Irene Vavolo/Alessandra D&#x27;Onofrio as Florence, Piercarlo Ballo as Anatoly, Ilaria Bongini/Giulia Gazzeri as Svetlana, Riccardo Andreoni as the Arbiter, Maurizio Capuana as Molokov, and Matteo Gazzeri/Marco Davide Toci as Walter. Direction by Piercarlo Ballo.

=== 2010 to 2019 ===
A Hungarian revival of &quot;Chess&quot; ran in 2010 in Budapest. This concert production closely followed the script of the Royal Albert Hall production of 2008, though the songs &quot;Hymn of Chess&quot;, &quot;The Merchandisers&quot;, &quot;The Arbiter&quot; (reprise) and &quot;Talking Chess&quot; were cut. It was produced by PS Produkció and directed by Cornelius Baltus. The Hungarian lyrics were written by Ágnes Romhányi and the choreographer was Karen Bruce. The first major American revival of &quot;Chess&quot; since 1993 ran at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia in 2010. The show followed the story of the American version, though it streamlined the book and reordered some of the songs. It was directed by Eric D. Schaeffer. The cast included Jeremy Kushnier as Freddie, Euan Morton as Anatoly, and Jill Paice as Florence.

A production directed by Craig Revel Horwood toured for 10 months in the UK, Italy and Ireland in 2010–2011. It was an actor-musician production, with 25 out of the 30 cast members playing instruments. Changes to the libretto included the removal of &quot;Merano&quot; and &quot;Walter and Florence&quot;. The cast included James Fox as Frederick, Shona White as Florence, Daniel Koek as Anatoly, Steve Varnom as Alexander, James Graeme as Walter, David Erik as the Arbiter, and Poppy Tierney as Svetlana. Mirvish Productions staged a Toronto run in 2011 at the Princess of Wales Theatre, following the UK tour, using most of the UK Tour cast with Tam Mutu taking over the role of Anatoly and Rebecca Lock as Svetlana. Changes to the libretto included the removal of &quot;The Merchandisers&quot;. Another German version (with the songs performed in English) was produced by the Theater Bielefeld (Municipal Theatre Bielefeld) in Bielefeld, Germany in 2011–2012.

A one-night concert was given at Lincoln Center, in New York in 2012, billed as &quot;Chess&quot; in Concept 2012: A benefit performance for the Actors Fund of America. The cast included Robert Cuccioli as Anatoly, Natascia Diaz as Florence, Drew Sarich as Frederick, and Tamra Hayden as Svetlana. This version returned to the original concept album for its musical structure, Tim Rice&#x27;s original scenario, and incorporated virtually all of the British score. It was produced and directed, and the score was arranged, by Christopher Martin.

A New Zealand production of &quot;Chess&quot; ran in 2012, in the Regent On Broadway, directed by Steven Sayer. The show was produced by the Abbey Musical Theatre. A 2012 Melbourne, Australia production was directed by Gale Edwards and mounted by The Production Company. The cast featured Martin Crewes as Frederick, Michael Falzon as the Arbiter, Silvie Paladino as Florence, and Simon Gleeson as Anatoly, It was staged at the State Theatre, backed by Orchestra Victoria. The role of the Arbiter was expanded slightly by sharing Florence&#x27;s song &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Side&quot;. The show ran for 10 performances and was nominated for twelve Green Room Awards in 2012, eventually winning seven. Chess was also nominated for two 2013 Helpmann Awards, with Paladino winning &quot;Actress in a Leading Role&quot;.

In 2012, the GöteborgsOperan (Gothenburg Opera, Sweden) ran the Swedish-language version, Chess på Svenska, under the direction of Mira Bartov. The musical ran until the Fall of 2013. The roles of Anatoly and Freddie were played by Philip Jalmelid and Christopher Wollter. Evelyn Jons played Florence and Nina Pressing played Svetlana.

East West Players staged a revival of the UK version of &quot;Chess&quot; with a multi-cultural cast in 2013 at the David Henry Hwang Theatre in Los Angeles, California, directed by Tim Dang. The production garnered a positive review from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

A South Korean production opened in 2015, with K-Pop stars Jo Kwon, CNU, Key, and Ken quadruple-cast as Anatoly.

Porchlight Music Theatre presented &quot;Chess&quot; as a part of their &quot;Porchlight Revisits&quot; season in which they present three forgotten musicals per year. It was in Chicago, Illinois in May 2016. It was directed by Artistic Director Michael Weber, choreographed by Brenda Didier, and music directed by Jimmy Morehead.

In 2017, a Swedish theatre group, UnderhållningsPatrullen, presented the Swedish-language version, Chess på Svenska, at the Kristianstad Theatre, with a premiere date of 23 September 2017. The production included a completely new orchestration by Anders Eljas involving a smaller orchestra, just 13 members as opposed to the usual 24 members, to introduce a new version for future productions better suited to smaller theatre venues. The roles of Anatoly, Florence, and Freddie were played by Johan Wikström, Frida Modén Treichl, and Patrik Martinsson. Hanna la Fleur performed as Svetlana, Peter Järnstedt plays Molokov, and David Rix plays Jean Jacques van Boren the Arbiter (chefsdomaren). Director: Ola Hörling, Conductor: Nils-Petter Ankarblom and subsequently Thomas Bay (Conductor), Producer: Åsa Jensen, Costume: Fredrika Liliius, Scenography: Leif Persson, Musical Instruction &amp; Pianist: Jonas Svensson. The Kristianstad production ran for an expanded schedule and finally closed in December 2017 after 47 shows.

A limited-run West End revival began at the London Coliseum on 26 April 2018 through 2 June 2018, officially opening on 1 May 2018. Billed as the first revival of the show in 30 years, the production was directed by Laurence Connor, with choreography by Stephen Mear. The cast included Michael Ball as Anatoly, Phillip Browne as Molokov, Alexandra Burke as Svetlana, Cedric Neal as the Arbiter, Tim Howar as Freddie and Cassidy Janson as Florence. Described as a new interpretation of the original concept album, the production kept the first act in Merano and the second in Bangkok, and included all songs from the concept album (including &quot;Argument&quot;), along with the popular &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot;, removed the character of Walter entirely, and dropped the final twist of Florence&#x27;s father never having been found after all, instead ending on the bittersweet parting of Florence and Anatoly amidst the triumphant crescendo of You And I.

On 20 June 2017, Tim Rice announced that after a recent table reading, a revival of the musical with a restructured storyline will be staged on Broadway in late 2018. The production featured a new book penned by Danny Strong and was directed by Michael Mayer. On 29 November, it was announced that the show would have a pre-Broadway tryout in the Eisenhower Theater at the Kennedy Center from 14 to 18 February 2018. The cast included Raúl Esparza as Freddie, Ramin Karimloo as Anatoly, Karen Olivo as Florence, Ruthie Ann Miles as Svetlana, Bradley Dean as Molokov, Sean Allan Krill as Walter de Courcey, and Bryce Pinkham as the Arbiter. This production, though keeping much of the original plot of the 1986 West End production, expanded on it significantly. Each act has a political background: Act One, set in 1979, centers on negotiations for the SALT-II treaty, and Act Two, set four years later, centers on suspicions surrounding the Able Archer 83 exercises. Walter no longer has a cover, and is openly a CIA agent. Freddie is portrayed as having paranoid schizophrenia, and the show ends with Florence&#x27;s father being released.

=== 2020 to present ===

&quot;Chess&quot; played at the Umeda Arts Theater Main Hall in Osaka, Japan (January 25–28) and at the Tokyo International Forum Hall C in Tokyo (February 1–9). Ramin Karimloo played Anatoly with Samantha Barks as Florence, Luke Walsh as Freddie, Takanori Sato as the Arbiter, Eliana as Svetlana, and Hideya Masuhara as Molokov. The ensemble included Megumi Iino, Hiroaki Ito, Takashi Otsuka, Kana Okamoto, Naoki Shibahara, Tatsunori Senna, Kota Someya, Tomohiko Nakai, Nanaka, Ai Ninomiya, Ami Norimatsu, Maaya Harada, Kan Muto, Daisuke Moriyama, Sayaka Watabiki, and Kiyoka Wada. THe show was directed and chroeographed by Nick Winston.

In February 2020, Oslo&#x27;s Folkteateret began previews for a new production based on &quot;Chess på svenska&quot;. This was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally opened on 24 August 2022. It starred André Søfteland as Anatolij, Espen Grjotheim as Freddie, Karoline Krüger as Florence, Marion Ravn as Svetlana, Øystein Røger as Molokov, and Elisabeth Andreassen as the Arbiter. On 7 July 2022, the production released a cast album.

On 17 October 2020, the first Russian production of Chess premiered at the MDM Theatre in Moscow. It was produced by Dmitriy Bogachov, the former head of Stage Entertainment Russia, founder of Moscow Broadway, and member of The Broadway League. The opening had been scheduled for 10 October, but was moved a week later. The cast included Aleksandr Sukhanov and Kirill Gordeev as Anatoly, Anastasia Stotskaya, Olga Belyaeva, and Yulia Iva as Florence, Aleksandr Kazmin and Aleksandr Bobrov as Freddie, Anna Guchenkova and Yulia Iva as Svetlana, Stanislav Belyaev and Denis Demkiv as the Arbiter, and Aleksandr Marakulin, Aleksandr Matrosov, and Andrey Shkoldychenko as Molokov. The lyrics were translated by Aleksei Ivaschenko (&quot;Nord-Ost&quot;, Russian versions of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;). The show was mostly based on the West End version, but took many cues from the original concept album. The prologue is set in Moscow, as in the Swedish version, and the rest of the show is set in Merano (Act I) and Bangkok (Act II). Walter was omitted and the songs &quot;Merchandisers&quot;, &quot;Florence and Molokov&quot;, &quot;Anatoly and the Press&quot;, &quot;One More Opponent&quot;, &quot;Talking Chess&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot; were removed. The song &quot;Argument&quot; was included. The chess games played on stage are actual historical chess games: Karpov-Korchnoi (1978) and Spassky-Fischer (1972) in Act I, and Karjakin-Caruana (2016) in Act II. Starting 7 April 2020, the omitted song &quot;Merchandisers&quot; was performed by the chorus in the theater lobby during intermission. The production closed on 16 October 2022, running for over 600 performances, making it the second-longest running professional production of the show, after only the original London production.

A semi-staged concert hall production toured Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane from April to June 2021. A cut-down version of the general plot of the original London version, changes included the movement of &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot; back to Act One and &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; before &quot;The Deal&quot;. It was accompanied by a 26 piece orchestra and 40 person choir. According to the musical director&#x27;s notes in the program, they tried to stay faithful to the sound, feel and spirit of the concept album, sourcing original keyboard and drum sounds. Although &quot;semi-staged&quot;, it had a small set consisting of a chess board with large pieces representing towns where the tournaments were held, and a dance ensemble, elaborate choreography and lighting.

A two-day concert based mostly on the London version was held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on August 1 and 2, 2022. The show starred Samantha Barks as Florence, Hadley Fraser as Anatoly, Joel Harper-Jackson as Freddie, Frances Mayli McCann as Svetlana, Ako Mitchell as the Arbiter, and Craige Els as Molokov. The show largely followed the plot of the London version, but cut several songs and added &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Story&quot; before &quot;Embassy Lament&quot;.

On 12 December 2022, a one-night benefit concert for the Entertainment Community Fund played at the Broadhurst Theatre. Ramin Karimloo reprised his role as Anatoly, joined by Darren Criss as Freddie, Lena Hall as Florence, and Solea Pfeiffer as Svetlana. Bradley Dean, Bryce Pinkham, and Sean Allan Krill reprised their roles of Molokov, The Arbiter, and Walter, respectively. The script used was a slightly revised version of the Kennedy Center book, mostly expanding on Freddie and Anatoly. Anatoly&#x27;s dissatisfaction with life in the Soviet Union was heightened to contemplating suicide and increased suspicion of Svetlana, and Freddie&#x27;s schizophrenia was changed to undiagnosed bipolar disorder. A plot point was also added where Florence and Anatoly had already met and had a brief affair at a previous tournament in Rome.

The Muny Opera Theatre in St. Louis staged &quot;Chess&quot; as part of their 105th season from July 5 to 11, 2023. The cast featured Jessica Vosk as Florence, Jarrod Spector as Freddie, John Riddle as Anatoly, Taylor Louderman as Svetlana, Rodney Hicks as Walter, Tally Sessions as Molokov, and Phillip Johnson Richardson as the Arbiter. The production was directed and choreographed by Josh Rhodes. The production stuck mostly to the plot of the original London version, but moved several songs around and added some new dialogue scenes. The production was sponsored by the Saint Louis Chess Club and the World Chess Hall of Fame, both located close to the theatre.

In December 2024, Rice revealed that he, Andersson and Ulvaeus were preparing a new Broadway production of the show, to open in 2025.

Tim Rice has always expressed his desire of adapting &quot;Chess&quot; for the big screen. In 2003, Kylie Minogue was in talks to play one of the two female parts. She met with Rice in Paris to discuss the script. Jude Law and Brendan Gleeson were discussed as male leads.

On 10 January 2022, on his podcast &quot;Get Onto My Cloud&quot;, Rice stated that in addition to a possible Broadway revival happening soon, he hopes for a film adaptation to follow suit, in part bolstered by the recent success of the chess-focused Netflix miniseries &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot;.

<text>Dendrobium is a genus of mostly epiphytic and lithophytic orchids in the family Orchidaceae. It is a very large genus, containing more than 1,800 species that are found in diverse habitats throughout much of south, east and southeast Asia, including China, Japan, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New Guinea, Vietnam and many of the islands of the Pacific. Orchids in this genus have roots that creep over the surface of trees or rocks, rarely having their roots in soil. Up to six leaves develop in a tuft at the tip of a shoot and from one to a large number of flowers are arranged along an unbranched flowering stem. Several attempts have been made to separate &quot;Dendrobium&quot; into smaller genera, but most have not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

==Description==
&quot;Dendrobium&quot; species are mostly epiphytic, or lithophytic although a few species are terrestrial. They are sympodial herbs with cylindrical roots usually arising from the base of a pseudobulb. The pseudobulbs, when present, are hard, sometimes cane-like, cylindrical or cone-shaped and more or less covered with the bases of the leaves. There are from one to many leaves arranged in two ranks, the leaves varying in shape from linear to oblong, sometimes cylindrical but never channelled or grooved. They are usually much longer than wide and last for only a single season.

Between one and a large number of resupinate or non-resupinate flowers are arranged along an unbranched flowering stem and may be short or long-lived. The flowers may be white, green, yellow, or pink to purple, often with contrasting colours in the labellum. The sepals and petals are usually free from and more or less similar to each other but markedly different from the labellum. The labellum is more or less egg-shaped, with the narrower end towards the base and flanks the column. There is often a callus consisting of narrow, parallel ridges, in the centre of the labellum.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Dendrobium&quot; was first formally described in 1799 by Olof Swartz and the description was published in &quot;Nova Acta Regiae Societatis Scientiarum Upsaliensis&quot;. The name &quot;Dendrobium&quot; is derived from the ancient Greek words &quot;dendron&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;bios&quot; meaning &quot;life&quot;, referring to the epiphytic habit of most species.

In 1981, Friedrich Brieger reclassified all terete-leaved dendrobiums from Australia and New Guinea into a new genus, &quot;Dockrillia&quot; and in 2002 David Jones and Mark Clements separated the genus into smaller genera, including &quot;Thelychiton&quot;, &quot;Tropilis&quot;, &quot;Vappodes&quot; and &quot;Winika&quot; but all of these genera are regarded as synonyms by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

===Sections===
The genus Dendrobium was first divided into sections for infrageneric classification by Rudolf Schlechter in 1911–1914 based on morphological characteristics. Later on DNA markers were used to define the sections from work by Yukawa and colleagues from 1993 through 2001.

==Distribution and habitat==
Orchids in the genus &quot;Dendrobium&quot; have adapted to a wide variety of habitats, from the high altitudes in the Himalayan mountains to lowland tropical forests and even to the dry climate of the Australian desert.

==Uses==
===Use in horticulture===

&quot;Dendrobium&quot; is abbreviated as Den. by the Royal Horticultural Society. Some species are in great demand by orchid lovers. This has resulted in numerous varieties and hybrids, such as the noble dendrobium (&quot;Den. nobile&quot;) breeds, which have greatly extended the range of colors of the original plant from the Himalayas. The flowers of &quot;Dendrobium stratiotes&quot; are known to remain fresh for nine months.

Many &quot;Dendrobium&quot; species are known to vigorously remove toluene and xylene from the air.

Several hybrids in this genus have been registered and named after notable persons and institutions:
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Ismail Sabri Yaakob
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Bae Yong-joon
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; SCCCI 100th Anniversary
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Margaret Thatcher
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Iriana Jokowi
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Joseph Schooling
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Yip Pin Xiu

The grex &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Berry gx has received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Medicinal uses===

Some &quot;Dendrobium&quot; species are cultivated as medicinal plants. The noble dendrobium (&quot;D. nobile&quot;) for example is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as &quot;shí hú&quot; () or &quot;shí hú lán&quot; ().

The 1889 book &#x27;The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that &quot;Dendrobium canaliculatum&quot; was called &quot;yamberin&quot; by the Indigenous People of Queensland, Australia and that &quot;The bulbous stems, after being deprived of the old leaves are edible (Thozet).&quot;

===In culture===
Many species and cultivars of this genus are well-known floral emblems and have been figured in artwork. Among the former are:
* &quot;Dendrobium formosum&quot; (beautiful giant-flowered dendrobium) – emblem of Ranong Province (Thailand)
* &quot;Dendrobium&quot; &#x27;Kim il Sung&#x27; (Kimilsungia) – emblem of North Korea
* &quot;Dendrobium moniliforme&quot; (Sekikoku) – emblem of Matsushima, Miyagi (Japan)
* &quot;Dendrobium nobile&quot; (noble dendrobium) – emblem of Sikkim (India)
* &quot;Dendrobium bigibbum&quot; (Cooktown orchid, &quot;anggrek larat&quot;) – emblem of Maluku province (Indonesia) and Queensland (Australia).
* &quot;Dendrobium utile&quot; (locally known as &quot;anggrek serat&quot;) – emblem of the Indonesian province of South East Sulawesi

The Cooktown orchid was figured on Australian stamps in 1968 and 1998, and flowers of several &quot;Dendrobium&quot; greges are depicted on the obverse side of the Singapore Orchid Series currency notes issued between 1967 and 1976:
* Dendrobium Marjorie Ho – S$10
* Dendrobium Shangri-La – S$500
* Dendrobium Kimiyo Kondo – S$1000

The golden-bow dendrobium (&quot;D. chrysotoxum&quot;), colloquially called fried-egg orchid was one of the species grown by the fictional private detective and orchid fancier Nero Wolfe, and plays a role in &quot;The Final Deduction&quot;.

<doc id="276145" wikidata="Q1952957" url="?curid=276145" title="Thunderball (novel)">
<text>Thunderball is the ninth book and the eighth novel in Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; series. It was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 27 March 1961. The first novelisation of an unfilmed James Bond screenplay, it was born from a collaboration by five people: Ian Fleming, Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, Ivar Bryce and Ernest Cuneo. The first edition was published under Fleming&#x27;s name, after which a legal case brought against him by McClory and Whittingham led to them being given writing credits.

The story centres on the theft of a pair of nuclear weapons by the crime organisation SPECTRE and the subsequent attempted blackmail of the Western powers for their return. James Bond of the Secret Service travels to the Bahamas to work with his friend Felix Leiter, who had been seconded back into the CIA for the investigation. &quot;Thunderball&quot; introduces SPECTRE&#x27;s leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in the first of three appearances in Bond novels, with &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;; the three novels are now known as the &quot;Blofeld trilogy&quot;.

&quot;Thunderball&quot; has been adapted four times: once in comic-strip format for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper, twice for the cinema and once for the radio. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; strip was cut short on the order of its owner, Lord Beaverbrook, after Ian Fleming signed an agreement with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to publish a short story. On screen, &quot;Thunderball&quot; was released in 1965 as the fourth film in the Eon Productions series, with Sean Connery as James Bond. The second adaptation, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, was released as an independent production in 1983 also starring Connery as Bond; it was produced by McClory. BBC Radio 4 aired an adaptation in December 2016, in which Toby Stephens played Bond.

==Plot==
During a meeting with his superior, M, the Secret Service agent James Bond learns that his latest physical assessment is poor because of excessive drinking and smoking. M sends Bond to a health clinic for a two-week treatment to improve his condition. At the clinic Bond encounters Count Lippe, a member of the Red Lightning Tong criminal organisation from Macau. When Bond learns of the Tong connection, Lippe tries to kill him by tampering with a spinal traction table on which Bond is being treated. Bond is saved by a nurse and later retaliates by trapping Lippe in a steam bath, causing second-degree burns and sending him to hospital for a week.
The Prime Minister receives a communiqué from SPECTRE (the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), a private criminal enterprise under the command of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. SPECTRE has hijacked a &quot;Villiers Vindicator&quot; aircraft and seized its two nuclear bombs, which it will use to destroy two major targets in the Western hemisphere unless a ransom is paid. Lippe was dispatched to the clinic to oversee Giuseppe Petacchi, an Italian Air Force pilot stationed at a nearby bomber squadron base, and post the communiqué once the bombs were in SPECTRE&#x27;s possession. Although Lippe has accomplished his tasks, they were delayed; Blofeld considers him unreliable because of his clash with Bond and has him killed.

Acting as a NATO observer of Royal Air Force procedure, Petacchi is being paid by SPECTRE to hijack the bomber in mid-flight by killing its crew and flying it to the Bahamas, where he ditches it in the ocean and it sinks in shallow water. SPECTRE kills Petacchi, camouflages the wreck and transfers the nuclear bombs onto the cruiser yacht &quot;Disco Volante&quot; for transport to an underwater hiding place. Emilio Largo, second-in-command of SPECTRE, oversees the operations.

The Americans and the British launch Operation Thunderball to foil SPECTRE and recover the two atomic bombs. On a hunch, M assigns Bond to the Bahamas to investigate. There, Bond meets his friend Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA from the Pinkerton detective agency because of the Thunderball crisis. While in Nassau, Bond meets Dominetta &quot;Domino&quot; Vitali, Largo&#x27;s mistress and Petacchi&#x27;s sister. She is living on board the &quot;Disco Volante&quot; and believes Largo is on a treasure hunt, although Largo makes her stay ashore while he and his partners supposedly survey the ocean for treasure. After seducing her, Bond informs her that Largo arranged her brother&#x27;s death and recruits her to spy on Largo. Domino re-boards the &quot;Disco Volante&quot; with a Geiger counter disguised as a camera, to ascertain if the yacht has been used to transport the bombs. She is discovered and Largo tortures her for information.

Bond and Leiter alert the Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo and join the crew of the American nuclear submarine &quot;Manta&quot; as the ransom deadline nears. The &quot;Manta&quot; chases the &quot;Disco Volante&quot; to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. Bond and Leiter lead a dive team in a fight against Largo&#x27;s crew and a battle ensues. Bond stops Largo from escaping with the bombs; Largo corners him in an underwater cave and is about to kill him, only to be killed by Domino with a shot from a spear gun. The fight leaves six American divers and ten SPECTRE men dead, including Largo, and the bombs are recovered safely. As Bond recuperates in hospital, Leiter explains that Domino told Largo nothing under torture and later escaped from the &quot;Disco Volante&quot; to get revenge on him. Learning that she is also recovering from injuries, Bond crawls into her room and falls asleep at her bedside.

==Background and writing history==

The author Ian Fleming had long considered the possibility of his literary creation James Bond appearing on screen, and he had been in discussion with the filmmaker Sir Alexander Korda about a version of the 1954 novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, although this came to nothing. In 1954 the American CBS television network paid Fleming $1,000 for the rights to turn his first novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, into a one-hour television adventure as part of the dramatic anthology series &quot;Climax Mystery Theater&quot;. In June 1956 the author began a collaboration with the television producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, &quot;Commander Jamaica&quot;, which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. The project foundered and Fleming used the plot as the basis for his 1958 novel &quot;Dr. No&quot;.

In mid-1958 Fleming and his friend Ivar Bryce began talking about the possibility of producing a film with Bond as the protagonist. At that time Fleming had published seven Bond novels in the preceding seven years. Bryce introduced Fleming to the writer and director Kevin McClory, who was making &quot;The Boy and the Bridge&quot; at the time. Bryce was part-financing the film, which was being produced through a partnership between Bryce and McClory under the name Xanadu Productions; the company was named after Bryce&#x27;s Bahamian home. Fleming suggested that &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1954) or &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; (1957) would be the best choices.

In May 1959 Fleming, Bryce, Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce&#x27;s Essex house and then in McClory&#x27;s London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called Fatima Blush. McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it. Over the next few months, as the story changed, there were ten outlines, treatments and scripts. Much of the attraction Fleming felt working alongside McClory was based on &quot;The Boy and the Bridge&quot;, which was the official British entry to the 1959 Venice Film Festival. When the film was released in July 1959, it was poorly received, and did not do well at the box office; Bryce and Fleming became disenchanted with McClory&#x27;s ability as a result. In October 1959, with Fleming spending less time on the film project, McClory introduced the experienced screenwriter Jack Whittingham to the writing team.

In November 1959 Fleming left to travel around the world on behalf of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, material for which he also used for his 1963 non-fiction travel book, &quot;Thrilling Cities&quot;. On his travels—through Japan, Hong Kong and into the US—Fleming met with McClory and Ivar Bryce in New York; McClory told Fleming that Whittingham had completed a full outline which, he said, was ready to shoot. Back in Britain in December 1959, Fleming met McClory and Whittingham for a script conference and shortly afterwards McClory and Whittingham sent him a script, &quot;Longitude 78 West&quot;, which Fleming considered to be good, although he changed the title to &quot;Thunderball&quot;.

Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January 1960; that month McClory visited him. Fleming explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA, with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer. Fleming also told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory&#x27;s involvement, then McClory should either try to persuade MCA to change their minds, back out of the deal or open an action in the courts.

===Writing===
Before Fleming left for Jamaica, he wrote to his friend and copy editor William Plomer that he was &quot;terribly stuck with James Bond. What was easy at 40 is very difficult at 50. I used to believe—sufficiently—in Bonds and blondes and bombs. Now the keys creak as I type and I fear the zest may have gone.&quot; Once at Goldeneye, Fleming struggled to find fresh ideas for the plot of his novel and he based it on the screenplay written by himself, Whittingham, McClory and Cuneo. Fleming had previously used his former scripts or treatments to form the basis of a novel, as he had done with the 1958 novel &quot;Dr. No&quot; and 1960 short stories &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; and &quot;Risico&quot;.

Fleming followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; magazine: &quot;I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour&#x27;s work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.&quot; On his return from Jamaica he wrote to Plomer with a copy of the manuscript:

You may say that it needs drastic re-writing. I certainly got thoroughly bored with it after a bit, and I have not even been able to re-read it, though I have just begun correcting the first chapters. They are not too bad—it is the last twenty chapters that glaze my eyes.

In addition to &quot;Longitude 78 West&quot;, other titles proposed for the novel included &quot;SPECTRE&quot; and &quot;James Bond of the Secret Service&quot;. The title &quot;Thunderball&quot; came from a conversation Fleming had about a US atomic test. Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have identified timelines based on episodes and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of &quot;Thunderball&quot; in 1959; Griswold is more precise and considers the story to have taken place between May and early June 1959.

===Plagiarism accusation and court case===
In March 1961 McClory read an advance copy of the book; within ten days he had decided to start legal proceedings for breach of copyright. He and Whittingham petitioned the High Court in London for an injunction to stop publication and the case was heard on 24 March. The judge, Mr Justice Wilberforce, allowed the book to be published as the publication date was so close and 32,000 copies were already with booksellers, although the door was left open for McClory to pursue further action at a later date. Two weeks after the case Fleming had a heart attack during a regular weekly meeting at his employers, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

On 19 November 1963 the case of &quot;McClory and Whittingham v Fleming, Jonathan Cape Ltd and Bryce&quot; was heard at the Chancery Division of the High Court; it lasted three weeks. Fleming&#x27;s health had been poor for a while and he suffered two heart attacks while the case was running. Under advice from Bryce, Fleming settled out of court. McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay, and Fleming was given the rights to the novel, although it had to be recognised as being &quot;based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author&quot;. On settlement, Fleming admitted &quot;&#x27;that the novel reproduces a substantial part of the copyright material in the film scripts&#x27;; &#x27;that the novel makes use of a substantial number of the incidents and material in the film scripts&#x27;; and &#x27;that there is a general similarity of the story of the novel and the story as set out in the said film scripts&#x27;&quot;. On 12 August 1964, nine months after the trial ended, Fleming suffered another heart attack and died aged 56.

====Script elements====
When the script was first drafted in May 1959 with the storyline of an aeroplane of celebrities in the Atlantic, it included elements from Fleming&#x27;s friend Ernie Cuneo, among which were ships with underwater trapdoors in their hulls and an underwater battle scene. The Russians were originally the villains, then the Sicilian Mafia, but this was later changed again to the international criminal organisation, SPECTRE. Both McClory and Fleming claimed to have come up with the concept of SPECTRE; Fleming&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lycett and Robert Sellers, who wrote a history of the &quot;Thunderball&quot; controversy, both consider Fleming as the originator of the group, Lycett saying that &quot;[Fleming] proposed that Bond should confront not the Russians but SPECTRE&quot;, and Sellers finding SPECTRE Fleming&#x27;s &quot;most significant contribution to the entire &quot;Thunderball&quot; story-line&quot;. Fleming described SPECTRE as &quot;an immensely powerful organisation armed by ex-members of SMERSH, the Gestapo, the Mafia and the Black Tong of Peking ...[which was] placing these bombs in NATO bases with the objective of blackmailing the Western powers for £100 million or else&quot;.

Sellers notes that Fleming had used the word &quot;spectre&quot; previously: in the fourth novel, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;; for a town near Las Vegas called &quot;Spectreville&quot;; and the cryptograph decoder in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; called the &quot;spektor&quot;. Those elements which can be put down to McClory and Whittingham (either separately or together) include the airborne theft of a nuclear bomb, &quot;Jo&quot; Petachi and his sister Sophie, and Jo&#x27;s death at the hands of Sophie&#x27;s boss. The remainder of the screenplay was a two-year collaboration among Fleming, Whittingham, McClory, Bryce and Cuneo.

==Development==
===Inspirations===
As with the previous novels in the Bond series, aspects of &quot;Thunderball&quot; come from Fleming&#x27;s own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm near Godalming, and Bond&#x27;s medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming&#x27;s own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken from that of a house owned by the parents of his wife&#x27;s friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.
Bond&#x27;s examination of the hull of &quot;Disco Volante&quot; was inspired by the ill-fated mission undertaken on 19 April 1956 by &quot;Buster&quot; Crabb, the ex-Royal Navy frogman, on behalf of MI6. He examined the hull of the that had brought Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin on a diplomatic mission to Britain. Crabb disappeared in Portsmouth Harbour and was never seen again. As well as having Crabb in mind, Fleming would also recall the information about the 10th Light Flotilla, an elite unit of Italian navy frogmen who used wrecked ships in Gibraltar to launch attacks on Allied shipping. The specifications for &quot;Disco Volante&quot; had been obtained by Fleming from the Italian ship designer, Leopold Rodriguez.

As often happened in Fleming&#x27;s novels, several names were taken from those of people he had known. Blofeld&#x27;s name comes from Tom Blofeld, a Norfolk farmer and a fellow member of Fleming&#x27;s gentlemen&#x27;s club Boodle&#x27;s; Tom was a contemporary of Fleming&#x27;s at Eton. When Largo rents his beachside villa, it is from &quot;an Englishman named Bryce&quot;, whose name was taken from Ivar Bryce, and Largo&#x27;s beachside villa was based on Bryce&#x27;s Jamaican property Xanadu.

Other names used by Fleming include a colleague at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Robert Harling, whose name was used for the Commissioner of Police, Harling; an ex-colleague from his stock-broking days, Hugo Pitman, who became Chief of Immigration Pitman and Fleming&#x27;s golfing friend, Bunny Roddick, who became Deputy Governor Roddick.

===Characters===

The central character in the novel is James Bond. According to Raymond Benson—the author of the continuation Bond novels—the Bond character is developed further from the previous novels, including a sharper sense of humour and an increased sense of mortality. The book begins with the details of his recent medical being examined. It is recorded that he smokes sixty high-nicotine cigarettes a day and an &quot;average daily consumption of alcohol is in the region of half a bottle of spirits of between sixty and seventy proof&quot;. One study, undertaken by doctors, estimates this intake to be equivalent to drinking 105 units of alcohol a week; as at 2025 the UK&#x27;s medical recommendations for an adult male are for a maximum of 21 units per week. The novel also gives a small insight into Bond&#x27;s views on social matters, which are described by the media historian James Chapman as being &quot;conservative in the extreme&quot;, when Bond takes an instant dislike of a young taxi-driver he describes as &quot;typical of the cheap self-assertiveness of young labour since the war&quot;.
Bond is joined in his mission by his friend the CIA agent Felix Leiter, who has his largest role to date in a Bond story. Leiter&#x27;s humour is the source of the verbal comedy in the book; the incapacity he suffered in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene towards the end of the novel.
Domino Vitali has many characteristics that Bond found admirable, including her sense of independence. Fleming describes her as &quot;an independent, a girl of authority and character. She might like the rich, gay life but, so far as Bond was concerned, that was the right kind of girl&quot;. He goes on to describe her approach to sex: &quot;She might sleep with men, obviously did, but it would be on her terms, not theirs&quot;, and Chapman observes that the freedom to make her own sexual choices were possibly the early signs of the sexual liberation that made part of the counterculture of the 1960s.

The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett see masculine aspects to Domino&#x27;s character which manifest as &quot;excessive aggressiveness and over-dominating bearing&quot; which, they say, could be connected to her full first name, Dominetta, which translates as &quot;little dominator&quot;. Fleming stresses such a masculine attitude in her approach to driving:

But this girl drove like a man. She was entirely focused on the road ahead and on what was going on in her driving mirror, an accessory rarely used by women except for making up their faces. And, equally rare in a woman, she took a man&#x27;s pleasure in the feel of her machine

Domino is one of several women to come to Bond&#x27;s aid at crucial moments in the books, and saves Bond&#x27;s life at the end by killing Largo.
Emilio Largo is the head of the SPECTRE team involved in stealing the nuclear bombs, and despite being the main adversary for Bond, he is not the primary antagonist, which is Blofeld. The Anglicist Robert Druce describes Largo as &quot;a barely sketched-in &#x27;playboy&#x27; character&quot;. As with most villains in the Bond novels, there is an unattractive physical attribute and although good looking, Largo&#x27;s hands &quot;were almost twice the normal size, even for a man of his stature, ... they looked ... almost like large brown furry animals quite separate from their owner&quot;. The cultural critic Umberto Eco describes Largo as handsome but &quot;vulgar and cruel&quot;; while noting that most of Fleming&#x27;s villains were monstrous, Eco considers that Largo&#x27;s &quot;monstrosity is purely mental&quot;. The cultural historian Sue Matheson observes that although Largo is a dangerous opponent, &quot;he drinks crème de menthe frappes topped with maraschino cherries – a sweet and effete drink&quot;.
Although Blofeld only appears in two chapters, Benson considers that it is he whom Bond battles, and not Largo. The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek describes Blofeld as &quot;not only enormously powerful and grotesque, but ... also part intellectual and part &#x27;gentleman crook&#x27;.&quot; Blofeld differs from other villains in the Bond series, according to the literary historian Lars Ole Sauerberg. The villains in Fleming&#x27;s previous novels are either criminals with large ambitions or those who commit crimes to complete their larger plans; Blofeld occupies his own classification as the only one of whom it is not possible to distinguish between a criminal act as a means or an end. Sauerberg considers that Blofeld&#x27;s motives are &quot;in his general nihilism and destructive urge&quot;. The sociologist Anthony Synnott notes that not only are nearly all Bond&#x27;s enemies foreign, they are &quot;&quot;doubly&quot; foreign&quot;. Blofeld&#x27;s ancestry shows he is Polish and Greek and, during the Second World War, he had betrayed Poland by working with the , the Nazi military-intelligence service.

With Blofeld appearing in two subsequent novels, this book forms the opening of what is known as the &quot;Blofeld trilogy&quot;. The second in the trilogy, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, ends with Blofeld involved in the murder of Bond&#x27;s wife and the final chapter, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, ends with Blofeld&#x27;s death at Bond&#x27;s hands.

==Style==
In 1962 Fleming wrote of his work, &quot;while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as &#x27;thrillers designed to be read as literature&#x27;.&quot; To achieve this he used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which the writer Kingsley Amis called &quot;the Fleming effect&quot;. Amis describes it as &quot;the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond&#x27;s world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced&quot;. According to Amis, Thunderball provides good examples of the use of the technique. This includes the full and detailed biographies in the novel for Blofeld, Largo and Petacchi; SPECTRE&#x27;s headquarters in the Boulevard Haussmann and the workings of , SPECTRE&#x27;s cover organisation; the American nuclear submarine, the USS &quot;Manta&quot;; and the pirates&#x27; treasure ships of the South Bahamas.

Within the text Benson identifies what he described as the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot;, the use of &quot;hooks&quot; at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. In &quot;Thunderball&quot; the sweep works to build the tension, as does the fact that Bond and Leiter are working to a time limit to find the bombs. With the removal of the Russian threat from the novel, Panek considers that &quot;Thunderball&quot; is &quot;the ultimate heist ... with a tiny bit of international garnish thrown in.&quot;

The Shrublands section of the story is a revenge fantasy, according to Druce. The remainder of the novel is, in Druce&#x27;s view, &quot;a pastiche of an adventure story&quot; of the likes of Sapper&#x27;s Bulldog Drummond or Leslie Charteris&#x27;s Saint stories.

==Themes==
At the time Fleming was writing &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the Cold War seemed to be easing, with relations between East and West seeming to move towards détente. Fleming decided to use a politically neutral enemy for Bond; he wrote &quot;I could not see any point in going on digging at [the Russians], especially when the co-existence thing seemed to be bearing some fruit. So I closed down SMERSH and thought up SPECTRE instead.&quot; The Anglicist Christoph Lindner identifies the use of the organisation as part of a second wave of Bond villains, the first wave having comprised SMERSH. The introduction of SPECTRE and its use over several books give a measure of continuity to the remaining stories in the series, according to the historian Jeremy Black. Black argues that SPECTRE represents &quot;evil unconstrained by ideology&quot; and it partly came about because the decline of the British Empire led to a lack of certainty in Fleming&#x27;s mind. This is reflected in Bond&#x27;s using US equipment and personnel in the novel, such as the Geiger counter and nuclear submarine. Although the thaw in relations was present during the writing of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the Cold War escalated again shortly afterwards, with the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis all occurring in an eighteen-month period from April 1961 to November 1962.

SPECTRE was originally short for &quot;Special Executive for Terrorism, Revolution and Espionage&quot;, but Fleming changed the last two elements to revenge and extortion, ensuring the organisation was free from ideological constraints and allowing him to change his focus away from any threat from the Soviets.

==Release and reception==
===Publication history===
&quot;Thunderball&quot; was published on 27 March 1961 in the UK as a hardcover edition by the publishers Jonathan Cape; it was 253 pages long and cost 15 shillings. 50,000 copies were printed and Cape sent out 32,000 copies of the novel to 864 UK booksellers and 603 outside the UK. Cape spent £2,000 on advance publicity. While the first edition stated &quot;By Ian Fleming&quot; on the title page, the second edition—published in 1964—included writing credits for McClory and Whittingham.

Fleming&#x27;s regular cover artist Richard Chopping once again provided the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to him to ask if he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, and instructed: &quot;The picture would consist of the skeleton of a man&#x27;s hand with the fingers resting on the queen of hearts. Through the back of the hand a dagger is plunged into the table top.&quot;
For the Jamaican market, a paper wraparound band was produced which read &quot;&quot;The&quot; thriller set in the Bahamas!&quot; &quot;Thunderball&quot; was published in the US by Viking Press and sold better than any of the previous Bond books. In May 1963 Pan Books published a paperback version of &quot;Thunderball&quot; in the UK that sold 808,000 copies before the end of the year, 617,000 in 1964 and 809,000 in 1965. In 1965 a special edition was produced to tie in with the release of the film &quot;Thunderball&quot; with a promotional tie-in with Player&#x27;s Navy Cut, based on a passage in the book where Domino discusses a story behind the sailor in the logo. The version included a letter to Bond written by Domino asking him to read the pages with the story about the sailor.

Since its initial publication the book has been reissued in hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and, as at 2025, has never been out of print. In 2023 Ian Fleming Publications—the company that administers all Fleming&#x27;s literary works—had the Bond series edited as part of a sensitivity review to remove or reword some racial or ethnic descriptors. The rerelease of the series was for the 70th anniversary of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the first Bond novel. For &quot;Thunderball&quot;, one of the barmen had his ethnicity edited out.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Thunderball&quot; was generally well received by the critics. Two of the reviews referred to the negative publicity that surrounded &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1958)—in particular the article &quot;Sex, Snobbery and Sadism&quot; by Paul Johnson in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Francis Iles, who thought the novel was &quot;a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines&quot;, was left &quot;wondering what all the fuss is about&quot;, noting that &quot;there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of the author of this kind of thriller&quot;. Peter Duval Smith, writing in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming&#x27;s work against negative criticism and said about Johnson&#x27;s review: &quot;one should not make a cult of Fleming&#x27;s novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing.&quot; Duval Smith thought that &quot;Thunderball&quot; was &quot;an exciting story ... skilfully told&quot;. Of Fleming&#x27;s books, he considered it &quot;the best written since &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think.&quot; The critic for &quot;The Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;Thunderball&quot; &quot;relies for its kicks far less than did &quot;Dr. No&quot; or &quot;Goldfinger&quot; on sadism and a slightly condescending sophistication.&quot; The upshot, in the critic&#x27;s opinion, was that &quot;the mixture—of good living, sex and violent action—is as before, but this is a highly polished performance, with an ingenious plot well documented and plenty of excitement.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Harold Kneeland considered that &quot;Thunderball&quot; was &quot;not top Fleming, but still well ahead of the pack&quot;, while Charles Poore, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered the Bond novels to be &quot;post-Dostoevskian ventures in crime and punishment&quot;. &quot;Thunderball&quot; he found to be &quot;a mystery story, a thriller, a chiller and a pleasure to read.&quot; Poore identified aspects of the author&#x27;s technique to be part of the success, saying &quot;the suspense and the surprises that animate the novel arise from the conceits with which Mr. Fleming decorates his tapestry of thieving and deceiving&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Philip John Stead thought that Fleming &quot;continues uninhibitedly to deploy his story-telling talents within the limits of the Commander Bond formula&quot;, while &quot;the usual beatings-up, modern style, are ingeniously administered to lady and gentleman alike&quot;. As to why the novels were so appealing, Stead considered that &quot;Fleming&#x27;s special magic lies in his power to impart sophistication to his mighty nonsense; his fantasies connect with up-to-date and lively knowledge of places and of the general sphere of crime and espionage.&quot; Overall, in Stead&#x27;s opinion, with &quot;Thunderball&quot; &quot;the mixture, exotic as ever, generates an extravagant and exhilarating tale and Bond connoisseurs will be glad to have it.&quot; Julian Symons at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; considered Fleming to have &quot;a sensational imagination, but informed by style, zest and—above all—knowledge&quot;. Duval Smith also expressed concern for the central character, saying &quot;I was glad to see him [Bond] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don&#x27;t call a lot, unless he wasn&#x27;t eating properly.&quot;

Anthony Boucher—described by Fleming&#x27;s biographer John Pearson as &quot;throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man&quot;—wrote: &quot;As usual, Ian Fleming has less story to tell in 90,000 words than Buchan managed in 40,000; but &quot;Thunderball&quot; is still an extravagant adventure&quot;.

==Adaptations==

A comic strip adaptation was published daily in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and syndicated worldwide, beginning on 11 November 1961. The owner of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Lord Beaverbrook, cancelled the strip on 10 February 1962 after Fleming signed an agreement with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; for them to publish the short story &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. The story was finished off in two days of strips. The &quot;Thunderball&quot; strip was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books as part of the &quot;Dr. No&quot; anthology that also includes &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;.

&quot;Thunderball&quot; was planned to be the first Fleming novel made by Eon Productions, although the controversy over the novel&#x27;s origins persuaded Eon to choose &quot;Dr. No&quot; instead. In 1965 Eon released &quot;Thunderball&quot;, starring Sean Connery; it was their fourth Bond film. As well as listing Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as producers, McClory was also included in the production team. Broccoli and Saltzman made a deal with McClory to undertake a joint production of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, which stopped McClory from making any further film version of the novel for ten years. Kevin McClory produced &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;—a version of the &quot;Thunderball&quot; story—in 1983, with Connery as Bond. In the 1990s McClory announced plans to make another adaptation of the &quot;Thunderball&quot; story, &quot;Warhead 2000 AD&quot;, with Timothy Dalton or Liam Neeson in the lead role, but this was eventually dropped.

In December 2016 &quot;Thunderball&quot; was dramatised as a 90-minute radio play on BBC Radio 4; Toby Stephens played Bond, Tom Conti played Largo and Alfred Molina played Blofeld.

<text>Morningside Heights is a neighborhood on the West Side of Upper Manhattan in New York City. It is bounded by Morningside Drive to the east, 125th Street to the north, 110th Street to the south, and Riverside Drive to the west. Morningside Heights borders Central Harlem and Morningside Park to the east, Manhattanville to the north, the Manhattan Valley section of the Upper West Side to the south, and Riverside Park to the west. Broadway is the neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfare, running north–south.

Morningside Heights, located on a high plateau between Morningside and Riverside Parks, was hard to access until the late 19th century and was sparsely developed except for the Bloomingdale and Leake and Watts asylums. Morningside Heights and the Upper West Side were considered part of the Bloomingdale District until Morningside Park was finished in the late 19th century. Large-scale development started in the 1890s with academic and cultural institutions. By the 1900s, public transportation construction and the neighborhood&#x27;s first subway line led to Morningside Heights being developed into a residential neighborhood. Morningside Heights was mostly developed by the 1930s. During the mid-20th century, as the institutions within Morningside Heights expanded, cultural tensions grew between residents who were affiliated with institutions and those who were not. After a period of decline, the neighborhood started to gentrify in the 1980s and 1990s.

A large portion of Morningside Heights is part of the campus of Columbia University, a private Ivy League university. Morningside Heights contains numerous other educational institutions such as Teachers College, Barnard College, the Manhattan School of Music, Bank Street College of Education, Union Theological Seminary, and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Additionally, Morningside Heights includes several religious institutions, including the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Riverside Church, the Church of Notre Dame, Corpus Christi Church, and Interchurch Center. The neighborhood also contains other architectural landmarks, such as St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital (now Mount Sinai Morningside) and Grant&#x27;s Tomb.

Morningside Heights is part of Manhattan Community District 9. It is patrolled by the 26th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Fire services are provided by the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s Engine Company 47 and Engine Company 37/Ladder Company 40. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 7th District.

== History ==

=== Precolonial and colonial period ===
Initially, Manhattan was settled by the Lenape Native Americans, who referred to the area nearby as &quot;Muscota&quot; or &quot;Muscoota&quot;, meaning &quot;place of rushes&quot;. The nearest Native American settlements were Rechewanis and Konaande Kongh in present-day Central Park, to the southeast of modern Morningside Heights. Additionally, a Native American path in the area was adapted into part of modern-day Riverside Drive. However, the region remained relatively hard to access because of the steep topography. Prior to the beginning of the 18th century, most travel within modern New York City was made via water, since there were few roads in the region.

Dutch settlers occupied Manhattan in the early 17th century and called the nearby area &quot;Vredendal&quot;, meaning &quot;peaceful dale&quot;. The western boundary of New Harlem was drawn through the present-day Morningside Park in 1666, running from 74th Street at the East River to 124th Street at the North River (now Hudson River) on the neighborhood&#x27;s western edge. The area to the west of the boundary, present-day Morningside Heights, was originally the common lands of British-occupied New York. In 1686, New York colonial governor Thomas Dongan granted the city of New York the patent to a triangular area between West 107th to 124th Streets, extending west to the Hudson River. The city sold the land to Jacob De Key in 1701. An easy connection to the rest of the modern-day city was made two years later, when Bloomingdale Road (modern-day Broadway) was extended north from Lower Manhattan to 117th Street. Harman Vandewater acquired part of the De Key farm by 1735, and it was called Vandewater Heights by 1738.

On September 16, 1776, the Battle of Harlem Heights was fought in the area, with the most intense fighting occurring in a sloping wheat field that is now the location of Barnard College. A plaque by the Columbia University gate on 117th Street and Broadway commemorates this battle. Vandewater Heights was sold by 1785 to James W. De Peyster. His brother, Nicholas De Peyster, bought the land directly to the west, along the shoreline.

=== 19th-century development ===
Though a grid for Manhattan Island would be laid out in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, the present-day Morningside Heights would remain sparsely developed for the next half-century, with the exception of the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum and the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum. The Society for New York Hospital had started buying lots between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenues north of 113th Street in 1816, and opened the Bloomingdale Asylum in 1821. Leake and Watts Services purchased the Society&#x27;s land east of Amsterdam Avenue between 110th and 113th Streets in 1834, and Ithiel Town&#x27;s design for the Leake and Watts Asylum was completed in 1843. In addition, the Croton Aqueduct ran above ground through the modern neighborhood, opening in 1842.

Through the late 19th century, Bloomingdale Road was the only connection to the rest of Manhattan. A stagecoach line along Bloomingdale Road, founded in 1819, was expanded to modern Morningside Heights and Manhattanville four years later. Mansions were developed on the shore, and William Dixon erected small wood-frame houses on 110th Street, which would be referred to as &quot;Dixonville&quot;. In 1846, the Hudson River Railroad (later the West Side Line and Hudson Line) was built along the Hudson River waterfront, connecting New York City to Albany.

By an act of the New York State Legislature passed in 1865, the commissioners of Central Park had the responsibility of executing the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 within Upper Manhattan. The same year, Central Park commissioner William R. Martin put forth the first proposal for a park and scenic road along the Hudson River, which later became Riverside Park and Riverside Drive. On the opposite side of the modern-day neighborhood, to the east, Central Park commissioner Andrew Haswell Green proposed Morningside Park in 1867 to avoid the expense of expanding the Manhattan street grid across extremely steep terrain. Landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted was hired for both projects: he designed Riverside Drive and Park in 1873–1875, and he co-designed Morningside Park with Calvert Vaux in 1873, with further revisions to the latter in 1887. The section of Riverside Drive and Park in the Bloomingdale District, of which modern-day Morningside Heights was considered to be part, was completed by 1880. Morningside Park was completed in 1895.

Though several other infrastructure improvements were made, development in the region above 110th Street was slow until the 1890s. Broadway, a wide avenue with medians, opened in 1868 as the &quot;Boulevard&quot; and replaced the former Bloomingdale Road. New pipes for the Croton Aqueduct were laid in 1865, and a still-extant gatehouse at 113th Street was erected later. Plans to relocate the Bloomingdale Asylum were considered as early as 1870, but the Panic of 1873 stalled any additional planning for the rest of the decade. The Ninth Avenue elevated was extended north from the Bloomingdale District to Harlem in 1879, but its route largely skipped the highlands north of 110th Street, as its route shifted eastward at 110th Street. An elevated station at 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue was not opened until 1903, and even then, it was hard to access due to the steep topography. Thus, while the Upper West Side to the south and Hamilton Heights to the north were developed with row houses by the 1880s, the intervening area had almost no new development. &quot;The Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; stated that it was &quot;difficult to explore the region without a guide&quot; because of the lack of development there.

=== 1890s through 1930s ===
In 1886, real estate figures and politicians started advocating for the relocation of both asylums in the neighborhood. The asylums were seen as holding up development in the area. The Bloomingdale Asylum had twice rejected offers to purchase its land: first in 1880, when Ulysses S. Grant advocated for a world&#x27;s fair to be held there three years later, and then in 1888, when the area was being considered as the site of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to be held during 1892.

The Bloomingdale Asylum moved to a site in suburban Westchester County in 1888, followed by the Leake and Watts Asylum three years later. Their respective campuses were purchased by Columbia University, which could not expand their existing campus at the present site of Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan; and the Episcopal Diocese of New York, which had been looking for sites to build their main cathedral, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Several other educational institutions were soon constructed in the area, including Barnard College, Teachers College, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and Union Theological Seminary. Medical institutions moved there as well, such as St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital and the Woman&#x27;s Hospital.

==== New name and first residential buildings ====

In the 1890s, following Morningside Park&#x27;s completion, several figures began advocating for the use of the name &quot;Morningside Heights&quot; for the region between 110th and 125th Streets. The name &quot;Bloomingdale&quot; was also used for the area around the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. However, other names such as &quot;Morningside Hill&quot; and &quot;Riverside Heights&quot; were used for the area. When construction started on Columbia University, Teachers College, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in the mid-1890s, no single name was commonly used for the neighborhood. Two names eventually gained the most use; &quot;Morningside Heights&quot; was preferred by the two colleges, while &quot;Cathedral Heights&quot; was preferred by St. John&#x27;s and St. Luke&#x27;s. After about 1898, &quot;Morningside Heights&quot; became the most generally accepted, although the diocese at St. John&#x27;s continued to call the neighborhood &quot;Cathedral Heights&quot; well into the 20th century.

Additionally, Manhattan&#x27;s population was growing rapidly, exceeding one million in 1890. Speculative developers, hoping to cater to Morningside Heights&#x27; institutions and Manhattan&#x27;s increasing population, started erecting the first row houses in the area in 1892–1893. These early buildings were designed in the Colonial, Georgian, or Renaissance Revival styles, in contrast to the architecture of the older row houses in nearby neighborhoods. These developers saw mixed success: while some houses sold quickly, others languished for a decade or were foreclosed. The Morningside Protective Association, established in 1896, unsuccessfully attempted to limit the proliferation of low-rise development. The first tenements in Morningside Heights were built toward the end of the 1890s and were among the only Old Law Tenements built in the neighborhood.

==== Academic Acropolis development ====
The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, on Amsterdam Avenue between 110th and 113th Streets, had been the first institution to commit to building in Morningside Heights. However, construction proceeded very slowly: the first portion of the cathedral did not open until 1911, and the cathedral remained incomplete a century later. Nonetheless, its presence led other institutions to move to the neighborhood. The first of these was St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, which in 1892 purchased the site directly north of the cathedral as a direct result of influence from cathedral secretary George Macculloch Miller. Built to designs by Ernest Flagg, the first five pavilions in the hospital opened in 1896, with three additional pavilions being added later. Next was Cady, Berg &amp; See&#x27;s Home for Old Men and Aged Couples, built at Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street and opened in 1896. Third to come was the Woman&#x27;s Hospital at Amsterdam Avenue and 110th Street, which was designed by Frederick R. Allen of Allen &amp; Collens and completed in 1906. While these projects led to Morningside Heights being known as an &quot;Academic Acropolis&quot;, they did not significantly alter the character of the neighborhood.
By the late 1890s and early 1900s, Morningside Heights&#x27; academic institutions were growing rapidly. The most prominent of these was Columbia University, whose president Seth Low had commissioned Charles Follen McKim of the architectural firm McKim, Mead &amp; White to design the new Morningside Heights campus in 1893. The plan consisted of 15 buildings and a South Court on the east side of Broadway between 116th and 120th Streets, centered around the university&#x27;s major library, Low Memorial Library. The Low Library was constructed between 1895 and 1897, along with most of the other original structures, and the first classes at the new campus were held in October 1897. Several campus expansions occurred shortly afterward, including Earl Hall in 1902; the first dormitories, Hartley Hall and Livingston Hall, in 1905; South Field, purchased in 1903; St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, completed in 1907; and numerous classrooms and other buildings. Columbia&#x27;s presence in Morningside Heights led to a significant change in the neighborhood&#x27;s character, and was dubbed by the &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; as &quot;the largest single factor [...] in promoting private real estate and building activity on the plateau&quot;.

Just across Broadway to the west was the campus of Barnard College, a women&#x27;s college. In 1895, philanthropist Elizabeth Milbank Anderson donated funds on the condition that Charles A. Rich was hired to design the campus. Before funds ran out, Rich ultimately designed the Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Fiske Halls, which held their first classes in October 1897. Immediately north was Teachers College, which became affiliated with Columbia University in 1893 and merged with the latter in 1897. The buildings for this campus were designed by William Appleton Potter. The first structure in the complex, Main Hall, was completed in late 1894; the last, Milbank Memorial Hall, was finished three years later. Both Barnard and Teachers Colleges saw rapid growth in the early 20th century. Only three structures were built for Barnard, resulting in overcrowding; by contrast, numerous large facilities were erected for Teachers College, including a gymnasium, manual arts building, household arts building, and dormitories.

Other institutions of higher education on Morningside Heights were developed in the early 20th century, the first of which was the new campus of the Union Theological Seminary between Broadway and Claremont Avenue from 120th to 122nd Streets. The campus was composed of several Gothic Revival structures, designed by architects Allen &amp; Collens and arranged around a quadrangle. The structures were completed by 1910, and expanded soon after with the construction of the Stone Gym in 1912 (now part of Riverside Church), and a dormitory on Claremont Avenue erected in 1931–1932. Two musical institutions, the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard School (which later merged), settled immediately north of the Union Theological Seminary. The Institute of Musical Art constructed its building within 21 weeks in 1910 and had its first classes that same year. The Juilliard building was completed in 1931. The final structure to be built was the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, across Broadway to the east of Juilliard, whose buildings were completed in 1930. Riverside Church, to the west of the Union Theological Seminary, was completed the same year.

==== Apartment developments and subway construction ====

There was still little residential development in the first decade of the 20th century. A small concentration of beer gardens began to develop around the &quot;Dixonville&quot; on 110th Street. The New York State Tenement House Act of 1901 drastically changed the regulations to which tenement buildings had to conform. To fit these new regulations, the architects of the different developments drew up several general plans to maximize the amount of floor space in each building, while also ensuring every residential unit had windows that faced either a courtyard or the street. The more common plans included L-, I-, O-, or U-shaped designs. Several buildings were erected close to Broadway in anticipation of the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s first subway line (now part of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, serving the ). These buildings contained features that were considered innovative at the time, such as electric lighting, soundproofed and parquet floors, tiled bathrooms with porcelain fixtures, and long-distance telephone lines. Since the character of the neighborhood had not yet been developed, early-1900s apartment buildings tended to be erected &quot;modestly&quot;, with little ornamentation.

The subway opened in October 1904 with stations at 110th, 116th, and 125th Streets, providing a direct connection to Lower Manhattan, the city&#x27;s economic center at the time. In subsequent years, developers erected larger buildings for the middle class, which had been made feasible by the area&#x27;s proximity to the subway. Between 1903 and 1911, at least 75 apartment buildings were built in the neighborhood. By 1906, there were 27 such developments underway, including structures on which work had started before the 1901 law had been passed. A &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; article published in August 1906 described Morningside Heights as New York City&#x27;s &quot;most distinctive high-class apartment house quarter&quot;. Units on Riverside Drive, despite being further from the subway, were generally more expensive because of their riverfront views.

Jewish and Italian developers had a large influence in early-20th century development in Morningside Heights. For instance, the Italian-American Paterno brothers, along with their brothers-in-law, built The Paterno, The Colosseum, and several other large apartment buildings in the area. Two members of the family, Michael Paterno and Victor Cerabone, also started their own firms and built structures in Morningside Heights. The majority of Morningside Heights developers were Jewish, although most of these Jewish developers created only a few buildings. More prolific Jewish developers in Morningside Heights created companies that either carried their family names or had more generic names that hid their family&#x27;s background. Such developers included Carlyle Realty, B. Crystal &amp; Son, and Carnegie Construction. According to Andrew Dolkart, architectural historian at Columbia University, more than half of the early apartment housing in Morningside Heights was developed by one of three firms: George Pelham, Neville &amp; Bagge, or Schwartz &amp; Gross. After World War I, the remaining empty lots were bought and developed.

By the 1920s, the neighborhood&#x27;s character had been fully established. In addition to apartment buildings, Morningside Heights contained commercial ventures, though these were mainly confined to low-rise buildings on the north–south avenues. Through the 1930s, many residents were white and middle-class. The heads of these families included professionals like academics, engineers, doctors, lawyers, and businesspersons who worked in industries such as the garment trade.

=== Mid- and late 20th century ===

==== Demographic changes ====
As early as 1930, the neighborhood was undergoing major demographic changes, and the newcomers included middle-class families who were not necessarily part of any institution. This resulted in a split between the two main groups that inhabited Morningside Heights—those who were affiliated with institutions and those who were not—setting up conflicts between the two demographic groups.

As a response to the Great Depression, many of the apartments had been subdivided into smaller units, with residents frequently dividing their apartments or taking in boarders, or owners converting their buildings to single room occupancy (SRO) hotels. The increasing prevalence of SROs led to attendant socioeconomic problems and a decline in the neighborhood, especially after World War II, when many well-off white residents left for the suburbs, to be replaced by poor African American and Puerto Rican residents. Many of the once-opulent apartment buildings declined in quality. In a sign of the social tensions that had developed in Morningside Heights, in 1958, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that midshipmen of the United States Navy studying at Columbia were forbidden from the area bounded by Broadway, Amsterdam Avenue, and 110th and 113th Streets, where there were reported to be high concentrations of prostitutes. Two years later, the &quot;Times&quot; called the formerly opulent Hendrik Hudson apartment building &quot;one of the city&#x27;s worst slum buildings&quot;, with several hundred building and health code violations. By 1961, there were 33 SROs in the neighborhood.

==== Urban renewal ====

In 1947, fourteen major institutions in the neighborhood formed Morningside Heights Inc, an urban renewal organization that aimed to reduce poverty and segregation by erecting new housing. Morningside Heights Inc., headed by David Rockefeller, was the first major joint venture between the neighborhood&#x27;s institutions. Its first project was Morningside Gardens, a middle-income co-op apartment complex between 123rd and LaSalle Streets, Broadway, and Amsterdam Avenue. The project, completed in 1957, was initially occupied by a multi-racial tenant base of just under a thousand families, a third of whom worked at neighborhood institutions. Morningside Gardens drew some opposition, as it replaced an eclectic group of low- and mid-rise housing that was occupied by about 6,000 people, mostly African Americans.

Another development in the neighborhood was Grant Houses, a New York City Housing Authority public-housing development located to the east of Morningside Gardens, across Amsterdam Avenue. Completed in 1956, it was less successful in racial integration but was praised by local landlords as a deterrent to urban decay. The construction of Grant Houses necessitated the displacement of 7,000 residents.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the urban renewal scheme in 1957 as &quot;the biggest face-lifting job under way in this city&quot;. Prior to the urban renewal projects, most institutions in Morningside Heights considered its northern boundary to be around 122nd Street, but with the completion of these developments, the area between 122nd and 125th Street was added to the popular definition of Morningside Heights.

==== Institutional expansion ====
Three institutions opened or moved into Morningside Heights during the late 1950s and early 1960s. These were the Interchurch Center, opened in 1960; the Bank Street College of Education, which announced its intention to move to the area in 1964; and St. Hilda&#x27;s &amp; St. Hugh&#x27;s School, which relocated from Manhattan Valley and Morningside Heights in 1967. Columbia assisted with the latter two additions, since it was interested in making Morningside Heights into a desirable place for its faculty to send their children to primary school. Within the existing campuses of neighborhood institutions, two St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital pavilions were demolished and replaced in the 1950s and 1960s, and a new office wing at Riverside Church opened in 1959.

Social tensions began to develop as many of the area&#x27;s institutions began to expand into the surrounding neighborhood. The newer buildings had architecture that was described as bland, as contrasted to the simultaneous expansions of other communities with Ivy League universities, which were constructing structures with more distinctive designs. Through the 1960s, Columbia University, Barnard College, and other institutions purchased several dozen buildings in Morningside Heights, leading to accusations of forced eviction and gentrification. Many residential buildings were converted to institutional use, while others were demolished to make way for new institutional buildings, such as Columbia University&#x27;s East Campus. The process involved demolishing some of the SROs, which were mostly occupied by racial minorities and did not have rent regulation. Likewise, while apartment buildings were rent-regulated, many units were subject to &quot;affiliation clauses&quot; that extended tenancy only to members of the academic institutions within Morningside Heights. Protests against such clauses continued through the late 1970s.

The conflicts peaked in 1968, when protests arose in Columbia&#x27;s campus and the surrounding neighborhood over the university&#x27;s proposal to build a gym in Morningside Park, which would have created separate entrances in mostly-white Morningside Heights and mostly-black Harlem. The university abandoned the plan the next year. Two other major plans were proposed but not built after objections from the community: a proposed expansion of the Interchurch Center, and a nursing home on Amsterdam Avenue between 111th and 112th Streets. There were even disputes between the city and Columbia University: the city had proposed erecting 1,000 apartments on Riverside Drive, but Columbia objected because it would have precluded the university&#x27;s ability to build a proposed western campus. In 1970, I. M. Pei was hired to create a new plan for Columbia&#x27;s expansion on the South Field, though only one portion of Pei&#x27;s plan was ever built.

==== 1970s to 1990s ====
In the 1970s, as crimes increased in the city in general, institutional leaders in Morningside Heights raised concerns about safety and security. Meanwhile, Columbia University continued to expand its presence in the neighborhood. By the late 1970s, one in five apartment buildings in Morningside Heights were owned by Columbia, and by the 1980s, it was the neighborhood&#x27;s largest landlord. In 1979, a Barnard College student was killed by masonry that had fallen from a building owned by Columbia. In the subsequent years, new building codes resulted in the removal of decorative elements on many buildings in the neighborhood.

The residential community of Morningside Heights remained centered around the neighboring institutions, and was relatively safe compared to nearby neighborhoods, though many residents stayed away from Morningside Park. A 1982 &quot;Times&quot; article mentioned that Broadway was seeing many new &quot;restaurants and boutiques&quot; that had replaced &quot;dusty shops and fast-food counters&quot;. By 1987, Morningside Heights was much safer compared to fifteen years prior, with Broadway being redeveloped as a fashionable shopping district. Much of this effort was undertaken by Columbia, which sought to improve its reputation among the surrounding community.

Columbia started to restore several of its buildings in the 1990s, and it continued to expand into Morningside Heights. By the end of the decade, there were only 50 apartment buildings between 110th and 122nd Streets that were not owned by the university. Other structures were also built in Morningside Heights, including Barnard&#x27;s Sulzberger Hall. Morningside Park, which received a series of renovations in the 1980s and 1990s, was no longer considered to be as dangerous by the beginning of the 21st century. Despite its redevelopment, the neighborhood still retained some of its working-class character, mostly because of Columbia&#x27;s affiliation-clause policy, leading the &quot;Times&quot; to say in 1993 that Morningside Heights &quot;has practically escaped yuppification&quot;. Housing prices started to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. A 1999 &quot;Times&quot; article mentioned that though there were still tensions between residents and institutions, these conflicts had subsided somewhat, with institutions being more receptive to feedback from residents.

=== 21st century ===
In the late 1990s, some businesses in the area started labeling Morningside Heights and southern Harlem with the name SoHa (for &quot;South Harlem&quot; or &quot;South of Harlem&quot;), as seen in the names of Max&#x27;s SoHa restaurant and the former SoHa nightclub in Morningside Heights. &quot;SoHa&quot; has become a controversial name, having been used by the real estate industry and other individuals gentrifying the area between West 110th and 125th Streets. One critic called the SoHa name &quot;insulting and another sign of gentrification run amok&quot;, while another said that &quot;the rebranding not only places their neighborhood&#x27;s rich history under erasure but also appears to be intent on attracting new tenants, including students from nearby Columbia University.&quot; The controversy later led to proposals for legislation that would limit neighborhood rebranding citywide.

By the 2010s, new developments were being built amid several of Morningside Heights&#x27; preexisting institutions. For instance, two residential buildings had been erected on the cathedral close of St. John the Divine; part of the old St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital was being converted into apartments; and the Union and Jewish Theological Seminaries had sold the rights to build apartments on their campuses. However, the neighborhood still retained a reputation for being relatively affordable, with per-foot housing prices being lower than in nearby neighborhoods. In 2017, part of Morningside Heights was protected as part of the Morningside Heights Historic District. Despite advocacy from local residents, the New York City Department of City Planning declined to rezone Morningside Heights in 2019. This prompted residents to create a task force, the Morningside Heights Community Coalition, to rezone certain blocks to require affordable housing in certain types of developments. In 2021, the task force and local politicians announced a proposal to rezone a 15-block portion of Morningside Heights; if implemented, it would be the neighborhood&#x27;s first rezoning in six decades.

== Demographics ==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Morningside Heights was 55,929, an increase of 1,721 (3.2%) from the 54,208 counted in the 2000 Census. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 46.0% (25,750) White, 13.6% (7,619) African American, 0.2% (105) Native American, 13.3% (7,462) Asian, 0.1% (30) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (203) from other races, and 2.9% (1,605) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 23.5% (13,155) of the population.

The population of Morningside Heights changed moderately from 2000 to 2010, with an increase in the Asian population by 27% (1,565), a decrease in the Black population by 16% (1,502), and an increase in the White population by 7% (1,606). The Latino population experienced a slight decrease of 2% (203), while the population of all other races increased by 15% (255) yet remained a small minority.

The entirety of Manhattan Community District 9, which encompasses Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, and Hamilton Heights, had 111,287 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most residents are children and middle-aged adults: 34% are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 21% are between 45 and 64, and 17% are between 0 and 17. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 16% and 12% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 9 was $50,048, though the median income in Morningside Heights individually was $81,890. In 2018, an estimated 24% of Community District 9 residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twelve residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in Community District 9, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 9 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.

== Land use and terrain ==
Morningside Heights is located in Upper Manhattan, bounded by Morningside Park to the east, 125th Street to the north, 110th Street to the south, and Riverside Park to the west. The neighborhood is zoned primarily for high-rise apartment buildings, though ground-floor stores are also present on Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. In practice, much of the neighborhood is composed of structures for the neighborhood&#x27;s religious or academic institutions.

=== Residential stock ===
The residential stock of Morningside Heights is composed of apartment buildings, many of which survive from the neighborhood&#x27;s early-20th century wave of development. While many of the original apartments have been subdivided, numerous original five- to seven-bedroom units remain. Two of the more distinctive apartment structures are The Colosseum and The Paterno, at 116th Street and Riverside Drive, whose curved facades are the only evidence of a never-built large plaza that would have flanked Riverside Drive. Another notable apartment building is the Hendrik Hudson on Riverside Drive between 110th and 111th Streets, proposed as a hotel but ultimately constructed as a residential building.

The northern part of the neighborhood is dominated by two residential complexes: Grant Houses and Morningside Gardens. Grant Houses, a public-housing development composed of ten buildings, is located on the south side of 125th Street, on two superblocks between Broadway and Morningside Avenue, with the site being bisected by Amsterdam Avenue. The six-building Morningside Gardens co-op is located directly southwest of the Grant Houses superblocks and is bounded by 123rd and LaSalle Streets, Broadway, and Amsterdam Avenue.

=== Architectural landmarks ===

==== Official landmarks ====

Several sites in Morningside Heights have been designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as official city landmarks and/or are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Cathedral of St. John the Divine and its six-building cathedral close, on Amsterdam Avenue between 110th and 113th Streets, was designated by the city as an official landmark in 2017. Riverside Church, on Riverside Drive between 120th and 122nd Streets, is both a city landmark and NRHP site, as is the Church of Notre Dame at Morningside Drive and 114th Street.

Non-religious official landmarks in Morningside Heights include Grant&#x27;s Tomb, a mausoleum for U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant and his wife Julia Grant. The tomb, located in the middle of Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, is a city landmark, a NRHP site, and a national memorial. The Plant and Scrymser pavilions at Mount Sinai Morningside, located on Morningside Drive between 113th and 114th Streets, were built in 1904–1906 and 1926–1928 respectively; both pavilions are recognized as city landmarks and are on the NRHP.

Numerous academic buildings in Morningside Heights contain a city or national landmark designation. On the Columbia campus, these sites include Low Memorial Library, a National Historic Landmark as well as a city-designated interior and exterior landmark. Other NRHP sites on the Columbia campus include Philosophy Hall, where FM radio was invented; Pupin Hall, a National Historic Landmark where the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi; and Casa Italiana on the East Campus, which is also a city landmark. St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel is designated as a city landmark but not as a national landmark. On the Barnard campus, NRHP-listed sites include Students&#x27; Hall; Brooks and Hewitt Halls; and Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Fiske Halls. The Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building on Riverside Drive is also listed on the NRHP. Additionally, the Union Theological Seminary complex is listed on the NRHP, and parts of the structure are also a city-designated landmark.

There are several traces of the old Croton Aqueduct&#x27;s path through Morningside Heights, specifically under Amsterdam Avenue. Due to the presence of the 125th Street valley at the northern border of the neighborhood, the aqueduct descended into a deep level alignment, with the water being pushed through high-pressure open siphons at each end of the valley. Several gatehouses were built at Amsterdam Avenue and 113th, 119th, 134th–135th, and 142nd Streets, so that pipes could be installed when the aqueduct system was expanded in the future. The gatehouse at 113th Street was built in 1870 and rebuilt in 1890; it serves as an adult daycare center . The gatehouse at 119th Street, a city landmark, was rebuilt in 1894–1895, replacing an earlier gatehouse in the middle of the road. The aqueduct continued to carry water until 1955. The 119th Street gatehouse was used until 1990; it then sat abandoned for several decades before being proposed for commercial use in 2018.

==== Historic district ====

In 2017, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission created the Morningside Heights Historic District. The district had first been proposed in 1996; however, Columbia was opposed to such a designation, which would have limited the university&#x27;s flexibility as a landlord in Morningside Heights. The district includes 115 residential and institutional properties on West 109th Street west of Broadway; the blocks east and west of Broadway from Cathedral Parkway to West 113th Street; the blocks west of Broadway from West 113th to 118th Street; and the blocks west of Claremont Avenue from West 118th to 119th Street.

==== Other culturally significant locations ====

Tom&#x27;s Restaurant, on Broadway at 112th Street, was featured in the 1980s song &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; by Suzanne Vega, an alumna of Barnard College. Later, exterior shots were used on the television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as a stand-in for the diner hangout of the show&#x27;s principal characters.

The West End Bar served especially as a meeting place for writers of the Beat Generation in the 1940s and 1950s, as well as for student activists in the years surrounding the Columbia University protests of 1968. In 2006, the establishment was absorbed into a Cuban restaurant chain, Havana Central. Later, the space was a bar and restaurant known as Bernheim &amp; Schwartz before closing again.

The Hungarian Pastry Shop has long served as a regular place of visitation for students and professors at Columbia University, writers, and other residents of Morningside Heights and the Upper West Side.

=== Natural features ===
Morningside Heights is on a high plateau, bounded on two sides by parks and on a third by a steep valley. Morningside Park is located east of Morningside Drive, on the eastern boundary of the neighborhood. The park was built because the area&#x27;s steep topography created a cliff between the high ground of Morningside Heights to the west and the lower-lying land of Harlem to the east, making it impractical to build cross-streets through that area. This cliff was created through fault movement and smoothened during glacial periods. To the west is Riverside Park, the site of which was formerly rock outcroppings on the Hudson River. To the north is the 125th Street valley; the high plateau starts to descend into this valley at 122nd Street. It contains the Manhattanville Fault, which has seen earthquake activity as recently as 2001. The southern edge of the plateau, at 110th Street, is level with the neighboring Manhattan Valley neighborhood.

On West 114th Street, just west of Broadway, is a outcropping of Manhattan schist called Rat Rock. The outcropping is located between two row houses at 600 and 604 West 114th Street.

== Police and crime ==
Morningside Heights is patrolled by the 26th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 520 West 126th Street. The 26th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 76.3% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported 1 murder, 16 rapes, 104 robberies, 142 felony assaults, 118 burglaries, 341 grand larcenies, and 79 grand larcenies auto in 2022. Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 26th Precinct had a rate of 612 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the boroughwide average of 632 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000.

, Community District 9 has a non-fatal assault hospitalization rate of 57 per 100,000 people, compared to the boroughwide rate of 49 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 59 per 100,000. Its incarceration rate is 633 per 100,000 people, compared to the boroughwide rate of 407 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 425 per 100,000.

Cathedral Parkway draws responders from the 26th and 24th NYPD precincts, where jurisdiction is settled once the incident is under control. Columbia University Public Safety also patrols the area around the college. Realtime access and review of to CCTV imaging within Public Safety command centers of incidents within the blanket of coverage ranging from all corners of the neighborhood is available to reporting affiliates, NYPD detectives, and the general public for incidents invoking the Clery Act.

== Fire safety ==

Morningside Heights is served by two New York City Fire Department (FDNY) stations. The main fire station for the neighborhood is Engine Company 47, located at 502 West 113th Street, next to the old Croton gatehouse. The three-story building, designed in the Romanesque Revival style, is wide, with a facade of brick and brownstone, as well as Neoclassical-style brownstone and terracotta detailing. The building was erected in 1891 by Napoleon LeBrun &amp; Sons, a prolific builder of New York City firehouses in the late 19th century, and was one of the first major structures in Morningside Heights. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1997.

The other fire station serving Morningside Heights is Engine Company 37/Ladder Company 40, located at 415 West 125th Street, just across the neighborhood&#x27;s border with Manhattanville.

<text>William Allan Wulf (December 8, 1939 – March 10, 2023) was an American computer scientist notable for his work in programming languages and compilers.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Chicago, Wulf attended the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, receiving a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in engineering physics in 1961 and a Master of Science (M.S.) in electrical engineering in 1963. He then achieved the first Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in computer science from the University of Virginia in 1968.

== Career ==
In 1970, while at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), he designed the BLISS programming language and developed an optimizing compiler for it.

From 1971 to 1975, as part of CMUs C.mmp project, he worked on an operating system (OS) microkernel named Hydra which is capability-based, object-oriented, and designed to support a wide range of possible OSs to run on it.

With his wife Anita K. Jones, Wulf was a founder and vice president of Tartan Laboratories, a compiler technology company, in 1981.

Wulf served as president of the National Academy of Engineering from 1996 to 2007. He chaired the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Research Council from 1992 to 1996. Prior to that, he served as Assistant Director of the US National Science Foundation&#x27;s Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorate from 1988-1990. During this time, he played a major role in making the NSFnet computer network (as it was known at that time) available to the public as the Internet, for which he received the ACM Policy Award in 2017. He served on the Council of the ACM, on the board of directors of CRDF Global, and was a reviewing editor of &quot;Science&quot;. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. In 2007 Wulf was awarded the honor of delivering the prestigious Charles P. Steinmetz Lecture at Union College. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society that same year.

Wulf&#x27;s research also included computer architecture, computer security, and hardware-software codesign.

Wulf ended his career at the University of Virginia by resigning on Tuesday, June 19, 2012, in protest of the forced resignation of former President Teresa A. Sullivan, in what he called, &quot;the worst example of corporate governance I have ever seen. After widespread challenges from the faculty, student body, alumni, and the national academic community; and in the face of a direct threat from the Governor of Virginia that he would replace the entire board if they did not resolve the conflict, Sullivan was unanimously rehired some two weeks later.

== Personal life and death ==
Wulf was married to Anita K. Jones, an Emeritus Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia.

William Wulf died in Charlottesville, Virginia, on March 10, 2023, at the age of 83.

<doc id="276162" wikidata="Q700644" url="?curid=276162" title="Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein">
<text>Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (; ; 6 July 1829 – 14 January 1880) was the German pretender to the throne of second duke of Schleswig-Holstein from 1863, although in reality Prussia took overlordship and real administrative power.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Countess Louise Sophie of Danneskiold-Samsøe. He was ethnically perhaps the most Danish Prince of the Danish Royal dynasty in his generation (at the time of Denmark&#x27;s most recent succession crisis). 

His family belonged to the House of Oldenburg, the royal house that included all the medieval Scandinavian royal dynasties among its distant forebears - which it shared with his rivals and relatives, other claimants to the Danish throne. Both lines claim descent from the medieval Danish House of Estridsen via Christian I of Denmark&#x27;s ancestress Richeza of Denmark, Lady of Werle, the daughter of Eric V of Denmark, but Frederick also descended from Eric V&#x27;s son Christopher II of Denmark whom no heir or monarch of Denmark had been descended from since Christopher III of Denmark. Frederik&#x27;s paternal grandfather happened to have both grandfathers who were &quot;Royal&quot; dukes from the Oldenburg dynasty. 

Frederick also differed from his rivals in his specific ancestry among the contemporary Danish high nobility. His mother was from an ancient Danish family (Danneskiold-Samsøe), and his paternal grandmother Louise Auguste of Denmark was its royal princess. His paternal grandfather Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg numbered two ladies of Danish high nobility as his grandmothers (Danneskiold-Samsøe and Reventlow), and one Danish Countess as paternal great-grandmother (Ahlefeldt-Langeland). Frederick&#x27;s family had high hopes that in the then-rising era of nationalism, this ancestry would be viewed with favour when the legal question over whose claim was strongest would be decided. The family groomed Frederick to become a King of Denmark.

Unfortunately, Frederick, despite his more ethnically Danish ancestry was to become a symbol of German nationalism. Insider circles of Danish Royal government, for various reasons, were not favourable to the Augustenburgs. Instead, the Princess of Hesse and Prince of Glucksburg, closer relatives of the then royal family&#x27;s core, were preferred. Prince Frederick&#x27;s father became a protagonist in the 1848-1851 First Schleswig War, to the hostility of Danish nationalists.

Prince Frederick&#x27;s inherited claims were strongest to the almost wholly German-speaking Duchy of Holstein, while his rights as the heir-male of the House of Oldenburg proved too difficult to pursue, and Holstein, an originally Holy Roman Empire fief, had the Salic Law as a leading principle in its fundamental succession law. Schleswig and Denmark, much more Scandinavian in legal history, had legal precedents for elective and female succession. Frederick and his father, however Danish they actually were, realised this and leant towards German interests.

Young Frederick&#x27;s father found himself in an untenable position after the collapse of Prussian support and defeat of his own government at the end of the First Schleswig War in 1851. He renounced his claims as first in line to inherit the twin duchies in favour of the king of Denmark and his successors on 31 March 1852 in return for a financial compensation. The ducal family was banished.
Frederick now became the symbol of the nationalist German independence movement in Schleswig-Holstein. The renunciation was a hurdle which was explained away by the Augustenburg dynasty and the German nationalists as not having any effect on Frederick, who had not personally renounced anything and on whose behalf no one, including the father, was empowered to make renunciations. Frederick&#x27;s marriage in 1856 was part of an appeal to German nationalism (however, his younger brother married a daughter of Queen Victoria).
In November 1863 Frederick claimed the twin-duchies in succession after the death without a male heir of King Frederick VII of Denmark, who was also the Duke of Schleswig and Holstein. As Holstein was inherited after the salic law among descendants of Hedwig of Holstein, the independence movement had long nourished hopes that the king&#x27;s death would lead to their goal. The Kingdom of Denmark was also under so-called Semi-Salic Law, but its male line ended with Frederick VII and Danish law contained a Semi-Salic provision which resulted in the election of Christian of Glücksburg as new monarch. German nationalists claimed that Schleswig was also inherited according to the unmodified Salic Law, but this claim was refused by the Danish government, arguing that this province was subject to Danish law.

Otto von Bismarck used the turbulence to invade the duchies in a Second War of Schleswig. The rule of Denmark in the duchies was terminated, and Frederick triumphantly entered Kiel, where he was eagerly welcomed. However, numerous political complications arose which prevented the formal reinstatement of the dynasty. By the terms of the Treaty of Vienna (October, 1864), the duchies were relinquished to Prussia and Austria, to be disposed of by them. Prussia, however, imposed conditions upon Frederick which made it impossible for him to assume the government. After the Peace of Prague, which terminated the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the lands were finally absorbed into the Kingdom of Prussia.

Frederick subsequently served on the staff of the Crown Prince, Frederick William of Prussia, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. Frederick and his heirs continued to use their title, which after the next generation passed to the Glucksburg branch, to heirs of an elder brother of Christian IX of Denmark.

==Marriage and children==
On September 11, 1856 Frederick married Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a German. She was the second daughter of Ernst Christian Carl IV, Duke of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Princess Feodora of Leiningen, elder half-sister of Queen Victoria. They were parents to seven children:

#Prince &quot;Friedrich&quot; Wilhelm Victor Karl Ernst Christian August (August 3, 1857 – October 20, 1858).
#Princess &quot;Auguste Viktoria&quot; Friederike Luise Feodora Jenny (October 22, 1858 – April 11, 1921). Married Wilhelm II, German Emperor.
#Princess Victoria Friederike Augusta Maria &quot;Karoline Mathilde&quot; (January 25, 1860 – February 20, 1932). Married Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg
#Prince Friedrich Viktor Leopold Christian &quot;Gerhard&quot; (January 20, 1862 – April 11, 1862).
#Ernst Günther II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (August 11, 1863 – February 21, 1921).
#Princess Feodora &quot;Louise Sophie&quot; Adelheid Henriette Amalie (April 8, 1866 – April 28, 1952). Married Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia. He was a male-line great-grandson of Frederick William III of Prussia.
#Princess &quot;Feodora Adelheid&quot; Helene Luise Karoline Gustave Pauline Alice Jenny (July 3, 1874 – June 21, 1910).

<text>Mikhl Gelbart (August 21, 1889 – December 20, 1962) was an American composer of Yiddish songs. He was born in Ozorków, Poland. His music reflected a very American Yiddish motif, and was integral to the curricula of the Arbeter Ring (&quot;Workmen&#x27;s Circle&quot;) schools and camps.

He died in New York of bone cancer.

<text>A wrong or [[wrength]] (from Old English – &#x27;crooked&#x27;) is an act that is illegal or immoral. Legal wrongs are usually quite clearly defined in the law of a state or jurisdiction. They can be divided into civil wrongs and crimes (or &quot;criminal offenses&quot;) in common law countries, while civil law countries tend to have some additional categories, such as contraventions.

Moral wrong is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, rape or murder. Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law but are related to unethical behaviours. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as many types of parking offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs.

==Legal wrong==
A violation of law is any act (or, less commonly, failure to act) that fails to abide by existing law. Violations generally include both crimes and civil wrongs. Some acts, such as fraud, can violate civil and criminal laws. In law, a wrong can be a legal injury, which is any damage resulting from a violation of a legal right. A legal wrong can also imply being contrary to the principles of justice or law. It means that something is contrary to conscience or morality and results in treating others unjustly. If the loss caused by a wrong is minor enough, there is no compensation, which principle is known as &quot;de minimis non curat lex&quot;. Otherwise, damages apply.

The law of England recognised the concept of a &quot;wrong&quot; before it recognised the distinction between civil wrongs (governed by civil law) and crimes (defined by criminal law), which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century.

Civil law violations usually lead to civil penalties like fines, criminal offenses to more severe punishments.

The severity of the punishment should reflect the severity of the violation (retributive justice). In realistic situations and for minor violations, however, altruistic punishment was shown not &#x27;to fit the crime&#x27;. This subdivision is similar to the distinction between misdemeanours, and felonies.

Other examples of violations of the law include:

* Infraction, in United States law, minor or petty offenses that do not require jury trial. In common usage, &quot;violations&quot; are treated as synonymous with infractions
* Willful violation, in U.S. law, an act with intentional disregard for a regulation, statute, and policy
* Infringement, various violations of laws or rights, usually used in the context of intellectual property
** e.g. copyright violation
* Breach of contract
* Probation violation
* against traffic rules
** Moving violation, any violation of law committed by a driver while the vehicle is in motion
** Parking violation, parking a motor vehicle in a restricted place or an unauthorized manner

<text>Lappi is a cheese made from partially skimmed cow&#x27;s milk, very similar to Emmental except that it is pasteurized, and so is a little less flavorful, with smaller holes and a slightly firmer texture. It is so named because its recipe was developed in the Lapland region of Finland.

<text>Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt is a joint Australian and United States naval communication station located on the north-west coast of Australia, north of the town of Exmouth, Western Australia. The station is operated and maintained by the Australian Department of Defence on behalf of Australia and the United States and provides very low frequency (VLF) radio transmission to United States Navy, Royal Australian Navy and allied ships and submarines in the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean. The frequency is 19.8 kHz. With a transmission power of 1 megawatt, it is claimed to be the most powerful transmission station in the Southern Hemisphere.

The town of Exmouth was built at the same time as the communications station to provide support to the base and to house dependent families of United States Navy personnel.

==VLF transmitter masts==
The station features thirteen tall radio towers. The tallest tower is called &quot;Tower Zero&quot; and is tall, and was for many years the tallest human-made structure in the Southern Hemisphere. Six odd numbered outer towers T1–T11, located on an outer ring, each tall, are placed in a hexagon around Tower Zero. The other six even numbered inner towers T2–T12, which are each tall, are placed in a smaller hexagon around Tower Zero.
On 3 March 2009, the Defence Materiel Organisation advertised on the AusTender website a tender to construct two new roads at the station. The tender stated the 357 guy wires which support the 13 towers had exceeded their life expectancy and the roads will support the installation of the VLF guy wires. It states:
==History==

Garfield Barwick, Australian Minister for External Affairs, negotiated the lease on the US base at North West Cape in 1963 with US ambassador William Battle. The station was commissioned as US Naval Communication Station North West Cape on 16 September 1967 at a ceremony with the US Ambassador to Australia Edward A. Clark and the Prime Minister of Australia Harold Holt, at which peppercorn rent for the base for the first year was paid.

On 20 September 1968, the station was officially renamed to &quot;US Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt&quot; in memory of the late Prime Minister of Australia, who disappeared whilst swimming and was declared dead, presumed drowned, three months after the station was commissioned.

With the election of the Labor Government to power in 1972, Defence Minister Lance Barnard started negotiations on the condition of operation of the US military bases in Australia. On 9 January 1974 a joint statement by Lance Barnard and James Schlesinger, the US Secretary of Defense, assigned the Deputy Commander of the base to a Royal Australian Navy officer and gave Australian personnel roles in base technical and maintenance functions. The cipher room was closed to Australian scrutiny. The joint statement stressed the importance of consultations in crises. There was no undertaking given by the US to relay fire orders to their submarines bearing nuclear missiles.

In May 1974 several hundred people travelled to North West Cape from around Australia to protest and occupy the base and &quot;symbolically reclaiming it for the Australian people&quot;. During the occupation the Eureka Flag was flown over the base with 55 people arrested during the protest. Songs composed in the campaign against North West Cape and other US bases in Australia include &quot;We don&#x27;t want no Yankee Bases&quot; and &quot;Omega Doodle&quot; which have become part of the Australian folkloric tradition. From 1967 until October 1992 a USN Naval Security Group Detachment was stationed at the facility.

In Western Australian domestic politics, the presence of foreign military installations in the state has occasionally been questioned over the decades. The &quot;US&quot; was dropped from the station&#x27;s official title with the advent of joint United States and Royal Australian Navy operation in 1974. In 1991, an agreement was reached between the governments of Australia and the United States that would make the facility an Australian Naval Communication Station by 1999, a transition that began with a Royal Australian Navy officer taking command of the facility in 1992. The majority of US Naval presence ended in 1993 with the withdrawal of all US Naval personnel.

In July 2002, the Royal Australian Navy handed over operation of the station to the Defence Materiel Organisation. The base is currently operated under contract by Raytheon Australia. 

Harold E. Holt was identified as a potential Air Force Space Surveillance System (or &quot;Space Fence&quot;) site in 2011. On 6 December 2013 it was announced that the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST), part of the United States Space Surveillance Network, will be relocated to the Harold E. Holt Naval Communication Station from its initial deployment at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The SST 

A C-Band Space Surveillance Radar is also being installed and once completed will be operated remotely by Royal Australian Air Force personnel from No. 1 Remote Sensor Unit at RAAF Base Edinburgh. It will provide a Space Situational Awareness capability, allowing the tracking of space assets and debris.

==Aircraft interference controversy==
On 7 October 2008, Qantas Flight 72 made an emergency landing at Learmonth airport near the town of Exmouth, Western Australia following an inflight accident featuring a pair of sudden uncommanded pitch-down manoeuvres that resulted in serious injuries to many of the occupants. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) identified in a preliminary report that a fault occurred within the Number 1 Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and is the &quot;likely origin of the event&quot;. The ADIRUone of three such devices on the aircraftbegan to supply incorrect data to the other aircraft systems. The ATSB assessment of speculation that possible interference from Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt or passenger personal electronic devices could have been involved was &quot;extremely unlikely&quot;.

On 27 December 2008, another aircraft, Qantas Flight 71, also had a malfunction in its ADIRU. The incident again fuelled media speculation regarding the significance of the Harold E. Holt facility, with the Australian and International Pilots Association calling for commercial aircraft to be barred from the area as a precaution until the events are better understood, while the manager of the facility has claimed that it is &quot;highly, highly unlikely&quot; that any interference has been caused.

<doc id="276172" wikidata="Q908781" url="?curid=276172" title="Brendan Smyth">
<text>Brendan Smyth [[Premonstratensians|O.Praem]] (8 June 1927 – 22 August 1997) was a Catholic priest and convicted sex offender from Belfast, Northern Ireland, who became notorious as a child molester, using his position in the Catholic Church to obtain access to his victims. During a period of over 40 years, Smyth sexually abused and indecently assaulted at least 143 children in parishes in Belfast, Dublin and the United States. His actions were frequently hidden from police and the public by Roman Catholic officials. Controversy surrounding his case contributed to the downfall of the government of Republic of Ireland in December 1994.

==Early life and ordination==
Born John Gerard Smyth, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Smyth, upon joining the Norbertine Roman Catholic religious order in 1945, changed his name to Brendan. The Norbertines, also known as the &quot;Premonstratensians,&quot; were aware of Smyth&#x27;s crimes as early as the late 1970s, yet they did not report him to either the Garda Síochána or the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Smyth was moved from parish to parish and between dioceses and countries whenever allegations were made. In some cases, the order did not inform the diocesan bishop that Smyth had a history of sexual abuse and should be kept away from children. He abused children in parishes in Rhode Island and North Dakota and at one time worked in Boston, and was suspected of similar actions while on pastoral work in Wales and Italy. Norbertine Father Bruno Mulvihill made several attempts to alert church authorities about the abuse committed by Smyth.

==1994 arrest==
Smyth&#x27;s first conviction followed the reporting to police of his abuse of four siblings in Belfast&#x27;s Falls Road. After his arrest in 1991, he fled to the Republic of Ireland, where he spent the next three years on the run, staying mostly at Kilnacrott Abbey. This led to the collapse of the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government in December 1994 when the poor handling of an extradition request from the RUC by the Irish Attorney General&#x27;s office led to a further delay of Smyth&#x27;s trial. An award-winning UTV &quot;Counterpoint&quot; programme on the scandal by journalist Chris Moore, followed by a book, accused the head of the Norbertines and the Archbishop of Armagh of mishandling the case, and the Norbertines of negligence and a failure to tell others of Smyth&#x27;s crimes, enabling Smyth to sexually abuse large numbers of children for 40 years.

==Death==
Smyth died at 70 in prison of a heart attack in 1997 after collapsing in the exercise yard, one month into a 12-year prison sentence. The Norbertines held his funeral before dawn and covered his grave with concrete to deter vandalism. Smyth was buried in Kilnacrott Abbey, which was later put up for sale with of land, including the grave.

On 27 October 2005 the title &quot;Reverend&quot; was removed from his gravestone following a campaign by one of Smyth&#x27;s victims.

==Later investigations==
Reviewers of the case differ as to whether there was a deliberate plot to conceal Smyth&#x27;s behaviour, incompetence by his superiors at Kilnacrott Abbey, or some combination of factors. Cahal Daly, both as Bishop of Down and Connor, a diocese where some of the abuse took place, and later as Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh, is recorded as having been privately furious at the Norbertine &quot;incompetence&quot;. Smyth&#x27;s activities were investigated by the Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, finding that: &quot;..despite knowing his history of abusing children, the Norbertine religious order moved Smyth to different dioceses where he abused more children..&quot;

In 2010, Daly&#x27;s successor as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Cardinal Seán Brady, faced &quot;huge pressure to resign&quot; after he admitted that in 1975 he witnessed two teenage boys sign oaths of silence after testifying in a Church inquiry against Smyth. Survivors groups saw this as evidence of collusion, but Brady said he &quot;did not have the authority&quot; to turn Smyth in. On 17 March 2010, the Deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, called for Brady to resign.

In 2013, some of Smyth&#x27;s alleged Rhode Island victims between 1965 and 1968, both male and female, called for the Diocese of Providence to investigate Smyth. As of 2019, Smyth is among those listed by the Diocese of Providence as being &quot;credibly accused&quot; of committing sex abuse.

Module 6 of the 2014-2016 Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry is dedicated to Smyth&#x27;s crimes in Northern Ireland.

==Dramatisation==
A two-part dramatisation of the Smyth case, &quot;Brendan Smyth: Betrayal of Trust&quot;, was broadcast by the BBC on 13 March 2011 with Ian Beattie in the title role and Richard Dormer as Chris Moore.

<doc id="276174" wikidata="Q7804838" url="?curid=276174" title="Time-scale calculus">
<text>In mathematics, time-scale calculus is a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of differential equations, unifying integral and differential calculus with the calculus of finite differences, offering a formalism for studying hybrid systems. It has applications in any field that requires simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. It gives a new definition of a derivative such that if one differentiates a function defined on the real numbers then the definition is equivalent to standard differentiation, but if one uses a function defined on the integers then it is equivalent to the forward difference operator.

==History==

Time-scale calculus was introduced in 1988 by the German mathematician Stefan Hilger. However, similar ideas have been used before and go back at least to the introduction of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral, which unifies sums and integrals.

==Dynamic equations==
Many results concerning differential equations carry over quite easily to corresponding results for difference equations, while other results seem to be completely different from their continuous counterparts. The study of dynamic equations on time scales reveals such discrepancies, and helps avoid proving results twice—once for differential equations and once again for difference equations. The general idea is to prove a result for a dynamic equation where the domain of the unknown function is a so-called time scale (also known as a time-set), which may be an arbitrary closed subset of the reals. In this way, results apply not only to the set of real numbers or set of integers but to more general time scales such as a Cantor set.

The three most popular examples of calculus on time scales are differential calculus, difference calculus, and quantum calculus. Dynamic equations on a time scale have a potential for applications such as in population dynamics. For example, they can model insect populations that evolve continuously while in season, die out in winter while their eggs are incubating or dormant, and then hatch in a new season, giving rise to a non-overlapping population.

==Formal definitions==
A time scale (or measure chain) is a closed subset of the real line formula_1. The common notation for a general time scale is formula_2.

The two most commonly encountered examples of time scales are the real numbers formula_1 and the discrete time scale formula_4.

A single point in a time scale is defined as:
:formula_5

=== Operations on time scales===

The &quot;forward jump&quot; and &quot;backward jump&quot; operators represent the closest point in the time scale on the right and left of a given point formula_6, respectively. Formally:

:formula_7 (forward shift/jump operator)
:formula_8 (backward shift/jump operator)

The &quot;graininess&quot; formula_9 is the distance from a point to the closest point on the right and is given by:
:formula_10

For a right-dense formula_6, formula_12 and formula_13.
For a left-dense formula_6, formula_15

===Classification of points===

For any formula_16, formula_6 is:
* &quot;left dense&quot; if formula_18
* &quot;right dense&quot; if formula_19
* &quot;left scattered&quot; if formula_20
* &quot;right scattered&quot; if formula_21
* &quot;dense&quot; if both left dense and right dense
* &quot;isolated&quot; if both left scattered and right scattered

As illustrated by the figure at right:
* Point formula_22 is &quot;dense&quot;
* Point formula_23 is &quot;left dense&quot; and &quot;right scattered&quot;
* Point formula_24 is &quot;isolated&quot;
* Point formula_25 is &quot;left scattered&quot; and &quot;right dense&quot;

===Continuity===
Continuity of a time scale is redefined as equivalent to density. A time scale is said to be &quot;right-continuous at point formula_6&quot; if it is right dense at point formula_6. Similarly, a time scale is said to be &quot;left-continuous at point formula_6&quot; if it is left dense at point formula_6.

==Derivative==
Take a function:
:formula_30

(where R could be any Banach space, but is set to the real line for simplicity).

Definition: The &quot;delta derivative&quot; (also Hilger derivative) formula_31 exists if and only if:

For every formula_32 there exists a neighborhood formula_33 of formula_6 such that:
:formula_35
for all formula_36 in formula_33.

Take formula_38 Then formula_39, formula_40, formula_41; is the derivative used in standard calculus. If formula_42 (the integers), formula_43, formula_44, formula_45 is the forward difference operator used in difference equations.

==Integration==

The &quot;delta integral&quot; is defined as the antiderivative with respect to the delta derivative. If formula_46 has a continuous derivative formula_47 one sets

:formula_48

==Laplace transform and z-transform==

A Laplace transform can be defined for functions on time scales, which uses the same table of transforms for any arbitrary time scale. This transform can be used to solve dynamic equations on time scales. If the time scale is the non-negative integers then the transform is equal to a modified Z-transform:
formula_49

==Partial differentiation==

Partial differential equations and partial difference equations are unified as partial dynamic equations on time scales.

==Multiple integration==

Multiple integration on time scales is treated in Bohner (2005).

==Stochastic dynamic equations on time scales==

Stochastic differential equations and stochastic difference equations can be generalized to stochastic dynamic equations on time scales.

==Measure theory on time scales==

Associated with every time scale is a natural measure defined via

:formula_50

where formula_51 denotes Lebesgue measure and formula_52 is the backward shift operator defined on formula_1. The delta integral turns out to be the usual Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral with respect to this measure

:formula_54

and the delta derivative turns out to be the Radon–Nikodym derivative with respect to this measure

:formula_55

==Distributions on time scales==

The Dirac delta and Kronecker delta are unified on time scales as the &quot;Hilger delta&quot;:

: formula_56

==Fractional calculus on time scales==

Fractional calculus on time scales is treated in Bastos, Mozyrska, and Torres.

<doc id="276184" wikidata="Q1324974" url="?curid=276184" title="Elastography">
<text>Elastography is any of a class of medical imaging diagnostic methods that map the elastic properties and stiffness of soft tissue. The main idea is that whether the tissue is hard or soft will give diagnostic information about the presence or status of disease. For example, cancerous tumours will often be harder than the surrounding tissue, and diseased livers are stiffer than healthy ones.

The most prominent techniques use ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to make both the stiffness map and an anatomical image for comparison.

==Historical background==

Palpation is the practice of feeling the stiffness of a person&#x27;s or animal&#x27;s tissues with the health practitioner&#x27;s hands. Manual palpation dates back at least to 1500 BC, with the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus and Edwin Smith Papyrus both giving instructions on diagnosis with palpation. In ancient Greece, Hippocrates gave instructions on many forms of diagnosis using palpation, including palpation of the breasts, wounds, bowels, ulcers, uterus, skin, and tumours. In the modern Western world, palpation became considered a respectable method of diagnosis in the 1930s. Since then, the practice of palpation has become widespread, and it is considered an effective method of detecting tumours and other pathologies.

Manual palpation has several important limitations: it is limited to tissues accessible to the physician&#x27;s hand, it is distorted by any intervening tissue, and it is but not . Elastography, the measurement of tissue stiffness, seeks to address these challenges.

==How it works==
There are numerous elastographic techniques, in development stages from early research to extensive clinical application. Each of these techniques works in a different way. What all methods have in common is that they create a distortion in the tissue, observe and process the tissue response to infer the mechanical properties of the tissue, and then display the results to the operator, usually as an image. Each elastographic method is characterized by the way it does each of these things.

===Inducing a distortion===
To image the mechanical properties of tissue, we need to see how it behaves when deformed. There are three main ways of inducing a distortion to observe. These are:
* Pushing/deforming or vibrating the surface of the body (skin) or organ (prostate) with a probe or a tool,
* Using acoustic radiation force impulse imaging using ultrasound to remotely create a &#x27;push&#x27; inside the tissue, and
* Using distortions created by normal physiological processes, e.g. pulse or heartbeat.

===Observing the response===
The primary way elastographic techniques are categorized is by what imaging modality (type) they use to observe the response. Elastographic techniques use ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pressure/stress sensors in tactile imaging (TI) using tactile sensor(s). There are a handful of other methods that exist as well.

The observation of the tissue response can take many forms. In terms of the image obtained, it can be 1-D (i.e. a line), 2-D (a plane), 3-D (a volume), or 0-D (a single value), and it can be a video or a single image. In most cases, the result is displayed to the operator along with a conventional image of the tissue, which shows where in the tissue the different stiffness values occur.

===Processing and presentation===
Once the response has been observed, the stiffness can be calculated from it. Most elastography techniques find the stiffness of tissue based on one of two main principles:
* For a given applied force (stress), stiffer tissue deforms (strains) less than does softer tissue.
* Mechanical waves (specifically shear waves) travel faster through stiffer tissue than through softer tissue.
Some techniques will simply display the distortion and/or response, or the wave speed to the operator, while others will compute the stiffness (specifically the Young&#x27;s modulus or similar shear modulus) and display that instead. Some techniques present results quantitatively, while others only present qualitative (relative) results.

==Ultrasound elastography==
There are a great many ultrasound elastographic techniques. The most prominent are highlighted below.

===Quasistatic elastography / strain imaging===

Quasistatic elastography (sometimes called simply &#x27;elastography&#x27; for historical reasons) is one of the earliest elastography techniques. In this technique, an external compression is applied to tissue, and the ultrasound images before and after the compression are compared. The areas of the image that are least deformed are the ones that are the stiffest, while the most deformed areas are the least stiff. Generally, what is displayed to the operator is an image of the relative distortions (strains), which is often of clinical utility.

From the relative distortion image, however, making a &quot;quantitative&quot; stiffness map is often desired. To do this requires that assumptions be made about the nature of the soft tissue being imaged and about tissue outside of the image. Additionally, under compression, objects can move into or out of the image or around in the image, causing problems with interpretation. Another limit of this technique is that like manual palpation, it has difficulty with organs or tissues that are not close to the surface or easily compressed.

===Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI)===

Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) uses ultrasound to create a qualitative 2-D map of tissue stiffness. It does so by creating a &#x27;push&#x27; inside the tissue using the acoustic radiation force from a focused ultrasound beam. The amount the tissue along the axis of the beam is pushed down is reflective of tissue stiffness; softer tissue is more easily pushed than stiffer tissue. ARFI shows a qualitative stiffness value along the axis of the pushing beam. By pushing in many different places, a map of the tissue stiffness is built up. Virtual Touch imaging quantification (VTIQ) has been successfully used to identify malignant cervical lymph nodes.

===Shear-wave elasticity imaging (SWEI)===
In shear-wave elasticity imaging (SWEI), similar to ARFI, a &#x27;push&#x27; is induced deep in the tissue by acoustic radiation force. The disturbance created by this push travels sideways through the tissue as a shear wave. By using an image modality like ultrasound or MRI to see how fast the wave gets to different lateral positions, the stiffness of the intervening tissue is inferred. Since the terms &quot;elasticity imaging&quot; and &quot;elastography&quot; are synonyms, the original term SWEI denoting the technology for elasticity mapping using shear waves is often replaced by SWE. The principal difference between SWEI and ARFI is that SWEI is based on the use of shear waves propagating laterally from the beam axis and creating elasticity map by measuring shear wave propagation parameters whereas ARFI gets elasticity information from the axis of the pushing beam and uses multiple pushes to create a 2-D stiffness map. No shear waves are involved in ARFI and no axial elasticity assessment is involved in SWEI. SWEI is implemented in supersonic shear imaging (SSI).

===Supersonic shear imaging (SSI)===

Supersonic shear imaging (SSI) gives a quantitative, real-time two-dimensional map of tissue stiffness. SSI is based on SWEI: it uses acoustic radiation force to induce a &#x27;push&#x27; inside the tissue of interest generating shear waves and the tissue&#x27;s stiffness is computed from how fast the resulting shear wave travels through the tissue. Local tissue velocity maps are obtained with a conventional speckle tracking technique and provide a full movie of the shear wave propagation through the tissue. There are two principal innovations implemented in SSI. First, by using many near-simultaneous pushes, SSI creates a source of shear waves which is moved through the medium at a supersonic speed. Second, the generated shear wave is visualized by using ultrafast imaging technique. Using inversion algorithms, the shear elasticity of medium is mapped quantitatively from the wave propagation movie. SSI is the first ultrasonic imaging technology able to reach more than 10,000 frames per second of deep-seated organs. SSI provides a set of quantitative and in vivo parameters describing the tissue mechanical properties: Young&#x27;s modulus, viscosity, anisotropy.

This approach demonstrated clinical benefit in breast, thyroid, liver, prostate, and musculoskeletal imaging. SSI is used for breast examination with a number of high-resolution linear transducers. A large multi-center breast imaging study has demonstrated both reproducibility and significant improvement in the classification of breast lesions when shear wave elastography images are added to the interpretation of standard B-mode and Color mode ultrasound images.

===Transient elastography===
In the food industry, low-intensity ultrasonics has already been used since the 1980s to provide information about the concentration, structure, and physical state of components in foods such as vegetables, meats, and dairy products and also for quality control, for example to evaluate the rheological qualities of cheese.

Transient elastography was initially called time-resolved pulse elastography when it was introduced in the late 1990s. The technique relies on a transient mechanical vibration which is used to induce a shear wave into the tissue. The propagation of the shear wave is tracked using ultrasound in order to assess the shear wave speed from which the Young&#x27;s modulus is deduced under hypothesis of homogeneity, isotropy and pure elasticity (E=3ρV²). An important advantage of transient elastography compared to harmonic elastography techniques is the separation of shear waves and compression waves. The technique can be implemented in 1D and 2D which required the development of an ultrafast ultrasound scanner.

Transient elastography gives a quantitative one-dimensional (i.e. a line) image of &quot;tissue&quot; stiffness. It functions by vibrating the skin with a motor to create a passing distortion in the tissue (a shear wave), and imaging the motion of that distortion as it passes deeper into the body using a 1D ultrasound beam. It then displays a quantitative line of tissue stiffness data (the Young&#x27;s modulus). This technique is used mainly by the Fibroscan system, which is used for liver assessment, for example, to diagnose cirrhosis. A specific implementation of 1D transient elastography called VCTE has been developed to assess average liver stiffness which correlates to liver fibrosis assessed by liver biopsy. This technique is implemented in a device which can also assess the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) which is good surrogate marker of liver steatosis.

==Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)==
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) was introduced in the mid-1990s, and multiple clinical applications have been investigated. In MRE, a mechanical vibrator is used on the surface of the patient&#x27;s body; this creates shear waves that travel into the patient&#x27;s deeper tissues. An imaging acquisition sequence that measures the velocity of the waves is used, and this is used to infer the tissue&#x27;s stiffness (the shear modulus). The result of an MRE scan is a quantitative 3-D map of the tissue stiffness, as well as a conventional 3-D MRI image.

One strength of MRE is the resulting 3-D elasticity map, which can cover an entire organ. Because MRI is not limited by air or bone, it can access some tissues ultrasound cannot, notably the brain. It also has the advantage of being more uniform across operators and less dependent on operator skill than most methods of ultrasound elastography.

MR elastography has made significant advances over the past few years with acquisition times down to a minute or less and has been used in a variety of medical applications including cardiology research on living human hearts. MR elastography&#x27;s short acquisition time also makes it competitive with other elastography techniques.

== Optical elastography ==
Optical elastography is an emerging technique that utilizes optical microscopy to obtain tissue images. The most common form of optical elastography, optical coherence elastography (OCE), is based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), which combines interferometry with lateral beam scanning for rapid 3D image acquisition and achieves spatial resolutions of 5-15 μm. For OCE, a mechanical load is applied to the tissue and the resultant deformation is measured using speckle tracking or phase sensitive detection. Early implementations of OCE involved applying a quasi-static compression to the tissue, though more recently dynamic loading has been achieved through the application of a sinusoidal modulation via a contact transducer or acoustic wave. Other imaging modalities with greater optical resolution have also been introduced for optical elastography to probe the microscale between cells and whole tissues. OCT relies on longer wavelengths, of 850 - 1050 nm, and therefore provides a lower optical resolution compared to common light microscopy, which uses visible wavelengths of 400-700 nm, and provides lateral spatial resolutions of &lt;1 μm. Examples of higher resolution analysis include the use of confocal and light-sheet microscopy respectively for mechanical characterization of multicellular spheroids and for structural analysis of 3D organoids at a single-cell resolution. When using these imaging modalities, quasi-static compression may be induced in the tissue sample by a micro-indentation device, such as a microtweezer. The resultant deformation can be measured from the microscopy images using image-based nodal tracking algorithms, and mechanical properties can be discerned using finite element method (FEM) analyses. 

==Applications==

Elastography is used for the investigation of many disease conditions in many organs. It can be used for additional diagnostic information compared to a mere anatomical image, and it can be used to guide biopsies or, increasingly, replace them entirely. Biopsies are invasive and painful, presenting a risk of hemorrhage or infection, whereas elastography is completely noninvasive.

Elastography is used to investigate disease in the liver. Liver stiffness is usually indicative of fibrosis or steatosis (fatty liver disease), which are in turn indicative of numerous disease conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis. Elastography is particularly advantageous in this case because when fibrosis is diffuse (spread around in clumps rather than continuous scarring), a biopsy can easily miss sampling the diseased tissue, which results in a false negative misdiagnosis.

Naturally, elastography sees use for organs and diseases where manual palpation was already widespread. Elastography is used for detection and diagnosis of breast, thyroid, and prostate cancers. Certain types of elastography are also suitable for musculoskeletal imaging, and they can determine the mechanical properties and state of muscles and tendons.

Because elastography does not have the same limitations as manual palpation, it is being investigated in some areas for which there is no history of diagnosis with manual palpation. For example, magnetic resonance elastography is capable of assessing the stiffness of the brain, and there is a growing body of scientific literature on elastography in healthy and diseased brains.

In 2015, preliminary reports on elastography used on transplanted kidneys to evaluate cortical fibrosis have been published showing promising results.
In Bristol University&#x27;s study Children of the 90s, 2.5% of 4,000 people born in 1991 and 1992 were found by ultrasound scanning at the age of 18 to have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; five years later transient elastography found over 20% to have the fatty deposits on the liver of steatosis, indicating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; half of those were classified as severe. The scans also found that 2.4% had the liver scarring of fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis.
Other techniques include elastography with optical coherence tomography (i.e. light).

Tactile imaging involves translating the results of a digital &quot;touch&quot; into an image. Many physical principles have been explored for the realization of tactile sensors: resistive, inductive, capacitive, optoelectric, magnetic, piezoelectric, and electroacoustic principles, in a variety of configurations.

==Notes==
:† In the case of endogenous motion imaging, instead of inducing a disturbance, disturbances naturally created by physiological processes are observed.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamp]]s and [[postal history]] of [[Switzerland]].

== History ==
The first stamps used in Switzerland were issued by the cantons of Zürich (1843), Geneva (1843) and Basel (1845) for their own use, with the first federal issues coming several years later, on April 7, 1850.

By March 19, 1798, the Helvetic Republic had come into being; although it was not until September 1798 that the entire country was conquered. According to Napoleon, the country was &quot;liberated&quot; to form itself into a new State, which assumed the title of &quot;Republique Helvetique Une et Indivisible.&quot; And, the Republic was administratively reorganized into twenty-two (22) Cantons. Later, that number was reduced to nineteen (19) due to mergers and to some changes at the frontiers. In September 1798, all postal mail was ordered to be &quot;a natural and necessary property of the state&quot; or, in modern parlance, nationalization was ordered.

Thus, the cantonal and private mail services were taken over. The country was then divided into five postal districts as follows: Berne, where Fischer Posts were entrusted with the administration of the mails; Basel; Zürich; St. Gallen; and Schaffhausen, where the administration was left in the hands of three mail farmers because of their close association with the Thurn and Taxis mails. The first Republican Decree of the Helvetic State relating to postal matters was one of suppressing the old and colorful cantonal uniforms worn by the letter carriers, and As a symbol of national service, a new uniform was issued in the Republican colors of green, red and yellow

Swiss stamps are inscribed with the word Helvetia, rather than &quot;Schweiz&quot;, &quot;Suisse&quot; &quot;Svizzera&quot;, or &quot;Svizra&quot;. With four official languages - German, French, Italian, and Romansch. The Swiss would have had to put all four languages on each stamp, quite a problem to overcome with such limited space on a stamp. Switzerland is officially known by the Latin name &quot;Confoederatio Helvetica&quot; for historical reasons. &quot;Confoederatio&quot; means &quot;confederation&quot; and &quot;Helvetica&quot; is a reference to the Helvetians, a Celtic tribe that lived in Switzerland when the Romans invaded. The English equivalent of the Latin name is &quot;Swiss Confederation.&quot; Hence, the use of &quot;Helvetia&quot; on stamps.

== Pre-stamp mail and cantonal Issues ==
The first Swiss stamps were those of the Cantons (States) of Zürich, Geneva, and Basel. These early Swiss stamps have another distinction. They were also the 3rd (1843), 4th (1843), and 5th (1845) adhesive postage stamp issuing nations of the World. Unfortunately, the Cantonal postage stamp issues are tremendously rare today.

=== Basel ===
 Basel issued their own stamp, the &quot;Basel Dove&quot; in 1845. This was a 2½-rappen value featuring a white embossed dove carrying a letter in its beak, and inscribed &quot;STADT POST BASEL&quot;, a design by the architect Melchior Berry. It is printed in black, crimson, and blue, making it the world&#x27;s first tri-colored stamp. A first printing in light green instead of the chosen blue was first believed to be a proof, but now acknowledged as first trial printing.

=== Berne ===
In 1675, Beat Fischer von Reichenbach was granted permission to operate a private postal service in Bern, Switzerland. The building next to the Berne Minster Gothic Chapel in Berne was used as a post office from 1675 to 1883. The service was named for him &quot;Fischerpost&quot;. The service operated until 1832. Beat Fischer von Reichenbach was knighted by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor for establishing postal services between Germany and Spain. In 1975 a postage stamp dedicated to Beat Fischer von Reichenbach was issued in Switzerland.

In June 1799, the Seat of Government was transferred to Berne. A thorough reorganization took place at that time, and the post mark was changed to &quot;Central Post Adminst. (for Central Post Administration). Therefore, there were two types of postmarks. Berne has a small 20 x 24 mm. mark which reads &quot;Helvt. Republ. at top and &quot;Central Post Bureau&quot; at bottom, and in the center a &quot;E&quot; (for Eingegangen, received) and a &quot;V&quot; ( for Versandt, sent out). In the Lucerne marking, there was a line below the wording, and in the one used in Berne a small &quot;posthorn&quot; appeared. The post horn is synonymous in parts of Europe with the mail, and images of the instrument are still often used as a symbol of the post office. Postmen would often improvise or play well-known melodies on the horn to entertain those along their delivery. This even resulted in some reprimands from their superiors to stop playing “vulgar” opera arias that the post office thought undignified. The postal clerks were told to put a handwritten manuscript date after the &quot;E&quot; indicating the date the letter was received; yet there are examples of covers (envelopes) where the dates had not been filled in as ordered.

There are of course, recognized misprints called &quot;Freaks&quot; Some Bern covers dated June to December 1799, with the Central Post Bureau wording, and one cover that was dated July 1799, from Lucerne with the postmark applied in red ink; although the use of red ink had been curtailed earlier. The red ink was used in Lucerne from November 1798 to January 1799, when it was replaced with vermillion ink. The next time red ink markings would be found again would be on Berne post markings. This may indicate that when the Seat of the Government was changed, the red ink was taken from Lucerne to Berne for use there; but, perhaps at the last minute, a contingency developed and it was possibly also simultaneously used in Lucerne for a very short period.

=== Geneva ===

On September 30, 1843, Geneva issued their first stamps: the &quot;Double Geneva&quot;, which was the world&#x27;s first postage stamp in green colour. Like the first Zürich issue, it consisted of pairs of stamps; these were each printed in black on yellow-green paper, depicting the city&#x27;s arms, and inscribed &quot;Poste de Genềve&quot; at the top and &quot;Port local&quot; at the bottom. But, an additional inscription, reading &quot;10 PORT CANTONAL Cent&quot; ran across the top of each pair. The idea was that the user could cut out a single stamp to pay the intra-commune rate, and a pair to make up the inter-commune rate. Only 6,000 of the doubles were ever printed, and , intact used doubles typically go for around US$60,000 at auction. Very rarely, horizontally inverted pairs, and even more rarely, vertical pairs, can be found and are greatly sought after by collectors with values reaching sometimes US$150&#x27;000 to US$200&#x27;000 at auction.

In 1845, Geneva switched to conventional single 5c stamps. In 1849 it printed a 4c stamp featuring the federal cross, and similar 5c designs in 1850 and 1851.

=== Lucerne ===
Lucern was chosen as the headquarters seat for mail. All mail was handled through the Central Post Bureau, which was under the authority of the Minister of Finance All letters were handed into the central bureau for sorting and forwarding. At the bureau they received the first Helvetic Republic postmarks. Because all Postal Departments were in Lucerne, the volume of official correspondence was extremely heavy there; but purely private letters were quite rare. Such letters from Lucerne bore the title, &quot;Central Post Bureau.&quot; These are known to have existed from November 1798 to July 1799.

=== Zürich ===

On March 1, 1843, Zürich issued their first stamps, the Zürich 4 and 6, making it the second type of stamp in the world, after the UK&#x27;s Penny Black three years earlier. The issue consisted of two imperforate stamps printed separately, each in five types, in sheets of 100, one with a large numeral &quot;4&quot; and the other with a &quot;6&quot;, both inscribed &quot;Zürich&quot; at the top. The 4-rappen stamp was also inscribed &quot;LOCAL-TAXE&quot; at the bottom, since it was intended to pay for letters mailed within a city, while the 6-rappen, inscribed &quot;CANTONAL-TAXE&quot;, was for use with letters going anywhere in the canton. The design was lithographed in black by Orell, Fuessli, and Company, with a pattern of fine red lines underneath, to discourage counterfeiting. Initially the red line were vertical, but starting in 1846 they were printed horizontal. These stamps were popular from the start, but were not printed in large numbers and are quite scarce today, with values ranging from US$1,500 to $20,000 depending on type. With the exception of one 6-rappen block of 9 (3x3) later split into a block of 6 (3x2) and a strip of three, all sheets were cut horizontally, so that no vertical pairs or larger are known to exist today.

Canton of Zürich also issued a stamp in 1850, known to collectors as the Winterthur issue, depicting the Swiss federal cross and a posthorn, which served as a transitional issue until the stamps of the Swiss federal government made their appearance later that same year (see under Geneva above).

== Federal issues ==
===Local mail and rayon stamps===


The adoption of the federal constitution in 1848 made it practical to issue confederation-wide stamps, and the first of these came out in 1850 (the exact date is uncertain). All used the same basic design, a Swiss cross surmounted by a posthorn, but there were a number of variations. The local-rate stamps had a value of 2½ rappen, with some inscribed &quot;ORTS-POST&quot; (German) and &quot;POSTE LOCALE&quot; (French). This was the first of many multi-language issues. For longer-distance mail, the 5-rappen stamp was inscribed &quot;RAYON I&quot; and the 10-rappen (for a greater distance) &quot;RAYON II&quot;. Initially the stamps were issued with a black frame separating the white cross from the red background, but as a technically incorrect rendition of the Swiss arms, these were withdrawn.

In 1852 a 15-rappen/centime value inscribed &quot;RAYON III&quot; was issued, using the same design as previously, but printed entirely in vermilion. The &quot;zone&quot; (Rayon) system, in which the letter paid according to the distance travelled was later abolished: a fixed price took the mail to anywhere within Switzerland.

=== Helvetias ===
The classical definitive Swiss stamps were issued between 1854 and 1862, and were known as the Strubel Issues. They are the most popular specialization subject for most serious classical Swiss philatelists. Officially, these stamps are called The Imperforate Sitting Helvetia Issues of 1854–1862. These stamps feature a seated figure of Helvetia wearing a laurel wreath. She holds a spear in her right arm, and her left arm is resting on a shield, emblazoned with the arms of the Helvetic Confederation. The effect given by the shape of the wreath around her embossed head caused many German speaking collectors to jokingly refer to the design as &quot;Strubel&quot;, referring to the visual effect of Helvetia having &quot;unkempt&quot; or &quot;frizzy&quot; hair. The nickname for these issues stuck, and just about every collector of Swiss stamps now refers to them as &quot;The Strubels&quot;. This series of stamps have many, different variations including differing inks, paper, and paper thickness. Colored silk threads were used as a security device in the papers used to print the definitive Swiss stamps of 1854–1862.

All of the preceding issues were declared invalid on 1 October 1854, and replaced with the seated allegorical figure &quot;Helvetia&quot;, the first of several issues known as &quot;seated Helvetias&quot;. The figure was embossed but only the outline was colored, making it rather hard to pick out. This was the first issue to deal with the multiple languages of Switzerland; in addition to the word &quot;FRANCO&quot; at the top, the other three sides listed the denomination in rappen, centimes, and (Italian) centesimi. The issue was also notable for the use of a colored silk thread running horizontally through the paper, as an anti-counterfeiting measure. (In the illustration to the left, the thread is faintly visible about 1/3 of the distance from the bottom of the stamp, looking almost like a crease.)

A number of values were printed between 1854 and 1862, ranging from 5 rappen to 1 franc, and philatelists distinguish them further by type of paper and color of thread. The commonest type surviving today is the 5-rappen brown on thick paper with a green thread, costing US$20 used; certain other types are rare, and the pale yellow-green shade of the 40-rappen value will go for $7,000 or more.

A new design with more legible seated Helvetia appeared in 1862, now sporting a &quot;watermark&quot; consisting of a cross inside an ellipse (not a true watermark because it was impressed into the paper after printing), and for the first time, perforations. The units of currency disappeared, with &quot;HELVETIA&quot; inscribed at the top and &quot;FRANCO&quot; at the bottom. Initially printed on white wove paper, the stamps switched to granite paper in 1881. (The paper has red and blue silk threads, clearly visible in the larger image of the stamp to the left.) The stamps continued in use until 1883; many of them are common and cheaply available today, although legitimate cancellations on the granite paper varieties are uncommon because of the short period of use.

In 1882, the low value stamps (up to 15c) were numerals, while the higher values featured a &quot;Standing Helvetia&quot;. These continued in use, with a number of variations in color, perforation, and paper, until 1907. 1900 saw Switzerland&#x27;s first commemorative stamps, a set of three values issued for the 25th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union, with an allegorical design featuring various symbols of communication.

===20th century===
A new definitive series in 1907 showed William Tell&#x27;s son holding a crossbow and an apple pierced by an arrow for values below 10c, a bust of Helvetia for 10c to 15c values, and another seated Helvetia for higher values.
The William Tell&#x27;s son design (by Albert Welti) went through several redrawings, including a temporary move of the bowstring in front of the crossbow&#x27;s stock. From 1914 on, a portrait of William Tell himself was used for values between 10c and 30c. Also in 1914, the first of many scenic stamps were issued. The 5fr depicted the Rütli meadow, while the 3fr and 10fr stamps showed the Mythen and Jungfrau mountains, respectively.

The first semi-postal stamp was issued in 1913, but regular annual issues did not start until 1915. For many years an issue of 3-5 stamps came out on 1 December each year, until 1972.

A set of three stamps in 1919 celebrated peace at the end of World War I. Stamp printing experienced some difficulties during this period, and a variety of surcharges were needed in 1915 and 1921. The UPU was noted on its 50th anniversary in 1924 with two stamps, one depicting its building in Bern and the other the location of the 1874 Congress.

In about 1930 Switzerland began to use &quot;grilled gum&quot;, a light grill applied along the gum to counteract the tendency for gummed stamps to curl. The grill is most obvious on mint stamps, but is faintly visible on used stamps as well. This was abandoned around 1944.

The next definitive series was a set of scenic views issued in 1934. The designs were typographed, resulting in a vigorous albeit somewhat crude-looking appearance, and they were superseded by engraved versions of the same basic designs, beginning in 1936. Several commemorative issues appeared in the 1930s, then in 1941 came new definitives honoring Swiss military heroes. Another definitive set in 1945 marked the end of the war; the higher values of this were issued in small numbers, and are relatively expensive today. The definitive series of 1949 depicted achievements of Swiss technology. Since that time, Swiss stamps have generally followed a regular pattern; an issue of about four commemoratives on a single date in the spring, and a similar group in the fall, as well as a Europa issue, usually in the spring. Starting in the 1980s, there have been additional themed issues; for instance, in 1993 an issue of four stamps featured works of art by Swiss women.

<text>The genus Pholisma (Nutt. ex Hook.) consists of three species of desert-dwelling, primarily subterranean plants. &quot;Pholisma&quot; belongs to the family Boraginaceae.

Most notable of the genus is &quot;Pholisma sonorae&quot;, native to the Southwestern United States and Mexico. The species is without chlorophyll and lives as a parasite on the roots of a number of desert species. Other species include &quot;Pholisma arenarium&quot;, the &quot;desert Christmas tree&quot;, and &quot;Pholisma culiacana&quot;.

<text>Masters of Deception (MOD) was a New York–based group of hackers, most widely known in media for their exploits of telephone company infrastructure and later prosecution.

==Origin of Masters of Deception==

MOD&#x27;s initial membership grew from meetings on Loop-Around Test Lines that led to collaborations to hack RBOC phone switches and the various minicomputers and mainframes used to administer the telephone network. They successfully remained underground using alternative handles to hide even their true hacker identities.

Acid Phreak founded the Masters of Deception with Scorpion and HAC. The name itself was, among other things, a mockery of Legion of Doom (LOD), as &#x27;M&#x27; is one letter up in the alphabet from &#x27;L&#x27;, although the name originally was a flexible acronym that could be used to identify membership in situations where anonymity would be the best course of action. It could stand for &quot;Millions of Dollars&quot; just as easily as &quot;Masters of Deception.&quot;

It is claimed that the mockery of the LOD name was a statement to the underground that LOD had lost its direction. Several LOD members were close friends of MOD who had been raided and indicted by the government, causing the majority of those who remained to drop out of the underground for safety reasons. In their absence, LOD largely fell into disarray causing the disagreement and disillusionment that led Phiber Optik to align himself with MOD in an effort to restore the direction of the spirit of underground hacking.

==Members of MOD==
The original Masters of Deception included: Mark Abene (&quot;Phiber Optik&quot;), Paul Stira (&quot;Scorpion&quot;), Elias Ladopoulos (&quot;Acid Phreak&quot;), HAC, John Lee (&quot;Corrupt&quot;) and Julio Fernandez (&quot;Outlaw&quot;).

Additional members who have remained anonymous include: Supernigger (also of DPAK), Wing, Nynex Phreak, Billy_The_Kid, Crazy Eddie, The Plague, ZOD, Seeker, Red Knight (who was also a member of Cult of the Dead Cow), Lord Micro, n00gie and peaboy (a.k.a. MCI Sprinter).
==Philosophy==
Masters of Deception operated differently in many respects to previous hacking groups. Although they openly shared information with each other, they took a controversial view on sharing information outside the group. It was believed that access to MOD&#x27;s knowledge should be earned via degrees of initiation and a proven respect for the craft, rather than releasing powerful information into the wild where it could be used for nefarious purposes. A demonstration of responsibility on the part of the initiate was required. This informal compartmentalized protection of more sensitive knowledge was a structure originally employed by LOD in the 1980s, rather successfully. According to Lex Luthor, &quot;I realized early on that only certain people can be trusted with certain information, and certain types of information can be trusted to no one. Giving out useful things to irresponsible people would inevitably lead to whatever thing it was being abused and no longer useful. I was very possessive of my information and frequently withheld things from my articles.&quot;

==Fall of MOD==
As a result of a major nationwide investigation by a joint FBI/Secret Service task force, five of MOD&#x27;s members were indicted in 1992 in federal court. The case was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of New York by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephen Fishbein and Geoffrey S. Berman. Within the next six months (in 1993), all five pleaded guilty and were sentenced to either probation or prison. After the sentencing of Abene, &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot;, Winter 1993-94, had on its cover a rag doll labeled &quot;BERMAN&quot; stabbed by a dagger.

== In popular culture ==
* Singer/songwriter Poe referenced the MOD with the phrase &quot;MOD are you out there?&quot; from her 1995 song &quot;Hello&quot;.

<text>The Euchites or Messalians were a Christian sect from Mesopotamia that spread to Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) and Thrace. The name &#x27;Messalian&#x27; comes from the Syriac , &quot;mṣallyānā&quot;, meaning &#x27;one who prays&#x27;. The Greek translation is , &quot;euchitēs&quot;, meaning the same.

== History ==
They are first mentioned in the 370s by Ephrem the Syrian, Epiphanius of Salamis, and Jerome, and are also mentioned by Archbishop Atticus, Theodotus of Antioch, and Archbishop Sisinnius. They were first condemned as heretical in a synod of 383 AD (Side, Pamphylia), whose was referred to in the works of Photius. Their leader was supposedly a man named Peter who claimed to be Christ. Before being stoned to death for his blasphemies, he promised his followers that after three days he would rise from his tomb in the shape of a wolf, attracting the title of &quot;Lycopetrus&quot; or &quot;Peter the Wolf&quot;. Christians believed it was not Peter who would come out of the grave, but a devil in disguise.

They continued to exist for several centuries, influencing the Bogomils of Bulgaria, who are called &quot;Lycopetrians&quot; in an abjuration formula of 1027. and, thereby, the Bosnian Church and Catharism. By the 12th century the sect had reached Bohemia and Germany and, by a resolution of the Council of Trier (1231), was condemned as heretical.

Michael Psellos, a Byzantine monk, accused Bogomils and Euchites of orgiastic practices, incest, and homosexuality. Furthermore, he argued that children born from these promiscuous activities were brought before a Satanic assembly after eight days, offered up to Satan and then cannibalistically eaten. This cannibalistic act was supposedly a parody of baptism. Euthymios Zigabenos, a later Byzantine monastic writer, would make the same accusations. Such charges have a long history, and historians debate whether they are truthful to any degree: the idea of these unholy acts can be traced back further to alleged practices of certain Gnostic sects; indeed, a similar literary tradition regarding heresies seems to have been brought into existence well before the Christian era, during the reign of the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes.

Modern scholarship has also questioned whether a coherent heretical movement existed behind these condemnations, and has emphasised instead the friction in the Eastern Church caused by Messalianism&#x27;s &quot;ascetical practices and imagistic language far more characteristic of Syriac Christianity than of the imperial Church centred on Constantinople&quot;.

==Teachings==
The sect&#x27;s teaching asserted that:

# The essence (ousia) of the Trinity could be perceived by the carnal senses.
# The Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis (substance) in order to unite with the souls of the perfect.
# God has taken different forms in order to reveal himself to the senses.
# Only such sensible revelations of God confer perfection upon the Christian.
# The state of perfection, freedom from the world and passion, is therefore attained solely by prayer, not through the church, baptism and or any of the sacraments, which have no effect on the passions or the influence of evil on the soul (hence their name, which means &quot;Those who pray&quot;).
Messalians taught that once a person experienced the essence of God they were freed from moral obligations or ecclesiastical discipline. They had male and female teachers, the &quot;perfecti&quot;, whom they honored more than the clergy. The condemnation of the sect by John Damascene and Timothy of Constantinople, expressed the view that the sect espoused a sort of mystical materialism. Their critics also accused them of incest, cannibalism and &quot;debauchery&quot; (in Armenia, their name came to mean &quot;filthy&quot;) but scholars reject these claims.

==In Mandaean texts==
Gelbert (2013, 2023) suggests that in the Ginza Rabba (Right Ginza 9.1), the Mandaic term &quot;minunaiia&quot; (&quot;Mnunaeans&quot; or &quot;Minunaeans&quot;) is actually a reference to the Messalians or Euchites.

<text>The &quot;Letter to The Grand Duchess Christina&quot; is an essay written in 1615 by Galileo Galilei. The intention of this letter was to accommodate Copernicanism with the doctrines of the Catholic Church. Galileo tried to use the ideas of Church Fathers and Doctors to show that any condemnation of Copernicanism would be inappropriate.

==Background==

Christina was the daughter of Charles III of Lorraine and granddaughter of Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

In 1611 Galileo was informed by a friend, Cigoli, that &quot;ill-disposed men envious of your virtue and merits met [to discuss]... any means by which they could damage you.&quot; The number of scholars who disagreed with his &quot;Discourse on Floating Bodies&quot;, or were simply ill-disposed toward Galileo grew, but other than one letter from Niccolò Lorini there was not much discussion about the issue for the remainder of the year.

Late in 1613, Galileo&#x27;s former student Benedetto Castelli, a Benedictine monk and lecturer in mathematics at the University of Pisa, wrote to Galileo about the events at a recent breakfast in Pisa with the Grand Duke Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici. In the course of conversation at the breakfast Cosimo Boscaglia, a professor of philosophy, argued that the motion of the Earth could not be true, being contrary to the Bible. After breakfast ended, Castelli was called back to answer scriptural arguments against the motion of the Earth from Christina. Castelli took on the role of theologian in response, and convinced everyone there except the Duchess (who he thought was arguing mainly to hear his answers) and Boscaglia (who said nothing during this dialogue). Galileo decided to address Christina because of her desire to learn more about astronomy. Christina&#x27;s position of power would also give the letter more exposure to other nobles and Church leaders.

Galileo replied to Castelli with a long letter laying out his position on the relation between science and Scripture. By 1615, with the controversy over the Earth&#x27;s motion becoming more widespread and increasingly dangerous, Galileo revised this letter and greatly expanded it; this became the &quot;Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina&quot;. The letter circulated in manuscript but was not printed until much later, after the Inquisition had condemned Galileo. It appeared in Strasbourg in 1636 with both Italian and Latin text. It was suppressed in Catholic jurisdictions, as were all works of Galileo at that period which dealt with that subject.

==Contents of letter==
Galileo establishes two main premises before addressing his conclusion.

# God has created Scripture and nature. They cannot contradict each other.
# Nature is independent of accommodation, but Scripture is produced to accommodate.

Galileo argued that the Copernican theory was not just a mathematical calculating tool, but a physical reality. The letter includes a direct paragraph in which Galileo wrote:
 This approach caused some, including Dominican friar Niccolò Lorini, to complain to the Inquisition, which in 1616 condemned Copernicanism as philosophically absurd and contrary to scripture. Much later the Inquisition tried Galileo himself and in 1633 condemned him of suspicion of heresy.

Throughout the letter, Galileo includes quotes from St. Augustine. For example, he cites, &quot;If anyone shall set the authority of Holy Writ against clear and manifest reason, he who does this knows not what he has undertaken; for he opposes to the truth not the meaning of the Bible, which is beyond his comprehension, but rather his own interpretation, not what is in the Bible, but what he has found in himself and imagines to be there.&quot;

=== Doctrine of Accommodation ===
Galileo argues that the Bible is written in a way that is accessible to even uneducated people. Therefore, every word in the Bible cannot be taken literally. He cites an example in which God is described as having hands, which St. Augustine elucidated as not being literal. Further, Galileo cites Cardinal Baronio: &quot;[The] intention of the Holy Spirit is to teach us how one goes to heaven and not how heaven goes.&quot;

=== Queen of sciences ===
Galileo was writing this letter in the context of an ongoing debate about the relationship between theology and philosophy. From medieval times, theology was known as the queen of sciences. Galileo reinterprets this phrase to distinguish the areas of theology vs philosophy. He rejects the belief that theology is the queen because it includes knowledge of all scientific fields. Instead, he says that theology is the queen because it is a vehicle to the highest knowledge of attaining salvation.

==Methodology of the letter==
Galileo starts the letter with a little flattery of the Grand Duchess. He tries to build her up as an authority figure and then presents his own credentials to show that he has similar authority. Since the Grand Duchess was a person of high authority but did not have much knowledge in the field of astronomy, Galileo wrote the letter in a manner understandable to a layperson. He attempts to attain the sympathy of the Duchess by mentioning the unfair attacks made against his honor. He tried to portray &quot;himself as a man of good will who seeks only to disclose the truth.&quot; He states he was motivated to write the letter to justify himself to men of religion he holds in great esteem. The letter can also be seen as a political move for Galileo since having a highly influential and powerful figure on his side would benefit him.

==Joshua argument==
Critics of the Copernican system used the Battle of Gibeon from the tenth chapter of the Book of Joshua as scriptural evidence against heliocentrism. In the chapter, Joshua asks God to stop the Sun in order to lengthen the day and allow the Israelites to win the battle. When taken literally, this story implies that the Sun is mobile.

Galileo adopts an Augustinian perspective, while also marginalizing it later. In the &quot;Letter to the Grand Duchess&quot; he references Augustine of Hippo’s work &quot;De Genesi ad Litteram&quot;, which calls for either a compromise between literal translation of scripture and astronomy or an allegorical standpoint, which could resolve future astronomical conflicts arising that could jeopardize the validity of the Bible.

Whereas his critics took the stopping of the Sun to mean that Sun halts its orbit around the Earth, Galileo interpreted it with a different astronomical viewpoint. He claimed that God stopped the rotation of the Sun rather than its supposed orbital motion. Arguing that the rotation of the Sun drives the entire planetary system, including the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis, he concluded that when God stopped the Sun from spinning, this also stopped the Earth&#x27;s rotation and so lengthened the day, as Joshua wished. Galileo thus argued that his Copernican reading of the Joshua passage was in fact more literal than the traditional geocentric reading. Galileo did not, however, see this as real evidence in favor of Copernicanism, but simply as a debating point: even if we played by his opponents&#x27; rules and gave scientific weight to literal readings of scripture, Copernicanism still won out.

In summary, Galileo accepted the authority of scriptural passages, as long as they are properly interpreted.

==Reception==

Galileo wrote the letter to the Grand Duchess in an effort to convince her of the compatibility of Copernicanism and Scripture. This served as a treatise under the disguise of a letter, with the purpose of addressing the politically powerful, as well as his fellow mathematicians and philosophers. The goal of the secondary audience was targeted to whom he believed was condemning Copernicus. The failure of this stratagem was that he used Christina as his titular audience, instead of the shadow audience he truly sought to persuade. The result was that he was attempting to move an audience unfamiliar with his chosen topic, instead of those who were already disposed on the topic of the movement of the heavens.

&quot;With his deprecating tone Galileo effectively marks off a group of philosophers and theologians as adversaries whose faults he proceeds to define&quot;. Within that group were progressive Aristotelians, including Bishop Dini, Cardinals Bellarmine and Barberini, as well as famous Jesuit astronomers at the Collegio Romano (Roman College). These men were open to scientific demonstration to progress Copernicus&#x27; theories, however Galileo attacks them stating that they &quot;determine in &#x27;hypocritical zeal&#x27; to preserve at all costs what they believe, rather than admit what is obvious to their eyes.&quot; This compounds his problems rather than aiding him. Moreover, his letter misses out on key facts that include the Church&#x27;s non-attacking stance on Copernicus when the canon proposed his heliocentric model. A Dominican theologian Tolosani made an unpublished attack on the Copernican system as early as 1544.

Furthermore, the tone of the letter was combative and overly proud. &quot;Many resented his arrogant tone, his presumption for speaking on theological matters, and for crossing over from the world of mathematical astronomy into the world of natural philosophy.&quot; 
&quot;But he has ruined himself by being so much in love with his own genius and having no respect for others. One should not wonder that everyone conspires to damn him.&quot;

<text>Zhang He () (died July or August 231), courtesy name Junyi, was a military general serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He continued serving in the state of Cao Wei under its first two rulers, Cao Pi and Cao Rui, during the Three Kingdoms period until his death.

Zhang He began his career under Han Fu, the governor of Ji Province, in the 180s when he joined the Han imperial forces in suppressing the Yellow Turban Rebellion. He became a subordinate of the warlord Yuan Shao in 191 after Yuan Shao seized the governorship of Ji Province from Han Fu. Throughout the 190s, Zhang He fought in the battles against Yuan Shao&#x27;s northern rival, Gongsun Zan. In 200, Zhang He initially fought on Yuan Shao&#x27;s side at the Battle of Guandu against Cao Cao, a warlord who controlled the Han central government. However, he defected to Cao Cao after Yuan Shao&#x27;s defeat at Guandu in the same year. Since then, he had fought in several wars under Cao Cao&#x27;s banner, including the campaigns against Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs and allies (201–207), the expeditions in northwestern China (211–214), and the battles around Hanzhong (215–219). After Cao Cao&#x27;s death in 220, Zhang He served in Wei and fought in battles against Wei&#x27;s rival states, Shu Han and Eastern Wu. His best known victory was at the Battle of Jieting in 228, in which he defeated the Shu general Ma Su by cutting off the enemy&#x27;s access to water supplies and then attacking them. In 231, he was killed in an ambush laid by Shu forces during the Battle of Mount Qi while he was reluctantly pursuing a retreating enemy force.

Chen Shou, who wrote the third-century historical text &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, named Zhang He as one of the Five Elite Generals of his time, alongside Yu Jin, Yue Jin, Zhang Liao and Xu Huang.

==Service under Han Fu and Yuan Shao==
Zhang He was from Mao County (), Hejian State (), which is in present-day Maozhou, Hebei. Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, when the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out, he responded to the Han government&#x27;s call for volunteers to serve in the army and help suppress the revolt. He was commissioned as a Major () and placed under the command of Han Fu, the Inspector of Ji Province (present-day southern Hebei).

In 191, after Han Fu relinquished his control of Ji Province to the warlord Yuan Shao, Zhang He came to serve Yuan Shao and was promoted to the rank of Colonel (). Between 191 and 199, Zhang He fought on Yuan Shao&#x27;s side in the war between Yuan Shao and his rival Gongsun Zan. In 199, after Yuan Shao had eliminated Gongsun Zan at the Battle of Yijing, Zhang He was further promoted to General of the Household Who Brings Peace to the State () for his achievements in battle.

==Battle of Guandu==
In the year 200, Yuan Shao fought the Battle of Guandu with Cao Cao, a warlord who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian. When Yuan Shao having a few advantages like a far larger army in the initial stages of the campaign, Zhang He suggested that he avoid direct confrontation with Cao Cao and instead send a light cavalry force south to attack the rear of Cao Cao&#x27;s camp. Yuan Shao did not heed Zhang He&#x27;s suggestion and attacked his foe&#x27;s main force instead. In the first few battles of the campaign, Cao Cao&#x27;s forces won several victories in which two of Yuan Shao&#x27;s generals, Yan Liang and Wen Chou, were killed and no progress was made in overrunning Cao Cao&#x27;s defenses.

===Raid on Wuchao===
Yuan Shao had sent his general Chunyu Qiong to guard his army&#x27;s supply depot at Wuchao (烏巢; southeast of present-day Yanjin County, Henan). One night, Cao Cao led a raid on Wuchao to destroy Yuan Shao&#x27;s supplies.

When news of the attack on Wuchao reached Yuan Shao&#x27;s camp, Zhang He advised Yuan Shao: &quot;Cao Cao&#x27;s forces are well-trained so they will definitely defeat Chunyu Qiong. If Chunyu Qiong is defeated, all is lost for you, General. You should immediately dispatch forces to reinforce Wuchao.&quot; Yuan Shao&#x27;s adviser Guo Tu disagreed with Zhang He: &quot;Zhang He&#x27;s idea isn&#x27;t right. Why don&#x27;t we attack Cao Cao&#x27;s main camp instead? He will definitely head back to defend his camp. In this way, we can stop the attack on Wuchao without having to send reinforcements there.&quot; Zhang He replied: &quot;Cao Cao&#x27;s camp is well-defended and can&#x27;t be conquered easily. If Chunyu Qiong is taken captive, we will all become prisoners-of-war.&quot;

Yuan Shao dispatched a detachment of light cavalry to reinforce Wuchao and sent heavily armed forces to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s main camp. Cao Cao succeeded in destroying Yuan Shao&#x27;s supplies at Wuchao, while his main camp successfully resisted Yuan Shao&#x27;s attacks. Cao Cao scored an overall decisive victory over Yuan Shao in the battle.

===Defecting to Cao Cao&#x27;s side===
Guo Tu felt embarrassed after seeing that his suggestion had resulted in Yuan Shao&#x27;s defeat, so he attempted to divert attention away from himself by accusing Zhang He of displaying &quot;schadenfreude&quot; upon learning of their defeat. Zhang He became afraid when he heard about this, so he defected to Cao Cao&#x27;s side.

Cao Cao was very pleased when Zhang He came to join him and he told Zhang He: &quot;In the past, Wu Zixu failed to understand the situation and met his downfall. What if he had abandoned Yin like Weizi and defected to Han like Han Xin?&quot;

The fifth-century historian Pei Songzhi pointed out a discrepancy between Zhang He&#x27;s biography and the biographies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao about the time when Zhang He defected to Cao Cao&#x27;s side. According to Cao Cao&#x27;s and Yuan Shao&#x27;s biographies, Yuan Shao sent Zhang He and Gao Lan () to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s main camp per Guo Tu&#x27;s suggestion. They defected to Cao Cao when they learnt that Wuchao was lost, and their defection resulted in Yuan Shao&#x27;s defeat. Based on these two accounts, Zhang He defected to Cao Cao &quot;before&quot; Yuan Shao&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Guandu. On the other hand, Zhang He&#x27;s biography mentioned that Zhang He defected to Cao Cao &quot;after&quot; Yuan Shao&#x27;s defeat at Guandu and after Guo Tu slandered him.

==Service under Cao Cao==
After his defection, Zhang He was appointed by the Han imperial court (under Cao Cao&#x27;s control) as a Lieutenant-General () and enfeoffed as a Marquis of a Chief Village (). Between 200 and 207, he fought on Cao Cao&#x27;s side against Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs and allies at the battles of Ye (204), Bohai (205) and Liucheng (207). He was promoted to General Who Pacifies the Di () for his contributions.

In 206, Zhang He participated in the campaign against pirate forces led by Guan Cheng () in Donglai Commandery (東萊郡; around present-day Yantai and Weihai, Shandong).

In 209, after the Battle of Red Cliffs, Chen Lan () and Mei Cheng () started a rebellion in Lu County (六縣; in present-day Lu&#x27;an, Anhui). Cao Cao ordered Zhang Liao to lead a force to suppress the revolt. Zhang He and Niu Gai () served as Zhang Liao&#x27;s deputies and succeeded in eliminating the rebels.

===Campaigns in northwestern China===
In 211, Zhang He participated in the Battle of Weinan against a coalition of warlords from the Guanzhong region led by Ma Chao and Han Sui. The coalition broke up after Cao Cao defeated the warlords in the battle. Cao Cao sent Zhang He to lead a force to attack one of the warlords, Yang Qiu, at Anding Commandery (安定郡; covering parts of present-day Ningxia and Gansu), and Zhang succeeded in forcing Yang Qiu to surrender.

In 212, Zhang He accompanied Xiahou Yuan on a campaign against another of the warlords, Liang Xing (), and the Di tribes in Wudu Commandery (武都郡; in present-day Longnan, Gansu). In 214, Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He defeated Ma Chao, who had borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery after being driven out of Guanzhong. They also eliminated rebel forces led by Song Jian ().

===Battles in Hanzhong===
In 215, when Cao Cao launched a campaign against Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, he first sent Zhang He to lead an army ahead to attack Liang Xing () and the Di tribal king, Dou Mao (). He ordered Zhang He to lead 5,000 infantry to clear the path after entering Hanzhong via San Pass (散關; southwest of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi). After receiving Zhang Lu&#x27;s surrender, Cao Cao headed back and left behind Xiahou Yuan, Zhang He and other generals to defend Hanzhong from his rival Liu Bei, who controlled Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) directly south of Hanzhong.

Later that year, Zhang He tried to relocate the residents of Ba to Hanzhong. He was defeated by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Zhang Fei at Dangqu (宕渠; in present-day Qu County, Sichuan) and abandoned his horse and escaped on foot via a shortcut with only a few of his men. He retreated back to Nanzheng County with his remaining troops. He was promoted to General Who Defeats Bandits () later.

In 218, Liu Bei launched a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong from Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. He garrisoned his forces at Yangping Pass (陽平關; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi) while Zhang He stationed his troops at Guangshi (). Liu Bei divided his thousands of elite soldiers into ten groups and ordered them to attack Zhang He&#x27;s position at night. Zhang He personally led his men to resist Liu Bei&#x27;s forces and succeeded in holding off the enemy. In the meantime, Liu Bei set fire to the fences at Zhang He&#x27;s camp in Zouma Valley (). Xiahou Yuan led some soldiers to put out the fire and encountered Liu Bei&#x27;s force along the way and engaged the enemy. Xiahou Yuan was killed in action while Zhang He retreated. According to the &quot;Weilüe&quot;, Liu Bei was fearful that Xiahou Yuan would be replaced by Zhang He as the commander of Cao Cao&#x27;s forces in Hanzhong. He also expressed disappointment after learning that it was Xiahou Yuan, and not Zhang He, who was killed in battle.

Cao Cao&#x27;s forces in Hanzhong were shocked when they learnt of their commander&#x27;s death and became worried that Liu Bei might take advantage of the situation to press on the attack. Guo Huai, a Major who served under Xiahou Yuan, expressed support for Zhang He to be the new commander. He said: &quot;General Zhang (He) is a famous general in the Empire. Even Liu Bei is afraid of him. He is the only person capable of restoring stability in this hour of peril.&quot; Zhang He assumed the role and reorganised his forces. The other officers were all willing to submit to his command. Stability was restored.

Cao Cao, who was then in Chang&#x27;an, sent a messenger to Hanzhong to approve Zhang He&#x27;s command. In the following year, he personally led an army to Hanzhong to reinforce Zhang He. Liu Bei ordered his forces to remain in their positions in the mountainous regions and refused to engage Cao Cao in battle. Cao Cao eventually gave up on Hanzhong and led his forces out. Zhang He was relocated to a garrison at Chencang (陳倉; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi).

==Service under Cao Pi==
Cao Cao died in March 220 and was succeeded by his son Cao Pi as the King of Wei (). Cao Pi promoted Zhang He to General of the Left () and increased his marquis rank to Marquis of a Chief District (). Later that year, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty and established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the new emperor. After his coronation, he promoted Zhang He from a district marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Mao&quot; ().

In 221, Cao Pi ordered Zhang He and Cao Zhen to lead forces to attack the Lushuihu and Eastern Qiang tribes in Anding Commandery (安定郡; covering parts of present-day Ningxia and Gansu).

===Battle of Jiangling===
In 222, Cao Pi summoned Zhang He and Cao Zhen for an audience with him in the Wei capital Luoyang, and then ordered them, Xiahou Shang and other generals to lead armies to attack Jiangling County, which was controlled by Wei&#x27;s rival state, Eastern Wu. During the battle, Zhang He supervised the Wei forces as they captured an island on the Yangtze River and started constructing a small castle on it. The battle had an inconclusive overall result because the Wei forces withdrew on their own without making any significant gains.

==Service under Cao Rui==
Cao Pi died in 226 and was succeeded by his son Cao Rui as the emperor of Wei. Cao Rui ordered Zhang He to garrison in Jing Province to defend Wei&#x27;s southern border from Eastern Wu. Later on, Zhang He and Sima Yi led troops to attack Wu forces commanded by Liu E () and defeated them at Qikou ().

===Repelling the first Shu invasion===
In 228, Zhuge Liang, the regent of Wei&#x27;s rival state Shu Han, led the Shu forces on the first of a series of campaigns to attack Wei. Zhang He was recalled back from Jing Province to defend Wei&#x27;s western borders in the Guanzhong region (covering areas in present-day Gansu and Shaanxi) from the Shu armies. Later that year, he defeated the Shu general Ma Su at the Battle of Jieting by first cutting off the enemy&#x27;s access to water supplies and then attacking them.

Earlier that year, three Wei-controlled commanderies – Nan&#x27;an (南安; in present-day Dingxi, Gansu), Tianshui and Anding (安定; covering parts of present-day Ningxia and Gansu) – had responded to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s call and defected to Shu. Zhang He attacked the three commanderies and took them back for Wei. Cao Rui issued an imperial decree to praise Zhang He for his success in repelling the Shu invasion and reward him by adding 1,000 taxable households to his marquisate. Zhang He had 4,300 households in his marquisate after the increment.

===Aborted campaign against Wu===
Around the time, the Wei general Sima Yi, who was training naval forces in Jing Province, planned for an invasion of Wu via the Han River, which links to the Yangtze River. Cao Rui ordered Zhang He to lead forces from the Guanzhong region to Jing Province to support Sima Yi. However, when they arrived in Jing Province, it was already in winter and the waters were unsuitable for the larger ships to sail on, hence the campaign was aborted. Zhang He then returned to his garrison at Fangcheng County (方城縣; present-day Gu&#x27;an County, Hubei).

===Predicting the outcome of the Siege of Chencang===
In late 228, Zhuge Liang launched a second campaign against Wei and besieged the Wei fortress at Chencang (陳倉; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi), which was defended by Hao Zhao. Cao Rui summoned Zhang He back to the capital Luoyang to discuss plans to counter the Shu invasion but they met in Henan instead. Cao Rui placed Zhang He in command of 30,000 troops and reassigned some of the Imperial Guards to serve as Zhang&#x27;s bodyguards. He asked Zhang He: &quot;General, if you&#x27;re late, will Zhuge Liang have already captured Chencang?&quot;

Zhang He predicted that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s forces could not maintain the siege on Chencang for long because they lacked supplies. He replied: &quot;Zhuge Liang will have already left before I even reach Chencang. I estimate he has less than 10 days worth of supplies.&quot; He then led his troops towards Nanzheng County, travelling day and night. The Shu forces retreated. Cao Rui summoned Zhang He back to Luoyang and commissioned him as General of Chariots and Cavalry Who Attacks the West ().

===Death===

In 231, when Zhuge Liang launched his fourth invasion of Wei, Cao Rui ordered Sima Yi and Zhang He to lead Wei forces west to counter the invasion. When Zhang He&#x27;s army arrived in Lueyang County, Zhuge Liang retreated to Mount Qi (the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu) to defend his position. When Sima Yi ordered Zhang He to pursue the enemy, Zhang He refused and said that according to classical military doctrine, they should not pursue an enemy force returning to its base. Sima Yi insisted, so Zhang He had no choice but to pursue the retreating Shu forces. He fell into an ambush at Mumen Trail (木門道; near present-day Mumen Village, Mudan Town, Qinzhou District, Tianshui, Gansu) and died after a stray arrow hit him in the thigh. Cao Rui granted him the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Zhuang&quot; (), which literally means &quot;robust marquis&quot;.

==Family==
Zhang He had four sons, who were all enfeoffed as marquises by Cao Rui in recognition of their father&#x27;s contributions to Wei. The eldest, Zhang Xiong (), inherited his father&#x27;s title and became the next Marquis of Mao (). The youngest son, whose name is unknown, received the peerage of a Secondary Marquis ().

==Appraisal==
Zhang He was described to be a resourceful and proficient military leader who was well versed in geography and capable of making accurate predictions about war situations, to the point where even Zhuge Liang was wary of him. Even though he served in the military, he highly respected Confucian scholars. He once recommended Bei Zhan (), a learned scholar who was known for his good moral conduct and who was from the same hometown as him, to serve in the Wei government. Cao Rui accepted Zhang He&#x27;s suggestion and appointed Bei Zhan as an Academician (). He also issued an imperial decree to praise Zhang He for not only defending Wei&#x27;s borders, but also showing concern for the internal preservation of Wei.

==In popular culture==
Zhang He is a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. He also appears in all instalments of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; strategy game series.

In the collectible card game &quot;&quot; there is a card named &quot;Zhang He, Wei General&quot; in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set.

He appears as a unique character in Total War: Three Kingdoms .

<text>Gan Ning () ( early 170s - c. 220), courtesy name Xingba, was a Chinese military general serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Originally a notorious pirate, he gave up the life of a marauder in the late 190s and became a subordinate of Huang Zu, the Administrator of a commandery in present-day east-central Hubei. Disheartened by Huang Zu&#x27;s indifferent attitude towards him, Gan Ning eventually left Huang and made his way into Wu territory (present-day eastern and southeastern China), where he found his calling and became a military officer under the warlord Sun Quan. Throughout his years of service under Sun Quan until his death, Gan Ning fought in numerous battles for his lord, including the battles of Jiangxia (208), Red Cliffs (208–209), Xiaoyao Ford (214–215) and Ruxu (217).

== Early life ==
Gan Ning was from Linjiang County (臨江縣), Ba Commandery (巴郡), which is in present-day Zhong County, Chongqing. His ancestral home was actually in Nanyang, Henan; his ancestors migrated to Ba Commandery and settled there. When he was still a youth, he accepted an offer to serve as an accounting assistant in the local commandery office. He resigned and went home after serving for a short period of time.

In his younger days, Gan Ning was known to be very energetic and eager to behave like a &quot;youxia&quot; or vigilante. He gathered a group of wayward young men under his leadership to rob and plunder for a living. They armed themselves with bows and crossbows, wore feathers in their hats and tied bells on their bodies. The ringing of the bells alerted people to the presence of Gan Ning and his gang. Gan Ning&#x27;s plundering and murderous ways made him infamous throughout Ba Commandery. On land, he and his gang travelled by riding on horses or in chariots in a certain formation; on water, they sailed on light vessels linked together. They also wore elaborate and flamboyant garments to attract attention. When they stopped at a certain location, they used silk to tie their boats to the jetties; when they were departing, they cut the silk and abandoned it as a display of their extravagance.

Among those who had dealings with Gan Ning were some local officials. They treated Gan Ning generously. In return, he befriended them and showed genuine feelings towards them. On the other hand, those who treated him badly suffered the fate of being robbed of their possessions by him and his gang. Even government officials were not spared. Gan Ning led the life of a marauder until he was over 20 years old.

After Liu Yan, the governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), died in 194, Gan Ning rebelled against his son and successor, Liu Zhang. He received support from Liu He (劉闔), an official from the neighbouring Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), and Liu Zhang&#x27;s subordinates Shen Mi (沈彌) and Lou Fa (婁發). However, they failed and were forced to flee to Jing Province.

==Service under Liu Biao and Huang Zu==
Gan Ning eventually decided to stop plundering and pillaging. He read some books and picked up ideas from the Hundred Schools of Thought. Later, he brought along 800 men to join Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), and was stationed in Nanyang Commandery. Liu Biao had a scholarly background and was not proficient in military affairs. Around the time, chaos had broken out all around China as contending warlords fought each other for territorial gains and hegemony over the empire. Gan Ning observed that Liu Biao was doomed to failure and was worried that he would be affected, so he and his followers planned to head east towards the Wu (or Jiangdong) region, which was under the control of the warlord Sun Ce and later Sun Quan. When they reached Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; present-day eastern Hubei) in eastern Jing Province, they could not cross the border into Wu territory as Sun Quan was at war with Liu Biao at the time. Gan Ning thus remained at Jiangxia and became a subordinate of the commandery administrator, Huang Zu, who did not recognise his talent and treated him coldly for three years.

In 203, Sun Quan led his forces to attack Huang Zu and defeated him at the Battle of Xiakou. Gan Ning, a skilled archer, led a detachment of troops as backup and came to Huang Zu&#x27;s rescue. He fired an arrow which killed Ling Cao, a colonel under Sun Quan, thus saving Huang Zu&#x27;s life. Huang Zu did not change his attitude towards Gan Ning after the incident. Su Fei (蘇飛), an area commander under Huang Zu, recommended Gan Ning as a talent but Huang Zu ignored him. Huang Zu even attempted to induce Gan Ning&#x27;s followers to abandon their leader and join him instead; some of them agreed.

Gan Ning was very unhappy with Huang Zu and wanted to leave him, but was worried that Huang Zu would not allow it so he felt very frustrated. Su Fei understood Gan Ning&#x27;s frustration so he invited him for drinks and said: &quot;I recommended you to Huang Zu many times, but he doesn&#x27;t want to make good use of your talents. As days pass, people grow older. You should make plans for your future and find someone who truly appreciates your talents.&quot; Gan Ning paused for a moment before replying: &quot;That&#x27;s what I have in mind, but I can&#x27;t find an excuse to leave.&quot; Su Fei then said: &quot;I will suggest to Huang Zu to appoint you as the chief of Zhu County (邾縣; northwest of present-day Huanggang, Hubei). Although it may be a difficult start, it will eventually become easier for you to decide where to go from there.&quot; After Huang Zu approved Su Fei&#x27;s suggestion, Gan Ning gathered a few hundred men who were willing to follow him and headed towards Zhu County. From there, they crossed the border into the Jiangdong territories.

==Battle of Jiangxia==
When Gan Ning brought his followers to Jiangdong, Zhou Yu and Lü Meng recommended him as a talent to their lord, Sun Quan. Sun Quan felt that Gan Ning was an extraordinary man and treated him like an old friend. Gan Ning proposed: 

Sun Quan wanted to follow Gan Ning&#x27;s plan, but his adviser Zhang Zhao strongly objected: &quot;The territories in Wu have not been completely pacified yet. If we proceed with this campaign, I am afraid there will be chaos.&quot; Gan Ning rebuked Zhang Zhao: &quot;Our lord has entrusted responsibilities to you as if you were Xiao He. If you can&#x27;t even be confident that there won&#x27;t be chaos under your watch, how can you expect to be like Xiao He?&quot; Sun Quan then raised his glass to Gan Ning and said: &quot;Xingba, I have decided to put you in charge of the campaign this year just as I offer this drink to you. You should strive your best to come up with a strategy to defeat Huang Zu. Once you have proven yourself, you won&#x27;t need to take Zhang Zhao&#x27;s words to heart.&quot;

In the spring of 208, Sun Quan led his forces west to attack Huang Zu at Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) and succeeded in defeating and capturing Huang Zu alive, as well as taking control over his troops. Gan Ning was placed in command of some soldiers and ordered to garrison at Dangkou (當口).

Sometime in the late 200s to early 210s, Gan Ning were involved in a revolt orchestrased by some officials against the newly ascended Liu Zhang, whose father who had just passed away. Liu Zhang sent Zhao Wei (趙韙), a key ally of his late father, to march on the rebels and managed to suppress the rebels and forced them to flee into Jingzhou (荊州) in the east.

===Saving Su Fei===
Before the campaign, Sun Quan had prepared two boxes for containing the heads of Huang Zu and Su Fei (蘇飛). After the battle, Su Fei, who had become a prisoner-of-war, immediately asked someone to inform Gan Ning. Gan Ning said: &quot;If Su Fei didn&#x27;t say anything, I would have forgotten about him.&quot; Later, when Sun Quan and his officers were celebrating the victory, Gan Ning left his seat and knelt down before Sun Quan. He kowtowed until his face was covered in blood and, with tears in his eyes, he pleaded with Sun Quan: &quot;I owe Su Fei a favour. If not for him, I&#x27;d have been dead and my body abandoned in a ravine. I&#x27;d not have been able to serve under you. Now, even though Su Fei&#x27;s actions warrant death, I still hope you can spare him.&quot; Sun Quan was moved and he asked: &quot;What if he leaves after I spare his life?&quot; Gan Ning replied: &quot;Su Fei will be grateful if he is spared from death. He won&#x27;t leave even if you try to chase him away. Why would he still court his own doom? If he really does that, I am willing to use my head to replace his in the box.&quot; Sun Quan then pardoned Su Fei.

==Red Cliffs campaign==
In the winter of 208–209, Gan Ning fought in the Battle of Red Cliffs under Zhou Yu&#x27;s command against the forces of Cao Cao, and defeated the enemy at Wulin (烏林). He also participated in the subsequent Battle of Jiangling. Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, led by Zhou Yu, attacked Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren at Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jiangling County, Hubei) but were unable to conquer the city. Gan Ning suggested that he lead a separate force to capture Yiling (夷陵; around present-day Yichang, Hubei). He had only a few hundred soldiers with him when he reached Yiling but the strength of his army increased to around 1,000 after he recruited some men in the area. Cao Ren sent 5,000 to 6,000 troops to besiege Gan Ning at Yiling. Cao Ren&#x27;s men built high towers, from which they rained arrows upon Yiling. Gan Ning&#x27;s men were terrified but their commander remained calm. He sent a messenger to request aid from Zhou Yu, who heeded Lü Meng&#x27;s plan and led reinforcements to help Gan Ning while leaving behind Ling Tong to defend their position. Zhou Yu, Lü Meng and the others succeeded in lifting the siege at Yiling, while Ling Tong managed to hold his ground well for that period of time. Eventually, Cao Ren was ordered to abandon Nan Commandery because the prolonged war had drained much manpower and resources on Cao Cao&#x27;s side, and this resulted in the capture of the commandery by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces.

==Guan Yu&#x27;s shallows==
In 215, Sun Quan had disputes with his ally Liu Bei over the division of southern Jing Province between their respective domains. Sun Quan sent Lü Meng and Ling Tong to seize the three commanderies of Changsha (長沙), Lingling (零陵; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (桂陽; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) from Liu Bei, and then ordered Lu Su to station at Yiyang as a precaution against any retaliation by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, who was in charge of his lord&#x27;s territories in southern Jing Province. Gan Ning joined Lu Su at Yiyang. Guan Yu claimed he had 30,000 troops as he selected 5,000 elite troopers to the upstream shallows located some 10 &quot;li&quot; away from Yiyang, and planned to cross the shallows at night. Lu Su held a discussion with his subordinates on how to deal with Guan Yu. At the time, Gan Ning had only 300 men under him and he told Lu Su,

&quot;If you give me another 500 troops, I will go to confront Guan Yu. I assure you that Guan Yu won&#x27;t dare to cross the waters when he hears of my approach. But if he does, I will capture him.&quot;

Lu Su then chose 1,000 troops and put them under Gan Ning&#x27;s command. Gan Ning headed towards Guan Yu&#x27;s position at night. As Gan Ning expected, Guan Yu did not cross the shallows and instead set up camps there. That place was thus named &#x27;Guan Yu&#x27;s Shallows&#x27; (關羽瀨).

Sun Quan was so pleased with Gan Ning&#x27;s achievement that he appointed him as the Administrator (太守) of Xiling Commandery (西陵郡) and let him oversee the counties of Yangxin (陽新) and Xiazhi (下雉; east of present-day Yangxin County, Hubei).

==Battle of Xiaoyao Ford==
In early 215, Gan Ning was involved in an attack on Cao Cao&#x27;s garrison at Wan County (皖縣; in present-day Qianshan County, Anhui) and was in charge of the unit assigned to scale the fortress&#x27;s walls. Armed with a chain, he was the first to climb up the walls and his men captured Wan County&#x27;s defending commander, Zhu Guang (朱光). Lü Meng earned the top credit while Gan Ning received the second highest credit for the victory. Gan Ning was promoted to General Who Breaks and Charges (折衝將軍).

Later that year, Gan Ning participated in Sun Quan&#x27;s campaign to seize control of Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Zhang Liao. Sun Quan was unable to capture Hefei after besieging the city for days and suffering defeats in the initial skirmishes, and he eventually withdrew his forces when a plague broke out in his army. Sun Quan&#x27;s other units retreated first, while Sun Quan himself remained behind at Xiaoyao Ford (逍遙津) with only about 1,000 men and a few officers (including Lü Meng, Jiang Qin, Ling Tong and Gan Ning). When Zhang Liao saw that, he seized the opportunity to launch a devastating counterattack and throw the enemy into confusion. Gan Ning led a group of archers to fire arrows at the enemy while Ling Tong and the others fought fiercely to protect their lord. Gan Ning shouted at the men to beat the war drums and blow the horns loudly to raise the army&#x27;s morale. Sun Quan eventually succeeded in escaping but his forces sustained heavy losses. He praised Gan Ning for his acts of courage after the battle.

== Battle of Ruxu ==

Two years later in 217, Cao Cao personally led an army, said to be 400,000 strong, to attack Sun Quan&#x27;s garrison at Ruxu (濡須). Sun Quan led about 70,000 troops to counter the enemy. Gan Ning commanded the 3,000 strong vanguard. Sun Quan gave a secret order for Gan Ning to attack the enemy under the cover of nightfall, so Gan Ning selected 100 elite soldiers. Before the battle, Sun Quan sent food and wine to Gan Ning and his men. After the feast, Gan Ning poured wine into a silver bowl and drank two bowls before offering it to an officer. The officer knelt down and did not dare to take the bowl, so Gan Ning drew his sword, placed it on his lap and said: &quot;You respect our lord but not me? I don&#x27;t fear death. Why do you fear death?&quot; The officer saw that Gan Ning was very stern so he obliged and drank from it and then ordered each soldier to drink one bowl of wine.&quot;

When it was nearing midnight, Gan Ning and his 100 men raided Cao Cao&#x27;s camp and destroyed some defensive structures and killed dozens of enemy soldiers. Cao Cao&#x27;s troops were shocked so they sounded the alarm and lit up the entire camp with torches. By then, Gan Ning and his men had already returned safely to their own camp, where they beat their drums, blew their horns, and shouted &quot;&quot;wansui&quot;!&quot;

Later that night, Gan Ning went to see a delighted Sun Quan, who told him: &quot;Were your actions enough to frighten the old man (Cao Cao)? I had the opportunity of witnessing your valour.&quot; Sun Quan then rewarded Gan Ning with 1,000 rolls of silk and 100 swords. He also remarked, &quot;Mengde (Cao Cao) has Zhang Liao while I have Xingba. I can match him.&quot; Cao Cao withdrew his armies from Ruxu after slightly more than a month. Gan Ning commanded even greater respect among Sun Quan&#x27;s forces and the number of troops under his command increased by 2,000.

== Death ==
When Gan Ning died, Sun Quan deeply lamented his death. No further details about Gan Ning&#x27;s death were provided in his biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;. However, the &quot;Jiankang Shilu&quot; recorded that Gan Ning died in the winter of 215–216, while the Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny estimated that Gan Ning died around 220.

==Family==
Gan Ning&#x27;s ancestor was Gan Mao (甘茂), a chancellor of the Qin state in the Warring States period.

Gan Ning&#x27;s son, Gan Gui (甘瓌), was exiled to Kuaiji Commandery (around present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang) for committing an offence and died not long later.

Gan Shu (甘述), another son of Gan Ning, served as a Master of Writing (尚書) in the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. Gan Shu&#x27;s son, Gan Chang (甘昌), served as the Crown Prince&#x27;s Tutor (太子太傅) in Wu. Gan Chang had a son – Gan Zhuo (甘卓), whose courtesy name was Jisi (季思). Gan Zhuo served as Senior General Who Guards the South (鎮南大將軍) and Governor of Jing Province (荊州牧) during the Jin dynasty.
==Appraisal==
Gan Ning was rough and violent; moreover he took pleasure in killing. However, he was also jovial, gregarious and capable of using strategy. He respected virtuous persons and had little regard for monetary wealth. He treated his men well and they were also willing to fight for him with their lives.

===Conflict with Ling Tong===
Ling Tong (Ling Cao&#x27;s son) never forgave Gan Ning for killing his father at the Battle of Xiakou in 203. Gan Ning was always on the defensive against Ling Tong and deliberately avoided meeting him. Sun Quan also ordered Ling Tong to not seek vengeance on Gan Ning. There was one incident during a banquet held in Lü Meng&#x27;s house, where both Gan Ning and Ling Tong were present. When Ling Tong was performing a sword dance to entertain the guests, Gan Ning stood up and said, &quot;I can also perform with my pair of &quot;ji&quot;s.&quot; Lü Meng told Gan Ning: &quot;You may be good in performing, but you&#x27;re not as good as me.&quot; He then drew his sword and carried a shield and stood between Ling Tong and Gan Ning to separate the two of them. When Sun Quan heard about the incident, he relocated Gan Ning to a garrison at Banzhou (半州).

===Dispute with Lü Meng===
One of Gan Ning&#x27;s servants committed an offence and was afraid of being punished so he sought shelter under Lü Meng. Lü Meng feared that Gan Ning would kill the servant so he did not send the servant away. Later, when Gan Ning visited Lü Meng&#x27;s house and brought along gifts for the latter&#x27;s mother, Lü brought the servant out to meet Gan, and Gan promised to spare the servant. However, Gan Ning reneged on his word later as he tied the servant to a tree and personally killed him by firing arrows at him. After that, he went back to his boat and ordered his men to lengthen the hawsers while he undressed and rested inside the cabin.

Lü Meng was furious when he heard that Gan Ning had killed the servant so he gathered his own men and prepared to confront Gan. Gan Ning continued resting when he heard Lü Meng approaching. Lü Meng&#x27;s mother came out of the house barefooted and chided her son: &quot;The lord (Sun Quan) treats you like his family and entrusts you with important responsibilities. How can you kill Gan Ning just because you have a private feud with him? If Gan Ning dies, even if the lord does not inquire into the incident, you have already overstepped your role as a subject.&quot; Lü Meng was a filial son so his anger subsided after listening to his mother. He then went to Gan Ning&#x27;s boat, laughed and said: &quot;Xingba, my mother is treating you to a meal. Come up quickly!&quot; Gan Ning wept and replied: &quot;I have let you down.&quot; He followed Lü Meng to meet his mother and they feasted for the whole day.

== In popular culture ==
=== In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; ===
Gan Ning appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. Some of the actual events in his life are exaggerated or dramatised in the novel.

The description of Gan Ning&#x27;s night raid on Cao Cao&#x27;s camp at the Battle of Ruxu in the novel is more vivid as compared to that mentioned in his biography. Before the raid, Ling Tong leads 3,000 troops to engage the enemy and duels with Zhang Liao before he receives orders to retreat. When Gan Ning sees that, he tells Sun Quan: &quot;Tonight I&#x27;ll bring only 100 men to raid Cao Cao&#x27;s camp. If I lose a single soldier, this won&#x27;t count as a contribution.&quot; That night, he leads 100 horsemen to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s camp and all of them return alive after inflicting heavy damage and casualties on the enemy.

Gan Ning kills Ling Tong&#x27;s father, Ling Cao, at the Battle of Xiakou in 203. Since then, even after Gan Ning comes to serve Sun Quan, Ling Tong still holds a grudge against him. Their conflict is dramatised in chapters 67–68 of the novel, and is eventually resolved after Gan Ning saves Ling Tong&#x27;s life.

Gan Ning&#x27;s death is described in Chapter 83. He is killed at the Battle of Xiaoting by the tribal king Shamoke, an ally of Liu Bei.

<doc id="276219" wikidata="Q176240" url="?curid=276219" title="Galaxie 500">
<text>Galaxie 500 was an American indie rock band that formed in 1987 and split up in 1991 after releasing three studio albums: &quot;Today&quot; (1988), &quot;On Fire&quot; (1989), and &quot;This Is Our Music&quot; (1990).

The band membership comprised guitarist and vocalist Dean Wareham, drummer Damon Krukowski, and bassist and vocalist Naomi Yang.

== History ==
=== Formation and early releases ===
Guitarist Dean Wareham, drummer Damon Krukowski and bassist Naomi Yang had met at the Dalton School in New York City in 1981, but began playing together during their time as students at Harvard University. Wareham and Krukowski had formed a series of punk-influenced student bands, before Wareham returned to New York. When he returned in 1987 he and Krukowski formed a new band, with Yang joining the group on bass guitar, the new group deciding on the name Galaxie 500, after a friend&#x27;s car, a Ford Galaxie 500.

The band began playing gigs in Boston and New York City, and recorded a demo which they sent to Shimmy Disc label boss and producer Mark Kramer, who agreed to produce the band. With Kramer at the controls, the band recorded the &quot;Tugboat&quot; single in February 1988, and the &quot;Oblivious&quot; flexi-disc, and moved on to record their debut album, &quot;Today&quot;, which was released on the small Aurora label. The band toured the United Kingdom in late 1988 and in 1989, then signed to Rough Trade and released their second album, &quot;On Fire&quot;, which has been described as &quot;lo-fi psychedelia reminiscent of Jonathan Richman being backed by The Velvet Underground&quot;, and is considered the band&#x27;s defining moment. &quot;On Fire&quot; reached number 7 in the UK Indie Chart, and met with much critical acclaim in the United Kingdom, but was less well received by the US music press, who cited Wareham&#x27;s &#x27;vocal limitations&#x27; as a weakness.

Galaxie 500 recorded two sessions for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 programme, these later released on the &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; album. Their cover of Jonathan Richman&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Our Youth Go To Waste&quot; was also voted into number 41 in 1989&#x27;s Festive 50 by listeners to the show.

=== Later releases and breakup ===
The band split up in the spring of 1991 after the release of their third album, &quot;This Is Our Music.&quot; Wareham, who had already moved back to New York, quit the band after a lengthy American tour, as preparations were underway for a tour of Japan. As Wareham later said, &quot;Galaxie 500 broke up because it was time. We broke up as a result of internal contradictions. Columbia Records was interested in signing us, but the making of the previous album had been very difficult--and clearly we weren&#x27;t getting along--so why should we continue to sit in a room and make music together?&quot; Their last performance was on April 5, 1991, at Bowdoin College for the campus radio station, WBOR.

Galaxie 500&#x27;s records were released in the US and UK on the independent Rough Trade label. When Rough Trade went bankrupt in 1991, Krukowski and Yang purchased the masters at auction, reissuing them on Rykodisc in 1996 as a box set containing all three albums and another disc of rarities.

=== Post-breakup activities ===
After leaving Galaxie 500, Wareham tried his hand at production, working with Mercury Rev. He released a solo single, &quot;Anesthesia,&quot; in February 1992, and formed a new band, Luna. Krukowski and Yang continued to record under the moniker Pierre Etoile (French for &quot;Rock Star&quot;), and then Damon &amp; Naomi (whose first two releases were also produced by Kramer), and as members of Magic Hour. They also began the avant-garde press Exact Change.

In June 2010 Wareham announced on his website that he would be going on an autumn tour under the moniker &quot;Dean Wareham plays Galaxie 500,&quot; where he would, as the moniker suggests, only play Galaxie 500 songs.

== Musical style and influences ==
Galaxie 500 was an indie rock band that used simple instrumental techniques that were enhanced through an atmospheric production style. The sound has been described as &quot;reverb-saturated, woozily slow-paced and minimal.&quot; Music critic Jim DeRogatis assessed, “Galaxy 500 never altered its trippy, somnambulistic formula, but what a splendid formula it was.” In his book &quot;Gimme Indie Rock&quot;, music journalist Andrew Earles described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;a usually slow to mid-tempo amalgam of the Velvet Underground, the Feelies, the U.K.&#x27;s proto-shoegaze/drone rock icons Spaceman 3, The Dream Syndicate, and Television gently pushed through a hazy dream-pop filter.&quot;

The Velvet Underground and Jonathan Richman have been identified as key influences. In interviews on the Galaxie 500 DVD &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Our Youth Go to Waste&quot;, Wareham cites Spacemen 3 as another key inspiration.

== Legacy ==
Jason Ankeny of AllMusic said Galaxy 500 was &quot;arguably as influential on indie rock as the Velvet Underground was on the rock and punk that came after it&quot; and that the band had a &quot;lasting effect on the shoegaze and slowcore movements that followed&quot;.

Galaxie 500&#x27;s music had an influence on many later indie music groups, including Low. Their music has been covered and referenced by several well known artists. In Liz Phair&#x27;s song &quot;Stratford-on-Guy&quot;, she sings, &quot;And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video.&quot; In Xiu Xiu&#x27;s song &quot;Dr. Troll&quot;, Jamie Stewart sings, &quot;Listen to &quot;On Fire&quot; and pretend someone could love you.&quot; On Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s debut album, &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, the song &quot;Naomi&quot; was written about Naomi Yang, and includes the line &quot;There is no Naomi in view/She walks through Cambridge stocks and strolls&quot;; in 2011, Yang created a music video for the song, including an anecdote recounting how Neutral Milk Hotel member Julian Koster gave her a copy of the album and told her the song was written about her. The Brian Jonestown Massacre&#x27;s &quot;And This Is Our Music&quot; was titled in reference to the group&#x27;s album &quot;This Is Our Music&quot; (which itself was titled after Ornette Coleman&#x27;s album &quot;This Is Our Music&quot;). Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore has cited Galaxie 500&#x27;s album &quot;Today&quot; as &quot;the guitar record of 1988&quot;.

&quot;Tugboat&quot; has been covered by many artists, including The Submarines, who recorded it with indie rock producer Adam Lasus for their &quot;iTunes Live Session EP&quot;, British Sea Power, on Rough Trade compilation &quot;Stop Me If You Think You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before...&quot;, Welsh lo-fi band Joanna Gruesome, and Portastatic, Kiwi Jr., for a planned concert of Galaxie 500 covers at Rough Trade Brooklyn set to coincide with Record Store Day and the release of Galaxie&#x27;s Copenhagen on vinyl. In 2010 the bands Cloudland Canyon and Citay, appeared on a 7-inch EP together wherein they both covered Galaxie 500, the former taking on &quot;Temperature&#x27;s Rising&quot; and the latter doing a version of &quot;Tugboat&quot;. English artist World Of Fox covered &quot;Flowers&quot; in his 2011 release on Where It&#x27;s At Is Where You Are Records.

In 2012 the song &quot;Tugboat&quot; was featured in the film &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;, directed by Stephen Chbosky and based on his book of the same name.

<text>Christina of Lorraine (, ) (16 August 1565 – 19 December 1637) was a noblewoman of the House of Lorraine who became a Grand Duchess of Tuscany by marriage. She served as Regent of Tuscany jointly with her daughter-in-law during the minority of her grandson from 1621 to 1628.

==Princess of Lorraine==
Born in Nancy, she was the daughter of Charles III of Lorraine and his wife Claude of Valois, and granddaughter of Catherine de&#x27; Medici. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Christina of Denmark.

==Grand Duchess of Tuscany==
In 1584, Mary, Queen of Scots, hoped that Christina would marry her son James VI of Scotland. Mary thought that Christina, as her family relation, would be a useful ally to her. Mary wrote to Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France, about this marriage plan, but nothing came of it.

In 1587 Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany died without a legitimate male heir; his brother Ferdinando immediately declared himself the third Grand Duke of Tuscany. Seeking a marriage that would preserve his political independence, Ferdinando chose his distant cousin, Christine of Lorraine, the favourite granddaughter of Catherine de&#x27; Medici. Catherine had influenced her towards this marriage, to re-align the Medici with France, not Spain.

The sumptuous and well-documented wedding festivities, celebrated in Florence in 1589, were designed to impress the royal houses of Europe. The wedding ceremony in Florence Cathedral was followed by outdoor events for the public, as well as banquets and balls, comedies and musical interludes, and a mock sea battle in the flooded courtyard of Palazzo Pitti for the aristocratic guests. PJ Mariette takes note of the various artists including Santi di Tito, Gregorio Pagani, Camillo Pagni, and Giovanni Battista Paggi, who worked on the ephemeral decorations. Altogether the wedding spectacles cost approximately fourteen million pounds in today&#x27;s currency. These lavish and innovative forms of entertainment proved to be more than showmanship. They greatly influenced theatrical practices in European courts throughout the 17th century.

On 28 July 1603 she wrote to Anne of Denmark to congratulate her and King James coming to the throne of England. The letter was brought to London by Count Alfonso Montecuccoli.

== Grand Duke Cosimo II ==
Christina&#x27;s husband died in early 1609, shortly after her son had wed. Grand Duke Cosimo II was only 19 when he assumed power, and Christina remained a dominant force at the court. In 1610 the Venetian ambassador Giacomo Vendramin wrote home: &quot;the grand duchess wants thus to govern everything absolutely, without any thought to the reputation and the benefit of her son&quot;. Christina was keen to bolster the dynastic claim of the Medici, and commissioned a biography of the first grand duke and her father-in-law Cosimo I. She also commissioned engravings by Jacques Callot to showcase the life of her late husband Ferdinando I.

== Co-Regency of Tuscany==
Her son Cosimo II died in February 1621, leaving his ten-year-old son Ferdinando II as grand duke. Christina and her daughter-in-law, Maria Maddalena of Austria, acted as regents until the boy came of age. Their regency is known as the &quot;Tutrici&quot;. Little is known about the relationship of the two women, though they coexisted at court. Maria Maddalena took on the public political role by taking the seat in the &quot;primo luogo&quot;. Christina took charge of engaging with the Florentine religious establishment. Maria Maddalena assumed the title of archduchess. Christina became known as the Dowager Grand Duchess, and sent Ferdinando II on a tour of Europe in 1627. Maria Maddalena died in November 1631, shortly after her son Ferdinando II had formally assumed the position of grand duke.

Maria Maddalena&#x27; brother was the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and she supported his anti-Protestant politics. Together with her brother she supported the militant wing of the Jesuits, with their Counter-Reformation ideology. Contemporary sources did not pass judgement on the quality of the co-regency, but focused on detailing the daily going-on at court. The 18th Century historian Jacopo Riguccio Galluzzi remarked on the co-regency &quot;everything started to decline from the moment of Cosimo II&#x27; death&quot;. Galluzzi criticised that in the co-regency religious men were allowed to enter administrative ranks in the Tuscan government. Galluzzi also lamented that both women continued to influence Ferdinando II after he had come of age. Angelo Solerti, an important source on the Florentine court lamented that &quot;the Jesuits acted as if they were in charge&quot;. The co-regents did abolish a century old law in 1623 to allow patricians to participate in the government of Florence. As a consequence patricians started to occupy positions in a range of institutions of the Medici government and in the civil service. This move was intended to weaken the power of the Roman aristocrats in Florentine government. This strategy was continued by Ferdinando II.

Christina of Lorraine died at the Medici villa in Castello, aged 72, in December 1636.

==Patronage==
===Science===
Christina was chosen by Fernando as bride, not only because she was a devout Catholic, but also because she was intelligent and well educated. Christina had received a scholarly education due to the efforts of Catherine de&#x27; Medici. In 1605, she invited Galileo Galilei to tutor her son Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici. Among other things, Galilei taught Cosimo the use of the geometric and military compass. In 1608 Christina asked Galileo to attend Cosimo&#x27;s wedding to Maria Maddalena of Austria and in the same year asked him to cast a horoscope for her ill husband. Following the death of his father, Cosimo assumed the throne in February 1609, and Galileo applied for patronage at the Medici court.

Christina and the Medici Court also offered patronage to the philosopher Cosimo Boscaglia. When the court was in Pisa during winter, in December 1613, Galileo&#x27;s former student Benedetto Castelli was invited to court. At a breakfast attended by Cosimo II, his wife, his mother Christina and Boscaglia the Medicean stars were discussed. These were the four moons of Jupiter Galileo had discovered and named after Cosimo II and his brothers. Boscaglia conceded that these moons were real, and not an illusion produced by the lens of the telescope. But Boscaglia argued that Galileo&#x27;s interpretation of his discoveries was wrong, mainly because &quot;the motion of the Earth seemed incredible and could not be true, all the more so since Holy Scripture was clearly against this opinion.&quot; Christina asked Castelli for his opinion on the matter, not as a mathematician but as a theologian. Castelli responded that with regards to the exact workings of nature, he gave precedence to natural philosophers, and that theologians should in the light of these findings determine the meaning of the Bible. In the letter to Galileo, Castelli stated that Christina criticized heliocentrism, and Galileo did not like this. However, Christina&#x27;s disagreement was prompted by Boscaglia rather than by her own thought.

Galileo had been attacked in front of his paymasters, and after being warned by Castelli and an exchange of views with his former student, he drafted a response. In his &quot;Letter to Grand Duchess Christina&quot; Galileo expounded on the relationship between science and revelation. He argued that the Scripture does not intend to teach natural philosophy, but conveys the message of salvation. Thus there was not need to reconcile the Bible with science, and that it would damage the authority of the Church in the unbelieving world if it was to make rash pronouncements about science. This line of argument resembled Christina&#x27;s own views on the matter, and is in essence the position the Catholic Church takes today on questions of science.

=== Female monasteries ===
Christina&#x27;s reputation for piety stems from her patronage for Florentine religious institutions, particularly female monasteries. She became an active patron immediately after her marriage. In 1592 she and her daughters were granted permission by Pope Clement VIII to enter Florentine convents during the day. Through her patronage the Monastero di Santa Croce (or &quot;La Crocetta&quot;) became the principal residence for unmarried Medici princesses. As a young women Christina had expressed the wish to finish her life in a convent, but she never withdrew from political affairs. Though she did build for herself a residence next to Crocetta, and spend less time at the Medici court in Pitti Palace. In 1627 she purchased a villa, renamed it &quot;La Quiete&quot; and had it decorated in iconographic style by Giovanni da San Giovanni.

He is best known for his work with Christopher Guest in his mockumentary films &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984), &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; (1996), &quot;Best in Show&quot; (2000), &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; (2006), and &quot;Mascots&quot; (2016). He also appeared in supporting roles in the comedy films &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999), &quot;American Wedding&quot; (2003), and &quot;&quot; (2004). On television, Willard received several Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his work on the sitcoms &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; and &quot;Modern Family&quot;.

==Early life==
Frederick Charles Willard was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 18, 1933. Willard&#x27;s mother, Ruth (née Weinman) was a housewife. Willard was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. In 1945, when Fred was 12 years old, his father, Frederick Charles Willard, died. 

Willard graduated from the Kentucky Military Institute in 1951 and the Virginia Military Institute in 1955. He was stationed in Germany while serving in the United States Army.

==Career==
===Early career===

Willard&#x27;s stage career began when he moved to New York in the late 1950s. His initial work included a production of &quot;Desperate Hours&quot; at a local YMCA where he worked with future comedy partner Vic Grecco. They later performed as Willard &amp; Grecco in the Greenwich Village area, found some success touring, and appeared on &quot;The Dean Martin Show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. They were offered roles in the television series &quot;Get Smart&quot; and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, but the offers fell through due to poor management. The two parted ways in 1968.

Willard&#x27;s film debut was in the 1967 exploitation film &quot;Teenage Mother&quot;. He later reported that the audience at one screening booed when his character interrupted an attempted sexual assault of the female lead.

One of Willard&#x27;s earliest performing jobs was at The Second City, Chicago, where he shared the stage with Robert Klein and David Steinberg. He was a founding member of the improvisational comedy group Ace Trucking Company, whose other members included Michael Mislove and Bill Saluga. They performed sketches on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; over 50 times, and appeared regularly on &quot;This is Tom Jones&quot;.

===Rise to prominence===
Willard achieved wider fame in 1977–78 as Barth Gimble&#x27;s (Martin Mull) sidekick and announcer Jerry Hubbard on the &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; spinoffs &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot;, &quot;Forever Fernwood&quot; and &quot;America 2-Night&quot;, which parodied the nighttime talk shows of the day. He was an original cast member of the NBC series &quot;Real People&quot; in 1979, then again from 1981 to 1983. He played Tom Osbourne in the 1987 Academy Award–winning short film &quot;Ray&#x27;s Male Heterosexual Dance Hall&quot;. From 1987 to 1989 he starred as a bartender/straightman in Sid and Marty Krofft&#x27;s &quot;D.C. Follies&quot;, and was host to the Krofft puppets portraying political figures of the time.

Willard hosted the talk show &quot;What&#x27;s Hot, What&#x27;s Not,&quot; which aired from 1985 to 1986 and earned him a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Talk Show Host.

In 1990, Willard hosted the cable TV show &quot;Access America&quot; on the Ha! Comedy Network. As part of that show, on September 21, 1990, he appeared in episode 7 of the cult public-access television show &quot;Decoupage&quot; with Summer Caprice.

In 1995, Willard reunited with his &quot;Fernwood&quot; co-star, Martin Mull, playing Scott, the romantic partner of Mull&#x27;s character Leon Carp, on &quot;Roseanne&quot;. The couple married in the episode &quot;December Bride&quot;, and Scott became a recurring character during the series&#x27; final two seasons. 

That same year, Willard guest-starred in three episodes of &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, starring Tia and Tamera Mowry; Willard played Carl Mitushka, a teacher at Roosevelt High who often spoke popular teenage slang terms in order to sound cool to his students. Willard voiced travel agent Wally Kogen in the 1999 episode &quot;Sunday, Cruddy Sunday&quot; for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

From 2001 to 2002, he played the father of five children on &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Me&quot;, and also guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;. In 1985, he and Mull joined up again for the mockumentary &quot;The History of White People in America&quot;. He played Mayor Deebs in &quot;Roxanne&quot;, starring Steve Martin.

===Sustained success===
Willard appeared in several Christopher Guest films, such as &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;, in which he played Mike LaFontaine (known for his catchphrase &quot;Eh—whahappen&#x27;?&quot;); &quot;Best in Show&quot;, where he played Buck Laughlin, a dog show announcer with an unending stream of bad jokes and off-color comments; &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, playing Ron Albertson, a travel agent who performs in amateur stage productions with his wife; &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, where he played a lieutenant on the military base where Spinal Tap perform; and &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; as an obnoxious entertainment television show anchor. For his performance in &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, Willard received an American Comedy Award nomination and a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Funniest Supporting Actor. He received the Boston Film Critics Award, an American Comedy Award, a Sierra Award and a tribute from AFI for his portrayal of Buck Laughlin in &quot;Best in Show&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;American Wedding&quot;, and as KVWN news director Ed Harken in &quot;&quot;.

Willard had a recurring role as Hank MacDougall on the later seasons of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, which brought him Emmy Award nominations in 2003, 2004, and 2005. He also hosted a VH1 documentary series, &quot;Totally Obsessed&quot;, about people obsessed with their hobbies. He appeared as Captain Ribmanman in Episode 21 of &quot;Channel Frederator&quot;, a podcast from Kansas.

On &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Willard appeared in 100 sketches as a government official, businessman, or other authority figure who was always drinking. In 2006, he voiced Dad in the Academy Award nominated animated film &quot;Monster House&quot;. He also hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1978 (with musical guests Devo), and appeared twice on &quot;MADtv&quot;.

He was the voice of a clueless companion to a lazy robot (played by Martin Mull) in one episode of the series &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and guest-starred on the Adult Swim cartoon &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;. He acted in the Cartoon Network movie &quot;Re-Animated&quot; and played Vala Mal Doran&#x27;s &quot;father&quot; in an episode of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in 2007. He appeared in two episodes of the Adult Swim program &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;. He also starred as the &quot;Boogey Man&quot; in an episode of &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; and reprised his role in a 2006 video game and the movie &quot;Billy &amp; Mandy&#x27;s Big Boogey Adventure&quot;. His final appearance as &quot;Boogey&quot; occurred in &quot;Billy &amp; Mandy: Wrath of the Spider Queen&quot;. In 2007, he made a guest appearance on the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Come on Over&quot;.

He played Shelby Forthright, the CEO of the Buy &#x27;n&#x27; Large Corporation, in the first ever live-action speaking segments by Pixar in the animated film &quot;WALL-E&quot;. 

Willard completed a sold-out run of &quot;Fred Willard: Alone At Last!&quot;, advertised as a &quot;one-man show&quot; but actually featuring a cast of twelve, and received Los Angeles Artistic Director Awards for Best Comedy and Best Production. Willard had several stage roles to his credit, including Off-Broadway performances in &quot;Little Murders&quot;, directed by Alan Arkin, and &quot;Arf&quot;, directed by Richard Benjamin. His regional roles include &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; in Chicago and the musicals &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, with Jason Alexander, and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; with Rachel York, both in Los Angeles. He starred in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic&quot; and off Broadway in &quot;Elvis and Juliet&quot;.

On October 5, 2008, he hosted the Nickelodeon Fido Awards.

Willard played Frank Dunphy, father of Phil (Ty Burrell), in several episodes of the ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot;. For his performance, he was nominated at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series and in the same category at the 72nd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, a posthumous nomination. 
On September 16, 2011, Willard was honored as a &quot;Pioneer in Comedy&quot; at Burbank International Film Festival. Also in 2011, Willard starred as &quot;Santa Jack,&quot; a comical—and somewhat pervy—owner of a local Christmas carnival in episode 12 of the final season of &quot;The Closer&quot;.

In 2012, he played Al Kaiser in Rob Reiner&#x27;s film &quot;The Magic of Belle Isle&quot;. In 2013, he starred in &quot;The Bird Men&quot; (originally called &quot;The Birder&quot;) alongside Tom Cavanagh, a film centered around a mild-mannered birder who seeks revenge on a younger rival, after losing the highly coveted Head of Ornithology position at the National Park.

Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters presented Willard with the Art Gilmore Career Achievement Award at their celebrity luncheon on June 19, 2015.

On August 10, 2018, Willard made a special guest appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, reprising his role from a 1970s television pilot for an unmade series called &quot;Space Force&quot;, in light of President Donald Trump&#x27;s announcement that he will create a space force for the United States military. Following the sketch, Willard made guest appearances on the show on a frequent basis, often portraying comedic, misguided characters parodying current news topics which Jimmy would interview &quot;live via satellite&quot;. The characters included the ghosts of Fred Trump and George Washington, a Trump-supporting Santa Claus, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

On October 23, 2019, it was announced that Willard was cast as Fred Naird in the 2020 Netflix comedy series, &quot;Space Force&quot;. This was Willard&#x27;s final acting role, with the series being released two weeks after his death.

Willard&#x27;s final voice-acting performance was in the 2017 Disney animated cartoon &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot; as the character Mr. Doozy. 

Willard&#x27;s final role was in the 2021 television film &quot;Captain Daddy&quot;, where he played the role of Daddy, it was released in the summer a year after his death.

==Personal life and death==

===Marriage and family===
In 1968, Willard married Mary Lovell (1947–2018). They had a daughter and a grandson.

===Legal issues===
On July 18, 2012, Willard was arrested on suspicion of engaging in masturbation at an adult theater on Santa Monica Boulevard and was brought to the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Hollywood Station. However, there was no proof of any misconduct and no charges were filed. Despite the outcomes, PBS fired Willard from &quot;Market Warriors&quot; immediately following his arrest, and Mark L. Walberg replaced him on the show. In an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; shortly thereafter, Willard stated that the incident was &quot;very painful&quot; and &quot;very embarrassing&quot;, but that he &quot;did nothing wrong&quot;. Willard was subsequently required to take a sex education diversion program.

===Death===
Willard died at his home in Los Angeles on May 15, 2020, at age 86, according to his daughter and his representative. His cause of death was reported as cardiac arrest, with coronary artery disease and myelodysplastic syndrome as contributing factors. Jamie Lee Curtis and her husband Christopher Guest, who frequently worked with Willard, were the first to reveal the news of his death. Willard is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

<text>The olive warbler (Peucedramus taeniatus) is a small passerine bird. It is the only member of the genus Peucedramus and the family Peucedramidae.

This species breeds from southern Arizona and New Mexico, USA, south through Mexico to Nicaragua. It is the only bird family endemic to North America (including Central America). It was in the past classed with the Parulidae (New World warblers), but DNA studies suggest that it split early from the other related passerines, prior to the differentiation of the entire New World warbler/American sparrow/Icterid group. It is therefore now given a family of its own.

It is an insectivorous species of coniferous forests. Though it is often said to be non-migratory, most New Mexican birds leave the state from November to late February. It lays 3–4 eggs in a tree nest.

==Taxonomy==
The olive warbler was originally placed in the New World warbler (family Parulidae) genus &quot;Dendroica&quot;, a group which it closely resembles, particularly in having nine primaries and similar skin. In spite of being assigned to its own genus in 1875, its affinities were a source of contention. The shape of the basihyal bone in the skull, and aspects of its behaviour led to the suggestion that it was instead an Old World warbler in the family Sylviidae. That it was not in the family Parulidae was supported by the arrangement of muscles in the legs. DNA–DNA hybridization placed the olive warbler as an early branch of the finch clade (which included the finches, cardinals and Hawaiian honeycreepers) and the New World sparrow clade (which includes the tanagers, icterids and New World warblers), and a 1998 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed its status as being far removed from the New World warblers.

The generic name of the olive warbler, &quot;Peucedramus&quot;, is derived from the Greek &quot;peuke&quot; for a fir tree and &quot;dromos&quot; for runner, (from &quot;trekho&quot;, meaning run), a reference to its feeding habitat and behaviour. The species name, &quot;taeniatus&quot;, is from the Latin &quot;taenia&quot; for a headband, and &quot;atus&quot; for possessing, a reference to its facial markings. The original specific name for the species was &quot;olivaceus&quot;; however that name was preoccupied and the name was changed.

==Description==
The olive warbler is a medium-sized warbler, in length and weighing . It shows clinal variation in size, with more northern populations being larger than southern ones, a phenomenon known as Bergmann&#x27;s rule. The olive warbler is a long-winged bird. The plumage of the male is mostly grey body with some olive-green on the wings and two white wing bars. The male&#x27;s head and breast are &quot;tawny-orange&quot;, and there is a black patch through the eye. In the female and juvenile, the orange is replaced by yellow, and the black mask is more diffuse. In addition to differences in size, plumage varies geographically as well, with southern birds having more brightly coloured plumage.

The song consists of clear whistles rendered as &quot;hirrJI hirrJI hirrJI&quot;, &quot;plida plida plida chir chir&quot;, etc. The male sings throughout the year, with the frequency of the singing increasing in late winter and reaching a peak in early spring. During the year the male sings the most during the midmorning, but during spring the male sings constantly during mornings and late afternoon. Song is usually delivered from the canopy or other tall trees.

==Distribution and habitat==

The olive warbler is distributed from the southwestern United States to Nicaragua, making it the only bird family endemic to North America. In the northern part of its range it has a continuous distribution from Yavapai County, Arizona and the southwestern tip of New Mexico along central Mexico to southern Mexico. It has a disjunct distribution across the rest of its range, with populations in Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico, and further south in southwest Guatemala and from northern El Salvador and central Honduras to northern Nicaragua.

The olive warbler is a bird of mountains and highlands. In northern areas of its range it occurs from above sea level or more, in some parts of its range it may not occur below . In Oaxaca in Mexico it occupies a range of between further south in Guatemala it ranges down to and at the southern end of its range it can be found as low as in Honduras and in Nicaragua it occupies a belt of forest from . They typically inhabit conifer forests, such as ponderosa and sugar pine forests in Arizona, &quot;Abies&quot; common fir forests, oak, and pine forests in central Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. These forests range from humid to semi-arid. In coastal regions stands of palms may be used, and in the Valley of Mexico pine and alder forests are inhabited.

Over most of its range the species is , but there is evidence that the most northerly populations are partial migrants. Birds in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico apparently move away from their breeding grounds, although what exact movements are made is unclear. It has been suggested that they are either &quot;down slope migrants&quot;, moving to lower elevations, or dispersive, as some records show their presence in Texas. Birds attributed to the northern race &quot;P. t. arizonae&quot; have been recorded near Tepic, in Nayarit. Nevertheless, some birds remain in the northern areas of their range year round.

==Diet and feeding==
The olive warbler is an insectivore, taking insects and other arthropods. No specific information exists about the actual prey species taken, except that they will take the larvae of Tortricidae moths. It forages in forests in the canopy and subcanopy. In feeds in the outer branches and twigs. It mostly feeds in the branches of ponderosa pines, but also feeds in the branches of grey and silverleaf oaks.

<text>The Mesopotamian Half-Flight (MHF), or Australian Half-Flight, was the first Australian Flying Corps (AFC) unit to see active service during World War I. Formed in April 1915 at the request of the Indian Government, the half-flight&#x27;s personnel were sent to Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) where they were equipped with a small number of outdated and barely serviceable aircraft. They later operated in the Tigris Valley in support of British and Indian forces under the command of Major General Charles Townshend. The unit&#x27;s operations came to an end in December 1915 and the following month the flight was subsumed into other units of the AFC which were being formed in Egypt. It was officially disbanded in October 1916.

==History==
At the start of World War I, the air forces of the Allied forces were small and primitive. Most of the available aircraft and pilots were assigned to the Western Front. This meant that the Indian Army, which was attacking the Ottoman Empire in Mesopotamia, had no air support. On 8 February 1915, the Australian government received a request for air assistance from the British Government of India. The AFC was still in its infancy and could provide enough aircrews and ground staff for only half a flight: the unit therefore became known as the Mesopotamian Half-Flight, or Australian Half-Flight and Captain Henry Petre was appointed commander.

The Mesopotamian Half-Flight was formed at the Central Flying School on 1 April 1915. Upon establishment, the unit consisted of four officers and 41 enlisted personnel. The personnel assigned to the Half-Flight included four of the seven trained pilots in Australia at the time. The Australians were to be augmented by personnel from the Indian Army and New Zealand. The AFC contingent sailed for Bombay, and on 20 April it left for Basra.

The half-flight&#x27;s aircraft were to be provided by the Indian Government, and on its arrival in Basra on 26 May, two Maurice Farman Shorthorns and a Maurice Farman Longhorn were handed over. These three biplanes were of a &quot;pusher&quot; design, so-called because the propeller was placed aft of the engine, behind the cockpit. The planes were already obsolete and were not suitable for the desert conditions. To start with, their top speed was only 50 mph (80 km/h), while the desert wind (known as the &quot;shamal&quot;) often reached 80 mph (129 km/h). Secondly, the warm desert air reduced the aircraft lift capability, rendering them unable to take off on occasions. The Longhorn was a second-hand aircraft and had persistent mechanical problems, meaning that it spent much time being repaired.

After arrival, the aircraft were immediately put to use on reconnaissance missions, operating in the Tigris Valley in support of British and Indian forces under the command of Major General Charles Townshend. Shortly afterwards, the Indian Army captured the town of Amarah, and after arriving there in early June, the half-flight began operations in support of an advance towards Kut from Amarah, with intervening operations in Nasiriyeh. On 4 July, the half-flight&#x27;s equipment was augmented with two Caudron G.3 aircraft, which were still not up-to-date, but generally preferred to the Farmans. On 30 July, one of the Caudrons was forced to land in enemy territory due to mechanical problems. It was later reported that the crew – Lieutenants George Pinnock Merz (a medical doctor and formerly of the Melbourne University Rifles) and William Burn (a New Zealander) – were killed by armed Arab civilians after a running gun-battle over several miles. They were Australia&#x27;s first air-war casualties. In August the half-flight received four Martinsyde S.1s. On 24 August, it was officially attached to No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps, although the rest of 30 Squadron remained in Egypt for several weeks. The half-flight&#x27;s personnel and aircraft were incorporated into &quot;B&quot; Flight, No. 30 Squadron.

During September, three Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) Short 827 floatplanes and their crews, under Squadron Commander Robert Gordon, arrived and were attached to the half-flight. Because the Tigris river was too shallow for the seaplanes to use at that time of year, they were converted into Shorthorns. On 27 September, Kut was captured and the half-flight moved there. Four B.E.2c aircraft and their RFC crews arrived from Egypt in late October.

The Australian personnel of &quot;B&quot; Flight suffered an increasing number of losses with at least two crews being taken prisoner, either after being shot down or suffering engine failure. The Indian Army soon met with stiff opposition outside Baghdad, and were forced back to Kut on 4 December, where the city was besieged. After five months of siege, the garrison at Kut surrendered. Nine Australian ground staff became prisoners of war. Like the rest of the Allied prisoners, AFC personnel taken prisoner in Mesopotamia endured a punishing forced march of 700 miles (1100 km) to the Afion Kara Hissar POW camp in Anatolia in Turkey proper, and only two of them survived captivity (Thomas White and Francis Yeats-Brown). Petre, the last remaining Australian airman in Mesopotamia, left No. 30 Squadron and flew the only remaining Shorthorn to Egypt on 7 December, where he and it were eventually incorporated into the Australian Flying Corps squadrons that were forming there.

The Mesopotamian Half Flight was officially disbanded in October 1916. A total of nine pilots flew with the unit, and of them two were lost, presumed killed, and six were captured. Historian Alan Stephens has written that &quot;overshadowed by the Australian public’s interest in the contemporary events at Gallipoli, the Half Flight’s heroic and pioneering achievements went largely unrecognised&quot;.

<text>Petrified Forest National Park is a national park of the United States in Navajo and Apache counties in northeastern Arizona. Named for its large deposits of petrified wood, the park covers about , encompassing semi-desert shrub steppe as well as highly eroded and colorful badlands. The park&#x27;s headquarters is about east of Holbrook along Interstate 40 (I-40), which parallels the BNSF Railway&#x27;s Southern Transcon, the Puerco River, and historic U.S. Route 66, all crossing the park roughly east–west. The site, the northern part of which extends into the Painted Desert, was declared a national monument in 1906 and a national park in 1962. The park received 644,922 recreational visitors in 2018.

Averaging about in elevation, the park has a dry windy climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about to winter lows well below freezing. More than 400 species of plants, dominated by grasses such as bunchgrass, blue grama, and sacaton, are found in the park. Fauna include larger animals such as pronghorns, coyotes, and bobcats; many smaller animals, such as deer mice, snakes, lizards, and seven kinds of amphibians; and more than 200 species of birds, some of which are permanent residents and many of which are migratory. About one third of the park is designated wilderness—.

The Petrified Forest is known for its fossils, especially fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic Epoch, about 225 million years ago. The sediments containing the fossil logs are part of the widespread and colorful Chinle Formation, from which the Painted Desert gets its name. Beginning about 60 million years ago, the Colorado Plateau, of which the park is part, was pushed upward by tectonic forces and exposed to increased erosion. All of the park&#x27;s rock layers above the Chinle, except geologically recent ones found in parts of the park, have been removed by wind and water. In addition to petrified logs, fossils found in the park have included Late Triassic ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and many other plants as well as fauna including giant reptiles called phytosaurs, large amphibians, and early dinosaurs. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the park&#x27;s fossils since the early 20th century.

The park&#x27;s earliest human inhabitants arrived 13,000 years ago. These Clovis-era people are the ancestors of Native Americans. By about 2,500 years ago Ancestral Pueblo farmers were growing corn and living in subterranean pit houses in what would become the park. By one-thousand years ago Ancestral Pueblo farmers lived in above-ground, masonry dwellings called pueblos and gathered in large communal buildings called great kivas. By 1450 CE Ancestral Pueblo farmers in the Petrified Forest migrated to join rapidly growing communities on the Hopi Mesas to the northwest and the Pueblo of Zuni to the east–these locations are still home to thousands of descendant community members today. More than 1,000 archeological sites, including petroglyphs, have been discovered in the park. These ancestral places remain important to descendant communities. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers visited the area, and by the mid-19th century a U.S. team had surveyed an east–west route through the area where the park is now located and noted the petrified wood. Later, roads and a railway followed similar routes and gave rise to tourism and, before the park was protected, to large-scale removal of fossils. Theft of petrified wood remains a problem in the 21st century.

== Geography ==
Petrified Forest National Park straddles the border between Apache County and Navajo County in northeastern Arizona. The park is about long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about in the north to a minimum of about along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about .

I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.

The fee area of the park owned by NPS covers about . The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park&#x27;s elevation above sea level varies from a low of along the Puerco River to a high of at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about . The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north. Most of the park&#x27;s intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River. In the southern part of the park, Cottonwood Wash and Jim Camp Wash flow into the Little Colorado River.

== Geology ==
Petrified Forest National Park is known for its fossils, especially of fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic Epoch of the Mesozoic era, about 225–207 million years ago. During this epoch, the region that is now the park was near the equator on the southwestern edge of the supercontinent Pangaea, and its climate was humid and sub-tropical. What later became northeastern Arizona was a low plain flanked by mountains to the south and southeast and a sea to the west. Streams flowing across the plain from the highlands deposited inorganic sediment and organic matter, including trees as well as other plants and animals that had entered or fallen into the water. Although most organic matter decays rapidly or is eaten by other organisms, some is buried so quickly that it remains intact and may become fossilized. Within the park, the sediments containing the fossil logs for which the park is named are part of the Chinle Formation.

The colorful Chinle, which appears on the surface in many parts of the southwestern United States and from which the Painted Desert gets its name, is up to thick in the park. It consists of a variety of sedimentary rocks including beds of soft, fine-grained mudstone, siltstone, and claystone—much of which is bentonite—as well as harder sandstone and conglomerate, and limestone. Exposed to wind and water, the Chinle usually erodes differentially into badlands made up of cliffs, gullies, mesas, buttes, and rounded hills. Its bentonite clay, which swells when wet and shrinks while drying, causes surface movement and cracking that discourages plant growth. Lack of plant cover makes the Chinle especially susceptible to weathering.

About 60 million years ago, tectonic movements of the Earth&#x27;s crust began to uplift the Colorado Plateau, of which the Painted Desert is part. Eventually parts of the plateau rose to above sea level. This warping of the Earth&#x27;s surface led to the gradual and continuing destruction of the plateau by erosion. An unconformity (break in the rock record) of about 200 million years occurs within the park, where erosion has removed all the rock layers above the Chinle except geologically recent ones. The Bidahochi Formation, laid down only 4 to 8 million years ago, rests directly atop the Chinle, and rocks laid down in the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and much of the Tertiary are absent.

During the period of the Bidahochi deposition, a large lake basin covered much of northeastern Arizona. The older (lower) layers of the formation consist of fluvial and lacustrine (lake-related) deposits of silt, sand, and clay. The younger (upper) Bidahochi contains ash and lava from volcanoes that erupted nearby and as far away as southwestern Nevada. Although much of the Bidahochi has since eroded, a small part of it outcrops in the northern part of the park—on Pilot Rock in the park&#x27;s wilderness section and along the rim of the Painted Desert between Pintado and Tawa points. Exposed by erosion of the Bidahochi are volcanic landforms called maars (flat-bottomed, roughly circular volcanic craters of explosive origin). A maar vent can be seen from the Pintado Point lookout.

During the Quaternary Period (2.6 million years ago up to today), deposits of windblown sand and alluvium covered much of the Chinle and Bidahochi. Older dunes range in age from 500,000 years at higher elevations in the northern part of the park to about 10,000 years in sandy drainage areas such as Lithodendron Wash. Stabilized by grasses and other vegetation, young dunes of about 1,000 years old are found throughout the park.

=== Fossils ===

During the Late Triassic, downed trees accumulating in river channels in what became the park were buried periodically by sediment containing volcanic ash. Groundwater dissolved silica (silicon dioxide) from the ash and carried it into the logs, where it formed quartz crystals that gradually replaced the organic matter. Traces of iron oxide and other substances combined with the silica to create varied colors in the petrified wood.
In Petrified Forest National Park, most of the logs in the park retained their original external form during petrification but lost their internal structure. However, a small fraction of the logs and most of the park&#x27;s petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral-filled but still retain much of their original organic structure. With these permineralized fossils, it is possible to study the cellular make-up of the original organisms with the aid of a microscope. Other organic matter—typically leaves, seeds, pine-cones, pollen grains, spores, small stems, and fish, insect, and animal remains—have been preserved in the park as compression fossils, flattened by the weight of the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock.
Much of the park&#x27;s petrified wood is from &quot;Araucarioxylon arizonicum&quot;, an extinct conifer tree, while some found in the northern part of the park is from &quot;Woodworthia arizonica&quot; and &quot;Schilderia adamanica&quot; trees. At least nine species of fossil trees from the park have been identified; all are extinct. The park has many other kinds of fossils besides trees. The Chinle, considered to be one of the richest Late Triassic fossil-plant deposits in the world, contains more than 200 fossil plant taxa. Plant groups represented in the park include lycophytes, ferns, cycads, conifers, ginkgoes, as well as unclassified forms. The park has also produced one of the most diverse assemblages of fossil vertebrates from the Late Triassic. Among the groups represented are early theropod dinosaurs, crocodile-line archosaurs, temnospondyl amphibians, lissamphibians, non-archosauromorph diapsids, and other dinosauromorphs and archosauromorphs. Dicynodonts are extremely rare despite being abundantly represented at the &quot;Placerias&quot; Quarry near St. Johns. Fossil invertebrates include freshwater snails and clams. The oldest fossil crayfish, &quot;Enoploclytia porteri&quot;, was also described from the park, although it is not considered a crayfish proper (instead placed in Erymidae).

New animal species that were first identified from localities within the current park boundaries, some of which remain known only from the park, are listed below.
==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Petrified Forest National Park has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the plant hardiness zone at the Painted Desert Visitor Center is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of .

Winter winds can reach . Summer breezes are lighter, but the average wind causes frequent sandstorms and dust devils, some of which reach altitudes of several thousand feet.

Rain is heaviest from July through September, when 42 percent of the park&#x27;s annual average precipitation falls. August is the wettest month. At an elevation of more than , Petrified Forest National Park has a chance of light snow from October through March, although snow cover rarely persists. The annual average relative humidity of the area is below 50 percent and at times less than 15 percent.

== History ==

===Pre-United States===
More than 1,200 archeological sites have been found inside the boundaries of Petrified Forest National Park. Evidence suggests that the earliest inhabitants of the park arrived over 12,000 years ago. Clovis and Folsom-type spear points made from petrified wood are among the earliest artifacts of Paleoindians found in the park. Between , the Archaic Period, nomadic groups established seasonal camps in the Petrified Forest from which they hunted game such as rabbits, pronghorn antelope, and deer and harvested seeds from Indian ricegrass and other wild plants. By at least and through the Basketmaker II period (–)Ancestral Puebloan farmers began to grow corn. Between population size grew rapidly. Many families built houses in the Petrified Forest and for the first time began to stay there year-round.

During the Basketmaker III period, , families occupied shallow subterranean pit structures, at first on mesas or other vantage points and later at the base of bluffs and in lowlands, where the soil was better. Settlement patterns shifted and population size grew during the Pueblo I era between 700 and 900 CE and for the first time large groups of families aggregated together and formed large villages. During this period, each household built large well-insulated subterranean residential pit structures to keep warm during the cold winter months and several adjacent above ground rooms made from stone and jacal similar to adobe—used for food storage and daily activities during the warmer months. During the early Pueblo II period () Ancestral Pueblo farmers began constructing above-ground masonry architecture (for example Agate House, a small masonry structure built from petrified wood that is open to the public) signaling a greater degree of residential permanence. During the Late Pueblo II and Early Pueblo III periods 1050–1225 local population size grew rapidly. Similar to much of the Ancestral Pueblo world, population density increased rapidly at this time and nearly 1,000 sites dating to this period have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations—at the mouths of washes, near seeps, and on moisture-holding sand dunes.

Between 1250 and 1450 CE Ancestral Pueblo families gathered into large apartment building-like masonry structures (also known as pueblos) with several hundred people living together in close quarters. These large villages were often located near important water sources. Ancestral Pueblo people constructed more than two of these large pueblos, one called Stone Axe, about east of the park, and the other at Puerco Pueblo, which overlooks the Puerco River near the middle of the park. There they built roughly 200 rooms around an open plaza. Some rooms had no windows or doors and could be entered by climbing a ladder and descending through a hole in the roof. At its peak, perhaps 200 people lived in this pueblo. Over time, however, Ancestral Pueblo families undertook migrations and joined rapidly growing towns on the Hopi Mesas in Northern Arizona and at the Pueblo of Zuni in northern New Mexico, where the descendants of the ancient Petrified Forest farmers still live today. Some researchers have argued that a persistently dry climate led to out-migration, and the last residents left Puerco Pueblo in about 1380 CE.

At Puerco Pueblo and many other sites within the park, petroglyphs—images, symbols, or designs—have been scratched, pecked, carved, or incised on rock surfaces, often on a patina known as desert varnish. Most of the petroglyphs in Petrified Forest National Park are thought to be between 650 and 2,000 years old.

From the 16th through the 18th centuries, explorers looking for routes between Spanish colonies along the Rio Grande to the southeast and other Spanish colonies on the Pacific coast to the west passed near or through the area, which they called &quot;El Desierto Pintado&quot;, the Painted Desert. However, the park&#x27;s oldest Spanish inscriptions, left by descendants of the region&#x27;s early Spanish colonists, date only to the late 19th century.

===United States===
After the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good east–west routes along the 35th parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.

A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.

Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate 40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.

Increasing tourist and commercial interest in petrified wood during the late 19th century began to alarm residents of the region. In 1895, the Arizona Territorial Legislature asked the U.S. Congress to create a petrified forest national park. Although this first attempt failed, in 1906 the Antiquities Act signed by President Theodore Roosevelt was used to create the Petrified Forest National Monument as the second national monument. Between 1934 and 1942, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps built road, trails, and structures in the monument, and the government acquired additional land in the Painted Desert section. The monument became a national park in 1962. Six years after the signing of the Wilderness Act in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, wilderness areas (where human activity is limited), were designated in the park. In 2004, President George W. Bush signed a bill authorizing the eventual expansion of the park from 93,353 acres (about 146 mi2 or 378 km2) to 218,533 acres (about 341 mi2 or 884 km2). Theft of petrified wood is still a problem. Despite a guard force of seven National Park Service rangers, fences, warning signs, and the threat of a $325 fine, an estimated of the fossil wood is stolen from the Petrified Forest every year.

Jessee Walter Fewkes, the first archeologist to visit Puerco Ruin, predicted in the late 19th century that it would yield many artifacts. Conservationist John Muir conducted the first excavations of the ruin in 1905–06. Although he did not publish his findings, he urged the federal government to preserve Petrified Forest. Professional archeological work in the park began in the early 20th century when Walter Hough conducted excavations at Puerco Ruin and other sites. In the 1930s, the Civil Works Administration funded research in the park by archeologists H.P. Mera and C.B. Cosgrove. A National Park Service resurvey of the Petrified Forest in the early 1940s identified most of the large sites with stone ruins, and subsequent surveys since 1978 have identified a total of more than 600 artifact sites, many of them small.

The earliest paleontological exploration of the region that is now the park was made in 1899 by paleobotanist Lester Ward, material of which is now deposited in the Smithsonian Institution. Muir also collected some fossil material, which is now deposited at the University of California Museum of Paleontology. In 1919, a phytosaur skull was discovered near Blue Mesa in the Petrified Forest by Ynez Mexia and sent to the Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley. In 1921, Annie Alexander, founder of the museum, visited Blue Mesa to collect more of the phytosaur and other specimens; this led to further excavations by paleontologist Charles Camp. Camp was the most prolific collector in the early 20th century, but collections were also made by Maurice Mehl (University of Missouri), Edwin Colbert (American Museum of Natural History), and park naturalists like Myrl Walker. In the latter half of the 20th century, the park was inventoried by staff at the Museum of Northern Arizona (Richard Cifelli, Will Downs), with renewed collection made by researchers from Berkeley (Robert Long, Kevin Padian), the University of Chicago (Michael Parrish), the Field Museum of Natural History (John Bolt), and Yale University (Paul Olsen). Since then, more than 300 fossil sites have been documented in the park. Research in paleontology and archeology continues at the park in the 21st century.

== Biology ==
=== Flora ===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Petrified Forest National Park encompasses two classifications; a Grama Bouteloua/Galleta Hilaria (plant) Steppe (&quot;53&quot;) potential vegetation type with a Desert Grassland (&quot;12&quot;) vegetation form and a Juniper/Pinyon pine (23) vegetation type with a Great Basin montane forest/Southwest Forest (4) vegetation form.

A 2005 survey found that 447 species of flora, of which 57 species are invasive, occur in the park. Although the park is known for its fossils and eroded badlands, its main environment is semi-desert shrub steppe. Protected from development and overgrazing for many years, the park has some of the best grassland in northeastern Arizona. In the northern part of the park, the volcanic soils of the Bidahochi Formation support abundant plant life along the Painted Desert rim. In contrast to the relatively bare badlands below, the rim is covered with shrubs, small trees, grasses, and herbs.

The dominant plants in the park include more than 100 grass species, many native to the region. Growing among the grasses are flowering species such as evening primrose, mariposa lily, and blue flax, and shrubs such as sagebrush, saltbush, and rabbitbrush. Among the wide variety of grasses are native perennial bunchgrass, blue grama, sacaton, sideoats grama, bearded sprangletop, and bush muhly. Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome (cheat grass).

Trees and shrubs grow in riparian zones along the park&#x27;s washes. Willows and cottonwoods are the larger plants, joined by rushes and sedges. Here the invasive Eurasian tamarisk, also known as saltcedar, threatens native plants by crowding, using most of the available water, and increasing soil salinity by exuding salt through its leaves.

=== Fauna ===
Some of the larger animals roaming the grasslands include pronghorns, black-tailed jackrabbits (hares), Gunnison&#x27;s prairie dogs, coyotes, bobcats and foxes. Pronghorns, the fastest land animals in North America, are capable of sprints. They are the second fastest land animal on Earth. The blood vessels in the huge, thin-walled ears of the jackrabbits act as heat exchangers. These hares are known for their bursts of speed, long leaps, and zigzag routes, all of which protect them from being eaten by golden eagles and other predators. The prairie dogs live in large colonies or &quot;towns&quot;, near which many other species find food and shelter. Coyotes dine largely on rodents but also eat fruits, reptiles, insects, small mammals, birds, and carrion.

Bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer mice and white-tailed antelope squirrels in the park&#x27;s riparian zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find food and shelter among the denser foliage, and mule deer sometimes frequent the area.

More than 16 kinds of lizards and snakes live in various habitats in the park and consume large quantities of insects, spiders, scorpions, other reptiles, and small mammals. The collared lizard, which occurs in every habitat, is the largest and most often seen. Plateau striped whiptails, a species consisting entirely of females, prefer grasslands and developed areas. Side-blotched lizards live in rocky areas of the park but are seldom seen. Gopher snakes, which sometimes imitate rattlesnakes when disturbed, are among the most common snakes in the park. The Prairie rattlesnake, the only venomous snake found in the park, prefers grasslands and shrub areas.

Seven kinds of amphibians, which drink no water but absorb it through their permeable skins, have been identified in Petrified Forest National Park. Tiger salamanders, found in grassland and near major drainages, are the only salamander species known in Arizona. Woodhouse&#x27;s toads, which are seldom seen, are the largest toads in the park. They like grasslands, riparian corridors, and developed areas. Red-spotted toads, most active in the rainy season, July through September, are found in rocky areas near streams and in canyons. The Great Plains toad, the most common toad in the park, prefers grasslands. Resident spadefoot toads include the New Mexico, plains, and Couch&#x27;s varieties.

A survey conducted in 2006 identified 216 species of birds known to have occurred in Petrified Forest National Park since the park became a protected area in 1906. Of those, 33 species breed within the park, 6 other species probably do, and 18 species live in the park year-round. Thirty-five species live in the park only during the summer and 11 species only during the winter. The greatest diversity of birds occurs during fall and winter migrations.

Raptors, songbirds, and ground birds are found in the park&#x27;s grassland, while the Puerco River&#x27;s riparian corridor is a good place for year-round residents as well as migrants such as warblers, vireos, avocets, and killdeer. Developed areas around the visitor center and museum attract western tanagers, hermit warblers, house finches, and others. Occasional shorebirds and eastern birds also visit the park.

Birds commonly seen in the park include the common raven and the western meadowlark, known for its charming song. Anna&#x27;s hummingbird, which can hover and fly backwards as well as forwards, is among the smallest birds in the park. The largest is the golden eagle, with a wingspan of up to .

== Activities ==
The park is open every day except Christmas on a schedule that varies slightly with the seasons. In 2010, it and its Painted Desert Visitor Center and Rainbow Forest Museum were open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. from May 9 through September 6 but opened as early as 8 a.m. and closed as late as 5 p.m. during other parts of the year. The Painted Desert Inn (a historic museum and bookstore) is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. year-round except Christmas. Park clocks are always set to Mountain Standard Time, as Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time.

The Painted Desert Visitor Center, designed by modernist architect Richard Neutra, is part of the Painted Desert Community Complex Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Eight other sites within the park are also on the National Register, including the Painted Desert Inn and associated cabins, the Agate House Pueblo, the Painted Desert Petroglyphs and Ruins Archeological District, Newspaper Rock Petroglyphs Archeological District, Puerco Ruin and Petroglyphs, the Flattop Site (an archeological site), the Twin Buttes Archeological District, and the 35th Parallel Route (also known as the Beale Camel Trail). The Painted Desert Inn was upgraded to a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

The visitor center, which is near the north entrance to the park, offers visitor information and shows a 20-minute orientation movie, &quot;Timeless Impressions&quot;, once every half-hour. It has a bookstore, exhibits, a restaurant open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., a gift shop, a gas station, a post office open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday through Friday, a postal drop box, and public restrooms. The Rainbow Forest Museum complex north of the park&#x27;s south entrance offers services including information and &quot;Timeless Impressions&quot; showings once every half-hour. It has a bookstore, fossil exhibits, an interactive Triassic Virtual Tour, limited food service, a gift shop, and public restrooms. The Painted Desert Inn, north of the Painted Desert Visitor Center, offers visitor information. It has a bookstore, museum exhibits (including the building itself), and public restrooms.

No campgrounds or overnight lodging are available in the park, although nearby communities such as Holbrook offer motels and other accommodations. Overnight parking is not allowed except in the case of backpackers with wilderness hiking permits. Sightseeing is available by private automobile, motorcycle, commercial tour, bicycle, and hiking. The park road, parking lots, and turn-outs are big enough to accommodate large recreational vehicles. Off-road vehicle travel, including by mountain bike, is not allowed. With a few exceptions such as unpaved Old Highway 66, bicycles must stay on paved roads such as the main park road and stay off trails and unpaved surfaces.

The park&#x27;s seven maintained hiking trails, some paved, vary in length from less than to nearly . Pets are allowed on these trails if kept on a leash, but bicycles are not. These named trails are Painted Desert Rim, Puerco Pueblo, Blue Mesa, Crystal Forest, Giant Logs, Long Logs, and Agate House. There are also nine recently developed day-hike routes on unpaved and largely unmarked routes called &quot;Off the Beaten Path&quot; hikes. Hikers and backpackers may also visit the park&#x27;s wilderness areas. Free permits are required for overnight stays; they are issued from the Painted Desert Visitor Center, Painted Desert Inn, and Rainbow Forest Museum. Most backpackers enter the wilderness at the north end of the park, where parking and an access trail are available at Painted Desert Inn. Group camping is limited to eight people. Horseback riding is allowed in the wilderness areas; water for horses is available at the service station near the Painted Desert Visitor Center. Riders and hikers are asked to travel along dry washes as much as possible to reduce the impact on fragile desert soils.

Rangers offer a variety of programs about the park. Regularly scheduled events include a Painted Desert Inn tour, a Triassic program at the Rainbow Forest Museum sunroom, a talk or walk along the Giant Logs Trail behind the museum, and a Puerco Pueblo guided walk. The park hosts special events related to Earth Science Week and National American Indian Heritage Month. On Saturdays from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day at the Painted Desert Inn, artisans from the region give cultural demonstrations related to ancient peoples, intertribal relationships, and European-descent cultures. For students and teachers, the rangers offer educational materials and field-trip talks. In some years during the summer months, artists-in-residence work in the park.

<text>Kristin Landen Davis (also listed as Kristin Lee Davis; born February 23, 1965) is an American actress and producer. She is known for playing Charlotte York in the HBO romantic comedy series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1998–2004). She received nominations at the Emmys and the Golden Globes in 2004 for her role as Charlotte, and reprised the role in the films &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008) and &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; (2010), as well as the revival of the show &quot;And Just Like That...&quot; (2021–present) on Max.

Davis&#x27;s big break came in 1995, when she was cast as the villainous Brooke Armstrong in the Fox prime time soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1995–1996). Her film credits include &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (2006), &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; (2006), &quot;Couples Retreat&quot; (2009), &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot; (2012) and &quot;Holiday in the Wild&quot; (2019). Davis made her Broadway debut playing Mabel Cantwell in the 2012 revival of &quot;The Best Man&quot;, and her West End debut playing Beth Gallagher in the original 2014 stage production of &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Davis was born on February 23, 1965, in Boulder, Colorado. She is an only child, and her parents divorced when she was a baby. She was adopted by her stepfather, then-University of Colorado Boulder professor Keith Davis, after he married her mother, Dorothy, a university data analyst, in 1968. She has three stepsisters from her father&#x27;s first marriage.

Davis appeared in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Sex and the City&quot; feature film, under the direction of executive producer Michael Patrick King. The film was a box office success and amassed $415 million at the worldwide box office, despite mixed reviews. It was Davis&#x27; first movie to reach #1 at the US box office. Davis reprised her role of Charlotte York a second time in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;, which grossed $290 million worldwide but was widely panned by critics. She remained interested in a third installment of the franchise.

In 2009, Davis co-starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;Couples Retreat&quot;, a comedy chronicling four couples who partake in therapy sessions at a tropical island resort. Jon Favreau, who also co-wrote the script, played her husband. The film opened at No. 1 during its opening weekend at the US box office, making it her second film to do so.

She made her West End debut playing Beth Gallagher in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, in March 2014.

===Additional ventures===
Shortly after the wide release of the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; feature film, in June 2008, Belk, the nation&#x27;s largest privately owned department store chain, announced a partnership with Davis. The arrangement includes a ladies&#x27; apparel and accessories line that debuted in 2008 in 125 store locations and online, with eventual plans for expanding availability to other store locations. In Belk&#x27;s press release about the product line launch, Davis cited her upbringing in South Carolina as part of her inspiration for working with the chain. In late 2009 Belk cancelled the arrangement, citing the difficult economic conditions prevailing, while Davis said she hoped to take the line elsewhere.
===Philanthropic work and recognition===
Davis is a Global Ambassador for Oxfam, and has campaigned in support of their work since 2004, travelling to locations including Haiti, Mozambique, and South Africa. In 2011 she gave a tearful interview with BBC News describing the situation at the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya where she witnessed the impact of drought.

The cosmetics company Maybelline named Davis as a celebrity spokeswoman in 2004.

During her 2009 visit to Africa, Davis, a lifelong lover of elephants, discovered an abandoned baby elephant and arranged for it to be taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center. In recognition of the attention she has brought to the plight of orphaned African elephants, Davis won the Humane Society&#x27;s 2010 Wyler Award, which is bestowed on a celebrity or public figure who has made news on behalf of animals. She is also a patron of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust which works to protect elephants and other wildlife in Kenya.

In 2023, Davis was awarded &quot;The Perfect World Foundation Award&quot; for her exceptional contributions to wildlife conservation and advocacy. This prestigious honor, often referred to as &quot;The Conservationist of the Year,&quot; recognizes individuals who have made a significant impact on the protection of biodiversity.

Davis has worked with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and is included on their list of &quot;High Profile Supporters&quot;. In 2015 she visited the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. Davis later filmed a fund-raising appeal supporting the UNHCR, and in 2016 visited Australia to promote the UNHCR&#x27;s work, focussing on the plight of women victims of sexual violence in Congo.

==Personal life==
Davis has dated Alec Baldwin, Damian Lewis,and Aaron Sorkin.

In 2011, Davis adopted a daughter, Gemma Rose Davis. In 2018, she adopted a son, Wilson. The family resides in the hills of Brentwood, Los Angeles, California.
Davis is a recovering alcoholic and says she was introduced to alcohol early as part of her Southern upbringing. &quot;Alcohol freed me. I was really shy and I didn&#x27;t know how to come out of my shell. I drank for the same reason I loved acting. I wanted to feel things and express myself and be free. And I&#x27;m not naturally that way.&quot;

<text>The Yazoo lands were the central and western regions of the U.S. state of Georgia, when its western border stretched back to the Mississippi. The Yazoo lands were named for the Yazoo nation, that lived on the lower course of the Yazoo, in what is now Mississippi.

The Yazoo lands would later become large portions of the present-day states of Alabama and Mississippi, along with portions of Spanish West Florida, which became the lower third of each state, and a narrow northern strip of land claimed by South Carolina in the Treaty of Beaufort that also stretched westward to the river, which became the two states&#x27; border counties with Tennessee.

In the 1790s, the Yazoo lands were the subject of a major political scandal in the state of Georgia, called the Yazoo land scandal. It led to Georgia&#x27;s cession of the land to the U.S. government in the Compact of 1802.

It is prescribed for obesity to people who have been unable to lose weight through exercise and dieting alone. It is a prodrug of dextromethamphetamine and dextroamphetamine.

It primarily promotes weight loss through reduced appetite, but also slightly increases metabolism.

==Contraindications==
Benzphetamine is contraindicated in patients with advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, moderate to severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, known hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to sympathomimetic amines, and glaucoma, or who have recently used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Benzphetamine should not be given to patients who are in an agitated state or who have a history of drug misuse.

==Pharmacology==
Benzphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine and is classified as an anorectic. The drug&#x27;s main function is to reduce appetite, which in turn reduces caloric intake.

Although the mechanism of action of the sympathomimetic appetite suppressants in the treatment of obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Amphetamine and related sympathomimetic medications (such as benzphetamine) are thought to stimulate the release of norepinephrine and/or dopamine from storage sites in nerve terminals of the lateral hypothalamic feeding center, thereby producing a decrease in appetite. This release is mediated through the binding of benzphetamine to VMAT2 and inhibiting its function, causing a release of these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through their reuptake transporters. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class.

Benzphetamine has a half-life of 4 to 6hours.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
Benzfetamine is the international nonproprietary name.

===Legal status===
Benzphetamine is unique in its classification as a Schedule III drug in the United States. (Most members of the amphetamine family are classified in the more highly regulated Schedule II.) Benzphetamine is metabolized by the human body into amphetamine and methamphetamine, making it one of a number of drugs to undergo in vivo conversion to a substance of higher addiction and abuse potential.

<text>The Rorschach test is a projective psychological test in which subjects&#x27; perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person&#x27;s personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly. The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach. The Rorschach can be thought of as a psychometric examination of pareidolia, the active pattern of perceiving objects, shapes, or scenery as meaningful things to the observer&#x27;s experience, the most common being faces or other patterns of forms that are not present at the time of the observation. In the 1960s, the Rorschach was the most widely used projective test.

Although the Exner Scoring System (developed since the 1960s) claims to have addressed and often refuted many criticisms of the original testing system with an extensive body of research, some researchers continue to raise questions about the method. The areas of dispute include the objectivity of testers, inter-rater reliability, the verifiability and general validity of the test, bias of the test&#x27;s pathology scales towards greater numbers of responses, the limited number of psychological conditions which it accurately diagnoses, the inability to replicate the test&#x27;s norms, its use in court-ordered evaluations, and the proliferation of the ten inkblot images, potentially invalidating the test for those who have been exposed to them.
==History==

The use of interpreting &quot;ambiguous designs&quot; to assess an individual&#x27;s personality is an idea that goes back to Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli. Interpretation of inkblots was central to a game, &quot;Gobolinks&quot;, from the late 19th century. The Rorschach test, however, was the first systematic approach of this kind.

After studying 300 mental patients and 100 control subjects, in 1921 Hermann Rorschach wrote his book &quot;Psychodiagnostik&quot;, which was to form the basis of the inkblot test. After experimenting with several hundred inkblots which he drew himself, he selected a set of ten for their diagnostic value. Although he had served as Vice President of the Swiss Psychoanalytic Society, Rorschach had difficulty in publishing the book and it attracted little attention when it first appeared. Rorschach died the following year.

It has been suggested that Rorschach&#x27;s use of inkblots may have been influenced by German doctor Justinus Kerner who, in 1857, had published a popular book of poems, each of which was inspired by an accidental inkblot. French psychologist Alfred Binet had also experimented with inkblots as a creativity test, and, after the turn of the century, psychological experiments where inkblots were utilized multiplied, with aims such as studying imagination and consciousness.

In 1927, the newly founded publishing house purchased Rorschach&#x27;s book &quot;Psychodiagnostik&quot; from the inventory of Ernst Bircher. Huber remains the publisher of the test and related book, with Rorschach a registered trademark of Swiss publisher Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG. The work has been described as &quot;a densely written piece couched in dry, scientific terminology&quot;.

After Rorschach&#x27;s death, the original test scoring system was improved by Samuel Beck, Bruno Klopfer and others. John E. Exner summarized some of these later developments in the &quot;comprehensive system&quot;, at the same time trying to make the scoring more statistically rigorous. Some systems are based on the psychoanalytic concept of object relations. The Exner system remains very popular in the United States, while in Europe other methods sometimes dominate, such as that described in the textbook by , which is closer to the original Rorschach system and rooted more deeply in the original psychoanalysis principles.

Rorschach never intended the inkblots to be used as a general personality test, but developed them as a tool for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. It was not until 1939 that the test was used as a projective test of personality, a use of which Rorschach had always been skeptical. Interviewed in 2012 for a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Rita Signer, curator of the Rorschach Archives in Bern, Switzerland, suggested that the blots selected by Rorschach were not random, but rather were carefully chosen to be as ambiguous and &quot;conflicted&quot; as possible.

==Method==
The Rorschach test is appropriate for subjects from the age of five to adulthood. The administrator and subject typically sit next to each other at a table, with the administrator slightly behind the subject. Side-by-side seating of the examiner and the subject is used to reduce any effects of inadvertent cues from the examiner to the subject. In other words, side-by-side seating mitigates the possibility that the examiner will accidentally influence the subject&#x27;s responses. This is to facilitate a &quot;relaxed but controlled atmosphere&quot;.

There are ten official inkblots, each printed on a separate white card, approximately 18 by 24 cm in size. Each of the blots has near perfect bilateral symmetry. Five inkblots are of black ink, two are of black and red ink and three are multicolored, on a white background.

After the test subject has seen and responded to all of the inkblots (&quot;free association&quot; phase), the tester then presents them again one at a time in a set sequence for the subject to study: the subject is asked to note where they see what they originally saw and what makes it look like that (&quot;inquiry&quot; phase). The subject is usually asked to hold the cards and may rotate them. Whether the cards are rotated, and other related factors such as whether permission to rotate them is asked, may expose personality traits and normally contributes to the assessment.

As the subject is examining the inkblots, the psychologist writes down everything the subject says or does, no matter how trivial. Analysis of responses is recorded by the test administrator using a tabulation and scoring sheet and, if required, a separate location chart.

The general goal of the test is to provide data about cognition and personality variables such as motivations, response tendencies, cognitive operations, affectivity, and personal/interpersonal perceptions. The underlying assumption is that an individual will class external stimuli based on person-specific perceptual sets, and including needs, base motives, conflicts, and that this clustering process is representative of the process used in real-life situations.

Methods of interpretation differ. Rorschach scoring systems have been described as a system of pegs on which to hang one&#x27;s knowledge of personality. The most widely used method in the United States is based on the work of Exner. Administration of the test to a group of subjects, by means of projected images, has also occasionally been performed, but mainly for research rather than diagnostic purposes.

Test administration is not to be confused with test interpretation:

The interpretation of a Rorschach record is a complex process. It requires a wealth of knowledge concerning personality dynamics generally as well as considerable experience with the Rorschach method specifically. Proficiency as a Rorschach &quot;administrator&quot; can be gained within a few months. However, even those who are able and qualified to become Rorschach &quot;interpreters&quot; usually remain in a &quot;learning stage&quot; for a number of years.
===Features or categories===
The interpretation of the Rorschach test is not based primarily on the contents of the response, i.e., &quot;what&quot; the individual sees in the inkblot (the &quot;content&quot;). In fact, the contents of the response are only a comparatively small portion of a broader cluster of variables that are used to interpret the Rorschach data: for instance, information is provided by the time taken before providing a response for a card can be significant (taking a long time can indicate &quot;shock&quot; on the card). As well as by any comments the subject may make in addition to providing a direct response.

In particular, information about &quot;determinants&quot; (the aspects of the inkblots that triggered the response, such as form and color) and &quot;location&quot; (which details of the inkblots triggered the response) is often considered more important than content, although there is contrasting evidence.
&quot;Popularity&quot; and &quot;originality&quot; of responses can also be considered as basic dimensions in the analysis.
====Content====
The goal in coding content of the Rorschach is to categorize the objects that the subject describes in response to the inkblot. There are 27 established codes for identifying the name of the descriptive object. The codes are classified and include terms such as &quot;human&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;, &quot;animal&quot;, &quot;abstract&quot;, &quot;clothing&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, and &quot;x-ray&quot;, to name a few. Content described that does not have a code already established should be coded using the code &quot;idiographic contents&quot; with the shorthand code being &quot;Idio.&quot; Items are also coded for statistical popularity (or, conversely, originality).

More than any other feature in the test, content response can be controlled consciously by the subject, and may be elicited by very disparate factors, which makes it difficult to use content alone to draw any conclusions about the subject&#x27;s personality; with certain individuals, content responses may potentially be interpreted directly, and some information can at times be obtained by analyzing thematic trends in the whole set of content responses (which is only feasible when several responses are available), but in general content cannot be analyzed outside of the context of the entire test record.

====Location====
Identifying the location of the subject&#x27;s response is another element scored in the Rorschach system. Location refers to how much of the inkblot was used to answer the question. Administrators score the response &quot;W&quot; if the whole inkblot was used to answer the question, &quot;D&quot; if a commonly described part of the blot was used, &quot;Dd&quot; if an uncommonly described or unusual detail was used, or &quot;S&quot; if the white space in the background was used. A score of W is typically associated with the subject&#x27;s motivation to interact with his or her surrounding environment. D is interpreted as one having efficient or adequate functioning. A high frequency of responses coded Dd indicate some maladjustment within the individual. Responses coded S indicate an oppositional or uncooperative test subject.

====Determinants====
Systems for Rorschach scoring generally include a concept of &quot;determinants&quot;: These are the factors that contribute to establishing the similarity between the inkblot and the subject&#x27;s content response about it. They can also represent certain basic experiential-perceptual attitudes, showing aspects of the way a subject perceives the world. Rorschach&#x27;s original work used only &quot;form&quot;, &quot;color&quot; and &quot;movement&quot; as determinants. However currently, another major determinant considered is &quot;shading&quot;, which was inadvertently introduced by poor printing quality of the inkblots. Rorschach initially disregarded shading, since the inkblots originally featured uniform saturation, but later recognized it as a significant factor.

&quot;Form&quot; is the most common determinant, and is related to intellectual processes. &quot;Color&quot; responses often provide direct insight into one&#x27;s emotional life. &quot;Movement&quot; and &quot;shading&quot; have been considered more ambiguously, both in definition and interpretation. Rorschach considered &quot;movement&quot; only as the experiencing of actual motion, while others have widened the scope of this determinant, taking it to mean that the subject sees something &quot;going on&quot;.

More than one determinant can contribute to the formation of the subject&#x27;s perception. Fusion of two determinants is taken into account, while also assessing which of the two constituted the primary contributor. For example, &quot;&quot;form&quot;-&quot;color&quot; implies a more refined control of impulse than &quot;color&quot;-&quot;form&quot;&quot;. It is, indeed, from the relation and balance among determinants that personality can be most readily inferred.

===Symmetry of the test items===
A characteristic of the Rorschach inkblots is their symmetry. For many, this is unexceptional, but Rorschach, and subsequent researchers, considered the issue. Rorschach experimented with both asymmetric and symmetric images before choosing the latter, giving the explanation:
Asymmetric figures are rejected by many subjects; symmetry supplied part of the necessary artistic composition. It has a disadvantage in that it tends to make answers somewhat stereotyped. On the other hand, symmetry makes conditions the same for right and left handed subjects; furthermore, it facilitates interpretation for certain blocked subjects. Finally, symmetry makes possible the interpretation of whole scenes.
===Exner scoring system===
The &quot;Exner scoring system&quot;, also known as the &quot;Rorschach Comprehensive System&quot; (RCS), is the standard method for interpreting the Rorschach test. It was developed in the 1960s by John E. Exner, as a more rigorous system of analysis. It has been extensively validated and shows high inter-rater reliability.
In 1969, Exner published &quot;The Rorschach Systems&quot;, a concise description of what would be later called &quot;the Exner system&quot;. He later published a study in multiple volumes called &quot;The Rorschach: A Comprehensive system&quot;, the most accepted full description of his system.

Creation of the new system was prompted by the realization that at least five related, but ultimately different methods were in common use at the time, with a sizeable minority of examiners not employing any recognized method at all, basing instead their judgment on subjective assessment, or arbitrarily mixing characteristics of the various standardized systems.

The key components of the Exner system are the clusterization of Rorschach variables and a sequential search strategy to determine the order in which to analyze them, framed in the context of standardized administration, objective, reliable coding and a representative normative database.
The system places a lot of emphasis on a cognitive triad of &quot;information processing&quot;, related to how the subject processes input data, &quot;cognitive mediation&quot;, referring to the way information is transformed and identified, and &quot;ideation&quot;.

In the system, responses are scored with reference to their level of vagueness or synthesis of multiple images in the blot, the location of the response, which of a variety of determinants is used to produce the response (i.e., what makes the inkblot look like what it is said to resemble), the form quality of the response (to what extent a response is faithful to how the actual inkblot looks), the contents of the response (what the respondent actually sees in the blot), the degree of mental organizing activity that is involved in producing the response, and any illogical, incongruous, or incoherent aspects of responses. &quot;Bat&quot; is a popular response to the first card.

Using the scores for these categories, the examiner then performs a series of calculations producing a structural summary of the test data. The results of the structural summary are interpreted using existing research data on personality characteristics that have been demonstrated to be associated with different kinds of responses.

With the Rorschach plates (the ten inkblots), the area of each blot which is distinguished by the client is noted and coded—typically as &quot;commonly selected&quot; or &quot;uncommonly selected&quot;. There were many different methods for coding the areas of the blots. Exner settled upon the area coding system promoted by S. J. Beck (1944 and 1961). This system was in turn based upon Klopfer&#x27;s (1942) work.

As pertains to response form, a concept of &quot;form quality&quot; was present from the earliest of Rorschach&#x27;s works, as a subjective judgment of how well the form of the subject&#x27;s response matched the inkblots (Rorschach would give a higher form score to more &quot;original&quot; yet good form responses), and this concept was followed by other methods, especially in Europe; in contrast, the Exner system solely defines &quot;good form&quot; as a matter of word occurrence frequency, reducing it to a measure of the subject&#x27;s distance to the population average.
===Performance assessment system (R-PAS)===

Rorschach performance assessment system (R-PAS) is a scoring method created by several members of the Rorschach Research Council. They believed that the Exner scoring system was in need of an update, but after Exner&#x27;s death, the Exner family forbade any changes to be made to the Comprehensive System. Therefore, they established a new system: the R-PAS. It is an attempt at creating a current, empirically based, and internationally focused scoring system that is easier to use than Exner&#x27;s Comprehensive System. The R-PAS manual is intended to be a comprehensive tool for administering, scoring, and interpreting the Rorschach. The manual consists of two chapters that are basics of scoring and interpretation, aimed for use for novice Rorschach users, followed by numerous chapters containing more detailed and technical information.

In terms of updated scoring, the authors only selected variables that have been empirically supported in the literature. The authors did not create new variables or indices to be coded, but systematically reviewed variables that had been used in past systems. While all of these codes have been used in the past, many have been renamed to be more face valid and readily understood. Scoring of the indices has been updated (e.g. utilizing percentiles and standard scores) to make the Rorschach more in line with other popular personality measures. Preliminary evidence suggests that the R-PAS exhibits good inter-rater reliability.

In addition to providing coding guidelines to score examinee responses, the R-PAS provides a system to code an examinee&#x27;s behavior during Rorschach administration. These behavioral codes are included as it is believed that the behaviors exhibited during testing are a reflection of someone&#x27;s task performance and supplements the actual responses given. This allows generalizations to be made between someone&#x27;s responses to the cards and their actual behavior.

The R-PAS also recognized that scoring on many of the Rorschach variables differed across countries. Therefore, starting in 1997, Rorschach protocols from researchers around the world were compiled. After compiling protocols for over a decade, a total of 15 adult samples were used to provide a normative basis for the R-PAS. The protocols represent data gathered in the United States, Europe, Israel, Argentina and Brazil.

===Cultural differences===
Comparing North American Exner normative data with data from European and South American subjects showed marked differences in some features, some of which impact important variables, while others (such as the average number of responses) coincide.
For instance, texture response is typically zero in European subjects (if interpreted as a need for closeness, in accordance with the system, a European would seem to express it only when it reaches the level of a &quot;craving&quot; for closeness), and there are fewer &quot;good form&quot; responses, to the point where schizophrenia may be suspected if data were correlated to the North American norms.
Form is also often the only determinant expressed by European subjects; while color is less frequent than in American subjects, color-form responses are comparatively frequent in opposition to form-color responses; since the latter tend to be interpreted as indicators of a defensive attitude in processing affect, this difference could stem from a higher value attributed to spontaneous expression of emotions.

The differences in form quality are attributable to purely cultural aspects: different cultures will exhibit different &quot;common&quot; objects (French subjects often identify a chameleon in card VIII, which is normally classed as an &quot;unusual&quot; response, as opposed to other animals like cats and dogs; in Scandinavia, &quot;Christmas elves&quot; &quot;(nisser)&quot; is a popular response for card II, and &quot;musical instrument&quot; on card VI is popular for Japanese people), and different languages will exhibit semantic differences in naming the same object (the figure of card IV is often called a &quot;troll&quot; by Scandinavians and an &quot;ogre&quot; by French people).
Many of Exner&#x27;s &quot;popular&quot; responses (those given by at least one third of the North American sample used) seem to be universally popular, as shown by samples in Europe, Japan and South America, while specifically card IX&#x27;s &quot;human&quot; response, the crab or spider in card X and one of either the butterfly or the bat in card I appear to be characteristic of North America.

Form quality, popular content responses and locations are the only coded variables in the Exner systems that are based on frequency of occurrence, and thus immediately subject to cultural influences; therefore, cultural-dependent interpretation of test data may not necessarily need to extend beyond these components.

The cited language differences can result in misinterpretation if not administered in the subject&#x27;s native language or a very well mastered second language, and interpreted by a master speaker of that language. For example, a bow tie is a frequent response for the center detail of card III, but since the equivalent term in French translates to &quot;butterfly tie&quot;, an examiner not appreciating this language nuance may code the response differently from what is expected.

==Inkblots==
Below are the ten inkblots printed in &quot;Rorschach Test – Psychodiagnostic Plates&quot;, together with the most frequent responses for either the whole image or the most prominent details according to various authors.

==Usage==

===United States===
The Rorschach test is used almost exclusively by psychologists. Up to 2007 forensic psychologists used the Rorschach 36% of the time.
In custody cases, 23% of psychologists use the Rorschach to examine a child.
Another survey found that 124 out of 161 (77%) of clinical psychologists engaging in assessment services utilize the Rorschach, and 80% of psychology graduate programs teach its use.
Another study found that its use by clinical psychologists was only 43%, while it was used less than 24% of the time by school psychologists.

During World War II, United States Army Medical Corps chief psychiatrist Douglas Kelley and psychologist Gustave Gilbert administered the Rorschach test to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first Nuremberg trials, and the test scores were published some decades later.

Because of the large amount of data used to interpret the test, psychologist Zygmunt Piotrowski, began work to computerize ink blot interpretation in the 1950s and 1960s. This work included over 1,000 rules and included no summary nor narrative conclusions. A subsequent computerized interpretation of Rorschach test scores, that included summary and conclusions was developed in the 1970s by psychologists Perline and Cabanski, and marketed internationally. This computerized interpretation of the test was used to interpret the set of scores developed by Gilbert on Nazi Hermann Goering along with several other Nazis while awaiting trial at Nuremberg Prison.

In the 1980s psychologist John Exner developed a computerized interpretation of the Rorschach test, based on his own scoring system, the Exner Comprehensive System. Presently, of the three computerized assessments, only the Exner system is available on the market.

The arguments for or against computerized assessment of the Rorschach is likely to remain unresolved for some time, as there is no absolute correct interpretation against which the different markers (scores) denoting mental health can be compared. Although scores for a theoretically typical healthy adult have been proposed and reasonable attempts to standardize the computer interpretation against these scores have been obtained, more work in this area needs to be done.

===United Kingdom===
Many psychologists in the United Kingdom do not trust its efficacy and it is rarely used. Although skeptical about its scientific validity, some psychologists use it in therapy and coaching &quot;as a way of encouraging self-reflection and starting a conversation about the person&#x27;s internal world.&quot; It is still used, however, by some mental health organisations such as the Tavistock Clinic. In a survey done in the year 2000, 20% of psychologists in correctional facilities used the Rorschach while 80% used the MMPI.

===Japan===
Shortly after the publication of Rorschach&#x27;s book, Japanese psychologist Yuzaburo Uchida came across a copy in a second-hand book shop. His positive reaction created an enduring popularity for the tests in Japan. The Japanese Rorschach Society is the world&#x27;s largest and the test is &quot;routinely put to a wide range of purposes&quot;, being described in 2012 as &quot;more popular than ever&quot;.

==Controversy==
Some skeptics consider the Rorschach inkblot test pseudoscience, as several studies suggested that conclusions reached by test administrators since the 1950s were akin to cold reading. In the 1959 edition of &quot;Mental Measurement Yearbook&quot;, Lee Cronbach (former President of the Psychometric Society and American Psychological Association) is quoted in a review: &quot;The test has repeatedly failed as a prediction of practical criteria. There is nothing in the literature to encourage reliance on Rorschach interpretations.&quot; In addition, major reviewer Raymond J. McCall writes (p. 154): &quot;Though tens of thousands of Rorschach tests have been administered by hundreds of trained professionals since that time (of a previous review), and while many relationships to personality dynamics and behavior have been hypothesized, the vast majority of these relationships &quot;have never been validated empirically&quot;, despite the appearance of more than 2,000 publications about the test.&quot; A moratorium on its use was called for in 1999.

A 2003 report by Wood and colleagues had more mixed views: &quot;More than 50 years of research have confirmed Lee J. Cronbach&#x27;s (1970) final verdict: that some Rorschach scores, though falling woefully short of the claims made by proponents, nevertheless possess &#x27;validity greater than chance&#x27; (p. 636). [...] Its value as a measure of thought disorder in schizophrenia research is well accepted. It is also used regularly in research on dependency, and, less often, in studies on hostility and anxiety. Furthermore, substantial evidence justifies the use of the Rorschach as a clinical measure of intelligence and thought disorder.&quot;

===Test materials===
The basic premise of the test is that objective meaning can be extracted from responses to blots of ink which are supposedly meaningless. Supporters of the Rorschach inkblot test believe that the subject&#x27;s response to an ambiguous and meaningless stimulus can provide insight into their thought processes, but it is not clear &quot;how&quot; this occurs. Also, recent research shows that the blots are not entirely meaningless, and that a patient typically responds to meaningful as well as ambiguous aspects of the blots. Reber (1985) describes the blots as merely &quot;...the vehicle for the interaction...&quot; between client and therapist, concluding: &quot;...the usefulness of the Rorschach will depend upon the sensitivity, empathy and insightfulness of the tester totally independently of the Rorschach itself. An intense dialogue about the wallpaper or the rug would do as well provided that both parties believe.&quot;

===Illusory and invisible correlations===
In the 1960s, research by psychologists Loren and Jean Chapman, at the University of Wisconsin, published in the &quot;Journal of Abnormal Psychology&quot;, showed that at least some of the apparent validity of the Rorschach was due to an illusion. At that time, the five signs most often interpreted as diagnostic of homosexuality were 1) buttocks and anuses; 2) feminine clothing; 3) male or female sex organs; 4) human figures without male or female features; and 5) human figures with both male and female features. The Chapmans surveyed 32 experienced testers about their use of the Rorschach to diagnose homosexuality. At this time homosexuality was regarded as a psychopathology, and the Rorschach was the most popular projective test. The testers reported that homosexual men had shown the five signs more frequently than heterosexual men. Despite these beliefs, analysis of the results showed that heterosexual men were just as likely to report these signs, which were therefore totally ineffective for determining homosexuality. The five signs did, however, match the guesses students made about which imagery would be associated with homosexuality.

The Chapmans investigated the source of the testers&#x27; false confidence. In one experiment, students read through a stack of cards, each with a Rorschach blot, a sign and a pair of &quot;conditions&quot; (which might include homosexuality). The information on the cards was fictional, although subjects were told it came from case studies of real patients. The students reported that the five invalid signs were associated with homosexuality, even though the cards had been constructed so there was no association at all. The Chapmans repeated this experiment with another set of cards, in which the association was negative; the five signs were never reported by homosexuals. The students still reported seeing a strong positive correlation. These experiments showed that the testers&#x27; prejudices could result in them &quot;seeing&quot; non-existent relationships in the data. The Chapmans called this phenomenon &quot;illusory correlation&quot; and it has since been demonstrated in many other contexts.

A related phenomenon called &quot;invisible correlation&quot; applies when people fail to see a strong association between two events because it does not match their expectations. This was also found in clinicians&#x27; interpretations of the Rorschach. Homosexual men are more likely to see a monster on Card IV or a part-animal, part-human figure in Card V. Almost all of the experienced clinicians in the Chapmans&#x27; survey missed these valid signs. The Chapmans ran an experiment with fake Rorschach responses in which these valid signs were always associated with homosexuality. The subjects missed these perfect associations and instead reported that invalid signs, such as buttocks or feminine clothing, were better indicators.

In 1992, the psychologist Stuart Sutherland argued that these artificial experiments are easier than the real-world use of the Rorschach, and hence they probably underestimated the errors that testers were susceptible to. He described the continuing popularity of the Rorschach after the Chapmans&#x27; research as a &quot;glaring example of irrationality among psychologists&quot;.

===Tester projection===
Some critics argue that the testing psychologist must also project onto the patterns. A possible example sometimes attributed to the psychologist&#x27;s subjective judgement is that responses are coded (among many other things), for &quot;Form Quality&quot;: in essence, whether the subject&#x27;s response fits with how the blot actually looks. Superficially this might be considered a subjective judgment, depending on how the examiner has internalized the categories involved. But with the Exner system of scoring, much of the subjectivity is eliminated or reduced by use of frequency tables that indicate how often a particular response is given by the population in general. Another example is that the response &quot;bra&quot; was considered a &quot;sex&quot; response by male psychologists, but a &quot;clothing&quot; response by females.
In Exner&#x27;s system, however, such a response is always coded as &quot;clothing&quot; unless there is a clear sexual reference in the response.

Third parties could be used to avoid this problem, but the Rorschach&#x27;s inter-rater reliability has been questioned. That is, in some studies the scores obtained by two independent scorers do not match with great consistency.
This conclusion was challenged in studies using large samples reported in 2002.

===Validity===
When interpreted as a projective test, results are poorly verifiable. The Exner system of scoring (also known as the &quot;Comprehensive System&quot;) is meant to address this, and has all but displaced many earlier (and less consistent) scoring systems. It makes heavy use of what factor (shading, color, outline, etc.) of the inkblot leads to each of the tested person&#x27;s comments. Disagreements about test validity remain: while Exner proposed a rigorous scoring system, latitude remained in the actual interpretation, and the clinician&#x27;s write-up of the test record is still partly subjective.
Reber (1985) comments &quot;...there is essentially no evidence whatsoever that the test has even a shred of validity.&quot;

Nevertheless, there is substantial research indicating the utility of the measure for a few scores. Several scores correlate well with general intelligence. One such scale is R, the total number of responses; this reveals the questionable side-effect that more intelligent people tend to be elevated on many pathology scales, since many scales do not correct for high R: if a subject gives twice as many responses overall, it is more likely that some of these will seem &quot;pathological&quot;. Also correlated with intelligence are the scales for Organizational Activity, Complexity, Form Quality, and Human Figure responses. The same source reports that validity has also been shown for detecting such conditions as schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders; thought disorders; and personality disorders (including borderline personality disorder). There is some evidence that the Deviant Verbalizations scale relates to bipolar disorder. The authors conclude that &quot;Otherwise, the Comprehensive System doesn&#x27;t appear to bear a consistent relationship to psychological disorders or symptoms, personality characteristics, potential for violence, or such health problems as cancer&quot;.
(Cancer is mentioned because a small minority of Rorschach enthusiasts have claimed the test can predict cancer.)

===Reliability===
It is also thought that the test&#x27;s reliability can depend substantially on details of the testing procedure, such as where the tester and subject are seated, any introductory words, verbal and nonverbal responses to subjects&#x27; questions or comments, and how responses are recorded. Exner has published detailed instructions, but Wood et al. cite many court cases where these had not been followed. Similarly, the procedures for coding responses are fairly well specified but extremely time-consuming leaving them very subject to the author&#x27;s style and the publisher to the quality of the instructions (such as was noted with one of Bohm&#x27;s textbooks in the 1950s) as well as clinic workers (which would include examiners) being encouraged to cut corners.

United States courts have challenged the Rorschach as well. &quot;Jones v Apfel&quot; (1997) stated (quoting from &quot;Attorney&#x27;s Textbook of Medicine&quot;) that Rorschach &quot;results do not meet the requirements of standardization, reliability, or validity of clinical diagnostic tests, and interpretation thus is often controversial&quot;. In &quot;State ex rel H.H.&quot; (1999) where under cross-examination Bogacki stated under oath &quot;many psychologists do not believe much in the validity or effectiveness of the Rorschach test&quot; and &quot;US v Battle&quot; (2001) ruled that the Rorschach &quot;does not have an objective scoring system.&quot;

===Population norms===

Another controversial aspect of the test is its statistical norms. Exner&#x27;s system was thought to possess normative scores for various populations. But, beginning in the mid-1990s others began to try to replicate or update these norms and failed. In particular, discrepancies seemed to focus on indices measuring narcissism, disordered thinking, and discomfort in close relationships. Lilienfeld and colleagues, who are critical of the Rorschach, have stated that this proves that the Rorschach tends to &quot;overpathologise normals&quot;. Although Rorschach proponents, such as Hibbard, suggest that high rates of pathology detected by the Rorschach accurately reflect increasing psychopathology in society, the Rorschach also identifies half of all test-takers as possessing &quot;distorted thinking&quot;, a false positive rate unexplained by current research.

The accusation of &quot;over-pathologising&quot; has also been considered by Meyer et al. (2007). They presented an international collaborative study of 4704 Rorschach protocols, obtained in 21 different samples, across 17 countries, with only 2% showing significant elevations on the index of perceptual and thinking disorder, 12% elevated on indices of depression and hyper-vigilance and 13% elevated on persistent stress overload—all in line with expected frequencies among non-patient populations.

===Applications===
The test is also controversial because of its common use in court-ordered evaluations. This controversy stems, in part, from the limitations of the Rorschach, with no additional data, in making official diagnoses from the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-IV). Irving B. Weiner (co-developer with John Exner of the Comprehensive system) has stated that the Rorschach &quot;is a measure of personality functioning, and it provides information concerning aspects of personality structure and dynamics that make people the kind of people they are. Sometimes such information about personality characteristics is helpful in arriving at a differential diagnosis, if the alternative diagnoses being considered have been well conceptualized with respect to specific or defining personality characteristics&quot;.
In the vast majority of cases, anyway, the Rorschach test was not singled out but used as one of several in a battery of tests, and despite the criticism of usage of the Rorschach in the courts, out of 8,000 cases in which forensic psychologists used Rorschach-based testimony, the appropriateness of the instrument was challenged only six times, and the testimony was ruled inadmissible in only one of those cases. One study has found that use of the test in courts has increased by three times in the decade between 1996 and 2005, compared to the previous fifty years. Others however have found that its usage by forensic psychologists has decreased.

Exner and others have claimed that the Rorschach test is capable of detecting suicidality.

===Protection of test items and ethics===
Psychologists object to the publication of psychological test material out of concerns that a patient&#x27;s test responses will be influenced (&quot;primed&quot;) by previous exposure. The Canadian Psychological Association takes the position that, &quot;Publishing the questions and answers to any psychological test compromises its usefulness&quot; and calls for &quot;keeping psychological tests out of the public domain.&quot; The same statement quotes their president as saying, &quot;The CPA&#x27;s concern is not with the publication of the cards and responses to the Rorschach test per se, for which there is some controversy in the psychological literature and disagreement among experts, but with the larger issue of the publication and dissemination of psychological test content&quot;.

From a legal standpoint, the Rorschach test images have been in the public domain for many years in most countries, particularly those with a copyright term of up to 70 years &quot;post mortem auctoris&quot;. They have been in the public domain in Hermann Rorschach&#x27;s native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author&#x27;s death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law. They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law where all works published before 1923 are considered to be in the public domain. This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose. William Poundstone was, perhaps, first to make them public in his 1983 book &quot;Big Secrets&quot;, where he also described the method of administering the test.

The American Psychological Association (APA) has a code of ethics that supports &quot;freedom of inquiry and expression&quot; and helping &quot;the public in developing informed judgments&quot;.
It claims that its goals include &quot;the welfare and protection of the individuals and groups with whom psychologists work&quot;, and it requires that psychologists &quot;make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity and security of test materials&quot;. The APA has also raised concerns that the dissemination of test materials might impose &quot;very concrete harm to the general public&quot;. It has not taken a position on publication of the Rorschach plates but noted &quot;there are a limited number of standardized psychological tests considered appropriate for a given purpose&quot;. A public statement by the British Psychological Society expresses similar concerns about psychological tests (without mentioning any test by name) and considers the &quot;release of [test] materials to unqualified individuals&quot; to be misuse if it is against the wishes of the test publisher.
In his 1998 book &quot;Ethics in Psychology&quot;, Gerald Koocher notes that some believe &quot;reprinting copies of the Rorschach plates ... and listing common responses represents a serious unethical act&quot; for psychologists and is indicative of &quot;questionable professional judgment&quot;.
Another association, the (literally: Italian Association of Strategic Psychotherapy), recommend that even information about the purpose of the test or any detail of its administration should be kept from the public, even though &quot;cheating&quot; the test is held to be practically impossible.

On September 9, 2008, Hogrefe attempted to claim copyright over the Rorschach ink blots during filings of a complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization against the Brazilian psychologist Ney Limonge. These complaints were denied. Further complaints were sent to two other websites that contained information similar to the Rorschach test in May 2009 by legal firm Schluep and Degen of Switzerland.

Psychologists have sometimes refused to disclose tests and test data to courts when asked to do so by the parties, citing ethical reasons; it is argued that such refusals may hinder full understanding of the process by the attorneys, and impede cross-examination of the experts. APA ethical standard 1.23(b) states that the psychologist has a responsibility to document processes in detail and of adequate quality to allow reasonable scrutiny by the court.

Controversy ensued in the psychological community in 2009 when the original Rorschach plates and research results on interpretations were published in the &quot;Rorschach test&quot; article on Wikipedia. Hogrefe &amp; Huber Publishing, a German company that sells editions of the plates, called the publication &quot;unbelievably reckless and even cynical of Wikipedia&quot; and said it was investigating the possibility of legal action. Due to this controversy an was temporarily established on Wikipedia to prevent the removal of the plates.

James Heilman, an emergency room physician involved in the debate, compared it to the publication of the eye test chart: though people are likewise free to memorize the eye chart before an eye test, its general usefulness as a diagnostic tool for eyesight has not diminished. For those opposed to exposure, publication of the inkblots is described as a &quot;particularly painful development&quot;, given the tens of thousands of research papers which have, over many years, &quot;tried to link a patient&#x27;s responses to certain psychological conditions.&quot; Controversy over Wikipedia&#x27;s publication of the inkblots has resulted in the blots being published in other locations, such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. Later that year, in August 2009, two psychologists filed a complaint against Heilman with the Saskatchewan medical licensing board, arguing that his uploading of the images constituted unprofessional behavior. In 2012, two articles were published showing consequences of the publication of the images in Wikipedia. The first one studied negative attitudes towards the test generated during the Wikipedia-Rorschach debate, while the second suggested that reading the Wikipedia article could help to fake &quot;good&quot; results in the test.

Publication of the Rorschach images is also welcomed by critics who consider the test to be pseudoscience. Benjamin Radford, editor of &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine, stated that the Rorschach &quot;has remained in use more out of tradition than good evidence&quot; and was hopeful that publication of the test might finally hasten its demise.

==In art and media==
Australian artist Ben Quilty has used the Rorschach technique in his paintings, by loading impasto oil paint onto a canvas and then pressing a second, unpainted, canvas onto the first, and proceeding to create an artwork from the shape created by this method.

The mask of the fictional antihero of the same name in the graphic novel limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot; and its adaptations displays a constantly morphing inkblot based on the designs used in the tests. In the 1999 Sofia Coppola movie &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; the character of Cecilia is given the test and in David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Spider&quot; (2002) the Rorschach inkblots are incorporated into the opening of the film.

In 2022, a Malayalam language film titled &quot;Rorschach&quot; was announced with actor Mammootty in the lead role, inspiring queries and discussion in social media about the test.

The trailer for season 1 of the 2017 TV series &quot;Mindhunter&quot; features a bloody inkblot.

In &quot;&quot;, the character Doc Mitchell uses three cards from the test to give judgment on the player character who is recovering from a bullet to the head. Cards VII, VI, and II are used in that order. The player answers from a premade list of answers which then determine the player&#x27;s skill bonuses. A community mod for Card II was created due to popular agreement from the community that it looked like &quot;Two bears high fiving&quot;. This would inspire a character in the Honest Hearts addon called &quot;Two Bears High Fiving&quot;.
