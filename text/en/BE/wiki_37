<text>A moment is a mathematical expression involving the product of a distance and a physical quantity such as a force or electric charge. Moments are usually defined with respect to a fixed reference point and refer to physical quantities located some distance from the reference point. For example, the moment of force, often called torque, is the product of a force on an object and the distance from the reference point to the object. In principle, any physical quantity can be multiplied by a distance to produce a moment. Commonly used quantities include forces, masses, and electric charge distributions; a list of examples is provided later.

== Elaboration ==

In its most basic form, a moment is the product of the distance to a point, raised to a power, and a physical quantity 
(such as force or electrical charge) at that point:

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the physical quantity such as a force applied at a point, or a point charge, or a point mass, etc. If the quantity is not concentrated solely at a single point, the moment is the integral of that quantity&#x27;s density over space:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the distribution of the density of charge, mass, or whatever quantity is being considered.

More complex forms take into account the angular relationships between the distance and the physical quantity, but the above equations capture the essential feature of a moment, namely the existence of an underlying formula_5 or equivalent term. This implies that there are multiple moments (one for each value of &quot;n&quot;) and that the moment generally depends on the reference point from which the distance formula_6 is measured, although for certain moments (technically, the lowest non-zero moment) this dependence vanishes and the moment becomes independent of the reference point.

Each value of &quot;n&quot; corresponds to a different moment: the 1st moment corresponds to &quot;n&quot; = 1; the 2nd moment to &quot;n&quot; = 2, etc. The 0th moment (&quot;n&quot; = 0) is sometimes called the &quot;monopole moment&quot;; the 1st moment (&quot;n&quot; = 1) is sometimes called the &quot;dipole moment&quot;, and the 2nd moment (&quot;n&quot; = 2) is sometimes called the &quot;quadrupole moment&quot;, especially in the context of electric charge distributions.

=== Examples ===
* The &quot;moment of force&quot;, or &quot;torque&quot;, is a first moment: formula_7, or, more generally, formula_8.
* Similarly, &quot;angular momentum&quot; is the 1st moment of momentum: formula_9. Momentum itself is &quot;not&quot; a moment. 
* The &quot;electric dipole moment&quot; is also a 1st moment: formula_10 for two opposite point charges or formula_11 for a distributed charge with charge density formula_12.

Moments of mass:
* The &quot;total mass&quot; is the zeroth moment of mass.
* The &quot;center of mass&quot; is the 1st moment of mass normalized by total mass: formula_13 for a collection of point masses, or formula_14 for an object with mass distribution formula_12.
* The &quot;moment of inertia&quot; is the 2nd moment of mass: formula_16 for a point mass, formula_17 for a collection of point masses, or formula_18 for an object with mass distribution formula_12. The center of mass is often (but not always) taken as the reference point.

== Multipole moments ==
Assuming a density function that is finite and localized to a particular region, outside that region a 1/&quot;r&quot; potential may be expressed as a series of spherical harmonics:
:formula_20

The coefficients formula_21 are known as &quot;multipole moments&quot;, and take the form:
:formula_22

where formula_23 expressed in spherical coordinates formula_24 is a variable of integration. A more complete treatment may be found in pages describing multipole expansion or spherical multipole moments. (The convention in the above equations was taken from Jackson – the conventions used in the referenced pages may be slightly different.)

When formula_4 represents an electric charge density, the formula_26 are, in a sense, projections of the moments of electric charge: formula_27 is the monopole moment; the formula_28 are projections of the dipole moment, the formula_29 are projections of the quadrupole moment, etc.

== Applications of multipole moments ==
The multipole expansion applies to 1/&quot;r&quot; scalar potentials, examples of which include the electric potential and the gravitational potential. For these potentials, the expression can be used to approximate the strength of a field produced by a localized distribution of charges (or mass) by calculating the first few moments. For sufficiently large &quot;r&quot;, a reasonable approximation can be obtained from just the monopole and dipole moments. Higher fidelity can be achieved by calculating higher order moments. Extensions of the technique can be used to calculate interaction energies and intermolecular forces.

The technique can also be used to determine the properties of an unknown distribution formula_4. Measurements pertaining to multipole moments may be taken and used to infer properties of the underlying distribution. This technique applies to small objects such as molecules,
but has also been applied to the universe itself, being for example the technique employed by the WMAP and Planck experiments to analyze the cosmic microwave background radiation.

==History==
In works believed to stem from Ancient Greece, the concept of a moment is alluded to by the word (&quot;rhopḗ&quot;, &quot;inclination&quot;) and composites like (&quot;isorropa&quot;, &quot;of equal inclinations&quot;). The context of these works is mechanics and geometry involving the lever. In particular, in extant works attributed to Archimedes, the moment is pointed out in phrasings like:

:&quot;Commensurable magnitudes ( ) [A and B] are equally balanced () if their distances [to the center Γ, i.e., ΑΓ and ΓΒ] are inversely proportional () to their weights ().&quot;

Moreover, in extant texts such as &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;, moments are used to infer the center of gravity, area, and volume of geometric figures.

In 1269, William of Moerbeke translates various works of Archimedes and Eutocious into Latin. The term ῥοπή is transliterated into &quot;ropen&quot;.

Around 1450, Jacobus Cremonensis translates ῥοπή in similar texts into the Latin term &quot;momentum&quot; ( &quot;movement&quot;). The same term is kept in a 1501 translation by Giorgio Valla, and subsequently by Francesco Maurolico, Federico Commandino, Guidobaldo del Monte, Adriaan van Roomen, Florence Rivault, Francesco Buonamici, Marin Mersenne, and Galileo Galilei. That said, why was the word &quot;momentum&quot; chosen for the translation? One clue, according to Treccani, is that &quot;momento&quot; in medieval Italy, the place the early translators lived, in a transferred sense meant both a &quot;moment of time&quot; and a &quot;moment of weight&quot; (a small amount of weight that turns the scale).

In 1554, Francesco Maurolico clarifies the Latin term &quot;momentum&quot; in the work &quot;Prologi sive sermones&quot;. Here is a Latin to English translation as given by Marshall Clagett:
&quot;[...] equal weights at unequal distances do not weigh equally, but unequal weights [at these unequal distances may] weigh equally. For a weight suspended at a greater distance is heavier, as is obvious in a balance. Therefore, there exists a certain third kind of power or third difference of magnitude—one that differs from both body and weight—and this they call moment. Therefore, a body acquires weight from both quantity [i.e., size] and quality [i.e., material], but a weight receives its moment from the distance at which it is suspended. Therefore, when distances are reciprocally proportional to weights, the moments [of the weights] are equal, as Archimedes demonstrated in &quot;The Book on Equal Moments&quot;. Therefore, weights or [rather] moments like other continuous quantities, are joined at some common terminus, that is, at something common to both of them like the center of weight, or at a point of equilibrium. Now the center of gravity in any weight is that point which, no matter how often or whenever the body is suspended, always inclines perpendicularly toward the universal center.

In addition to body, weight, and moment, there is a certain fourth power, which can be called impetus or force. Aristotle investigates it in &quot;On Mechanical Questions&quot;, and it is completely different from [the] three aforesaid [powers or magnitudes]. [...]&quot;
in 1586, Simon Stevin uses the Dutch term &quot;staltwicht&quot; (&quot;parked weight&quot;) for momentum in &quot;De Beghinselen Der Weeghconst&quot;.

In 1632, Galileo Galilei publishes &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; and uses the Italian &quot;momento&quot; with many meanings, including the one of his predecessors.

In 1643, Thomas Salusbury translates some of Galilei&#x27;s works into English. Salusbury translates Latin &quot;momentum&quot; and Italian &quot;momento&quot; into the English term &quot;moment&quot;.

In 1765, the Latin term &quot;momentum inertiae&quot; (English: &quot;moment of inertia&quot;) is used by Leonhard Euler to refer to one of Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s quantities in &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;. Huygens 1673 work involving finding the center of oscillation had been stimulated by Marin Mersenne, who suggested it to him in 1646.

In 1811, the French term &quot;moment d&#x27;une force&quot; (English: &quot;moment of a force&quot;) with respect to a point and plane is used by Siméon Denis Poisson in &quot;Traité de mécanique&quot;. An English translation appears in 1842.

In 1884, the term &quot;torque&quot; is suggested by James Thomson in the context of measuring rotational forces of machines (with propellers and rotors). Today, a dynamometer is used to measure the torque of machines.

In 1893, Karl Pearson uses the term &quot;n-th moment&quot; and formula_31 in the context of curve-fitting scientific measurements. Pearson wrote in response to John Venn, who, some years earlier, observed a peculiar pattern involving meteorological data and asked for an explanation of its cause. In Pearson&#x27;s response, this analogy is used: the mechanical &quot;center of gravity&quot; is the mean and the &quot;distance&quot; is the deviation from the mean. This later evolved into moments in mathematics. The analogy between the mechanical concept of a moment and the statistical function involving the sum of the th powers of deviations was noticed by several earlier, including Laplace, Kramp, Gauss, Encke, Czuber, Quetelet, and De Forest.

<text>Albert Herter (March 2, 1871 – February 15, 1950) was an American painter, illustrator, muralist, and interior designer. He was born in New York City, studied at the Art Students League with James Carroll Beckwith, then in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens and Fernand Cormon.

He came from an artistic family; his father, Christian Herter (1839–1883), had co-founded Herter Brothers, a prominent New York interior design and furnishings firm. Herter Brothers closed in 1906, and Albert founded Herter Looms in 1909, a tapestry and textile design-and-manufacturing firm that was, in a sense, successor to his father&#x27;s firm.

==Personal==
In Paris, he met a fellow American art student, Adele McGinnis. They were married in 1893 and had three children: Everit Albert (1894–1918), Christian Archibald (1895–1966), and Lydia Adele (1898–1951). The couple honeymooned in Japan, then returned to Paris for the first years of their marriage. In 1898 they moved back to the United States and built a Mediterranean-style villa, called &quot;Près Choisis&quot; (later called &quot;The Creeks&quot;), in East Hampton, New York, with a studio for each of them. Herter&#x27;s mother built a mansion, &quot;El Mirasol,&quot; in Santa Barbara, California, where the family spent the winters. Following his mother&#x27;s death, Herter and his wife renovated the mansion and converted it into a boutique hotel. Son Everit and daughter Lydia also became artists although Everit was killed at age 24 in World War I. Son Christian became a politician, serving as governor of Massachusetts and later U.S. Secretary of State under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Adele Herter was a founding member of New York City&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Club, and is remembered as a painter of still lifes and &quot;Society&quot; portraits.

==Paintings==
Herter had an extraordinary early career, at age 19 receiving an honorable mention at the Paris Salon (1890, &quot;La Femme de Buddha&quot;), and winning prizes from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1897 Lippincott Prize, &quot;Le Soir&quot;), the American Watercolor Society (1899 Evans Prize, &quot;The Gift of Roses&quot;), and elsewhere. He was awarded medals at the 1895 Atlanta Exposition (&quot;1830&quot;, &quot;The Muse&quot;), the 1897 Nashville Exposition (&quot;The Muse&quot;), the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle (&quot;Sorrow&quot;), and the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo (&quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;The Danaides&quot;).
Herter painted a 1912 life-size double portrait of his sons, Everit (left) and Christian (right), which his friend V. Everit Macy donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Following Everit Herter&#x27;s 1918 death in World War I, the Metropolitan returned &quot;Portrait of College Boys&quot; to the artist, and Macy donated Herter&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Young Russian Nobleman&quot; in exchange.

==Illustrations==
He painted covers for the Ladies&#x27; Home Journal and other magazines, and illustrated a number of books. He created several World War I posters.
==Murals==
In 1909, Herter was commissioned by the Daughters of the American Revolution to create what was intended to be the world&#x27;s largest painted theater curtain, for the Denver Auditorium. The flat curtain was 35 feet (11 m) high and 60 feet (18 m) wide. Its theme was an allegory of the United States Declaration of Independence, and included illustrations of historical figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin.

He executed murals for buildings such as the Massachusetts Statehouse, the Wisconsin State Capitol, the Los Angeles Public Library, and the National Academy of Sciences.

His best-known work, &quot;Le Départ des poilus, août 1914&quot; (&quot;Departure of the Infantrymen, August 1914&quot;), is a mural in the Gare de Paris-Est railroad station in Paris. The Herters&#x27; elder son, Everit, volunteered to fight in World War I, and was killed in June 1918. Herter channeled his grief into this mural, which depicts soldiers leaving for war from that same railroad station. The young man at center with his arms in the air is a portrait of Everit, the woman in white at far left is a portrait of Adele Herter, and the man at far right with the bouquet of flowers is a self-portrait. Herter donated the mural to the People of France in 1926.

==Tapestries==
&quot;Though a painter by profession, Mr. Herter has a keen appreciation of tapestry texture, which he has developed by personal work at the loom. Especially interesting should be the set of 26 panels now on the looms, picturing &quot;The Story of New York&quot; back to the days when Peter Stuyvesant smoked his long-stemmed pipe and cursed in Dutch.&quot;

* &quot;The Story of New York&quot; (1912) - 28 panels, McAlpin Hotel, New York City.
* &quot;The Great Crusade&quot; (1920), Cranbrook Art Museum, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

==Interior design==

Herter designed Spanish Colonial Revival interiors for the Loew&#x27;s Warfield Theatre (1923) in San Francisco, including a mural of Spanish-style dancers above the proscenium. He designed Byzantine Revival interiors for Broadway&#x27;s Martin Beck Theatre (1924) in New York City, which was renamed the Al Hirschfeld Theatre in 2003.

==The Creeks==
In 1894, as a wedding gift from the groom&#x27;s mother, Mary Miles Herter, the couple received a parcel of land between Montauk Highway and Georgica Pond, in East Hampton, Long Island. In 1899, they built &quot;The Creeks,&quot; a 40-room, Mediterranean-style villa, designed by architect Grosvenor Atterbury. The estate featured about a mile of waterfront on the tidal estuary. The villa contained &quot;his and hers&quot; artist studios so each would have their own workspace. Adele Herter designed the extensive gardens. In 1912, Albert Herter built a larger studio, a soaring 56-by-35-foot space that doubled as a private theater, &quot;where Enrico Caruso, Isadora Duncan and Anna Pavlova performed.&quot;
One of the finest examples of a color plan in our architecture is the country place of Mr. Albert Herter at East Hampton, Long Island. Here is a large, rambling house, built so close to the sea that the blue-green of the water and the clear blue of the sky are deliberately considered as a part of the color plan. Mr. Herter&#x27;s idea was to get, if possible, the effect of a house in Sicily, and so he built the house of pinkish yellow stucco and gave it a copper roof. The sea winds have softened the texture and deepened the color of the walls to salmon, and the copper roof has been transformed into ever-changing blue-greens that repeat the colors of the sea. In front of the house there are terraces massed with flowers of orange and yellow and red, and back of the house there is a Persian garden built around blue and green Persian tiles, and great blue Italian jars. Here flowers of blue and rose, and the amethyst tones in between, are allowed. Black green trees and shrubs are used everywhere, with the general effect of one of Maxfield Parrish&#x27;s vivid Oriental gardens.

After his wife Adele&#x27;s death at &quot;The Creeks&quot; in 1946, Albert Herter moved permanently to California. After his death, his son Christian Herter sold the estate to Alfonso A. Ossorio in 1951. Ossorio used the house as a gallery to display art collections and worked for 20 years in the gardens landscaping with exotic conifer species in groves dotted with his brightly colored found object sculptures. He donated of &quot;The Creeks&quot; to the Nature Conservancy in 1975. After Ossorio&#x27;s death in 1990, the property was offered for sale by his partner, dancer Ted Dragon, at the asking price of US$25M. It is now owned by Ronald Perelman.
==El Mirasol==

Adele and Albert Herter spent a good deal of their time in California at &quot;El Mirasol&quot;, his mother&#x27;s estate in Santa Barbara, bought in 1904. Mary Miles Herter had entertained friends there, such as Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s widow Fanny Vandegrift (who later retired to and died at &quot;El Mirasol&quot; in 1914.) The parcel, comprising an entire city block, featured a Mediterranean-style mansion surrounded by gardens. Adele and Albert undertook two major decoration efforts at the estate: the first at the mansion&#x27;s initial outfitting in 1909 which incorporated earlier Herter Brothers furnishings, new Tiffany lamps designed by Albert Herter, original wall hangings and works of art by both Albert and Adele as well as by other California artists. Following the death of Albert&#x27;s mother in 1913, the estate received a new round of renovation in 1914 with its conversion into &quot;El Mirasol Hotel&quot;; Herter expanded the mansion and added 15 luxurious bungalows around the gardens. The hotel was famed not only for its balanced design and private tranquility but for its wealthy guests including the Vanderbilts, the Rockefellers, the Guggenheims, and the heirs of Charles Crocker, J. P. Morgan and Philip Danforth Armour. In 1920, Herter sold the property to Frederick C. Clift, the hotelier and attorney from the Sierras. After the 1920s, times were hard on the hotel. Under different owners it settled into primarily a retirement home for the wealthy elderly. Herter himself died at &quot;El Mirasol&quot; in 1950.

Two attic fires damaged the west wing of the mansion in 1966. Rather than repairing it, two consecutive owners tried in vain to build high-rise shopping on the lot; the buildings and gardens were bulldozed and cleared but neighbors and a citizen&#x27;s committee fought successfully against city approval of high-rise plans. The block sat empty for a few years while the Santa Barbara Museum of Art considered building a main gallery there. In December 1975 the parcel was quietly bought by Santa Barbara resident Alice Keck Park who immediately donated it to the city of Santa Barbara to become an urban park in perpetuity: Alice Keck Park Memorial Gardens.

==&quot;The Gift of Eternal Life&quot;==
Herter wrote and produced a play called &quot;The Gift of Eternal Life, An Indo-Persian Legend&quot;. It was performed at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara, March 20–23, 1929. He designed the sets and costumes, and played the part of the King. It was produced through the Drama Branch of the Community Arts Music Association of Santa Barbara. In the playbill, he acknowledged the writings of Lily Adams Beck for inspiring the Orientalist theme and &quot;much of its imagery,&quot; and said that he also used several lines written by Rabindranath Tagore and Ananda Coomaraswamy. The cast was made up primarily of locals, although Herter&#x27;s friend, dancer Ruth St. Denis, played the lead.

==Honors==
He was elected an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1906, and became a full Academician in 1943. He was a member of the Society of American Artists, the American Watercolor Society, the New York Water Color Club, the Society of Mural Painters, and the Century Club. He was made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor in 1923.

<text>Stepan Prokopovich Timoshenko (; , ; – May 29, 1972), later known as Stephen Timoshenko, was a Russian and later an American engineer and academician.

He is considered to be the father of modern engineering mechanics. An inventor and one of the pioneering mechanical engineers at the St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. A founding member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Timoshenko wrote seminal works in the areas of engineering mechanics, elasticity and strength of materials, many of which are still widely used today. Having started his scientific career in the Russian Empire, Timoshenko emigrated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes during the Russian Civil War and then to the United States.

==Biography==
Timoshenko was born in the village of Shpotovka, Uyezd of Konotop in the Chernigov Governorate which at that time was a territory of the Russian Empire (today in Konotop Raion, Sumy Oblast of Ukraine). He was ethnically Ukrainian.

He studied at a Realschule () in Romny, Poltava Governorate (now in Sumy Oblast) from 1889 to 1896. In Romny his schoolmate and friend was future famous semiconductor physicist Abram Ioffe. Timoshenko continued his education towards a university degree at the St. Petersburg State Transport University. After graduating in 1901, he stayed on teaching in this same institution from 1901 to 1903 and then worked at the Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute under Viktor Kirpichov 1903–1906. In 1905, he was sent for one year to the University of Göttingen where he worked under Ludwig Prandtl.

In the fall of 1906, he was appointed to the Chair of Strengths of Materials at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. The return to his native Ukraine turned out to be an important part of his career and also influenced his future personal life. From 1907 to 1911, as a professor at the Polytechnic Institute he did research in the earlier variant of the Finite Element Method of elastic calculations, the so-called Rayleigh method. During those years he also pioneered work on buckling, and published the first version of his famous &quot;Strength of Materials&quot; textbook. He was elected dean of the Division of Structural Engineering in 1909.

In 1911 he signed a protest against Minister for Education Kasso and was fired from the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.
In 1911 he was awarded the D. I. Zhuravski prize of the St. Petersburg State Transport University that helped him survive after losing his job. He went to St Petersburg where he worked as a lecturer and then a Professor in the &quot;Electrotechnical Institute&quot; and the St Petersburg Institute of the Railways (1911–1917). During that time he developed the theory of elasticity and the theory of beam deflection, and continued to study buckling. In 1918 he returned to Kyiv and assisted Vladimir Vernadsky in establishing the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences – the oldest academy among the Soviet republics other than Russia. In 1918–1920 Timoshenko headed the newly established Institute of Mechanics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, which today carries his name.

After the Armed Forces of South Russia of general Denikin had taken Kyiv in 1919, Timoshenko moved from Kyiv to Rostov-on-Don. After travel via Novorossiysk, Crimea and Constantinople to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, he arrived in Zagreb, where he got professorship at the Zagreb Polytechnic Institute. In 1920, during the brief liberation of Kyiv from Bolsheviks, Timoshenko traveled to the city, reunited with his family and returned with his family to Zagreb.

He is remembered for delivering lectures in Russian while using as many words in Croatian as he could; the students were able to understand him well.

===United States===
In 1922, Timoshenko moved to the United States where he worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation from 1923 to 1927, after which he became a faculty professor in the University of Michigan where he created the first bachelor&#x27;s and doctoral programs in engineering mechanics. His textbooks have been published in 36 languages. His first textbooks and papers were written in Russian; later in his life, he published mostly in English. In 1928 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Bologna. From 1936 onward he was a professor at Stanford University. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1939 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1940.

Timoshenko&#x27;s younger brothers, architect Serhii (Sergius Timoshenko, Ukrainian Minister of Transport, participant in the 1921 Second Winter Campaign against the Soviet regime, and member of the Polish Senate), and economist Volodymyr, both immigrated to the United States as well.

In 1957, ASME established a medal named after Stephen Timoshenko; he became its first recipient. The Timoshenko Medal honors Stephen P. Timoshenko as the world-renowned authority in the field of mechanical engineering and it commemorates his contributions as author and teacher. The Timoshenko Medal is given annually for distinguished contributions in applied mechanics. In 1960 he moved to Wuppertal, West Germany to be with his daughter.

In addition to his textbooks, in 1963 Timoshenko wrote a book &quot;Engineering Education in Russia&quot; and an autobiography, &quot;As I Remember&quot; in the Russian language. It was translated into English in 1968 by sponsorship of Stanford University. Jacob Pieter Den Hartog, who was Timoshenko&#x27;s co-worker in the early 1920s at Westinghouse, wrote a review in the magazine &quot;Science&quot; stating that &quot;between 1922 and 1962 he [S.P. Timoshenko] wrote a dozen books on all aspects of engineering mechanics, which are in their third or fourth U.S. edition and which have been translated into half a dozen foreign languages each, so that his name as an author and scholar is known to nearly every mechanical and civil engineer in the entire world.. Then, Den Hartog stressed: &quot;There is no question that Timoshenko did much for America. It is an equally obvious truth that America did much for Timoshenko, as it did for millions of other immigrants for all over the world. However, our autobiographer has never admitted as much to his associates and pupils who, like myself often have been pained by his casual statements in conversation. That pain is not diminished by reading these statements on the printed page and one would have wished for a little less acid and a little more human kindness.&quot;

The celebrated theory that takes into account shear deformation and rotary inertia was developed by Timoshenko in collaboration with Paul Ehrenfest. 
Thus it is referred to as Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory. This fact was testified by Timoshenko. The interrelation between Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory was investigated in the book by Wang, Reddy and Lee.

He died in 1972 and his ashes are buried in Alta Mesa Memorial Park, Palo Alto, California.

Eduard Ivanovich Grigolyuk (1923—2005) wrote several papers devoted to S.P. Timoshenko’s life and work. He also composed two books about him. Elishakoff et al. wrote several articles investigating S.P. Timoshenko’s scientific activities and the question of the priority.

An archive of his manuscripts, letters, and handwritten materials are available online.

<text>El Loco is the seventh studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top, released in 1981. It foreshadowed the band&#x27;s extensive usage of synthesizers on &quot;Eliminator, Afterburner,&quot; and to a lesser extent, &quot;Recycler,&quot; by way of employing a synthesizer on a couple tracks, played by an uncredited Linden Hudson.

==Background==
&quot;El Loco&quot; was produced by Bill Ham and recorded and originally mixed by Terry Manning. The biographer David Blayney explains in his book &quot;Sharp Dressed Men&quot; that the recording engineer Linden Hudson was involved as a pre-producer on this album. Hudson did not receive credit for engineering the tracks on &quot;Groovy Little Hippie Pad&quot; which were used on the final album mix. In 1987, most of the band&#x27;s back catalog received a controversial &quot;digitally enhanced&quot; remix treatment for CD release; however, &quot;El Loco&quot; did not receive this remix treatment and the original mix of the album has been available on CD since 1987.

On June 3, 2013, Gibbons told Joe Bosso of MusicRadar.com that the album was &quot;a really interesting turning point&quot;, explaining that the band had &quot;befriended somebody who would become an influential associate, a guy named Linden Hudson. He was a gifted songwriter and had production skills that were leading the pack at times. He brought some elements to the forefront that helped reshape what ZZ Top were doing, starting in the studio and eventually to the live stage. [He] had no fear and was eager to experiment in ways that would frighten most bands. But we followed suit, and the synthesizers started to show up on record. Manufacturers were looking for ways to stimulate sales, and these instruments started appearing on the market. One of our favorite tracks was &quot;Groovy Little Hippie Pad&quot;. Right at the very opening, there it is – the heavy sound of a synthesizer. For us, there was no turning back.&quot; Gibbons would later cite seeing a Devo soundcheck in Houston as inspiring the synthesizer line on &quot;Groovy Little Hippie Pad.&quot; However, Blayney described in his book how Hudson had composed and performed the synthesizer parts at the band&#x27;s studio in Texas, a tape of which was taken to Memphis to be mixed into the final version of the song, without being credited. The double entendres on &quot;Tube Snake Boogie&quot; and &quot;Pearl Necklace&quot; are barely disguised, while much of the record plays as flat-out goofy party rock.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote: &quot;Instead of sticking to inventive boogie chops, producer Bill Ham has refined the material until only &#x27;It&#x27;s So Hard&#x27; with Billy Gibbon&#x27;s scratchy guitar rises above the Ham&#x27;s laundering process.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; opined that &quot;the rhythm section of Dusty Hill and Frank Beard is doubtless the most pervasive around.&quot;

<doc id="278419" wikidata="Q2633301" url="?curid=278419" title="History of the United States (1964–1980)">
<text>The history of the United States from 1964 to 1980 includes the climax and end of the Civil Rights Movement; the escalation and ending of the Vietnam War; the drama of a generational revolt with its sexual freedoms and use of drugs; and the continuation of the Cold War, with its Space Race to put a man on the Moon. The economy was prosperous and expanding until the recession of 1969–70, then faltered under new foreign competition and the 1973 oil crisis. American society was polarized by the ultimately futile war and by antiwar and antidraft protests, as well as by the shocking Watergate affair, which revealed corruption and gross misconduct at the highest level of government. By 1980 and the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran, including a failed rescue attempt by U.S. armed forces, there was a growing sense of national malaise.

The period closed with the victory of conservative Republican Ronald Reagan, opening the &quot;Age of Reagan&quot; with a dramatic change in national direction. The Democratic Party split over the Vietnam War and other foreign policy issues, with a new strong dovish element based on younger voters. Many otherwise liberal Democratic &quot;hawks&quot; joined the Neoconservative movement and started supporting the Republicans—especially Reagan—based on foreign policy. Meanwhile, Republicans were generally united on a hawkish and intense American nationalism, strong opposition to Communism, support for promoting democracy and human rights, and strong support for Israel.

Memories of the mid-late 1960s and early 1970s shaped the political landscape for the next half-century. As President Bill Clinton explained in 2004, &quot;If you look back on the Sixties and think there was more good than bad, you&#x27;re probably a Democrat. If you think there was more harm than good, you&#x27;re probably a Republican.&quot;
==Johnson administration==
===Climax of liberalism===
The climax of liberalism came in the mid-1960s with the success of President Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–69) in securing congressional passage of his Great Society programs, including civil rights, the end of segregation, Medicare, extension of welfare, federal aid to education at all levels, subsidies for the arts and humanities, environmental activism, and a series of programs designed to wipe out poverty. As a 2005 American history textbook explains:
:Gradually, liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving economic and social justice. The liberalism of the early 1960s contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agenda—much influenced by Keynesian economic theory—envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs. Johnson was sure this would work.

Johnson was rewarded with an electoral landslide in 1964 against conservative Barry Goldwater, which broke the decades-long control of Congress by the conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats. However, the Republicans bounced back in 1966, and Republican Richard Nixon won the presidential election in 1968. Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited; a more conservative reaction would come with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.

===Cultural &quot;Sixties&quot;===
The term &quot;The Sixties&quot; covers inter-related cultural and political trends around the globe. This &quot;cultural decade&quot; began around 1963 with the Kennedy assassination and ending around 1974 with the Watergate scandal.

===Shift to the extremes in politics===
The common thread was a growing distrust of government to do the right thing on behalf of the people. While general distrust of high officials had been an American characteristic for two centuries, the Watergate scandal of 1973–1974 forced the resignation of President Richard Nixon, who faced impeachment, as well as criminal trials for many of his senior associates. The media was energized in its vigorous search for scandals, which deeply impacted both major parties at the national, state, and local levels. At the same time there was a growing distrust of long-powerful institutions such as big business and labor unions. The postwar consensus regarding the value of technology in solving national problems came under attack, especially nuclear power, came under heavy attack from the New Left.

Conservatives at the state and local levels increasingly emphasized the argument that the soaring crime rates indicated a failure of liberal policy in the American cities.

Meanwhile, liberalism was facing divisive issues, as the New Left challenged established liberals on such issues as the Vietnam War, and built a constituency on campuses and among younger voters. A &quot;cultural war&quot; was emerging as a triangular battle among conservatives, liberals, and the New Left, involving such issues as individual freedom, divorce, sexuality, and even topics such as hair length and musical taste.

An unexpected new factor was the emergence of the religious right as a cohesive political force that gave strong support to conservatism.

The triumphal issue for liberalism was the achievement of civil rights legislation in the 1960s, which won over the black population created a new black electorate in the South. However, it alienated many working-class ethnic whites, and opened the door for conservative white Southerners to move into the Republican Party.

In foreign policy, the war in Vietnam was a highly divisive issue in the 1970s. Nixon had introduced a policy of detente in the Cold War, but it was strongly challenged by Reagan and the conservative movement. Reagan saw the Soviet Union as an implacable enemy that had to be defeated, not compromised with. A new element emerged in Iran, with the overthrow of a pro-American government, and the emergence of the stream of hostile ayatollahs. Radical students seized the American Embassy, and held American diplomats hostage for over a year, underscoring the weaknesses of the foreign policy of Jimmy Carter.

The economic scene was in doldrums, with soaring inflation undercutting the savings pattern of millions of Americans, while unemployment remained high and growth was low. Shortages of gasoline and the local pump made the energy crisis a local reality.

Ronald Reagan in 1964–1968 emerged as the leader of a dramatic conservative shift in American politics, that undercut many of the domestic and foreign policies that had dominated the national agenda for decades.

===Civil Rights Movement===

The 1960s were marked by street protests, demonstrations, rioting, civil unrest, antiwar protests, and a cultural revolution. African American youth protested following victories in the courts regarding civil rights with street protests led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and the NAACP. King and Bevel skillfully used the media to record instances of brutality against non-violent African American protesters to tug at the conscience of the public. Activism brought about successful political change when there was an aggrieved group, such as African Americans or feminists or homosexuals, who felt the sting of bad policy over time, and who conducted long-range campaigns of protest together with media campaigns to change public opinion along with campaigns in the courts to change policy.

The assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 helped change the political mood of the country. The new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, capitalized on this situation, using a combination of the national mood and his own political savvy to push Kennedy&#x27;s agenda; most notably, the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In addition, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had an immediate impact on federal, state and local elections. Within months of its passage on August 6, 1965, one quarter of a million new black voters had been registered, one third by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout, 74%, and had more elected black-leaders than any other state. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% voter turnout, Arkansas 77.9%, and Texas 77.3%.

===Election of 1964===

In the election of 1964, Lyndon Johnson positioned himself as a moderate, contrasting himself against his GOP opponent, Barry Goldwater, who the campaign characterized as solidly conservative. Most famously, the Johnson campaign ran a commercial entitled the &quot;Daisy Girl&quot; ad, which featured a little girl picking petals from a daisy in a field, counting the petals, which then segues into a launch countdown and a nuclear explosion. Johnson soundly defeated Goldwater in the general election, winning 61.1% of the popular vote, and losing only five states in the Deep South, where blacks were not yet allowed to vote, along with Goldwater&#x27;s Arizona.

Goldwater&#x27;s race energized the conservative movement, chiefly inside the Republican party. It looked for a new leader and found one in Ronald Reagan, elected governor of California in 1966 and reelected in 1970. He ran against President Ford for the 1976 GOP nomination, and narrowly lost, but the stage was set for Reagan in 1980.

===Anti-poverty programs===

Two main goals of the Great Society social reforms were the elimination of poverty and racial injustice. New major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, and transportation were launched during this period. The Great Society in scope and sweep resembled the New Deal domestic agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, but differed sharply in types of programs enacted. The largest and most enduring federal assistance programs, launched in 1965, were Medicare, which pays for many of the medical costs of the elderly, and Medicaid, which aids the impoverished.

The centerpiece of the War on Poverty was the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which created an Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to oversee a variety of community-based antipoverty programs. The OEO reflected a fragile consensus among policymakers that the best way to deal with poverty was not simply to raise the incomes of the poor but to help them better themselves through education, job training, and community development. Central to its mission was the idea of &quot;community action&quot;, the participation of the poor in framing and administering the programs designed to help them.

===Generational revolt and counterculture===

As the 1960s progressed, increasing numbers of young people began to revolt against the social norms and conservatism from the 1950s and early 1960s as well as the escalation of the Vietnam War and Cold War. A social revolution swept through the country to create a more liberated society. As the Civil Rights Movement progressed, feminism and environmentalism movements soon grew in the midst of a sexual revolution with its distinctive protest forms, from long hair to rock music. The hippie culture, which emphasized peace, love and freedom, was introduced to the mainstream. In 1967, the Summer of Love, an event in San Francisco where thousands of young people loosely and freely united for a new social experience, helped introduce much of the world to the culture. In addition, the increased use of psychedelic drugs, such as LSD and marijuana, also became central to the movement. Music of the time also played a large role with the introduction of folk rock and later acid rock and psychedelia which became the voice of the generation. The Counterculture Revolution was exemplified in 1969 with the historic Woodstock Festival. After experiencing declining homicide rates during the Great Depression, World War II, and during the initial Cold War, the U.S. homicide rate increased by a factor of 2.5 between 1957 and 1980 while rates of rape, assault, robbery, and theft experienced similar surges and did not return to comparable levels until the 1990s.

===Conclusion of the Space Race===
Beginning with the Soviet launch of the first satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957, the United States competed with the Soviet Union for supremacy in outer space exploration. After the Soviets placed the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, in 1961, President John F. Kennedy pushed for ways in which NASA could catch up, famously urging action for a crewed mission to the Moon: &quot;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.&quot; The first crewed flights produced by this effort came from Project Gemini (1965–1966) and then by the Apollo program, which despite the tragic loss of the Apollo 1 crew, achieved Kennedy&#x27;s goal by landing the first astronauts on the Moon with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.

Having lost the race to the Moon, the Soviets shifted their attention to orbital space stations, launching the first (Salyut 1) in 1971. The U.S. responded with the Skylab orbital workstation, in use from 1973 through 1974. With détente, a time of relatively improved Cold War relations between the United States and the Soviets, the two superpowers developed a cooperative space mission: the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project. This 1975 joint mission was the last crewed space flight for the U.S. until the Space Shuttle flights of 1981 and has been described as the symbolic end of the Space Race. The Space Race sparked unprecedented increases in spending on education and pure research, which accelerated scientific advancements and led to beneficial spin-off technologies.

===Vietnam War===

The Containment policy meant fighting communist expansion where ever it occurred, and the Communists aimed where the American allies were weakest. Johnson&#x27;s primary commitment was to his domestic policy, so he tried to minimize public awareness and congressional oversight of the operations in the war. Most of his advisers were pessimistic about the long term possibilities, and Johnson feared that if Congress took control, it would demand &quot;Why Not Victory&quot;, as Barry Goldwater put it, rather than containment. Although American involvement steadily increased, Johnson refused to allow the reserves or the National Guard to serve in Vietnam, because that would involve congressional oversight. In August 1964 Johnson secured almost unanimous support in Congress for the &quot;Gulf of Tonkin Resolution&quot;, which gave the president very broad discretion to use military force as he saw fit. In July 1965, after extensive consultation and no publicity Johnson dramatically escalated the war, sending in American combat troops to fight the Viet Cong on the ground, and mobilizing the U.S. Air Force to bomb its supply lines. By 1968 a half million American soldiers and Marines were in South Vietnam, while additional Air Force units were stationed in Thailand and other bases. In February 1968 the Viet Cong launched an all-out attack on South Vietnamese forces across the country in the Tet Offensive. The ARVN (South Vietnam&#x27;s army) successfully fought off the attacks and reduced the Viet Cong to a state of ineffectiveness; thereafter, it was the army of North Vietnam that was the main opponent. However the Tet Offensive proved a public relations disaster for Johnson, as the public increasingly realized the United States was deeply involved in a war that few people understood. Republicans, such as California Governor Ronald Reagan, demanded victory or withdrawal, while on the left strident demands for immediate withdrawal escalated. Controversially, out of the 2.5 million Americans who came to serve in Vietnam (out of 27 million Americans eligible to serve in the military) 80% came from poor and working-class backgrounds.

====Antiwar movement====
Starting in 1964, the antiwar movement began. Some opposed the war on moral grounds, rooting for the peasant Vietnamese against the modernizing capitalistic Americans. Opposition was centered among the black activists of the civil rights movement, and college students at elite universities.

The Vietnam War was unprecedented for the intensity of media coverage—it has been called the first television war—as well as for the stridency of opposition to the war by the &quot;New Left&quot;.

Despite their high media profile, antiwar activists never represented more than a relative minority of the American population, and most tended to be college educated and from higher than average income brackets. Polls showed that most Americans favored carrying out the war to a victorious conclusion, although conversely, few were willing to carry out mass mobilization and expansion of the draft in the pursuit of victory. Even Republican candidates in the 1968 presidential election, including Nixon and California governor Ronald Reagan, did not call for total war and the use of nuclear weapons on North Vietnam, believing that Barry Goldwater&#x27;s hawkish stance may have cost him his bid for the White House four years earlier.

The Vietnam draft did have numerous flaws in it, especially its high reliance on lower middle class Americans while exempting college students, celebrities, athletes, and sons of Congressmen, although contrary to the claims of antiwar activists, most draftees were not impoverished white and black youths who had no other job opportunity. The average Vietnam draftee was white and from a lower middle class, blue collar background. Only a tiny handful of Ivy League graduates numbered among the 58,000 US servicemen killed or wounded in the eight years between 1965 and 1973.

The Vietnam draft in fact took fewer men than the Korean War draft and the conflict on the whole caused little disruption to most Americans&#x27; lives. Although a sizable portion of US manufacturing was tied up in supporting the war effort, imports of low-cost goods from Asian countries made up for the shortfall and there was no rationing or cutbacks of consumer goods as had occurred in the previous conflicts of the 20th century. The US economy during the late 1960s indeed was booming, with unemployment under 5% and real GDP growth averaging 6% a year.

===1968 and the divorce of the Democratic Party===
In 1968, Johnson saw his overwhelming coalition of 1964 disintegrate. Liberal and moderate Republicans returned to their party, and supported Richard Nixon for the GOP nomination. George Wallace pulled off the majority of Southern whites, for a century the core of the Solid South in the Democratic Party. Increasingly, the blacks, students, and intellectuals were fiercely opposed to Johnson&#x27;s policy. With Robert Kennedy hesitant about joining the contest, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, jumped in on an antiwar platform, building a coalition of intellectuals and college students. McCarthy was not nationally known, but came close to Johnson in the critical primary in New Hampshire, thanks to thousands of students who took off their counter-culture garb and went &quot;clean for Gene&quot; to campaign for him door-to-door. Johnson no longer commanded majority support in his party, so he took the initiative and dropped out of the race, promising to begin peace talks with the enemy.

Seizing the opportunity caused by Johnson&#x27;s departure from the race, Robert Kennedy then joined in and ran for the nomination on an antiwar platform that drew support from ethnics and blacks. Vice President Hubert Humphrey was too late to enter the primaries, but he did assemble strong support from traditional factions in the Democratic Party. Humphrey, an ardent New Dealer, supported Johnson&#x27;s war policy. The greatest outburst of rioting in national history came in April 1968 following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

Kennedy was on stage to claim victory over McCarthy in the California primary when he was assassinated; McCarthy was unable to overcome Humphrey&#x27;s support within the party elite. The Democratic national convention in Chicago was in a continuous uproar, with police confronting antiwar demonstrators in the streets and parks, and the bitter divisions of the Democratic Party revealing themselves inside the arena. Humphrey, with a coalition of state organizations, city bosses such as Mayor Richard Daley, and labor unions, won the nomination and ran against Republican Richard Nixon and independent George Wallace in the general election. Nixon appealed to what he claimed was the &quot;silent majority&quot; of moderate Americans who disliked the &quot;hippie&quot; counterculture. Nixon also promised &quot;peace with honor&quot; in ending the Vietnam War. He proposed the Nixon Doctrine to establish the strategy to turn over the fighting of the war to the Vietnamese, which he called &quot;Vietnamization.&quot; Nixon won the presidency, but the Democrats continued to control Congress. The profound splits in the Democratic Party lasted for decades.

===Transformation of gender relations===

====The Women&#x27;s Movement (1963–1982)====

A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan&#x27;s best-seller, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966, Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act as an NAACP for women.

Protests began, and the new &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement&quot; grew in size and power, gained much media attention, and, by 1968, had replaced the Civil Rights Movement as the U.S.&#x27;s main social revolution. Marches, parades, rallies, boycotts, and pickets brought out thousands, sometimes millions; Friedan&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Strike for Equality (1970) was a nationwide success. The movement was split into factions by political ideology early on, however (NOW on the left, the Women&#x27;s Equity Action League (WEAL) on the right, the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus (NWPC) in the center, and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far left).

Along with Friedan, Gloria Steinem was an important feminist leader, co-founding the NWPC, the Women&#x27;s Action Alliance, and editing the movement&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Ms.&quot; The proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, passed by Congress in 1972 and favored by about seventy percent of the American public, failed to be ratified in 1982, with only three more states needed to make it law. The nation&#x27;s conservative women, led by activist Phyllis Schlafly, defeated the ERA by arguing that it degraded the position of the housewife, and made young women susceptible to the military draft. There was also a disconnect between the older, relatively conservative Betty Friedan and the younger feminists, many of whom favored left-wing politics and radical ideas such as forced redistribution of jobs and income from men to women. Friedan&#x27;s primary interest was also in workplace and income inequality, and she was largely unmoved by the abortion and sexual rights activists, feeling in particular that abortion was an unimportant issue. In addition, the feminist movement remained dominated by relatively affluent white women. It failed to attract many African-American females, who tended to be of the opinion that they were victims of their race rather than their gender and that many of the feminists came from comfortable middle-class backgrounds who had seldom experienced serious hardship in their lives. The women&#x27;s liberation movement can be said to have effectively ended with the failure of the ERA in 1982 along with the more conservative climate of the Reagan years.

The failure of the ERA notwithstanding, many federal laws (e.g. those equalizing pay, employment, education, employment opportunities, credit, ending pregnancy discrimination, and requiring NASA, the Military Academies, and other organizations to admit women), state laws (i.e. those ending spousal abuse and marital rape), Supreme Court rulings (i.e. ruling the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to women), and state ERAs established women&#x27;s equal status under the law, and social custom and consciousness began to change, accepting women&#x27;s equality.

====Abortion====
Abortion became a highly controversial issue with the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 1973 that women have a constitutional right to choose an abortion, and that cannot be nullified by state laws. Feminists celebrated the decisions but Catholics, who had opposed abortion since the 1890s, formed a coalition with Evangelical Protestants to try to reverse the decision. The Republican party began taking anti-abortion positions as the Democrats announced in favor of choice (that is, allowing women the right to choose an abortion). The issue has been a contentious one ever since.

After 1973, over one million abortions were performed annually for the next decade; by 1977, abortion was a more common medical procedure in the US than tonsillectomies.

====The Sexual Revolution====
The counterculture movement had rapidly dismantled many existing social taboos, and there was a growing acceptance of extramarital sex, divorce, and homosexuality. Some people advocated dropping all laws against sex between consenting adults, including prostitution, and LGBT people began the struggle for gay liberation.

A series of court rulings in the 1960s had struck down most anti-pornography laws, and under pressure from homosexual activist groups, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973. In 1967, the Hays Code, a censorship guideline imposed on the motion picture industry since the 1930s, was lifted and replaced by a new film content rating system, and by the 1970s, there was a surge in sexually-explicit movies and social commentary coming from Hollywood.

Notable X-rated films that were widely screened in the early 1970s (provoking much public controversy, and in some states, legal prosecution) include &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, and &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, starring Marlon Brando, whose performance was nominated for an Academy Award. A new wave of raunchier adult magazines such as &quot;Hustler&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; arrived, making &quot;Playboy&quot; seem dull and old-fashioned.

Due in large part to the dramatic reduction in the risk of unwanted pregnancy engendered by the introduction of the Pill in 1960, not to mention the legalization of contraception nationwide by the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; in 1965, along with the steadily increasing acceptance of abortion and delayed marriages for career-minded young women influenced by second-wave feminism, or the chic rejection of the responsibilities of marriage altogether in favor of living together without raising a family, U.S. birthrates fell below replacement level starting in 1965 and remained depressed for almost 20 years; thus, children born during this period became known, at least in the popular press, as &quot;baby busters&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;baby boomers&quot; of the postwar years). Birthrates hit an all-time low during the post-OPEC recession in the mid-1970s.

As the decade drew to a close, however, there was a growing disgust among many conservative Americans over the excesses of the sexual revolution and liberalism, which would culminate in a revival of conservatism during the next decade, and a backlash against the incipient gay rights movement.

==Nixon administration==
Although generally regarded as a conservative, President Richard Nixon adopted many liberal positions, especially regarding health care, welfare spending, environmentalism and support for the arts and humanities. He maintained the high taxes and strong economic regulations of the New Deal era and he intervened aggressively in the economy. In August 1971, he took the nation off the gold standard of the Bretton Woods system and imposed (for a while) price and wage controls (Nixon Shock). During his final year in office, Nixon also proposed a national health care system.

Nixon reoriented US foreign policy away from containment and toward detente with both the Soviet Union and China, playing them against each other (→ Cold War#From confrontation to détente (1962–1979)). Nixon promoted &quot;Vietnamization,&quot; whereby the military of South Vietnam would be greatly enhanced so that U.S. forces could withdraw. The combat troops were gone by 1971 and Nixon could announce a peace treaty (Paris Peace Accords) in January 1973. His promises to Saigon that he would intervene if North Vietnam attacked were validated in 1972, but became worthless when he resigned in August 1974.

In May 1970, the antiwar effort escalated into violence, as National Guard troops shot at student demonstrators in the Kent State shootings. The nation&#x27;s higher education system, especially the elite schools, virtually shut down.

In 1972, Nixon announced the end of mandatory military service which had been in effect since the Korean War, and the final American citizen to be conscripted received his draft notice in June 1973. The president also secured the passage of the 26th Amendment, lowering the minimum age of voting from 21 to 18.

The Nixon Administration seized on student demonstrations to mobilize a conservative majority consisting of middle-class suburbanites and working-class whites critical of radical extremists. Economics also played a role in this mobilization. As a result of the Vietnam War, and Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s failure to raise taxes to pay for it, inflation shot up and real incomes declined. Many lower middle-class whites were critical of federal programs targeted towards blacks and the poor, with one observer noting that their wages were often only “a notch or so above the welfare payments of liberal states,” and yet “they are excluded from social programs targeted at the disadvantaged.” Numerous articles published at that time focused on the feelings of discontent that existed amongst many Americans.

Although middle-income Americans benefited from Great Society initiatives that also benefited low-income Americans, such as Medicare and federal aid to education, and despite the fact that statistics indicated that blacks and the poor (with the two groups often treated as one) lived an immeasurably more painful existence than lower middle-class whites, there existed a widespread feeling that slum residents and ghetto residents were now in the driver&#x27;s seat. A poll taken by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 1969 found that a plurality of middle Americans believed that blacks had a better chance of getting adequate schooling, a decent home, and a good job. In that same poll, 85% believed that black militants were let off too easily, 84% that campus demonstrators were treated too leniently, and 79% that most people receiving welfare could help themselves. Analysts traced sentiments such as these to the economic insecurity of those dubbed the “middle Americans”, those earning between $5,000 and $15,000 a year and including many white ethnics, who were 55% of the American population. Most of these middle Americans were blue-collar workers, white-collar employees, school teachers, and lower-echelon bureaucrats. Although not poor, according to William H. Chafe they suffered from many of the tensions of marginal prosperity, such as indebtedness, inflation, and the fear of losing what they had worked so hard to attain. From 1956 to 1966, income had increased by 86%, while the cost of borrowing had gone up even more, by 113.% Many families were hard pressed to hold on to their “middle-class” status, particularly at a time when rising inflation brought an end to increases in real income. Struggling to get by, many middle Americans viewed antipoverty expenditures and black demands as representing a threat to their own well-being.

Irregular employment was also a problem, with 20% of workers in 1969 unemployed for some period of time, a figure that rose to 23% in 1970. Many people also had little or no savings by the end of the Sixties, with a fifth of the population in 1969 having no liquid assets, and nearly half the population having less than $500.

By the end of 1967, as noted by William H. Chafe,

‘the shrill attacks on “establishment” values from the left were matched by an equally vociferous defense of traditional values by those who were proud of all their society had achieved. If feminists, blacks, antiwar demonstrators, and advocates for the poor attacked the status quo with uncompromising vehemence, millions of other Americans rallied around the flag and made clear their intent to uphold the lifestyle and values to which they had devoted their lives. Significantly, pollsters Richard Scammon and Ben Watterburg pointed out, the protesters still represented only a small minority of the country. The great majority of Americans were “unyoung, unpoor, and unblack; they [are] middle-aged, middle class, and middle minded.” It was not a scenario from which dissidents could take much comfort.’

Riding on high approval ratings, Nixon was re-elected in 1972, defeating the liberal, anti-war George McGovern in a landslide with all states except Massachusetts. At the same time, Nixon became a lightning rod for much public hostility regarding the war in Vietnam. The morality of conflict continued to be an issue, and incidents such as the My Lai Massacre further eroded support for the war and increased efforts of Vietnamization.

The growing Watergate scandal was a major disaster for Nixon, eroding his political support in public opinion and in Washington. However he did manage to secure large-scale funding for South Vietnam, much of which was wasted. The United States withdrew its troops from Vietnam before the Paris Peace Accords in 1973. However, Watergate resulted in significant Democrat gains in the 1974 midterm elections and when the new 94th Congress convened the following January, it immediately voted to terminate all aid to South Vietnam in addition to passing a bill forbidding all further US military intervention in Southeast Asia. President Ford was against this, but as Congress had a veto-proof majority, he was forced to accept. South Vietnam rapidly collapsed as the North invaded it in force, and Saigon fell to the NVA on April 30, 1975. Later nearly one million Vietnamese managed to flee to the U.S. as refugees. The impact on the U.S. was muted, with few political recriminations, but it did leave a &quot;Vietnam Syndrome&quot; that cautioned against further military interventions anywhere else. Nixon (and his next two successors Ford and Carter) had dropped the containment policy and were not willing to intervene anywhere.

===&quot;Stagflation&quot;===

At the same time that President Johnson persuaded Congress to accept a tax cut in 1964, he was rapidly increasing spending for both domestic programs and for the war in Vietnam. The result was a major expansion of the money supply, resting largely on government deficits, which pushed prices rapidly upward. However, inflation also rested on the nation&#x27;s steadily declining supremacy in international trade and, moreover, the decline in the global economic, geopolitical, commercial, technological, and cultural preponderance of the United States since the end of World War II. After 1945, the U.S. enjoyed easy access to raw materials and substantial markets for its goods abroad; the U.S. was responsible for around a third of the world&#x27;s industrial output because of the devastation of postwar Europe. By the 1960s, not only were the industrialized nations now competing for increasingly scarce raw commodities, but Third World suppliers were increasingly demanding higher prices. The automobile, steel, and electronics industries were also beginning to face stiff competition in the U.S. domestic market by foreign producers who had more modern factories and higher-quality products.

Inflation had been an extremely gentle 3% a year from 1949 to 1969, but as the 70s unfolded, this began to change and the cost of energy and consumer products began to steadily climb. In addition to the increased manufacturing competition from Europe and Japan, the US faced other difficulties due to the general complacency that set in during the years of prosperity. Many Americans assumed the good times would last forever and there was little attempt at investing in infrastructure and modernized manufacturing outside of the defense and aerospace sectors. The boundless optimism and belief in science and progress that characterized the 1950s–60s quickly eroded and gave way to a general cynicism and distrust of technology among Americans, fueled by growing concern over the negative effects on the environment by air and water pollution from automobiles and manufacturing, especially events such as the Cuyahoga River Fire in Cleveland, Ohio in 1969 and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979. 
Nixon promised to tackle sluggish growth and inflation, known as &quot;stagflation&quot;, through higher taxes and lower spending; this met stiff resistance in Congress. As a result, Nixon changed course and opted to control the currency; his appointees to the Federal Reserve sought a contraction of the money supply through higher interest rates but to little avail; the tight money policy did little to curb inflation. The cost of living rose a cumulative 15% during Nixon&#x27;s first two years in office.

Nixon&#x27;s primary interests as president were in the world of diplomacy and foreign policy; by his own admission, domestic affairs bored him. His first Secretary of the Treasury, David M. Kennedy, was a soft-spoken Mormon businessman whom the president paid little attention to. In January 1971, Kennedy stepped down from office and was replaced by Texas governor and Lyndon Johnson confidante John Connally. By the summer of 1971, Nixon was under strong public pressure to act decisively to reverse the economic tide. On August 15, 1971, he ended the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold, which meant the demise of the Bretton Woods system, in place since World War II. As a result, the U.S. dollar fell in world markets. The devaluation helped stimulate American exports, but it also made the purchase of vital inputs, raw materials, and finished goods from abroad more expensive. Nixon was reluctant to perform this step as he became convinced that moving entirely to fiat currency would give the Soviet Union the idea that capitalism was crumbling. Also, on August 15, 1971, under the provisions of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, Nixon implemented &quot;Phase I&quot; of his economic plan: a ninety-day freeze on all wages and prices above their existing levels. In November, &quot;Phase II&quot; entailed mandatory guidelines for wage and price increases to be issued by a federal agency. Inflation subsided temporarily, but the recession continued with rising unemployment. To combat the recession, Nixon reversed course and adopted an expansionary monetary and fiscal policy. In &quot;Phase III&quot;, the strict wage and price controls were lifted. As a result, inflation resumed its upward spiral. The administration largely remained aloof; practically all press conferences and public statements by the White House dealt with foreign policy issues despite Gallup polls showing that the state of the economy was of concern to 80% of Americans. Connally stepped down as Treasury Secretary in 1973 and Secretary of Labor George Shultz took over the post.

The administration&#x27;s continued preoccupation with foreign policy matters stood in stark contrast to Gallup polls showing that the economy and cost of living was the primary concern for most Americans. Virtually all White House press conferences in 1973 dealt with Vietnam, superpower relations, and Watergate while almost totally ignoring economic issues that had a far more immediate impact on Americans&#x27; lives.

Inflationary pressures led to key shifts in economic policies. Following the Great Depression of the 1930s, recessions—periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment—were viewed as the greatest of economic threats, which could be counteracted by heavy government spending or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more. In the 1970s, major price increases, particularly for energy, created a strong fear of inflation; as a result, government leaders concentrated more on controlling inflation than on combating recession by limiting spending, resisting tax cuts, and reining in growth in the money supply. Increases in the price of meat provoked public outcry and cumulated in the 1973 meat boycott. The erratic economic programs of the Nixon administration were indicative of a broader national confusion about the prospects for future American prosperity. Nixon and his advisers had a poor understanding of the complexities of the global economy (Henry Kissinger once confessed that economics were mostly a blank spot to him) and all of them belonged to the generation that came of age during the New Deal era and believed strongly in government intervention in the economy. They preferred quick, dirty, short-term fixes to complex economy issues. These underlying problems set the stage for conservative reaction, a more aggressive foreign policy, and a retreat from welfare-based solutions for minorities and the poor that would characterize the subsequent decades.

=== Crime, riots and decay of the inner cities ===
The urban crisis of the 1960s continued to escalate in the 1970s, with major episodes of riots in many cities every summer. The postwar suburbanization boom had left America&#x27;s inner cities neglected, as middle-class whites gradually moved out. Rundown housing was increasingly filled by an underclass, with high unemployment rates and high crime rates. Drugs became the most lucrative industry in the inner-city, with well-funded, well armed gangs fighting it out for control of their market. While the major decline in manufacturing came later, some industries declined sharply, such as textiles in New England. After the turmoil of the late 1960s and the advent of the Great Society, the urban inner cities began to sharply deteriorate. Nationwide crime rates, which had been low during the period leading up to 1965, suddenly started going up in 1967 and would remain so for the next quarter-century, a vexing social problem that plagued American society. &quot;Law and Order&quot; became a conservative campaign theme, using the argument that liberalism had subsidized unrest and failed to cure it.

Although urban decay affected all major cities, New York City was hit especially hard by the loss of its traditional industries, in particular garment manufacturing. The city, which had once been the cultural, business, and industrial center of the nation, declined during the 1970s into a dystopian condition. Violent crime and drugs became a seemingly insurmountable problem in New York. Times Square became a Mecca for adult businesses, prostitutes, pimps, muggers, and rapists, and the subway system was in disrepair and dangerous to ride in. With the city facing bankruptcy in 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame requested a Federal bailout, but President Ford declined. In July 1977, a power blackout caused a rash of looting and destruction in mostly African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods. That year, Edward Koch was elected mayor with the promise of turning New York around; a process that gradually succeeded over the next 15 years.

===1973 oil crisis===
To make matters worse, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began displaying its strength; oil, fueling automobiles and homes in a country increasingly dominated by suburbs (where large homes and automobile-ownership are more common), became an economic and political tool for Third World nations to begin fighting for their concerns. Following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Arab members of OPEC announced they would no longer ship petroleum to nations supporting Israel, that is, to the United States and Western Europe. At the same time, other OPEC nations agreed to raise their prices 400%. This resulted in the 1973 world oil shock, during which U.S. motorists faced long lines at gas stations. Public and private facilities closed down to save on heating oil; and factories cut production and laid off workers. No single factor did more than the oil embargo to produce the soaring inflation of the 1970s, though this event was part of a much larger energy crisis that characterized the decade.

The U.S. government response to the embargo was quick but of limited effectiveness. A national maximum speed limit of 55 mph (88 km/h) was imposed to help reduce consumption. President Nixon named William E. Simon as &quot;Energy Czar&quot;, and in 1977, a cabinet-level Department of Energy was created, leading to the creation of the United States&#x27; Strategic Petroleum Reserve, not a new idea since the government in the 1970s still had a storage facility in the Midwest containing several million pounds of helium, a relic from the 1920s when military strategists envisioned airships as a major weapon of war. The National Energy Act of 1978 was also a response to this crisis. Rationing of gasoline became unpopular.

The U.S. &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers&#x27; first order of business after Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were enacted was to downsize existing automobile categories. By the end of the 1970s, huge 121-inch wheelbase vehicles with a 4,500 pound GVW (gross weight) were a thing of the past. Before the mass production of automatic overdrive transmissions and electronic fuel injection, the traditional front engine/rear wheel drive layout was being phased out for the more efficient and/or integrated front engine/front wheel drive, starting with compact cars. Using the Volkswagen Rabbit as the archetype, much of Detroit went to front wheel drive after 1980 in response to CAFE&#x27;s 27.5 mpg mandate. The automobile industry faced a precipitous decline during the 1970s due to climbing inflation, energy prices, and complacency during the long years of prosperity in the 50s–60s. There was a loss of interest in sports and performance cars from 1972 onward, and newly mandated safety and emissions regulations caused many American cars to become heavy and suffer from drivability problems.

Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three, began suffering a growing financial crisis starting in 1976, but President Carter declined their request for a federal bailout so long as the company&#x27;s existing management remained in place. In 1978, Lee Iacocca was hired as Chrysler president following his firing from Ford and inherited a company that was quickly teetering towards bankruptcy. Iacocca managed to convince a reluctant US Congress to approve Federal loan guarantees for the struggling auto manufacturer. Although Chrysler&#x27;s troubles were the most well-publicized, Ford was also struggling and near bankruptcy by 1980. Only the huge General Motors managed to continue with business as usual.

From 1972 to 1978, industrial productivity increased by only 1% a year (compared with an average growth rate of 3.2% from 1948 to 1955), while the standard of living in the United States fell to fifth in the world, with Denmark, West Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland surging ahead.

===&quot;Détente&quot; with USSR and China===

The central goal of the Nixon administration was to radically transform relations with America&#x27;s two chief rivals, the Soviet Union and China, by abandoning the policy of containment and adopting a policy of detente. In February 1972, Nixon made a historic, nationally televised visit to China in an effort to establish diplomatic relations with the country. Relations with China had been largely hostile since the Korean War, and the United States still maintained that the Nationalist regime in Taiwan was the legitimate government of China. However, Nixon, once a staunch supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, came to increasingly believe in the value of restoring relations with China by the late 1960s as China&#x27;s relationship with the Soviet Union had turned hostile after Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution. After Nixon&#x27;s trip to China, Nixon met Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and signed the SALT Treaty in Vienna.

===Watergate===

After a tumultuous internal battle, the Democrats nominated liberal South Dakota Senator George McGovern for president. Nixon effectively eliminated any major issue McGovern could build his platform on by ending the draft, initiating the withdrawal from Vietnam, and restoring ties with China. McGovern was ridiculed as the candidate of &quot;acid, amnesty, and abortion&quot; and on Election Day, Nixon carried every state except Massachusetts. Although, Democrats retained control of Congress.

Nixon was investigated for the instigation and cover-up of the burglary of the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate office complex In Washington. The House Judiciary Committee opened formal and public impeachment hearings against Nixon on May 9, 1974. Revelation after revelation astonished the nation, providing very strong evidence that Nixon had planned the cover-up of the burglary to protect his own reelection campaign. Rather than face impeachment by the House of Representatives and a possible conviction by the Senate, he resigned, effective August 9, 1974. His successor, Gerald R. Ford, a moderate Republican, issued a preemptive pardon of Nixon, ending the investigations of Nixon but eroding his own popularity.

==Ford administration==

Aware that he had not been elected to either the office of president or vice-president, Gerald Ford addressed the nation immediately after he took the oath of office, pledging to be &quot;President of all the people,&quot; and asking for their support and prayers, saying &quot;Our long national nightmare is over.&quot;

Ford&#x27;s administration witnessed the final collapse of South Vietnam after the Democrat-controlled Congress voted to terminate all aid to that country. Ford&#x27;s attempts to curb the growing problem of inflation met with little success, and his only solution seemed to be encouraging people to wear shirt buttons with the slogan WIN (Whip Inflation Now) on them. He also appointed a Supreme Court justice, John Paul Stevens, who retired in 2010.

During Ford&#x27;s administration, the nation also celebrated its 200th birthday on July 4, 1976, widely observed with national, state, and local celebrations. The event brought some enthusiasm to an American populace that was feeling cynical and disillusioned from Vietnam, Watergate, and economic difficulties. Ford&#x27;s pardon of Richard Nixon just before the 1974 midterm elections was not well received, and the Democrats made major gains, bringing to power a generation of young liberal activists, many of them suspicious of the military and the CIA. The Church Committee investigated numerous questionable activities performed by the CIA since the 1950s, including large-scale domestic surveillance, involuntary testing of psychotropic drugs on American citizens, and support for various unsavory Third World political figures. A massive six volume report on CIA actions over the last 20 years was released by Congress. As such, the amount of CIA domestic surveillance programs was dramatically cut from almost 5000 to 626 in 1976, and by the Reagan years, a mere 32 such programs were in operation. Most of the CIA agents responsible for these actions received no punishment and all served out their careers. Nonetheless, the murder of CIA agent Richard Welch by leftist militants in December 1975 provoked public outrage and Welch was given a hero&#x27;s funeral and buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Welch&#x27;s identity had been outed by Fifth Estate, an organization founded by writer and left-wing activist Norman Mailer, and the nature of his death merely resulted in increased public sympathy for the agency. Also by the mid-1970s, the Justice Department significantly reduced its list of subversive organizations (young hirees for government agencies in the 1970s were still being asked if they had served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the 1930s). Other restrictions barring Communist Party members and homosexuals from government jobs were lifted. The FBI&#x27;s extensive surveillance programs also became exposed to the public during the &#x27;70s. An unknown person or persons managed to steal documents from an FBI field office divulging that the bureau had since the 1960s spent $300,000 on 1000 informants to infiltrate the 2500 member Socialist Workers Party. Congress also passed an act forbidding American citizens from traveling abroad for the purpose of &quot;assassination&quot;, although exactly what this meant was not clarified, and the act was subject to being revoked by the president at any time in the interest of national security.

==Carter administration==
The Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters&#x27; minds when former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter, a Washington, D.C. outsider known for his integrity, prevailed over nationally better-known politicians in the Democratic Party presidential primaries in 1976. Faith in government was at a low ebb, and so was voter turnout. Carter became the first candidate from the Deep South to be elected president since the American Civil War. He stressed the fact that he was an outsider, not part of the Beltway political system, and that he was not a lawyer. Carter undertook various populist measures such as walking to the Capitol for his inauguration and wearing a sweater in the Oval Office to encourage energy conservation. The new president began his administration with a Democratic Congress. Democrats held a two-thirds supermajority in the House, and a filibuster-proof three-fifths supermajority in the Senate for the first time since the 89th United States Congress in 1965, and the last time until the 111th United States Congress in 2009. Carter&#x27;s major accomplishments consisted of the creation of a national energy policy and the consolidation of governmental agencies, resulting in two new cabinet departments, the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of Education. Congress successfully deregulated the trucking, airline, railway, finance, communications, and oil industries, and bolstered the social security system. In terms of representation, Carter appointed record numbers of women and minorities to significant governmental and judiciary posts, but nevertheless managed to feud with feminist leaders. Environmentalists promoted strong legislation on environmental protection, through the expansion of the National Park Service in Alaska, protecting 103 million acres of land. Carter failed to implement a national health plan or to reform the tax system, as he had promised in his campaign, and the Republicans won the House in the midterm elections.

Following the post-OPEC embargo recession in 1974–75, economic growth resumed in 1976 and continued through 1978. Despite high rates of consumer spending, inflation and interest rates continued to be a persistent problem. But after the Iranian Hostage Crisis began in the spring of 1979, the US economy sunk into a deep recession, the worst since the Great Depression.

Emphasizing the energy crisis, President Carter mandated restrictions on speed limits and the heating of buildings. In 1979, Carter gave a nationally televised address in which he blamed the nation&#x27;s troubles on the crisis of confidence among the American people. This &quot;malaise speech&quot; further damaged his reelection bid because it seemed to express a pessimistic outlook and blamed the American people for his own failed policies.

===Foreign affairs===
Carter&#x27;s term is best known for the 444-day Iranian hostage crisis, and the move away from détente with the Soviet Union to a renewed Cold War.

In foreign affairs, Carter&#x27;s accomplishments consisted of the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the creation of full diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the negotiation of the SALT II Treaty. In addition, he championed human rights throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration&#x27;s foreign policy.

Although foreign policy remained quiet during Carter&#x27;s first two years, the Soviet Union appeared to be getting stronger. It was expanding its influence into the Third World along with the help of allies such as Cuba, and the pace of Soviet military spending steadily rose. In 1979, Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan to prop up a Marxist regime there. In protest, Carter declared that the US would boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. After nine years of fighting, the Soviets were unable to suppress Afghan rebels and pulled out of the country. Soviet espionage of the US government, military, and major corporations during this period was relentless and little was done to stop it. In June 1978, Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn gave the commencement address to the graduating class of Harvard and blasted the US for its perceived failure to stand up to communist tyranny. Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s speech sent shock waves through an America which was suffering from post-Vietnam syndrome and preferred to forget that the eight years of war in Southeast Asia had happened. Moscow continued to test the limits of how much they could get away with. During the mid-1970s, the Kremlin announced that it would allow a number of Russian Jews to move to the United States, however it came out too late that most of them were criminals and the entire exercise amounted to little more than a scheme by the USSR to empty their prisons of &quot;anti-social elements&quot;. The result was a wave of organized crime in the Northeastern US, and pointless bureaucratic feuds in Washington meant that no action was taken to combat them until the 1990s. Cuba engaged in similar trickery during the 1970s by allowing political dissidents to move to the US, all of whom proved to be criminals, homosexuals, mental patients, and others who the Cubans deemed undesirables.

Meanwhile, American forces in Europe, neglected during the Vietnam War, were expected to face the increasingly powerful Warsaw Pact with 1950s-era weaponry. The US military faced a sort of psychological crisis in the aftermath of Vietnam and the ending of the draft, with low morale, racial tensions, and drug use. Entirely new methods of recruiting were attempted.

The Carter Administration saw the sudden, violent end of the 2500-year-old Iranian monarchy. After the CIA-engineered coup in 1953 restored Shah Reza Pahlavi to power, he was feted as a US ally for the next quarter century and often referred to as a &quot;champion&quot; of the free world despite running a police state, and one that had great extremes of wealth and poverty, a small, Westernized middle class in Tehran contrasting with entire provinces that lacked running water or electricity, and where traditional lifestyles continued much as they had for centuries.

Up to 1970, the US had limited weapons sales to its Middle Eastern allies (which consisted mainly of Iran and Israel) in the hopes of preventing a regional arms race. The Nixon Administration lifted those restrictions that year, and the Shah obliged by purchasing expensive new military items, including F-14 fighter jets over the protests of Defense Department officials that Iran had no military need for the aircraft and selling them risked the possibility of compromising sensitive information. Pahlavi argued that he needed the military hardware to defend against the Soviet-backed Baathist regime in neighboring Iraq, until 1975 when he signed a nonaggression pact with Baghdad, after which both countries joined in on military attacks against the Kurds, who had also been a US ally. Despite owing his livelihood to Washington, the Shah nonetheless did not hesitate to join in with fellow Middle Eastern states in conspiring to raise oil prices in 1973.

The 2500th anniversary of Iranian monarchy was celebrated in 1975 with an enormous, expensive series of events in an extremely poor country, and the growing populist backlash against the Shah would erupt a few years later. Up until 1979, the State Department took it as writ that if the Shah were ever ousted, it would come from the small, Soviet-backed Tudeh Party. Anyone who knew enough about Iranian society could have predicted the arrival of the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeni, but such individuals were few and far between in the US government and intelligence agencies.

The high point of Carter&#x27;s foreign-policy came in 1978, when he mediated the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel, ending the state of war that had existed between those two countries since 1948.

In 1979, Carter completed the process begun by Nixon of restoring ties with China. Full diplomatic relations were established on January 1 of that year despite protests from Senator Barry Goldwater and some other conservative Republicans. Unofficial relations with Taiwan were maintained. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping then visited the US in February 1979.

Carter also tried to place another cap on the arms race with a SALT II agreement in 1979, and faced the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. In 1979, Carter allowed the former Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi into the United States for medical treatment. In response Iranian militants seized the American embassy in the Iranian hostage crisis, taking 52 Americans hostage and demanding the Shah&#x27;s return to Iran for trial and execution. The hostage crisis continued for 444 days and dominated the last year of Carter&#x27;s presidency, ruining the President&#x27;s tattered reputation for competence in foreign affairs. Carter&#x27;s responses to the crisis, from a &quot;Rose Garden strategy&quot; of staying inside the White House to the failed military attempt to rescue the hostages, did not inspire confidence in the administration by the American people.

<text>The history of the United States from 1980 until 1991 includes the last year of the Jimmy Carter presidency, eight years of the Ronald Reagan administration, and the first three years of the George H. W. Bush presidency, up to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Plagued by the Iran hostage crisis, runaway inflation, and mounting domestic opposition, Carter lost the 1980 United States presidential election to Republican Reagan.

In his first term, Reagan introduced expansionary fiscal policies aimed at stimulating the American economy after a recession in 1981 and 1982, including oil deregulation policies which led to the 1980s oil glut. He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in four summit conferences, culminating with the signing of the INF Treaty. These actions accelerated the end of the Cold War, which occurred in 1989–1991, as typified by the collapse of communism both in Eastern Europe, and in the Soviet Union, and in numerous Third World clients. The economy was in recession in 1981–1983, but recovered and grew sharply after that.

The Iran–Contra affair was the most prominent scandal during this time, wherein the Reagan Administration sold weapons to Iran, and used the money for CIA aid to pro-American guerrilla Contras in left-leaning Nicaragua.

== Carter administration (1980–1981) ==

=== Changing demographics and growth of the Sun Belt ===

A widely discussed demographic phenomenon of the 1970s was the rise of the &quot;Sun Belt&quot;, a region encapsulating the Southwest, Southeast, and especially Florida and California (surpassing New York as the nation&#x27;s most populous state in 1964). By 1980, the population of the Sun Belt had risen to exceed that of the industrial regions of the Northeast and Midwest—the Rust Belt, which had steadily lost industry and had little population growth. The rise of the Sun Belt was the culmination of changes that began in American society starting in the 1950s, as cheap air travel, automobiles, the interstate system, and the growth of air conditioning all spurred a mass migration south and west. Young, working-age Americans and affluent retirees all flocked to the Sun Belt.

The rise of the Sun Belt has been producing a change in the nation&#x27;s political climate, strengthening conservatism. The boom mentality in this growing region conflicted sharply with the concerns of the Rust Belt, populated mainly by those either unable or unwilling to move elsewhere, particularly minority groups and senior citizens. The Northeast and Midwest have remained more committed to social programs and more interested in regulated growth than the wide-open, sprawling states of the South and West. Electoral trends in the regions reflect this divergence—the Northeast and Midwest have been increasingly voting for Democratic candidates in federal, state and local elections while the South and West are now the solid base for the Republican Party.

As manufacturing industry gradually moved out of its traditional centers in the Northeast and Midwest, joblessness and poverty increased. The liberal response, typified by Mayor John Lindsay of New York City was to dramatically increase welfare services and education, as well as public employment and public salaries, at a time when the tax base was shrinking. New York City barely averted bankruptcy in 1975; it was rescued using state and federal money, along with strict state control of its budget.

Meanwhile, conservatives, based in the suburbs, the rural areas, and the Sunbelt railed against what they identified as the failures of liberal social programs, as well as their enormous expenses. This was a potent theme in the 1980 presidential race and the 1994 mid-term elections, when the Republicans captured the House of Representatives after 40 years of Democratic control.

The liberal leaders of the 1960s, characteristic of the era of the Great Society and the civil rights movement, gave way to conservative urban politicians in the 1970s across the country, such as New York City&#x27;s Mayor, Ed Koch, a conservative Democrat.

===Rejection of U.S./Soviet détente===
In the 1970s, the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal inflicted diminished confidence in the presidency. International frustrations, including the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, the growth of international terrorism, and the acceleration of the arms race raised fears over the country&#x27;s ability to control international affairs. The energy crisis, high unemployment, and very high inflation and escalating interest rates made economic planning difficult and raised fundamental questions over the future of American prosperity.

American &quot;malaise&quot;, a term that caught on following Carter&#x27;s 1979 &quot;crisis of confidence&quot; speech, in the late 1970s and early 1980s was not unfounded as the nation seemed to be losing its self-confidence.

Under the rule of Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet economy was falling behind. The Soviets were decades behind in computers and high technology, and its economy was heavily dependent on lucrative oil exports. Meanwhile, détente with the Soviets collapsed as the communists made gains across the Third World. Most dramatic was the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 when North Vietnam invaded and conquered the nation; American forces were involved only to rescue American supporters. Nearly a million refugees fled; most who survived came to the U.S. Other Communist movements, backed by Moscow or Beijing, were spreading rapidly across Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The Soviet Union, guided by the Brezhnev Doctrine, invaded Afghanistan in 1979 in a move roundly denounced by the West and Muslim countries. 

Reacting to all these perceptions of American decline internationally and domestically, a group of academics, journalists, politicians, and policymakers, labeled by many as &quot;new conservatives&quot; or &quot;neoconservatives&quot;, since many of them were still Democrats, rebelled against the Democratic Party&#x27;s leftward drift on defense issues in the 1970s, especially after the nomination of George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election, and blamed liberal Democrats for the nation&#x27;s weakened geopolitical stance. Many clustered around Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, a Democrat, but they later aligned themselves with Ronald Reagan and Republicans, who promised to confront pro-Soviet Communist expansion. They were largely anti-communist Democrats and opposed to the welfare programs of the Great Society. But their main targets were the old policies of containment of communism and détente with the Soviet Union. They wanted rollback and the peaceful end of the Communist threat rather than aimless negotiations, diplomacy, and arms control.

Neoconservatives attacked the foreign policy orthodoxy of containment in the Cold War as appeasement, an allusion to the British concessions to Nazi Germany in the Munich Agreement in 1938. They regarded concessions to relatively weak enemies of the United States as appeasing &quot;evil&quot;, attacked &quot;détente&quot;, opposed most-favored nation trade status for the Soviet Union, and supported unilateral American intervention in the Third World as a means of boosting U.S. leverage over international affairs. Before Reagan&#x27;s election in November 1980, neoconservatives sought to stem the antiwar sentiments caused by the U.S. defeats in the Vietnam War and the associated massive casualties in Southeast Asia that the war induced.

During the 1970s, Jeane Kirkpatrick, a political scientist and later U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan, increasingly criticized the Democratic Party. Kirkpatrick became a convert to the ideas of the new conservatism of once liberal Democratic academics. She drew a distinction between authoritarian dictators, who she believed were capable of embracing democracy and who were, not coincidentally, allies of the United States, and Communist totalitarian dictators, who she viewed as unyielding and incapable of change.

In the late 1970s, the U.S. was gripped by the worst economy since the 1930s with American automobile and steel industries confronting serious challenges, the ongoing Iran hostage crisis, and the Soviet Union expanding globally in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere. In the 1980 Winter Olympics, the U.S. amateur Olympic hockey team defeated their professional Soviet counterparts in the Miracle on Ice, providing some symbolic sense of renewed American optimism.

===Ronald Reagan and the elections of 1980===

Conservative sentiment was growing, in part due to a disgust at the excesses of the sexual revolution and the failure of liberal policies such as the War on Poverty to deliver on their promises. President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s prospects for reelection in the U.S. presidential election of 1980 were strengthened when he easily beat back a primary challenge by liberal icon Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Against the backdrop of economic stagflation and perceived American weakness against the USSR abroad, Ronald Reagan, former governor of California, won the Republican nomination in 1980 by winning most of the primaries. After failing to reach an unprecedented deal with Ford, who wanted to be a sort of co-president, Reagan picked his chief primary rival, George H. W. Bush, as the vice-presidential nominee. During the campaign, Reagan relied on Jeane Kirkpatrick as his foreign policy adviser to identify Carter&#x27;s vulnerabilities on foreign policy.

Reagan promised to rebuild the U.S. military, which had sharply declined in strength and morale after the Vietnam War, and restore American power and prestige on the international front. He also promised an end to &quot;big government&quot; and to restore economic health by use of supply-side economics.

Supply-side economists were against the welfare state built up by the Great Society. They asserted that the woes of the U.S. economy were in large part a result of excessive taxation, which &quot;crowded out&quot; money away from private investors and thus stifled economic growth. The solution, they argued, was to cut taxes across the board, particularly in the upper income brackets, in order to encourage private investment. They also aimed to reduce government spending on welfare and social services geared toward the poorer sectors of society which had built up during the 1960s.

The public, particularly the middle class in the Sun Belt region, agreed with Reagan&#x27;s proposals, and voted for him in 1980. Critics charged that Reagan was insensitive to the plight of the poor, and that the economic troubles of the 1970s were beyond any president&#x27;s ability to control or reverse.

The presidential election of 1980 was a key turning point in American politics. It signaled the new electoral power of the suburbs and the Sun Belt, with the Religious Right for the first time a major factor. Moreover, it was a watershed ushering out the commitment to government anti-poverty programs and affirmative action characteristic of the Great Society. It also signaled a commitment to a hawkish foreign policy.

A third-party candidacy by Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois, a moderate Republican, did poorly. The major issues of the campaign were the economic stagflation, threats to national security, the Iranian hostage crisis, and the general malaise that seemed to indicate America&#x27;s great days were over. Carter seemed unable to control inflation and had failed in his rescue effort of the hostages in Tehran. Carter dropped his détente-oriented advisers and moved sharply to the right against the Soviets, but Reagan said it was too little, too late.

Reagan won a landslide victory with 489 votes in the electoral college to Carter&#x27;s 49. Republicans defeated twelve Democratic senators to regain control of the Senate for the first time in 25 years. Reagan received 43,904,153 votes in the election (50.7% of total votes cast), and Carter, 35,483,883 (41.0%). John B. Anderson won 5,720,060 (6.6%) popular votes.

==Reagan administration (1981–1989)==
After years of unstinting praise from the right, and unrelenting criticism from the left, historian David Henry finds that by 2010 a consensus had emerged among scholars that Reagan revived conservatism and turned the nation to the right by demonstrating a &quot;pragmatic conservatism&quot; that promoted ideology within the constraints imposed by the divided political system. Furthermore, says Henry, the consensus agrees that he revived faith in the presidency and American self-confidence, and contributed critically to ending the Cold War.

Reagan&#x27;s approach to the presidency was somewhat of a departure from his predecessors; he delegated a great deal of work to his subordinates, letting them handle most of the government&#x27;s day-to-day affairs. As an executive, Reagan framed broad themes and made a strong personal connection to voters. He used very strong aides especially chief of staff James Baker (Ford&#x27;s campaign manager), and Michael Deaver as deputy chief of staff, and Edwin Meese as White House counsel, as well as David Stockman at the Bureau of the Budget and his own campaign manager Bill Casey at the CIA.

On March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot in Washington by a disturbed nonpolitical man. He recovered fully, with opponents silenced in the meanwhile.

Reagan stunned the nation by appointing the first woman to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor in 1981. He promoted conservative leader William Rehnquist to Chief Justice in 1986, with arch-conservative Antonin Scalia taking Rehnquist&#x27;s slot. His fourth appointment in 1987 proved controversial, as the initial choice had to withdraw (he smoked marijuana in college), and the Senate rejected Robert Bork. Reagan finally won approval for Anthony Kennedy.

===Reaganomics and the 1981 federal budget===

Ronald Reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population. He proposed to achieve this goal by cutting taxes and reducing the size and scope of federal programs. Critics of his plan charged that the tax cuts would reduce revenues, leading to large federal deficits, which would lead in turn to higher interest rates, stifling any economic benefits. Reagan and his supporters, drawing on the theories of supply-side economics, claimed that the tax cuts would increase revenues through economic growth, allowing the federal government to balance its budget for the first time since 1969.

Reagan&#x27;s 1981 economic legislation, however, was a mixture of rival programs to satisfy all his conservative constituencies (monetarists, cold warriors, middle-class swing voters, and the affluent). Monetarists were placated by tight controls of the money supply; cold warriors, especially neoconservatives like Kirkpatrick, won large increases in the defense budget; wealthy taxpayers won sweeping three-year tax rate reductions on both individual (marginal rates would eventually come down to 50% from 70%) and corporate taxes; and the middle class saw that its pensions and entitlements would not be targeted. Reagan declared spending cuts for the Social Security budget, which accounted for almost half of government spending, off limits due to fears over an electoral backlash, but the administration was hard pressed to explain how his program of sweeping tax cuts and large defense spending would not increase the deficit.

Budget Director David Stockman raced to put Reagan&#x27;s program through Congress within the administration&#x27;s deadline of forty days. Stockman had no doubt that spending cuts were needed, and slashed expenditures across the board (with the exception of defense expenditures) by some $40 billion; and when figures did not add up, he resorted to the &quot;magic asterisk&quot;—which signified &quot;future savings to be identified&quot;. He would later say that the program was rushed through too quickly and not given enough thought. Appeals from constituencies threatened by the loss of social services were ineffectual; the budget cuts passed through the Congress with relative ease.

===The recession of 1982===


By early 1982, Reagan&#x27;s economic program was beset with difficulties as the recession that had begun in 1979 continued. In the short term, the effect of Reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit. Government borrowing, along with the tightening of the money supply, resulted in sky high interest rates (briefly hovering around 20 percent) and a serious recession with 10-percent unemployment in 1982. Some regions of the &quot;Rust Belt&quot; (the industrial Midwest and Northeast) descended into virtual depression conditions as steel mills and other industries closed. Many family farms in the Midwest and elsewhere were ruined by high interest rates and sold off to large agribusinesses.

Reagan allowed the Federal Reserve to drastically reduce the money supply to cure inflation, but it resulted in the recession deepening temporarily. His approval ratings plummeted in the worst months of the recession of 1982. Democrats swept the mid-term elections, making up for their losses in the previous election cycle. At the time, critics often accused Reagan of being out of touch. His Budget Director David Stockman, an ardent fiscal conservative, wrote, &quot;I knew the Reagan Revolution was impossible—it was a metaphor with no anchor in political and economic reality.&quot;
Unemployment reached a peak of 11% in late 1982, after which recovery began. A factor in the recovery from the worst periods of 1982–83 was the radical drop in oil prices due to increased production levels of the mid-1980s, which ended inflationary pressures on fuel prices. The virtual collapse of the OPEC cartel enabled the administration to alter its tight money policies, to the consternation of conservative monetarist economists, who began pressing for a reduction of interest rates and an expansion of the money supply, in effect subordinating concern about inflation (which now seemed under control) to concern about unemployment and declining investment.

By the middle of 1983, unemployment fell from 11 percent in 1982 to 8.2 percent. GDP growth was 3.3 percent, the highest since the mid-1970s. Inflation was below 5 percent. When the economy recovered, Ronald Reagan declared it was Morning in America. Housing starts boomed, the automobile industry recovered its vitality, and consumer spending achieved new heights. Blue-collar workers were, however, mostly left behind in the economic boom years of the Reagan Administration, and the old factory jobs that had once offered high wages to even unskilled workers no longer existed.

Reagan went on to defeat Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential election by a massive 49 out of 50 state landslide.

===Rising deficits===
Following the economic recovery that began in 1983, the medium-term fiscal effect of Reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit as spending continually exceeded revenue due to tax cuts and increased defense spending. Military budgets rose while tax revenues, despite having increased as compared to the stagnant late 1970s and early 1980s, failed to make up for the spiraling cost.

The 1981 tax cuts, some of the largest in U.S. history, also eroded the revenue base of the federal government in the short-term. The massive increase in military spending (about $1.6 trillion over five years) far exceeded cuts in social spending, despite wrenching impact of such cuts spending geared toward some of the poorest segments of society. Even so, by the end of 1985, funding for domestic programs had been cut nearly as far as Congress could tolerate.

In this context, the deficit rose from $60 billion in 1980 to a peak of $220 billion in 1986 (well over 5% of GDP). Over this period, national debt more than doubled from $749 billion to $1.746 trillion.

Since U.S. saving rates were very low (roughly one-third of Japan&#x27;s,) the deficit was mostly covered by borrowing from abroad, turning the United States within a few years from the world&#x27;s greatest creditor nation to the world&#x27;s greatest debtor. Not only was this damaging to America&#x27;s status, it was also a profound shift in the postwar international financial system, which had relied on the export of U.S. capital. In addition, the media and entertainment industry during the 1980s glamorized the stock market and financial sector (e.g. the 1987 movie Wall Street), causing many young people to pursue careers as brokers, investors, or bankers instead of manufacturing and making it unlikely that any of the lost industrial base would be restored any time soon.

The deficits were keeping interest rates high (although lower than the 20% peak levels earlier in the administration due to a respite in the administration&#x27;s tight money policies), and threatening to push them higher. The government was thus forced to borrow so much money to pay its bills that it was driving up the price of borrowing. Although supply-siders promised increased investment as a result of top-rate and corporate tax cuts, growth and investment suffered for now in the context of high interest rates. In October 1987, a sudden and alarming stock market crash took place, but the Federal Reserve responded by increasing the money supply and averted what could have been another Great Depression.

Perhaps more alarmingly, Reagan-era deficits were keeping the U.S. dollar overvalued. With such a high demand for dollars (due in large measure to government borrowing), the dollar achieved an alarming strength against other major currencies. As the dollar soared in value, American exports became increasingly uncompetitive, with Japan as the leading beneficiary. The high value of the dollar made it difficult for foreigners to buy American goods and encouraged Americans to buy imports, coming at a high price to the industrial export sector. Steel and other heavy industries declined due to excessive demands by labor unions and outdated technology that made them unable to compete with Japanese imports. The consumer electronics industry (which had begun declining in the 1970s) was one of the worst victims of dumping and other unfair Japanese trade practices. American consumer electronics also suffered from poor quality and a relative lack of technical innovation compared to Japanese electronics, in part because the Cold War had caused most American scientific and engineering effort to go into the defense sector rather than the consumer one. By the end of the decade, it had virtually ceased to exist. On the bright side, the upstart computer industry flourished during the 1980s.

The U.S. balance of trade grew increasingly unfavorable; the trade deficit grew from $20 billion to well over $100 billion. Thus, American industries such as automobiles and steel, faced renewed competition abroad and within the domestic market as well. The auto industry was given breathing space after the Reagan administration imposed voluntary import restraints on Japanese manufacturers (allowing them to sell a maximum of 1.3 million vehicles in the U.S. per year) and imposed a 25% tariff on all imported trucks (a lighter 3% tariff was put on passenger cars). The Japanese responded by opening assembly plants in the U.S. to get around this, and in doing so were able to say that they were providing Americans with jobs. The VIR was repealed in 1985 after auto sales were booming again, but the tariffs remain in effect to this day. With the event of CAFE regulations, small cars came to dominate in the 1980s, and much like with electronics, Japanese makes bested American ones in terms of build quality and technical sophistication.

The enormous deficits were in large measure holdovers from Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s commitment to both &quot;guns and butter&quot; (the Vietnam War and the Great Society) and the growing competition from other G7 nations after their postwar reconstruction, but it was the Reagan administration that chose to let the deficits develop.

Reagan asked Congress for a line-item veto which would allow him to lower the deficits by cutting spending that he thought was wasteful, but he did not receive it. He also called for a balanced budget amendment which would mandate that the federal government spends no more money than it takes in, which never materialized.

===Reagan and the world===

====Foreign policy: Third World====

With Reagan&#x27;s promises to restore the nation&#x27;s military strength, the 1980s saw massive increases in military spending, amounting to about $1.6 trillion over five years. A new arms race would develop as superpower relations deteriorated to a level not seen since the Kennedy administration a generation earlier.

Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy was generally considered more successful and more thoughtful and strategic than his predecessor. He favored a hawkish approach to the Cold War, especially in the Third World arena of superpower competition. In the wake of the Vietnam War, however, Americans were increasingly skeptical of bearing the economic and financial cost of large troop commitments. The administration sought to overcome this by backing the relatively cheap strategy of specially trained counterinsurgencies or &quot;low-intensity conflicts&quot; rather than large-scale campaigns like Korea and Vietnam, which were enormously costly both in money and human life.

The Arab–Israeli conflict was another impetus for military action. Israel invaded Lebanon to destroy the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). But in the wake of the 1982 Sabra and Shatila Massacre, which provoked a political crisis in Israel, U.S. forces moved into Beirut to encourage Israeli withdrawal. The Reagan administration stood by Israel&#x27;s invasion of Lebanon in mid-1982 to maintain the support of Israel on one hand, but also to quell the influence of Israel&#x27;s pro-Soviet enemy Syria in Lebanon. However, U.S. intervention in the multi-sided Lebanese civil war had disastrous consequences. On October 23, 1983, the Marine Barracks Bombing killed 241 American troops. Shortly afterward, the U.S. withdrew its remaining 1,600 soldiers.

In Operation Urgent Fury in the Caribbean nation of Grenada, the United States for the first time invaded and successfully rolled back a Communist regime. On October 19, the small island nation of Grenada had undergone a coup d&#x27;état by Bernard Coard, a staunch Marxist–Leninist seeking to strengthen the country&#x27;s existing ties with Cuba, the Soviet Union, and other Communist states. The prime minister was killed and insurgents had orders to shoot on sight. Over 1,000 Americans were on the island, mostly medical students and their families, and the government could not guarantee their security. The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the regional security association of neighboring states led by Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica officially called on the United States for protection. In a short campaign launched Oct. 25, fought primarily against armed Cuban construction workers, the U.S. military invaded and took control, and democracy was restored to Grenada.

In 1986, Reagan launched an air strike against Libya after Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi was found to have connections to the West Berlin discotheque bombing, which killed two American soldiers.

The Reagan administration also supplied funds and weapons to heavily militarily-influenced governments in El Salvador beginning in 1980 and Honduras, and to a lesser extent in Guatemala, which was ruled by right-wing military autocrat General Efraín Ríos Montt from 1982–83. It reversed ex-President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s official condemnation of the Argentine junta for human rights abuses and allowed the CIA to collaborate with Argentine intelligence in funding the Contras. 

Central America was the Reagan administration&#x27;s primary concern, especially El Salvador and Nicaragua, where the Sandinista revolution brought down U.S.-backed Anastasio Somoza Debayle&#x27;s rule in 1979. The two countries had been historically dominated by multinational corporations and wealthy landowning oligarchs while most of their population remained in poverty; as a result, predominantly Marxist revolutionary leaders had won increasing support from the peasantry in both nations.

In 1982, the CIA, with assistance from the Argentine national intelligence agency, organized and financed right-wing paramilitaries in Nicaragua, known as the Contras. The tracing of secret funds for this scheme led to the revelations of the Iran–Contra affair. In 1985, Reagan authorized the sale of arms in Iran in an unsuccessful effort to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon; he later professed ignorance that subordinates were illegally diverting the proceeds to the Contras, a matter for which Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, an aide to National Security Advisor John M. Poindexter, took much of the blame. Reagan&#x27;s approval ratings plummeted in 1986 as a result of the scandal, and many Americans began to seriously question his judgement. While the president&#x27;s popularity improved in his final two years, he never again enjoyed the level of support he had had in 1985. Democrats regained control of Congress in the 1986 midterm elections. Oliver North, meanwhile, achieved a brief celebrity status in 1987 during his testimonies before Congress.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the Reagan administration, with help from apartheid South Africa, also attempted to topple the substantially Cuban and Soviet-backed Marxist–Leninist FRELIMO and MPLA dictatorships of Mozambique and Angola, respectively, during those countries&#x27; civil wars. The administration intervened on the side of insurgent groups RENAMO in Mozambique and UNITA in Angola, supplying each group with covert military and humanitarian aid.

In Afghanistan, Reagan massively stepped up military and humanitarian aid for mujahideen fighters against the Soviet proxy government there, providing them with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan also provided the rebels with significant assistance. General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev reduced and eventually ended his country&#x27;s commitment to Afghanistan as Soviet troops there were bogged down in guerrilla war.

Reagan also expressed opposition to the Vietnamese-installed Communist regime of Heng Samrin (and later, Hun Sen) in Cambodia, which had ousted the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime after Vietnam invaded the country. The administration approved military and humanitarian aid to the republican KPNLF and royalist Funcinpec insurgents. The Reagan administration also supported continued UN recognition of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (a tripartite rebel alliance of the KPNLF, Funcinpec, and the Khmer Rouge) over the Vietnamese-backed People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea regime. Reagan also continued American support for the autocratic Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, an ardent anti-Communist. In a 1984 presidential debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters, he explained his administration&#x27;s support of Marcos by stating, &quot;I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative? It is a large communist movement&quot; , referring to active Communist guerrillas operating in the Philippines at the time. The U.S. also had significant strategic military interests in the Philippines, knowing that Marcos&#x27;s government would not tamper with agreements to maintain U.S. naval bases in the country. Marcos was later ousted in 1986 by the mostly peaceful People Power movement, led by Corazón Aquino.

Reagan was sharply critical of the United Nations, once the darling of liberals. He repudiated what he felt was its corruption, inefficiency and anti-Americanism. In 1985–1987 the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO, which had failed in its cultural missions, and began to deliberately withhold its UN dues. American policymakers considered this tactic an effective tool for asserting influence in the UN. When the UN and UNESCO mended their ways, the U.S. returned and paid its dues.

====Last stage of the Cold War====
The Reagan administration adopted a hard-line stance toward the USSR. Early in his first term, the president attacked the rival superpower as the &quot;evil empire&quot;. While it was Jimmy Carter who had officially ended the policy of &quot;détente&quot; following Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, East-West tensions in the early 1980s reached levels not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was born out of the worsening U.S.-Soviet relations of the Reagan Era. Popularly dubbed &quot;Star Wars&quot; at the time, SDI was a multibillion-dollar research project for a missile defense system that could shoot down incoming Soviet missiles and eliminate the need for mutually assured destruction.

While the Soviets had enjoyed great achievements on the international stage before Reagan entered office in 1981, such as the unification of their socialist ally, Vietnam, in 1976, and a string of socialist revolutions in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa, the country&#x27;s strengthening ties with Third World nations in the 1960s and 1970s only masked its weakness. The Soviet economy suffered severe structural problems and started suffering from an increased stagnation in the 1970s. Documents being circulated in the Kremlin in 1980, when Carter was still president, expressed the bleak view that Moscow ultimately could not win the technological or ideological battle with the US.

East-West tensions eased rapidly after the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev. After the deaths of three elderly Soviet leaders in a row since 1982, the Politburo elected Gorbachev Soviet Communist Party chief in 1985, marking the rise of a new generation of leadership. Under Gorbachev, relatively young reform-oriented technocrats rapidly consolidated power, providing new momentum for political and economic liberalization, and the impetus for cultivating warmer relations and trade with the West.

Focused on &quot;perestroika&quot;, Gorbachev struggled to boost production of consumer goods, which would be impossible given the twin burdens of the Cold War arms race on one hand, and the provision of large sums of foreign and military aid, which the socialist allies had grown to expect, on the other. Under Gorbachev, Soviet policymakers increasingly accepted Reagan administration warnings that the U.S. would make the arms race a huge burden for them. The Soviets were already spending massive amounts on defense, and developing a counterpart to SDI was far more than their economy could handle. The result in the Soviet Union was a dual approach of concessions to the United States and economic restructuring (&quot;perestroika&quot;) and democratization (&quot;glasnost&quot;) domestically, which eventually made it impossible for Gorbachev to reassert central control. Reaganite hawks have since argued that pressures stemming from increased U.S. defense spending was an additional impetus for reform.

During the Cold War, the division of the world into two rival blocs had served to legitimize a broad and diffuse alliance not only with the Western European nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) but many countries in the developing world. Starting in the late 1980s, however, the regimes of the Eastern European Warsaw Pact began to collapse in rapid succession. The &quot;fall of the Berlin Wall&quot; was seen as a symbol of the fall of the Eastern European Communist governments in 1989. U.S.-Soviet relations had greatly improved in the latter half of the decade, with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987 and the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan as well as Cuban forces from Angola. These developments undercut the rationale for providing support to such repressive governments as those in Chile and South Korea, which underwent processes of democratization with U.S. support during the same period as those of Warsaw Pact nations.

==George H. W. Bush administration (1989–1991)==

Reagan&#x27;s vice-president George H. W. Bush easily won the 1988 Republican nomination and defeated Democratic Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis by an electoral landslide in the 1988 election. The campaign was marked by numerous blunders by Dukakis, including most famously a campaign ad featuring Dukakis in an M1 Abrams tank.

===Foreign affairs===

Unlike Reagan, Bush downplayed vision and emphasized caution and careful management. His main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State James Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger, and National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft. Bush entered the White House with a long and successful portfolio in foreign affairs including ambassadorial roles to China in the United Nations, director of the CIA, and official visits to 65 foreign countries as vice president.

Momentous geopolitical events that occurred during Bush&#x27;s presidency include:
* The crushing in June 1989 of the Tiananmen Square protests in China, which was widely condemned in the United States and around the world. 
* The United States invasion of Panama in December 1989 to overthrow a local dictator.
* The signing with the USSR of the START I and START II treaties for nuclear disarmament.
* The Gulf War in 1991, in which Bush led a large coalition that defeated Iraq when it invaded Kuwait.
* Victory in the Cold War over Soviet communism.
* Revolutions of 1989 and the collapse of Communism, especially in Eastern Europe
* German reunification in 1990, with the democratic West absorbing the ex-Communist East.
* The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, replaced by a friendly Russia and 14 other countries.
Except for Tiananmen Square in China, all the events strongly favored the United States. Bush took the initiative in the invasion of Panama and the START treaties. Otherwise, he was mostly a passive observer trying not to interfere or gloat about the events. Given the favorable outcomes, scholars generally give Bush high marks in foreign policy, except for his unwillingness to condemn the Tiananmen Square crackdown. He thought long-term favorable relations with China were too important to jeopardize. In terms of gaining public support, Bush never tried to mobilize much popular support for his foreign policy, and in domestic affairs his support was steadily slipping.

===After the Cold War===
Bush argued for the emergence of &quot;a new world order... freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.&quot;

Nationalist agitation in the Baltic States for independence led to first Lithuania and then the other two states, Estonia and Latvia, declaring independence from the USSR . On December 26, 1991, the USSR was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts. The Cold War was over, and the vacuum left by the collapse of governments such as in Yugoslavia and Somalia revealed or reopened other animosities concealed by decades of authoritarian rule. While there was a certain reluctance among the U.S. public, and even within the government, to get involved in localized conflicts in which there was little or no direct U.S. interest at stake, these crises served as a basis for the renewal of Western alliances while communism was becoming less relevant. To this effect, President Bill Clinton would declare in his inaugural address: &quot;Today, as an old order passes, the new world is more free but less stable. Communism&#x27;s collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers. Clearly America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.&quot;

Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. has sought to revitalize Cold War institutional structures, especially NATO, as well as multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank through which it promotes economic reforms around the globe. NATO was set to expand initially to Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic and has since moved further eastward. In addition, U.S. policy placed a special emphasis on the neoliberal &quot;Washington Consensus&quot;, manifesting in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which went into effect in 1994.

The U.S. often made moves to economically sanction countries which were said to be sponsoring terrorism, engaging in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or committing serious human rights abuses. There was sometimes a consensus for these moves, such as with the U.S. and European embargoes imposed on arms sales to China after its violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, as well as for the UN Security Council&#x27;s imposition of sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. Support for other unilateral sanctions however, such as the ones levied on Iran and Cuba, were limited, leading Congress to impose measures intended to punish foreign companies which violated the terms of the U.S.&#x27;s own laws. In a 1999 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; essay, Samuel P. Huntington wrote that to reinforce its primacy in the post–Cold War world,
:the United States has, among other things, attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following: pressure other countries to adopt American values and practices regarding human rights and democracy; prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter American conventional superiority; enforce American law extra-territorially in other societies; grade countries according to their adherence to American standards on human rights, drugs, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, missile proliferation, and now religious freedom; apply sanctions against countries that do not meet American standards on these issues; promote American corporate interests under the slogans of free trade and open markets [NAFTA and GATT being the main examples of the free trade policy initiatives of the 1990s; shape World Bank and International Monetary Fund policies to serve those same corporate interests; intervene in local conflicts in which it has relatively little direct interest; ... ; promote American arms sales abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries; force out one U.N. secretary-general and dictate the appointment of his successor; expand NATO...undertake military action against Iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the regime; and categorize certain countries as &#x27;rogue states,&#x27; excluding them from global institutions...1

Max Boot, another influential contemporary commentator on U.S. policy, argues that the very ambitious goals of the U.S. in the post–Cold War period are designed:
:to instill democracy in lands that have known tyranny, in the hope that doing so will short-circuit terrorism, military aggression, and weapons proliferation...This is an ambitious undertaking, the most successful examples of which are post–World War II Germany, Italy and Japan. In those cases, the U.S. Army helped transform militaristic dictatorships into pillars of liberal democracy—one of the most significant developments of the twentieth century.&quot; 

===Economics===
Initially, Bush inherited an economy that continued the strong rally that had begun in the final months of 1982. However, the Federal Reserve continued with restrictive monetary policy, limiting economic growth in the late 1980s. When the 1990 oil price shock hit in mid-1990, consumer spending contracted and the economy entered recession. Unlike the early 1980s recession, the recession beginning in 1990 was relatively mild. Some of the hardest hit cities were in California and the Northeast, while much of the South was less affected.

<text>Richard Henry Dana Jr. (August 1, 1815 – January 6, 1882) was an American lawyer and politician from Massachusetts, a descendant of a colonial family, who gained renown as the author of the classic American memoir &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; and as an attorney who successfully represented the U.S. government before the U.S. Supreme Court during the Civil War in the Prize Cases. Both as a writer and as a lawyer, he was a champion of the downtrodden, from seamen to fugitive slaves and freedmen.

==Early life and education==
Dana was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 1, 1815 into a family that had settled in colonial America in 1640, counting Anne Bradstreet among its ancestors. His father was the poet and critic Richard Henry Dana Sr. As a boy, Dana studied in Cambridgeport under a strict schoolmaster named Samuel Barrett, alongside fellow Cambridge native and future writer James Russell Lowell. Barrett was infamous as a disciplinarian who punished his students for any infraction by flogging. He also often pulled students by their ears and, on one such occasion, nearly pulled Dana&#x27;s ear off, causing the boy&#x27;s father to protest enough that the practice was abolished.

In 1825, Dana enrolled in a private school overseen by Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom Dana later mildly praised as &quot;a very pleasant instructor&quot;, though he lacked a &quot;system or discipline enough to ensure regular and vigorous study.&quot; In July 1831, Dana enrolled at Harvard College, where in his freshman year his support of a student protest cost him a six-month suspension. In his junior year, he contracted measles, which in his case led to ophthalmia.

This worsening vision inspired him to take a sea voyage. But rather than going on a fashionable Grand Tour of Europe he decided, despite his social standing, to enlist as a merchant seaman.

On August 14, 1834, he departed Boston aboard the brig &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, captained by Frank Thompson, bound for Alta California, at that time still a part of Mexico. This voyage would bring Dana to a number of settlements in California (including Monterey, San Buenaventura, San Pedro, San Juan Capistrano, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara and San Francisco). After witnessing Thompson&#x27;s sadistic practices, including a flogging on board the ship, he vowed that he would try to help improve the lot of the common seaman. The &quot;Pilgrim&quot; collected hides for shipment to Boston, and Dana spent much of his time in California at San Diego&#x27;s Point Loma curing hides and loading them onto the ship.

Dana&#x27;s description of his time on Point Loma depicted love and concern for the Hawaiians who worked there alongside him. He may have been predisposed to feel positively toward them by a previous stay in Andover, Massachusetts, among evangelicals who had embraced Hawaiians in New England and sent the first Protestant missionaries to Hawaii.

Wishing to return home sooner, Dana was reassigned by the ship&#x27;s owners to a different ship: the &quot;Alert&quot;. Dana gives the classic account of the return trip around Cape Horn in the middle of the Antarctic winter. He describes terrifying storms and profound beauty, giving vivid descriptions of icebergs, which he calls incomparable. He found the most incredible part of the journey the weeks and weeks it took to negotiate passage against winds and storms—all the while having to race up and down the ice-covered rigging to furl and unfurl sails. At one point he had an infected tooth, and his face swelled up so that he was unable to work for several days, despite the need for all hands. He also describes the scurvy that afflicts members of the crew after the rounding of the Horn. In &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, Herman Melville wrote, &quot;But if you want the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana&#x27;s unmatchable &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;. But you can read, and so you must have read it. His chapters describing Cape Horn must have been written with an icicle.&quot;

On September 22, 1836, Dana arrived back in Massachusetts. He then enrolled at what is now Harvard Law School, then called the Dane Law School after Nathan Dane. He graduated in 1837, and was admitted to the bar in 1840.

==Career==
Dana went on to specialize in maritime law. In the October 1839 issue of a magazine, he took a local judge, one of his own instructors in law school, to task for letting off a ship&#x27;s captain and mate with a slap on the wrist for murdering the ship&#x27;s cook, beating him to death for not &quot;laying hold&quot; of a piece of equipment. The judge had sentenced the captain to ninety days in jail and the mate to thirty days.

In 1841, Dana published &quot;The Seaman&#x27;s Friend,&quot; which became a standard reference on the legal rights and responsibilities of sailors. He defended many common seamen in court.
During his voyages he had kept a diary, and in 1840 (coinciding with his admission to the bar) he published a memoir, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;. The term &quot;before the mast&quot; refers to sailors&#x27; quarters, which were located in the forecastle (the ship&#x27;s bow), officers&#x27; quarters being near the stern. His writing evinces his later sympathy for the oppressed. With the California Gold Rush later in the decade, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; would become highly sought after as one of the few sources of information on California.

Dana became a prominent abolitionist, helping to found the anti-slavery Free Soil Party in 1848 and representing the fugitive slave Anthony Burns in Boston in 1854. He was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that assisted fugitive slaves.

In 1853, Dana represented William T. G. Morton in Morton&#x27;s attempt to establish that he discovered the &quot;anaesthetic properties of ether&quot;.

In 1859, while the U.S. Senate was considering whether the United States should try to annex the Spanish possession of Cuba, Dana traveled there and visited Havana, a sugar plantation, a bullfight, and various churches, hospitals, schools, and prisons, a trip documented in his book &quot;To Cuba and Back&quot;.

During the American Civil War, Dana served as a United States Attorney, and, in the &quot;Prize Cases&quot;, successfully argued before the Supreme Court that the U.S. president had the power under the U.S. Constitution to blockade Confederate ports.

After the end of the Civil War, he resigned his office since he did not approve of President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s policy of Reconstruction, which was denounced by Radical Republicans as being too moderate in regard to blacks&#x27; civil rights and the punishment of former Confederates, and entered private practice. During 1867–1868, Dana was a member of the Massachusetts legislature and also served as a U.S. counsel in the trial of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

On August 24, 1868, Dana wrote a letter to Attorney General William Evarts arguing that the United States should abandon the prosecution because, even though there was no doubt that Davis had committed treason, a jury in Virginia would be unlikely to convict, which &quot;would be most humiliating to the Government and people of this country.&quot; A conviction, even &quot;if obtained, will settle nothing in law or natural practice not now settled, and nothing in fact not now history...&quot;

In 1868, Dana ran as an independent candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from Essex County, Massachusetts. He lost to incumbent Republican Benjamin Butler and also received fewer votes than Democrat Otis P. Lord.

In 1876, his nomination as minister to Great Britain was defeated in the Senate by political enemies William Beach Lawrence and Benjamin Butler, partly because of a lawsuit for plagiarism brought against him for a legal textbook he had edited, Henry Wheaton&#x27;s &quot;Elements of International Law&quot; (8th ed., 1866). Immediately after the book&#x27;s publication, Dana had been charged by the editor of two earlier editions, William Beach Lawrence, with infringing his copyright, and was involved in litigation that continued for thirteen years. In such minor matters as arrangement of notes and verification of citations the court found against Dana, but in the main Dana&#x27;s notes were vastly different from Lawrence&#x27;s.

In 1877, Dana was one of the counsel for the U.S. federal government, appearing before the Halifax Fisheries Commission, appointed under the Treaty of Washington (1871) to resolve outstanding issues, including fishing rights. The Commission gave an award directing the U.S. to pay $5,500,000 to the British government. Towards the end of his life he went to Europe to devote himself to the preparation of a treatise on international law, but the actual composition of this work was little more than begun when he died in Rome, January 6, 1882.

His son, Richard Henry Dana III, married Edith Longfellow, daughter of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Additional biographical information and insights into the life of Richard Henry Dana Jr. are in the &quot;Introductory Note&quot; to the Harvard Classics edition of &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, edited by Charles W. Eliot, L.L.D., and published by P.F. Collier &amp; Son in 1909. Here is an excerpt:

Richard Henry Dana, the second of that name, was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, August 1, 1815. He came of a stock that had resided there since the days of the early settlements; his grandfather, Francis Dana, had been the first American minister to Russia and later became chief justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts; his father was distinguished as a man of letters. He entered Harvard College in 1831; but near the beginning of his third year an attack of measles left his eyesight so weak that study was impossible. Tired of the tedium of a slow convalescence, he decided on a sea voyage; and choosing to go as a sailor rather than a passenger, he shipped from Boston on August 14, 1834, on the brig &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, bound for the coast of California. His experiences for the next two years form the subject of the present volume.

In the December following his return to Boston in 1836, Dana re-entered Harvard, the hero of his fellow students, graduating the following June. He next took up the study of law, at the same time teaching elocution in the College, and in 1840 he opened an office in Boston. While in law school he had written the narrative of his voyage, which he now published; and in the following year, 1841, issued &quot;The Seaman&#x27;s Friend&quot;. Both books were republished in England and brought him an immediate reputation.

After several years of practicing law, during which he dealt largely with cases involving the rights of seamen, he began to take part in politics as an active member of the Free Soil Party. The Free Soil Party was founded in 1847–48 in opposition to the extension of slavery into the western U.S. territories newly acquired from Mexico.

During the operation of the Fugitive Slave Act he served as counsel on behalf of the fugitives Shadrach Minkins, Thomas Sims, and Anthony Burns, and on one occasion suffered a serious assault as a consequence of his zeal. His prominence in these cases, along with his fame as a writer, brought him much social recognition on his visit to England in 1856. Three years later, his health gave way from overwork, and he set out on a voyage round the world, revisiting California, where he made the observations that appear in the postscript to this book. The postscript is titled, &quot;Twenty-Four Years After.&quot;

On his return, Dana was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as United States Attorney for Massachusetts. In his argument before the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Prize Cases&quot;, which upheld Lincoln&#x27;s blockade of Southern ports, he greatly increased an already brilliant legal reputation. He spoke out in favor of African-American voting, education, property, and firearms ownership, stating:

His sentiments were echoed by future U.S. President James A. Garfield in his speeches, who agreed with Dana&#x27;s message.

* A roadway in Coronado, California is named in his Honor. R.H. Dana Place looks across the entry to San Diego Bay towards where Richard Henry Dana, a young man of only 20 years, first set foot at San Diego, California in 1834. There he worked and lived in a large curing house processing hides which would be shipped to Boston and made into leather goods. It was this same view that inspired the Coronado City Council, in January 1931, to rename what was then Ada Place, as R.H. Dana Place, honoring Dana, and recognizing his accomplishments, and connection to San Diego and Coronado.

<text>Two Years Before the Mast is a memoir by the American author Richard Henry Dana Jr., published in 1840, having been written after a two-year sea voyage from Boston to California on a merchant ship starting in 1834. A film adaptation under the same name was released in 1946.

== The journey ==

===Outbound===
In the book, which takes place between 1834 and 1836, Dana gives a vivid account of &quot;the life of a common sailor at sea as it really is.&quot; He sails from Boston to South America and around Cape Horn to California. Dana&#x27;s brig was on a voyage to trade goods from the United States for the Mexican colonial Californian California missions&#x27; and ranchos&#x27; cow hides. They traded at the ports in San Diego Bay, San Pedro Bay, Santa Barbara Channel, Monterey Bay, and San Francisco Bay.
The provenance of this history is well supported by records showing the company of Sprague and James building and launching a brig named in 1825 in Medford, Massachusetts.

===California===
Dana arrived in Alta California when it was a province of Mexico, and no longer Spanish colonial &quot;Las Californias&quot;. He gives descriptions of landing at each of the ports up and down the California coast as they existed then. The ports served (south to north) Mission San Diego de Alcalá, Mission San Juan Capistrano, Pueblo de Los Angeles (and Mission San Gabriel Arcángel), Mission Santa Barbara (and Presidio of Santa Barbara), Presidio of Monterey, and Presidio of San Francisco with their very small settlements and surrounding large Mexican land grant ranchos. He also describes the coastal indigenous peoples, the Mexican &quot;Californios&quot; culture, and the immigrants&#x27; and traders&#x27; influences from other locales.

The headland bluffs near Mission San Juan Capistrano presented an obstacle to taking the cow hides to the beach for subsequent loading onto the ship. So Dana, along with others of the &quot;Pilgrim&quot;″s and later &quot;Alert&quot;″s crews, tosses the hides from the bluffs, which he compared to flying a kite without a string. Some hides get stuck part way down the cliff and Dana is lowered with ropes to retrieve them. The headlands, along with the adjacent present day city, took on Dana&#x27;s name as Dana Point.

Dana learned Spanish from the Californian Mexicans and became an interpreter for his ship. He befriended Kanaka (native people of the Sandwich Islands—Hawaiian Islands) sailors in the ports, one of whose lives Dana would save when his captain would as soon see him die. He was a witness to two floggings of &quot;Pilgrim&quot; crew members by Captain Thompson, which he believed to be undeserved and unjustified, but was powerless to do anything about them, as the captain was the law aboard ship. He spent a season on the San Diego shore preparing hides for shipment to Boston, and his journey home. Dana also makes a tellingly accurate prediction of San Francisco&#x27;s future growth and significance.

===Homebound===
Of the return trip around Cape Horn, on his new ship the &quot;Alert&quot;, but with the same Captain Thompson, in the middle of the Antarctic winter, Dana gives the classic account. He describes terrifying storms and incredible beauty, giving vivid descriptions of icebergs, which he calls incomparable. The most incredible part perhaps is the weeks and weeks it took to negotiate passage against winds and storms—all the while having to race up and down the ice-covered rigging to furl and unfurl sails. At one point he has an infected tooth, and his face swells up so that he is unable to work for several days, despite the need for all hands. Upon reaching Staten Island (known today as Isla de los Estados), they know they have nearly come around the Horn. After the Horn has been rounded he describes the scurvy that afflicts members of the crew. There is another flogging by the captain, this time of the steward, for fighting and threatening to spill blood, but Dana seems to believe it was more justified than the previous incident in California. In &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, Herman Melville wrote, &quot;But if you want the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana&#x27;s unmatchable &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;. But you can read, and so you must have read it. His chapters describing Cape Horn must have been written with an icicle.&quot;

In his Concluding Chapter, Dana discusses his thoughts on the captain&#x27;s use of corporal punishment, the possibility of laws to limit the captain&#x27;s power, contrasting with the necessity of the captain to have complete authority and control of the ship, the rights of seamen, contrasting with their general reputation as a class, and aspects of any legal recourse they might have in bringing an abusive captain to justice. He also advances his ideas of promoting more religious instruction among seamen, Sunday religious observance by captains, and the benefits to be derived by more compassionate captains and religiously disciplined seamen, in bringing the men to more willingness to obey orders, which he believed would greatly reduce the necessity and incidence of punishment.

===Afterwards===

In 1869, Dana published a new edition which removed some content from the original and added an appendix entitled &quot;Twenty-Four Years After&quot;. This appendix recounts his visit to California in 1859, after the Gold Rush, by which time the state had been totally transformed. During this trip, he revisited some of the sites mentioned in the book as well as seeing old friends, including some that had been mentioned in the book, and others he did not like, such as the company agent he had worked with, Alfred Robinson, who by this time was himself an author of a book on California. Dana expressed gratitude to Robinson for being polite to him, despite Dana not being kind to him in his book. He visited the Fremont mining operations in Mariposa County. Along with Jessie Fremont and her party, he went to Yosemite Valley. Stopping along the way at Clark&#x27;s Station in Wawona, he described Galen Clark as a gracious host.

Dana also included the subsequent personal histories of Captain Thompson and many of the officers and crew members of &quot;Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Alert&quot;.

A final note records the fate of his ship, the &quot;Alert&quot;. In 1862 during the Civil War, it was captured by the Confederate commerce raider , the crew were forced into the boats, and the ship was destroyed.

==Publication history==

Dana&#x27;s father first approached Harper and Brothers, as they were his publishers, though the Danas rejected the original offer for 10 percent in royalties after the first 1,000 sold. The manuscript, originally titled &quot;Journal&quot;, was rejected by four publishing houses after that offer from Harpers in 1839. &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; was finally published in September 1840 in two versions, without credit to Dana on the title page. Dana had asked for assistance from the poet William Cullen Bryant, whose poem &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; was praised by Dana&#x27;s father. Bryant again brought the manuscript to Harper&#x27;s, hoping they would pay $500 to its author, though they ultimately paid Dana only $250 along with 24 complimentary copies. Though the book sold 10,000 copies during its first year, Dana did not receive any royalties from sales of this edition of the book.

In 1911, Dana&#x27;s son, Richard Henry Dana III, added an introduction detailing the &quot;subsequent story and fate of the vessels, and of some of the persons with whom the reader is made acquainted.&quot;

In 1909 Harvard University president Charles W. Eliot selected &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; as Volume 23 of the Harvard Classics, a collection of notable literature.

==&quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; as literature==

&quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; was &quot;conceived as a protest and written to improve the lot of the common sailor&quot;. The literary style provides a concrete description of a seaman&#x27;s life to serve as a practical guide, and not as an adventure novel. His unpolished, laconic style achieved a literary quality, however, that influenced novelist Herman Melville, according to American essayist Wright Morris.
In the following excerpt from Dana&#x27;s diary, the entry expresses not only chronological information, but how a seaman &quot;apprehends time&quot;.

This following passage, describing Dana&#x27;s first sighting of an iceberg off Cape Horn, &quot;reminds us of Melville&quot; and &quot;other passages seem to anticipate him&quot;. (Melville, born in 1819, was exactly four years Dana&#x27;s junior, and returned from his first tour as a seaman when &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; was first published in 1840):

The following description of the English sailor, Bill Jackson, has literary similarities to Melville&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot;:

Writes Morris, &quot;Dana is something more of a poet than either he or his contemporaries were aware; and that his ignorance of this gift was a loss to him as well as to us.&quot;

==Legacy==
A film adaptation was released in 1946.

The story was adapted into comic book form by Classics Illustrated in 1941 and 1947.

In Chapter 7 of his &quot;Is Shakespeare Dead?&quot;, Mark Twain contrasts passages from Dana&#x27;s book with a passage from &quot;The Tempest&quot; to demonstrate Shakespeare&#x27;s lack of seafaring knowledge, which is then further contrasted with Shakespeare&#x27;s correct usage of legal terminology.

<doc id="278439" wikidata="Q1414461" url="?curid=278439" title="Power vacuum">
<text>In political science and political history, the term power vacuum, also known as a power void, is an analogy between a physical vacuum to the political condition &quot;when someone in a place of power, has lost control of something and no one has replaced them.&quot; The situation can occur when a government has no identifiable central power or authority, after collapse, retreat with no successor, or inability to govern due to several factors. The physical analogy suggests that in a power vacuum, other forces will tend to &quot;rush in&quot; to fill the vacuum as soon as it is created, perhaps by an armed militia or insurgents, military coup, warlord or dictator. The term is also often used in organized crime when a crime family becomes vulnerable to competition.

Hereditary or statutory order of succession or effective succession planning are orderly ways to resolve questions of succession to positions of power. When such methods are unavailable, such as in failed dictatorships or civil wars, a power vacuum arises, which prompts a power struggle entailing political competition, violence, or (usually) both. A power vacuum can also occur after a constitutional crisis in which large portions of the government resign or are removed, creating unclear succession.

== Historical examples ==
Historic examples include the aftermath of the assassination of Julius Caesar, the Time of Troubles in the Tsardom of Russia, the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the Mexican Revolution after the Porfiriato, the Russian Civil War in the aftermath of World War I, and the decrease in power of Great Britain and France in the Middle East after the Suez Crisis.

===China===
China is the first country still existing to have been united other than Egypt, and has had repeated power vacuums throughout its history. China was first unified under emperor Qin Shi Huang in 221 BCE, ushering in more than two millennia in which China was governed by one or more imperial dynasties. From the start, China has experienced power vacuums after dynasties have been toppled, usually resulting in civil wars between different factions vying to form the next dynasty or political regime. These have included but are not limited to the Warring States period (475-221 BC), Three Kingdoms (220-280 AD), the Manchu conquest of China (1618-1683 AD), and the Chinese Civil War (1927-1949 AD).

During the course of the Ming treasure voyages (1405–1433), the Chinese Ming empire was the dominant political and military force within the Indian Ocean. However, in 1433, the Chinese government withdrew their treasure fleet and thus left a large void within the Indian Ocean.

== Contemporary examples ==

In 2003, when the United States led a coalition to oust Saddam Hussein in the Iraq War, the absence of an all-out Iraqi opposition force at war with government forces meant that once the Ba&#x27;ath Party was removed, no local figures were on hand to immediately assume the now vacant administerial posts. For this reason, Paul Bremer was appointed by the United States government as the interim head of state to oversee the transition.

In other western-led interventions such as in Kosovo (1999) and Libya (2011) where the initial claim of justification in each case was a humanitarian matter, there had been active opposition fighting on the ground to oust the relevant governments (in the case of Kosovo, this meant removal of state forces from the desired territory rather than ousting the government itself). Subsequently, successor entities were immediately effective in Libya and Kosovo.

Power vacuums often occur in failed states sometimes referred to as Fragile states where the state has lost the power to prevent its citizens from forming states within states, such as in post-communist Moldova&#x27;s Transnistria. The ongoing war in Sudan is an example of a power vacuum in the aftermath of the Sudanese revolution.

<doc id="278441" wikidata="Q1191429" url="?curid=278441" title="Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)">
<text>The Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) was a department of the Government of Western Australia that was responsible for implementing the state&#x27;s conservation and environment legislation and regulations. It was formed on 1 July 2006 by the amalgamation of the Department of Environment and the Department of Conservation and Land Management.

The DEC was separated on 30 June 2013 forming the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) and the Department of Environment Regulation (DER), which both commenced operations on 1 July 2013.

On 1 July 2017 the DER amalgamated with the Department of Water and the Office of the Environmental Protection Authority, to become the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, while DPaW was merged with other agencies to form the Department of Parks and Wildlife.

==Status (at dissolution, 30 June 2013)==
The department was managing more than 285,000 km2, including more than nine per cent of WA&#x27;s land area: its national parks, marine parks, conservation parks, regional parks, state forests and timber reserves, nature reserves, roadside reserves and marine nature reserves. It provided visitor and recreation facilities at a sustainable level for many of these.

It also supported or worked closely with the following authorities:
*Environmental Protection Authority
*Conservation Commission of WA
*Keep Australia Beautiful
*Marine Parks and Reserves Authority
*Swan River Trust
*Waste Authority

The total reportable visitation to DEC-managed lands and waters during the 2012-13 financial year was 16.02 million, with visitor satisfaction levels of 88%.

4,717 people were registered volunteers with the department in 2012-13 that helped in a range of projects across the state with 564,350 hours contributed.

DEC was responsible from 2007 to 2013 for protecting and conserving the state of Western Australia&#x27;s environment; this included managing:
* State forests (1,304,442 ha)
* 99 national parks (6,246,692 ha)
* 16 conservation parks (847,578 ha)
* 13 marine parks (2,206,612 ha)
* 1 marine nature reserve (132,000 ha)
* nature reserves (10,244,167 ha)

At 30 June 2013, the total area under Department of Environment and Conservation&#x27;s care was 28,531,987 ha.

The department&#x27;s key responsibilities also included roles in managing, regulating and assessing aspects of the use of the state&#x27;s natural resources and biodiversity, including the regulation of native vegetation clearing and pollution control. The department initiated 14 environmental prosecutions during 2012–13, involving a broad range of charges including pollution, unauthorised clearing of native vegetation and illegal dumping. At 30 June 2013, eight environmental prosecutions remained before the courts. There were an additional 18 pending cases that, subject to the evidentiary standard being met, could result in prosecution or other sanction.

DEC was also responsible for the wildlife conservation project Western Shield.

The department was also in charge of wildfire prevention and suppression on its land as well as fire prevention in unallocated Crown land.

The indicative burn target for 2012–13 in the south-west forest regions was 200,000 hectares. In 2012–13, DEC achieved 23,468 hectares in the south-west forest regions, including about 6,410 hectares that were burnt for pine plantation protection.

The combination of unsuitable weather conditions, fuels remaining dry due to summer conditions extending into autumn, and enhanced requirements in prescribed burn planning and risk management as a result of the 2011 Margaret River bushfire contributed to a significant reduction of the area able to be prescribed burnt this year.

The average area of burning achieved over the past 10 years has been about 163,019 hectares per annum.

A further 6,023,884 hectares was burnt in the Kimberley, Pilbara, Goldfields, Midwest, Wheatbelt and South Coast regions. The burns were carried out on DEC-managed lands as well as on unallocated Crown lands and unmanaged reserves within these regions.

DEC staff attended and monitored 676 bushfires throughout the state in 2012–13, which burnt about 5,477,394 hectares. The causes of these fires were:
* lightning—28 per cent (above the 10-year average of about 24 per cent)
* deliberately lit or arson-caused fires—37 per cent (below the 10-year average of about 43 per cent)
* accidental fires—16 per cent
* escapes from private burns—4 per cent
* escapes from DEC burns—0 per cent
* other causes—4 per cent

<text>Baywatch is an American drama television series about lifeguards who patrol the beaches of Los Angeles County, California, and Hawaii, starring David Hasselhoff. It was created by Michael Berk, Douglas Schwartz, and Gregory J. Bonann, who produced the show throughout its 11-season run. The series focuses on both professional and personal challenges faced by the characters, portrayed by a large rotating ensemble cast that includes Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Gregory Alan Williams, Jeremy Jackson, Parker Stevenson, David Chokachi, Billy Warlock, Erika Eleniak, David Charvet, Yasmine Bleeth, and Nicole Eggert.

The show was canceled after its first season on NBC, but survived through syndication and later became the most-watched television series in the world, with a weekly audience of over 1.1 billion viewers despite consistently negative critical reviews, earning it a reputation as a pop cultural phenomenon and frequent source of allusion and parody. The show ran in its original title and format from 1989 to 1999. From 1999 to 2001, with a setting change and large cast overhaul, it was known as Baywatch: Hawaii.

It spawned a spin-off series, &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;, which aired for two seasons from 1995 to 1997, and a 2017 feature film adaptation.

==Overview==
&quot;Baywatch&quot; revolves around the work of a team of lifeguards and their interpersonal relationships, with plots usually centering on dangers related to the beach and other activities pertinent to the California (later Hawaii) beach lifestyle. Saving people from drowning is one of the most typical situations used in the show, but a range of other topics, such as earthquakes, shark attacks and serial killers, serve as plot conflicts on the show.

==Episodes==

==Cast==
&quot;Baywatch&quot; is noted for its large ensemble cast with various members &quot;rotating&quot; in-and-out of the show, similarly to many long-running soap operas. By the end of the 11 season run, not a single member of the original cast was still in the cast. David Hasselhoff appeared in the most episodes (totaling 206 including the pilot), followed by Jeremy Jackson (117), Michael Newman (109), and Pamela Anderson (77).

Following the &quot;Hawaii&quot; retool, many of the series&#x27; longtime cast members left the show. The only remaining cast members were David Hasselhoff, Brooke Burns, Michael Bergin, and Michael Newman. Following the 10th season, Hasselhoff and Newman both left the series, leaving Bergin and Burns the only remnants of the show&#x27;s original &quot;L.A. era&quot;.

==History==

===Development and production===
The idea of &quot;Baywatch&quot; came about when Gregory Bonann, the creator of the show, was on duty as a lifeguard and saved two children of an MTM studio employee named Stu Erwin. Gregory originally called the show Aquatic Corps for Emergency Service (ACES), but later changed it to &quot;Baywatch&quot;, the name of rescue boats that patrolled Santa Monica Bay. The &quot;Baywatch&quot; logo was created by Bonann&#x27;s lifeguard friend John Johnson.

Baywatch debuted on NBC in 1989, but was canceled after only one season, when it placed 73rd out of 103 shows in the seasonal ratings, and also because the production studio, GTG (a joint venture of television station owner Gannett Company and Grant Tinker) went out of business. Due to high production costs, GTG was unable to finance the series any further.

Feeling the series still had potential, David Hasselhoff, one of the principal actors, along with creators and executive producers Michael Berk, Douglas Schwartz, and Gregory J. Bonann, revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991. Hasselhoff was given the title of executive producer for his work on bringing the show back. The series was hugely successful, especially internationally.

The show led to a spin-off, &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;, and three direct-to-video films: &quot;Baywatch the Movie: Forbidden Paradise&quot;, &quot;Baywatch: White Thunder at Glacier Bay&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

The audience was 65 percent female, with its number one audience being women aged 18 to 34. Speaking in 2001, Schwartz explained that, after doing focus groups on &quot;Baywatch&quot; for about five years, they learned that the show appealed to this demographic because &quot;most of [its] lead characters were strong, independent women who were heroic, who were saving lives, who were equal to men&quot;.

In 2018, FremantleMedia International, working with Warner Bros and Illuminate, &quot;remastered&quot; &quot;Baywatch&quot; from its original 35 mm film to HDTV, and redistributed the series to broadcasters.

===Filming===
Will Rogers State Beach served as the predominant beach location for &quot;Baywatch&quot;, although some scenes were filmed at Long Beach, California, and in Malibu, California.

===Theme song===
The original NBC theme was &quot;Save Me&quot;, performed by Peter Cetera, with Bonnie Raitt on guitar and Richard Sterban, the bass singer for The Oak Ridge Boys, as one of the background vocalists. From the second season onwards after syndication the theme &quot;I&#x27;m Always Here&quot; by Jimi Jamison was used to save costs on royalties and is the most popular theme for the series. David Hasselhoff also recorded a duet with Laura Branigan which was hugely successful for being broadcast as the closing track of the &quot;Baywatch&quot; TV series. The single &quot;I Believe&quot; was originally released on CD album in 1994.

===&quot;Baywatch: Hawaii&quot;===

In 1999, with production costs rising in Los Angeles, and the syndication market shrinking, the producers sought to move the production elsewhere. They filmed a pilot and announced plans to title the show &quot;Baywatch: Down Under&quot;. However, strong local opposition from residents of Avalon Beach, New South Wales eventually led to Pittwater Council, the local government area of which Avalon was part of, to permanently ban future production. As an alternative to Australia, Hawaii offered the producers large financial incentives to move the show to the islands, instead, and in season 10, &quot;Baywatch: Hawaii&quot; was launched.

&quot;Baywatch&quot; filmed for two seasons in Hawaii, from 1999 until 2001. April Masini, a newspaper advice columnist, pitched the move to executive producer Gregory J. Bonann. The agreement mandated that addition of the subtitle, to &quot;Baywatch: Hawaii&quot;, as well as the hiring local production crew, filming on-location for at least two years, and producing 44 episodes, each at a cost of about US$870,000 (climbing up to $1.1 million), 60% of which was to be spent in Hawaii. The series was canceled due to poor ratings.

==Home media==
* Australia: On May 1, 2013, Shock Entertainment released seasons 1–9 on DVD. They also released a complete series set on November 6, 2013, which features all nine seasons of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, both seasons of &quot;Baywatch Hawaii&quot; and both seasons of &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;.
* France: The reunion film &quot;&quot; was translated to French language as &quot;Alerte à Malibu: Mariage à Hawaï&quot; and has been released.
* Finland: Seasons 1–3 have been released by Future Film.
* Germany: Seasons 1–11 have been released. These releases are presented exactly as they originally aired, albeit with German language credits (these are also available in the U.K. from Amazon as imports). The reunion film &quot;Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding&quot; was translated to German language as &quot;Baywatch: Hochzeit auf Hawaii&quot; and has been released.
* Italy: Seasons 1–2 have been released by Koch Media, season 5–6 have been released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.
* Netherlands: Season 3 has been released.
* Sweden: Seasons 1–3 have been released.
* United Kingdom: Seasons 1–6 have been released by Network. In 2017, to coincide with the release of the feature film adaptation, Network released a DVD entitled &quot;Best of Baywatch&quot; which includes the two-part episodes &quot;Nightmare Bay&quot; and &quot;River of No Return&quot;.
* United States: In June 1999, a single disc DVD was released featuring two 2-part episodes from the show&#x27;s original run (&quot;Nightmare Bay&quot; parts 1 and 2 from season 2, and &quot;River of No Return&quot; parts 1 and 2 from season 3). These episodes are absent from the U.S. box sets of their respective seasons mentioned below.

First Look Studios released the first three seasons on DVD in 2006/2007. Although the box sets are labeled &quot;Season 1&quot;, &quot;Season 2&quot;, etc., the sets actually feature episodes of the &quot;following&quot; season (i.e., the &quot;Season 1&quot; box set contains the episodes of the literal &quot;second&quot; season (1991–1992) of the show). The second and third sets were released on October 31, 2006. Each set features a disc with season 1 (NBC) episodes on it. These releases also do not contain any of the original music as it appeared when the episodes aired. They have been removed, including the opening title themes, due to copyright agreements. However, these releases have been discontinued and are now out of print.

In August 2018, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Fremantle was &quot;remastering&quot; the series in high definition. However, Baywatch had been edited on tape, not film. This meant that the existing cuts of the episodes were impossible to release in high definition, and the &quot;remasters&quot; are in fact re-creations, and not always shot-for-shot accurate. The &quot;remastered&quot; episodes also changed the aspect ratio to 16:9 widescreen, resulting in some shots having a wider field of view but other shots having a narrower one. The &quot;remastered&quot; series was released on Amazon Prime Video and Hulu in HD and Pluto TV in 2019. Due to expired licenses for much of the show&#x27;s musical soundtrack, many of the show&#x27;s episodes are either cut to remove songs, or re-scored and re-edited with new &quot;soundalike&quot; tracks. Visual Entertainment Incorporated released seasons 1–9 on DVD for the first time in the United States on May 3, 2021, with a Blu-ray release on May 21.

==In popular culture==

The show is the subject of a running gag on &quot;Friends&quot;, where Chandler and Joey would watch &quot;Baywatch&quot; together religiously, including over the phone when Joey was living in another apartment. Among other related jokes, Chandler names their pet chicken after Yasmine Bleeth (although the bird later turns out to be male) due to a long-standing crush on the actress. This was largely a joke about Chandler&#x27;s actor, Matthew Perry, who briefly dated Bleeth in 1995.

Many of the actors from the series have become closely associated with their roles in the series. David Hasselhoff has often referenced or satirized his role as Mitch Buchannon, notably in &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,&quot; in which despite distinctly playing himself, he appears in lifeguard attire similar to Mitch, runs across a beach in slow-motion, and displays superhuman swimming abilities similar to Mitch&#x27;s own feats of athleticism.

&quot;Babewatch&quot; is a satirical term sometimes used in connection with the series, which has been used by the humor magazine &quot;Mad&quot; and by television commentators. The term was also used for a series of pornographic films released between 1994 and 1999 in list of feature film series with 11 to 20 entries.

&quot;Baywatch&quot; is prominently featured in the 2006 mockumentary film &quot;Borat&quot; in which the character Borat Sagdiyev (played by Sacha Baron Cohen), a Kazakh journalist with a misconstrued understanding of American customs and pop culture, becomes obsessed with Pamela Anderson after seeing her in an episode of the series (which he believes to be a documentary) and travels to the United States in a failed attempt to court her and later attempts to abduct her. In a deleted scene, Borat creates a pilot episode of a Kazakh remake of &quot;Baywatch&quot; entitled &quot;Sexydrownwatch&quot;, which features &quot;I&#x27;m Always Here&quot; and Alexandra Paul reprising her role as Stephanie.

The red swimsuits that the actresses wore in the series have become iconic. The suits were custom-fitted for each actress; Alexandra Paul wore a suit with a higher neckline while shorter cast members wore suits with higher cut legs to give the illusion of height.

=== &quot;Baywatch&quot; running ===
&quot;Baywatch running&quot; refers to the show&#x27;s numerous scenes, particularly in the opening credits, of its cast members running across the beach in slow motion, usually wearing distinctive red lifeguard gear. The trope is closely associated with the show and often referenced directly in parodies.

===Film adaptation===

The film adaptation is a comedy, written and directed by Jeremy Garelick. Garelick&#x27;s previous successes include the rewrite of &quot;The Hangover&quot;.

In September 2012, it was announced that &quot;Reno 911!&quot; co-creator and star Robert Ben Garant would direct the film version of &quot;Baywatch&quot; for Paramount Pictures.

In October 2014, it was announced that Paramount was moving forward with its big-screen adaptation of &quot;Baywatch&quot; and has loosely attached Dwayne Johnson to the project. The studio also hired Justin Malen to rewrite and attached the comedy writing team of Sean Anders and John Morris to direct.

In July 2015, it was announced Seth Gordon would direct with Damian Shannon and Mark Swift having written the latest script with Dwayne Johnson still attached to star.

On August 10, 2015, it was announced that Zac Efron had been cast in the film. Johnson also announced that the film will be R-Rated. The report stated, &quot;The story centers on a by-the-book and very serious lifeguard (Johnson) who is forced to team up with a young rule-flouting hothead (Efron) in order to save their beach from environmental destruction at the hands of an oil tycoon.&quot; That same month, reports were saying that Kelly Brook was in contention to star in the film as C.J. Parker, with Kate Upton and Charlotte McKinney also on the shortlist, but Brook denied the rumor the following day on Instagram. Brook later confirmed that she had read the script but was still uncertain if she would appear.

On November 9, 2015, it was reported that several actresses, including Alexandra Daddario, Nina Dobrev, Ashley Benson, Alexandra Shipp, Shelley Hennig, Bianca Santos, and Denyse Tontz, were in the running for the female lead, with the possibility that some of them could join the film in different roles and other unnamed actresses could be in the running as well. On November 18, 2015, Johnson confirmed Daddario (who previously worked with Johnson on &quot;San Andreas&quot;) for the role of Summer, originally played by Eggert in the TV series, and revealed the casting of C.J. and other roles would soon be announced. On January 4, 2016, Johnson announced that actress and model Kelly Rohrbach was cast as C.J. for the film. On January 11, 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Priyanka Chopra was in talks to appear in the film in a villainous role. On February 16, 2016, Chopra and Johnson released a video to confirm her participation in the above-mentioned role. On January 20, 2016, a release date of May 19, 2017, was announced and Ilfenesh Hadera joined the cast as Stef, the love interest of Johnson&#x27;s character. On January 27, 2016, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Jon Bass was cast as Ronnie, described as funny, awkward and a skilled disco dancer who falls in love with C.J. at the beach.

The film was released in the United States on May 25, 2017, by Paramount Pictures, and grossed $177.4 million worldwide.

===Potential reboot series===
As of August 2018, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that FremantleMedia International were eyeing a reboot of the franchise. On April 14, 2023, it was announced that Fremantle are developing a reboot of the series and has held early talks with a number of broadcasters and streamers. On March 4, 2024, it was announced that Fremantle and Fox Entertainment will team up for the reboot series for Fox with Lara Olsen serving as the writer and showrunner.

===&quot;After Baywatch: Moment in the Sun&quot;===
In 2019, it was announced that &quot;Baywatch&quot; was being revived as a documentary feature film. As they explained on the &quot;Factual America&quot; podcast, filmmaker Matthew Felker lined up some of the show&#x27;s top-billed cast members to take a walk down memory lane for &quot;Baywatch: The Documentary&quot; and talk about their time on the show and the hours they spent in skimpy red suits. It was announced that the documentary now titled &quot;After Baywatch: Moment in the Sun&quot; as an ABC News Studios program will air on Hulu on August 28, 2024.

<text>Atracidae is a family of mygalomorph spiders, commonly known as Australian funnel-web spiders or atracids. It has been included as a subfamily of the Hexathelidae, but is now recognised as a separate family. All members of the family are native to Australia. Atracidae consists of three genera: &quot;Atrax&quot;, &quot;Hadronyche&quot;, and &quot;Illawarra&quot;, comprising 35 species. Some members of the family produce venom that is dangerous to humans, and bites by spiders of six of the species have caused severe injuries to victims. The bites of the Sydney funnel-web spider (&quot;Atrax robustus&quot;) and northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider (&quot;Hadronyche formidabilis&quot;) are potentially deadly, but no fatalities have occurred since the introduction of modern first-aid techniques and antivenom.

==Description==
Spiders in the family Atracidae are medium to large in size, with body lengths ranging from 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2.0 in), with one exceptional specimen reaching 8 cm (3.1 in). They have a hairless carapace covering the front part of their bodies. Some atracids have relatively long spinnerets; this is especially true of the Sydney funnel-web spider (&quot;A. robustus&quot;). Males have a large mating spur projecting from the middle of their second pair of legs.
Like other Mygalomorphae – an infraorder of spiders that includes the tropical tarantulas – these spiders have fangs that point straight down the body and do not point towards each other (cf. Araneomorphae). They have ample venom glands that lie entirely within their chelicerae. Their fangs are large and powerful, capable of penetrating fingernails and soft shoes.

Australian funnel-web spiders make their burrows in moist, cool, sheltered habitats – under rocks, in and under rotting logs, and some in rough-barked trees (occasionally meters above ground). They are commonly found in suburban rockeries and shrubberies, rarely in lawns or other open terrain. A burrow characteristically has irregular silk trip-lines radiating from the entrance. Unlike some related trapdoor spiders, they do not build lids to their burrows.

==Distribution==
The primary range of the Australian funnel-web spiders is the eastern coast of Australia, with specimens found in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland. The only Australian states or territories without members of this family are Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

==Taxonomy==
The first atracid spider to be described was &quot;Hadronyche cerberea&quot;, by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1873. Octavius Pickard-Cambridge described another atracid species, &quot;A. robustus&quot;, four years later. For a considerable time, confusion existed as to the limits of the genera &quot;Hadronyche&quot; and &quot;Atrax&quot;, not helped by the destruction of the type specimens of &quot;Hadronyche cerberea&quot; during World War II. In 1980, Robert J. Raven merged the two genera under &quot;Atrax&quot;. In 1988, Michael R. Gray separated them again, and in 2010, added a third genus, &quot;Illawarra&quot;.

The family placement of the group has varied. In 1892, Eugène Simon placed &quot;Atrax&quot; and &quot;Hadronyche&quot; in the family Dipluridae. In 1901, Henry R. Hogg considered them to be sufficiently distinctive to form a separate group, which he called &quot;Atraceae&quot; – the basis of the modern family name Atracidae. When in the 1980s, Raven elevated part of Simon&#x27;s Dipluridae to the family Hexathelidae, he included the atracine group. Molecular phylogenetic studies consistently threw doubt on the monophyly of the Hexathelidae. In 2018, the group was restored to a full family as Atracidae. The following cladogram shows the relationship found between Atracidae and related taxa. Its sister taxon is Actinopodidae.

===Genera===
, the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:

* &quot;Atrax&quot; — Australia
* &quot;Hadronyche&quot; — Australia
* &quot;Illawarra&quot; — Australia


==Medical significance==

Australian funnel-web spiders are one of the most medically significant groups of spiders in the world and are regarded by some to be the most deadly, both in terms of clinical cases and venom toxicity. Six species have caused severe injuries to human victims: the Sydney funnel-web spider (&quot;Atrax robustus&quot;), the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider (&quot;Hadronyche formidabilis&quot;), the southern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider (&quot;H. cerberea&quot;), the Blue Mountains funnel-web spider (&quot;H. versuta&quot;), the Darling Downs funnel-web spider (&quot;H. infensa&quot;), and the Port Macquarie funnel-web spider (&quot;H. macquariensis&quot;).

Examination of bite records has implicated wandering males in most, if not all, fatal Australian funnel-web spider bites to humans. Adult males, recognised by the modified terminal segment of the palp, tend to wander during the warmer months of the year, looking for receptive females for mating. They are attracted to water, hence are often found in swimming pools, into which they often fall while wandering. The spiders can survive immersion in water for several hours and can deliver a bite when removed from the water. They also show up in garages and yards in suburban Sydney. Contrary to a commonly held belief, Australian funnel-web spiders are not able to jump, although they can run quickly.

While some very venomous spiders do not always inject venom when they bite, these spiders most often do. The volume of venom delivered to large animals is often small, possibly due to the angle of the fangs, which are not horizontally opposed, and because contact is often brief before the spider is brushed off. About 10 to 25% of bites are claimed to produce significant toxicity, but the likelihood cannot be predicted and all bites should be treated as potentially life-threatening.

Bites from Sydney funnel-web spiders have caused 13 documented deaths (seven in children). In all cases where the sex of the biting spider could be determined, it was found to be the male of the species. One member of the genus &quot;Hadronyche&quot;, the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider, has also been claimed to cause fatal envenomation, but to date, this lacks the support of a specific medical report. Assays of venom from several &quot;Hadronyche&quot; species have shown it to be similar to &quot;Atrax&quot; venom.

In 2021 researchers from the University of Queensland announced that the venom from funnel-web spiders found on Fraser Island contains the molecule Hi1a that could block the cell death message after a heart attack, protecting the heart after major injury and potentially preventing or minimising muscle damage.

===Toxins===
Many different toxins are found in the venom of &quot;Atrax&quot; and &quot;Hadronyche&quot; spiders. Collectively, these spider toxins are given the name atracotoxins (ACTX), as all these spiders belong to the family Atracidae. The first toxins isolated were the δ-ACTX toxins present in the venom of both &quot;A. robustus&quot; (δ-ACTX-Ar1, formerly known as robustoxin or atracotoxin) and &quot;H. versuta&quot; (δ-ACTX-Hv1a, formerly known as versutoxin). Both of these toxins produce the same effects in monkeys as those seen in humans, suggesting that they are responsible for the physiological effects seen with crude venom.
These toxins are thought to induce spontaneous, repetitive firing and prolongation of action potentials, resulting in continuous acetylcholine neurotransmitter release from somatic and autonomic presynaptic nerve endings. This leads to slower voltage-gated sodium channel inactivation and a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of activation. This in turn inhibits neurally mediated transmitter release, resulting in a surge of endogenous acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline.

Although extremely toxic to primates, the venom appears to be fairly harmless to many other animals. These animals may be resistant to the venom&#x27;s effects due to the presence of IgG, and possibly cross-linked IgG and IgM inactivating factors in their blood plasma that bind to the toxins responsible and neutralise them.

The female&#x27;s venom was thought to be only about a sixth as potent to humans as that of the male&#x27;s. The bite of a female or juvenile may still be serious, but considerable variability occurs in venom toxicity between species, together with assumed degrees of inefficiency in the method of venom delivery.

===Symptoms===
Envenomation symptoms observed following bites by these spiders are very similar. The bite is initially very painful, due to the size of the fangs penetrating the skin. Puncture marks and local bleeding are also usually visible. If substantial envenomation occurs, symptoms generally occur within minutes and progress rapidly.

Early symptoms of systemic envenomation include goose bumps, sweating, tingling around the mouth and tongue, twitching (initially facial and intercostal), salivation, watery eyes, elevated heart rate, and elevated blood pressure. As systemic envenomation progresses, symptoms include nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath (caused by airway obstruction), agitation, confusion, writhing, grimacing, muscle spasms, pulmonary oedema (of neurogenic or hypertensive origin), metabolic acidosis, and extreme hypertension. The final stages of severe envenomation include dilation of the pupils (often fixed), uncontrolled generalised muscle twitching, unconsciousness, elevated intracranial pressure, and death. Death generally is a result of progressive hypotension or possibly elevated intracranial pressure consequent on cerebral oedema.

The onset of severe envenomation can be rapid. In one prospective study, the median time to onset of envenomation was 28 minutes, with only two cases having onset after two hours (both had pressure immobilisation bandages applied). Death may occur within a period ranging from 15 minutes (this occurred when a small child was bitten) to three days.

===Treatment===
Owing to the severity of symptoms, and the speed with which they progress, in areas where these spiders are known to live, all bites from large, black spiders should be treated as though they were caused by Australian funnel-web spiders. First-aid treatment for a suspected Australian funnel-web spider bite consists of immediately applying a pressure immobilization bandage; a technique which consists of wrapping the bitten limb with a crepe bandage, as well as applying a splint to limit movement of the limb. This technique was originally developed for snakebites, but has also been shown to be effective at slowing venom movement and preventing systemic envenomation in case of an Australian funnel-web spider bite. Some evidence suggests that periods of prolonged localisation may slowly inactivate the venom.

Further supportive care may be necessary, but the mainstay of treatment is antivenom. Venom from the male Sydney funnel-web spider (&quot;A. robustus&quot;) is used in producing the antivenom, but it appears to be effective against the venom of all species of atracids. Australian funnel-web spider antivenom has also been shown, &quot;in vitro&quot;, to reverse the effects of eastern mouse spider (&quot;Missulena bradleyi&quot;) venom.

Before the introduction of antivenom, envenomation resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The purified rabbit IgG antivenom was developed in 1981 through a team effort led by Dr. Struan Sutherland, head of immunology at the Australian Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne. The antivenom is fast-acting and highly and globally effective. Antivenom therapy has shortened the course of envenomation effects; prior to its availability, the average length of hospital treatment for severe bites was about 14 days. Today, antivenom-treated patients are commonly discharged from hospital within one to three days. No deaths are known since it became available.

<text>Morris Berg (March 2, 1902 – May 29, 1972) was an American professional baseball catcher and coach in Major League Baseball who later served as a spy for the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. He played 15 seasons in the major leagues, almost entirely for four American League teams, though he was never more than an average player and was better known for being &quot;the brainiest guy in baseball.&quot; Casey Stengel once described Berg as &quot;the strangest man ever to play baseball.&quot;

Berg was a graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, spoke several languages, and regularly read ten newspapers a day. His reputation as an intellectual was fueled by his successful appearances as a contestant on the radio quiz show &quot;Information Please&quot;, in which he answered questions about the etymology of words and names from Greek and Latin, historical events in Europe and the Far East, and ongoing international conferences.

As a spy working for the government of the United States, Berg traveled to Yugoslavia to gather intelligence on resistance groups which the U.S. government was considering supporting. He was sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the German nuclear weapons program. After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, successor to the Office of Strategic Services.

==Early life and education==
Berg was the third and youngest child of Bernard Berg, a pharmacist who emigrated from Ukraine, and his wife Rose (née Tashker), a homemaker, both Jewish, who lived in the Harlem section of New York City, a few blocks from the Polo Grounds. When Berg was three and a half, he begged his mother to let him start school.

In 1906, Bernard Berg bought a pharmacy in West Newark and the family moved there. In 1910 the Berg family moved again, to the Roseville section of Newark. Roseville offered Bernard Berg everything he wanted in a neighborhood—good schools, middle-class residents, and few Jews.

Berg began playing baseball at the age of seven for the Roseville Methodist Episcopal Church baseball team under the pseudonym &quot;Runt Wolfe&quot;. In 1918, at the age of 16, Berg graduated from Barringer High School. During his senior season, the &quot;Newark Star-Eagle&quot; selected a nine-man &quot;dream team&quot; for 1918 from the city&#x27;s best prep and public high school baseball players, and Berg was named the team&#x27;s third baseman. Barringer was the first of a series of institutions where Berg&#x27;s religion made him unusual at the time. Most of the other students were East Side Italian Catholics or Protestants from the Forest Hill neighborhood. His father had wanted an environment with few Jews.

After graduating from Barringer, Berg enrolled in New York University. He spent two semesters there and also played baseball and basketball. In 1919 he transferred to Princeton University and never again referred to having attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a B.A., &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in modern languages. He studied seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Sanskrit, studying with the philologist Harold H. Bender. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to keep him on the fringes of Princeton social life, where he never quite fit in.
During his freshman year, Berg played first base on an undefeated team. Beginning in his sophomore year, he was the starting shortstop. He was not a great hitter and was a slow baserunner, but he had a strong, accurate throwing arm and sound baseball instincts. In his senior season, he was captain of the team and had a .337 batting average, batting .611 against Princeton&#x27;s arch-rivals, Harvard and Yale. Berg and Crossan Cooper, Princeton&#x27;s second baseman, communicated plays in Latin when there was an opposing player on second base.

On June 26, 1923, Yale defeated Princeton 5–1 at Yankee Stadium to win the Big Three title. Berg had an outstanding day, getting two hits in four at bats (2–4) with a single and a double, and making several marvelous plays at shortstop. Both the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Robins (the team became known as the Brooklyn Dodgers starting in 1932) desired &quot;Jewish blood&quot; on their teams, to appeal to the large Jewish community in New York, and expressed interest in Berg. The Giants were especially interested, but they already had two shortstops, Dave &quot;Beauty&quot; Bancroft and Travis Jackson, who were future Hall of Famers. The Robins were a mediocre team, on which Berg would have a better chance to play. On June 27, 1923, Berg signed his first big league contract for $5,000 ($ today) with the Robins.

==Major league career==

===Early career (1923–1925)===
Berg&#x27;s first game with the Robins was on June 27, 1923, against the Philadelphia Phillies at the Baker Bowl. Berg came in at the start of the seventh inning, replacing Ivy Olson at shortstop, when the Robins were winning 13–4. Berg handled five chances without an error, and caught a line drive to start a game-ending double play. He got a hit in two at bats, singling up the middle against Clarence Mitchell, and scoring a run. For the season, Berg batted .187 and made 21 errors in 47 games, his only National League experience.
After the season ended, Berg took his first trip abroad, sailing from New York to Paris. He settled in the Latin Quarter in an apartment that overlooked the Sorbonne, where he enrolled in 32 different classes. In Paris he developed a habit he kept for the rest of his life: reading several newspapers daily. Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it &quot;alive&quot; and refused to let anyone else touch it. When he was finished with it, he would consider the paper &quot;dead&quot; and anybody could read it. In January 1924, instead of returning to New York and getting into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and Switzerland.

During spring training at the Robins facility in Clearwater, Florida, manager Wilbert Robinson could see that Berg&#x27;s hitting had not improved, and optioned him to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Berg did not take the demotion well and threatened to quit baseball, but by mid-April he reported to the Millers. Berg did very well once he became the Millers&#x27; regular third baseman, hitting close to .330, but in July his average plummeted and he was back on the bench. On August 19, 1924, Berg was lent to the Toledo Mud Hens, a poor team ravaged by injuries. Berg was inserted into the lineup at shortstop when Rabbit Helgeth refused to pay a $10 ($ today) fine for poor play and was suspended. Major league scout Mike González sent a telegram to the Dodgers evaluating Berg with the curt, but now famous, line, &quot;Good field, no hit.&quot; Berg finished the season with a .264 average.

By April 1925, Berg was starting to show promise as a hitter with the Reading Keystones of the International League. Because of his .311 batting average and 124 runs batted in, the Chicago White Sox exercised their option with Reading, paying $6,000 ($ today) for him, and moved Berg up to the big leagues the following year.

===Career as a catcher (1926–1934)===
The 1926 season began with Berg informing the White Sox that he would skip spring training and the first two months of the season in order to complete his first year at Columbia Law School. He did not join the White Sox until May 28. Bill Hunnefield was signed by the White Sox to take Berg&#x27;s place at shortstop, and was having a very good year, batting over .300. Berg played in only 41 games, batting .221.

Berg returned to Columbia Law School after the season to continue studying for his law degree. Despite White Sox owner Charles Comiskey offering him more money to come to spring training, Berg declined, and informed the White Sox that he would be reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.

Because he reported late, Berg spent the first three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy, and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked Lyons whom he wanted to catch, the pitcher selected Berg.

In Berg&#x27;s debut as a starting catcher, he had to worry not only about catching Lyons&#x27; knuckleball, but also about facing the Yankees&#x27; Murderers&#x27; Row lineup, which included Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Earle Combs. Lyons beat the Yankees 6–3, holding Ruth hitless. Berg made the defensive play of the game when he caught a poor throw from the outfield, spun and tagged out Joe Dugan at the plate. He caught eight more times during the final month and a half of the season.

To prepare for the 1928 season, Berg went to work at a lumber camp in New York&#x27;s Adirondack Mountains three weeks before reporting to the White Sox spring training facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The hard labor did wonders for him, and he reported to spring training on March 2, 1928, in excellent shape. By the end of the season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher. In 1928, he led all AL catchers in caught-stealing percentage (60.9), was third in the AL in double plays by a catcher, with 8, and fifth in the American League in assists by a catcher, with 52. At the plate, he batted .246 with a career-high 16 doubles.

At law school, Berg failed Evidence and did not graduate with the class of 1929, but he passed the New York State bar exam. He repeated Evidence the following year, and on February 26, 1930, received his LL.B. On April 6, during an exhibition game against the Little Rock Travelers, his spikes caught in the soil as he tried to change direction, and he tore a knee ligament. In 1929, he was second in the American League in both double plays by a catcher (12) and assists by a catcher (86), caught the third-most attempted base stealers in the league (41), and was fourth in the league in caught-stealing percentage (47.7%). He had perhaps his best season at bat, hitting .287 with 47 RBIs.

He was back in the starting lineup on May 23, 1930, but was prevented from daily play because of his knee. He played in 20 games during the whole season and finished with a .115 batting average. During the winter, he took a job with the respected Wall Street law firm Satterlee and Canfield (now Satterlee, Stephens, Burke &amp; Burke).

The Cleveland Indians picked him up on April 2, 1931, when Chicago put him on waivers, but he played in only 10 games, with 13 at-bats and only 1 hit for the entire season.
The Indians gave him his unconditional release in January 1932. With catchers hard to come by, Clark Griffith, owner of the Washington Senators, invited Berg to spring training in Biloxi, Mississippi. He made the team, playing in 75 games while not committing an error, and was second in the AL in double plays by a catcher, with 9, and in caught-stealing percentage, at 54.3%. When starting catcher Roy Spencer went down with an injury, Berg stepped in, throwing out 35 baserunners while batting .236.

===First trip to Japan===
Retired ballplayer Herb Hunter arranged for three players, Berg, Lefty O&#x27;Doul, and Ted Lyons, to go to Japan to teach baseball seminars at Japanese universities during the winter of 1932. On October 22, 1932, the group of three players began their circuit of Meiji, Waseda, Rikkyo, Todai (Tokyo Imperial), Hosei, and Keio universities, the members of the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League. When the other Americans returned to the United States after their coaching assignments were over, Berg stayed behind to explore Japan. He then went on to tour Manchuria, Shanghai, and Peking, China; Indochina, Siam, India, Egypt, and Berlin, Germany.

Despite his desire to return to Japan, Berg reported to the Senators training camp on February 26, 1933, in Biloxi. He played in 40 games during the season and batted a disappointing .185. The Senators won the pennant, but lost to the Giants in the World Series. Cliff Bolton, the Senators&#x27; starting catcher in 1933, demanded more money in 1934. When the Senators refused to pay him more, he sat out and Berg got the starting job. On April 22, Berg made an error, his first fielding mistake since 1932. He had an American League record of 117 consecutive errorless games. On July 25, the Senators gave Berg his unconditional release. He soon returned to the big leagues, however, after Cleveland Indians catcher Glenn Myatt broke his ankle on August 1. Indians manager Walter Johnson, who had managed Berg in 1932, offered Berg the reserve catching job. Berg played sporadically until Frankie Pytlak, Cleveland&#x27;s starting catcher, injured himself, and Berg became the starting catcher.

===Second trip to Japan===

Herb Hunter arranged for a group of All-Stars, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Earl Averill, Charlie Gehringer, Jimmie Foxx, and Lefty Gomez, to tour Japan playing exhibitions against a Japanese all-star team. Although Berg was a mediocre, third-string catcher, he was invited at the last minute to make the trip. Berg had contracted with Movietone News, a New York City newsreel production company, to film sights from his trip; he took a 16-mm Bell &amp; Howell movie camera and a letter from the company attesting to this. When the team arrived in Japan, Berg gave a welcome speech in Japanese; he also was invited to address the legislature.

On November 29, 1934, while the rest of the team was playing in Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Tsukiji, ostensibly to visit the daughter of American Ambassador Joseph Grew. However, when Berg arrived he immediately went to the roof of the hospital which was one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and port with his movie camera. In 1942, Berg provided American intelligence with his photos of the city in case they were of use to plan bombing raids. He never did see the ambassador&#x27;s daughter. While Berg was in Japan, the Indians notified him of his unconditional release. Berg continued to travel to the Philippines, Korea, and Moscow of the Soviet Union.

===Late career and coaching (1935–1941)===
After his return to America, Berg was picked up by the Boston Red Sox. In his five seasons with the Red Sox, Berg averaged fewer than 30 games a season.

On February 21, 1939, Berg made his first of three appearances on the radio quiz show &quot;Information, Please&quot;. Berg had a dazzling performance. Of his appearance, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis told him, &quot;Berg, in just thirty minutes you did more for baseball than I&#x27;ve done the entire time I&#x27;ve been commissioner&quot;. On his third appearance, Clifton Fadiman, the moderator, started asking Berg what the latter thought were too many personal questions. Berg did not answer any of them and never appeared on the show again. Regular show guest and sportswriter John Kieran later said, &quot;Moe was the most scholarly professional athlete (I) ever knew.&quot;

After his playing career ended, Berg worked as a Red Sox coach in 1940 and 1941. Berg punctuated his career in baseball with &quot;Pitchers and Catchers,&quot; a widely admired valedictory essay on the meaning and playing of the game, published in the September 1941 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. A 2018 profile of Berg in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the essay as &quot;still one of the most insightful works ever penned about the game.&quot;

==Post-baseball career==

===Spying for the U.S. government===
With the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, the United States was thrust into World War II. To do his part for the war effort, Berg accepted a position with Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA) on January 5, 1942. Nine days later, his father, Bernard, died. During the summer of 1942, Berg screened the footage he had shot of Tokyo Bay for intelligence officers of the United States military. (At one time it was thought his film may have helped Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle plan his famous Doolittle Raid, but the raid was conducted well before the summer, on April 18, 1942.)

From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on assignment in the Caribbean and South America. His job was to monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States. They wanted to be assigned to locations where their talents would be put to better use.

On August 2, 1943, Berg accepted a position with the Office of Strategic Services Special Operations Branch (SO) for a salary of $3,800 ($ today) a year. He was a paramilitary operations officer in the part of the OSS that developed as the present-day CIA Special Activities Division. In September, he was assigned to the OSS Secret Intelligence branch (SI), and given a spot on the OSS SI Balkans desk. In this role, based in Washington, he remotely monitored the situation in Yugoslavia. He assisted and helped prepare Slavic-Americans recruited by the OSS to go on dangerous parachute drop missions into Yugoslavia. His OSS code name was &quot;Remus&quot;.

In late 1943, Berg was assigned to Project Larson, an OSS operation set up by OSS Chief of Special Projects John Shaheen. The stated purpose of the project was to kidnap Italian rocket and missile specialists in Italy and bring them to the U.S. Another project hidden within Larson was called Project AZUSA, which had the goal of interviewing Italian physicists to learn what they knew about Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. It was similar in scope and mission to the Alsos project. 

During the mission, Berg had a heated run-in in Italy with Alsos chief Boris Pash, a controversial army officer who played a major role in the stripping of the security clearance of Robert Oppenheimer. 

From May to mid-December 1944, Berg hopped around Europe, interviewing physicists and trying to convince several to leave Europe and work in the United States. In November, news about Heisenberg giving a lecture in Zürich reached the OSS. Berg was assigned to attend the lecture, which took place on December 18, and determine &quot;if anything Heisenberg said convinced him the Germans were close to a bomb.&quot; If Berg concluded that the Germans were close, he had orders to shoot Heisenberg; Berg determined that the Germans were not close. On orders direct from President Franklin Roosevelt, Berg persuaded Antonio Ferri, who had served as the head of the supersonic research program in Italy, to relocate to the United States and take part in supersonic aircraft development here. When Berg returned with Ferri, Roosevelt commented &quot;I see that Moe Berg is still catching very well&quot;. During his time in Switzerland, Berg became close friends with physicist Paul Scherrer. Berg resigned from the OSS after the war, in January 1946.

===After World War II===
In 1951, Berg begged the CIA (which replaced the OSS) to send him to the recently founded nation of Israel. &quot;A Jew must do this&quot;, he wrote in his notebook. The CIA rejected Berg&#x27;s request. But in 1952 Berg was hired by the CIA to use his old contacts from World War II to gather information about the Soviet atomic bomb project. For the $10,000 plus expenses that Berg received, the CIA received nothing. The CIA officer who spoke with Berg when he returned from Europe said that he was &quot;flaky&quot;.

For the next 20 years, Berg had no real job. He lived off friends and relatives who put up with him because of his charisma. When they asked what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, Berg became moody and snappish after the war, and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. Samuel finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave, even having eviction papers drawn up. Berg next moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he resided for the rest of his life.

He received a handful of votes in Baseball Hall of Fame voting (four in 1958, and five in 1960). When he was criticized for &quot;wasting&quot; his intellectual talent on the sport he loved, Berg replied, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be a ballplayer than a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court&quot;.

Berg received many requests to write his memoirs, but turned them down. He almost began work on them in 1960, but he quit after the co-writer assigned to work with him confused him with Moe Howard of the Three Stooges.

==Death==
Berg died on May 29, 1972, at the age of 70, from injuries sustained in a fall at home. A nurse at the Belleville, New Jersey, hospital where he died recalled his final words as: &quot;How did the Mets do today?&quot; (They won.) By his request, his remains were cremated and spread over Mount Scopus in Jerusalem, Israel.

==Legacy==

*After the war, the OSS was disbanded. Berg was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest honor given to civilians during wartime, from President Harry S. Truman for his service. He declined to accept it without any public explanation. The citation read: 
&quot;Mr. Morris Berg, United States Civilian, rendered exceptionally meritorious service of high value to the war effort from April 1944 to January 1946. In a position of responsibility in the European Theater, he exhibited analytical abilities and a keen planning mind. He inspired both respect and constant high level of endeavor on the part of his subordinates which enabled his section to produce studies and analysis vital to the mounting of American operations.&quot;
:After his death, his sister, Ethel, requested and accepted the award on his behalf, later donating it to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

*In 1996 Berg was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. 
*In 2000 he was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals. 
*His is the only baseball card on display at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency.

<text>Pecorino is an Italian hard cheese produced from sheep&#x27;s milk. The name derives from , which means &#x27;sheep&#x27; in Italian.

==Overview==

Of the six main varieties of pecorino, all of which have protected designation of origin (PDO) status under European Union law, is probably the best known outside Italy, especially in the United States, which has been an important export market for the cheese since the 19th century. Most is produced on the island of Sardinia, though its production zone also includes Lazio and the Tuscan provinces of Grosseto and Siena. Ancient Roman authors wrote about this cheese and its production technique.

The other five mature PDO cheeses are the from Sardinia (&quot;casu berbeghinu&quot; in Sardinian language); , whose production was already attested by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot;; (or &quot;picurinu sicilianu&quot; in Sicilian) from Sicily; from Basilicata; and &quot;pecorino crotonese&quot; from province of Crotone, in Calabria. Another well-known pecorino is the one that was produced in Abruzzo, the .

All come in a variety of styles depending on how long they have been aged. The more matured cheeses, referred to as (), are harder but still crumbly in texture and have decidedly buttery and nutty flavours. The other two types, and , have a softer texture and milder cream and milk tastes.

==Tradition==

A variant from southern Italy is (), to which black peppercorns are added. Today many other additions are made, for example walnuts, rocket, or tiny pieces of white or black truffle.

In Sardinia, the larvae of the cheese fly are intentionally introduced into to produce a local delicacy called &quot;casu martzu&quot;, which means &#x27;rotten cheese&#x27;. As it is illegal, &quot;casu marzu&quot; is primarily sold through the black market.

Meals may be finished with a good , served with pears and walnuts or drizzled with strong chestnut honey. Pecorino is also often used to finish pasta dishes, and used to be the natural choice for most Italian regions from Umbria down to Sicily, rather than the more expensive Parmesan. It is still preferred today for the pasta dishes of Rome and Lazio, for example pasta dressed with , , and .

<text>When Incubus Attacks, Vol. 1 is an EP that was released on August 22, 2000, by Incubus. The title is a parody of Cable&#x27;s album title, &quot;When Animals Attack&quot;.

==Reception==
AllMusic awarded the EP three out of five stars, with their review stating, &quot;part of Incubus&#x27;s charm lies in its eclectic production touches, so it&#x27;s heartening to hear that these songs stand up quite well even when stripped of zippy electronics and gut-wrenching riffs.&quot;

<text>The Black Madonna of Częstochowa (; ), also known as Our Lady of Częstochowa () is a venerated icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary housed at the Jasna Góra Monastery in Częstochowa, Poland.

Pope Clement XI issued a Pontifical decree of canonical coronation to the image on 8 September 1717 via the Vatican Chapter. It has also merited three Pontifical golden roses.

The icon is venerated by both Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians.

==Description of the image==

The original painting (122 centimeters × 82 centimetres or 48 by 32 inches) displays a traditional composition well known in the icons of Orthodox Christianity. The Virgin Mary is shown as the &quot;Hodegetria&quot; version (meaning &quot;One Who Shows the Way&quot; or “Οδηγήτρια” in Greek). In it, Mary directs attention away from herself, gesturing with her right hand toward Jesus as the source of salvation. In turn, the child extends his right hand toward the viewer in blessing while holding a book of gospels in his left hand. The icon shows Mary in fleur-de-lis robes.

The origins of the icon and the date of its composition are still contested among scholars. One difficulty in dating the icon is due in part to its original image being painted over after being severely damaged by robbers in 1430. The wooden panel backing the painting was broken, and the image slashed. Medieval restorers unfamiliar with the encaustic method found that the paints they applied to the damaged areas &quot;simply sloughed off the image&quot;, according to the medieval chronicler Risinius. Their solution was to erase the original image and repaint it on the original panel. The original features of an Orthodox icon were softened; the nose was made more aquiline.

==History==

===Lucan tradition===
The icon of Our Lady of Częstochowa has been intimately associated with Poland for the past 600 years. Its history before it arrived in Poland is shrouded in numerous legends that trace the icon&#x27;s origin to Luke the Evangelist, who painted it on a cedar table top from the Holy Family house. The same legend holds that the painting was discovered in Jerusalem in 326 by Helena, who brought it back to Constantinople and presented it to her son, Constantine the Great.

===Arrival in Częstochowa===
The oldest documents from Jasna Góra state that the picture traveled from Constantinople via Belz. Eventually, it came into the possession of Władysław Opolczyk, Duke of Opole, and adviser to Louis of Anjou, King of Poland and Hungary. Ukrainian sources state that earlier in its history, it was brought to Belz with much ceremony and honors by King Lev I of Galicia and later taken by Władysław from the Castle of Belz when the town was incorporated into the Polish kingdom. A famous story tells that in late August 1384, Ladislaus was passing Częstochowa with the picture when his horses refused to go on. He was advised in a dream to leave the icon at Jasna Góra.

Art historians say that the original painting was a Byzantine icon created around the sixth or ninth century. They agree that Prince Władysław brought it to the monastery in the 14th century.

===Queen and Protectress of Poland===
In August 1382, the hilltop parish church was transferred to the Paulites, a hermitic order from Hungary. The golden fleur-de-lis painted on the Virgin&#x27;s blue veil parallel the heraldic &quot;azure, semée de lis, or&quot; of the French royal coat of arms and the most likely explanation for their presence is that the icon had been present in Hungary during the reign of either Charles I of Hungary or Louis the Great, the Hungarian kings of the Anjou dynasty. They probably had the fleur-de-lis of their family&#x27;s coat of arms painted on the icon. This would suggest that the image was probably originally brought to Jasna Góra by the Pauline monks from their founding monastery in Hungary.

The Black Madonna is said to have miraculously saved the monastery of Jasna Góra (English: Bright Mount) from a Swedish invasion. The Siege of Jasna Góra took place in the winter of 1655 during the Second Northern War, as the Swedish invasion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth is known. The Swedes were attempting to capture the Jasna Góra monastery in Częstochowa. The sacred icon was replaced with a copy and the original moved in secret to the castle in Lubliniec, and later to the Pauline monastery in Mochów between the towns of Prudnik and Głogówek. Seventy monks and 180 local volunteers, mostly from the Szlachta (Polish nobility), held off 4,000 Swedes for 40 days, saved their sacred icon and, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war. This event led King John II Casimir Vasa to give what has become known as the Lwów Oath. He submitted the Polish Commonwealth under the protection of Our Lady and proclaimed her Queen of Poland in the cathedral of Lwów on April 1, 1656. Before this event, several royal nobilities have offered crowns to the image throughout the years, replacing its iron sheet crown riza with one in gold with several jewels. In later years, various gemstones were interchanged and repositioned around the image to preserve the icon&#x27;s aesthetic by replacing the stolen crowns.

===Marian apparition===

The legend concerning the two scars on the Black Madonna&#x27;s right cheek is that the Hussites stormed the Pauline monastery in 1430, plundering the sanctuary. Among the items stolen was the icon. The Hussites tried to get away after putting it in their wagon, but their horses refused to move. They threw the portrait down to the ground, and one of the plunderers drew his sword upon the image and inflicted two deep strikes. When the robber tried to inflict a third strike, he fell to the ground and writhed in agony until his death. Despite past attempts to repair these scars, they had difficulty covering up those slashes as the painting was done with tempera infused with diluted wax.

===Veneration===
Częstochowa is regarded as the most popular shrine in Poland, with many Polish Catholics making a pilgrimage there every year. Since 1711, a pilgrimage leaves Warsaw every August 6 for the nine-day, 140-mile trek. Elderly pilgrims recall stealing through the dark countryside at great personal risk during the Nazi occupation. Pope John Paul II secretly visited as a student pilgrim during World War II.

The feast day of Our Lady of Częstochowa is celebrated on August 26.

==Pontifical approbations==

Several pontiffs have recognized the image:

* Pope Clement XI — issued a decree of Canonical Coronation for the image via the Vatican Chapter on 8 September 1717. It is the third image to merit a decree of pontifical coronation outside of Rome. The first one is the Madonna of Trsat in Croatia, followed by the Virgin of Mount Goritia in Slovenia. 
* Pope Pius X — after the crowns were stolen on 23 October 1909, the Pontiff replaced the crowns on 22 May 1910.
* Pope John Paul II — gifted another set of crowns as a native of Poland, placed on 26 August 2005.
* Three pontiffs have granted golden roses to the image, Pope John Paul II (1978), Pope Benedict XVI (2006), Pope Francis (2016).

==Outside Poland==
Orthodox Christian believers in Ukraine and Belarus as former parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Ukrainians have a special devotion to the Madonna of Częstochowa. The icon is often mentioned in Ukrainian folk songs from the 16th and 17th centuries.

Our Lady of Czestochowa Roman Catholic Church in Houston, Texas has a copy hanging inside the church to the left of the altar. This version of the icon does not have the heavily gilded gold over the initial image.

The American National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa is located in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Another shrine of the image is located in Garfield Heights, Ohio; erected on October 1, 1939, by the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis.

In Australia, the Shrine of Our Lady of Mercy, Penrose Park, located in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales is dedicated in her honour. The title &quot;Our Lady of Mercy&quot; is used as remembrance of times throughout history that prayers for protection have been responded to through appeal to Our Lady of Częstochowa, as adherents believe.

There is a memorial dedicated to the Madonna of Częstochowa at the Carfin Grotto, Scotland.

==Syncretism in the Religion of Vodou==
Due to its appearance, the icon has been syncretized by some Vodou practitioners to the deity Ezilí Dantor, the main loa of the Petro family in Haitian Vodou. It is hypothesized that the image was introduced into Haiti by the reproductions of the Black Madonna brought by Polish soldiers who sided with the rebels during the Haitian Revolution.

<text>William West Anderson (September 19, 1928 – June 9, 2017), known as Adam West, was an American actor. He portrayed Batman in the 1960s ABC series of the same name and its 1966 theatrical feature film, reprising the role in various media until 2017. Having made his film debut in the 1950s, West starred opposite Chuck Connors in &quot;Geronimo&quot; (1962) and The Three Stooges in &quot;The Outlaws Is Coming&quot; (1965). He also appeared in the science fiction film &quot;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&quot; (1964).

He voiced parodied versions of himself in the animated television sitcoms &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; (2003–2008), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1992, 2002), and &quot;Family Guy&quot; (2000–2017). In the last of these, he played Mayor Adam West between the second and seventeenth seasons. He received a television star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Adam West was born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928, in Walla Walla, Washington. His father, Otto Anderson (1903–1984) was a farmer descending from Scania in southern Sweden; and his mother, Audrey Volenne (née Speer; 1906–1969) was an opera singer and concert pianist who left her Hollywood dreams in order to care for her family. Following her example, as a young man West told his father that he intended to go to Hollywood after completing school. He moved to Seattle with his mother when he was 15, following his parents&#x27; divorce.

West attended Walla Walla High School during his freshman and sophomore years and later enrolled in Lakeside School in Seattle. He attended Whitman College but studied at the University of Puget Sound during the fall semester of 1949. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature and a minor in psychology from Whitman College, where he was a member of the Gamma Zeta chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He also participated on the speech and debate team. 

Drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he served as an announcer on American Forces Network television. After his discharge, he worked as a milkman before moving to Hawaii to pursue a career in television.

==Career==

===Early roles===

While in Hawaii, West was picked for a role as the sidekick on a local TV program, &quot;The Kini Popo Show&quot;, which also featured a chimp named Peaches. West later took over as host of the show. In 1959, West moved with his wife and two children to Hollywood, where he took the stage name Adam West.

He appeared in the film &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot; which starred Paul Newman. He had guest-star roles in a number of television Westerns. On three Warner Bros. Television westerns which aired on ABC—&quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, &quot;Colt .45&quot;, and &quot;Lawman&quot;—West played the role of Doc Holliday, the frontier dentist and gunfighter. West also appeared playing different characters in two episodes of &quot;Maverick&quot; opposite James Garner: &quot;Two Tickets to Ten Strike&quot; and &quot;A Fellow&#x27;s Brother&quot; in 1958. He guest starred in Warner Bros. detective series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; and &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;.

===1960s–1980s===
On January 10, 1961, West appeared as a young, ambitious deputy who foolishly confronts a gunfighter named Clay Jackson, portrayed by Jock Mahoney, in the episode &quot;The Man from Kansas&quot; of the NBC Western series &quot;Laramie&quot;. He played Christopher Rolf in the episode &quot;Stopover&quot; of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, which aired on April 25, 1961.

West made two guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in 1961 and 1962. His first role was as small-town journalist Dan Southern in &quot;The Case of the Barefaced Witness&quot;. His other role was as folk singer Pete Norland in &quot;The Case of the Bogus Books&quot;.

In 1959-1962 he became a regular on the American television series &quot;Robert Taylor&#x27;s Detectives&quot; in its third season.

He made a brief appearance in the 1963 film &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot; starring Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen, and starred as Colonel Dan McCready, the ill-fated mission commander of &quot;Mars Gravity Probe 1&quot; in the 1964 film &quot;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&quot;. That same year he was cast alongside William Shatner in the pilot for the proposed series &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, playing Cleander to Shatner&#x27;s Alexander. The series was not picked up and the pilot wasn&#x27;t broadcast until 1968 when it was repackaged as a TV film to capitalize on West and Shatner&#x27;s later fame. West was apparently unsurprised by the rejection, later noting that &quot;It turned out to be one of the worst scripts I have ever read and it was one of the worst things I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

In 1964, West played Dr. Clayton Harris, a handsome young physician, in two episodes of the sitcom &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. In the same year West starred in an episode of the ABC &quot;Outer Limits&quot; series titled &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot;. December 10, 1964, an episode of &quot;Bewitched&quot; titled “Love is Blind” was released, in which West played Kermit, an artist who marries Gertrude.

In 1965, he was cast in the comedy Western &quot;The Outlaws Is Coming&quot;, starring The Three Stooges. In the same year he starred in &quot;Mara of the Wilderness&quot; and in the Spaghetti Western &quot;The Relentless Four&quot;.

====Batman====
Producer William Dozier cast West as Batman/Bruce Wayne in the television series &quot;Batman&quot;, in part after seeing him perform as the James Bond-like spy Captain Q in a Nestlé Quik commercial. West was in competition with Lyle Waggoner for the Batman role.

The popular campy show ran on ABC from 1966 to 1968; a feature-length film version directed by Leslie H. Martinson was released in 1966.

In 1966, West released a novelty song &quot;Miranda&quot; as his Batman character.

Also in character, West appeared in a public service announcement in which he encouraged schoolchildren to heed then-President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s call for them to buy U.S. savings stamps, a children&#x27;s version of U.S. savings bonds, to support the Vietnam War.

In 1970, West was considered for the role of James Bond by producer Albert Broccoli for the film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

====Post-&quot;Batman&quot; career====
After his high-profile role, West, along with Burt Ward and Yvonne Craig (who played crime-fighting sidekicks Robin and Batgirl), were typecast; all three found it difficult to find other roles. West&#x27;s first post-Caped Crusader role was in the film &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1969). His lead performance against type as cynical tough guy Johnny Cain did not erode his Batman image; the film was a box office disappointment.

For a time, West made a living from personal appearances as Batman. In 1974, when Ward and Craig reprised their &quot;Batman&quot; roles for a TV public-service announcement about equal pay for women, West did not participate; instead, Dick Gautier appeared as Batman. After the series had ended, he appeared as Batman in a skit for the Memphis-based United States Wrestling Association, where he engaged in a war of words with Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler while wearing the cowl and a tracksuit, and even name-dropping Spider-Man.

West subsequently appeared in the theatrical films &quot;The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker&quot; (1971), &quot;The Specialist&quot; (1975), &quot;Hooper&quot; (as himself; 1978), &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood&quot; (1980), &quot;One Dark Night&quot; (1983) and &quot;Young Lady Chatterley II&quot; (1985). West also appeared in such television films as &quot;The Eyes of Charles Sand&quot; (1972), &quot;Poor Devil&quot; (1973), &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1975), &quot;For the Love of It&quot; (1980) and &quot;I Take These Men&quot; (1983).

West split his time between residences in Palm Springs, California, and Ketchum, Idaho.

He did guest shots on the television series &quot;Maverick&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;Bonanza&quot;; &quot;The Big Valley&quot;; &quot;Night Gallery&quot;; &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;; &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;; &quot;Alice&quot;; &quot;Police Woman&quot;; &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;; &quot;The American Girls&quot;; &quot;Vega$&quot;; &quot;Big Shamus, Little Shamus&quot;; &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;; &quot;Bewitched&quot;; &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;; &quot;Zorro&quot;; &quot;The King of Queens&quot;; and &quot;George Lopez&quot;. West was also in an episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; that supposedly never aired until reruns were shown and he made several guest appearances as himself on &quot;Family Feud&quot;. In 1986, he starred in the comedy police series titled &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;.

====Return to Batman====
West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot;, and in other shows such as &quot;The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour&quot;, &quot;Tarzan and the Super 7&quot;, &quot;Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show&quot; and &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot; (succeeding original &quot;Super Friends&quot; Batman voice Olan Soule in the role). In 1979, West once again donned the Batsuit for the live-action TV special &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot;. In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th-anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot; for his work on the &quot;Batman&quot; series.

West was considered to play Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s father, in Tim Burton&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film, but West rejected the role wanting to play Batman again. He was also a voice actor in various Batman-related animated series and films in addition to other projects connected to the TV series. West also guest starred in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Beware the Gray Ghost&quot; as Simon Trent, a washed-up actor who used to play a superhero in a TV series called &quot;The Gray Ghost&quot; and who now has difficulty finding work. He reprised his role of Batman in the Animaniacs episode &quot;Boo Wonder&quot; Season 5, Episode 3 of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;.

West suited up one final time in the full Batman outfit in 1997 for a photo session for TV Treasures magazine #1 titled &quot;Adam West Remembers 30 Years of Batman&quot;. He had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the 2004-2008 WB animated series &quot;The Batman&quot;. West was the voice of Batman in the 2005 animated short film &quot;Batman: New Times&quot;. He co-starred with Mark Hamill, who vocally portrayed The Joker and had originally played the role on &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;. West also voiced Thomas Wayne in a 2010 episode, &quot;Chill of the Night!&quot;, of the cartoon series &quot;&quot;.

In 2015, Adam West and Burt Ward announced that they would be reprising their roles as Batman and Robin (along with Julie Newmar as Catwoman) for two animated features to celebrate the oncoming 50th anniversary of the TV series. The first, &quot;&quot;, was released in theaters for one day on October 10, 2016 prior to being released on DVD and Blu-ray. The second, &quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot; co-starring William Shatner as &quot;Two-Face,&quot; was released on October 10, 2017, four months after West&#x27;s death.

===1990s–2000s===

During the 1990s, West&#x27;s status as a pop culture icon led to appearances as himself in the film &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; and in several TV series, including &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;, and &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. He notably appeared as &quot;Dr. Wayne&quot; in the 1990 &quot;Zorro&quot; episode &quot;The Wizard&quot;, even being shown Zorro&#x27;s &quot;secret cave&quot; headquarters. In 1991, he starred in the pilot episode of &quot;Lookwell&quot;, in which he portrayed a has-been TV action hero who falsely believes he can solve mysteries in real life. The pilot, written by Conan O&#x27;Brien and Robert Smigel in their pre-&quot;Late Night&quot; period, aired on NBC that summer, but was not picked up as a series. It was later broadcast on the Trio channel, under the &quot;Brilliant But Cancelled&quot; block. In 1994, West played a non-comedic role as the father of Peter Weller&#x27;s character in the Michael Tolkin film &quot;The New Age&quot;.

He played a washed-up superhero in the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; television series episode &quot;Attack of the Mutant&quot;. The boy hero is a comic book geek whose favorite superhero, Galloping Gazelle (West&#x27;s character), is portrayed as fading and on the verge of retirement. Towards the end, the boy is shocked to learn that the Gazelle is real, though he (the boy) must save the day by himself.

In 1994, West, with Jeff Rovin, wrote his autobiography, &quot;Back to the Batcave&quot; published by Berkeley Books. In 1997, Virgin Interactive released the gambling simulation game &quot;Golden Nugget&quot;. West acted in the video cut scenes of the &quot;Chaos Mystery&quot; storyline subgame. In 2001, he played the super-villain Breathtaker on the short-lived television series &quot;Black Scorpion&quot;.

In 2003, West and Burt Ward starred in the television film &quot;Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt&quot;, alongside Frank Gorshin, Julie Newmar, and Lee Meriwether. Jack Brewer portrayed West in flashbacks to the production of &quot;Batman&quot;. In 2005, West appeared as himself in the CBS show &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. He appears prominently in the 2006 video for California band STEFY&#x27;s song &quot;Chelsea&quot; as &quot;Judge Adam West&quot;, presiding over the courtroom scene.

In 2007, West appeared in a recurring role on &quot;George Lopez&quot;, as an attorney for George&#x27;s mother, and he starred as &quot;The Boss&quot; in the comedy film &quot;Sexina: Popstar PI&quot;. Following the release of a Batman game, a host of the show &quot;X-Play&quot; visited West on the show. In 2009, West played himself in the episode &quot;Apollo, Apollo&quot; of &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

===2010s===

In 2010, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. West received the 2,468th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 5, 2012. His star is located at 6764 Hollywood Boulevard in front of the Guinness Museum in Hollywood, California.

West appeared in a number of videos for Funnyordie.com.

He was interviewed in 2013 on the PBS series called &quot;Pioneers of Television&quot; in the season-three episode called &quot;Superheroes&quot;. Also in 2013, he was the subject of the documentary &quot;Starring Adam West&quot;.

West is among the interview subjects in &quot;Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle&quot;, a three-hour documentary narrated by Liev Schreiber that premiered on PBS in October 2013.

In February 2016, West guest-starred as himself on the 200th episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.

In January 2017, West appeared on the British comedy panel show &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; in which viewers and panellists looked around West&#x27;s Los Angeles home by video.

Walla Walla, Washington, Adam West&#x27;s hometown, officially celebrates its annual &quot;Adam West Day&quot; on September 19, with the first one celebrated in 2017.

===Voice-over work and advertising===

Having a distinctive voice, West built a career doing voice-over work on a number of animated series (often as himself), including appearances on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Histeria!&quot;, &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;.

He also appeared in many episodes of Nickelodeon&#x27;s cartoon &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; as a cat-obsessed version of himself, who is famous for playing a superhero called Catman, and who actually believes he is Catman. His later appearance in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; was a parody of himself, hired to play the role of the Crimson Chin in the film of the same name. Yet another appearance on the show had him as himself in a fairy-sponsored video about how to cope with losing one&#x27;s fairy godparents. After West&#x27;s death, he was replaced by Jeff Bennett.

In 1997, West appeared in a national television advertising campaign for Ziebart.

From 2000, West made regular appearances on the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, on which he played the fictional character of the same name, who was the lunatic mayor of Quahog, Rhode Island. His role brought West a new wave of popularity post-&quot;Batman&quot;, and lead writer Seth MacFarlane claims to have gone out of his way to avoid typecasting West by deliberately not making any references to Batman.

Some of his last voice-over performances were playing the role of Uncle Art in the Disney Animation film &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;, and voicing the young Mermaid Man (along with Burt Ward, who voiced the young Barnacle Boy) in the cartoon show &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, in the episode &quot;Back to the Past&quot; in 2010.

West also played the voice of General Carrington in the video game &quot;XIII&quot;, and voiced other video games such as &quot;Marc Eckō&#x27;s Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Chicken Little: Ace in Action&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo! Unmasked&quot;, and &quot;Goosebumps: Attack of the Mutant&quot;.

In November 2014, West voiced himself, the 1960s version of Batman, and the Gray Ghost in the video game &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;.

In 2016, West was the voice of TV&#x27;s Batman for the &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot; pinball game produced by Stern Pinball Incorporated.

West also did voice-over work for superhero-themed commercials for the investment firm LendingTree and television commercials for Hebrew National hot dogs.

==Personal life==

West was married three times. His first marriage was to his college girlfriend Billie Lou Yeager in 1950. The couple divorced six years later. In 1957, he married Cook Island dancer Ngatokorua Frisbie Dawson, part of the Puka Puka Otea in Hawaii. They had two children before their divorce in 1962. West then married Marcelle Tagand Lear in November 1970. They had two children and remained together for more than 46 years, until West&#x27;s death. West also had two step-children.

During the &quot;Batman&quot; television series, West&#x27;s relationship with co-star Burt Ward was jokingly described as &quot;problematic&quot;. He said, &quot;Burt fell victim to making up stories to sell books. But in a way it was flattering, because he made me sound like King Kong.&quot; West also said that he played Batman &quot;for laughs, but in order to do [that], one had to never think it was funny. You just had to pull on that cowl and believe that no one would recognize you.&quot; Also during the &quot;Batman&quot; series, he became close friends with crossover co-star Van Williams, who played &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. The two of them were also neighbors for a while and spent much time together outdoors, including fishing and hunting.

==Death==
On June 9, 2017, West died from leukemia in Los Angeles at the age of 88. In a statement, his former &quot;Batman&quot; co-star and longtime friend Burt Ward said: &quot;&quot; actor Kevin Conroy (who performed alongside West in the episode &quot;Beware the Gray Ghost&quot;) said: On June 15, 2017, Los Angeles projected the Bat-Signal on City Hall as a tribute to West, and in his hometown of Walla Walla, Washington, the Bat-Signal was shone upon the landmark Whitman Tower.

West had pre-recorded five more &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes as Mayor Adam West, which were released posthumously as part of the sixteenth season. He also recorded the 11th episode of &quot;Powerless&quot;, which never aired due to the show&#x27;s cancellation. NBC aired the episode online after West&#x27;s death.

West&#x27;s last public appearances were from March to April 2017 at the NorthEast ComicCon &amp; Collectibles Extravaganza in Hanover, Massachusetts, where he was the guest of honor, Fan Expo Dallas, and Silicon Valley Comic Con.

<text>Hyde Park is a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, located on and near the shore of Lake Michigan south of the Loop. It is one of the city&#x27;s 77 community areas.

Hyde Park&#x27;s boundaries and subdivisions have several local definitions. The community area&#x27;s formal boundaries are 51st Street (signed locally as Hyde Park Boulevard) on the north, Midway Plaisance on the south, Washington Park on the west, and Lake Michigan on the east. Another local definition considers a section to the north between 47th Street and Hyde Park Boulevard to be in Hyde Park, although this area is, according to municipal boundaries, the southern half of the Kenwood community area. As such, it is often called &quot;South Kenwood&quot;. Hyde Park and South Kenwood are also sometimes collectively termed &quot;Hyde Park-Kenwood&quot; (as in the name of the epoynmous Historic District, for example). Meanwhile, the portion of Hyde Park that lies between the Illinois Central Railroad tracks and the lake is usually referred to as &quot;East Hyde Park&quot; and is usually also taken to include &quot;Indian Village&quot;, the small southeastern corner of Kenwood.

Hyde Park is home to the University of Chicago and several seminaries: Catholic Theological Union, the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, and McCormick Theological Seminary (in addition to, UChicago&#x27;s own Divinity School). The Griffin Museum of Science and Industry and two of Chicago&#x27;s four historic sites listed in the original 1966 National Register of Historic Places—Chicago Pile-1, the world&#x27;s first artificial nuclear reactor, and Robie House—are also in the neighborhood. In the early 21st century, Hyde Park received national attention for its association with U.S. President Barack Obama, who, before running for president, was a Senior Lecturer for twelve years at the University of Chicago Law School, an Illinois state senator representing the area, and U.S. senator from Illinois. The Barack Obama Presidential Center is currently under construction in Jackson Park, on its border with Hyde Park.

== History ==
===Founding and early years===

In 1853, Paul Cornell, a real estate speculator and cousin of Cornell University founder Ezra Cornell, purchased of land between 51st and 55th streets along the shore of Lake Michigan, with the idea of attracting other Chicago businessmen and their families to the area. The neighborhood was named after a hamlet on the Hudson River of the same name in New York. The land was located seven miles south of Downtown Chicago in a rural area that enjoyed weather tempered by the lake – cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. It was conveniently located near the Illinois Central Railroad, which had been constructed two years earlier. Cornell successfully negotiated land in exchange for a railroad station at 53rd Street. Hyde Park quickly became a suburban retreat for affluent Chicagoans who wanted to escape the noise and congestion of the rapidly growing city.

In 1857, the Hyde Park House, an upscale hotel, was built on the shore of Lake Michigan near the 53rd Street railroad station. For two decades, the Hyde Park House served as a focal point of Hyde Park social life. During this period, it was visited or lived in by many prominent guests, including Mary Todd Lincoln, who lived there with her children for two and a half months in the summer of 1865 (shortly after her husband was assassinated). The Hyde Park House burned down in an 1879 fire. The Sisson Hotel was built on the site in 1918 and was eventually converted into a condominium building (the Hampton House).

In 1861, Hyde Park was incorporated into an independent township (called Hyde Park Township). Its boundaries were Pershing Road (39th Street) on the north, 138th Street on the south, State Street on the west, and Lake Michigan and the Indiana state line on the east. The territory of the township encompassed most of what is now the South Side of Chicago. Hyde Park Township remained independent of Chicago until it was annexed to the city in 1889. After annexation, the definition of Hyde Park as a Chicago neighborhood was restricted to the historic core of the former township, centered on Cornell&#x27;s initial development between 51st and 55th streets near the lakefront.

The &quot;Hyde Park Herald&quot;, the neighborhood&#x27;s community newspaper, was established in 1882 and continues to be published weekly.

===Growth and notability===
In 1891, two years after the city of Chicago annexed Hyde Park, the University of Chicago was established in the neighborhood through the philanthropy of John D. Rockefeller and the leadership of William Rainey Harper.

In 1893, Hyde Park hosted the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (a world&#x27;s fair marking the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus&#x27; arrival in the New World). The World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition brought fame to the neighborhood, which gave rise to an inflow of new residents and spurred new development that gradually started transforming Hyde Park into a more urban area. However, since most of the structures built for the fair were temporary, it left few direct traces in the neighborhood. The only major structure from the fair that is still standing today is Charles Atwood&#x27;s Palace of Fine Arts, which has since been converted into the Museum of Science and Industry.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, many upscale hotels were built in Hyde Park (mostly along the lakefront). Hyde Park became a resort area in Chicago. Most of these hotels closed during the Great Depression, and were eventually converted into apartment and condominium buildings (most of which are still standing today).

Historical images of Hyde Park can be found in Explore Chicago Collections, a digital repository made available by Chicago Collections archives, libraries and other cultural institutions in the city.

===Racial integration, economic decline, and urban renewal===
Until the middle of the twentieth century, Hyde Park remained an almost exclusively white neighborhood (despite its proximity to Chicago&#x27;s Black Belt). Hyde Parkers relied on racially restrictive covenants to keep African Americans out of the neighborhood. At the time, the use of such covenants was supported by the University of Chicago.

After the Supreme Court banned racially restrictive covenants in 1948, African Americans began moving into Hyde Park, and the neighborhood gradually became multiracial. In 1955, civil rights activist Leon Despres was elected alderman of Hyde Park and held the position for twenty years. Despres argued passionately for racial integration and fair housing on the floor of the Chicago City Council, and became known as the &quot;liberal conscience of Chicago&quot; for often casting the sole dissenting vote against the policies of Chicago&#x27;s then-mayor Richard J. Daley.

During the 1950s, Hyde Park experienced economic decline as a result of the white flight that followed the rapid inflow of African Americans into the neighborhood. In the 1950s and 1960s, the University of Chicago, in its effort to counteract these trends, sponsored one of the largest urban renewal plans in the nation. The plan involved the demolition and redevelopment of entire blocks of supposedly decayed buildings with the goal of creating an &quot;interracial community of high standards.&quot; After the plan was carried out, Hyde Park&#x27;s average income soared by seventy percent, but its African American population fell by forty percent, since the substandard housing primarily occupied by low-income African Americans had been purchased, torn down, and replaced, with the residents not being able to afford to remain in the newly rehabilitated areas. The ultimate result of the renewal plan was that Hyde Park did not experience the economic depression that occurred in the surrounding areas and became a racially integrated middle-class neighborhood.

==Subdivisions==

===The University of Chicago===
The central campus of the University of Chicago—including Pritzker School of Medicine, the University of Chicago Hospital, the historic Main Quadrangles, and the Booth School of Business—is bounded by Washington Park on the west, 55th Street on the north, University Ave. on the east, and 61st Street on the south, placing most of the university within Hyde Park&#x27;s southwestern quadrant (with the remainder, south of the Midway, being in Woodlawn). The university also owns a number of additional properties throughout Hyde Park, with many concentrated along a narrow corridor along 59th Street between the central campus and the Metra tracks—including, for example, the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and International House. Due to the university&#x27;s proximity, the blocks just east of the central campus are dominated by (privately owned) student and faculty residences.

===East Hyde Park===

The part of Hyde Park located east of the Metra tracks is locally called East Hyde Park. This area, the part of Hyde Park nearest to Lake Michigan, has a large number of high-rise condominiums, many of them facing the lakefront. Some of these condominiums are remnants of older hotels, like The Mayfair or Regents Park. In this respect, East Hyde Park differs markedly from the rest of Hyde Park, where the vast majority of residences are either three-story apartment buildings or single-family homes (with only a small number of high-rise condominiums).

===South Kenwood===
Although the neighborhood bounded by 47th Street on the north, 51st Street (Hyde Park Boulevard) on the south, Cottage Grove Avenue on the west, and Lake Michigan on the east is officially the southern half of the Kenwood community area, it is often considered part of Hyde Park due to the two areas&#x27; shared culture and history; &quot;Hyde Park-Kenwood&quot; is thus sometimes applied to this collective area (as in, e.g., the &quot;Hyde Park-Kenwood Historic District&quot;). Some differences are nonetheless apparent: unlike Hyde Park, which is dominated by three- and four-story apartment buildings and modest family homes, southern Kenwood boasts a great many luxurious mansions, built mainly at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries for wealthy Chicagoans. A number of prominent Chicagoans currently reside or own homes in this area, including former U.S. president Barack Obama and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Boxer Muhammad Ali and former Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad also once resided in south Kenwood.

==Demographics==
===Diversity===
Hyde Park is a very racially diverse neighborhood. Per 2020 U.S. census data, the neighborhood&#x27;s residents are 45.6% white, 26.7% Black, 14.6% Asian, and 7.2% Hispanic, while a further 5.9% identified as belonging to two or more races. The neighborhood&#x27;s northern and southern halves exhibit some demographic differences, however: south of 55th Street, the population is predominantly white and Asian-American, with a smaller percentage of African-Americans and Hispanics. North of 55th Street, African-Americans make up approximately half of the population, and there is a more robust Hispanic presence.

Hyde Park&#x27;s location in the center of the predominantly African-American South Side, as well as the neighborhood&#x27;s large population of affluent and upper-middle class Black residents, have made it an important cultural and political hub for Chicago&#x27;s Black community. Many of Chicago&#x27;s prominent African-American politicians live or have lived in Hyde Park, including former Chicago mayor Harold Washington, the city&#x27;s first Black mayor; former U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black female U.S. senator; former U.S. President Barack Obama; and Toni Preckwinkle, the current President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

==Landmarks==
The following Hyde Park community area properties have been added to the National Register of Historic Places: Chicago Beach Apartments, Arthur H. Compton House, East Park Towers, Chicago Pile-1, Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, Mayfair Apartments, Isadore H. Heller House, Charles Hitchcock Hall, Hotel Del Prado, Hotel Windermere East, Frank R. Lillie House, Robert A. Millikan House, Poinsettia Apartments, Promontory Apartments, Jackson Shore Apartments, Frederick C. Robie House, George Herbert Jones Laboratory, St. Thomas Church and Convent, Shoreland Hotel, German submarine U-505, and University Apartments.

In addition, the NRHP Hyde Park-Kenwood Historic District and Jackson Park Historic Landscape District and Midway Plaisance are located, at least in part, within the Hyde Park community area.

==Parks==
===Promontory Point===

Promontory Point is an artificial peninsula that extends into Lake Michigan at 55th Street, providing views of the Downtown Chicago skyline to the north. Promontory Point is a common location for picnicking, sunbathing, and swimming. It made news as the location of the wedding reception between George Lucas and Mellody Hobson in June 2013.
===Jackson Park===
The southeastern corner of Hyde Park contains the northern end of Jackson Park. Jackson Park consists of lagoons surrounding an island in the middle (called the Wooded Island), on which a small Japanese garden is located. It is home to a large population of beavers and over two dozen species of birds. The Midway Plaisance, a wide boulevard that runs from Stony Island Avenue to Cottage Grove Avenue between 59th and 60th streets, connects Jackson Park to Washington Park (located to the west of Hyde Park).

Jackson Park has been selected by the Obama Foundation as the site of the future Obama Presidential Center.

==Retail corridors==
The shopping areas on 53rd, 55th, and 57th streets host most of the retail businesses in Hyde Park.

===53rd Street===

53rd Street is Hyde Park&#x27;s oldest shopping district, lined with many small businesses and restaurants offering various dining options. Harper Court, a small-business-oriented shopping center, extends north of 53rd Street along Harper Avenue. A farmers&#x27; market is held there in the summer.

===55th Street===
The segment of 55th Street between the Metra line and the lake offers a series of ethnic restaurants serving Thai, Japanese, and Korean cuisine. To the west of the Metra line between 54th and 55th streets lies the Hyde Park Shopping Center.

===57th Street===
57th Street is noted for its independent bookstores. 57th Street also offers restaurants along with small grocery stores, hair stylists, and dry cleaners. On the first weekend in June, the venerable 57th Street Art Fair takes up 57th Street between Kimbark and Kenwood avenues.

==Politics==
The Hyde Park community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by overwhelming margins. In the 2016 presidential election, Hyde Park cast 10,479 votes for Hillary Clinton and 442 votes for Donald Trump (91.9% to 3.9%). In the 2012 presidential election, Hyde Park cast 9,991 votes for Barack Obama and cast 651 votes for Mitt Romney (91.4% to 6.0%).

==Transportation==
By car, Hyde Park is easily accessed from Lake Shore Drive, which runs along the neighborhood&#x27;s easternmost edge. The Dan Ryan Expressway and Chicago Skyway also lie within a short driving distance.

In terms of public transit, Hyde Park is served by eleven Chicago Transit Authority bus lines; Metra, Chicago&#x27;s commuter rail system; and the South Shore Line, an interurban passenger rail service that runs between Chicago and South Bend, Indiana. The latter two use the former Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s embankment in East Hyde Park, near Lake Michigan.

The Metra Electric—which has three stations in the neighborhood (51st/53rd St./Hyde Park, 55th-56th-57th St., and 59th St./University of Chicago)—and the CTA&#x27;s #6 Jackson Park Express bus provide express service to the Loop from early morning to late night. The #2 Hyde Park Express and #28 Stony Island busses provide similar service during rush hours. Off-peak, however, the #2 does not run, while the #28 does so only to points south. CTA&#x27;s #10 Museum of Science and Industry route also provides express service to downtown, but only between Memorial and Labor Days and from one stop at the museum itself.

CTA&#x27;s #15 Jeffrey Local bus runs diagonally through Hyde Park, connecting the neighborhood to points south and to CTA&#x27;s rapid transit system, the &quot;L&quot;, at the Red and Green Lines&#x27; 47th and 51st St. stations, respectively. The #55 Garfield bus runs east–west through the neighborhood, also connecting it to the Red and Green Lines at their respective Garfield stations, and, ultimately, to Chicago&#x27;s Midway Airport. The #4 Cottage Grove and #X4 Cottage Grove Express bus routes run north–south along Hyde Park&#x27;s westernmost edge.

CTA also operates three bus routes in collaboration with the University of Chicago: #171 University of Chicago/Hyde Park, #172 University of Chicago/Kenwood, and #192 University of Chicago Hospitals Express. The #171 and #172 are local circulator routes that run on a reduced schedule during the summer, while the #192 runs during rush hours only to and from major rail stations in the Loop.

South Shore Line trains stops only at 55th-56th-57th St. They only board passengers southbound and discharge passengers northbound due to a non-compete agreement with Metra.

<doc id="278666" wikidata="Q6966220" url="?curid=278666" title="Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars">
<text>Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars, in the years 1712, 13, 14, and 15 is a record of the travel to Kalmykia, written by Tulišen, a Manchu official who lived in the Qing dynasty.

The book was written in both Manchu and Chinese. The title is:
*in Manchu: &quot;Lakcaha jecen-de takūraha babe ejehe bithe&quot; (The book of the account of the process of having been to a distant region as an ambassador)
*in Chinese: &quot;Yiyulu&quot; (, ‘Record of foreign regions’)

The English title is &quot;Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars, in the years 1712, 13, 14, and 15, by the Chinese Ambassador, and published by the Emperor&#x27;s Authority, at Peking.&quot; This is from Sir George Thomas Staunton&#x27;s translation in 1821. Although the Chinese version is more popular, the Manchu version offers higher quality information.

In 1712, Kangxi Emperor sent Tulišen and other emissaries to the Kalmyk Khanate to convey an imperial edict to Ayuka Khan of the Torghuts. They left Beijing, crossed Mongolia and then entered Russia. In order to avoid Dzungaria, they travelled through the Russian Empire to Saratov and entered into Ayuki&#x27;s Torghut state (&quot;Turgūt gurun&quot; in Manchu). Having accomplished the mission, they returned to Beijing in 1715. Tulišen reported to the Emperor in both Manchu and Chinese. With the Emperor&#x27;s permission, he published the book by editing these reports and private notes.

The formal purpose of this mission was to negotiate over the return of Ayuki&#x27;s nephew Arabjur to Kalmykia. As a Buddhist, he made a pilgrimage to Tibet but was unable to return to Kalmykia because of the Dzungars&#x27; obstruction. Another purpose was to reconnoiter expanding Russia. In fact, the book is mostly devoted to the description of Russia. Some Russians suspected that the emissaries secretly encouraged the Torghuud to return to their homeland as Ayuki&#x27;s great-grandson Ubashi did later.

In Tulisen&#x27;s Manchu language record, it was mentioned that while the Torghuts were unlike the Russians, the &quot;people of the Central Kingdom&quot; (dulimba-i gurun 中國, Zhongguo) were like the Torghut Mongols, and the &quot;people of the Central Kingdom&quot; referred to the Manchus.

<doc id="278728" wikidata="Q775724" url="?curid=278728" title="Arabic diacritics">
<text>The Arabic script has numerous diacritics, which include consonant pointing known as &#x27; (), and supplementary diacritics known as &#x27; (). The latter include the vowel marks termed  (; , &quot;).

The Arabic script is a modified abjad, where all letters are consonants, leaving it up to the reader to fill in the vowel sounds. Short consonants and long vowels are represented by letters, but short vowels and consonant length are not generally indicated in writing. &quot; is optional to represent missing vowels and consonant length. Modern Arabic is always written with the &quot;i‘jām&quot;—consonant pointing—but only religious texts, children&#x27;s books and works for learners are written with the full &quot;tashkīl&quot;—vowel guides and consonant length. It is, however, not uncommon for authors to add diacritics to a word or letter when the grammatical case or the meaning is deemed otherwise ambiguous. In addition, classical works and historical documents rendered to the general public are often rendered with the full &quot;tashkīl&quot;, to compensate for the gap in understanding resulting from stylistic changes over the centuries.

Moreover, tashkīl can change the meaning of the entire word, for example, the words: (دِين), meaning (religion), and (دَين), meaning (debt). Even though they have the same letters, their meanings are different because of the tashkīl. In sentences without tashkīl, readers understand the meaning of the word by simply using context.

== &quot;Tashkīl&quot; ==

The literal meaning of &#x27; is &#x27;formation&#x27;. As the normal Arabic text does not provide enough information about the correct pronunciation, the main purpose of &#x27; (and &quot;) is to provide a phonetic guide or a phonetic aid; i.e. show the correct pronunciation for children who are learning to read or foreign learners.

The bulk of Arabic script is written without &#x27; (or short vowels). However, they are commonly used in texts that demand strict adherence to exact pronunciation. This is true, primarily, of the Qur&#x27;an (&#x27;) and . It is also quite common to add &#x27; to hadiths (&#x27;; plural: &#x27;) and the . Another use is in children&#x27;s literature. Moreover, &#x27; are used in ordinary texts in individual words when an ambiguity of pronunciation cannot easily be resolved from context alone. Arabic dictionaries with vowel marks provide information about the correct pronunciation to both native and foreign Arabic speakers. In art and calligraphy, &quot; might be used simply because their writing is considered aesthetically pleasing.

An example of a fully &quot;vocalised&quot; (&quot;vowelised&quot; or &quot;vowelled&quot;) Arabic from the &quot;Bismillah&quot;:

Some Arabic textbooks for foreigners now use &#x27; as a phonetic guide to make learning reading Arabic easier. The other method used in textbooks is phonetic romanisation of unvocalised texts. Fully vocalised Arabic texts (i.e. Arabic texts with &#x27;/diacritics) are sought after by learners of Arabic. Some online bilingual dictionaries also provide &quot;&quot; as a phonetic guide similarly to English dictionaries providing transcription.

=== Ḥarakāt (short vowel marks) ===

The &#x27; , which literally means &#x27;motions&#x27;, are the short vowel marks. There is some ambiguity as to which &#x27; are also &#x27;; the &#x27;, for example, are markers for both vowels and consonants.

==== Fatḥah ====
The is a small diagonal line placed &quot;above&quot; a letter, and represents a short (like the /a/ sound in the English word &quot;cat&quot;). The word &quot;&quot; itself () means &quot;opening&quot; and refers to the opening of the mouth when producing an . For example, with &quot;&quot; (henceforth, the base consonant in the following examples): . 
When a is placed before a plain letter (&quot;&quot;) (i.e. one having no hamza or vowel of its own), it represents a long (close to the sound of &quot;a&quot; in the English word &quot;dad&quot;, with an open front vowel /æː/, not back /ɑː/ as in &quot;father&quot;). For example: . The &#x27; is not usually written in such cases. When a fathah is placed before the letter ⟨⟩ (yā’), it creates an (as in &quot;lie&quot;); and when placed before the letter ⟨⟩ (wāw), it creates an (as in &quot;cow&quot;).

Although paired with a plain letter creates an open front vowel (/a/), often realized as near-open (/æ/), the standard also allows for variations, especially under certain surrounding conditions. Usually, in order to have the more central (/ä/) or back (/ɑ/) pronunciation, the word features a nearby back consonant, such as the emphatics, as well as &quot;qāf&quot;, or &quot;rā’&quot;. A similar &quot;back&quot; quality is undergone by other vowels as well in the presence of such consonants, however not as drastically realized as in the case of .

, 
, or 

==== Kasrah ====
A similar diagonal line &quot;below&quot; a letter is called a and designates a short (as in &quot;me&quot;, &quot;be&quot;) and its allophones [i, ɪ, e, e̞, ɛ] (as in &quot;Tim&quot;, &quot;sit&quot;). For example: .

When a &#x27; is placed before a plain letter (&quot;&quot;), it represents a long (as in the English word &quot;steed&quot;). For example: . The &#x27; is usually not written in such cases, but if &quot;&quot; is pronounced as a diphthong , &#x27; should be written on the preceding letter to avoid mispronunciation. The word &#x27; means &#x27;breaking&#x27;.
 
&quot;&quot;s are encoded , 
, or 

==== Ḍammah ====
The is a small curl-like diacritic placed above a letter to represent a short /u/ (as in &quot;duke&quot;, shorter &quot;you&quot;) and its allophones [u, ʊ, o, o̞, ɔ] (as in &quot;put&quot;, or &quot;bull&quot;). For example: .

When a is placed before a plain letter (&#x27;), it represents a long (like the &#x27;oo&#x27; sound in the English word &quot;swoop&quot;). For example: . The &#x27; is usually not written in such cases, but if &#x27; is pronounced as a diphthong , &#x27; should be written on the preceding consonant to avoid mispronunciation.
The word &quot;ḍammah&quot; (ضَمَّة) in this context means &quot;rounding&quot;, since it is the only rounded vowel in the vowel inventory of Arabic. 
&quot;&quot;s are encoded , 
, or 

==== Alif Khanjarīyah ====
The superscript (or dagger) &#x27; (&#x27;), is written as short vertical stroke on top of a letter. It indicates a long sound for which &quot;&quot; is normally not written. For example: (&#x27;) or (&#x27;).

The dagger &#x27; occurs in only a few words, but they include some common ones; it is seldom written, however, even in fully vocalised texts. Most keyboards do not have dagger &quot;.&quot; The word Allah () is usually produced automatically by entering &quot;.&quot; The word consists of &#x27; + ligature of doubled &#x27; with a &#x27; and a dagger &#x27; above &#x27;, followed by &quot;ha&quot;&#x27;.
=== Maddah ===

The is a tilde-shaped diacritic, which can only appear on top of an alif (آ) and indicates a glottal stop followed by a long .

In theory, the same sequence could also be represented by two &#x27;s, as in *, where a hamza above the first &#x27; represents the while the second &#x27; represents the . However, consecutive &#x27;s are never used in the Arabic orthography. Instead, this sequence must always be written as a single &#x27; with a &#x27; above it, the combination known as an &quot;&quot;. For example: .

In Quranic writings, a &quot;maddah&quot; is placed on any other letter to denote the name of the letter, though some letters may take on a dagger &quot;alif&quot;. For example: (&quot;lām&quot;-&quot;mīm&quot;-&quot;ṣād&quot;) or (&quot;yāʼ-sīn)&quot;

=== Alif waṣlah ===

The &#x27; , &#x27; or looks like the head of a small &quot;&quot; on top of an &#x27; (also indicated by an &#x27; without a &#x27;). It means that the &#x27; is not pronounced when its word does not begin a sentence. For example: (&quot;&quot;), but (&quot;imshū&quot; not &quot;mshū&quot;). This is because in Arabic, the first consonant in a word must always be followed by a vowel sound: If the second letter from the has a kasrah, the alif-waslah makes the sound /i/. However, when the second letter from it has a dammah, it makes the sound /u/.

It occurs only in the beginning of words, but it can occur after prepositions and the definite article. It is commonly found in imperative verbs, the perfective aspect of verb stems VII to X and their verbal nouns (&#x27;). The &quot;alif&quot; of the definite article is considered a &#x27;.

It occurs in phrases and sentences (connected speech, not isolated/dictionary forms):
* To replace the elided hamza whose alif-seat has assimilated to the previous vowel. For example: or (&quot;) &#x27;in Yemen&#x27;.
* In hamza-initial imperative forms following a vowel, especially following the conjunction (&#x27;) &#x27;and&#x27;. For example: َ (&#x27;) &#x27;rise and then drink the water&#x27;.

Like the superscript alif, it is not written in fully vocalized scripts, except for sacred texts, like the Quran and Arabized Bible.

=== Sukūn ===
The is a circle-shaped diacritic placed above a letter (). It indicates that the letter to which it is attached is not followed by a vowel, i.e., zero-vowel.

It is a necessary symbol for writing consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, which are very common in Arabic. For example: (&quot;).

The may also be used to help represent a diphthong. A &#x27; followed by the letter (&quot;&quot;) with a over it () indicates the diphthong &#x27; (IPA ). A &#x27;, followed by the letter (&#x27;) with a &quot;, () indicates . 
&quot;s are encoded , , or . 

The may have also an alternative form of the small high head of &#x27; (), particularly in some Qurans. Other shapes may exist as well (for example, like a small comma above ⟨ʼ⟩ or like a circumflex ⟨ˆ⟩ in &#x27;).


=== Tanwīn ===

The three vowel diacritics may be doubled at the end of a word to indicate that the vowel is followed by the consonant &quot;n&quot;. They may or may not be considered and are known as , or nunation. The signs indicate, from left to right, .

These endings are used as non-pausal grammatical indefinite case endings in Literary Arabic or classical Arabic (triptotes only). In a vocalised text, they may be written even if they are not pronounced (see pausa). See &quot;&quot; for more details. In many spoken Arabic dialects, the endings are absent. Many Arabic textbooks introduce standard Arabic without these endings. The grammatical endings may not be written in some vocalized Arabic texts, as knowledge of &quot;&quot; varies from country to country, and there is a trend towards simplifying Arabic grammar.

The sign is most commonly written in combination with (&quot;&quot;), (&quot;&quot;), (alif hamzah) or stand-alone (&#x27;). &#x27; should always be written (except for words ending in &#x27; or diptotes) even if &#x27; is not. Grammatical cases and &quot; endings in indefinite triptote forms:

* &quot;: nominative case;
* &quot;: accusative case, also serves as an adverbial marker;
* &quot;: genitive case.
=== Shaddah ===

The shadda or shaddah (&#x27;), or tashdid (&#x27;), is a diacritic shaped like a small written Latin &quot;w&quot;.

It is used to indicate gemination (consonant doubling or extra length), which is phonemic in Arabic. It is written above the consonant which is to be doubled. It is the only &#x27; that is commonly used in ordinary spelling to avoid ambiguity. For example: ; &#x27; (&#x27;school&#x27;) vs. &quot; (&#x27;teacher&#x27;, female). Note that when the doubled letter bears a vowel, it is the shaddah that the vowel is attached to, not the letter itself: , .
 
&quot;s are encoded , 
, or 
 
== I‘jām ==
The &quot;i‘jām&quot; (; sometimes also called &#x27;) are the diacritic points that distinguish various consonants that have the same form (&#x27;), such as , . Typically &quot;i‘jām&quot; are not considered diacritics but part of the letter.

Early manuscripts of the Quran did not use diacritics either for vowels or to distinguish the different values of the &quot;.&quot; Vowel pointing was introduced first, as a red dot placed above, below, or beside the &#x27;, and later consonant pointing was introduced, as thin, short black single or multiple dashes placed above or below the &quot;rasm&quot;. These &quot;i‘jām&quot; became black dots about the same time as the &#x27; became small black letters or strokes.

Typically, Egyptians do not use dots under final &#x27; (), which looks exactly like &#x27; () in handwriting and in print. This practice is also used in copies of the &quot;&quot; (Qurʾān) scribed by . The same unification of &#x27; and &#x27; has happened in Persian, resulting in what the Unicode Standard calls &quot;&quot;, that looks exactly the same as &#x27; in initial and medial forms, but exactly the same as &#x27; in final and isolated forms.

At the time when the &quot;i‘jām&quot; was optional, unpointed letters were ambiguous. To clarify that a letter would lack &quot;i‘jām&quot; in pointed text, the letter could be marked with a small v- or seagull-shaped diacritic above, also a superscript semicircle (crescent), a subscript dot (except in the case of ; three dots were used with ), or a subscript miniature of the letter itself. A superscript stroke known as &quot;jarrah&quot;, resembling a long &quot;fatħah&quot;, was used for a contracted (assimilated) &quot;sin&quot;. Thus were all used to indicate that the letter in question was truly and not . These signs, collectively known as &quot;‘alāmātu-l-ihmāl&quot;, are still occasionally used in modern Arabic calligraphy, either for their original purpose (i.e. marking letters without &quot;i‘jām&quot;), or often as purely decorative space-fillers. The small above the &quot;kāf&quot; in its final and isolated forms was originally an &quot;‘alāmatu-l-ihmāl&quot; that became a permanent part of the letter. Previously this sign could also appear above the medial form of &quot;kāf&quot;, when that letter was written without the stroke on its ascender. When &quot;kaf&quot; was written without that stroke, it could be mistaken for &quot;lam&quot;, thus &quot;kaf&quot; was distinguished with a superscript &quot;kaf&quot; or a small superscript &quot;hamza&quot; (&quot;nabrah&quot;), and &quot;lam&quot; with a superscript &quot;l-a-m&quot; (&quot;lam-alif-mim&quot;).

== &quot;Hamza&quot; ==


Although not always considered a letter of the alphabet, the hamza (&#x27;, glottal stop), often stands as a separate letter in writing, is written in unpointed texts and is not considered a &quot;.&quot; It may appear as a letter by itself or as a diacritic over or under an &#x27;, &#x27;, or &#x27;.

Which letter is to be used to support the &quot; depends on the quality of the adjacent vowels and its location in the word;

* If the glottal stop occurs at the beginning of the word:
** Indicated by hamza on an &quot;: above if the following vowel is or and below if it is .
*** In order to clarify a starting /a/ or /u/, a respective &quot;fathah&quot; or &quot;dammah&quot; can be used
* If the glottal stop occurs in the middle of the word the following prioritization of writing qualities are used:
** First&quot;:&quot; if &quot;hamza&quot; is it is preceded or followed by , &quot;hamza&quot; sits on a tooth; ex: &lt;عَائِلَة&gt;
** Second: if &quot;hamza&quot; is preceded or followed by /u/, &quot;hamza&quot; sits on &quot;, &lt;ؤ&gt;&quot;
** Third: else hamza sits on &quot;alif&quot;, &lt;أ&gt; 
* If the glottal stop occurs at the end of the word (ignoring any grammatical suffixes), 
** First: if &quot;hamza&quot; follows a short vowel it is written above &#x27;, &#x27;, or &quot;&quot; the same as for a medial case; 
** Second: if it follows a long vowel, diphthong or consonant, &quot;hamza&quot; is written on the line &lt;ء&gt;
* Exception: Two &#x27;s in succession are never allowed: is written with &quot;&quot; and is written with a free &#x27; on the line .

Consider the following words: (&quot;brother&quot;), (&quot;Ismael&quot;), (&quot;mother&quot;). All three of above words &quot;begin&quot; with a vowel opening the syllable, and in each case, &quot;&quot; is used to designate the initial glottal stop (the &quot;actual&quot; beginning). But if we consider &quot;middle&quot; syllables &quot;beginning&quot; with a vowel: (&quot;origin&quot;), (&quot;hearts&quot;—notice the syllable; singular ), (&quot;heads&quot;, singular ), the situation is different, as noted above. See the comprehensive article on &quot;hamzah&quot; for more details.
==Diacritics not used in Modern Standard Arabic==
Diacritics not used in Modern Standard Arabic but in other languages that use the Arabic script, and sometimes to write Arabic dialects, include (the list is not exhaustive):
===Rohingya tone markers===
Historically Arabic script has been adopted and used by many tonal languages, examples include Xiao&#x27;erjing for Mandarin Chinese as well as Ajami script adopted for writing various languages of Western Africa. However, the Arabic script never had an inherent way of representing tones until it was adapted for the Rohingya language. The &quot;Rohingya Fonna&quot; are 3 tone markers which are part of the standardized and accepted orthographic convention of Rohingya. It remains the only known instance of tone markers within the Arabic script.

Tone markers act as &quot;modifiers&quot; of vowel diacritics. In simpler words, they are &quot;diacritics for the diacritics&quot;. They are written &quot;outside&quot; of the word, meaning that they are written above the vowel diacritic if the diacritic is written above the word, and they are written below the diacritic if the diacritic is written below the word. They are only ever written where there are vowel diacritics. This is important to note, as without the diacritic present, there is no way to distinguish between tone markers and &quot;I‘jām&quot; i.e. dots that are used for purpose of phonetic distinctions of consonants.

Hārbāy
The Hārbāy as it is called in Rohingya, is a single dot that&#x27;s placed on top of &quot;Fatḥah&quot; and &quot;Ḍammah&quot;, or &quot;curly Fatḥah&quot; and &quot;curly Ḍammah&quot; (vowel diacritics unique to Rohinghya), or their respective &quot;Fatḥatan&quot; and &quot;Ḍammatan&quot; versions, and it&#x27;s placed underneath &quot;Kasrah&quot; or &quot;curly Kasrah&quot;, or their respective &quot;Kasratan&quot; version. (e.g. ) This tone marker indicates a short high tone ().

Ṭelā
The Ṭelā as it is called in Rohingya, is two dots that are placed on top of &quot;Fatḥah&quot; and &quot;Ḍammah&quot;, or &quot;curly Fatḥah&quot; and &quot;curly Ḍammah&quot;, or their respective &quot;Fatḥatan&quot; and &quot;Ḍammatan&quot; versions, and it&#x27;s placed underneath &quot;Kasrah&quot; or &quot;curly Kasrah&quot;, or their respective &quot;Kasratan&quot; version. (e.g. ) This tone marker indicates a long falling tone ().

Ṭāna
The Ṭāna as it is called in Rohingya, is a fish-like looping line that is placed on top of &quot;Fatḥah&quot; and &quot;Ḍammah&quot;, or &quot;curly Fatḥah&quot; and &quot;curly Ḍammah&quot;, or their respective &quot;Fatḥatan&quot; and &quot;Ḍammatan&quot; versions, and it&#x27;s placed underneath &quot;Kasrah&quot; or &quot;curly Kasrah&quot;, or their respective &quot;Kasratan&quot; version. (e.g. ) This tone marker indicates a long rising tone ().

== History ==
According to tradition, the first to commission a system of &quot;ḥarakāt&quot; was Ali who appointed Abu al-Aswad al-Du&#x27;ali for the task. Abu al-Aswad devised a system of dots to signal the three short vowels (along with their respective allophones) of Arabic. This system of dots predates the &quot;, dots used to distinguish between different consonants.

=== Abu al-Aswad&#x27;s system ===
Abu al-Aswad&#x27;s system of Harakat was different from the system we know today. The system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel.

A dot above a letter indicated the vowel &#x27;, a dot below indicated the vowel &#x27;, a dot on the side of a letter stood for the vowel &quot;, and two dots stood for the &quot;&quot;.

However, the early manuscripts of the Qur&#x27;an did not use the vowel signs for every letter requiring them, but only for letters where they were necessary for a correct reading.

=== Al Farahidi&#x27;s system ===
The precursor to the system we know today is Al Farahidi&#x27;s system. &quot;&quot; found that the task of writing using two different colours was tedious and impractical. Another complication was that the &quot; had been introduced by then, which, while they were short strokes rather than the round dots seen today, meant that without a color distinction the two could become confused.

Accordingly, he replaced the &quot; with small superscript letters: small alif, yā’, and wāw for the short vowels corresponding to the long vowels written with those letters, a small &quot;s(h)īn&quot; for &quot;shaddah&quot; (geminate), a small &quot;khā’&quot; for &quot;khafīf&quot; (short consonant; no longer used). His system is essentially the one we know today.

== Automatic diacritization ==
The process of automatically restoring diacritical marks is called diacritization or diacritic restoration. It is useful to avoid ambiguity in applications such as Arabic machine translation, text-to-speech, and information retrieval. Automatic diacritization algorithms have been developed. For Modern Standard Arabic, the state-of-the-art algorithm has a word error rate (WER) of 4.79%. The most common mistakes are proper nouns and case endings. Similar algorithms exist for other varieties of Arabic.

<text>Victor Joseph Auguste D&#x27;Hondt (; 20 November 1841 – 30 May 1901) was a Belgian lawyer and jurist of civil law at Ghent University. He devised a procedure, the D&#x27;Hondt method, which he first described in 1878, for allocating seats to candidates in party-list proportional representation elections. The method has been adopted by a number of countries, including Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Fiji, Finland, Israel, Japan, North Macedonia, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Paraguay, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovenia, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Iceland, Uruguay and Wales. A modified D&#x27;Hondt system is used for elections to the London Assembly and the Scottish Parliament.

Victor D’Hondt was an influential proponent of proportional representation in Belgium. He published several articles on proportional representation and was founding member of the &quot;Association Réformiste Belge pour l&#x27;Adoption de la Representation Proportionnelle&quot; in 1881. From 1885 he served as professor of civil and fiscal law at the University of Ghent. In 1896 he was awarded the title &quot;Officer&quot; in the Belgian Order of Leopold.

<text>Hurricane Hugo was a powerful tropical cyclone that inflicted widespread destruction across the northeastern Caribbean and the Southeastern United States in September 1989. The eleventh tropical cyclone, eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, Hugo arose from a cluster of thunderstorms near Cape Verde on September 10, 1989. This cluster coalesced into a tropical depression and strengthened into Tropical Storm Hugo as it tracked west across the Atlantic Ocean for several days. On September 13, Hugo became a hurricane and continued to intensify through September 15 when its sustained winds peaked at , making it a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Between September 17 and 21, Hugo made landfall on Guadeloupe, Saint Croix, Puerto Rico, and lastly South Carolina, with major hurricane strength winds. The storm weakened inland and accelerated north over the Eastern United States, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 23 before it was last noted in the far northern Atlantic on September 25.

Hugo left extensive damage in its wake, causing 67 deaths and $11 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in damage, which at the time, made it the costliest hurricane on record. Guadeloupe bore the brunt of the storm in the Leeward Islands. Three thousand houses were unroofed, contributing to the displacement of 35,000 people from their homes. Hugo was Montserrat&#x27;s costliest hurricane on record and brought down the island&#x27;s entire power grid. Ninety percent of homes on the island suffered significant to total roof loss after the island was struck by the eyewall. The hurricane&#x27;s impacts continued into the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, causing over $1 billion in damage. Wind gusts up to were measured in Saint Croix, where property damage exceeded $500 million with over 90 percent of buildings damaged; three people were killed on the island. Widespread damage occurred in Puerto Rico and much of the island suffered power and water service failures. Eight people were killed in Puerto Rico and nearly 28,000 people were left homeless. In the mainland United States, coastal South Carolina was hit by record setting storm surge heights, reaching near McClellanville. The surge and strong winds wrought extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure across South Carolina, and caused 13 deaths. Flood and wind impacts followed Hugo across much of the Eastern United States into Eastern Canada.

There were widespread and significant agricultural impacts from Hugo. Guadeloupe sustained damage to the entirety of its banana crop and most of its coconut palms and sugar cane crop. Habitat loss caused bat populations in Montserrat to fall 20-fold, while the populations of several endemic bird species declined or were disrupted across the eastern Caribbean. Coastal bird populations in South Carolina were forced inland. Additionally, forests between South Carolina and Virginia were heavily damaged; in South Carolina alone the loss of timber was estimated at $1.04 billion.

Hugo was the strongest hurricane to strike the northeastern Caribbean since Hurricane David in 1979, and the strongest to make landfall on the continental U.S. since Hurricane Camille in 1969. The scale of the hurricane&#x27;s impacts led to the retirement of the name &quot;Hugo&quot; from the Atlantic tropical cyclone name list.

== Meteorological history ==

Hurricane Hugo was a Cape Verde hurricane that developed from a cluster of thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave first observed moving off the coast of Africa on September 9, near Cape Verde. (part of that same wave would later spawn Hurricane Raymond in the eastern Pacific). A tropical depression developed from this disturbance roughly south of Cape Verde the following day. The nascent cyclone intensified as it tracked west along the 12th parallel north and across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, reaching tropical storm strength on September 11, and hurricane strength on September 13, while located about east of the Leeward Islands. The presence of another area of low-pressure north of Puerto Rico produced a gap in the Azores High, causing Hugo to then gradually turn towards the west-northwest with its forward speed decelerating.
At 18:00 UTC on September 15, the first aircraft reconnaissance mission to probe Hugo reported that it had intensified to a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum central barometric pressure of , which turned out to be its peak intensity. Still several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands at the time, this made Hugo the easternmost Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic. Its winds tapered as it approached the Caribbean; at 05:00 UTC on September 17, Hugo&#x27;s eye passed over Guadeloupe with sustained winds of . The next day, the hurricane made three landfalls, first on Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with sustained winds of , followed by Vieques and Fajardo in Puerto Rico, with sustained winds of in each instance.

Hugo&#x27;s encounter with Puerto Rico weakened the storm substantially, its eye became ill-defined in satellite imagery and its winds had diminished to around by 06:00 UTC on September 19. However, the hurricane&#x27;s return to open waters provided suitable conditions for reintensification. By this juncture, the broader weather patterns that steered Hugo had changed: the Azores High became a dominant influence north of the hurricane and an upper-level low emerged over Georgia. These two features generated a strong southeasterly steering flow within which Hugo was contained, shaping its trajectory towards the Southeastern United States. As the hurricane accelerated away from Puerto Rico at about , it became better organized and its eye became increasingly well defined. On September 21, Hugo passed over the Gulf Stream and intensified markedly over a period of 30 hours, re-strengthening to a Category 4 hurricane. At 04:00 UTC on September 22, Hugo made its last landfall on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, South Carolina, with sustained winds of . Hugo&#x27;s forward motion was beginning to accelerate northward at the time in response to an extratropical cyclone moving across the central U.S., and this curvature and acceleration continued as Hugo moved farther inland. The intensity of the winds decreased after landfall, particularly as Hugo began interacting with the Appalachian Mountains; by dawn on September 22, Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm when it was just west of Charlotte, North Carolina. The next day, it transitioned into an extratropical storm near Erie, Pennsylvania, and continued across eastern Canada, eventually moving into the far northern Atlantic where it was last noted on September 25.

=== Reconnaissance flight N42RF ===
Between September 15 and September 22, aircraft from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) penetrated the eye of Hugo 76 times, documenting the location of the storm&#x27;s center roughly once every two hours. Among these planes was a WP-3D Orion serviced by the NOAA and nicknamed &quot;Kermit&quot; (callsign &quot;N42RF&quot;). It had been deployed to Barbados alongside another WP-3D Orion as part of a research experiment coordinated by the Hurricane Research Division. While penetrating the storm at an altitude of , the plane encountered extreme turbulence and sustained winds of , indicating a storm more intense than satellite estimates suggested. Flight data showed that the plane likely encountered a mesovortex comparable to a weak tornado spanning a kilometer across. One of &quot;Kermit&quot; four engines overheated within the hurricane&#x27;s eyewall, prompting its shutdown that caused the plane to quickly lose altitude as it entered the eye. The pilots regained control when the plane reached an altitude of at 17:28 UTC. To avoid overworking the three remaining engines, the pilots orbited the center of Hugo for an hour within the eye while bringing the plane to a gradual ascent. Fuel was also ejected from &quot;Kermit&quot; lower fuselage. The plane climbed to an altitude of before departing the eye via the northeast eyewall and returning to Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados.

== Preparations ==
=== Watches and warnings ===
In the northeastern Caribbean, warnings issued by the NHC were disseminated by the six meteorological offices of the Caribbean Meteorological Council. The first hurricane watch was issued by the NHC at 09:00 UTC on September 15, covering much of the Lesser Antilles from Saint Lucia northward to the British Virgin Islands. The watch was escalated to a hurricane warning three hours later. Concurrent watches and warnings for tropical storm conditions were in effect for Saint Vincent and Barbados. These initial alerts were discontinued following the storm&#x27;s passage by September 18. A hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 15; this was superseded by a hurricane warning the following day that in turn was lifted on September 19. As Hugo tracked northwest across the Sargasso Sea between September 19 and 20, tropical storm warnings were issued for coastal areas of the Dominican Republic and The Bahamas. The NHC first issued hurricane watches for portions of the East Coast of the United States on September 20, escalating to a hurricane warning for some coastal areas on September 21. The coverage of these watches and warnings were incrementally revised leading up to Hugo&#x27;s final landfall; at their greatest extent, hurricane watches were in effect between St. Augustine, Florida, and the Chesapeake Bay, while hurricane warnings were in effect between Fernandina Beach, Florida, and Oregon Inlet in North Carolina. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 16:00 UTC on September 22.

=== Caribbean ===
Barbados served as a staging area for disaster response in the Caribbean due to its strategic position in the region and distance away from Hugo&#x27;s forecast impacts. Several relief agencies had convened in Barbados earlier in 1989 to coordinate hurricane response plans. These agencies were mobilized ahead of Hugo&#x27;s arrival in the Lesser Antilles. They were joined by additional teams from the United States Agency for International Development and the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). Additional relief teams from the OFDA, Pan American Health Organization, Red Cross, and United Nations Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator were pre-positioned in Antigua to survey the damage and prioritize aid in Hugo&#x27;s aftermath. The government of Dominica urged its citizens to take emergency precautions. The Dominican Ministry of Public Works prepositioned earthmoving equipment around Dominica to clear landslide debris. A curfew in Guadeloupe mandating that streets be clear of pedestrians and vehicles came into effect at 6 p.m. AST on September 17. Leading up to the curfew, residents rushed hardware stores and supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Many on the Atlantic-facing side of Guadeloupe evacuated farther inland. Cable television played a significant role in keeping residents of Martinique updated on the hurricane&#x27;s approach. Though no formal evacuation order was enacted for Martinique, the prefect of Martinique recommended the evacuation of the low-lying Kinsale area on September 16. Twenty-four evacuation shelters were opened throughout the island. Disaster preparedness plans were set into motion by Martinique&#x27;s government ministries, dispatching crews to board windows and secure buildings. Air France cancelled its three Martinique-bound flights from Paris scheduled for September 18; flights to the Lesser Antilles were largely cancelled by the afternoon of September 16. Most buildings in Antigua were shuttered by noon on September 17 and all local ships were brought to their moorings. V. C. Bird International Airport closed and the island&#x27;s electric grid was turned off.

At least 30,000 people evacuated in Puerto Rico, making it one of the largest evacuations in the territory&#x27;s history; government and media representatives described the evacuation as &quot;the best coordinated weather event they could recall.&quot; Three thousand people evacuated from southeastern Puerto Rico and five thousand evacuated from San Juan neighborhoods. However, many were initially reluctant to leave. La Perla was evacuated for the first time in living memory. Hundreds of evacuees were brought to a stadium in Mayagüez. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport terminated all scheduled flights at 6 p.m. AST on September 17. All international airlines evacuated their aircraft from Puerto Rico, though one Airbus A300 owned by American Airlines was left behind for emergency use. Tourists left en masse on departing flights before the airport terminated operations. Cruise ships with San Juan as their port of call were rerouted elsewhere. One person was killed in Utuado, Puerto Rico, after being electrocuted by a power line while preparing for the storm. On September 18, Puerto Rican Governor Rafael Hernández Colón ordered a shutdown of the island&#x27;s electric grid to mitigate damage. A state of emergency was declared in the Dominican Republic on September 18.

Buildings were boarded up in Nassau, Bahamas, and classes were cancelled at The College of The Bahamas on September 18.

=== Continental United States ===

After Hugo departed the Caribbean, officials in South Florida convened on September 18 to discuss emergency preparedness plans, and some residents began to gather supplies. NHC director Bob Sheets stated that if Hugo were to reach the United States, it could move ashore &quot;anywhere from the Florida Keys to North Carolina.&quot; NASA delayed the September 22 launch of an Atlas-Centaur rocket with Hugo looming. Boats were moved from coastal marinas to more protected harbors inland near St. Simons, Georgia. The American Red Cross readied 58 shelters in Miami, Florida, and 23 shelters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Equipment was prepositioned throughout Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to expedite cleanup operations. The mayor of Charleston, Joseph P. Riley Jr., called Hugo &quot;an extraordinarily dangerous event, [...] the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced.&quot; Twenty U.S. Navy ships and submarines were moved out of Charleston to weather the storm at sea. The New Georgia Railroad between Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia, halted operations, affecting 400 passengers.

The hurricane watch for the Carolinas was issued 30 hours before Hugo&#x27;s landfall. Charleston County, South Carolina, officials began recommending evacuations on the evening of September 20; this was later changed to an evacuation order. Beaufort County, South Carolina, declared a state of emergency on September 20 and implemented voluntary evacuations. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., the Governor of South Carolina, issued a voluntary evacuation order before the coast was placed under a hurricane warning, with the initial directive intended for barrier islands, beaches, and peninsulas outside Charleston. This was later supplanted by a mandatory evacuation order. Governor Campbell ordered eight coastal counties to open shelters; of these shelters, 20 were opened in Charleston County. Four hundred troops from the National Guard were activated to assist in evacuations along the coast. A total of 264,000 people were evacuated in South Carolina; most took shelter in the homes of friends or relatives, and relatively few sought refuge in public shelters. A fifth of evacuees took refuge within 30 minutes of their homes. An estimated 96 percent of people on the high-risk barrier islands and beaches evacuated, while 75–80 percent of people in moderate-risk areas evacuated. Most did not evacuate until after the hurricane warning and mandatory evacuation order were issued. Accurate forecasts from the NHC and the resulting narrow scope of evacuations allowed the evacuations to &quot;[proceed] as smoothly as could be expected&quot;, and contraflow traffic patterns were not required for those departing Charleston via Interstate 26. Parts of the Georgia and North Carolina coasts also evacuated ahead of Hugo. Georgia enacted a full evacuation, with 175,000 leaving their homes and 6,000 moving to public shelters. Civil authorities in Glynn County, Georgia, urged the 15,000 residents along barrier islands to begin evacuating on the morning of September 21 ahead of hurricane warnings. Public schools were closed in Chatham County, Georgia, to allocate school buses for the evacuation of barrier islands. Three shelters were opened in North Carolina, though emergency management did not anticipate ordering evacuations.

== Impact ==
=== Caribbean ===

Hugo was the strongest storm to traverse the northeastern Caribbean since Hurricane David in 1979. The Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model estimated that storm surge from Hugo led to coastal water levels above normal tidal heights along Saint Croix and the eastern end of Puerto Rico. These equated to storm surge heights of around . Water levels of above normal were estimated to have occurred along the northern coast of Puerto Rico. Rainfall on the Caribbean islands averaged between . The NHC&#x27;s preliminary report on the hurricane enumerated 28 fatalities in the eastern Caribbean while media reports tallied over 30. As many as 100,000 people may have been left homeless throughout the region as a result of Hugo.

Guadeloupe and Montserrat were hardest-hit among the Leeward Islands, and collectively suffered over $1 billion in damage and recorded 21 fatalities. Though less severe, widespread damage was also inflicted by Hugo across the remainder of the Leeward and Windward Islands. Extensive flooding occurred on Antigua, and power outages befell the island after utility poles were uprooted by the storm. There were 2 deaths and 181 injuries. Another 509 people were left homeless following damage wrought to 15 percent of homes. Partial damage was documented on 1,500 homes and total loss was documented on 106. Thirty percent of fishing vessels were also damaged by the hurricane, equating to thousands of boats. The total cost of damage reached nearly EC$200 million. Hugo&#x27;s damage toll in Saint Kitts and Nevis amounted to $46 million, largely sustained by shoreline structures and crops. This equated to 32 percent of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product. Homes, government buildings, and trees were damaged by the storm. A fifth of the country was rendered homeless and the entire populace lost power and water. Ninety percent of the residents of Nevis lost their homes. One person was killed after a wall collapsed upon him.

Dominica was most affected among the Windward Islands. Hugo ruined 80 percent of the island&#x27;s banana crop and interrupted water supplies. Coastal roads were damaged by the hurricane&#x27;s choppy seas; a washout along a primary thoroughfare isolated the village of Dubique. Bridges and storm drains also took heavy damage. Landslides isolated towns for many days. The damage toll in Dominica totaled $20 million.

The hurricane moved near the Virgin Islands and made two landfalls in Puerto Rico as it egressed the Caribbean, causing considerable destruction. Estimates of the damage toll in this region vary but include over $50 million each for the British Virgin Islands and Netherlands Antilles, $2 billion for Puerto Rico, and $500 million for Saint Croix. Hugo&#x27;s center was southwest of Sint Maarten at its closest approach; a station there reported a maximum sustained wind and a peak gust of . Eleven people were killed in the Netherlands Antilles and caused $50 million in damage there. The damage toll in the British Virgin Islands exceeded $50 million, with the loss of at least half of the islands&#x27; agriculture. Around 30 percent of homes were unroofed. Power outages affected the British Virgin Islands. The Associated Press reported &quot;numerous injuries&quot; and &quot;scores of homes destroyed&quot; on Tortola, the largest island in the BVI. A third of the island&#x27;s private homes were wrecked. The hurricane also caused widespread power outages in the Dominican Republic while tracking northwest towards the continental United States.
=== Contiguous United States ===
Hugo was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history at the time and one of its costliest disasters overall, with a damage toll of $8 billion estimated by the NHC. This total was over three times higher than that inflicted by Hurricane Frederic, the previous costliest hurricane. &quot;The State&quot;, a South Carolina newspaper, estimated that the U.S. incurred $8.671 billion in damage from Hugo, with $7.071 billion in the contiguous U.S. and $1.6 billion in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. &quot;The San Juan Star&quot;, a Puerto Rican newspaper, calculated that losses in Puerto Rico amounted to $2 billion. Insured property damage in the contiguous U.S. reached $3.042 billion according to the American Insurance Association, with another $1.881 billion in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Although the most heavily impacted areas had relatively low population, Hugo moved over heavily forested areas; this was unusual for a hurricane striking the United States, and led to significant secondary damage from falling trees. Hugo was also the most powerful storm to strike the country since Hurricane Camille in 1969.

In addition to the rain, surge, and wind associated with Hugo, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center received unconfirmed reports of tornadoes produced by Hugo in South Carolina and west-central North Carolina, though it was difficult to differentiate tornadic damage from the broader-swaths of wind damage caused by the hurricane. There were 26 fatalities in the United States attributed directly to the weather conditions produced by Hugo; among the country&#x27;s states and territories, South Carolina had the highest death toll with 13 direct fatalities. The American Red Cross enumerated 70 fatalities in the Carolinas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands both directly and indirectly caused by Hugo. The homes of more than 200,000 families nationwide were damaged or destroyed; 129,687 families were affected in the Carolinas and 87,700 families were affected in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

==== South Carolina ====

The eye of Hugo moved ashore South Carolina at Sullivan&#x27;s Island at 04:00 UTC on September 22 (12:00 a.m. EDT). The storm&#x27;s maximum sustained winds were estimated by the NHC to have reached during landfall, making Hugo a Category 4 hurricane. This estimate was derived from an aircraft reconnaissance flight into the storm shortly before landfall; no weather stations were positioned along Bulls Bay, where Hugo&#x27;s strongest winds likely occurred. This intensity made Hugo the strongest hurricane to strike the United States in 20 years. The ship &quot;Snow Goose&quot;, anchored in the Sampit River west of Georgetown, clocked a 120-mile-per-hour (193 km/h) sustained wind using an anemometer mounted on the ship&#x27;s mast. In downtown Charleston, a sustained wind of and a gust of were reported. Hugo produced an storm surge at Charleston, indicating that water levels rose above mean lower low water as Hugo made landfall. Elsewhere along the South Carolina coast, Hugo produced storm tides as high as . The maximum recorded storm surge was along Seewee Bay south of McClellanville. This rise in water induced by Hugo resulted in the highest storm tides ever recorded along the U.S. East Coast. Between of rain fell across a swath wide over South Carolina. The maximum rainfall in the state (and the continental United States) was as measured in Edisto Island. Totals between were commonplace along the coast of South Carolina.
The South Carolina Electric and Gas Company (SCE&amp;G) called Hugo &quot;the single greatest natural disaster ever to strike the state&quot;, inflicting $5.9 billion in property damage. The hurricane&#x27;s trajectory swept across three major South Carolina cities. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s &quot;Storm Data&quot; publication, there were 35 deaths associated with Hugo in South Carolina. The hurricane&#x27;s forces killed 13 people while another 22 fatalities were considered &quot;indirectly-related&quot;. Among the indirect fatalities were two people killed by house fires started by candles during the storm. Another 420 people were injured throughout the state. The Red Cross documented the destruction of 3,307 single-family homes and &quot;major damage&quot; to another 18,171. Across eight counties, manufacturers incurred $158 million in damage to factories and $750 million in inventory and income losses. Much of the South Carolina coast was subject to the ferocity of the hurricane&#x27;s forces. Hugo&#x27;s storm surge wrecked the barrier islands, thoroughly razing many structures. Many homes on Wadmalaw Island and Johns Island were crushed by fallen trees. The Ben Sawyer Bridge connecting the South Carolina mainland to Sullivan&#x27;s Island was heavily damaged and became stuck in an open position. Rows of beachfront homes on Sullivan&#x27;s Island were razed by the surge. Ships at the marina in Isle of Palms were crumpled into a heap on the mainland shore. Beach homes on Isle of Palms were moved off their foundations by an storm surge; in total, 60 homes were destroyed on the island. The damage in Sullivan&#x27;s Island and Isle of Palms combined was estimated to be approximately $270 million. Every building on the two islands took damage from the hurricane. Storm surge tore off the pavement from coastal roads and destroyed 80 percent at Folly Beach. All coastal state parks with the exception of Hunting Island and Edisto Beach sustained significant damage.
Charleston County was at the epicenter of Hugo&#x27;s devastation. At McClellanville, near the point of maximum storm surge, shrimp boats were pushed as far as inland. Commercial and recreational craft damaged other structures as they were carried ashore. A high school used as a shelter for 1,125 local residents was inundated by the ocean&#x27;s advance; documentation had listed its elevation too high, leading to its mistaken selection as a shelter. The storm surge accumulated within the Ashley, Cooper, and Santee rivers, forcing them over their banks and submerging low-lying areas upstream. One person was killed by the rise of the Cooper River at Mount Pleasant. Seven to eight hundred boats were left in derelict condition, and many in Shem Creek capsized. Hugo&#x27;s surge spilled over The Battery and overtook the first floors of homes in downtown Charleston. Eighty percent of roofs in the city were damaged, with many already susceptible to strong winds due to poor maintenance and weak structural integrity. At least 3,200 historic structures in Charleston were damaged and 95 percent of urban trees were lost. Naval Weapons Station Charleston sustained $95–$100 million in damage. Two people were killed in Charleston by the collapse of their homes. The U.S. Route 17 bridge across Awendaw Creek in Awendaw was destroyed by a storm tide. Extensive losses to timber occurred at Francis Marion National Forest, where 75 percent of marketable trees were felled. Most trees were truncated above the ground, with others snapped or uprooted; the cost of damage was estimated by the U.S. Forest Service at between $95 and 115 million. Animals, including some from endangered species, were killed at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge. However, the lack of infrastructure near the refuge significantly reduced the damage wrought by Hugo&#x27;s strongest winds.
Coastal impacts in South Carolina were extensive beyond Charleston County. The waterfront in Georgetown suffered heavily, with the destruction of 150 homes. Major damage was inflicted upon 350 homes and minor damage was inflicted upon another 500 homes, with their aggregate losses amounting to $87 million. Farms and businesses around Georgetown sustained $10 million in damage. Only a few beachfront homes withstood the hurricane in Pawleys Island. Debris from destroyed homes piled atop streets along the island&#x27;s south end. Hugo caused about $944 million in damage in Horry County. As protective sand dunes were whittled down by the hurricane, beaches along of the coastal Carolinas recessed inland. Beaches were eroded by a surge up to the most outward row of homes in Garden City. These coastal homes were razed or washed inland, dealing damage to additional homes. M. L. Love, the administrator for Horry County, said that the city &quot;for all practical purposes is gone.&quot; Severe beach erosion also occurred in Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach. Piers along the coast of Horry County were heavily damaged by storm surge. The pier at Sunset Beach was reduced to its pilings. Myrtle Beach Air Force Base sustained $2 million in damage from buildings and equipment. With the Grand Strand and Myrtle Beach areas experiencing only low-end hurricane-force winds, the widespread wind damage in those areas was attributed to &quot;widespread underdesign and marginal building practices.&quot; Lesser damage occurred along the southern South Carolina coast between Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, with winds there remaining below .

Hugo&#x27;s acceleration at landfall allowed strong winds to penetrate well inland, causing widespread wind damage across the eastern two-thirds of the state. The NOAA classified wind damage as &quot;extensive&quot; in 15 counties. Devastated groves of pine trees were characteristic of the hurricane&#x27;s impacts, in addition to numerous unroofed homes and cotton crops injured by the winds and rain. Over one-third of all timber in the state was damaged, with the damage most extensive near the coast and locations that were northeast of Hugo&#x27;s eye as it moved across the state. This quantity of timber was enough to build 660,000 homes. The total stock of growing softwood was cut by 21 percent while the total stock of growing hardwood fell by 6 percent. Hugo was widely considered the most significant forest disaster in South Carolina history. Across 23 counties, 4.4 million acres (1.8 million hectares) experienced the loss of 6.6 million board feet (15,600 m3) of timber, equivalent to three to four times the annual timber harvest; this was a greater loss of timber than observed in Hurricane Camille, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, and the Yellowstone fires of 1988, combined. Berkeley, Clarendon, Florence, Lee, Sumter, and Williamsburg counties each experienced damage to more than 90 percent of timberland. A conservative estimate valued the lost timber statewide at $1.04 billion. Downed trees and wind-blown debris severed power lines, cutting power for most areas. Three power plants were also disabled by the storm. SCE&amp;G reported that 300,000 of its electricity customers lost power, with a complete loss of power east of Interstate 95. Utility services from the South Carolina Public Service Authority were crippled for 99 percent of the utility&#x27;s customers. At Shaw Air Force Base near Sumter, 200 homes were destroyed and 1,000 sustained heavy damage; the property damage toll for Sumter County was $237 million. The effects of Hugo in the Carolinas were most fatal in Berkeley County, where eight people were killed. Over a thousand homes and apartments were destroyed and 70–80 percent of the county&#x27;s trees were blown down. Up to a quarter of York County&#x27;s cotton crop was lost, with additional losses suffered by peach, sorghum, and soybean crops.

==== North Carolina ====

Across North Carolina, Hugo damaged 2,638 structures and destroyed 205; the damage toll was $1 billion. Losses to crops and livestock amounted to nearly $97 million. There were seven fatalities in the state. Storm surge along the coast of North Carolina west of Cape Fear reached above mean sea level. Three beach communities in Brunswick County, North Carolina, incurred a total of $55 million in damage; with at least 25 beachfront homes battered by the storm; another 100 structures were threatened by coastal erosion. Along parts of the coast, of beach eroded, including sand dunes that once stood tall. Sixty percent of the sand dunes in Long Beach were eliminated by the hurricane, further exposing areas inland to the storm&#x27;s fury. Several piers were wrecked by Hugo: the pier at Yaupon Beach was destroyed while a fourth of the pier at Long Beach was lost; the end of the pier at Holden Beach also succumbed to the storm.

With the aid of Hugo&#x27;s rapid forward motion, the swath of damaging winds produced by Hugo in interior South Carolina penetrated into western North Carolina while still a category 1 hurricane and brought extensive damage to areas that rarely experienced impacts from tropical cyclones. Hugo produced a nearly corridor of downed trees and power lines west of Charlotte, and hurricane-force wind gusts extended inland. The control tower at Charlotte Douglas International Airport clocked a gust, forcing personnel in the airport&#x27;s control tower to evacuate. Windows were blown out of skyscrapers in Downtown Charlotte. The tall WSOC-TV antenna collapsed onto the television station below. Numerous trees in Charlotte were also blown down atop homes and power lines, triggering long-lasting power outages that affected 85 percent of Charlotte homes and businesses. A six-month-old boy was killed after a tree toppled onto his mobile home; another 15 people were injured, primarily by falling trees. The winds piled boats together and destroyed or damaged thousands of them in Lake Norman, located north of Charlotte. Wind damage in Mecklenburg County amounted to over $500 million. Millions of trees were felled across the Foothills and Piedmont of North Carolina; some areas endured the resulting power outages for weeks. The National Weather Service office in Wilmington described Hugo&#x27;s winds as a &quot;unique event in weather history for this portion of inland North Carolina.&quot;

==== Virginia ====

Parts of Southwest Virginia were also impacted by the core of strong winds associated with Hugo, which passed through the state as a tropical storm. Bath and Bland counties registered 81-mph (130 km/h) gusts; these were the fastest gusts measured in Virginia in connection with the passing storm. As was the case in North Carolina, the winds downed numerous trees, causing widespread power outages and structural damage. Their arboreal debris obstructed hundreds of roads. Sporadic damage from Hugo occurred as far east as Interstate 95. The damage toll in Virginia was approximately $60 million, with over $40 million incurred in Carroll and Grayson County, Virginia counties; six people were killed statewide.

While Hugo&#x27;s quick traversal of the Southeastern U.S. enlarged the area of inland wind damage, it also attenuated rainfall totals; rainfall was relatively light for a storm of Hugo&#x27;s size. In southwestern Virginia and western North Carolina, the topography of the Appalachian Mountains led to a localized area of heavier rainfalls, resulting in rainfall totals. While Hugo&#x27;s rainfall was not sufficient to cause major river flooding in North Carolina, minor flooding impacted mountainous areas north and east of Asheville and highways in seven counties. A nursing home in Boone, North Carolina, was evacuated following a flash flood. In Burnsville, North Carolina, flooding prompted the evacuation of 79 prisoners. Rainfall totals of occurred throughout southwestern Virginia, with a maximum of in Hillsville, Virginia. Some low-lying areas and streams flooded, including the New and Roanoke rivers; flooding along the South Fork of the Roanoke forced about 60 people to evacuate.

==== Elsewhere ====

Strong winds in Georgia downed trees in four counties, damaging homes and power lines. About 50–75 trees were toppled around Savannah, where wind gusts reached . The city&#x27;s weather service office recorded of rain. Winds of downed trees in Mercer County, West Virginia. Flooding forced the evacuation of the Oakdale area in Harrison County, West Virginia. Widespread flash flooding occurred across eastern Tennessee, forcing the evacuation of people from affected areas; some of the evacuees had fled South Carolina for the Great Smoky Mountains. Three hundred people were driven out of Carter County. Floods there swamped homes and the downtown area of Roan Mountain. Bridges and roads were washed out in Greene and Johnson counties. Numerous creeks overflowed their banks in northeastern Ohio following heavy rainfall from the remnants of Hugo on the afternoon of September 22. In both Chardon and Medina, of rain fell in two hours. Floodwaters inundated urban areas and basements. In the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, flooding overtook cars and buses. High water and washouts forced the closure of U.S. Route 42 and Ohio State Route 94 in Medina County.

The juxtaposition of Hugo&#x27;s extratropical remnants (a low-pressure system) over the eastern Great Lakes region and a strong high-pressure system off the U.S. East Coast generated a sharp contrast in pressure. This led to strong winds over the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. Nearly 85,000 homes and businesses lost power on Long Island. One person was killed in Norwich, New York, after a falling tree struck the car he was in. Fifteen counties in Pennsylvania reported high winds in connection with Hugo, with some sustaining damage to trees. Connecticut was buffeted with winds of , blowing down some trees and branches. This led to scattered and brief power outages that affected 30,000 electricity customers. Total property and crop damage in Connecticut amounted to at least $50,000. Power outages also affected thousands of electricity customers in Massachusetts. Fallen trees and broken limbs caused scattered property damage throughout the state. In western parts of Massachusetts, some apple orchards reported damage to as much as 30 percent of their crops. In Vermont, the high winds generated swells several feet high on Lake Champlain, freeing some boats from their moorings. Trees and power lines were also brought down by the winds statewide.

===Canada===
After becoming extratropical, the remnants of Hugo entered Canada into the province of Ontario. In the Niagara Falls area, winds between were reported. Winds near were also reported in Toronto. Heavy rainfall also occurred in Ontario, with precipitation in Ontario peaking at , while a maximum amount of was reported in Toronto. As a result of the storm, blackouts and car accidents were reported in Toronto. Furthermore, heavy rains and high winds also occurred across the southern portions of Ontario.

The remnants of Hugo tracked northeastward and entered the Canadian province of Quebec. In Montreal, rainfall reached only , while precipitation amounts in the province peaked at . In addition to light rain, high winds were reported in the province. Winds in Montreal gusted up to , leaving 13,400 homes without electricity. 7,400 residence in Verdun and West Island also lost electricity when tree fell on power lines; it was restored about 12 hours later. While in Brossard and Chambly, power was lost to 5,000 homes and 1,000 homes in Valleyfield. In addition, high winds and heavy rainfall also occurred in the St. Lawrence River Valley.

Similar effects were reported in New Brunswick, though little rainfall occurred in the province. Winds gusting to was reported in Moncton. As a result of high winds, power poles were toppled and tree branches fell, which caused most of New Brunswick&#x27;s 15,000 power failures. In addition, several tree and signs were blown over in Saint John and Moncton. The storm also significantly affected the apple crop in New Brunswick. Strong winds were also reported in Newfoundland, with gusts recorded up to .

=== Caribbean ===
==== Lesser Antilles ====
A plane bearing 60 rescue workers and emergency supplies was sent to Guadeloupe from Paris on September 19, with two more relief aircraft held on standby. The crews were tasked with sheltering the homeless, restoring electricity service, and clearing roads. Doctors were also sent to Guadeloupe from La Meynard Hospital in Martinique. Emergency supplies from Paris were gathered by Catholic Air and Red Cross. Military aircraft delivered 50 tons (45 tonnes) of supplies and over 500 emergency workers to Guadeloupe, along with Minister of Overseas France Louis Le Pensec; 3,000 soldiers also accompanied the transport. The total cost of repairs on the island was estimated at over €610 million. Two days after Hugo&#x27;s passage, an Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma rescue helicopter crashed in La Désirade, killing nine people. The Guadeloupe government held a competition to design homes that would be quickly built to house the island&#x27;s homeless population; five of thirty models were selected, and the first homes were built five months after Hugo. The banana industry in Guadeloupe required FF466 million to recover, while the island&#x27;s hotel industry suffered FF152 million in losses.

The emergency operations center in Montserrat was formally activated on September 18 to effectively deal with the aftermath of Hugo. As more robust communication systems were destroyed by the storm, communications between the island and the outside world were primarily handled by amateur radio. Urgent requests for aid were forwarded by ham radio operators to all embassies and foreign missions in Barbados. The island&#x27;s reduced radio capabilities were augmented by when she arrived in Plymouth on September 18. The ship also brought a helicopter and a crew of 100 sailors that aided in cleaning up roads between Plymouth and W. H. Bramble Airport. Extensive effort was required to clean up Montserrat&#x27;s roads due to the prevalence of debris. Along with the crew of the &quot;Alacrity&quot;, the Barbados Defence Force and Jamaica Defence Force also assisted in road cleanup operations in Montserrat. The International Rescue Corps maintained a satellite communications link and provided support for 21 national and international organizations in recovery efforts. Rationing on petroleum was enforced, with a limit of four gallons (15 liters) per person. Waterborne illnesses in Hugo&#x27;s aftermath proved fatal in Montserrat. A temporary hospital was established at the Montserrat Government House following the destruction of a recently completed hospital.

==== United States Virgin Islands ====

President Bush declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. A temporary air traffic control tower was erected at Alexander Hamilton Airport in Saint Croix six days after the storm. Cyril E. King Airport in Saint Thomas, having suffered less damage, resumed operations within 24 hours. Power was restored in most of Saint Croix and Saint Thomas within three months. The islands&#x27; telephone systems were badly crippled by the storm, and only limited service was restored to businesses in December 1989. Some private residences in Saint Croix remained without telephone service until March 1990. Between 300 and 500 prisoners were freed from prison in Saint Croix after the storm, either by escaping or by release due to food and water shortages in the prison. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dispatched a C-141 airlifter with government relief workers and communications equipment to Saint Croix. The demographics of the Virgin Islands a year after Hugo reflected the hurricane&#x27;s impact: roughly 10% of Saint Croix&#x27;s populace did not return to the island within a year of Hugo. A smaller exodus occurred at Saint Thomas and Saint John.

Three days after the storm hit, the Governor of the United States Virgin Islands Alexander Farrelly asked President Bush for federal assistance in restoring order to the island. On the island of Saint Croix, looting and lawlessness reigned in the aftermath of Hugo. FBI agents, U.S. marshals, and local police initially maintained a patrol of Frederiksted and Christiansted while the U.S. Coast Guard evacuated tourists from the island; the USCGC Bear evacuated 40 people and sent personnel onshore to monitor the situation. However, local law enforcement in Saint Croix was unable to stop widespread looting, with armed gangs reportedly taking root the streets of Christiansted. &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; reported that some members of the local police and National Guard also took part in looting. For the first time since the Baltimore riot of 1968, American troops were deployed in response to a domestic civil disturbance; with the authorization of U.S. President George H. W. Bush under the Insurrection Act of 1807, the Pentagon sent 1,100 troops and federal marshals to augment the security presence as local police and the National Guard lost control of the situation. Among the deployments were 470 troops from the 16th Military Police Brigade, 560 troops from the 503rd Military Police Battalion, and three helicopters and medical support. Dubbed Operation Hawkeye, the operation involved elements of the Army, Navy and the Coast Guard, along with a contingent from the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI, forming Joint Task Force (JTF) 40 for Operation Hawkeye. It also resulted in the first operational deployment of the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), when the New Mexico-1 Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) was deployed to assist in medical care needs of the stricken island. The first contingent arrived in Saint Croix on the morning of September 21 to secure an airfield and devise the command structure for the other arriving troops.

National Basketball Association player Tim Duncan, born in Christiansted and a two-time NBA MVP, of the San Antonio Spurs attributed his basketball career to Hurricane Hugo&#x27;s destruction. When Tim was 13 years old, he was a competitive swimmer who was considered one of the top United States competitors for the 400-meter freestyle. However, in the aftermath of Hugo, every swimming pool on Saint Croix was destroyed, including the Olympic-size swimming pool. With no pool to practice in, Duncan turned to basketball. Tim Duncan said, &quot;I&#x27;m very fortunate to be where I am today. Without Hugo, I might still be swimming.&quot; On April 4, 2020, it was announced that Duncan would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 29.

==== Puerto Rico ====
Puerto Rican Governor Hernandez Colón solicited a disaster declaration for Puerto Rico from President Bush after surveying the damage wrought by Hugo. The U.S. Department of the Interior allocated $500,000 in aid to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Police were dispatched to retail areas, offices of political parties, and the main San Juan post office to avert looting. An emergency clinic served in place of the destroyed hospital in Culebra. Governor Colón estimated that the number of those displaced by Hugo in Puerto Rico exceeded 50,000. Over 25,000 people in Culebra and Vieques remained in shelters after Hugo as their homes were destroyed. The Puerto Rican school system was hindered by the damage inflicted on the schools themselves, their use as shelters, and the loss of water and power service. Due to a lack of planning for housing shelter residents, 500 schools remained closed weeks after the storm, affecting at least 150,000 students. The loss of water caused two hospitals to refuse patient admission on September 20.

While power in San Juan was largely restored within 48 hours, many in Puerto Rico remained without power in the days following Hugo. On September 24, 47,500 businesses and homes in Puerto Rico were without power; the &quot;San Juan Star&quot; reported that a quarter of electricity customers in Fajardo remained without electric service on October 9, three weeks after Hugo struck the island. Residents of Puerto Rico&#x27;s northeastern coast were encouraged to boil water to curtail the spread of food- and waterborne diseases, though power outages prevented most from doing so. Repair costs for Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority poles and wires amounted to $50 million; some repair efforts may have been undermined by the looting of copper wire in Hugo&#x27;s aftermath. At least six workers were killed while repairing power lines. Equipment from the continental U.S. for the restoration of Puerto Rican water supplies arrived beginning on September 22, with the capacity to produce over 200,000 gallons (760,000 liters) of potable water daily. USAF sent power generators, plastic sheeting for repairs, and 200,000  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers distributed over 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) of water using 33 tank trucks, with the costs subsidized by the U.S. government. U.S. Coast Guard C-130s and two cutters were sent to San Juan to render aid and deliver supplies. From its supply centers in the continental U.S., the American Red Cross amassed supplies for victims in Puerto Rico and mounted its largest domestic relief effort in four years.

=== Continental United States ===

An overnight curfew was enacted by Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. on September 22 while martial law was declared for Sullivan&#x27;s Island. A federal disaster area was declared for 24 counties in South Carolina. Federal resources for the aftermath in South Carolina were strained by earlier relief efforts for Hugo&#x27;s impact in the Caribbean; they would be strained further by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in October. The presence of debris on roads hampered relief efforts and increased recovery costs. In contrast with prior trends, more people were killed after the hurricane&#x27;s passage rather than due to the hurricane&#x27;s direct forces. Several members of repair crews were killed or injured in South Carolina and Puerto Rico from ungrounded portable generators. There were 24 deaths in the aftermath of Hugo in South Carolina. Five people died of heart attacks while surveying Hugo&#x27;s aftermath in Dorchester County. SCE&amp;G fully restored power to its customers in 18 days after deploying 4,703 personnel. The company also offered free bus service for a week and distributed dry ice to the public.

Between 15 and 20 thousand people were left homeless in Charleston County. Homes were primarily rebuilt and repaired by non-profit and ad-hoc groups. Churches and other private non-profit groups managed replacement housing for Hugo victims in at least four South Carolina counties whose governments lacked such capabilities. Temporary housing assistance was extended to 30,000 storm victims in the state by the FEMA at a cost of $31 million. In addition to those offered housing grants, 243 families were moved to FEMA mobile homes beginning a week after Hugo until April 1990. State and local governments together contributed $8.25 million to public assistance projects. After the storm, Governor Campbell said that the storm destroyed enough timber in South Carolina to &quot;frame a home for every family in the state of West Virginia.&quot; An immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for pulpwood before they deteriorated to the point where they could not be used. Still standing timber that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies, so they were also downgraded into pulpwood, leading to such a drop in pulpwood prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased. United States Senator from South Carolina Fritz Hollings referred to FEMA as &quot;a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses&quot; during a speech on the floor of the United States Senate. An investigation was launched, which led to some reforms in FEMA procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during Hurricane Andrew, the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the United States. The economy of South Carolina continued to grow after Hugo, though some sectors did not benefit from recovery efforts. There was a 14 percent increase in traffic accidents in Charleston in the wake of the hurricane. Delays in traffic in the city led to an estimated 35 percent increase in vehicular operating costs in the months following the hurricane.

=== Retirement ===
The devastation caused by Hugo led to the name being retired in the spring of 1990 by the World Meteorological Organization from the rotating lists of Atlantic hurricane names. It was replaced with the name &quot;Humberto&quot; when the 1989 naming list was used next in 1995.

=== Ecological aftermath ===

The defoliation of mangroves and the introduction of freshwater runoff into brackish waters created anoxic conditions that killed many fish in Guadeloupe&#x27;s mangrove habitats; fish populations would recover by January 1990. The low species richness of mangrove forests was found to a contributing factor to Hugo&#x27;s damage upon vegetation. Forests with a greater vertical extent and higher species richness were more protected from the hurricane&#x27;s effects. Bat populations in Montserrat dropped 20-fold in response to extensive habitat loss and community composition transitioned from one dominated by small frugivores to one dominated by larger frugivores and omnivores. Extensive defoliation was documented in the forests of Dominica, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico, where vegetation was stripped bare of their flowers, fruits, and leaves.

A survey of bird populations in Saint Croix observed that Hugo&#x27;s aftermath may have stressed birds more than the hurricane&#x27;s immediate meteorological forces. Frugivorous, nectarivorous, and seminivorous bird populations declined most among avian diet groups as a result of vegetation loss. The bridled quail-dove (&quot;Geotrygon mystacea&quot;) was driven out of its traditional habitats on Saint Croix. Declines in the populations of certain bird species were also noted in Saint John. The destruction of habitats forced the relocation of some avian species such as the pearly-eyed thrasher (&quot;Margarops fuscatus&quot;) and northern waterthrush (&quot;Seiurus noveboracensis&quot;). The populations or habitats of three endangered Puerto Rican birds were affected by Hugo: the Puerto Rican amazon (&quot;Amazona vittata&quot;), the Yellow-shouldered blackbird (&quot;Agelaius xanthomus&quot;), and the Puerto Rican plain pigeon (&quot;Columba inornata wetmorei&quot;). El Yunque National Forest lost 15 percent of its trees, valued at $5.2 million. However, the increased exposure to sunlight following the loss of tree canopies led to increased diversity of plant species. In Montserrat, the endemic Montserrat oriole (&quot;Icterus oberi&quot;) was driven out of the South Soufriere Hills after losing much of its habitat.

Sewage contamination and poor water quality briefly impacted shellfish populations along the coast of South Carolina. The turbulent action generated by Hugo in streams lowered concentrations of dissolved oxygen and increased concentrations of toxic phenols. Nekton communities suffered increased mortality in river channels and marsh creeks near the Charleston harbor due to hypoxia and lowered salinity in the water, though their populations recovered within two months. Increased salinization of coastal soil led to increased tree mortality and discoloration or defoliation of trees. These surge-battered forests were devoid of insects and terrestrial vertebrates for six months, though their populations were well-below pre-storm levels. Benthic invertebrates experienced a 97% decrease in population density but recovered to pre-storm levels in three months. At least 25 coastal species of birds were displaced as far as inland by the storm. Across the Carolinas, Hugo&#x27;s winds increased the quantity of downed brush, timber, and debris by up to 15 times their normal amounts, significantly increasing the risk of wildfires throughout the region. FEMA designated $7 million towards forest fire mitigation in Hugo&#x27;s aftermath.

<text>The Clumber Spaniel is a breed of dog of the spaniel type, developed in the United Kingdom. It is the largest of the spaniels, and comes in predominantly white with either lemon or orange markings. The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire where the breed was first developed. It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover. They are gentle and loyal, and can act aloof with strangers. They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages, including a constant shedding of its coat and snoring.

The history of the breed is uncertain prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various members of the British Royal Family, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.

== Description == 
=== Appearance ===
The Clumber Spaniel is the largest of the English spaniel breeds, and is long and heavy-bodied, standing only in height but weighing from . It is similar in shape to the smaller Sussex Spaniel. The Clumber has a heavy bone structure, has a massive &#x27;melting&#x27; head with a mournful and dopey expression, a square nose and muzzle, and large vine-leaf shaped ears. Freckles on the muzzle and front legs are common. Its coat is dense, weather-resistant, straight, and flat with feathering around the ears, belly and legs. Clumbers are predominantly white in colour with lemon, brown, or orange markings around the eyes, and at the base of the tail.

=== Temperament ===

Their temperament is described as gentle, loyal and affectionate, but dignified and aloof with strangers. They can appear to be a sedate breed and enjoy curling up on the couch, eating and sleeping.

Clumber Spaniels shed at a medium pace and require to be brushed and groomed frequently. Clumbers tend to drool because of their very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are especially curious and playful. The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry something most of the time; unfortunately this can lead to health issues as they may ingest the items. Clumber Spaniels have the tendency to be more reserved with other dogs, until they have warmed up to them.

The breed has been used to hunt pheasant and partridge, in both small packs and alone. It is well-suited for work in upland hunting in dense cover, and although the Clumber is rather slow in the field compared to other spaniels, it is a quiet worker with a fine nose and good stamina. The broad muzzle of the breed allows it to retrieve a variety of game. Clumber Spaniels can be very content indoors or out, but mostly wherever their owner is, is where they seem most pleased. Clumber Spaniels do not have a frequency to bark and are more considered companions in the home rather than a watch dog.

== Health ==

Because Clumber Spaniels are large boned and fast growing, they can suffer from temporary lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs and the dog may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.

In addition, Clumbers often have difficulties conceiving and giving birth, and may require caesarian sections. Some dogs may suffer from sensitivity to anaesthesia. The most common severe health conditions in the Clumber Spaniel are entropion/ectropion eye conditions, spinal disc herniation and hip dysplasia. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

=== Entropion/Ectropion ===
Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, commonly the lower lid. This in turn irritates the cornea of the eye and can cause visual impairment. It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels plus a variety of non spaniel breeds.

Ectropion is the outward rolling of the eyelid, which abnormally exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because of the increased exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter as well as the English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.

The treatment for ectropion varies depending on the severity of the condition. The only treatment for entropion is surgical, and may be delayed until the dog reaches adulthood as whilst a puppy the facial structures of the animal are still growing and changing. Dogs who have surgical correction for defects such as entropion or ectropion may not be exhibited in the show ring.

=== Spinal disc herniation ===

Spinal disc herniation occurs when the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog&#x27;s legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.

=== Hip dysplasia ===
Hip dysplasia is a hereditary condition which occurs in most dog breeds to some extent, according to scores from a 2001 UK Kennel Club scheme, the Clumber Spaniel has the second worst breed mean scores. Furthermore, a survey conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 45.7% of Clumber Spaniels tested were affected by the condition. Initial signs are usually first noted when the dog is between five and twelve months old, and may include a swaying hindleg gait, hindleg lameness, muscle wastage around the hindquarters, reluctance to and fatigue during exercise, inability to climb stairs or jump up. The dog can appear hunched up with an arched back, and in the very worst cases may wince with pain when moving its hindlegs. Medical treatment can vary from the administration of painkillers to surgical correction depending on the severity of the condition.

== History ==
The breed&#x27;s history is uncertain before the middle of the 19th century. One theory is that it originated in France, stating that the Duc de Noailles at the time of the French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. The theory goes, that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was bred with Basset Hounds, and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees. A second theory is that it is descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel, which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel.

What is certain is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s gamekeeper, William Mansell, is credited with their development and improvement. Prince Albert, the Prince consort of Queen Victoria, was a fancier and promoter of the breed, as was his son King Edward VII, who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The breed was shown in England from 1859 onward. They are referred to in Queen Victoria&#x27;s diary: on October 16, 1840, she wrote, &quot;Walked out directly after breakfast before Albert went to shoot. He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with us and we went into the Slopes, with such a funny old Gamekeeper, Walters, in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game. They are such dear, nice dogs.&quot;

Until the mid 19th century the breeding of the Clumber Spaniel was mostly restricted to the nobility. During World War I breeding was stopped entirely causing their numbers to decrease to a record low. In 1925, King George V re-developed a line of Clumbers in the Royal Kennel and were used in the fields in the Sandringham Estate.

Sh. Ch. Raycroft Socialite, bred by Rae Furness and owned by Ralph Dunne of County Cavan, Ireland, won the coveted honor of Best In Show at the 1991 Crufts Centenary Show.

The Clumber Spaniel is currently recognised as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the UK Kennel Club, which means it is a breed with fewer than 300 new registrations each year. Other spaniels recognised as such are the Field Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel and Sussex Spaniel.

=== Clumber Spaniels in North America ===
While the breed was not shown widely in the United States prior to the late 1960s, in 1844, Lieutenant Venables, an officer of the British regiment stationed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, introduced the Clumber Spaniel to North America. The first Clumber Spaniel listed in the AKC registry, recorded for the date of 1878 was Bustler, an orange and white dog owned by Benjamin Smith of Nova Scotia. The Clumber Spaniel became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1884.

The first Clumber Spaniel was entered in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1878. Champion Clussexx Country Sunrise (&quot;Brady&quot;), bred by Doug Johnson and owned by Richard and Judith Zaleski of Florida, became the only Clumber to win Best in Show there in 1996. Samantha, now a six year old retired competitor placed 1st in her category for Clumber Spaniels, and competed within Kaston Kennels home of the World Famous Vanitonia Show Kennel. She now resides in Lake Forest Il.

<text>&quot;Hail Grenada&quot; has been the national anthem of Grenada since independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The words are by Irva Merle Baptiste-Blackett (1924–2020), and the music is by Louis Arnold Masanto (born 1938). It formally replaced the Grenada National State Anthem, written and adopted in 1967.

== History ==
The anthem was written by schoolteacher Irva Merle Baptiste-Blackett. Also a music teacher, Baptiste-Blackett took part in the Independence Anthem Songwriting Competition in the early 1970s, with her submission being selected as the national anthem. During the 2009 Independence Celebrations, Baptiste-Blackett received Grenada&#x27;s Camerhogne Silver Award for her writing of the national anthem.

<doc id="278892" wikidata="Q646622" url="?curid=278892" title="Stand Ye Guamanians">
<text>Stand Ye Guamanians (), officially known as the Guam Hymn (), is the regional anthem of Guam. The original English lyrics and music were written and composed in 1919 by Ramon Manilisay Sablan. The lyrics were slightly modified by the U.S. government prior to official adoption in 1952. In 1974, Lagrimas Untalan translated the English lyrics into CHamoru, which were made official in 1989. The CHamoru version is more widely used today.

As a United States dependency, the official national anthem is still the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;, which is always played before the Guam Hymn on official occasions. The Guam Hymn, however, is played alone at international sports competitions.

==History==
The song was originally written in English and composed in 1919 by Ramon Manilisay Sablan (1901/02–1970), the first CHamoru medical doctor and a CHamoru rights activist. Sablan, who attended Oklahoma A&amp;M (now Oklahoma State University), was also a classically trained accomplished pianist and oboe player who also sat in the college orchestra&#x27;s first violin section. He received his medical degree from the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky.

A February 1934 article in the &quot;Guam Recorder&quot; noted that the song had been sung customarily &quot;for some years&quot; during daily flag exercises in schools, alternating each day alongside another composition beginning with the line &quot;All Hail to thee, our noble flag&quot;.

After World War II, the U.S. government modified the lyrics of the song, such as changing the word &quot;Chamorros&quot; to &quot;Guamanians&quot; in the first line, before officially adopting it as the territorial anthem of Guam on 2 May 1952. Despite this, the song practically disappeared from public consciousness and was no longer regularly sung by children as it had been prior to the war. However, at the turn of the 1970s, a noticeable decline in the transmission of the CHamoru language to children led to the song gaining more attention once again.

In 1974, amid a resurgence in pride at CHamoru language and culture, educator and politician Lagrimas Leon Guerrero Untalan (1911–1997) translated the song into CHamoru for Guam&#x27;s first bilingual CHamoru-language education program, known as (&quot;Children&#x27;s School&quot;), which taught CHamoru to young children in public schools. On 31 January 1989, the CHamoru lyrics were made official. On 27 November 1991, it became mandatory for students to sing the anthem in CHamoru at school.

<doc id="278895" wikidata="Q2143231" url="?curid=278895" title="Roosevelt Corollary">
<text>In the history of United States foreign policy, the Roosevelt Corollary was an addition to the Monroe Doctrine articulated by President Theodore Roosevelt in his 1904 State of the Union Address, largely as a consequence of the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903. The corollary states that the United States could intervene in the internal affairs of Latin American countries if they committed flagrant wrongdoings that &quot;loosened the ties of civilized society&quot;.

Roosevelt tied his policy to the Monroe Doctrine, and it was also consistent with his foreign policy included in his Big stick ideology. Roosevelt stated that in keeping with the Monroe Doctrine, the U.S. was justified in exercising &quot;international police power&quot; to put an end to chronic unrest or wrongdoing in the Western Hemisphere. President Herbert Hoover in 1930 endorsed the Clark Memorandum that repudiated the Roosevelt Corollary in favor of what was later called the Good Neighbor policy.

==Background==

The Roosevelt Corollary was articulated in the aftermath of the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903. In late 1902, Britain, Germany, and Italy imposed a naval blockade of several months against Venezuela after President Cipriano Castro refused to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by Europeans in a recent civil war. The dispute was referred to the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague, which concluded on 22 February 1904 that the blockading powers involved in the Venezuela crisis were entitled to preferential treatment in the payment of their claims. This left a number of other countries which did not take military action, including the United States, with no recourse. The U.S. disagreed with the outcome in principle and Roosevelt saw the need to take action politically. The Corollary went towards ensuring that U.S. interests abroad were protected from, in future, European powers using this ruling at The Hague as justification for military action and/or occupation in Central and Latin America.

There were many contributing factors to the assertion of the Roosevelt Corollary in 1904, including both physical events such as the Venezuelan crisis and mentalities that existed within the U.S. that shaped the foreign policy of the period. One such mentality was the existence of anti-European sentiment amongst Americans that built up during the Venezuelan crisis due to the preferential treatment that the International Court of Arbitration awarded the European powers. This contributed to the domestic political situation in which Roosevelt was shaping his Corollary, making the introduction of the corollary harder to sell to the American public, especially as few people had any true understanding of the importance of the U.S. in international affairs. Even the long-existing concept of Manifest destiny, which was commonly used during the expansion of the United States’ western frontier, came into play to build the Roosevelt Corollary. Manifest destiny by the early twentieth century had become an expression of American exceptionalism, whereby the U.S. had superior virtue and a duty to help ‘lesser’ states in their development. Roosevelt himself showed longer-lasting ideas of the U.S. being the police state for the Western Hemisphere than is seen simply in the Venezuelan crisis, with him asserting in his 1901 annual message that international police duty “must be performed for the sake of the welfare of mankind”. Therefore, the Roosevelt Corollary was largely shaped and created due to the ruling of the Venezuelan crisis, but there were still underlying and previously seen ideas and domestic mentalities that contributed to its form.

==Content of the Corollary==
The Roosevelt Corollary, or the ideas it contained regarding the U.S. becoming the policeman of the Western Hemisphere, were first articulated by Secretary of State Elihu Root in a speech on 20 May 1904, and expanded on in Roosevelt’s annual message to congress on 6 December 1904, as seen below:

While the Monroe Doctrine had been verbal and defensive in warning European powers to keep their hands off countries in the Americas, Roosevelt now changed this into an aggressive military “obligation” of the U.S. to intervene in Latin and Central America to maintain stability in these areas. Where the Monroe Doctrine had been asserted in the early nineteenth century when the European powers looked again to recolonize in the Western Hemisphere, the Roosevelt Corollary nearly a century later looked to once again promote the U.S. in Central and Latin America. The Corollary contributed the United States’ transition into a great world power after the Spanish–American War, which largely marked the start of the U.S. expanding its interest in states beyond its own borders, promoting its influence and ideas abroad. By expanding on the Monroe Doctrine, rather than creating a whole new policy, Roosevelt was able to justify more easily the U.S. exercising “international police power” to put an end to wrongdoing in the Western Hemisphere as a more limited version of the Corollary already existed in the Monroe Doctrine, despite the shift from verbal to active intervention in Central and Latin America. 

==Use==

Though the Roosevelt Corollary was an addition to the Monroe Doctrine, it could also be seen as a departure. While the Monroe Doctrine stated that European countries should stay out of Latin America, the Roosevelt Corollary took this further to say the United States had the right to exercise military force in Latin American countries to keep European countries out. Historian Walter LaFeber wrote:
===Dominican Republic===
U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic is generally seen as the first true use of the Roosevelt Corollary. The case arose due to the San Domingo Improvement Company (SDIC), a New York company, taking over the Dominican Republic’s finances in 1893. This brought the interests of the U.S. and Dominican Republic closer together and so, when in 1897 the SDIC defaulted on its payments to European bondholders, the Dominican Republic fell into economic disaster, leading to the U.S. calling for arbitration on the case. The arbitration established a payment schedule from the Dominican to the SDIC, with the U.S. being able to collect the money from the Dominican Republic for the SDIC if it failed to pay, thereby expanding U.S. interests in the Dominican even further. The U.S. did end up having to become involved in debt collection from the Dominican Republic when they defaulted on payments and European powers threatened to intervene should the U.S. not. In 1905, the U.S. sent in warships and demanded the customs house be turned over to U.S. negotiators, who used proceeds to pay foreign creditors. 

The case exemplifies the power that the U.S. were able to exert in the Americas as a result of the Roosevelt Corollary, with them taking action to prevent European powers becoming involved in debt collection via their usual methods, such as blockades. It gave the U.S. an advantage as they were able to control the internal situations of countries, including the Dominican Republic, to their benefit, even if this meant European powers waiting longer for their repayments. This model—in which U.S. advisors worked to stabilize Latin American nations through temporary protectorates, staving off European action—became known as &quot;dollar diplomacy&quot;. The Dominican experiment, like most other &quot;dollar diplomacy&quot; arrangements, proved temporary and untenable, and the United States launched a larger military intervention in 1916 that lasted to 1924.

===Other areas===
U.S. presidents also cited the Roosevelt Corollary as justification for intervention in Cuba (1906–1909), Nicaragua (1909–1910, 1912–1925, and 1926–1933), Haiti (1915–1934), and the Dominican Republic (1916–1924). Although the main rationale for the corollary was to keep Europe from meddling in the Western Hemisphere, other intentions were hidden to retain the United States&#x27; reputation. Many other benefits such as the acquisition of raw materials and new markets attracted Roosevelt. These gains can be seen in the copious amount of sugar in Cuba or the abundant oil in Nicaragua.

==Shift to the &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; policy==

In 1928, President Calvin Coolidge issued the Clark Memorandum, often seen as a partial repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary, which stated that the U.S. did not have the right to intervene when there was a threat by European powers. President Herbert Hoover also helped to move the U.S. away from the imperialist tendencies of the Roosevelt Corollary by embarking on good-will tours, withdrawing troops from Nicaragua and Haiti, and abstaining from intervening in the internal affairs of neighboring countries.

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt further renounced interventionism and established his &quot;Good Neighbor policy&quot; that led to the annulment of the Platt Amendment by the Treaty of Relations with Cuba in 1934, and the negotiation of compensation for Mexico&#x27;s nationalization of foreign-owned oil assets in 1938. Indeed, leaving unchallenged the emergence of dictatorships like that of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua, and François Duvalier in Haiti were each considered to be &quot;Frankenstein dictators&quot; due to the mishandlings of the American occupations in the countries.

The era of the Good Neighbor policy ended with the start of the Cold War in 1945, as the U.S. felt there was a greater need to protect the Western Hemisphere from Soviet influence.

In 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles invoked the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corollary at the Tenth Pan-American Conference in Caracas, denouncing the intervention of Soviet communism in Guatemala. This was used to justify Operation PBSuccess that deposed President Jacobo Árbenz and installed a military dictatorship under Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of military dictators in the country.

==Historians&#x27; perspectives==
Historians Cyrus Veeser and Matthias Maass present a positive view of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Veeser sees it as a part of the transition into the progressive era of American politics, with Roosevelt working towards combining U.S. foreign policy goals with private economic activity abroad, as seen with the SDIC in the Dominican Republic. He also uses the ideas of David Pletcher to back his ideas, showcasing the role that the Roosevelt Corollary played in transforming American foreign policy from the &quot;uncertainty&quot; and &quot;improvisation&quot; seen in the late nineteenth century to the &quot;executive-driven, interventionist strategies&quot; of the early twentieth century. This shift aided the U.S. in their goal for becoming a global power. Maass is equally complimentary of the role played by the Roosevelt Corollary, which he sees as being an updated version of the Monroe Doctrine suited to the modern circumstances of global imperialism. Although he acknowledges that it wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion, the political, economic, and military climate in the Americas at the beginning of the twentieth century made a declaration from the U.S. vital if they were to become the main police power of the Western Hemisphere and ward off European intervention in what they deemed their territory. 

Critics, such as American professor and linguist Noam Chomsky, lie in-between the positive interpretations and avid opposers of the Roosevelt Corollary. He argues that the Roosevelt Corollary was merely a more explicit imperialist threat, building on the Monroe Doctrine, indicating that the U.S. would not only intervene in defense of South America in the face of European imperialism but also use its muscle to obtain concessions and privileges for American corporations, giving a more balanced view of an advanced Monroe Doctrine that was able to benefit the U.S. in their hemisphere. 

There are obvious differences between the Monroe Doctrine, which focused on defense of the Americas, and the Roosevelt Corollary that asserted U.S. power and ensured they were able to advance their own goals for U.S. gain. Historian Serge Ricard of the University of Paris argues that these differences are significant and that the Roosevelt Corollary did not simply escalate the Monroe Doctrine. Rather, the Roosevelt Corollary was &quot;an entirely new diplomatic tenet that epitomized his &#x27;big stick&#x27; approach to foreign policy.&quot; Ricard continues that the Corollary shows the United States’ righteous and paternalistic views towards Central and Latin America, which it used to justify its foreign interference and enforcement of economic principles that the U.S. deemed to be secure and right for such states. 

In other words, while the Monroe Doctrine sought to bar entry to the European empires, the Roosevelt Corollary arguably indicated the United States&#x27; intention to take their place. It could also be pointed out how the corollary violates the principles of self-determination and sovereignty that are noted in the Declaration of Independence. Roosevelt was a figure who embodied many American values: he was a war hero, an individualist, and a man of the common people. Yet his decision to take action in Latin America contradicts with the ideas enshrined in international law, which became a target for criticism.

<doc id="278901" wikidata="Q4718350" url="?curid=278901" title="Alexander Berry">
<text>Alexander Berry (30 November 1781 – 17 September 1873) was a Scottish-born surgeon, merchant and explorer who was given in 1822 a land grant of 10,000 acres (40 km2) and 100 convicts to establish the first European settlement on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia.

This settlement became known as the Coolangatta Estate and developed into what is now the town of Berry, named in honour of Alexander and his brother David.

== Early life ==
Berry was born to parents James Berry and Isabel Tod at Hilltarvit Mains farmhouse, near Cupar in Fife, Scotland where his father was a tenant, during a blinding snowstorm on the evening of 30 November 1781 (St Andrew&#x27;s Day, the national day of Scotland). He was baptised on 6 December. He was one of nine siblings.

He was educated at Cupar grammar school, where he was a contemporary of the artist Sir David Wilkie. He studied medicine at St Andrews University from 1796 until 1798 and the University of Edinburgh from 1798 to 1801. His youthful intentions were to join the navy, but he was dissuaded from doing so by his father, and he became a surgeon&#x27;s mate for the East India Company instead.

Ship&#x27;s surgeons were permitted to take a substantial amount of cargo, so his responsibilities were both medical and mercantile. He travelled first to China and then to India, aboard the &quot;Lord Hawkesbury&quot;. The second voyage was profitable for Berry.

He decided to quit the medical profession, as he hated the whippings he was obliged to attend, and he was attracted to the commercial possibilities of shipping.

His third voyage was to the Cape of Good Hope in 1806. On arrival, he heard that New South Wales needed provisions. He purchased a ship, , with medical student Francis Shortt, to take provisions to the colony. While travelling as supercargo, he encountered storms which damaged his ship, so he stopped in Tasmania at Port Dalrymple, close to modern day Launceston. He sold half his provisions there and the remainder in Hobart. He then continued to Sydney, where he arrived on 13 January 1808 with only spirits remaining to sell.

There was no cargo available to take from Sydney back to the Cape, so Berry accepted a government job to evacuate settlers from Norfolk Island to Hobart. The timber he was promised in payment was unavailable, so he decided to go to Fiji to load a cargo of sandalwood. He also visited New Zealand, to drop off a Māori who was returning from a visit to England.

== The &quot;Boyd&quot; massacre ==
In 1809, while the vessel was loading cargo at the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, news came through of the massacre of the crew and passengers of the ship &quot;Boyd&quot; by local Māori. The &quot;City of Edinburgh&quot;, with Berry, set sail for Whangaroa, where he rescued four survivors and the ship&#x27;s papers by holding two chiefs hostage. He wrote in a letter to Governor Macquarie that he released the chiefs because &quot;there was no opportunity of sending the chiefs to Port Jackson&quot; (i.e. Sydney). He wrote in the &quot;Edinburgh Magazine&quot; that he had released them on condition that they lose their rank with their people, although he never expected that to happen.

== Shipwreck of the &quot;City of Edinburgh&quot; ==
Berry sailed eastwards from New Zealand with his cargo to the Cape of Good Hope, however a broken rudder forced him to make repairs in Valparaíso, and then travel to Lima. He found a buyer for his cargo, and secured another cargo from Guayaquil for Cadiz and began the journey in 1811. After calling in at Rio de Janeiro Berry was forced to abandon the &quot;City of Edinburgh&quot; during storms near the Azores. He made his way to Lisbon, Portugal. It was on the trip from Lisbon to Cádiz that he met Edward Wollstonecraft.

Wollstonecraft proceeded to London as Berry&#x27;s agent, and Berry remained for a time in Cádiz before also proceeding to London.

== Settlement in New South Wales ==
Berry set up a partnership with Wollstonecraft (Berry and Wollstonecraft) and sailed to Sydney in 1819. Berry sailed as supercargo aboard , leaving England January 1819, and arriving in Sydney in July.
He was shortly followed by Wollstonecraft aboard the &quot;Canada&quot;. They set up as merchants on George St, in The Rocks area. Berry began to plan a trip to England to expand their commercial connections there. He returned to England with &quot;Admiral Cockburn&quot; in February 1820.
Wollstonecraft obtained a land grant on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore in Berry&#x27;s absence.

Berry chartered the &quot;Royal George&quot; and returned to Sydney in November 1821 with an &quot;extensive assortment of merchandise&quot; for sale at their George St store, as well as the new Governor, Thomas Brisbane, as a passenger on board.

Berry began to seek out and negotiate for a larger land grant.

In January and February 1822 Berry went with Hamilton Hume and Lieutenant Robert Johnson on a journey of exploration down the coast of New South Wales aboard the &quot;Snapper&quot;. During the journey he investigated the land in Shoalhaven area.

In June 1822, Berry and Wollstonecraft purchased a small cutter, the &quot;Blanche&quot;, and Berry returned to the Shoalhaven with Hume and assigned servants (convicts) to develop his land grant there.

While attempting to cross the bar into the river in a small boat, two people drowned, including Davison, who was the boy that Berry had rescued from the &#x27;Boyd&#x27;.
Given the danger, Berry arranged to drag the &quot;Blanche&quot; across a sand bar that separated the Shoalhaven River from the Crookhaven River, with the Crookhaven entrance offering a safer passage. In order to provide safe boat access, Alexander Berry had Hamilton Hume oversee the digging of a canal through the bar using only hand tools, and in doing so, constructed the first land navigable canal in Australia. Hamilton Hume and a party of convict labourers cut a 209-yard canal linking the Shoalhaven River to the Crookhaven River in twelve days. A number of other hand dug canals are dotted around the Shoalhaven, supposedly also dug by convicts. These contrast by their banality with the striking convict stone walls which dot the landscape around Kiama, further north.

The partnership was granted there by Governor Brisbane on condition of providing for 100 convicts (1 per of the grand). Berry set up the Coolangatta Estate while Wollstonecraft stayed in Sydney to look after business there. Berry later secured two additional land grands of each. Together with purchases, the size of the estate grew to in the early 1840s.

Elizabeth Wollstonecraft, the sister of Edward Wollstonecraft, migrated to New South Wales and was married to Berry on 21 September 1827.

His partner, Edward Wollstonecraft, died in 1832, with the entire Coolangatta estate passing to Alexander Berry. Berry then shut the George St stores, and spent most of his time running the Coolangatta Estate. Three of his brothers (David, John and William) and two sisters (Janet and Agnes) migrated to Coolangatta in 1836, allowing Alexander to spend more time in Sydney. David and John managed the estate jointly, and David alone following John&#x27;s death in 1848.

Alexander&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, died in 1845 aged 63, at the Priory; a house owned by George Barney, on what was part of the Crow&#x27;s Nest estate, where they were living at the time. Alexander Berry thereupon donated the land for a cemetery to the Anglican Parish of St Leonards. It was to be St Thomas&#x27; Cemetery, Crows Nest, the first burial ground established on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore.

Crow&#x27;s Nest House was completed in 1850 and Alexander Berry lived there until his death.

Berry had a substantial library of more than 2,000 books by the time he died.

== Dispute with Francis Shortt ==
Francis Shortt was Berry&#x27;s partner in the &quot;City of Edinburgh&quot; at the Cape of Good Hope. He arrived in New South Wales in 1822 claiming that the partnership with Berry had not been dissolved, and that the partnership with Wollstonecraft was invalid. He claimed Berry had never made an account to him of the profits of the cargo of the &quot;City of Edinburgh&quot;. Shortt had been declared insolvent at the Cape of Good Hope before coming to Sydney. Shortt died in 1828 before the case was settled; his obituary stated that he had depended on friends for necessaries of life.

== Politics ==
Berry was an appointed member of the Legislative Council from 1829 to 1861. He was a conservative, opposing moves towards democracy, and local government.

On the issue of local government, Berry said &quot;the poor country people seem to be a set of asses only fit to be the negroes or slaves of the town … I cannot help laughing at the absurdity of the abolition of negro slavery when I perceive the Country people of New South Wales anxious to become the White Negroes of the Jews and publicans of Towns and Villages.&quot; Essentially Berry thought that only property-owning men should be allowed to govern themselves. In his view, country people were foolish for wanting local government, which would cause them to become oppressed servants of Jews and publicans (business owners), not unlike African-American slaves.

He refused to pay rates on his Shoalhaven Estate after the incorporation of a Shoalhaven Municipality, arguing that his property should not form part of the local government area. He was successful in the Supreme Court and in Privy Council appeal brought by the Municipality.

== Other interests ==
Berry was a member of the Philosophical Society in 1821 and a councillor on the Australian Philosophical Society. He was interested in Aborigines and geology, publishing a paper &quot;On the Geology of Part of the Coast of New South Wales&quot;.

== Reminiscences ==

Berry&#x27;s memoirs were published in 1912, entitled &#x27;Reminiscences&#x27;. They chiefly describe his experiences at sea, both with the East India company and his private travels, with only a short section covering his life in New South Wales. In particular he describes in detail his relationships with the indigenous people of New Zealand and Fiji, and his experiences during the rescue at the scene of the &quot;Boyd&quot; massacre.

== Legacy ==
Alexander Berry died on 17 September 1873 aged 91, at Crows Nest House. He was buried in family vault in St. Thomas&#x27; cemetery with his wife and Edward Wollstonecraft. The cemetery is now known as St Thomas Rest Park, and the graves are still present.

The probate value of the estate was £400,000 sterling which passed to his brother David, 14 years his junior. Charles Nicholson wrote in a letter to The Times in 1889 that Berry had prepared a will to bequeath the greater part of his estate to the University of St Andrews, but died a few hours before the time appointed to sign it.

David died unmarried in 1889 with the estate now worth £1,252,975 sterling and in his will fulfilled Alexander&#x27;s desire by making a bequest to the University of St. Andrews in Scotland of £100,000. In 1889 St Andrews used the £100,000 legacy to establish the &quot;Berry Chair of English Literature&quot;, which still continues today.

Alexander Berry and his brother David were possibly one of Australia&#x27;s earliest millionaire, and founder of the dairy industry in New South Wales.

The New South Wales South Coast town of Berry was named after the brothers after their death.

Berry Island, near the present day suburb of Wollstonecraft, and originally part of the Wollstonecraft estate was named after Alexander Berry. Berry Street in North Sydney and Alexander Street in Crows Nest are both named after him.

Berry&#x27;s Canal, the small canal that was constructed under direction of Alexander Berry at the Coolangatta Estate to link the Shoalhaven River and the Crookhaven River now forms the main Shoalhaven River estuary, with the former entrance to the Shoalhaven River at Shoalhaven Heads usually closed to the ocean, except during floods.

<doc id="278973" wikidata="Q747890" url="?curid=278973" title="Liberté (anthem)">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; &quot;Freedom&quot;) is the national anthem of Guinea. Adopted upon independence in 1958, it was arranged by Fodéba Keïta and is based on the melody of a Maninka praise song by Korofo Moussa for 19th-century Fouta Djallon king Alpha Yayo Diallo.

== History ==
=== Korofo Moussa&#x27;s song ===
The music of the anthem is derived from a praise song for the late-1800s king of Labé, in Fouta Djallon, Alpha Yaya Diallo (or Alfa Yaya). Alpha Yaya is, along with Wassoulou Empire founder Samory Touré, considered central by Guineans to the foundation of the modern Guinean nation, in part because of his fierce attempts to resist colonisation.

In 1904, Alpha Yaya was one of many traditional chiefs and kings summoned to a doctrinal conference with French colonists, who were still in the process of consolidating his territory. The chiefs each brought along a retinue for the journey; in Alpha Yaya&#x27;s retinue was griot Korofo Moussa, from Kissidougou in the south of the country. Alpha Yaya arrived to the conference on its sixth day, and Korofo Moussa is said to have spontaneously improvised, along with his troupe of dancers and kora players, a praise song for Alpha Yaya after he arrived. The song began with the line &quot;&quot; (&quot;Alpha Yaya, mansas (kings) are not the same&quot;). According to Fodéba Isto Keira, former Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture, the performance took place in the building of the modern Directorate of the Judicial Police in the Kaloum sub-prefecture of Conakry.

Korofo Moussa&#x27;s air quickly became popular; it was sung and played by all the griots for the rest of the conference, and within a few days it was known throughout Conakry. Alpha Yaya&#x27;s personal griot immediately trained to play the song. Upon the return of the kings and their retinues to their regions, it spread throughout the country.

=== Modern anthem ===
Upon approaching independence in 1958, the lyrics of Korofo Moussa&#x27;s song were reworked and written in French by artist, choreographer and politician Fodéba Keïta and Jean Cellier for the national anthem of Guinea. Korofo Moussa&#x27;s melody was retained for the anthem. According to Keira, Keïta used the solfège method when working with the music. Keira stated that the national anthem had to be inspired by something from Fouta Djallon for the sake of avoiding frustrations and preserving national unity. 

The anthem was adopted upon independence on 2 October 1958 and included in article 1 of the constitution of 10 November 1958. A translation of the anthem into Maninka was made by Djeli Mamoudou Kandé ( – 2008) from the Instrumental Ensemble. According to Kandé, while Minister of the Interior, Fodéba Keïta had in fact asked him to write the lyrics for the anthem some months after independence.

The anthem is played on national television at the close of every broadcasting day.

<text>&quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Guinea-Bissau. Written in 1963 by Amílcar Cabral (1924–1973) and composed by Xiao He (1918–2010), it was adopted upon independence from Portugal in 1974.

It was also the national anthem of Cape Verde, a legacy of both countries&#x27; joint independence, until 1996, when a new anthem (&quot;&quot;) was adopted by Cape Verde.

== History ==
The anthem was written by independence leader of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde Amílcar Cabral. Cabral, a Bissau-Guinean son of Bissau-Guineans and Cape Verdeans, was the leader of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC).

In 1963, a delegation from then Portuguese Guinea visited China and heard music by composer Xiao He. Cabral asked Xiao to compose a piece that would inspire his people in their struggle for independence. Set to a 1963 poem by Cabral, the piece was later adopted by Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde as the national anthem upon their independence from Portugal in 1974.

In the 1990s, after the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde allowed multi-party rule, it was decided that Cape Verde should adopt its own national symbols, including a flag and anthem. A new anthem, &quot;&quot;, was adopted in 1996.

<doc id="279051" wikidata="Q858680" url="?curid=279051" title="Dear Land of Guyana, of Rivers and Plains">
<text>&quot;Green Land of Guyana&quot;, also known by its opening line &quot;Dear Land of Guyana&quot;, is the national anthem of Guyana. Robert Cyril Gladstone Potter composed the music, while the lyrics were authored by Archibald Leonard Luker. Two separate contests were held to determine the words and the tune, respectively. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1966, when the country gained independence from the United Kingdom.

==History==
The British amalgamated the formerly Dutch colonies of Berbice, Demerara and Essequibo in 1814 into a single colony – British Guiana – and ruled over it until 1966. During the run up to independence in the early 1960s, several attempts were made by government committees to select the text to the new national anthem, but they all resulted in an impasse. Finally, in 1965, a fresh contest was held, and a new committee was formed, composed of individuals who possessed &quot;broad literary and poetic backgrounds&quot;. The criteria they formulated for the anthem was that it should be august, inspire a love of country and evoke its unique characteristics, while at the same time be uncomplicated enough so that it could be comprehended by children. It was also supposed to be politically neutral, secular and dissimilar to the national anthems of other countries.

The competition saw a total of 266 entries submitted. The committee first narrowed this down to 40, and from that they chose 12 finalists. The lyrics penned by Archibald Leonard Luker were ultimately selected. A second contest was subsequently held to determine the music that was to accompany these lyrics. Another committee, consisting of a hundred people, selected from a blind audition. The identities of the composers were not revealed to them, so they chose from numbers that corresponded to the respective songs. In the end, a tune composed by Cyril Potter was chosen.

==Lyrics==
The first stanza of &quot;Dear Land of Guyana, of Rivers and Plains&quot; alludes to the country&#x27;s geography. The other verses personify Guyana as a mother to its citizens, who have a duty of respect and protection of her.

<doc id="279073" wikidata="Q214459" url="?curid=279073" title="La Dessalinienne">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Haiti. This march was written by Justin Lhérisson and composed by Nicolas Geffrard.

==Etymology==
&quot;La Dessalinienne&quot; is named in honor of Haiti&#x27;s revolutionary leader and first ruler Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The title was suggested by historian Clément Lanier.

==History==
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Haitian Revolution, a competition was held for a national anthem in 1903. The poetic words of Justin Lhérisson and martial composition of Nicolas Geffrard won over the judges, who preferred it to &quot;L&#x27;Artibonitienne&quot; by Capois diplomat Louis Edouard Pouget.

The anthem was premiered at an October 1903 celebration of the Armée Indigène&#x27;s entry into Port-au-Prince organised by the Association du Petit Théâtre. It was sung by Auguste de Pradines, also known as Kandjo. The text and music were printed at Bernard&#x27;s in Port-au-Prince and distributed throughout the country during the week. It was officially adopted as the national anthem in 1904.

==Lyrics==
As a one-verse rendition can be relatively short, a common way to lengthen a performance is to perform an abridged arrangement consisting of the first verse immediately followed by the last.

===Official lyrics===
===Unofficial lyrics===
A Haitian Creole version was created by Raymond A. Moise, and Haitian singer Ansy Dérose (1934–1998) helped popularize it in 1980. Although it became widely accepted, it is not official.

<text>The &quot;National Anthem of Honduras&quot; () was adopted by presidential decree 42 in 1915. The lyrics were written by Augusto Constantino Coello and the music composed by Carlos Hartling.

Unofficially, the anthem is sometimes called &quot;&quot; (&quot;Your flag is a splendour of sky&quot;), which is in the first line of the chorus.

== History ==
Between independence from Spain in 1821 and 1915, Honduras did not have an official national anthem and used various unofficial anthems such as &quot; (by Rómulo E. Durón), &quot;, &quot; (of unknown authorship), &quot; (by Valentín Durón), &quot; Gerardo Barrios&quot; (by Belgian author Coussin, used during the presidency of José María Medina) and the &quot;&quot;.

In 1904, a group of intellectuals proposed to President Manuel Bonilla a competition to find a national anthem, but a competition was not held until 1910 with Decree No. 115, during the presidency of Miguel Rafael Dávila Cuéllar, at the initiative of deputies Rómulo E. Durón and Ramón Valladares. This competition was declared void in 1912, because the ten works presented did not meet the requirements.

Later, a competition was held in which those who competed included Valentín Durón, Santos B. Tercero, Jerónimo Reyna, Juan Ramón Molina and . The works were published in the . The competition was won by a poem titled &quot; or &quot;, by writer Augusto C. Coello. German-born composer Carlos Hartling was commissioned to compose the music for the anthem, which he did in 1903, although he had previously written scores for the anthem while lyrics were not available.

The anthem was made official on 13 November 1915 with Decree No. 42 by President , which was published in Gazette No. 4 529 of 15 January 1916 and approved by decree number 34 of 23 January 1917. It was first performed at the Guadalupe Reyes School in Tegucigalpa on 15 September 1915, and performances in official functions began in 1917, the first of which was a performance at the in Comayagüela. An official explanation of the anthem by Gualberto Cantarero Palacios was later published by the Ministry of Public Education.

==Lyrics==
In its entirety, the anthem is a brief chronology of Honduran history. The anthem consists of the chorus and seven verses. For official functions and school exercises, only the chorus and seventh verse are sung, which was ordered in the late 1920s by minister Presentacion Centeno during the presidency of Miguel Paz Barahona. During sport events where brevity is essential, a shorter, abridged version is performed which usually consists of only one repeat of the chorus and a section of the verse.

The chorus, which is sung before and after the seventh verse, is a description of Honduras&#x27;s chief national symbols, the flag and the coat of arms. The seventh verse is a patriotic call to duty to Hondurans to defend the flag and the nation. 

By the time Hondurans complete their sixth year of elementary education, they will have memorised and been taught the meaning of the chorus and all seven stanzas. For graduations in middle school, high school, university or another type of graduation, an exam will be done based on a questionnaire of the National Anthem.

<text>The Good Neighbor policy ( ) was the foreign policy of the administration of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt towards Latin America. Although the policy was implemented by the Roosevelt administration, President Woodrow Wilson had previously used the term, but subsequently went on to justify U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution and occupation of Haiti. Senator Henry Clay had coined the term &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; in the previous century. President Herbert Hoover turned against interventionism and developed policies that Roosevelt perfected.

The policy&#x27;s main principle was that of non-intervention and non-interference in the domestic affairs of Latin America. It also reinforced the idea that the United States would be a &quot;good neighbor&quot; and engage in reciprocal exchanges with Latin American countries. Overall, the Roosevelt administration expected that this new policy would create new economic opportunities in the form of reciprocal trade agreements and reassert the influence of the United States in Latin America; however, many Latin American governments were not convinced and after a few decades the United States began its current &quot;world police&quot; role.

==Background==
In the early 20th century, the United States periodically intervened militarily in Latin American nations to protect its interests, particularly the commercial interests of the US business community. After the Roosevelt Corollary of 1904, whenever the United States felt its debts were not being repaid in a prompt fashion, its citizens&#x27; business interests were being threatened, or its access to natural resources was being impeded, military intervention or threats were often used to coerce the respective government into compliance. This made many Latin Americans wary of U.S. presence in their region and subsequently hostilities grew towards the United States.

President Wilson landed U.S. troops in Mexico in 1914, in Haiti in 1915, in the Dominican Republic in 1916, in Mexico a second time in 1916, and in Mexico several additional times before Wilson left office, in Cuba in 1917, and in Panama in 1918. Also, for most of the Wilson administration, the U.S. military occupied Nicaragua, installed a Nicaraguan president that the U.S. preferred, and ensured that the country signed treaties favorable to the U.S.

==Hoover administration==
Although most of the credit for the policy is given to Roosevelt, it was President Herbert Hoover who initially came up with the idea. Following a policy of non-intervention, Hoover was one of the strongest voices against U.S. occupation as well as an enthusiastic promoter of inter-American relations.

==Roosevelt administration==

=== Background ===
While working under President Wilson, Roosevelt had perpetuated ideas of American racial superiority by believing that the people of Latin American were incapable of self-government. However, by 1928 he had switched his point of view, becoming an advocate for cooperation.

The Great Depression meant that trade with foreign countries had suffered a massive blow, so the U.S. government were actively trying to find a way to compensate for it.

===Policy===
In an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, Roosevelt announced on March 4, 1933, during his inaugural address, &quot;In the field of World policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others, the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a World of neighbors.&quot; In order to create a friendly relationship between the United States and Central as well as South American countries, Roosevelt sought to abstain from asserting military force in the region. This position was affirmed by Cordell Hull, Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of State at a conference of American states in Montevideo in December 1933. Hull said: &quot;No country has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.&quot; Roosevelt then confirmed the policy in December of the same year: &quot;The definite policy of the United States from now on is one opposed to armed intervention.&quot;

===Impact===

The Good Neighbor Policy terminated the U.S. Marines occupation of Haiti in 1934, led to the annulment of the Platt Amendment by the Treaty of Relations with Cuba in 1934, and allowed for the negotiation of compensation for Mexico&#x27;s nationalization of foreign-owned oil assets to take place in 1938.

The United States Maritime Commission contracted Moore-McCormack Lines to operate a &quot;Good Neighbor fleet&quot; of ten cargo ships and three recently laid-up ocean liners between the United States and South America. The passenger liners were the recently defunct Panama Pacific Line&#x27;s , &quot;Virginia&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. Moore-McCormack had them refurbished and renamed them SS &quot;Uruguay&quot;, and for their new route between New York and Buenos Aires &quot;via&quot; Rio de Janeiro, Santos, and Montevideo.

The policy sought to redefine the way Americans perceived Latin Americans, both politically as well as racially, while at the same time maintaining hemispheric unity. In order to accomplish this, Roosevelt created the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) in August 1940 and appointed Nelson Rockefeller to head the organization. The OCIAA was essentially a propaganda tool used by the United States to define Latin American society, as they perceived it. One division within the OCIAA, the Motion Picture Division, was headed by John Hay Whitney, with the main intent to abolish preexisting stereotypes of Latin Americans that were prevalent throughout American society. Whitney was convinced of:The power that Hollywood films could exert in the two-pronged campaign to win the hearts and minds of Latin Americans and to convince Americans of the benefits of Pan-American friendship.In order to accomplish this, Whitney urged film studios to hire Latin Americans and to produce movies that placed Latin America in a favorable light. Further, he urged filmmakers to refrain from producing movies that perpetuated negative stereotypes. Historically, Latin Americans were portrayed as lazy, backwards and suspicious. One film star who emerged then was Carmen Miranda. Used as a product to promote positive hemispheric relations, her films, including &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot;, explicitly promoted the Good Neighbor policy.
Similarly, in 1941 William S. Paley and Edmund A. Chester at CBS Radio collaborated with the OCIAA to create the &quot;La Cadena de las Américas&quot; (Network of the Americas) radio network to broadcast news and cultural programs which reflected Roosevelt&#x27;s Good neighbor Policy and Pan-Americanism throughout Latin America during World War II. As a professional journalist, Chester insisted upon the presentation of accurate news programming as well as cultural programs which dispelled the negative stereotype of Americans toiling as automatons in a national industrial machine. Also, the policy&#x27;s cultural impact included the launch of CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Viva América&quot; and &quot;Hello Americans&quot; programs and the Walt Disney films &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944).

By the end of World War II, Latin America was, according to one historian, the region of the world most supportive of American foreign policy.

=== Further impact ===
By 1936 global peace was broken, as nations in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa were at war. Against this background the United States called for a special meeting of the Pan-American Union. Held in Buenos Aires from December 3 to December 26, 1936, the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace received great attention from the countries of the western hemisphere. Franklin D. Roosevelt attended the meeting in person and delivered a speech in which he said that American countries are determined to live in peace and that if there is any aggression from outside, the countries of the western hemisphere are fully prepared to negotiate for their common security and interests.

The important results of the Buenos Aires Conference in 1936 led to further developments at the Pan-American Conference of Lima 1938, where the Conference of American States agreed in a declaration to settle all disputes peacefully, to refrain from interfering in other countries&#x27; internal affairs, to deny recognition of territories seized, and make it illegal to collect debts by force. The declaration was to be known as the &quot;Declaration of Lima&quot;.

=== 1939 World&#x27;s Fair ===

The 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair was just the place to promote neighborly relations between the United States and Latin America. Placed against the backdrop of a growing Nazi threat, the World&#x27;s Fair was an attempt to escape from the looming prospect of war and to promote peace and interdependence between nations. With the fair boasting over 60 countries, with some coming from Latin America, it was the place to redefine negative Latin American stereotypes. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, and the Pan American Union were all represented at the World&#x27;s Fair. Each country seized the opportunity to showcase their country and to make it more appealing to those around the world, especially in the United States. In their bid to increase cultural awareness at the World&#x27;s Fair, each country promoted tourism, and strived to compare itself to the United States in an effort to appeal to Americans.

===Legacy===
The era of the Good Neighbor Policy ended with the ramp-up of the Cold War in 1945, as the United States felt there was a greater need to protect the Western Hemisphere from Soviet influence. The changes conflicted with the Good Neighbor Policy&#x27;s fundamental principle of non-intervention and led to a new wave of US involvement in Latin American affairs. Until the end of the Cold War the United States directly or indirectly attacked all suspected socialist or communist movements in the hope of ending the spread of Soviet influence. U.S. interventions and interference in this era included the CIA overthrow of Guatemala&#x27;s President Jacobo Árbenz in 1954, the unsuccessful CIA-backed Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba in 1961, support for the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état which helped to remove from power democratically elected President João Goulart, the occupation of the Dominican Republic, in response to the Dominican Civil War, in 1965–1966, the CIA subversion of Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1970–1973, and support for the 1973 coup d&#x27;etat that removed Allende, and support for Operation Charly in Central America and Operation Condor in South America, and the CIA subversion of Nicaragua&#x27;s Sandinista government from about 1981 to 1990.

After World War II, the Organization of American States was established in 1949. However, the U.S. began to shift its focus to aid and rebuilding efforts in Europe and Japan. These U.S. efforts largely neglected the Latin American countries, though U.S. investors and businessmen did have some stake in the nations to the South. In the late 1950s, United States strengthened relations with Latin America, launching the Inter-American Development Bank and later the Alliance for Progress. However, in the late 1960s, as part of the Cold War, the United States government provided support to right-wing dictatorships with Operation Condor. Also, in the context of the War on Drugs, the United States government has collaborated with local governments to fight cartels, for example with the Plan Colombia and the Mérida Initiative.

===Good Neighbor Policy to Brazil===

Brazil had the most important branch of the Office of Inter-American Affairs on the entire continent. In all, 13 regional offices were created in different Brazilian capitals. Given Brazil&#x27;s strategic importance for World War II, the country was the target of an immense U.S. propaganda effort, mainly through films, cartoons, and documentaries. According to one historian, from 1942 to 1945, relations between Brazil and the United States were intense. Many American artistic and intellectual personalities were in Brazil working on behalf of the Good Neighbor Policy, including Walt Disney, Orson Welles, Samuel G. Engel, Gregg Toland, and John Ford. During the war, U.S. propaganda films were seen by over 70 million Brazilian viewers.

In October 1940, the CIAA reached out to Disney Studios in effort to increase meaningful relationships between the United States and Latin America. As German and fascist influence began to expand around the world, the United States wanted to keep nations such as Argentina and Brazil close. Starting in August 1941 Walt Disney and his team would take a three-month tour through Latin America to mainly receive a better understanding of the area for their respective films. Starting in Brazil, the Disney Studios team would explore the country while working with the Brazilian people in order to prepare for future films. There were eventually two films that were produced in result of the Walt Disney Project; those two films being &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; and &quot;The Three Caballeros.&quot; These two films included the likes of the famous Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck characters, who had become worldwide known figures. The two films, which were released in Latin America, worked to build better relations by including famous Disney characters into the world of Latin America. Walt Disney&#x27;s portray of the Good Neighbor Policy seemed to be a success, as these films seemed to be very useful.

===Good Neighbor Policy to Cuba===

The Good Neighbor Policy caused the annulment of the Platt Amendment in 1934, though the U.S. did continue to exert influence on Cuban affairs. In one notable example, the U.S. government expressed to the Cuban government that it should increase American quotas for Cuban sugar under a trade agreement, with the idea that it would benefit Cuba&#x27;s local economy.

=== Significance ===
Good Neighbor diplomacy during Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency had alleviated some of the tensions that were caused by the United States being a previously bad neighbor. The earlier policies regarding U.S. military intervention and supervision under the Monroe Doctrine were unpopular with Latin Americans, since it was perceived as an invasive foreign policy measure. For example, U.S. President William Howard Taft used dollar diplomacy and dispatched 2,700 Marines to Nicaragua in order to suppress a revolution against the government of President Adolfo Díaz, which was directly threatening U.S. economic interests in Central America. After the United States successfully suppressed the revolution, Taft left Marines in Nicaragua to hinder and deter any other potential uprisings against the Díaz government. Roosevelt opposed U.S. intervention in Nicaragua, since he understood that Latin Americans opposed U.S. intervention and he viewed the Monroe Doctrine as a cooperative effort rather than an aggressive U.S. foreign policy measure. Being a Good Neighbor became synonymous with non-intervention, even though non-intervention had its exceptions. The United States did adhere to non-intervention when U.S. interests were not directly threatened, but the United States did continue to intervene when it was deemed necessary, such as having U.S. military personnel stationed within the Panama Canal Zone. Nevertheless, Good Neighbor diplomacy was an important collective effort between the United States and Latin America, which fostered a spirit of cooperation and produced a sense of hemispheric solidarity amongst each other as seen with the Declaration of Lima.

<text>John Vliet Lindsay (; November 24, 1921 – December 19, 2000) was an American politician and lawyer. During his political career, Lindsay was a U.S. congressman, the mayor of New York City, and a candidate for U.S. president. He was also a regular guest host of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Lindsay served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from January 1959 to December 1965 and as mayor of New York from January 1966 to December 1973.

He switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party in 1971, and launched a brief and unsuccessful bid for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination, and later for the Democratic Nomination for U.S. Senate in 1980.

==Early life==
Lindsay was born in New York City on West End Avenue to George Nelson Lindsay and the former Florence Eleanor Vliet. He grew up in an upper-middle-class family of English and Dutch descent. Lindsay&#x27;s paternal grandfather migrated to the United States in the 1880s from the Isle of Wight, and his mother was from an upper-middle-class family that had been in New York since the 1660s. His mother was a descendant of Dirck Jans van der Vliet (1612–1689) who settled in the then Dutch settlement of New Netherlands around 1659–1660 as son Henderick was born in what is now Livingston, New York. Lindsay&#x27;s father was a successful lawyer and investment banker. Lindsay attended the Buckley School, St. Paul&#x27;s School, and Yale, where he was admitted to the class of 1944 and joined Scroll and Key.

== Military service and legal career ==
With the outbreak of World War II, Lindsay completed his studies early and in 1943 joined the United States Navy as a gunnery officer. He obtained the rank of lieutenant, earning five battle stars through action in the invasion of Sicily and a series of landings in the Pacific theater. After the war, he spent a few months as a ski bum and a couple of months training as a bank clerk before returning to New Haven, where he received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1948, ahead of schedule. In 1949, he began his legal career at the law firm of Webster, Sheffield, Fleischmann, Hitchcock &amp; Chrystie.

== Marriage ==

Back in New York City, Lindsay met his future wife, Mary Anne Harrison (1926–2004), at the wedding of Nancy Walker Bush (daughter of Connecticut&#x27;s Senator Prescott Bush and sister of future President George Herbert Walker Bush and aunt of George W. Bush &amp; Jeb Bush), where he was an usher and Harrison a bridesmaid. She was a graduate of Vassar College and a distant relative of William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison. They married in 1949. That same year Lindsay was admitted to the bar, and rose to become a partner in his law firm four years later. They had three daughters and a son.

==U.S. Representative==
Lindsay began gravitating toward politics as one of the founders of the Youth for Eisenhower club in 1951 and as president of the New York Young Republican Club in 1952. He went on to join the United States Department of Justice in 1955 as executive assistant to Attorney General Herbert Brownell. There he worked on civil liberties cases as well as the 1957 Civil Rights Act. In 1958, with the backing of Brownell as well as Bruce Barton, John Aspinwall Roosevelt, and Edith Willkie, Lindsay won the Republican primary and went on to be elected to Congress as the representative of the &quot;Silk Stocking&quot; 17th district, exemplified by Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side but also encompassing the diverse Lower East Side and historically bohemian Greenwich Village.

While in Congress, Lindsay established a liberal voting record increasingly at odds with his own party. He was an early supporter of federal aid to education and Medicare; and advocated the establishment of a federal United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and a National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities. He was called a maverick, casting the lone dissenting vote for a Republican-sponsored bill extending the power of the Postmaster General to impound obscene mail and one of only two dissenting votes for a bill allowing federal interception of mail from Communist countries. Also known for his wit, when asked by his party leaders why he opposed legislation to combat Communism and pornography, he replied that the two were the major industries of his district and if they were suppressed then &quot;the 17th district would be a depressed area&quot;. Lindsay voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and 1964, the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

==Mayor of New York City==
In 1965, Lindsay was elected Mayor of New York City as a Republican with the support of the Liberal Party of New York in a three-way race. He defeated Democratic mayoral candidate Abraham D. Beame, then City Comptroller, as well as conservative thinker and &quot;National Review&quot; founder William F. Buckley Jr., who ran on the Conservative Party line. The unofficial motto of the campaign, taken from a Murray Kempton column, was &quot;He is fresh and everyone else is tired&quot;.

===Labor issues===
On his first day as mayor, January 1, 1966, the Transport Workers Union of America, led by Mike Quill, shut down the city with a complete halt of subway and bus service. As New Yorkers endured the transit strike, Lindsay remarked, &quot;I still think it&#x27;s a fun city&quot;, and walked four miles (6 km) from his hotel room to City Hall in a gesture to show it. Dick Schaap, then a columnist for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, popularized the term in an article titled &quot;Fun City&quot;. In the article, Schaap sardonically pointed out that it was not.

In 1966, the settlement terms of the transit strike, combined with increased welfare costs and general economic decline, forced Lindsay to lobby the New York State legislature for a new municipal income tax and higher water rates for city residents, plus a new commuter tax for people who worked in the city but resided elsewhere. The transit strike was the first of many labor struggles. In 1968, in an attempt to decentralize the city&#x27;s school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city complete control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities to have more of a say in their schools. The city&#x27;s teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, however, saw the breakup as a way of union busting, as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result, in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, one of the neighborhoods where the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community-run school board. The UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, citing that the teachers had been fired without due process. When their demands were ignored, the UFT called the first of three strikes, leading ultimately to a protracted citywide teachers&#x27; strike that stretched over a seven-month period between May and November. The strike was tinged with racial and anti-Semitic overtones, pitting Black and Puerto Rican parents against Jewish teachers and supervisors. Many thought the mayor had made a bad situation worse by taking sides against the teachers. The episode left a legacy of tensions between African-Americans and Jews that went on for years, and Lindsay called it his greatest regret.
That same year, 1968, also saw a three-day Broadway strike and a nine-day sanitation strike. Quality of life in the city reached a nadir during the sanitation strike as mounds of garbage caught fire and strong winds blew the filth through the streets. In June 1968, the New York City Police Department deployed snipers to protect Lindsay during a public ceremony, shortly after they detained a knife-wielding man who had demanded to meet the mayor. With the schools shut down, police engaged in a slowdown, firefighters threatening job actions, the city awash in garbage, and racial and religious tensions breaking to the surface, Lindsay later called the last six months of 1968 &quot;the worst of my public life.&quot;

The summer of 1971 ushered in another devastating strike as over 8,000 workers belonging to AFSCME District Council 37 walked off their jobs for two days. The strikers included the operators of the city&#x27;s drawbridges and sewage treatment plants. Drawbridges over the Harlem River were locked in the &quot;up&quot; position, barring automobile travel into Manhattan, and hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw sewage flowed into local waterways.

===Racial and civil unrest===

Lindsay served on the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, and was its vice chairman. This body was appointed in 1967 by President Johnson after riots in urban centers of the US, including Newark and Detroit. Lindsay maximized publicity and coverage of his activities on the commission, and while other commissioners made inconspicuous visits to riot-damaged sites, Lindsay would alert the press before his fact-finding missions. Nonetheless, he was especially influential in producing the Kerner Report; its dramatic language of the nation &quot;moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal&quot; was consistent with his rhetoric.

President Johnson ignored the report and rejected the Kerner Commission&#x27;s recommendations. In April 1968, one month after the release of the Kerner report, rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. However, in New York City, Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling Black residents that he regretted King&#x27;s death and was working against poverty. He is credited with averting riots in the city with this direct response, even as other major cities burned. David Garth, who accompanied Lindsay that night, recalled: &quot;There was a wall of people coming across 125th Street, going from west to east ... I thought we were dead. John raised his hands, said he was sorry. It was very quiet. My feeling was, his appearance there was very reassuring to people because it wasn&#x27;t the first time they had seen him. He had gone there on a regular basis. That gave him credibility when it hit the fan.&quot;

Lindsay showed his support for New York&#x27;s African American community through his administration&#x27;s sponsorship of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which is documented in the 2021 music film, &quot;Summer of Soul&quot;. The host of the festival, Tony Lawrence, introduces the mayor to the Harlem crowd as &quot;our blue-eyed soul brother.&quot;

===Blizzard of 1969===

On February 10, 1969, New York City was pummeled with of snow. On the first day alone, 14 people died and 68 were injured. Within a day, the mayor was criticized for giving favored treatment to Manhattan at the expense of the other boroughs. Charges were made that a city worker solicited a bribe to clean streets in Queens.

Over a week later, streets in eastern Queens still remained unplowed by the city, enraging the borough&#x27;s residents, many who felt that the city&#x27;s other boroughs always took a back seat to Manhattan. Lindsay traveled to Queens, but his visit was not well received. His car could not make its way through Rego Park, and even in a four-wheel-drive truck, he had trouble getting around. In Kew Gardens Hills, the mayor was booed; one woman screamed, &quot;You should be ashamed of yourself.&quot; In Fresh Meadows, a woman told the mayor: &quot;Get away, you bum.&quot; Later during his walk through Fresh Meadows, another woman called him &quot;a wonderful man,&quot; prompting the mayor to respond: &quot;And you&#x27;re a wonderful woman, not like those fat Jewish broads up there,&quot; pointing to women in a nearby building who had criticized him.

The blizzard, dubbed the &quot;Lindsay Snowstorm,” prompted a political crisis that became &quot;legendary in the annals of municipal politics&quot; as the scenes conveyed a message that the mayor of New York City was indifferent to the middle class and poor citizens of the city.

===Reelection===
In 1969, a backlash against Lindsay caused him to lose the Republican mayoral primary to state Senator John Marchi, who was enthusiastically supported by William F. Buckley and the rest of the party&#x27;s conservative wing. In the Democratic primary, the most conservative candidate, City Comptroller Mario Procaccino, defeated several more liberal contenders and won the nomination with only a plurality of the votes. &quot;The more the Mario,&quot; he quipped. Procaccino, who ran to Lindsay&#x27;s right, went on to coin the term &quot;limousine liberal&quot; to describe Lindsay and his wealthy Manhattan backers.

Despite losing the Republican nomination, Lindsay remained on the ballot as the candidate of the New York Liberal Party. In his campaign he said &quot;mistakes were made&quot; and called being mayor of New York City &quot;the second toughest job in America.&quot; Two television advertisements described his position: In one he looked directly into the camera and said, &quot;I guessed wrong on the weather before the city&#x27;s biggest snowfall last winter. And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all made some mistakes. But I brought 225,000 more jobs to this town. And that was no mistake... And we did not have a Detroit, a Watts or Newark. And those were no mistakes. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America. But the things that go right are those things that make me want it.&quot; The second opened with a drive through the Holland Tunnel from lower Manhattan toward New Jersey and suggested that, &quot;Every New Yorker should take this trip at least once before election day...&quot; followed by video of Newark, New Jersey which had been devastated by race riots.

While narrowly losing Brooklyn and the Bronx due to Procaccino&#x27;s entrenched support among ethnic, working class whites (with Marchi winning his native Staten Island), Lindsay was able to vanquish his opponents with support from three distinct groups. First were the city&#x27;s minorities, mostly African Americans and Puerto Ricans, who were concentrated in Harlem, the South Bronx and various Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville. Second were the white and economically secure residents of certain areas of Manhattan. Third were the whites in the boroughs outside Manhattan who had a similar educational background and &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; attitude, namely residents of solidly middle-class neighborhoods, including Forest Hills and Kew Gardens in Queens and Brooklyn Heights in Brooklyn. This third category included many traditionally Democratic Jewish Americans who were repelled by Procaccino&#x27;s conservatism. This created a plurality coalition (42%) in Lindsay&#x27;s second three-way race. His margin of victory rose from just over 100,000 more votes than his Democratic opponent in 1965 to over 180,000 votes over Procaccino in 1969, despite appearing on just one third party ballot line (see New York City Mayoral Elections).

===Hard-hat riots===

On May 8, 1970, near the intersection of Wall Street and Broad Street and at New York City Hall, a riot started when about 200 construction workers mobilized by the New York State AFL–CIO labor federation attacked about 1,000 high school and college students and others protesting the Kent State shootings, the Cambodian Campaign, and the Vietnam War. Some attorneys, bankers, and investment analysts from nearby Wall Street investment firms tried to protect many of the students but were themselves attacked, and some onlookers reported that the police stood by and did nothing. Although more than 70 people were injured, including four policemen, only six people were arrested. The following day, Lindsay severely criticized the police for their lack of action. Police Department labor leaders later accused Lindsay of &quot;undermining the confidence of the public in its Police Department&quot; by his statements and blamed the inaction on inadequate preparations and &quot;inconsistent directives&quot; in the past from the mayor&#x27;s office. Several thousand construction workers, longshoremen and white-collar workers protested against the mayor on May 11 and again on May 16. Protesters called Lindsay &quot;the red mayor,&quot; &quot;traitor,&quot; &quot;Commie rat,&quot; and &quot;bum.&quot; The mayor described the mood of the city as &quot;taut.&quot;

===Police corruption===
In 1970, &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed New York City Police Department Patrolman Frank Serpico&#x27;s claims of widespread police corruption. As a result, the Knapp Commission was eventually formed that April by Lindsay, with investigations beginning in June, although public hearings did not start until October 18, 1971. Its preliminary report was not issued until August 1972, and final recommendations only released on December 27, 1972. Because of his forming of the Knapp Commission, many NYPD officers disliked him and didn&#x27;t want him to attend their funerals in case they died on duty and heckled, hissed, jeered and booed him when he did appear. The wife of Rocco Laurie, one of two city police officers who were murdered by Black revolutionaries in 1972, specifically stated that she did not want Lindsay to attend her husband&#x27;s funeral that year.

===Assessments===
A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Lindsay as the sixteenth-worst American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

==Party switch and presidential campaign==

Lindsay was mentioned as a Republican Vice Presidential possibility in 1968, but was found to be unacceptable by Southern conservatives, and Spiro Agnew was nominated instead. Lindsay’s original break with the Republican Party began immediately after he failed to win the 1969 Republican mayoral primary, and his subsequent association with the New York Liberal Party for that election. In 1971, Lindsay and his wife cut ties with the Republican Party by registering with the Democratic Party. Lindsay said, &quot;In a sense, this step recognizes the failure of 20 years in progressive Republican politics. In another sense, it represents the renewed decision to fight for new national leadership.&quot; Lindsay then launched a brief and unsuccessful bid for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination. He attracted positive media attention and was a successful fundraiser. Lindsay did well in the early Arizona caucus, coming in second place behind Edmund Muskie of Maine and ahead of eventual nominee George McGovern of South Dakota. Then in the March 14 Florida primary, he placed a weak fifth place, behind George Wallace of Alabama, Muskie, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, and Scoop Jackson of Washington (though he did edge out McGovern). Among his difficulties was New York City&#x27;s worsening problems, which Lindsay was accused of neglecting; a band of protesters from Forest Hills, Queens, who were opposed to his support for a low income housing project in their neighborhood, followed Lindsay around his aborted campaign itinerary to jeer and heckle him. His poor showing in Florida effectively doomed his candidacy. Shortly thereafter, influential Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman Meade Esposito called for Lindsay to end his campaign: &quot;I think the handwriting is on the wall; Little Sheba better come home.&quot; After a poor showing in the April 5 Wisconsin primary, Lindsay formally abandoned the race.

==Assessment==

In a 1972 Gallup poll, 60% of New Yorkers felt Lindsay&#x27;s administration was working poorly, nine percent rated it good, and not one person thought its performance excellent. By 1978, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Lindsay &quot;an exile in his own city&quot;.

Lindsay&#x27;s record remained controversial after he left politics. Conservative historian Fred Siegel, calling Lindsay the worst New York City mayor of the 20th century, said &quot;Lindsay wasn&#x27;t incompetent or foolish or corrupt, but he was actively destructive&quot;. Journalist Steven Weisman observed &quot;Lindsay&#x27;s congressional career had taught him little of the need for subtle bureaucratic maneuvering, for understanding an opponent&#x27;s self-interest, or for the great patience required in a sprawling government.&quot;

Lindsay&#x27;s budget aide Peter C. Goldmark, Jr. told historian Vincent Cannato that the administration &quot;failed to come to grips with what a neighborhood is. We never realized that crime is something that happens to, and in, a community.&quot; Assistant Nancy Seifer said &quot;There was a whole world out there that nobody in City Hall knew anything about ... If you didn&#x27;t live on Central Park West, you were some kind of lesser being.&quot; Many experts traced the city&#x27;s mid-1970s fiscal crisis to the Lindsay years, and to the new taxes that he imposed.

An alternate assessment was made by journalist Robert McFadden who said that &quot;By 1973, his last year in office, Mr. Lindsay had become a more seasoned, pragmatic mayor.&quot; McFadden also credited him for reducing racial tensions, leading to the prevention of riots that plagued Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark and other cities.

==Legacy==
Mario Cuomo, Carl McCall, and Carter F. Bales were among the many people who started their careers in public service in the Lindsay administration. Rev. Al Sharpton has said that he still remembers Lindsay having walked the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem when these neighborhoods were doing poorly economically.

Lindsay also fought to transform the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board from an internal police-run department, into a public-minded agency with a citizen majority board.

==Later life==

After leaving office, Lindsay returned to the law, but remained in the public eye as a commentator and regular guest host for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. In 1975, Lindsay made a surprise appearance on &quot;The Tony Awards&quot; telecast in which he, along with a troupe of celebrity male suitors in tuxedos, sang &quot;Mame&quot; to Angela Lansbury. He presented the award for Best Director Of A Play to John Dexter for the play &quot;Equus&quot;. Lindsay also tried his hand at acting, appearing in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Rosebud&quot;; the following year his novel, &quot;The Edge&quot;, was published (Lindsay had earlier authored two non-fiction memoirs): &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its contemporary review of the novel, said it was &quot;as dead-serious as a $100-a-plate dinner of gray meat and frozen candidates&#x27; smiles.&quot;

Attempting a political comeback in 1980, Lindsay made a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator from New York, and finished third. He was also active in New York City charities, serving on the board of the Association for a Better New York, and as chairman of the Lincoln Center Theater. On his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited Lindsay with a significant role in the rejuvenation of the theatre.

Medical bills from his Parkinson&#x27;s disease, heart attacks, and stroke depleted Lindsay&#x27;s finances, as did the collapse of two law firms where he worked, and he found himself without health insurance. Lindsay&#x27;s eight years of service as mayor left him seven years short of qualifying for a city pension. In 1996, with support from City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed Lindsay to two largely ceremonial posts to make him eligible for municipal health insurance coverage. He and his wife, Mary, moved to a retirement community in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, in November 1999, where he died on December 19, 2000, at the age of 79 of complications from pneumonia and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In 2000, Yale Law School created a fellowship program named in Lindsay&#x27;s honor. In 1998, a park in Brooklyn, Lindsay Triangle, was named in his honor, and in 2001, the East River Park was renamed in his memory. In December 2013, South Loop Drive in Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park was renamed after Lindsay, to commemorate his support for a car-free Central Park.

He was featured on a poster picture with Governor Nelson Rockefeller at the groundbreaking of the former World Trade Center in the city history section of the Museum of the City of New York at Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street.

<text>At least five record labels with the name Bullet Records have existed.

==Bullet Records, Nashville, 1946-1952==

The earliest Bullet Records was a record label based in Nashville, United States, which was started in 1946 by Jim Bulleit and C.V. Hitchcock. Bulleit was an early partner in Sun Records. Its only national hits were by orchestra leader Francis Craig. The pop hit &quot;Near You&quot; made in early 1947 was a monster, topping the charts for seventeen weeks and having a chart run of twenty-five weeks. Craig also made the charts at #3 with &quot;Beg Your Pardon&quot;, but no further hits were forthcoming. Despite these hits, the label was known for country music artists such as Boots Woodall&#x27;s Radio Wranglers, who also recorded for Capitol Records, and Southern Gospel artists such as the Rangers Quartet and Speer Family. The label also recorded blues singer and pianist Cecil Gant. In 1949 they released B. B. King&#x27;s first commercial single, &quot;Miss Martha King&quot;. Too much money was spent in hope of repeating the success of Francis Craig&#x27;s &quot;Near You&quot; and the label was in trouble by 1949. Jim Bulleit sold out to his share to Hitchcock in February of that year. The label limped on for a few years but was out of business by 1952.

The Bullet, Sur-Speed and Delta catalogs were purchased by Bluesland Productions in the mid-1990s.

==Other Bullet record labels==

Another label with the same name released &quot;In A Moment&quot; by the Intrigues, a Philadelphia R&amp;B quartet, in 1969. The song was re-released by Yew Records and became a top-40 hit.

Another Bullet label was a short-lived subsidiary of American Bang Records. Only one album by Peabo Bryson in 1976 was ever released. Bryson&#x27;s next label Capitol Records now owns the rights to the album &quot;Peabo&quot; and Bryson&#x27;s unreleased Bullet material.

The fourth known label with this name was based in England in the early 1980s and released NWOBHM artists. Among known releases is the self-titled 1983 debut EP from Danish Pretty Maids. Bullet Records UK was an offshoot of Bullet Mail Order. Because of its close ties with the British heavy metal scene at that time, it seemed a logical progression to form a label to promote little-known unsigned bands. Amongst the bands on the label were Wrathchild, Pretty Maids, Black Rose [from N.E.England], Le Griffe, Crisis (from Salt Lake City, US), Silverwing, Chrome Molly and Taipan [from Australia]. Whilst many of the releases were critically acclaimed, the company suffered from a lack of experience and through various reasons, cash-flow being one, was forced to cease trading in 1984. Bullet Records is currently a Registered Trademark owned by Clark Enslin.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kaiji Kawaguchi. It was published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Morning&quot; manga magazine from 1988 to 1996 and collected in 32 volumes.

The series was adapted into an anime television special and original video animation (OVA) series by Sunrise. The special was released in North America by Central Park Media.

In 1990, &quot;The Silent Service&quot; won the 14th Kodansha Manga Award for the general manga category. It has over 25 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series.

A live-action film adaptation premiered in Japanese theaters in September 2023.

==Plot==
Following the Cold War, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force jointly and secretly developed a nuclear submarine, the &quot;Seabat&quot;, with the United States Navy. Chosen as co-captain is Shiro Kaieda (the other co-captain is an American), while the &quot;Seabat&quot;″s crew is composed entirely of Kaieda&#x27;s crew from his previous command. On the &quot;Seabat&quot;″s maiden voyage, Kaieda abruptly takes control of the submarine, re-names it the &quot;Yamato&quot; and declares it to be an independent state. Kaieda and his crew intend sailing to Tokyo to form a formal alliance with Japan, and the United States Navy musters its entire Pacific fleet (including its most modern warships) to stop him. The United States is determined to recover the &quot;Yamato&quot; by any means, even if it risks another war with Japan, while the Japanese government is divided as to how the events surrounding the &quot;Yamato&quot; will determine Japan&#x27;s fate, and both governments remain unsure as to whether or not the &quot;Yamato&quot; is actually armed with nuclear missiles.

In the second OVA episode, &quot;Voyage 2&quot;, the &quot;Yamato&quot; enters Tokyo Bay and a special meeting is arranged between Kaieda and the Japanese government. At this meeting, which is attended by the world press and televised live, a formal Treaty of Mutual Assistance is eventually concluded between Japan and the &quot;Yamato&quot;. Additionally, Japanese Prime Minister Takegami proposes, and Kaieda agrees, to place both the Japanese forces and the &quot;Yamato&quot; under the aegis of the United Nations, and that the &quot;Yamato&quot; should present itself at a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council. However, while the &quot;Yamato&quot; is being reprovisioned inside the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, a secret refitting ship disguised as a tanker, President Bennett orders the American fleet to blockade the bay and launch an attack on the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; before the &quot;Yamato&quot; can depart, and refuses to halt the attack when Takegami protests. Fukamachi, who has been unsure of Kaieda&#x27;s plans/motives and whose sub &quot;Tatsunami&quot; is part of the Japanese escort fleet (which under orders can act defensively and not attack), must now protect Kaieda and the &quot;Yamato&quot;.

==Characters==

During the &quot;Seabat&quot;″s test voyage with the U.S. Navy, he orders his crews to fire a sonar torpedo against the U.S. Navy submarines, disabling their sonar systems, and escapes from the area. Later, Kaieda declares that his submarine is an independent state and re-names it &quot;Yamato&quot;. His crew trust him implicitly, and he trusts them equally.
:
:CO of the Japanese Diesel submarine &quot;Tatsunami&quot;; friend and rival of Kaieda. Kaieda and Fukamachi graduated from the National Defense Academy of Japan in the same year, and both were candidates for command of the new nuclear submarine &quot;Seabat&quot;. Considered reckless and far more emotional while Kaieda is considered careful and methodical, he tries to figure out what Kaieda is up to and what his ultimate goal is.

==Story==
===Background===
During the Heian Era (794–1185), Abe no Seimei was a close childhood friend of a noble named Masayuki, and his wife, Mune. While he was away from the palace, Masayuki often asked Seimei to stay by his wife&#x27;s side, guarding her and keeping her company. However, during the time that they spent together, Mune and Seimei fell in love and became increasingly romantically involved. Unbeknownst to them, Masayuki soon learned of the affair, and became overcome with grief and jealousy. One day while Seimei was on a trip to Kyoto, Masayuki snapped, murdered Mune and committed suicide. Guided by a premonition, Seimei rushed back to his hometown only to find out that he was too late. Overcome with guilt, he decided to perform a forbidden &quot;onmyō&quot;, ritual to resurrect the dead, by transferring himself and the bodies of Masayuki and Mune into a completely different world in which they were still alive. In doing so, Seimei soon found himself as &quot;Mr. Abe&quot; in mid-20th-century Osaka, where Mune Imamiya and Masayuki Asahina were pre-existing residents of this alternate world. Now, Masayuki was an ambitious, but largely unsuccessful young man who had enlisted Mr. Abe&#x27;s assistance to build the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade. He was also madly in love with Mune, a local girl whom he tried to woo (with little success) at every possible occasion. It was not long, however, before Mune fell in love with Abe, constantly pursuing him and offering him bento. Abe tried for a time to resist her advances, but eventually he was unable to contain his feelings, and had sex with Mune in his apartment. Unbeknownst to them, an instantly-jealous Masayuki accidentally discovered the truth. The next night he became staggeringly drunk and invited Abe to meet him at the Abeno Shrine, planning to murder him with a hidden butcher knife when he arrived. At first unsuspecting, Abe arrived on the scene, but once he saw the decrepitly drunk Masa he knew what was afoot. He promptly bid Masayuki farewell, then disappeared, going back to his job in the Heian Era, leaving a pregnant Mune behind him; her child is Sasshi&#x27;s father.

===Plot===
Childhood friends Arumi and Sasshi are residents of the Abenobashi commercial district in Abeno-ku, Osaka. After an accident, they find themselves transported to an alternate sword and sorcery world. Their attempt to get back to reality finds them traversing a series of nonsensical worlds built on science fiction, war, fantasy, dating sim games and American movies. Each alternate Abenobashi is a surreal manifestation of Sasshi&#x27;s interests, populated by analogs of the protagonist&#x27;s relatives and acquaintances and a blue-haired stranger known as Eutus.

Their quest to return home is at its core a because the Abenobashi dimensions are mostly hobby worlds of increasing sophistication. Sasshi does not want to go home, and in fact is the sole force that is propelling them between worlds. While chasing a cat in the first episode, Arumi&#x27;s grandfather fell off a roof and was hospitalized. With this new trauma pressuring him in addition to his apprehension about the eventual destruction of the shopping arcade and the Asahina&#x27;s moving away, Sasshi was no longer willing or able to cope with reality, and unbeknownst to even himself, he had caused their dimension to rewrite itself into worlds echoing his escapist obsessions.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
:
:Sayaka&#x27;s younger brother, he is a precocious, hyperactive, 12-year-old typical Osakan boy. He has a huge passion for collecting, role-playing games, sci-fi, dinosaurs, guns and visual novels. Sasshi&#x27;s family used to run the local bathhouse, the Turtle Bath, but was forced to give it up and move out due to redevelopment plans for the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade area. Sasshi spends his lazy days hanging out with his best friend Arumi. While visiting each world, Sasshi is quick to learn the gimmick behind each one, and eventually begins playing by the world&#x27;s &quot;rules&quot;. It is strongly hinted he has feelings for Arumi, and is preventing them from going back due to the fact she will leave for Hokkaido.
:
:Sasshi&#x27;s best friend and classmate, she is also 12 years old, having practically grown up together with him in the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade. A sensible and pragmatic girl who is a foil to Sasshi. Arumi&#x27;s eccentric father and stubborn grandfather run a French restaurant in the Shopping Arcade known as the Grill Pelican. It appears, however, that the Asahina family will be closing up shop in the near future as part of redevelopment in the area and moving to Hokkaido, forcing Arumi to leave Sasshi behind. She expresses a strong distaste for every world that she and Sasshi visit.

===Other characters===
:
:A recurring element of the Abenobashi dimensions who shares a bond with Sasshi, claiming to be doomed to wander dimensions until the cause of this misfortune is rectified. His real identity is the legendary Abe no Seimei, ultimately the one who created the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade in the guise of Mr. Abe. This in turn enables the existence of Sasshi and Arumi, with Abe being the former&#x27;s (illegitimate) paternal grandfather.
:
:Arumi&#x27;s stubborn and willful grandfather and the founder of the Grill Pelican restaurant, Masayuki has been around since the creation of the shopping arcade and befriended its head of construction Abe. It reality, Masayuki was originally a friend of Abe in the past, committing the murder of his wife Mune out of jealously towards Abe and taking his own life. Though Abe managed to revive the two in the modern era, history nearly repeated itself and Abe is forced to leave the two to look after Abenobashi. However, Masayuki succumbs to injuries he receives in a fall from the roof of the Grille Pelican and dies. Sasshi&#x27;s refusal to accept that reality is one of the reasons why he and Arumi are unable to return to their dimension, with Masayuki often depicted as a figure of high authority or importance in each parallel world.
:
:A voluptuous bespectacled redhead in the assorted Abenobashi dimensions in various roles from antagonist to comedic relief, which are always undertaken with great flair that stand her against even the surreal background of the hobby worlds. Mune-Mune is nearly always searching for Eutus, the reason tied to the fact that she is a parallel version of Sasshi&#x27;s paternal grandmother Mune Imamiya in her youth, Originally, in Abe&#x27;s time she was Masayuki&#x27;s wife and her falling in love with Abe led to her death by her husband&#x27;s hand. In his attempt to resolve this, Abe managed to revive Mune in the modern age. However, history nearly repeated itself and Abe left with Mune&#x27;s heart broken. She married and started a family while running the Turtle Bath before she died of natural cases. The name Mune, literally translates to &quot;chest&quot; is a pun upon her parallel self&#x27;s prominent breasts.
:
:A cross-dressing man with an overly-affectionate auntie-type attitude. Being a lifelong resident of the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade, he is quite knowledgeable about the history of the area and its people. In each parallel world, he is often depicted in various comedic female roles.
:
:Sasshi&#x27;s older sister. A stereotypical teenage girl, she is quite intent on being cool by shying away from the family&#x27;s Osaka influences. She diets and has an interest in fortune telling. Sayaka shows up within the Abenobashi dimensions accompanying Mune-mune and Ms. Aki.
:
:A shady businessman who runs a stall selling food as well as many different trinkets that may or may not be as helpful as he claims. Kouhei always seems to have a friendly aside for Sasshi and Arumi – especially when he perceives the opportunity to wring them for money. He is depicted in each parallel world as some sort of vendor.
;Arata Imamiya
:Sasshi and Sayaka&#x27;s father.
;Mitsuyo Imamiya
:Sasshi and Sayaka&#x27;s mother.
;Tarou Imamiya
:Sasshi and Sayaka&#x27;s grandfather.

<doc id="279240" wikidata="Q311063" url="?curid=279240" title="Poul Nyrup Rasmussen">
<text>Poul Oluf Nyrup Rasmussen (, informally Poul Nyrup, born 15 June 1943) is a retired Danish politician, who served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 25 January 1993 to 27 November 2001 and President of the Party of European Socialists (PES) from 2004 to 2011. He was the leader of the governing Social Democrats from 1992 to 2002 and was also a member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2009.

Rasmussen is a member of the Club of Madrid. In 2007 he published the book &quot;I grådighedens tid&quot; (&quot;In a Time of Greed&quot;), which contains harsh criticism of the role hedge and venture capital funds play in the global economy.

== Early life ==
Rasmussen was born to a working-class family on 15 June 1943 in Esbjerg, Denmark, to Oluf and Vera Eline Nyrup Rasmussen. He studied at the University of Copenhagen, earning a M.sc. degree in Economics in 1971. While studying, he was active in the social democratic student union Frit Forum, where he met some of his future political colleagues. He paid his way through university by doing several jobs, like counting traffic and being a part-time delivery boy.

== Political career ==
=== Member of the Folketing 1987–1993 ===
He was first elected to the Folketing from Western Jutland in 1987, where he became Deputy Chairman of the Social Democrats, with Svend Auken as chairman. He had together with Mogens Lykketoft made proposals for Social Democratic reforms. From 1988 to 1992 he was chairman of the Committee on Business and Trade, as well as spokesperson of Business. After the 1990 election, he was seen as a much more realistic candidate for Prime Minister than Auken.

In 1992 Rasmussen replaced Auken, the long serving leader of the Social Democrats, after his failure to form a government with the Radikale Venstre after the 1990 election, despite good results for both parties. Many in the party felt that Auken had stuck to a too left wing agenda, scuttling a possible deal with the more centrist Radikale Venstre.

=== Prime Minister 1993–2001 ===
Rasmussen came to power in early 1993 when then-Prime Minister Poul Schlüter resigned after an inquiry found that he had misinformed the Folketing about the so-called Tamil Case. A coalition of Social Democrats, Social Liberals, Centre Democrats and Christian Democrats, Rasmussen&#x27;s first cabinet made use of limited classical Keynesianism in connection with the so-called kick-start of 1993–94 as its economic policy. The Christian Democrats left the coalition after their defeat in the 1994 Folketing election, as did the Centre Democrats in late 1996. Key ministers were Economy and Deputy Prime Minister, Social Liberal leader Marianne Jelved, Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft (Social Democrats) and Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Social Liberals).

The centre-left coalition only narrowly held on to its parliamentary majority in the 1998 Folketing election. After the election Prime Minister Rasmussen stated that the government&#x27;s first order of business was to secure a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the upcoming referendum on ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty between the member states of the European Union. Eventually there were 55% &quot;yes&quot; votes in the Danish Amsterdam Treaty referendum. Rasmussen&#x27;s government later presided over the 2000 referendum on Danish participation in the euro, in which participation was rejected by 53.2% of the vote. A 1998 initiative, dubbed the Whitsun Packet (Danish: &quot;Pinsepakken&quot;) from the season it was issued, increased taxes, limiting private consumption. It was not universally popular with the electorate, which may have been a factor in the Social Democrats&#x27; defeat in the 2001 parliamentary election.

Rasmussen called an early election in 2001, saying this would give the next prime minister time to prepare for Denmark&#x27;s upcoming presidency of the European Union in 2002. The patriarchal role Rasmussen had built for himself since the 11 September attacks had gained him and the Social Liberals their highest poll ratings in years, a lead that would be eroded in the buildup to the election.

He was up against Liberal leader Anders Fogh Rasmussen. The campaign focused mainly on immigration and refugees, which worked to the benefit of the anti-immigration Danish People&#x27;s Party. Two in every three Danes now supported tighter immigration restrictions, compared to only one in two before 11 September. In the last few days of the campaign a number of predominantly left-leaning artists and intellectuals urged the Danish electorate not to vote for a rightwing government, warning that the Danish People&#x27;s Party would then be likely to wield great influence on government policy.

Other campaign focuses were on welfare and health care. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen stated the aim of creating a more robust economy to deal with the economic downturn. There was little debate about the European Union as the two leaders&#x27; opinions on that subject were largely the same. The loss of power in the 2001 election to Anders Fogh Rasmussen&#x27;s &quot;Venstre&quot; meant that the Social Democrats lost their position as the largest party in the Folketing, a position they had held without interruption since the 1924 Folketing election. On election night Rasmussen vowed to stay on as party leader, famously declaring, &quot;I will not run away with my tail between my legs.&quot; He announced an effort of &quot;renewal&quot; within the Social Democrats, urging the promotion of centrist party members to leadership positions. Influential factions opposed Rasmussen&#x27;s efforts, calling his leadership into question, and in late 2002 he announced that he would be stepping down as chairman.

=== European Parliament, 2004 ===
Rasmussen became an MEP for the Party of European Socialists after winning a record number of 407,966 votes for an individual (from Denmark) in the European Parliamentary elections in 2004. He sat on both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.

A key issue tackled by Rasmussen in the European Parliament was the lack of regulation for private equity and hedge funds. He worked to secure greater regulation in this area. starting long before the onset of the financial crisis. His report, proposing binding rules for all players as well as greater transparency and accountability, was passed by the European Parliament in September 2008. Rasmussen has since criticised the European Commission, and in particular Commission President José Manuel Durão Barroso and Commissioner Charlie McCreevy for failing to respond to the report with sufficient speed or dedication.

Rasmussen has also slammed the commission&#x27;s response to the economic crisis; in March 2009 he wrote: &quot;A new, updated Recovery Plan is needed now, otherwise there will be 25 million unemployed in 2010. There must be real coordination focused on real investments. Europe also needs to do more for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. It is in our common economic and political interest to prevent financial meltdown in those countries. Europe talks a lot about solidarity, now is the time it is really needed.&quot;

=== Party of European Socialists, 2004–2011 ===
In 2004 Rasmussen defeated Giuliano Amato to be elected President of the PES, succeeding Robin Cook in the post. He was re-elected for a further two-and-a-half years at the PES Congress in Porto on 8 December 2006. The position involved coordinating the political vision of the party, ensuring unity, chairing the party presidency and representing the party on a regular basis. As PES president he was also President of the Global Progressive Forum and sat on the committee of Transatlantic Dialogue, which fosters cooperation between progressives from the United States and Europe. Rasmussen played a central role in making the party more inclusive and oversaw the launch of the network &#x27;PES Activists&#x27;, as well as a radically participative consultation process to construct the party&#x27;s manifesto for the 2009 European election.

Rasmussen&#x27;s influence in politicising the PES can be seen in the party&#x27;s headline political initiative, New Social Europe. Based on a report written by Rasmussen and former President of the European Commission Jacques Delors, this aimed at creating a &quot;fairer, more inclusive, and more dynamic society&quot;. Currently, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.

== Personal life ==
In 1994, Rasmussen married Lone Dybkjær, a member of Folketing (and a former MEP) for the centrist Det Radikale Venstre. He enjoyed holidaying with his wife in their second house as well as swimming, walking, and reflecting with friends. He also likes listening to music. His daughter, Signe died by suicide in 1993. His wife, Lone died of breast cancer on 20 July 2020, at the age of 80.

He is not related to his two immediate successors from Venstre (i.e., a main Danish centre-right, liberal party) as Prime Minister, namely Anders Fogh Rasmussen or Lars Løkke Rasmussen.

<doc id="279274" wikidata="Q80873" url="?curid=279274" title="Azumanga Daioh">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a Japanese &quot;yonkoma&quot; comedy manga series written and illustrated by Kiyohiko Azuma. It was serialized from February 1999 to May 2002 in the monthly magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; by MediaWorks; three additional chapters were published in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Shōnen Sunday&quot; in May 2009 to celebrate the manga&#x27;s tenth anniversary. The manga was first released in English by ADV Manga, and later re-issued by Yen Press.

An anime television adaptation titled &quot;Azumanga Daioh: The Animation&quot; was produced by J.C.Staff and aired in Japan between April and September 2002, consisting of 130 four-minute segments compiled into 26 episodes. The compiled episodes were released on DVD and Universal Media Discs (UMDs) by Starchild Records, and an English-language version was produced by ADV Films. Before the series, a theatrical short and an original net animation were also produced. Several soundtrack albums were released, as well as three video games.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Both the manga and anime have been praised for their humor driven by eccentric characters, with Azuma acclaimed as a &quot;master of the four-panel form&quot; for both his art style and comic timing.

==Premise==

&quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; chronicles the everyday life in an unnamed Japanese high school of six girls: child prodigy Chiyo Mihama and her struggle to fit in with girls five years older; reserved Sakaki and her obsession with cute animals while certain ones seem to hate her; spacey Ayumu &quot;Osaka&quot; Kasuga with a skewed perspective on the world; Koyomi &quot;Yomi&quot; Mizuhara&#x27;s aggravation at an annoying best friend; Tomo Takino, whose energy is rivaled only by her lack of sense; sporty Kagura and her one-sided athletics rivalry with Sakaki.

Secondary characters include homeroom teacher Yukari Tanizaki, her friend, physical education teacher Minamo &quot;Nyamo&quot; Kurosawa, and the creepy classical literature teacher Kimura. The story covers three years of tests, talking between classes, culture festivals, and athletic events at school, as well as time spent traveling to and from school, studying at Chiyo&#x27;s house, and vacations at Chiyo&#x27;s summer beach home and the fictional theme park Magical Land, concluding with the graduation of the main cast. It is generally realistic in tone, marked by occasional bursts of surrealism and absurdity, such as Osaka imagining Chiyo&#x27;s ponytails being &quot;unscrewed&quot; from her head and an episode featuring the characters&#x27; New Year&#x27;s dreams.

==Production==
The series title has no particular significance to the story. &quot;Azumanga&quot; is a portmanteau of the author&#x27;s name &quot;Azuma&quot; and &quot;manga&quot;, while &quot;Daioh&quot; comes from the magazine in which it was originally published, &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;. In the anime, &quot;daioh&quot; is mentioned during the next episode previews, used in context with the meaning &quot;great king&quot;.

&quot;Azumanga&quot; is also used as a general term for Kiyohiko Azuma&#x27;s other comics and illustrations. Two previous collections of Azuma&#x27;s works, including official tie-in comics of Pioneer animations, were published as &quot;Azumanga&quot; and &quot;Azumanga 2&quot; in 1998 and 2001, respectively. &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; was later republished in a reduced-size edition called &quot;Azumanga Recycle&quot;.

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; was written and illustrated by Kiyohiko Azuma, largely in &quot;yonkoma&quot; (four-panel) format. The unnumbered chapters were serialized by MediaWorks in the monthly magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; from February 1999 to May 2002. The series was collected in four volumes. Each of the four volumes covers about a year in the characters&#x27; lives. A new edition in three volumes was released in Japan by Shogakukan to commemorate the manga&#x27;s 10th anniversary, with volume one, covering the first year of high school, being published June 11, 2009. The reprint edition contains three additional 16-page chapters serialized in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Sunday&quot; starting in May 2009 under the title .

The series was licensed in English in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Manga, which released all four volumes between 2003 and 2004. ADV later reprinted the series in an omnibus edition () on November 7, 2007. In 2009, Yen Press acquired the North American and UK license of &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, and released a new translation in December 2009 in an omnibus volume. In Europe, &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; is licensed in French by Kurokawa, in German by Tokyopop, in Spanish by Norma Editorial, in Finnish by Punainen jättiläinen and in Russian by Palm Press. In Asia, the series has been licensed in Korean by Daiwon C.I., in Thai by Negibose Comics, in Vietnam by TVM Comics, and in Chinese by Tong Li Publishing. It was also translated into Brazilian Portuguese by NewPOP Editora. It was the first &quot;yonkoma&quot; manga translated in France.

===Anime===

The anime television series, &quot;Azumanga Daioh: the Animation&quot;, was produced by J.C.Staff and aired from the week of April 8, 2002 until the week of September 30, 2002. It was broadcast on TV Tokyo, TV Aichi, TV Osaka, and AT-X in five-minute segments every weekday, then repeated as a 25-minute compilation that weekend, for a total of 130 five-minute segments collected in 26 episodes. For the compilation episodes, the respective opening and ending themes were and &quot;Raspberry Heaven&quot;, both performed by Oranges &amp; Lemons. The compilation episodes, which were the only versions to include the title and credits sequences, were released on 6 DVDs in 2003 and 9 Universal Media Discs between 2005 and 2006 by Starchild Records, and a DVD box set of all episodes was released on June 24, 2009; the five-minute segments can be distinguished by their individual titles.

Besides the anime television series, there have been two other animated adaptations: &quot;The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie&quot;, a six-minute trailer released to movie theaters to publicize the then-upcoming television series, and &quot;Azumanga Web Daioh&quot;, a shorter original net animation made available for paid streaming on chara-ani.com beginning from December 28, 2000, then offered as a paid download for a limited time. &quot;Azumanga Web Daioh&quot; was originally intended to gauge whether there was enough interest to create a web-released anime adaptation; because of overwhelming demand, the original plan for web-release was changed to a television release. It featured different voice actors, music, and staff from the series.

In the United States, the anime television series was released in six DVDs on September 9, 2005, and then later in a five DVD volume &quot;Thinpak&quot; set, both by ADV Films. The sixth DVD volume included &quot;The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie&quot;. In 2009, Nokia offered the first five episodes of &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; on its Ovi phone service. Madman Entertainment licensed the series for release in Australia and New Zealand. As of September 1, 2009, all of ADV&#x27;s former catalog are transferred to AEsir Holdings, with distribution from Section23 Films. The series was later re-licensed in 2016 by Sentai Filmworks.

==Reception==

Both the manga and anime have been praised for their humor driven by eccentric characters, with Azuma acclaimed as a &quot;master of the four-panel form&quot; for both his art style and comic timing. In Japan, the &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; manga was named a jury recommended work of the sixth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2002. The manga was named as one of the top 25 manga at the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival.

English reviewers have commented positively about &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson refers to it as a &quot;charming comedy&quot; and a &quot;quiet master of the four-panel form&quot;, praising the series comedic timing and use of running gags. He felt one of the series&#x27; best points was its &quot;character-driven writing&quot;, but does warn that its &quot;moe&quot; nature and the jokes that revolve around the &quot;vaguely pedophilic teacher&quot; might disturb some newer readers of manga. He later said that &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; was an &quot;almost totally innocent&quot; kind of &quot;moe&quot;, centered around &quot;peep[ing] at the chaste world of girls&quot;, in which &quot;adorable girls do adorable things&quot;. The French manga dictionary &quot;Dicomanga&quot; noted that despite being a &quot;moe&quot; series targeted at &quot;otaku&quot;, it also appealed to female readers for celebrating &quot;friendships between girls as well as [its] comedy&quot;. Marc Hairston describes &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; as being &quot;slightly disjointed&quot;, with &quot;frequently oblique&quot; and &quot;culturally biased&quot; humour, and says it is both &quot;lighter&quot; and &quot;more wry&quot; than &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot;. He describes the characters of &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; as being &quot;individuals with slightly offbeat personalities&quot;. Mark Thomas, writing for Mania.com, says that each character has &quot;a defining personality trait that is ramped up to abnormal levels&quot; and that each has a foil, which highlights these traits and prevents them from becoming too annoying or unbelievable as characters. Thomas said that the yonkoma format does not lend itself to &quot;complex story arcs&quot;, and the story is presented as &quot;quick snapshots of random moments in their daily routines&quot;, noting that the narrative is character-driven. Patrick King, writing for Anime Fringe, considered it to be &quot;one of the funniest, most adorable manga series I&#x27;ve read&quot;. IGN noted the lack of background art, but said that the expressive faces of the characters made up for it.

Fred Patton of &quot;Animation World Magazine&quot; described the anime as &quot;delightfully witty and even an educational window onto what Japanese high school life is really like&quot;. Chris Beveridge of &quot;Anime on DVD&quot;, stated that &quot;There&#x27;s a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don&#x27;t.&quot; Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that &quot;The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is just so much meaning, and charm, in even the most minor of expressions.&quot; The reviewers of THEM Anime Reviews and Anime News Network felt that fans who had already graduated high school would feel nostalgic at times while watching &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;. Lauren Bryant of Art Decko Magazine, noted that the series is &quot;filled with silly gags and hijinks&quot;, having a &quot;lighthearted humor&quot; with &quot;very minimalist&quot; animation, and said that the show makes Kaori &quot;overtly gay&quot; as she has a crush on Sakaki. However, Bryant criticized Kimura for being &quot;vaguely paedophilic&quot;, but called the series on the whole &quot;very wholesome and hilarious&quot;.

The licensed manga had sales that reached top 100 lists on occasions and was included in the top 25 manga recommended by International Correspondence in &quot;Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga&quot;. The English dub for the show was well received, earning six ADR Awards from fans voting on AnimeonDVD.com and Dubreview.com. Four of the girls were included in &quot;Newtype&quot;″s top 100 anime heroines of 2002: Osaka was awarded 7th, Chiyo 11th, Sakaki 21st, and Yomi 78th. Together, they made &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; the second most popular series of 2002 for female characters.

<text>Afeni Shakur Davis (born Alice Faye Williams; January 10, 1947 – May 2, 2016) was an American political activist and member of the Black Panther Party. Shakur was the mother of rapper Tupac Shakur and the executor of his estate. She founded the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation and was the CEO of Amaru Entertainment, Inc., a record and film production company she founded.

==Early life==
Afeni Shakur was born Alice Williams on January 10, 1947, in Lumberton, North Carolina. She had an older sister, Gloria &quot;Glo&quot; Jean. At the age of eleven in 1958, Williams and her sister moved to the South Bronx with their mother, a factory worker.

Williams attended Benjamin Franklin Junior High School in the Bronx, where she demonstrated above average reading ability and her grades qualified her for honors. She wrote for the school newspaper, &quot;The Franklin Flash&quot;, and in the ninth grade, won a journalism award for which she received congratulations from Mayor Robert F. Wagner. In 1962, Williams passed the qualifying examinations for the Bronx High School of Science and High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. She chose the latter because she felt performers and actors were free spirited. However, Williams could not afford the school supplies and she felt like an outcast at the school, so she dropped out after one term. She began drifting and became a member of a Bronx street gang called the Disciples.

She briefly worked a postal job, becoming one of the first woman mail carriers in New York.

== Activism ==
After hearing Bobby Seale speak, Williams joined the Black Panther Party when they opened an office in Harlem in 1968. There she met Lumumba Shakur, a Sunni Muslim, whom she married in November 1968. Following their marriage, she changed her name to Afeni Shakur. She became a section leader of the Harlem chapter and a mentor to new members such as Jamal Joseph. 

===The Panther 21===

In April 1969, she and twenty other Black Panthers were arrested and charged with several counts of conspiracy to bomb police stations and other public places in New York. Bail was set at $100,000 () for each of the 21 suspects. The Black Panthers decided to raise bail money for Joseph and Shakur first, so those two could work on raising bail for the remaining 19 members. The pre-trial started in February 1970 and the actual trial commenced on September 8, 1970. Charges brought against her and the other members of the Black Panther Party were attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to bomb buildings, and conspiracy. Shakur represented herself at trial, interviewing several witnesses and arguing in court. In her autobiography, Shakur wrote, &quot;I was young. I was arrogant. And I was brilliant in court... because I thought this was the &quot;last&quot; time I could speak. The last time before they locked me up forever... I was writing my own obituary.&quot; Her statements and questioning of the government infiltrators during the trial are credited with helping to expose the FBI&#x27;s corruption and help save the Panther 21.

One of the people Shakur cross-examined was Ralph White, a &quot;suspect&quot; who had, in fact, infiltrated the Black Panthers while working as an undercover policeman. Shakur had repeatedly denounced White as a cop because he was &quot;a hothead ... too arrogant for a Panther.&quot; White testified it was retaliation for refusing to hire her to work in the Harlem Panther office. Shakur got White to admit under oath that he and two other agents had organized most of the unlawful activities. &quot;She asked him if he&#x27;d ever seen her carry a gun or kill anyone or bomb anything and he answered no, no, no. Then she asked if he&#x27;d seen her doing Panther organizing in a school and a hospital and on the streets and he answered, yes, yes, yes.&quot;

She and the others in the &quot;Panther 21&quot; were acquitted in May 1971 after an eight-month trial. Altogether, Afeni Shakur spent two years in the New York Women&#x27;s House of Detention before being acquitted. While in the House of Detention, Shakur says, she &quot;began relating to the gay sisters in jail beginning to understand their oppression, their anger and the strength in them and in all gay people.&quot; After being released, she participated in a workshop organized by the Gay Liberation Front at the Revolutionary People&#x27;s Constitutional Convention in 1970, and she continued to advocate against homophobia in the Black Panthers.

=== Bedford Hill Correctional Facility ===
As a paralegal, Shakur often worked in New York&#x27;s only women&#x27;s prison at the time, the Bedford Hill Correctional Facility.

Shakur played a large role in the case &quot;Crooks v. Warne&quot; involving Bedford inmate, Carol Crooks. Shakur and Crooks met while they were both incarcerated at the Women&#x27;s House of Detention, and are suspected to have taken on a romantic relationship with one another that ended with Shakur&#x27;s release from prison. Following the events of what would come to be known as the August Rebellion, Shakur helped connect Crooks to prisoner&#x27; rights attorney, Steven Latimer. The case was ruled in Crooks&#x27; favor and won incarcerated women the right to due process prior to their being sent to segregated prison, or solitary confinement.

While working with the South Bronx Legal Services in 1973, Shakur helped organize a day of solidarity for families and friends of the Bedford Hill Correctional Facility for Women.

== Later life and death ==
After Shakur was acquitted, she did not return to the Black Panther Party. On June 16, 1971, she gave birth to her son, Lesane Parish Crooks, who was later renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur. Shakur&#x27;s marriage fell apart when it was discovered that Lumumba was not the biological father of her son. His biological father is Billy Garland.

In 1975, Shakur married Mutulu Shakur and had their daughter, Sekyiwa. They divorced in 1982. Shakur worked as a paralegal with Bronx Legal Services and was a union member of the Legal Services Staff Association for a decade before leaving the state and descending into a crack cocaine addiction in the early 1980s.

Shakur moved her son and daughter to Baltimore, Maryland in 1984. She relocated to a family friend&#x27;s home in Marin County, California to manage her drug use. In 1989, her son left home because of her. The two later reconciled. She overcame her addiction after she moved back to New York in 1991 and started Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Nine months into her recovery program, Tupac sent her $5,000 even though their relationship was strained.

Although Tupac struggled in his relationship with his mother, he paid tribute to her in his song &quot;Dear Mama&quot;. In the song, he reflects on his childhood, acknowledges Afeni&#x27;s troubles with addiction, and expresses his love for her: &quot;And even as a crack fiend mama, you always was a black queen mama, I finally understand for a woman it ain&#x27;t easy tryin&#x27; to raise a man, you always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it, there&#x27;s no way I can pay you back, but the plan is to show you that I understand you are appreciated.&quot;

After Tupac died in Las Vegas on September 13, 1996, she had him cremated the next day. His close friends, actresses Jada Pinkett and Jasmine Guy, provided emotional support for Shakur and advised her to hire lawyers to sort out Tupac&#x27;s assets.

In 2004, Shakur released her biography, &quot;Afeni Shakur: Evolution of a Revolutionary&quot;. In her biography, which was written by Jasmine Guy, Shakur reflected on her childhood experiences and her upbringing as well as her involvement in the Black Panther Party. In the book, she stated that the party educated and directed her to channel her anger. She described her experiences in jail and how together with other inmates, they organized a bail fund to get some of the women out of jail.

Shakur traveled across the U.S., making guest appearances and delivering lectures. On February 6, 2009, she gave the keynote address for Vanderbilt University&#x27;s Commemoration for Black History Month. She shared with people her experiences and ways in which to overcome loss.

Shakur later married Gust Davis.

Shakur died at a hospital in Greenbrae, California, at around 10:28 p.m. on May 2, 2016, after going into cardiac arrest at her home earlier in the evening; she was 69. Her body was cremated.

== Estate of Tupac Shakur ==
Following her son&#x27;s death, Tupac&#x27;s biological father Billy Garland attempted to inherit half of his estate, which Shakur opposed because Garland was an &quot;absentee father who contributed little to Tupac&#x27;s upbringing.&quot; A judge denied his claim.

Exactly one year after Tupac&#x27;s death, with revenue from his albums released posthumously, Shakur founded the Georgia-based Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation to provide art programs for young people and the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts in Stone Mountain, Georgia.

In 1997, she founded Amaru Entertainment, a holding company for all of Tupac&#x27;s unreleased material. She also launched a fashion clothing line, Makaveli Branded in 2003.

Shakur was reportedly in federal court on July 20, 2007, to file an injunction to prevent Death Row Records from selling any unreleased material from Tupac after the company failed to prove that the unreleased songs were not part of its bankruptcy settlement.

In 2013, Shakur sued Entertainment One claiming they failed to pay Tupac&#x27;s estate royalties worth seven figures for 2007’s &quot;Beginnings: The Lost Tapes&quot;. The estate also sued for the ownership of the master recordings for all of Tupac’s unreleased music. A court ruled Entertainment One must pay over six figures for royalties from Shakur&#x27;s posthumous releases and all the unreleased recordings would go back to the estate. Death Row Records initially owned the rights to his music, which was purchased by Entertainment One in 2006. On September 29th, 2018, the Shakur Estate won the case against Entertainment One.

In 2014, Shakur helped create the Broadway musical &quot;Holler If Ya Hear Me&quot;, which featured Tupac&#x27;s music.

Shakur was not involved in the production of &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, a film based on Tupac&#x27;s life, stating she felt betrayed by her lawyer, who made the deal with the production company Morgan Creek against her wishes. When she learned of the deal, she fired her lawyer, hired new ones, and fought against the contract and production company. She went to court several times, spending millions of dollars, which she stated led to her selling the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts, eventually settling for an undisclosed amount of money.

Shakur set up a trust to control all of Tupac&#x27;s music rights which assigned music executive Tom Whalley as the executor of his estate following her death in 2016.
